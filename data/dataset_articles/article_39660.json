  "text": "Missing cat hybrid safely returned home in Hoover\nVideo above was a report before the cat returned home\nAn African Savannah cat is back home Sunday afternoon after an eight-day search when he went on the prowl in Hoover.\nThis big cat hybrid is a woman's pet. He managed to jerk his leash from his owner’s hand more than a week ago during a walk.\nHis name is Viper. He looks more like an African serval than a house cat, but he's a mix of both. To owner Suzzan Fant, he's a part of the family.\nYour neighborhood:\nLocal coverage from WVTM 13\nShe was desperate to find him.\n“I'm trying to be strong, but the longer it goes, the more I'm realizing I might not see him again,\" she said.\nFant had already brought in a team of bloodhounds to track the cat on Sunday when a neighbor reported seeing him in the same area where he disappeared in Bluff Park.\nShe said the neighbors saw him in their front yard stuck somewhere.\n\"They grabbed his leash, but he wiggled out of it with his collar,\" Fant said.\nThey told her which direction he went and she was able to find him.\nFant posted a video and photos on social media.\n“I don't have kids, so they're like my babies. They're my kids,” Fant said.\nThey're very expensive animals, costing upward of $10,000 each. Fant says they're wonderful house pets. She has three of them.\n>> FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL:\nInstagram | YouTube\n“They're extremely intelligent and they're very playful. They're amazing hunters. They're very loyal to usually one member of the family,\" she said.",
