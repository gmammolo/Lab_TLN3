  "text": "If you're still using a traditional iron to get the creases out of your clothes, maybe it’s time to make a new year’s resolution and ditch it for more effective garment steamer. A decent clothes steamer will leave any item in your wardrobe looking pristine in much less time than it takes you to iron it. Handheld models are great for keeping clothes fresh on-the-go, quick touch-ups and storing in smaller bedrooms.

It is gentler on your clothes than ironing. Used by charity shops, the fashion industry and theatres, Propress has been a renowned clothes steamer brand for more than 40 years. Now the firm is aiming to bring the devices to the masses so you can say goodbye to your ironing board for good. Its Mini handheld steamer heats up impressively fast, which is perfect for those who are in a hurry. It is ultra-portable and can deliver effortless crease-free clothes at home or in the office or on holidays. Propress Mini smooths out creases, restores fabric shapes, and removes odours while killing 99.9 percent ofbacteria, ensuring your clothes stay fresh and last longer. The steamer can be used vertically or horizontally, for ultimate flexibility and it comes complete with a travel bag, steam mitt and a detachable 130ml water tank for easy storage and portability. There is also a Big Belly tank option, which boosts the water capacity to 230ml and the steaming time to 13 minutes. There are two steam modes to suit your needs: on demand and continuous. In my tests, it removed all creases quickly and was especially effective on cotton, polycotton and linen. And the head doubles as an iron which was handy for getting rid of more stubborn wrinkles. There are three colour options: a blue hue, a grey and a powder pink.
