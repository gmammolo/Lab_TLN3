  "text": "This article was one of Herald Entertainment’s best-read stories of 2023\nLast September, Sam Wallace had a sobering epiphany. He was out of shape, didn’t have energy for his kids and was drinking after work to avoid being a “grumpy old dad”. Forty-four weeks later, he has completely turned his life around and the results speak for themselves.\nTaking to Instagram, The Coast radio star has shared a series of photos from his recent health journey that has had him first go from 89kg to 92kg. Now, with months of unwavering commitment, he has reached a muscle heavy 85kg which is a maintainable weight for the 42-year-old. But he admits, it hasn’t been an easy - or a fast - journey.\nSpeaking to the Herald , Wallace explains, that a transformational health journey isn’t something he is a stranger to, in fact, he has done it multiple times before, but this time was entirely different.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. “I’d normally really start to see results at eight weeks,” he says, “and now that I’m 42, I didn’t really start to see any results until about 16 weeks this time. I think, for a lot of people, when you start to see results, that’s the thing that spurs you on.\n“That’s the sad truth. It actually, does take longer, especially as we get older to get back into shape.”",
