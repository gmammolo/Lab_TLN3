  "text": "Awards season has officially begun, and ushering us into three months of [beautiful gowns](https://www.byrdie.com/best-oscars-red-carpet-looks-5221558) were the 2024 Golden Globes. After a tumultuous few years that ultimately resulted in significant [organizational changes](https://people.com/golden-globes-changing-ownership-as-hfpa-sells-rights-to-awards-show-after-years-of-controversy-7511275), no one knew exactly what to expect from the historically raucous awards show. But if there's one thing we knew we could count on, it was many memorable red-carpet moments. With fashionable nominees including [Margot Robbie](https://www.byrdie.com/margot-robbie-skin-and-makeup) (whose [\"Barbie\" press tour ensembles](https://www.byrdie.com/margot-robbie-barbie-chrome-manicure-7555995) became the stuff of sartorial legend), [Emma Stone](https://www.byrdie.com/emma-stone-poor-things-red-carpet-bun-8411917), Greta Lee, and Da'Vine Joy Randolph alongside perenially-chic presenters including Julia Garner, Angela Bassett, and [Amanda Seyfried](https://www.byrdie.com/amanda-seyfried-makeup-critics-choice-awards-2023-7095764), the Golden Globes were bound to deliver Glamour with a capital \"G\"—and deliver they did. Read on for some of our favorite looks of the night. Jeannie Mai Television personality Jeannie Mai kept her accessories pared back, letting her shimmering black column gown—accented with white pearls—take center stage. Zuri Hall \"Access Hollywood\" correspondent Zuri Hall hit two of the biggest trends of the moment, with oversized [bows](https://www.byrdie.com/bow-fashion-and-beauty-trend-7255702) running down the back of her [bright red](https://www.byrdie.com/scarlet-red-fashion-trend-7897043) gown.",
