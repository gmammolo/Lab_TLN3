  "text": "The 2024 Golden Globes have officially arrived to kick off awards season, and we're anticipating a big night for beauty looks. While [last year's beauty landscape](https://www.byrdie.com/best-golden-globes-beauty-looks-2023-7093214) was all about '90s supermodel glam (think: [Pamela Anderson buns](https://www.byrdie.com/pamela-anderson-hair-inspo-7197753) and [fluffy blowouts](https://www.byrdie.com/undone-blowout-trend-7369587)), we saw fairly muted makeup and manicures. So this year, it's only natural that the maximalist renaissance—which began to lay seeds in late 2023—will continue in full force this awards season to balance the scales. So tonight, we'll have our eyes peeled for antithetical takes on [Barbiecore](https://www.byrdie.com/barbiecore-beauty-trend-6361979) (Margot Robbie is nominated for her titular role), unexpected twists on the bow trend, and messy, maximalist beauty looks galore. We'll be curating our personal favorites all night long—and with stars like [Jennifer Lawrence](https://www.byrdie.com/jennifer-lawrence-glazed-nails-7484835), [Emma Stone](https://www.byrdie.com/emma-stone-poor-things-red-carpet-bun-8411917), Greta Lee, and [Selena Gomez ](https://www.byrdie.com/selena-gomez-best-fashion-moments-7369829)expected to attend, tonight's red carpet is sure to set the tone for the rest of awards season. Discover all of our favorite beauty looks from the 2024 Golden Globes, ahead. Jeannie Mai Jenkins Jeannie Mai Jenkins is walking the red carpet in wispy, gossamer lashes paired with the perfect pinky nude lip. Zuri Hall Zuri Hall's red lip is the perfect complement to her eyelash-grazing fringe and glowy, lit-from-within complexion makeup. Quinta Brunson Quinta Brunson is going monochromatic with blush, shadow, and glossy lids painted in a muted mauve. For hair, she's opted for glossy, cascading waves tucked behind the ears. Sandra Hüller Anatomy of a Fall star Sandra Hüller is nominated in the Drama category this evening and is fittingly wearing a bold beauty look. Hüller is wearing a saturated red lip that contrasts beautifully with her bright green gown, topping the look with a side-parted updo.",
