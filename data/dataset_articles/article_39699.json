  "text": "SAVANNAH, Ga. — Popular Food Network chef Gina Willis cooked a Gullah Geechee brunch to support the Forsyth farmers market.\n\"We understand that we have to sustain our food system by our farmers, so therefore, we make sure that we do everything we can to support them,\" said Deidre Grim.\nAdvertisement Grim is the executive director of the market. She partnered with renowned Willis to provide the full Gullah Geechee brunch.\n\"I'm very proud. I love to be able to share the culture, the dishes, you know, the traditions. And so it's just an important part that I live every day,\" Willis said.\nGrim says Gullah Geechee meals are made based on using fresh resources, which Willis used to make her gumbo and Carolina gold grits.\n\"Sure, I hate to say it, unfortunately, but our ancestors were forced into indentured servitude. Right. And so, we work the land, but we came with that knowledge from Africa,\" Grim said.\nTop Picks 'Oppenheimer' dominates Golden Globes, 'Poor Things' upsets 'Barbie' in comedy Amazon has a secret warehouse section where you don't pay full price for items 11-year-old killed in Iowa school shooting was a joyful boy known as 'Smiley,' his mother says New categories, new voters: Here are the major changes to the Golden Globes this year",
