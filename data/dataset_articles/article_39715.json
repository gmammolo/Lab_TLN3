  "text": "The Boston Celtics secured their second consecutive blowout win at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on Saturday night, defeating the Indiana Pacers 118-101 with a dominant performance on both ends of the court led by star Celtics forward Jayson Tatum with 38 points, 13 rebounds, and 6 assists.\nTatum’s hot shooting, efficient playmaking, and aggressive rebounding led the Celtics to victory, while fellow All-NBA forward Jaylen Brown helped lock up the opposing team’s best players. The Celtics responded to a Pacers run in the third quarter by stepping up in the fourth, maintaining composure. And Tatum’s killer instinct in the fourth quarter was a key factor in the team’s victory. Boston held Indiana to their lowest-scoring game of the season, getting a modicum of revenge for their ouster from the in-season tournament by the Pacers.\nThe hosts of the CLNS Media”How Bout Them Celtics!” podcast weighed in on the victory on a recent episode.\nCheck it out above!\nListen to the “ Celtics Lab ” podcast on:\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3F9DvjQ\nMore .Analysis Delon Wright, Alec Burks join Kelly Olynyk as proposed Celtics trade targets\nFollow all of your favorite New England teams at Celtics Wire and Patriots Wire !",
