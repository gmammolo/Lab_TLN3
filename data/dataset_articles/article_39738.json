  "text": "The day I discovered that my dog was the brilliant writer behind the famous fantasy bestseller \"Fush Naemon,\" everything changed. All those stories I had devoured turned out to be fragments of his otherworldly life, shared as an online diary after having lived a full existence in a fantasy realm following an accident in his childhood. With the most adorable and talented author I could have ever imagined, I am determined to become her apprentice and immerse myself in the art of storytelling. My goal is to write a story as riveting as his. Between the lessons of this unusual mentor and his magic-filled pages, I will seek to unlock the secrets to creating extraordinary worlds and characters. This is the chronicle of how my dog became my teacher, teaching me to find the magic in words and to weave adventures as captivating as his. - Overall Score - - Style Score - - Story Score - - Grammar Score - - Character Score - - Total Views : - 7 - Average Views : - 2 - Followers : - 0 - Favorites : - 0 - Ratings : - 0 - Pages : - 27 [Go to Table of Contents](#toc) [Fiction breaking rules?
