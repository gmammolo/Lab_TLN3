I used thin pizza dough that when you roll out is square.\nStep 1\nRoll the pizza dough out on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Turn the baking sheet horizontally.\nStep 2\nWith a sharp knife, gently draw a heart shape in the middle of the dough. Don’t cut all the way through the dough, this is just to make a visible mark.\nStep 3\nCut an inch outside of the line you drew with the knife. This area will be the dough crust. Remove the access dough to save for later.\nStep 4\nShape the pizza to be a heart. Use the extra dough for added areas of crust where you need it.\nFor fun, shape some small hearts out of the extra dough. These will be cute later in your presentation.\nYou might also love these recipes:\nOut of this world Nutella French Toast Valentine Minnie Mouse Cookie Pops Easy Strawberry Pie Strawberry Chocolate Kiss Cookies\nHow Long Do You Bake Fruit Pizza Crust?\nNow that you’ve got your heart shaped pizza dough ready to go, it’s time to bake the crust!\nIf using refrigerated pizza dough, you’ll want to bake the pizza dough at 400 degrees for 8 minutes.\nStrawberry and Nutella Dessert Pizza\nWhile the pizza dough is cooking, cut 6-8 fresh strawberries in half and shape like hearts.\nThis is very simple as the strawberries already look very similar to hearts.
