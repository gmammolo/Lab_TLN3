  "text": "Commentary\nWhat They Found in a Pineapple Stem Could Revolutionize Medicine\nModern medicine has stumbled upon a breakthrough made possible by a humble, everyday fruit.\nA new cream derived from enzymes contained in the stems of pineapples has shown promising results for burn patients of New York’s Stony Brook Medicine.\nRecently approved by the FDA and made commercially available on Sept. 20, the cream, called NexoBrid, uses the enzyme bromelain to essentially dissolve away the burned skin, allowing severe burns to heal without the need for surgery and skin grafts,\nFox News reported.\nAccording to local news outlet\nWLSN-TV, Dr. Steven Sandoval, director of the burn center at Stony Brook Medicine, explained that “bromelain actually does all the work for us.”\nDr. Adam Singer, an emergency medicine physician at Stony Brook, told Fox New, “You apply it to the burn, and within four hours, it dissolves the burn tissue. It’s very selective — so the minute it hits normal tissue that is not burned, it stops dissolving.”\nOne of the first beneficiaries of this new treatment was Charles Garrison, who suffered severe burns after an incident with his backyard fire pit.\nAccording to local news outlet\nWANE-TV, Garrison said, “It flashed up, and the gas came out, hit my leg, and I went up like a torch. The pants I was wearing melted, and when I took the pants off that were on fire, the skin slid off the leg.”\nThankfully, what would have been an excruciating, months-long surgical process involving numerous skin grafts is now exponentially accelerated by the application of NexoBrid.\nIn fact, Garrison’s scars are expected to look as good, or even better, than the ones he would have received from the traditional skin-grafting surgery.\nAs Dr. Singer said, this new treatment is “basically turning a surgical disease into a medical disease that’s treated at the bedside instead of in the operating room,” Fox reported.\nNexoBrid on the whole appears to be a promising treatment, bringing a difficult and painful procedure into the 21st Century.\nSo far, this treatment promises a whole new world of healing and relief for the millions of people afflicted by severe burns just like Garrison.\nIndeed, this story just exemplifies the\nawe-inspiring capabilities latent within God’s creation.\nWho would ever have guessed that the pineapple contained within itself the enzyme that made Garrison’s almost\nmiraculous recovery from his horrific injuries possible?\nOf course, this discovery would never have been possible without people being\ngood stewards of God’s creation.\nGod put animals and plants on this earth for our use, to be sure, but we must be mindful to use those gifts wisely and to\npreserve them for future generations.\nGod promises us rewards for following His commandments and responsibly stewarding His creation. When we do that, sometimes, as in the case of this revolutionary new treatment, the rewards are crystal clear.\nTruth and Accuracy\nWe are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.\n Read our editorial standards.",
