  "text": "It was a year full of ups and downs, but now, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are NFC South champions.\nThe team clinched the division with a win over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday, and although it was a rough 9-0 victory, it was exactly what Tampa Bay needed to go to the playoffs. This is the fourth year in a row the Bucs are headed to the playoffs and the third year in a row they clinched the NFC South, and of course, Bucs fans had a lot to say about it — and they brought receipts from the beginning of the year.\nHere is what Bucs fans and neutral observers had to say after the game:\nBucs were pretty bad today. Multiple dropped INTs by Panthers. Panthers fumble at inch yard line. Have Panthers TD called back by a formation penalty that had nothing to do with play. Missed Panthers FG.\nFound a way though. Back to the playoffs again. Happy for Bucs fans.\n— Jon Ledyard (@LedyardNFLDraft) January 7, 2024\n0-0 Go Bucs!\n— Dave Canales (@DcoachCanales) January 7, 2024\nWinfield has saved the Bucs 10 points today\n— Jon Ledyard (@LedyardNFLDraft) January 7, 2024\n“You must be on crack if you think the Bucs will somehow sneak into the Super Bowl and win it all”\nMe: pic.twitter.com/kJENa0bAPt\n— 𝗗𝗝 (@DJBucsFan) January 7, 2024\nBaker Mayfield:\n– Browns dump him after winning a playoff game, trade him to Panthers\n– Panthers dump him after not even a full season on terrible roster, Rams claim him\n– Rams claim him, plays well in short run in LA\n– Bucs sign him, leads team to division title\nAmazing pic.twitter.com/ZkVCuj9fT4\n— Josh Callaway (@JoshMCallaway) January 7, 2024\nBaker took the Winless Browns to the playoffs and now the Brady-less Bucs to the playoffs.\nDude is a true competitor\n— Will Blackmon 🍷 (@WillBlackmon) January 7, 2024\nNFC SOUTH CHAMPS AGAIN BABY! pic.twitter.com/iQivavS6LY\n— • Christie • ❤️ (@AllAboutBucs) January 7, 2024\nCongrats to Baker Mayfield for leading the Bucs to the playoffs replacing the GOAT. It wasn't pretty, but it was 9-0. I give the Bucs a good shot of winning a home playoff game against the Eagles.\n— Skip Bayless (@RealSkipBayless) January 7, 2024\n“Bucs are tanking…”\n“Lol, from Brady to Baker Mayfield…”\n“Tampa Bay will go back to who they were before…”\n“Second-worst team in the league…” pic.twitter.com/D361jablmE\n— Josh Hill (@jdavhill) January 7, 2024\nNFC SOUTH THREE-PEAT\nFOUR-STRAIGHT PLAYOFF APPEARANCES\nTHE.

Talk about leading and maximizing a roster. pic.twitter.com/93pNWowIrl\n— Cameron Wolfe (@CameronWolfe) January 7, 2024\nThe Yaya Diaby and Calijah Kancey sack celebration has been a Top-5 development in the Bucs 2023-24 season.\n— Evan Closky (@ECloskyWTSP) January 7, 2024\nIn July, the Bucs had the worst odds to win the NFC South at +700.\nTODAY, BAKER MAYFIELD GOT IT DONE 😤 pic.twitter.com/CwiwJcylad\n— FanDuel Sportsbook (@FDSportsbook) January 7, 2024\nBAKER MAYFIELD AND THE TB BUCS ARE NFC SOUTH CHAMPS AND HEADING TO THE PLAYOFFS 🥳🥳\nNot bad after taking over for the GOAT😌😌 #GoBucs pic.twitter.com/WoopQvGVsB\n— Missy (@Melissa_OU6) January 7, 2024\nEven if the Bucs win today, Bowles shouldn't be safe. They had a four game winning streak but then two playoff lock games against division opponents (in a trash division) and they look like a high school team\n— Chris (@CynicalBucsFan) January 7, 2024\nDon't care how ugly this is today. Winning is the only standard for this one. If anything, a lackluster performance now makes a good performance next week even more likely.\nThat said, the Bucs' actual health most certainly matters. Hope Mayfield feels better with another week.\n— Bobby Fenton (@bobbygameday) January 7, 2024\nThe MVP for the #Bucs is GM Jason Licht. He built what he could, with no money. The team was supposed to lose just about every game but won 9.\n— Dan Lucas (@WFLADan) January 7, 2024\n“Bucs 2-15”\n“Bucs aren’t nothing without Brady”\n“Bucs going to be the worst team in the NFL”\nUs with another Playoff berth\npic.twitter.com/m3vUZ1c4mv\n— Jared Kight (@Jarebear81787) January 7, 2024\nThey told me the Bucs would be at the bottom of the division before the season started LMFAOOOO\n— Austin 🫠 (@iAustin813) January 7, 2024\nI’m all in on this Bucs team heading into next week btw. I’m a sicko weirdo freak, I believe in this team. Feed me the Eagles, feed me the Cowboys I DO NOT CARE MAN #GoBucs pic.twitter.com/BUTn3QNEhE\n— Andrew⚡️ (@813Drew) January 7, 2024\nLooking for the \"Bucs are gonna tank for Caleb Williams\" and \"Baker Mayfield is gonna ruin Mike Evans' 1,000-yard streak\" folks like pic.twitter.com/MqLxyKglL0\n— Luke Easterling (@LukeEasterling) January 7, 2024",
