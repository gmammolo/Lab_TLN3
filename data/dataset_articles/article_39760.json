  "text": "THUNDER BAY -- A former employer of Jenna Ostberg will remember the young woman as a “quiet but effective leader.”\nOstberg is the 21-year-old woman who died on Dec. 30 after the Thunder Bay Police Service failed to respond to two 911 calls at 2 am.\nThe calls were for a domestic disturbance at a home on Ray Boulevard. The first was a call for help and the second was a call to cancel the assistance.\nTBPS also received a third call from the same home – indicating that someone had died.\nDuring the pandemic, Ostberg was a youth worker at the Boys and Girls Club of Thunder Bay.\n“She worked with the Algonquin [Avenue Public School] cohort,” said Albert Aiello, the organization's executive director, explaining that students were separated by school to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\nHe called Ostberg a good role model who was liked by everyone who met her.\n“The kids really gravitated to her and you could tell she was a natural with kids,” said Aiello, who is also the councillor for the McIntyre ward.\n“When she would come in, members would run up to her and want to be doing whatever activity she would do.\"\nThis is the same\nincident that the TBPS is being investigated for by the Special Investigations Unit.\nOn Friday, the president of the Thunder Bay Police Association issued a\nstatement regarding the current SIU investigation into the death of Jenna Ostberg.\n“The Thunder Bay Police Association is sad to hear about a death in our community. Our hearts go out to the loved ones and those impacted by this tragic death,” Colin Woods said.\n“From what we understand, details that show a clearer picture of what happened are being withheld while the investigation is ongoing and will be released with time.”\nAlso on Friday, Confederation College lowered its flag to half-mast in memory of Ostberg, who was a recent graduate from the College Access Program.\n\"Her passing comes as a shock to all of us in the Confederation College community and beyond,\" the\nmessage said, offering contact information for anyone needing support services during this difficult time.\n\"Jenna's presence will be dearly missed, and we extend our deepest sympathies to all who knew and loved her.\"",
