  "text": "Skiers and snowboarders enjoy first snow of the season EXETER, R.I. (WLNE) — Skiers and snowboarders couldn’t wait to take to the slopes Sunday [despite the winter storm.](https://www.abc6.com/round-2-of-snow-will-taper-this-evening-icy-roads-remain-a-big-concern/) “I personally love snow,” Gabrielle Beaulie of West Warwick said. “It is one of my favorite parts about living in Rhode Island. I am super excited. It makes me really happy that it is snowing right now.” A full day of snowy conditions caused Yawgoo Valley ski area to draw in the crowds. “Honestly the weather is bringing in more people who would not normally ski today,” Operations Manager Danielle D’Andrea said. “The snow gets everyone excited and gets them thinking about us.” For some, today’s weather made it the perfect day to learn the slopes. “I am hoping it is the perfect conditions to learn how to ski, it looks pretty good out there,” Beaulie said. “I just hope it is not too slushy or too icy, hoping for no injuries.” For others, the drive to the ski area was not the easiest, but it was well worth it. “It was a little rough this morning but we are here and now we are going to have fun,” Layne Trimarchi of Providence said.",
