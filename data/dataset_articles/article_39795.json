  "text": "AUSTRALIAN LAMB CONQUERS THE GENERATION GAP IN LATEST SUMMER CAMPAIGN VIA THE MONKEYS [No Comments](#comments)\nAustralian Lamb is back. This year, the hotly anticipated summer campaign is skewering the generation gap that continues to divide the nation.\nCreated by The Monkeys, part of Accenture Song, and co-directed by Aimée-Lee Xu Hsien and Trent O’Donnell – a Millennial and Gen X-er, respectively – the film imagines a world in which the generations have been separated by The Generation Gap: an impassable chasm that keeps each age group away from the others.\nLeft to their own devices, each generation has become the worst version of themselves – until a lamb BBQ appears to remind Australians of all ages that, actually, we have more in common than divides us.\nThe full-length ad premieres during the evening news of Seven and Nine today (7th January), followed by a rollout across free to air and subscription TV nationally. It will be pushed out across TV, online video, catch up TV, paid social and retail OOH channels by UM, with One Green Bean driving reach for the campaign across earned media and owned social.\nFor the first time, One Green Bean will also amplify the campaign via a social-first content piece launching across owned and influencer marketing channels from 15th January. The campaign will also be supported through key retail and butcher channel activation and integration.\nSays Graeme Yardy, Domestic Market Manager at Meat and Livestock Australia: “Pop culture would have us believe that the generations are practically different species. Apparently, Boomers are unable to master the basics of technology whilst Zoomers spend every waking moment making TikTok dances and Millennials spend too much on avo toast and craft beer.\n“But in reality, there’s far more that unites than separates us, and that’s what this year’s Summer Lamb campaign is all about. Whether it’s a love of our sporting heroes or our beautiful landscapes, the best of Australia always brings us together, and what better way to break down the generational divide than over an epic Aussie lamb BBQ – the ultimate unifier!”\nAdds Scott Dettrick, Creative Director at The Monkeys: “With growing differences in wealth, opinions, and ways of communication, the generation gap in Australia has never been wider. The various frustrations this year have each generation throwing tropes around, looking for someone to blame. When you scratch beneath the surface though, it’s attitudes, not age, that divide us.\n“Maybe if we just got around a lamb BBQ and had a chat, we might find out that grandad is actually pretty cool, or all that stuff millennials know can be really useful. Our entire creative process this year was a fun generational debate, and with multi-generational directors and editors on the films, it was all very method.”\nCreative Agency – The Monkeys, part of Accenture Song\nChief Creative Officer: Tara Ford\nCreative Director: Scott Dettrick\nCreative Team: Jake Ausburn & Alex Polglase\nHead of Production: Penny Brown\nSenior Producer: Elliot Liebermann\nProduction Coordinator: Emily Coleman\nThe Monkeys Group CEO and Co-Founder & Accenture Song ANZ President: Mark Green\nManaging Director: Matt Michael\nBusiness Strategy Director: Kit Lansdell\nHead of Business Management: Topher Jones\nSenior Business Manager: Celine Dinant\nBusiness Executive: Matt Stafford\nProduction Company: Rabbit\nDirectors: Aimée-Lee Xu Hsien & Trent O’Donnell\nMD/Partner/Executive Producer: Alex Hay\nPartner/Executive Producer: Lucas Jenner\nProducer: Morgan Hind\nDoP: Emma Paine\nProduction Design: Virginia Mesiti\nCasting: Citizen Jane Casting\nPost-Production: The Editors\nEdit House: The Editors\nEditors: Grace O’Connell & Stu Morley\nExecutive Producer: Rita Gagliardi\nLead Flame Artist: Stu Cadzow\nVFX Supervisor: Andreas Wanda\nColourist: Greg ‘Elvis’ Constanaras\nMusic & Sound: MassiveMusic\nComposer: Haydn Walker\nSound Designer: Simon Kane\nProducer: Katrina Aquilia\nMedia Agency – UM\nClient Partner: Lauren Thornborough\nSenior Creative Connections Planner: Cayley McArthur\nSenior Planning Manager: Bernadette Banasik\nSenior Partnerships Trader: Joshua Coles\nTrader: Jess Curran\nPR and Social Agency – One Green Bean\nHead of Creative Innovation: Hannah Stalder\nHead of Content: Laura Byrne\nAccount Director, PR: Molly Dodwell\nAccount Director, Social: Amy McCann\nSenior Content Creative: Jack Williams\nContent Creative: Gabi Kearney\nSenior Account Executive: Bridget Patterson\nClient – Meat & Livestock Australia\nGeneral Manager – Marketing and Insights: Nathan Low\nDomestic Market Manager: Graeme Yardy\nBrand Manager: Derek Lau",
