  "text": "The Cleveland Browns strike again against the Cincinnati Bengals. More specifically, quarterback Jeff Driskel and wide receiver David Bell have connected for their second touchdown strike in this game.\nPadding his stats in garbage time, Driskell is now up to 168 yards and two touchdowns on 13-of-26 passing. He also has the two interceptions to his name.\nBell is now up to 68 yards and two touchdowns on four catches for the Browns today. This is a career-high for the second-year receiver out of Purdue.\nWhile the Browns trail in this game by a score of 14-31, it remains refreshing to see that even their second and third-stringers are going to play for a full 60 minutes when given the chance.\nMore importantly, the Browns already have their playoff spot locked down while the Bengals will clean out their lockers in the morning. The Browns will play the Houston Texans in the first round of the playoffs.\n. @DB3LL rises up between defenders and muscles his way into the end zone 💪 #CLEvsCIN on CBS & NFL+ pic.twitter.com/JZTFW6uKzZ\n— Cleveland Browns (@Browns) January 7, 2024\nMore Videos Browns rookie Isaiah McGuire gets his first career sack vs. Bengals Browns get garbage time touchdown as Jeff Driskel finds David Bell deep vs. Bengals D'Anthony Bell not resting, gets second pick as a Brown vs. Bengals Browns join '87 Patriots to start 5 different QBs in a season WATCH: Joe Flacco mic'd up for playoff clinching win over the Jets on Thursday Night",
