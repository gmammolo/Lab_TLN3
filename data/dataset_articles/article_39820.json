  "text": "Will continue to provide aid to Myanmar refugees: Mizoram CM Lalduhoma\nMizoram chief minister Lalduhoma has said his government would continue providing assistance to refugees from Myanmar and internally displaced people from Manipur, with support from the Centre.\nLalduhoma made the comments at a press conference here on Saturday upon his return from Delhi.”Even though the Centre can’t accord refugee status to the Myanmar nationals, it is ready to collaborate with us in providing relief to them. People from Manipur, who fled their homes due to ethnic violence, will also be looked after with the help of the central government,” he said.\nAccording to officials, more than 31,000 individuals belonging to the Chin community from Myanmar have sought shelter in Mizoram since February 2021, following a military coup in their home country. agencies\nFor more news like this visit TOI.
