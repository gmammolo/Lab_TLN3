  "text": "David Bell grabs 2 TDs in 4th quarter for late offensive spark in Browns loss to Bengals\nDavid Bell grabs 2 TDs in 4th quarter for late offensive spark in Browns loss to Bengals\nHeading into Week 18, the Browns had already secured a playoff spot and decided to rest their starters, giving a chance for their backups and younger players to gain valuable game experience. Despite the loss, this game does not affect their postseason.\nStruggles for the Young Players and Backups\nWith the younger players and backups getting a chance to play, the Browns struggled both offensively and defensively. The defense gave up 31 points, and the offense couldn’t find a rhythm in the passing or running game.\nLooking Ahead to the Playoffs\nDespite the loss, the Browns are not worried as they prepare for their playoff matchup. Their starters will be back on the field, and they will face the Texans in the Wild Card round of the playoffs.\nThe Browns will officially face the AFC South-winning Texans in the Wild Card round of the playoffs.",
