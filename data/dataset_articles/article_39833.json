  "text": "John Carlson scored with 52.9 seconds remaining in regulation as the host Washington Capitals edged the Los Angeles Kings 4-3 on Sunday.\nCarlson's point shot got past Cam Talbot for his third of the season. Nicolas Aube-Kubel scored a goal and added two assists, while Nic Dowd had a goal and one helper for Washington.\nDylan Strome had the other Capitals goal, and Darcy Kuemper made 38 saves as Washington avoided a third straight loss.\nWith the victory, the Capitals swept the season series against the Kings. Washington won the only other matchup between the two clubs, 2-1 on Nov. 29. Washington improved to 8-2-0 against Los Angeles since the 2018-19 season.\nKevin Fiala scored twice for Los Angeles, and Adrian Kempe had the other for the Kings, who have lost a season-high five straight games. Talbot stopped 30 shots in the loss.\nFiala gave Los Angeles a 3-2 lead on a power play with a backhand shot past Kuemper for his 10th of the season at 1:01 of the third period.\nWashington tied it 3-3 at 8:36 of the third when Aube-Kubel beat a screened Talbot blocker-side for his fourth of the season.\nThe teams were tied 2-2 after two periods.\nWashington opened the scoring at 4:22 of the middle period when Dowd beat Talbot with a backhand shot for his sixth of the season. The center has points in four of his last five games.\nKempe tied the game 1-1 on a power play, one-timing Drew Doughty's feed. It appeared to redirect off Capitals defenseman Martin Fehervary and past Kuemper at 7:12 of the second period for Kempe's 15th of the season.\nThe Kings took their first lead of the afternoon when Fiala put home the rebound of Phillip Danault's shot at 13:02 of the second.\nStrome tied it 2-2 at 15:35, completing a 2-on-0 give-and-go with Alex Ovechkin for his team-leading 15th of the season. Ovechkin, a game-time decision, now has points in five straight.\nWith the secondary assist, Max Pacioretty picked up his first point of the season.\n--Field Level Media",
