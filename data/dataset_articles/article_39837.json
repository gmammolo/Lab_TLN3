She starts the video by saying, “Did you know kids talk about anxiety in a whole heck of a bunch of different ways that parents often don’t pick up on? Here are 15 different ways that kids say, ‘I’m feeling worried.'”\nThe first one is something I’m sure every parent has heard. You might have even heard it today—”My tummy hurts.”\nYes, kids complain about tummy aches all of the time. Especially if you’ve got a picky eater on your hands that’s trying to wriggle themselves out of dinner!
