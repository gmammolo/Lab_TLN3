  "text": "Optimism is an admirable quality, and one I try to master. In this business, we see and hear about horrific deeds every day — tragedies that make the mundane frustrations of daily life seem pretty mild. But winter is different. As the temperature drops and continues to hover in, around or below the freeze zone, my attitude takes a nose dive.\nIt’s not that my glass of water is half-empty, it’s frozen. And spring is a long time to wait for the thaw.\nWhen winter arrived in full force earlier this week, I knew this season was going to be a bad one. In truth, we have become a little spoiled. While we may have had a heavy snowstorm or two on occasions these past years, recent winters certainly have not been like the ones many of us remember from our youth.\nIn those days, snow and cold temps would arrive in November and stick around long after the official day of spring had passed on the calendar. I can recall winters when we would go months without seeing grass or ground due to the continued snow.\nOne of the worst winter seasons I can recall occurred when I was a fairly young child. We lived in the house where my husband and I now reside — the family homeplace. Fortunately, it’s a fairly large place, because growing up my parents, grandparents and we five kids all lived there. On this particular year, many of my father’s family members planned to come in from Baltimore and spend Thanksgiving with us. The total guest list: my other grandmother, two of my father’s brothers and their wives, and their five kids.\nThat’s right, during this Thanksgiving weekend our house would be home to 10 kids — ranging in age from babies to teens — and nine adults. Although I can now imagine the stress my mother felt preparing for such a house full of guests, we were excited. It wasn’t often that we got to spend time with Dad’s branch of the family.\nLittle did we know we would be spending much more time with them than originally anticipated.\nLess than a day or two after our relatives arrived, the snowstorm blew in with a vengeance. It seems like the snow total was well over a foot — and maybe more. In those days, we did not have four-wheel-drive vehicles, and so we were stranded — all 19 of us.\nIn the evenings, I remember our entire first floor was covered with sleeping bags and pallets of blankets and bedding for the kids. Each morning, the adults would bundle us all up in layers upon layers of clothes and coats.\nWhen lost gloves and mittens became a problem, they would cover our hands with two to three pairs of heavy socks and tape them snugly around the wrists. Then, we were politely nudged out the door to make snowmen, snow angels, throw snowballs and basically engage in any activity that wasn’t dangerous, but kept us outdoors so we wouldn’t drive the adults crazy.\nIt was a week before the snow melted enough for our visitors to head back to Baltimore. We kids were a little disappointed — the adventure was over. Mom, I imagine, enjoyed a well-deserved break.\nI’ve thought about that winter quite a bit this year. Our house is much quieter now, with just me, the husband and two German shepherds. But I realize we tend to have much less endurance of winter weather than we did back in the day.\nMy dogs, having grown up with me and my cold intolerance, can’t stand the slightest cool breeze, much less a minus 32-degree day. Occasionally, they will play in the snow, but it’s usually a quick romp followed by hours spent in their warm beds. Sometimes, I catch them curled up near a heater.\nI’ve thought about getting them sweaters, but we tried that once years ago with less-than-favorable results.\nIt was also Christmas, and at the time we had a Neapolitan mastiff puppy.\nIf you’re not familiar with the breed, think of a grumpy drooler, of giant size, with loads of extra skin around the neck and face. I bought him the cutest doggie sweater imaginable from Gap. It was red and green, and featured an array of adorable, iconic reindeer.\nSo winter has just started, and I’ve already come to the realization I probably won’t be warm again until late March or April.\nThe sight of snow is now completely depressing, the cold temperatures have me longing for a vacation to a desert (any desert, on any continent) and my daily travels on Route 52 through snowstorms have started to leave me with the adventurous feeling of bungee jumping — without the cord.\nI’ve tried telling myself that the beauty of our other three seasons more than makes up for the inconveniences of winter, but it’s a hard sale. I’m in serious need of some tulips and a week of 80-degree days.\nI suppose it could be worse. The husband and I do have four-wheel-drive vehicles, and we don’t have 17 house guests — or a grumpy Neapolitan mastiff dressed in a reindeer sweater.\nIn times like this we have to find comfort in the small things. Maybe the glass is beginning to thaw after all.",
