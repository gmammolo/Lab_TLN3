  "text": "Young children have a surprising capacity to learn math from their surroundings. It doesn’t take much, and they hear and use math language all the time without realizing it. When they ask for snacks, they use size comparisons, “big” and “little,” or when they count the number of kitchen utensils needed for a family meal, they are developing foundational math concepts that anchor their thinking for future learning. These casual and playful routine math opportunities are everywhere and free; all we have to do is to recognize and share them with children. When children are babies and toddlers, parents and early childhood educators think about the best ways to provide them with a head start in life and in school. Often, the emphasis to date has been on reading, with less consideration given to math. Yet early math is an integral part of the complex web of learning that includes language, movement and social interactions that support children’s natural instincts to collect and organize information.",
