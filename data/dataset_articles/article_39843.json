  "text": "Jordan Hooper wiped a tear from her cheek. The Nebraska basketball legend from Alliance gazed up from the court and Pinnacle Bank Arena toward the venue’s north wall. For years, there had been seven jerseys hanging there. On the left, there’s Stu Lantz’s No. 22, Dave Hoppen’s No. 42, Eric Piatkowski’s No. 52 and Tyronn Lue’s No. 10 for the men. On the right, there’s Maurtice Ivy’s No. 30, Karen Jennings’ No. 51 and Kelsey Griffin’s No. 23. On Sunday, Hooper’s No. 35 took its rightful place alongside them, becoming the eighth jersey to be retired between the men’s and women’s programs. Leading up to the ceremony, Hooper hoped she wasn’t going to cry, but she knew deep down that she probably would. For Hooper, this had been a long time coming. She’d known since Nov. 17 that Nebraska would be retiring her jersey. And in the nights leading up to the ceremony, the anticipation of the moment kept her up at night. “Sometimes at night I think about it and I can’t sleep because I’m sweating and my heart’s pounding and I might throw up,” Hooper told the Journal Star earlier this week. “I’m not gonna throw up, but that’s how it feels. I’ve always been like this leading up to something big. It’s not stress, but it is, if that makes sense. It’s just an excitement that I can’t get past until I’ve done it.” Hooper’s resume speaks for itself. First-team All-American. A finalist for both the Wade Trophy and the Wooden Award. Big Ten Player of the Year. A three-time first-team All-Big Ten forward. No. 2 in program history in points scored with 2,357. No. 3 in program history in rebounds with 1,110. No. 1 in program history in three-pointers made and attempted. No. 4 in program history in made free throws. No. 7 in program history in games played. Tied for No. 1, alongside Kelsey Griffin, in school history with 40 career double-doubles. There was no denying that Hooper’s jersey would be retired. The steps — finding out the right time, getting approval from head coach Amy Williams and getting approval from Nebraska Athletics’ senior executive staff — felt like formalities ahead of the inevitable. So when Hooper decided to take a year off from playing professional basketball, Nebraska women’s basketball sports information director and Husker Radio Network in-game analyst Jeff Griesch got the ball rolling. Hooper was hanging Christmas lights at her place in Alliance when Williams surprised her with the news. “When she called, I just had a lot of emotions,” Hooper said. “There was a little bit of disbelief, but also, I was hoping this would happen, so when they called and told me, I don’t know what the right reaction is, but my reaction was to cuss and cry.” It’s hard to believe it’s been 10 years since Hooper last laced up her sneakers and donned the Nebraska scarlet. But then you think about everything she’s accomplished since then. The No. 13 pick in the WNBA draft. Having played for the Tulsa Shock/Dallas Wings, Connecticut Sun, Atlanta Dream and Chicago Sky, while also having played internationally in Turkey, Australia, Belarus and Israel. Last season, she played for Hapoel Rishon Le-Zion in Israel, averaging 13.4 points and 8.6 rebounds per game. But she almost walked away before that season. “I had made the decision honestly two years ago that I wasn’t going back overseas,” Hooper said. “And then I got a pretty decent — decent is a very generous statement — but I got a pretty decent offer.” But it came with a caveat. The coach, Ziv Erez, was known for being tough to play for. “So I was like, ‘Yeah. I think I can prove to him that I can play for him,’” Hooper said. Despite playing well on the floor and being the only player on the team older than 30 and one of just two players older than 25, Hooper’s mental health hit a low. She wasn’t having as much fun anymore. “I was like, I don’t think I can do this again,’” Hooper said. “‘This is a lot on my mental, physical, emotional — everything is just constant.’ Especially when you’re playing for somebody that expects you to be 25 years old. I’m just not.” She is quick to point out that she is not retired. She’s on a break, spending a year back home in Alliance to refocus and assess her future, both in basketball and beyond the sport she’s played for decades. As far as her future in basketball, Hooper said, “I like it then I’ll be retired and I’ll be done. But if I feel like I still have something left to give the game and give it well, and not be half-assing it, then I’ll do it.” As far as beyond basketball, she’s still figuring that out — a concept that is notoriously difficult for athletes who are getting ready to adjust to the after. “I’ve been focused on one thing since I was a third grader: to play sports at the next level,” Hooper said. “And then next level. And the next level. Now that I’ve been at all the levels, I don’t know what the hell to do.” (Writer’s Note: It feels important to note that Hooper laughed after that quote). For work, she’s been washing windows when the weather’s been nice. She’s also watched people’s pets when they’ve been on vacation. For fun, she discovered cycling — having embarked on Bike Ride Across Nebraska on a mountain bike this summer despite not having ridden much beforehand. After cycling between 600 and 700 miles across the state, Hooper said the experience was “hard, but one of the best experiences I’ve ever done. “Honestly, I think anybody could do it if they wanted to. It was awesome. I’m going to try to do it again whenever I can.” Maybe it’s this summer. Maybe it’s next year. Maybe it’s several years from now. Hooper’s got a lot to think about moving forward. “That’s my biggest thing that I’m trying to figure out by being home for an entire year is, Do I like it? Do I not like it? Do I want to play again? Do I not? That’s what I’m trying to figure out right now,” Hooper said. “I don’t really have a career. I’m just kind of floating from thing to thing and trying to figure out my life. So far, still a work in progress.” She may consider herself a work in progress, but nothing will undo what she has accomplished thus far. She’s Jordan Hooper. All-American player. All-American person. Whatever she sets her mind to moving forward, there’s no doubt she’s going to be successful in it.",
