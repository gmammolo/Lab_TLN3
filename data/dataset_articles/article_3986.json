We will continue to raise awareness of the issues many face, and make sure that no other family has to go through this.”\nThe handbag appeal started as a practical way for the relatives to try to deal with their grief as “it was very cathartic and allows us to talk about Grace”, Ms O’Callaghan said.\nShe added: “We had no idea how our initiative would take off. It helped that Grace loved a handbag.\n“Detective Inspector Scott Beard (who was part of the murder investigation team) said that each bag was a smile on the face of someone who needs it, so how lovely to think that 16,000 people have smiled because of Grace.\n“We are so proud of the legacy we have created in her memory.”\nThe next step is to try to get charity status for Love Grace, which started with a 50 bag target and is now at 16,000 bags worldwide.\nMs O’Callaghan said: “This will allow us to reach more areas and help offer practical empowerment to more women who need it.\n“Logistics is a key area for development, we rely on volunteers to set up and run appeals and then give back to refuge charities in their local areas. Hopefully we will be able to get our bags further afield.”\nSince Grace was murdered both women have also been fundraising for the White Ribbon charity to help raise awareness of male violence towards women.\nThe body of Ms Millane, who had been on her gap year, was found buried in a suitcase in Waitakere Ranges, a forested area outside the city of Auckland.\nIn February 2020, Kempson was jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years, with the judge rejecting his argument that the pair had rough sex that went too far.\nHe was later found guilty of raping another British tourist, who he also met on Tinder, eight months before he killed Ms Millane.\nThe rape victim reportedly went to the police after recognising Kempson from media coverage of the death of Ms Millane.\nThe sex offender was also convicted in a separate trial, with a different victim, of threatening to kill, two charges of assault with a weapon, three assaults and two counts of sexual violation.",
