  "text": "When schoolchildren were asked to name a construction crane on the site of a new Mater hospital, little Leticia Salas had the perfect answer – Doctor Crane. The six-year-old's suggestion has now been chosen as the crane's official name after judges decided Leticia's was the best entry from around 300 students who took part in Mater's 'Name the Crane' competition. Dr Crane is supporting John Holland Queensland workers in the construction of Mater Private Hospital Springfield Stage 2 – a major expansion of Mater's existing hospital that will provide an extra 174 public beds for the community. Leticia, a student at Springfield's Good Shepherd Catholic Primary School, said she had a very good reason for choosing the name. \"The reason why I named it Dr Crane is because doctors help people – and the crane is helping build the hospital that will help people,\" she said. Mater Private Hospital Springfield Acting General Manager Billy Jovanovic said children at five Springfield primary schools had entered the 'Name the Crane' competition, as well as a colouring competition. \"Leticia's suggested name for our new crane really stood out and definitely made the judges smile,\" Ms Jovanovic said. \"I don't think there could be a better name for a hospital crane than Doctor Crane!\" A second crane at the new hospital has been named Galu – an Indigenous name for a crane bird – following a separate competition open to nearby Aveo residents and Mater staff. The winning suggestion was made by hospital staff members Shiny John and Nadia Wilson. Mater Hospital Springfield is being built through a partnership between the State Government and Mater and will deliver Springfield's first public emergency department, intensive care unit and comprehensive maternity and birthing services. The new hospital will employ more than 1000 people when it becomes operational in 2026.
