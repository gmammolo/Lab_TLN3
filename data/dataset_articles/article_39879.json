  "text": "Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum\nVice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum’s launch of the Dubai Social Agenda 33 for the decade until 2033 highlighting the theme of ‘Family: The Foundation of Our Nation’ is truly praiseworthy.\nSheikh Mohammed said: “As has become our custom to unveil promising national programmes and projects on the 4th of January of every year, today we announce the launch of the Dubai Social Agenda 33: our plan for the Dubai community over the next decade. Its theme is ‘Family: The Foundation of Our Nation’, and its budget is Dhs208 billion until 2033. Its target is our Emirati families in Dubai and all aspects of their lives, in terms of housing, quality of life, identity and values, social cohesion and healthcare, as well as equipping the new generation with future skills.”\nClearly, the overarching importance of the family stands out and how much attention the benevolent UAE leadership pays to it is very noteworthy. “We aim to double the number of Emirati families within a decade, provide residential neighbourhoods that offer the world’s highest standard of living and safeguard our young generation against negative ideas that threaten the stability of our families,” His Highness added.\n“The Dubai Social Agenda outlines clear objectives and programmes based on the allocated budget, and will be overseen by my sons Hamdan, Maktoum, Ahmed and their brothers who grew up as part of the larger Dubai family and will care about its wellbeing more than anyone else. “Our nation is not merely buildings and figures; it is made up of families and people. My message to everyone in charge is that our priority for the next stage is to protect, empower and support our families,” Sheikh Mohammed said.\nThe family is not just the cornerstone of society, it is also the foundation of the nation. Healthy stable families are the need of the hour. Family is also at the root of enterprise. The Ministry of Economy has launched a unified registry for family businesses, highlighting four new cabinet resolutions that will enhance the governance of family companies and support the competitiveness of the legislation governing the sector in the country.\nTwenty-seven years ago, all member-states of the United Nations (UN) at the 1993 General Assembly through resolution A/RES/47/237 voted that May 15 each year be observed as the “International Day of Families,” the official celebration of which began two years later or in 1995. Research studies have demonstrated that families gain more social-economic support from each and one another as there are shared expenditures and division of labour. While younger members are oriented and trained to do domestic chores apart from child and elder care, the working age are given more opportunities to earn a living and become responsible stewards leading to increased chances for going beyond the hand-to-mouth subsistence and better education among the younger generations and even those who want to go for further studies.\nEveryone knows the stellar role of the family. It has an image unlike any other social entity. The family plays a key role in the development of the society and the affection that ties the members of a family with the country and the world. Truly, tight-knit families form the basic unit of a tolerant society.\nInterestingly, there is also a family-friendy garden in the UAE. The Ajman Chamber garden is a 27,000-square metre family-friendly recreational destination that includes 20,000 seasonal flowers and thousands of flowering shrubs. It also should be highlighted that Her Highness Sheikha Fatima Bint Mubarak, President of the General Women’s Union, Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation, and Chairwoman of Motherhood and Childhood Supreme Council has set an example to the world in the goodness, unlimited giving and the sincere efforts to support the UAE families in all areas.",
