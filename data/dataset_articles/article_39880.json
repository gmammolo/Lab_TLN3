  "text": "> SALERNO, Jan 8 — A stoppage-time header by Dusan Vlahovic helped Juventus come from behind to grab a 2-1 win at Salernitana in Serie A yesterday after the hosts were reduced to 10 men early in the second half.\nThe win allowed Juventus to keep pace with leaders Inter Milan in the title race as they reached the halfway mark in the campaign in second spot in the standings on 46 points.\nThey are two points behind Inter, who beat lowly Verona 2-1 in a drama-filled clash on Saturday, and seven above third-placed AC Milan.\n“Let’s be realistic. We have the Inter team in front of us who are having an important championship,” coach Massimiliano Allegri told DAZN.\nAdvertisement “Winning in Salerno was important to maintain the distance from fifth place. We have a 14-point advantage, that means five games. That’s already a lot.”\nVlahovic echoed the coach’s comments, stressing that a top-four finish is currently Juventus’ main focus.\n“Our goal is to get into the Champions League,” Vlahovic said. “Let’s move forward game by game, then we’ll see.”\nAdvertisement Juventus missed out on the top-tier European competition this season having ended seventh last year after they were docked 10 points in May for the club’s transfer dealings.\nSalernitana midfielder Giulio Maggiore beat Juve goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny with an unstoppable shot from the edge of the box before the break but Samuel Iling-Junior equalised in the 65th minute and Vlahovic headed home the winner in the 91st.\nThe hosts were left with 10 men when Maggiore received his second booking for a tackle on Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot in the 53rd minute.\nSalernitana, who on Thursday were thrashed 6-1 at Juve in the Coppa Italia last 16 after opening the scoring in the first minute, had an early chance through Junior Sambia but Szczesny did well to keep out his low shot towards the near corner.\nHowever, Filippo Inzaghi’s side took the lead six minutes before halftime, and Juventus were poor in front of goal until Iling-Junior found the leveller, striking into the roof of the net from close range.\nBut 10-man Salernitana did not let Juve settle and Szczesny had to keep out a long-range effort from Domagoj Bradaric one minute later.\nThe Pole had a lucky escape moments later when Simeon Nwankwo struck just wide from close range.\nVlahovic, who set up Iling-Junior for the equaliser, scored the winner with a towering header from near the penalty spot, after a neat pass from defender Danilo.\nJuventus are unbeaten in their last 14 Serie A games, the longest ongoing unbeaten streak in the competition.\nThey next host 14th-placed Sassuolo on Jan. 16.\nSalernitana, who are bottom with 12 points from 19 games, visit champions Napoli on Saturday. — Reuters",
