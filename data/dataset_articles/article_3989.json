  "text": "The Court of Appeals of San Isidro acquitted Luciano Napolitano, son of the late rocker Pappo, who had been sentenced to 3 years and 8 months in prison for allegedly beating and threatening his ex-partner at their home in the Buenos Aires town of Benavídez. In addition, the Justice ordered his immediate release , so he will not have to continue under house arrest , a benefit to which he agreed last September.\nThe ruling was issued by the First Chamber of that Chamber, made up of judges Juan Eduardo Stepañiuc and Leonardo Gabriel Pitlevnik, who granted the appeal filed by the musician's defense lawyer, Roberto Casorla Yalet.\nIn the 15-page resolution, to which Télam had access, Judge Stepañiuc stated that \"there is currently no evidence that would allow us to reach the degree of certainty necessary to categorically affirm that Napolitano is guilty of the act for which he is accused.\"\n\"The defendant has categorically denied the fact, giving a diametrically imposed version to that of the victim and in turn this version is not in contradiction with the rest of the evidence,\" he added.\nFor his part, Judge Pitlevnik considered that \"the dissimilar versions \" of the events \"fit with both the version of Mrs. (Mariel) Oleiro and that of Mr. Napolitano, insofar as the conflict existed and that is not in question.\"\nLuciano Napolitano was acquitted in the case of gender violence against his ex-partner.\nIn this way, the chamber members decided to revoke the verdict, absolve Napolitano and order the immediate release of the musician , who had already been granted house arrest, who was wearing an electronic ankle bracelet at his mother's house .\nMeanwhile, judicial sources reported that the Attorney General's Office of San Isidro will appeal the recent ruling to the Buenos Aires Supreme Court.\nThe case against Pappo's son for gender-based violence Pappo's son had been sentenced on December 28, 2022 in the framework of an abbreviated trial, agreed with Tigre prosecutor Diego Callegari, to 3 years and 8 months in prison for two acts of gender violence against his then partner, Oleiro, 35.\nNapolitano was considered the author of the crimes of \"minor injuries aggravated by the bond and by mediating gender violence, threats, aggravated illegal deprivation of liberty and possession of a weapon of war\" and \"threats aggravated by the use of weapons\", both in real competition with each other.\nTen days earlier, the judge in Correctional 4 of San Isidro, Juan Facundo Ocampo, ordered \"to mitigate the measure of coercion\" and to allow the \" house arrest \" of the musician with the monitoring of an electronic bracelet, as a result of the \"state of health of the detainee\" - he suffers from COPD among other ailments - and because he needed better care than what was provided in prison. in which he had been detained for more than a year and a half . He was finally granted the benefit last September.\nThe event that led to his conviction occurred on the afternoon of May 24, 2021 , in the home that Pappo's son had shared for four years with his partner Oleiro, located at Jujuy 3452, in the town of Benavídez , Tigre district, in the north of the conurbation.\nAccording to the woman's complaint, it all started when she asked Napolitano for the keys to the truck to go buy food for her pets and he began to insult and physically assault her , all in front of two of the defendant's daughters, ages 7 and 13.\nThe complainant said that her partner grabbed her by the neck , that the aggression included punches and kicks , that he squeezed her eye , that he also doused her with alcohol, that in the courtyard of the house he tried to run her over with a Volkswagen Amarok truck and that he left her locked without being able to leave the property and with the only possibility of being in the barbecue until the next day when she managed to call 911 and was rescued by the police.\nThe weapon found in Luciano Napolitano's home.\nNapolitano was arrested on May 26 at dawn and a search was carried out in his home in which the loaded .38 revolver was seized , which he does not have a permit to possess or carry.\nExpanding on his statement, Oleiro denounced Napolitano for a previous episode, which occurred on November 21, 2020 at the home of the defendant's mother, at 1300 Juncal Street in Tigre, where the convicted man was currently serving his home stay. According to her, he smashed a picture over her head and then threatened to kill her by placing the .38 caliber revolver that was seized from her home to her head .\nWhen questioned, Napolitano gave a version totally opposite to that of his then-girlfriend, since he said that it was an argument between a couple, that she was the one who assaulted him , that the firearm that was in his house he inherited 15 years ago from his father and that the woman knew how to leave the property. something that was discredited in the case with the testimony of the police officers who assisted the victim.\nWith information from Télam.",
