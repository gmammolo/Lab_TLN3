  "text": "*(CNN) — Singer and star of “The Little Mermaid” [Halle Bailey](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/21/entertainment/halle-bailey-melissa-mccarthy-inspiration/index.html) is welcoming a new baby boy to be part of her world with her boyfriend, DDG. “Even though we’re a few days into the new year, the greatest thing that 2023 could have done for me, was bring me my son,” Bailey [wrote](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1yL3AfLrJj/?hl=en) on her Instagram page alongside a photo showcasing her newborn son’s hand wearing a gold bracelet with his name, “Halo,” engraved on it. “Welcome to the world my halo,” she wrote. “The world is desperate to know you.” Bailey’s boyfriend, rapper DDG, [posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1yN27gLJtY/?hl=en) the same photo on his Instagram on Saturday, writing, “my biggest blessing by far” and that he’s “never been so in love.” The couple, who have been [romantically linked](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/halle-bailey-and-ddgs-relationship-timeline-photos/) since 2022, had not confirmed they were expecting, making Saturday’s announcement a surprise to some. While they stayed mum on their expanding family, Bailey previously opened up about her blossoming relationship with DDG, telling British Vogue in a 2022 [interview](https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/halle-bailey-british-vogue-interview) that “experiencing deep love for the first time in my life is something I feel has opened a whole new world for me creatively.” “I like all of the scary feelings that come with that. I like the suspense, the not knowing what’s going to happen, and I feel like that’s what I’m supposed to be going through in womanhood,” she added. This is Bailey and DDG’s first child together.
