  "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Hundreds of pounds of Legos were donated to the [Jacksonville nonprofit ‘V for Victory’](https://youtu.be/7Pr-VZRgIIU?si=3gmJOP4cz737elnK) after thousands of dollars worth of the colorful bricks were stolen out of the nonprofit's warehouse just before the New Year. “I hope this gives them joy and brings them happiness in the tough time they’re going through,\" Ben Hoffmann, a cancer survivor, said. Diagnosed as a baby with a rare form of brain cancer, Hoffmann spent the first four years of his life battling the disease. It was during his treatment he found his love for Legos. “It takes your mind off what you’re going through and gives a distraction from everything and makes you happy during your hard time,\" Hoffmann said. Hoffmann donated sets from his personal collection, just some of the hundreds of pounds of Legos donated to the [V for Victory nonprofit.](https://vforvictory.org/) The colorful bricks will become free gifts for children battling cancer. “We have a lot of warriors who will come here straight from treatment and to see the look on children’s faces as they’re able to shop in a store by themselves, they don’t have to worry about being around other people if they’re in a vulnerable state, and they really get to just have those moments of normalcy for a few minutes and it’s really nice to see that for the families,\" Meredith Jespersen, a 'V for Victory’ volunteer, said The call for donations came after $45,000 worth of Legos were [stolen from the nonprofit's warehouse just before the new year.](/video/news/local/77-1ce234b9-f2dc-41d2-b3ea-4900b18e70ce) “I wanted to help and I felt really bad,\" Amy Pechacek, who donated cash to the nonprofit, said. \"My husband had cancer and I know how hard it is on families and people who do have cancer and especially children.” The Legos are more than just a toy. It’s a distraction for a child going through cancer treatment and a way for their family to connect during a difficult time. \"Something like this happens, and I think it’s great that people in the community come together and do something to give back as well and I just felt it was very important to do so, for the children,\" Kelly Groke, who donated, said.",
