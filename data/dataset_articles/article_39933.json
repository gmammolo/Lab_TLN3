I must of missed the reasons you guys went there for?\"\n\"Have you relocated here in the UK?\" another asked.\nThe family have been spending time in Europe for the past few months, and have travelled to a number of countries during that time.\nIt's not know how long they plan to stay overseas, but Jules previously lived in the UK for 14 years and thinks of it as a second home.\nDiscussing if the family's UK visit could one day be a more permanent one, Jules recently told\nOK! Magazine: \"I feel like I'm at home when I'm in England. We'd never say never and Ollie is at a great age to travel with.\"\nOllie is growing up so quickly!\nJules shared a cute mother-son moment on\nIn the most recent picture, both Jules and Ollie are wearing sunglasses.\n\"Yeah my kid is cool,\" she captioned the post.\n\"Pic 1 (left) taken today and pic 2 (right) taken 1 year ago in 2 weeks time!

We love you so much. You make out life even more sweet! My baby is 2!\"\nJules wrote.\nCam posted this adorable snap of Ollie, who was clearly living his best life and eating as much cake as possible.\n\"You can smash cupcakes anytime on your birthday mate!\"\nCam captioned the snap.\nHe also included a timestamp and it wasn't even 8:30am yet!\nThe birthday boy also had a visit from Cam's mum and enjoyed some special time with his Nonna.\nAfter some well deserved cake, the family of three jumped around on Ollie's brand new trampoline.\nThe trampoline also included a basketball hoop, so Cam had to teach his little mini-me how to shoot some hoops.\n\"Dad putting on a show for the birthday boy!\" Cam captioned on\nhis Instagram story.\nOllie seemed preoccupied, but Cam threw the ball behind his head and celebrated after making the shot.\nWhile the family celebrated Ollie's actual birthday day at home with quiet celebrations, Jules mentioned there's still a party to come!\nHe's not even two years old, but Jules and Cam's son Ollie is already doting after his mum.\nJules uploaded this\nadorable snap of Ollie trying to feed her with a bottle.\n\"He just wants to look after his mother 😂.

I swear he grew in three hours!\"\nshe captioned a series of pictures on Instagram.\n\"So cute, enjoy they grow so quickly,\" one follower commented.\nAnother wrote, \"So beautiful. Enjoy every second Jules, before you know it he'll be a man and you'll never get this time back.\"\n\"Those nights are long, hope you get some rest time today,\" wrote another fan.\nSince becoming a mum, Jules has shared plenty of raw and unfiltered moments with her followers and this is definitely one of them.\nShe's struggling with a broken arm, which she recently underwent surgery for and parenting with the injury has been a challenge, which she opened up about on Instagram.\n\"#realparenthood I tell you what… If this broken arm has any lesson… it's that I actually can live in pure dumpster. Not even an organised mess!\"\nshe captioned the post.\n\"This was a result of two extremely busy months, to then actually not physically being able to fix it up! I hate it, it's doing my head in. But he is happy, and loves playing in it and life goes on… my point is…The world won't end if your house isn't perfect… Will share in six weeks when I can physically sort my personal tornado made by me!\"\nJules' followers praised her in the comments for keeping it real.\nEven husband Cam commented, \"You have no idea how much this makes me happy. All will be ok hun I promise.\"\nCam and Jules are clearly loving every moment of being parents, but there's one thing Jules in particular is getting excited about.\nSharing a gorgeous family snap on Instagram, Jules feels like Ollie is finally starting to look like her.\n\"Potentially, just, maybe, see a hint, flicker, tinnyyyyy piece of me in Ollie here... Tiny,\"\nshe captioned the snap.\nHer followers loved the photo and had a lot of varying opinions on who Ollie really looks like.\n\"He is a beautiful combination of you both,\" wrote one follower.\nAnother commented, \"I noticed the other day that you are finally getting a look in.\"\n\"So funny... before I read your words... I was looking at Ollie... and thinking...where is his mum... all his dad sorry to say Jules lol,\" wrote another.\nWhile her followers may be divided on who Ollie looks like, one thing is for sure, they are a gorgeous little family!\nOllie is growing up fast and recently hit another big milestone!\nJules posted an adorable video of Ollie on her\nBaby Cub account as he played with a calendar at home and turns out he's learnt a new word.\n\"Ok mama and dada is there. But first OFFICIAL word is PUPPY! Think he is trying to tell us something,\"\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CdkTc4tPZN7/.\nIn the short clip a very excited Cam asked Oliver what the pictures are in the calendar, to which he replied \"Puppy!\".\nJules' followers flooded the post with comments, urging the couple to get a dog because clearly, Ollie wants one.\n\"Go on! You know you want one! He'd be happy with the pictures for a while!\" commented one follower.\nAnother wrote, \"Aww bless. I mean, you can't not get a puppy now.\"\nJules, Cam and Ollie recently returned from a luxurious family trip to Fiji — which was also the finale of her festival of 40 celebrations.\nWhile it was a fabulous holiday, these snaps from Jules look like it's well and truly back to reality now.\n\"Was feeling the holiday glow, then someone had a little accident and became bilingual. P.S he is fine now,\"\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CcsAcRFrtLK/.\nIn one image Ollie is flashing a cheeky grin to the camera while they snap a selfie. But she also posted a video, showing the stitches on his head covered by a bandage. Ollie is talking absolute gibberish, but clearly very happy about it.\n\"Awww this is the cutest thing I've seen in a while!\" commented one follower.\nAnother suggested that Ollie was just trying to speak Irish.\nBut Ollie's little bump on the head doesn't seem to be bothering him and they also enjoyed a family day out at The Wiggles concert.\n\"Fruit Salad Class of '22'🍏🍉🍓🍌Plenty of fun, so involved & loved it… Ollie did too…😂 Thanks for putting on a show @thewiggles Currently still humming in my head,\"\nCam captioned a series of posts from the day.\nJudging by these snaps, Cam and Jules may have had more fun than Ollie too.",
