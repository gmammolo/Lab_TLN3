  "text": "I love chocolate. Maybe you can relate? Sometimes, I find myself in the mood to bake something rich and chocolatey, but I don’t necessarily want an entire cake sitting around at my house (a dangerous situation for someone who is home as much as me, ha).\nThese chocolate baked donuts are the perfect treat. They are ultra rich but not necessarily overly sweet (check out my\nbaked cinnamon apple donuts if chocolate isn’t your thing).\nThe baked donuts are a spongey, moist cake and then they get topped with a chocolate glaze (and\nsprinkles if you’re fun). But, the recipe below only yields six baked donuts— a standard pan size. But, if you want to make a dozen, just double the recipe.\nI used\n“special dark” cocoa for the donuts photographed here, so they look especially dark. But any baking cocoa will do well for these chocolate baked donuts.\nMake sure to lightly butter or spray your pan before filling.\nYou could absolutely top these chocolate baked donuts with a different glaze or even nothing at all, and they are still a fun treat. Happy baking! xo.

In a smaller, separate bowl, stir together the wet ingredients: milk, oil, vinegar, and vanilla.\n- Stir the wet ingredients in with the dry until no lumps remain. Lightly butter or spray the donut baking pan before spooning the batter in.\n- Bake at 350°F for 14-15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the pan before turning out onto a cooling rack.\n- For the glaze, in a medium pot over medium heat, melt the butter and stir in the cream or milk, corn syrup, and vanilla. Add the chocolate chips, turning the heat down slightly if needed, and continue to cook and stir until the chips are melted.\n- Remove the pot from the heat and whisk in the powdered sugar. You may want to shift the sugar first, to remove any lumps, so your glaze will be lump-free.\n- Dip the donuts in the still-warm glaze, tapping off any extra. Then, top with sprinkles if using.\nNutrition\nNotice: Nutrition is auto-calculated, using Spoonacular, for your convenience. Where relevant, we recommend using your own nutrition calculations.",
