  "text": "Making the jump from prep school hockey to Division 1 college hockey has humbled many a player. But not Tewksbury native Sammy Taber, who’s piling up the points – and honors – during her freshman season on the Boston College women’s team. The 5-foot-5 forward leads the Eagles with 17 assists and 23 points. She was recently selected the Rookie of the Month by the Hockey Commissioners Association for her exploits in December. Taber, a member of the bronze medal-winning 2023 U.S. Under-18 Women’s National Team at the IIHF U-18 Women’s World Championships in Sweden, scored two goals and eight points in just three games for the 14th-ranked Eagles. Those eight points tied for the NCAA rookie lead in scoring in December and her plus-8 rating was the best out of any freshman in the country. Taber starred at Cushing Academy before enrolling at BC. Wrestling Lions second: Host Chelmsford captured second place at the Bruce Rich Invitational. The Lions (190) topped the field except for MVC rival Central Catholic (211.5), which had lost a dual meet to Chelmsford earlier in the week. Thomas Brown won the 285-pound title for CHS. Captain Jose Bethel was the runner-up at 190. Finishing fourth were Teddy Sheridan at 132 and Michael Korch at 144. Austin Hill took fifth at 138. Lowell goes 3-1: The Red Raiders impressed during a home quad meet in a performance highlighted by a 36-34 win over MVC rival Andover. Heavyweight Jaevion Rosado Cunningham secured the win over Andover with a pin for the Red Raiders (8-2, 4-0 MVC). Greater Lowell perfect: The Gryphons (11-2) went 4-0 with victories over Salem (40-39), Marlboro (42-33), Martha’s Vineyard (66-6) and Wilmington (45-21). Going 4-0 were Antoine Jackman at 106, Garrett Ayotte at 144 and Jorge Lora at 165. Picking up three wins were Navi Vongphoumy at 132 and Gabe Stickney 150/157. Clark takes fourth: Westford Academy senior Shane Clark earned fourth place at 190 at the Bruce Rich Invitational at Chelmsford High. Senior Leo Babineau grabbed fifth at 132 for the Ghosts. Taunton 51, Billerica 30: The Indians dropped the non-league dual meet despite several strong performances. Winning matches for Billerica were Shane Breen at 113 (pin), Peter Rincan at 120 (pin), David Hawkes at 132 (pin), Jackson Gearin at 138 (pin) and Jizaiah Candelario at 165 (pin). Girls hockey M/T 1, Billerica/Chelmsford 0: In a tense thriller, Sammy Ryan of Methuen/Tewksbury scored the game’s lone goal 14 seconds into the third period following a pass by Kat Schille. A goal by Billerica/Chelmsford off the stick of Ruby Boucher which would have tied the game was disallowed with 36 seconds left. Boys hockey Cambridge 6, Lowell 2: Senior Teddy Steinberg and sophomore Shane Peters each tallied a goal and an assist as visiting Lowell fell to Cambridge in a MVC/DCL conference game. Junior Nate Dodge added an assist for the Red Raiders. Weston 2, Littleton 1: Despite a 24-save performance from Charles Becker, Littleton was edged. Conor Glew tallied Littleton’s goal following passes from Liam Glew and Zachary Lizotte. Bedford 2, Dracut/Tyngsboro 0: Dracut/Tyngsboro couldn’t solve Bedford’s defense. Wilmington 0, Stoneham 0: The Middlesex League teams skated to a rare overtime tie with featured strong goaltending by both squads. For Wilmington, Tyler Marinho stopped 28 shots to collect his first varsity shutout. Central Catholic 6, Billerica 1: A balanced scoring attack led Central past Billerica. Scoring goals for the Raiders were Jake Morowski, Aiden Pinet, Brady Rickenbach, Adam Godfrey, Keegan Hunt and Ryan Melesky. Logan Sheedy made 16 saves for Central (2-5-1). Concord-Carlisle 5, Tewksbury 2: In a battle of area powers, Concord-Carlisle remained undefeated (8-0) with a win at Edge Sports in Bedford. Tewksbury (5-1) held a 33-18 shots advantage. Jeremy Insogna netted a goal and assist. Michael Connors also scored for the Redmen. Dishing out an assist each were Matthew Cooke and Tyler Bourgea. Owen Sovie made 13 saves between the pipes. NM 5, Groton-Dunstable 4: Brady Lavery scored 1:20 into overtime to lift North Middlesex to the thrilling victory at the Groton School. Sean Myers scored twice for NM (5-2), Max Caliri had a goal and assist, and Brady Dunbar set up the winning goal. For Groton-Dunstable (1-5), Mac Kahwati netted a hat trick and Griffin Southwick added the other tally. Girls track LHS excels: Lowell High soared in the Reggie Lewis Center at the MSTCA Freshman-Sophomore Championship, earning three individual medals. Freshman Kayla Moriarty posted a personal best of 28-4.5 on her last throw in the shot put to place fourth. Sophomore Ella Machado also finished fourth with a time of 5:31.00 in the mile. Rounding out the medalists for Lowell was sophomore Chasity Jennings, who placed sixth in the long jump with a leap of 15-5.75. McEleney wins: Groton-Dunstable’s Meghan McEleney won the girls 600-meter race in 1:41.22 at the MSTCA Freshman/Sophomore meet with a big personal best. CHS duo shines: Chelmsford teammates Kate Leonard and Mia McCusker finished second and eighth, respectively, in the MSTCA Freshman-Sophomore Championship. Leonard crossed in 5:24, while McCusker finished in 5:41. Boys swimming Westford 92, Concord-Carlisle 88: The Ghosts pulled out a thrilling Dual County League victory. Aiden Gouldson won the 200 free (1:51.10) and 100 backstroke (1:03.01), and was part of the winning medley relay (1:41.10) and 400 free relay (3:22.68) teams. Han Park captured the 200 IM for the Ghosts in 2:02.85, and Owen Curtin won the 50 free in 23.83. Park was also on the winning 400 free relay team. Girls swimming Concord-Carlisle 97, Westford 80: The Ghosts dropped the Dual County League meet despite victories from three swimmers. Capturing wins were Estella Cui in the 100 butterfly in 1:03.16, Catherine Newark in the 100 free in 57.07 and Sherry Ye in the 100 backstroke.",
