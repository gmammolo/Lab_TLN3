  "text": "OSAGE COUNTY, Okla. — A 10-year-old in Osage county is donating part of his pumpkin patch proceeds to a cancer center in Bartlesville. His family says after their own battles with cancer, it was important to him to do what he could to help. “That’s what it’s all about is giving back,” said Glenda Dick, grandmother. We first told you about 10-year-old Casey Dick back in October, when we visited his pumpkin patch in Osage County . Casey was working to raise money for rodeo competition costs and equipment for his horse. Since we shared his story, his family saw an overwhelming response of people wanting to buy pumpkins or make a donation. Casey was able to use the proceeds to pay for all of his rodeo costs, and barrel racing entry fees for both him and his 13-year-old sister, Bailey. “If you give with an open heart, it’s going to come back to you, and it really has,” Glenda said. “This pumpkin patch went from just a few, you know, he might have made close to $100 each year to making $1,000, so it came back to us already.” And with the money leftover, Casey and Bailey were able to make a donation to Hopestone Cancer Support Center of Bartlesville. “It was really good because we got to help some of the cancer stuff, and it just felt really good,” Casey said. Casey’s father was set to take over the family ranch when their grandparents retire, but tragically, the kids lost their dad to cancer about six years ago. Then, their grandpa had to retire due to his own fight with cancer. That’s when Casey decided to step up to keep the ranch going. Thankfully, their grandfather has successfully beat cancer, so the kids wanted to give $113 of their remaining pumpkin sales to the center as a thank you. “It felt good, and I was really happy about it because I like to help people,” Bailey said. “I’m sure you can tell, I am proud of my grandkids,” Glenda said. “I think they’re two of the best grandkids any grandmother can have.” The family plans to continue to raise money for the cancer center moving forward, and they hope to inspire others to do the same. “Hopefully it won’t be the last time they see my grandkids, and more donations hopefully are on the way,” Glenda said. Casey says he is planning to run his pumpkin patch again next fall, and he and his sister both plan to make it a tradition to always try to give back a portion of what they earn.",
