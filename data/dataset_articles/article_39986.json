  "text": "A Samoan-Kiwi artist has created a new-look Palestine flag to show off his support, as the war in Gaza continues into the new year.\nMichel Mulipola has been turning up to protests around Auckland with his redesigned Palestine flag, sporting Samoan patterns and motifs. It was also spotted amongst the crowd at Te Pāti Māori- organised nationwide protests last month .\nMulipola, a comic artist, said the fight for indigenous liberation and rights was the reason he brought the flag to that protest.\nThe protests were organised in response to the new coalition government policies around Te Tiriti o Waitangi, including the ACT Party’s bid to scrap the Māori Health Authority and Oranga Tamariki along with repealing the smokefree generation law.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. “For me, bringing the flag [was] because Māori are fighting for recognition,” he said.\n“This new government and the anti-Māori stance has kind of realised that the fight for freedom, the fight against oppression, isn’t over. None of us are free until all of us are free.”\nMulipola said of the unique flag: “It was designed because I kind of noticed that Samoans were quiet; especially online around the genocide happening in Palestine .\n“I decided to create a kind of image that would be symbolic of standing in solidarity with Palestine.”\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME.",
