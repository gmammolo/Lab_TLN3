Lyndsay Bell, who is the wife of Chiefs tight end Blake Bell , also joined them.\nIn the pictures, Swift stuns in a black mini dress and over-the-knee boots. Brittany Mahomes wore a black blouse, gray mini skirt and knee-high boots and Bell braved the chilly LA night in a white turtleneck sweater dress, leather jacket and black boots.\nTheir night out came ahead of the Golden Globe Awards and the Chiefs game against the Los Angeles Chargers on Jan. 7. Swift's concert film, \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,\" has been nominated for cinematic and box office achievement at the awards show. Variety has predicted that the \"Karma\" singer could walk away with the new honor, which was added to the ceremony this year to recognize a movie with \"extensive global audience support.\"\nIf Swift attends the Golden Globes at the Beverly Hilton in person, then she will likely have to miss the Chiefs-Chargers game, which kicks off at 4:25 p.m. ET, since the award show starts promptly at 8 p.m. ET. She has attended the last five Chiefs games to cheer for the team and her boyfriend Travis Kelce .\nTODAY.com has reached out to Kelce and Swift's representatives to see which LA event she will attend. But, it is possible Kelce won't take the field in the last regular season game as the Chiefs have already secured a playoff spot and multiple star players, like quarterback Patrick Mahomes, will not play against the Chargers.\nESPN reported Jan. 3 that Patrick Mahomes will rest and coach Andy Reid hinted that other players wouldn't enter the game either.\nSo, fans might not spot Swift seated next to Brittany Mahomes at the game or get another glimpse into their friendship like they have for the past few games.\nBrittany Mahomes last shared photos with the musician at a Chiefs game on Instagram Dec. 5.
