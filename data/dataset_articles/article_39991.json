  "text": "HOUSTON — One West Michigan high school football graduate is doing his part in helping the Wolverines prepare for the national championship game. [Battle Creek Lakeview High School](https://www.lakeviewspartans.org/) graduate [Joel Metzger](https://mgoblue.com/sports/football/roster/joel-metzger/24387) bleeds maize and blue. He's done so since he was in diapers, so playing at the Big House on Saturdays in the fall is a dream come true. However, the old dream was to be just like [Chase Winovich](https://mgoblue.com/sports/football/roster/chase-winovich/17074). Metzger grew out his hair during his freshman year of high school to look like the former [Michigan ](https://mgoblue.com/sports/football)star. While Metzger does not have the locks like Winovich now, he's still loving the ride with the Wolverines. \"Just being from Michigan, it means so much to me to be a part of the Michigan team,\" Metzger said. \"I grew up a Michigan fan. All of my buddies back home are Michigan fans and even the ones back home aren't, they might like State or go to State but they tell me they still root for us. It's awesome. It's awesome. There are so many so good dudes to be around. The coaches are great. They teach us a lot of lessons and obviously get to play some fun football.\" The coolest part about this game for Metzger is his grandfather Steve is taking the first flight of his life down from Michigan to be here for his grandson's big game. The 72-year-old was a tad nervous to go on an airplane to Texas, but he's doing well now that he is in Houston. ►Make it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this.
