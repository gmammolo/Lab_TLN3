  "text": "The Ellwood City Lincoln High boys basketball team got the job done Wednesday night.\nJoseph Roth scored 21 points to propel the Wolverines to a 40-37 WPIAL Class 3A consolation-round win over host Yough.\nEllwood City’s win locked up the seventh and final playoff berth out of the district for the upcoming PIAA playoffs. A loss would have ended the season for the Wolverines.\nEllwood City will play the District 6 champion on March 9 in the opening round of the PIAA playoffs.\nRoth now has 2,049 career points. He is one of seven county standouts to record over 2,000 points. Wilmington product Warren Sallade sits sixth on the all-time list at 2,075.\nEllwood City (17-9) was moments away from locking up a state playoff bid last week against top-seeded Deer Lakes and a spot in the WPIAL semifinals. However, the Wolverines let it get away in regulation and again in overtime, finally falling 39-38.\nEllwood City could have locked up a state playoff spot Saturday at home against Derry. However, the Trojans rolled to a 59-40 decision.\nYough’s season ends at 19-7.\nThe Wolverines led 12-6 after the first quarter and the teams were tied at 17 at the break. Ellwood City carried a 28-23 margin into the fourth quarter.\nAaron Lake contributed nine points for the Wolverines.\nTerek Crosby collected 21 points for the Cougars.",
