  "text": "'We stand with Israel and support their right to self defense in their fight against Hamas and remain committed to supporting them,' one lawmaker said. On the steps of the Historic Capitol Thursday morning, Florida lawmakers voiced their support for Israel and vowed to make the state the safest place for Jewish people in the United States. \"We stand with Israel and support their right to self defense in their fight against Hamas and remain committed to supporting them,\" said Sen. Ana Maria Rodriguez, R-Doral. \"It is horrific to think about the atrocities committed by Hamas on innocent civilians going about their daily lives,\" she added. \"All remaining hostages should be released unconditionally and be reunited with their families.\" Under an arch of blue and white balloons, senators and state representatives commemorated the first \"Israel Day at the Florida Capitol\" and committed to pass legislation that aids Israel during its war with Hamas that began with the Oct. 7 attacks. State officials have been nurturing closer ties to Israel in recent years. Gov. Ron DeSantis led two trade missions there, in 2019 and 2023. He also signed an executive order after the Oct. 7 attacks \"to carry out logistical, rescue and evacuation operations for Florida residents seeking transportation back to Florida and provide necessary law enforcement support for Jewish communities in Florida.\" After the attacks, Senate President Kathleen Passidomo and House Speaker Paul Renner issued a joint statement that said, in part, “Florida has a very special relationship with Israel. While we cherish the alliance between our governments, we also recognize the bonds of family and friendship that link so many Floridians to the Israeli people.\" So far this legislative session, both chambers have sponsored bills that would increase security at Jewish day schools , require the state to observe \"Holocaust Remembrance Day,\" and encourages government agencies to suspend contact and activities with the Council of American-Islamic Relations. On Thursday, the House passed a bill that would define antisemitism in Florida law with language developed by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance . Some worried the bill would have limited some First Amendment rights, but the House passed an amendment that clarified the term antisemitism \"does not include criticism of Israel that is similar to criticism of any other country.\" Also, it \"may not be construed to diminish or infringe upon any right protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or to conflict with federal or state antidiscrimination laws.\" Hate, discrimination on rise against Jewish people When Rep. Mike Gottlieb, D-Davie, closed on his bill – \"Antisemitism\" ( HB 187 ) – he said the definition has empowered governments to address the rise in hate and discrimination against Jewish people. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's hate crime statistics, over half of religious-based crimes are driven by anti-Jewish bias. Since the Hamas attacks inside Israel last October, the Anti-Defamation League reported a year later that incidents of antisemitic harassment, vandalism and assault increased by 388 percent over the same period the year before. Approximately 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas attacks, 240 people were taken hostage , and around 100 people are still hostages in Gaza, according to Israel . The Palestinian death toll in Gaza surpassed 30,000 on Thursday, according to Gaza's health ministry. Rep. Randy Fine, R-Palm Bay, urged the public to demand that law enforcement and state attorneys enforce the antisemitism bill when it becomes law. \"Whether we have antisemitism in our statutes one, five, or 100 times, it will not matter if we don't demand that we act on these laws as we pass them,\" Fine told the crowd. Recent special session focused on Israel Last November, lawmakers came to Tallahassee for a special session to pass legislation to show support for Israel and the state's Jewish communities — and to crack down on those who may be opposed to them. The legislature passed bills that would sanction businesses that work with Iranian companies and unanimously passed resolutions condemning the Hamas attacks and supporting the right of Israel to defend itself. Two survivors of the Hamas attack, as well as the Consul General of Israel in Miami Maor Elbaz-Starinsky were recognized in the House before the antisemitism bill was passed Thursday. \"I want to thank you because (your) actions are ... not just very important and heartwarming, but for me, it's actually a crucial part of my recovery process as I try to restore my faith in humanity,\" survivor Millet Ben Haim said.
