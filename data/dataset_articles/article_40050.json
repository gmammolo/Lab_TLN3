  "text": "The Baltimore Ravens drafted quarterback Lamar Jackson at No. 32 overall in the 2018 NFL draft. He has become one of the best signal callers in the league, and the belief from Baltimore to take a chance on him and give him the keys to their offense is one of the reasons why.\nThe Ravens did their due diligence while scouting Jackson and dove head first into trusting him as the next leader of their team. At the NFL Scouting Combine, head coach John Harbaugh was asked how quarterbacks are evaluated and said that the model for it has expanded, and he likes to think Baltimore was ahead of the curve.\n“That’s such a great question. To me, it’s just the way the game’s gone. We’ve expanded our view of what a quarterback is. It’s most obvious with Lamar [Jackson]. Obviously, would anybody said we made a bad decision when we drafted him back in 2018? But at the time, there were a lot of people saying that. I think the view has changed a lot in terms of how we view athletes or people in terms of their roles. The game has changed because of that. In the last six years, the way quarterbacks play … I think if you go back and look at football in 2015-17 or before that, there’s pretty much a model for that position. That model has definitely expanded tremendously. I would like to say we were a little ahead of the curve on that, but even we’re learning as we go when you watch guys play. You watch all these guys play. The way [Miami Dolphins QB] Tua [Tagovailoa] gets the ball out so fast – I mean, how can we incorporate some of that stuff into our offense? That’s just one example.”\nGone are the days of only pure pocket passers in the NFL. Jackson and plenty of other quarterbacks have introduced dual threats to the position and have changed the game forever in more good ways than imaginable.",
