The 68-year-old has produced some of the much-loved films of Bollywood, like Mr India, Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja, Judaai, Company, Wanted, and many more. Moreover, he debuted as an actor in the 2023 Luv Ranjan film, Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar, alongside Ranbir Kapoor, Shraddha Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia. Recently, the producer garnered attention for his hair transplant surgery. On February 29, 2024, Boney Kapoor made his first public appearance, days after his surgery. He was spotted in Jamnagar as he landed there to attend Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s pre-wedding festivities scheduled from March 1-3, 2024. The 68-year-old happily posed for the paps stationed outside the venue. He was seen wearing an all-grey outfit, comprising an oversized t-shirt and trousers paired with a multicolour shawl.

The producer was in a jolly mood as he happily obliged to their requests and did not shy away from showing his head to the camera. Boney’s freshly transplanted hair was visible in the videos from his latest appearance. Check out the video here . Just a week before arriving at Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s pre-wedding festivities, Boney had gone to Hyderabad for the inauguration of a hair transplant clinic. He underwent surgery for hair transformation in the same clinic. In a video shared by the clinic, the producer was seen sharing his experience of a hair transplant. He excitedly said: “Sarr mera dhak jaega, baalon se bhar jaega, baal ugenge, kya baat hai. Mera baal wapis aana Eugenix ke liye challenge hai. And I am sure they will do justice to it.” Don’t Miss: Mommy-To-Be, Deepika Padukone Gets Mobbed At Jamnagar Airport, Daddy-To-Be, Ranveer Protects Her Further in the video, Boney Kapoor shared his process of transformation with the viewers and revealed his experience. He said that so far things had been going quite nicely, and he is waiting for the end results. He said: “Abhi tak toh experience acha raha hai. Abhi dekhte hai yeh jo baal inhone lagaye hai mere sarr pe, kitna help karega mujhe ek better looking insaan banane mai.” Previously, in an interview with India Today, the producer-turned-actor had talked about his debut film. He shared that at first, he was very reluctant to do the film, Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar, but upon his children's and brother’s persuasion, he agreed to do it. Boney Kapoor said: “Initially, when Luv offered me the film, I was reluctant to do it. Thanks to my son, my daughters and my brother Sanjay Kapoor, they pushed me into it.” Do you see any changes in Boney Kapoor’s appearance post his hair transplant surgery? Let us know.
