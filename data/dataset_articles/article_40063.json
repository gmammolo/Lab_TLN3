  "text": "MARYVILLE, Tenn. — Don't call it a comeback. Rocky Williams, the owner of Maryville-based Rocky's Jamaica Sunrise, isn't cooking out of a storefront restaurant right now. But,\ncustomers are rallying around his family to bring back a Blount County favorite.\nRocky, along with his wife Cheryl Williams, brought the flavors of the Caribbean to Blount County in 2010. They've operated out of two brick-and-mortar locations during their tenure but had to shut down earlier this year.\nThey said the rising costs of doing business are to blame. Despite the rising costs, Rocky hasn't stopped working or cooking. He's setting his sights on a food truck and is working on raising $5,000 to get it on the road.\nRocky said a food truck doesn't have any overhead costs and customers are donating to a GoFundMe page started less than a month ago.\n\"Everybody wants me to set up at their parking lots when we get it,\" Rocky said. \" A lot of different places, doctor offices.\"\nRocky's food, like his jerk chicken, macaroni and cheese, red beans and rice and his well-known hot sauce will be served at the food truck. Since shuttering the brick-and-mortar location, Rocky and Cheryl have done a few catering orders for customers.\n\"I miss cooking for them,\" Rocky said, referring to his customers.\nThe supporters of Rocky's Jamaica Sunrise are what kept them in business for the past 14 years. The couple is touched by the support they've received in the past month.\n\"It means a lot because, I mean, a lot for them because they miss the food, you know, it is different from everybody else's food,\" Rocky said. \"Jamaican food, you can't get it anywhere in Maryville or Alcoa.\"\nRocky isn't one to sit still and has been working shifts at Rubbermaid over the past few weeks. Cheryl, a Maryville native, said the initial goal of their fundraiser is to raise $5,000. The money is a down payment on the food truck, which will take a few months to build.\n\"It shocked me to see how Blount County supported us,\" Cheryl said. \"I mean, I knew they would come out and thought they loved it. And they supported us, but when I saw (the GoFundMe), I was just, I was amazed.\"\nCheryl said people don't have to donate to the GoFundMe if they aren't able to. They can also show support by sharing\nsocial media posts about Rocky's Jamaica Sunrise. The Williams will give back to supporters, too.\n\"So once we get the food truck, the first day that we set up, we're going to give out free samples to everybody to give back for helping us to get the food truck,\" she said.",
