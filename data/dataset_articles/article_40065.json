The Nubian community leaders appreciated the opportunity to present their concerns and are optimistic about a positive resolution.\nIn a significant move towards inclusivity and support for minority communities, Speaker Anita Among assured the Nubian community leaders of Parliament's commitment to resolving their longstanding issues. During a meeting held on Thursday, 29 February 2024, Among emphasized the importance of submitting a formal petition through their area Member of Parliament, Hon Hassan Kirumira. This approach aims to ensure that the concerns are addressed comprehensively and systematically within the legislative framework.\nGovernment's Supportive Stance\nAdding to the Speaker's commitment, Government Chief Whip, Hon Hamson Obua, reiterated the government's readiness to support the Nubian community's efforts to address their issues.
