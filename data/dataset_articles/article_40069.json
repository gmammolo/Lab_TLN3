  "text": "PITMAN, New Jersey (WPVI) -- Action News Troubleshooters got help for a newlywed couple having problems with a charge for their honeymoon.\nDaniel DeGeorge and his new wife Amber went on their honeymoon as planned, so they were really surprised when they got home and realized the resort was claiming they had never been there, charging the couple for supposedly failing to show up.\nThe couple honeymooned at a Sandals Resort in Jamaica after tying the knot in October.\n\"Our reservation included a suite, so we had dedicated butler service,\" said DeGeorge.\nThe couple paid for the trip in full - nearly $13,000 - and says after checking in virtually, they had a fabulous time.\n\"One time we came back to our room and the guy had set up this beautiful thing in front of the tub. These beautiful lights and signs. Oh, I love my wife. It was awesome,\" said DeGeorge.\nMonths later, they were shocked to learn the resort was claiming the couple had never been there and as a result, was keeping their security deposit.\n\"They're claiming that we were a no show for our reservation and therefore they kept the $450 security deposit fee,\" said DeGeorge.\nHe says he contacted Sandals multiple times to get his deposit back, but to no avail. So, he contacted the Action News Troubleshooters.\n\"I said to myself I need to find something who's got a little bit more power than myself to try and get this resolved,\" he said.\nThe Troubleshooters got on it and finally the DeGeorges finally got their refund.\n\"On February 10th, I got confirmation that Sandals had finally returned the money,\" said DeGeorge.\nWe asked Sandals what happened in this case and the resort sent us a statement, saying in part: \"Customer satisfaction is a top priority at Sandals Resorts, and this was not the experience intended for the DeGeorges. We have looked into this, and it seems there was a small technical glitch that triggered this issue. It has since been corrected.\"\nWhen asked if he would like to thank the Troubleshooters, DeGeorge had this to say:\n\"I would like to thank them from the bottom of my heart, my wife, thanks you as well. I really I just would have been spinning my wheels and screaming into the wind without their help. And I just I can't thank them enough,\" he said.\nThis is a good reminder to always check your credit card and bank statements for erroneous charges.\nIf you have an issue you need the Troubleshooters' help resolving, you can reach out to our Call for Action hotline. The number is 1-866-978-4232. The hotline is open Monday through Friday from 11am until 1pm.\nYou can also reach out to us online at\n6abc.com/troubleshooters.\nFull Sandals Statement:\nThank you for bringing this to our attention. We always appreciate the opportunity to assist guests if their experience doesn't quite live up to expectations. Customer satisfaction is a top priority at Sandals Resorts, and this was not the experience intended for the DeGeorges.\nWe have looked into this, and it seems there was a small technical glitch that triggered this issue. It has since been corrected. We have gone ahead and started the refund process for the $450 and certainly apologize for this inconvenience. The credit should reflect on their account within 7 days.",
