  "text": "Tom Green's mum the real MVP in Canberra | 01:04 Ben Waterworth from Fox Sports @bjwaterworth March 1st, 2024 9:11 am\nStar Giants midfielder Tom Green is well placed to further elevate his game this season, according to assistant coach Ben Hart, after another standout summer display – and hours after his mum’s heroic hosting effort in Canberra.\nGreen played an integral role in the Giants’ surge deep into finals last year, making the All-Australian squad and polling 16 Brownlow votes during a career-best campaign.\nBut the 23-year-old appears primed in 2024 to further cement his spot among the AFL’s best midfielders.\nThe only place to watch every game of the AFL Pre-Season live is Fox Footy, available on your free trial today >\nGreen on Thursday night starred in his home city of Canberra, kicking one goal from 31 disposals, 14 contested possessions, nine score involvements, nine clearances and six inside 50s in the Giants’ convincing 44-point Community Series win over Gold Coast .\nThe Giants’ comprehensive victory came 24 hours after Green’s family hosted the club’s entire travelling party for dinner in Canberra for the second consecutive year.\nGWS Giants players Tom Green and Harvey Thomas during a school camp in Canberra. Picture: GWS Giants Source: Supplied\n“So a lot of credit to my mum and dad, especially my mum, but the last couple of years she’s had the whole group – the whole support staff, players – over for dinner,” Green told Fox Footy post-match.\n“Last year was about 80, this year it was a little bit easier with around 40 or 50.\n“She’s an absolute star, a fantastic cook and really enjoys it – and I hope the boys do too.”\nAsked what was on the menu, Green said: “A bit of everything to be honest: Lasagne, chicken, her speciality is a bit of beef wrapped in prosciutto and pesto – that was really nice. I hope the boys enjoyed it.”\nHart post-match gave the spread a big tick of approval.\n“Always good. The Green’s look after us, that’s for sure,” Hart told reporters with a smile.\nSuns pumped by strong Giants | 00:46\n“Tom loves coming back to Canberra and playing. I did hear we hit 5000 members in Canberra, which is unreal for us here.\n“We love coming here and if you can get fed by the Green’s every time, we’re pretty lucky.”\nHart said he’d seen Green’s leadership improve significantly over the summer.\n“He certainly has done that (improved his game) in his training, the way he’s now leading the team in there. I think he’s got a really strong handle on not only what makes him play well but what makes the team play well and voicing it a lot,” Hart said.\n“H’s a good ball-winning midfielder for us, but hopefully we’ll keep adding that little bit of spread. I think today he got out a bit and managed to hit the scoreboard, which is fantastic.\n“I think he’s set himself well up for the season.”",
