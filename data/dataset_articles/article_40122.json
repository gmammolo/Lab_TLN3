  "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE February 29, 2024\nContact: Jessica Felix Romero |\nSojourners and SojoAction Applaud Senate Re-Introduction of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act\nWashington, D.C. — In response to the introduction of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act in the Senate, Sojourners and SojoAction President Rev. Adam Russell Taylor said:\n“Sojourners and SojoAction applaud Senators Durbin (D-IL) and Warnock (D-GA) for reintroducing the\n John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act in the Senate. This bill is long overdue and desperately needed legislation to shore up the freedom to vote and protect our democracy. Protecting voting rights is not a partisan issue, it is the foundation of a healthy and legitimate democracy. The freedom to vote is not a given; it has been contested since our nation’s founding and must be fought for and defended, and constantly expanded. Twenty-first century voter suppression and election subversion are designed to deter and limit who votes and whether all votes are counted. There is no more urgent moral cause right now than protecting the right to vote—which benefits and impacts every other issue and justice cause, from maternal and child health to climate change and immigration.\nVoting is a core means of political expression on the part of citizens and demands fair and reliable democratic processes. Each election, we invite people of faith who believe in our vision of democracy to cast their votes according to their conscience. We are now inviting you to share in that vision by making democratic reforms that restore the voice and vote of all citizens in the United States—in essence, the soul of our nation. We share a collective prayer that Congress will be so moved to prioritize and pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement act so we can actualize our shared prosperity through people power.”\n###\nSojourners, a faith-inspired nonprofit, articulates the biblical call to social justice through its magazine and digital publication and convenes, equips, and mobilizes people to put their faith into action.",
