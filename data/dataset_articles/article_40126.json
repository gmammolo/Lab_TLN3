Despite softer market conditions, including the impact of the United Auto Workers strike, the company managed to report a net income of $20.2 million, a stark contrast to the net loss of $76.0 million in Q422. This turnaround is indicative of the company's resilience and ability to navigate market volatility.\nThe full year net sales amounted to $1.95 billion, with a net income of $112.7 million, showcasing the company's ability to maintain profitability over the longer term.
