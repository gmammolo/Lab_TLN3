  "text": "PALOS HEIGHTS, Ill. (Gray News) - Never in a million years did an Illinois woman think she would win an instant $1 million by playing a scratch-off.\nAn unidentified woman celebrated her birthday by winning a seven-figure lottery ticket. The ticket was purchased at a BP gas station at 12700 South Harlem Ave. in Palos Heights, according to WLS.\nWLS reported that the woman decided to stop at a gas station and buy a $25 Diamond Crossword 10X purple ticket. She said she selected that specific ticket because it was her favorite color.\n“When I scratched the ticket in my car, I kept seeing wins that were getting bigger and bigger,” she said, per the reports. “As I got to the end, I realized it was worth $1 million and I couldn’t believe it.”\nThe woman was so shocked she went back in to double-check.\n“I instantly started crying and my legs felt like noodles. I didn’t think I would be able to drive home,” she said.\nThe woman told lottery officials that the money will make a difference in her life. She said she and her husband work very hard and she wants to give her children opportunities that the world has to offer.\nThe store will receive $10,000 for selling the winning ticket.\nCopyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc.
