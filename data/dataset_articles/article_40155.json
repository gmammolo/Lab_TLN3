  "text": "Nigerian record label owner and musician Don Jazzy has urged entrepreneurs not to give up on their dreams and goals.\nSharing a video on Instagram, the music emperor said that it is imperative for entrepreneurs to work on their projects and implement their strategies, no matter how small.\nHe admitted that starting and maintaining a business is not easy. However, Don Jazzy believes the result is worth it.\n“Dear entrepreneurs, dream big, start small, but most importantly, get started. Know why you started and keep going, no matter how hard it is, trust me, there will be hard times. Might be a distraction but you see me, I mind my own business,” he wrote.\nDon Jazzy's comments come after Universal Music Group announced a majority investment in Nigeria-based Afrobeats powerhouse label Mavin Global (Mavin).\nThe deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close later this year.\nThe Mavin team in Nigeria will be supported by UMG's global network of labels and businesses.\nCurrently distributed internationally (except Africa) through Virgin Music Group with Rema, Mavin and its roster have already been integrated into UMG's unmatched network, which includes several signings on US labels, including Ayra. Republic Partnership for Star and Interscope for Lifesize Teddy.\nAccording to the announcement, Mavin will maintain autonomy over its strategy and future talent development. As part of the agreement, Founder and CEO Don Jazzy and COO Tega Oghenejobo will continue to lead the company.\nDisclaimer: The views, comments, opinions, contributions and statements made by readers and contributors on this forum do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\nSource: www.myjoyonline.com",
