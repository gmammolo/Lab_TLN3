  "text": "Popular Nigerian skit maker, Lord Lamba, has taken to social media to share heartwarming photos and videos of his daughter, Princess Keilah, confirming long-standing rumors of his paternity with former Big Brother Naija (BBNaija) housemate, Queen Atang. This revelation comes in the wake of Queen's engagement announcement, sparking widespread interest and discussion among fans and followers.\nSpeculation about the father of Queen Atang’s child swirled for months, especially after she announced her pregnancy in late 2022. However, both parties remained tight-lipped about the situation until recently.\nLord Lamba, whose real name is Promise Kelvin Anagbogu, chose a significant moment to share the first-ever photos and videos of Princess Keilah, coinciding closely with Queen's engagement news to One King David. The shared images included the child's international passport, which lists her full name as Princess Keilah Kelvin Anagbogu, leaving no room for doubt regarding her parentage.\nRise to Fame\nPromise Kelvin Anagbogu, better known by his stage name Lord Lamba, has carved a niche for himself in the Nigerian entertainment industry as a talented Instagram comedian and content creator.\nKnown for his humorous skits that often revolve around the theme of lying to escape or resolve difficult situations, Lamba has amassed a substantial following. His choice of stage name, which translates to \"Lord or Master of Lies,\" reflects the unique brand of comedy he brings to his audience. Beyond his comedic endeavors, Lamba has also made a mark with engaging advert campaigns, showcasing his versatility and influence in the digital space.",
