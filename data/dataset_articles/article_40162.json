  "text": "Woman says her Stanley cup saved her life from a stray bullet STEUBENVILLE, Ohio (Gray News/TMX) – A woman in Ohio claims her Stanley tumbler saved her from being hit by a stray bullet. A 22-year-old named Rachel posted about the Feb. 12 incident on TikTok, which has since gone viral. Rachel told TMX she and her fiancé David were inside their home in the city of Steubenville when they heard gunshots outside. She said they heard about seven or eight gunshots and then one “really loud bang” from a bullet that came through the wall of the house and ricocheted off her Stanley tumbler, which was sitting directly in front of her. After bouncing off the Stanley cup, the bullet changed direction and went through a bottle of perfume before landing on the kitchen floor, Rachel said. The couple said they hid until police officers arrived. Rachel’s [video on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@xo._ray/video/7334832760600726830) documents the path of the bullet, showing the hole through her wall, the mark on her Stanley cup where the bullet bounced off, and the hole in her perfume bottle. The video also shows the bullet on her kitchen floor. While some TikTok users questioned the authenticity of the claims, Rachel posted [a follow-up video ](https://www.tiktok.com/@xo._ray/video/7334935703710731562)showing police in her home, investigating the scene. Gray News has reached out to Steubenville police for comment. However, some fellow Stanley fans were not surprised to hear that their favorite cup was indestructible, even against a bullet. “Who needs body armor? Just grab your Stanley,” one TikTok user wrote. “I’m convinced Stanleys are immortal,” another wrote. Copyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved. TMX contributed to this report.",
