  "text": "The My Hero Academia manga is entering its final stretch, which means 2024 may well be the best—and last—year in the series’ history. That’s why we’ve constructed this guide covering when every new My Hero Academia chapter is coming out to help ensure you don’t miss a moment. When Do My Hero Academia Manga Chapters Come out? Explained As is the case with most Shonen Jump series, My Hero Academia chapters release in three key ways throughout any given week, so long as they don’t come out around a holiday break. Raws of the latest chapter typically hit the internet on Thursdays around 6 a.m. EST. These aren’t the best way to see the chapter in its entirety, but they do at least allow you to see some of the highlights of the chapter before it’s completely translated. Fan translations, meanwhile, usually come out on Fridays around 8 a.m. EST. These might include some translation errors, but you can rest assured that you’re reading the entire chapter. Finally, the official release and translation of chapters comes out on Sundays at 10 a.m. EST normally and at 11 a.m. EST during Daylight Savings Time via the [official Shonen Jump website and app](https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/my-hero-academia). Though this is the least timely way to read a chapter, it’s the version with the fewest translation errors and supports the series’ official release legally. It’s also worth noting that the series has been known to space out its releases based on the needs of its author Kohei Horikoshi. When this occurs, there could be an extra week or two between chapters, either because of Horikoshi’s health or the need for more time to fully illustrate the next part of the story. Every My Hero Academia Chapter Release Date, Listed Below you’ll find a table compiling every known chapter release date for 2024. Do be aware, however, that the Raws and fan translations are technically illegal and don’t support the official release. Check them out at your own discretion. |My Hero Academia Chapter #||Raws Release Date||Fan Translation Release Date||Official Release Date| |My Hero Academia 411||Out Now||Out Now||Jan. 5 @ 10 a.m. EST| |My Hero Academia 412||Jan. 17 around 6 a.m. EST||Jan. 19 around 8 a.m. EST||Jan. 21 @ 10 a.m. EST| |My Hero Academia 413||Jan. 24 around 6 a.m. EST||Jan. 26 around 8 a.m. EST||Jan. 28 @ 10 a.m. EST| |My Hero Academia 414||Feb. 14 around 6 a.m. EST||Feb. 16 around 8 a.m. EST||Feb. 18 @ 10 a.m. EST| |My Hero Academia 415||Feb. 22 around 6 a.m. EST||Feb. 23 around 8 a.m. EST||Feb. 25 @ 10 a.m. EST| |My Hero Academia 416||Mar. 7 around 6 a.m. EST||Mar. 8 around 8 a.m. EST||Mar. 10 @ 10 a.m. EST| |My Hero Academia 417||Mar. 14 around 6 a.m. EST||Mar. 15 around 8 a.m. EST||Mar. 17 @ 11 a.m. EST| |My Hero Academia 418||TBA||TBA||TBA| My Hero Academia Chapter 417 Release Date and Spoilers With all that out of the way, you might now want to know if there are any My Hero Academia Chapter 417 spoilers prior to its official Mar. 10 release date. Though it’s still too early for any viable Raws to be out in the wild, the events of My Hero Academia 416 made the series’ current trajectory pretty clear: Midoriya is going to see what happened to Shigaraki, which will likely allow him to reach the destruction-driven inheritor of All for One in a last gambit to stop him. Or at least, that’s the best case scenario. It’s also entirely possible Shigaraki will double down on his desire to watch the world burn even with Midoriya’s pleading, forcing a less than ideal conclusion to their confrontation. Whether that means Midoriya has to finish off Shigaraki or the villain is simply unsavable remains to be seen, but you can bet it won’t be a perfectly happy ending. But then, this is all guess work on our part. We won’t know for sure what Horikoshi has in store until the new chapter releases later this week. Is My Hero Academia Ending in 2024? Explained That last point leads into an important question you need to be aware of as you read the series: Is My Hero Academia ending in 2024? For now, our answer leans heavily toward it ending before the year is through. As laid out above, there aren’t many more conflicts to wrap up before the series’ conclusion, so it’s wouldn’t be a stretch to say the series will conclude once Midoriya and Shigaraki’s fight is done. However, Horikoshi and Shonen Jump haven’t made any official announcements about the series’ conclusion at this time. We can take this to mean that there might be a few more months left of chapters to go, or even that there might be enough story to get through that it could last all the way through to the end of the year. We’ll be keeping an eye out for any official announcements regarding the series’ conclusion, and will update this article accordingly once such news is made available. Now that you’re all caught up on when this year’s My Hero Academia chapters are coming out, you can get caught up on the release calendars for other hot series like [Chainsaw Man](https://twinfinite.net/guides/chainsaw-man-2024-manga-chapter-release-date-calendar/) and [Jujutsu Kaisen](https://twinfinite.net/guides/jujutsu-kaisen-2024-chapter-release-date-calendar-2024/).",
