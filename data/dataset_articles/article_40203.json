  "text": "Yahoo TV UK Gary Neville makes emotional investment on Dragon's Den The football pundit told a tearful young entrepreneur she was 'pushing me over the edge.' Read full article Albertina Lloyd · Contributor March 1, 2024 at 12:18 a.m. · 4 min read Gary Neville admitted he was feeling emotional on Dragons' Den. (BBC) What did you miss?\nDragons' Den star Gary Neville confessed he was at risk of bursting into tears as he considered investing in an enthusiastic young entrepreneur.\nThe football pundit returned to the Den as a guest investor where he made a £50k offer in sports recovery company Myo Master , run by couple Lottie and Joe. While all the Dragons felt the sports massage and ice bath market was over crowded, they couldn't help being won over by enthusiastic Lottie who turned every criticism fired at her into a positive.\nWhat, how, and why? Gary Neville returned to Dragon's Den. (BBC) Retired footballer told Neville said: \"I think you've picked market that is packed and busy and competitive. You've not got your technology away yet and it's not been designed. But Joe I like your story and Lottie you are unbelievable. You are a class act and I've never met anybody under interrogation... and you're getting emotional which is pushing me over the edge.\" He took a deep breath and laughed: \"Never make an emotional investment!\"\nBut he went on: \"So I will offer you half the money, but I want another Dragon in with me.\"\nPeter Jones, Deborah Meaden and Sara Davies all made the couple competitive offers of the full £100k they were seeking, and after conferring at the back of the Den they asked Davies if she would team up with Neville on the investment.\nDavies said: \"I would love to work with Gary and he has a lot more knowledge in this market than I do.\" Neville agreed: \"I'm happy.\"\nAs former rugby player Joe and Lottie left the Den, Neville said: \"I've never met anyone like her in my life.\" Davies admitted: \"We haven't had anyone like her in the Den. Good partnership.\"\nWhat else happened on Dragons' Den? Dragons' Den star Sara Davies teamed up with other dragons for several investments. (BBC) Jayne Sibley and Marty Orton tugged on the Dragons' heart strings with their business Sibstar - a debit card and app for sufferers of dementia and their families, which has already [partnered with the Alzheimer's Society and Mastercard.\nStory continues Neville told them: \"I love the fact that you've set up this business from a personal story. I actually donated 50 per cent of the profits form my media platform to the Alzheimer's Society. I've got a personal interest in this from my background in football.\" He added: \"Can I tell you where I'm at? I've got a great love of your story and I just worry what I as an investor would be able to bring to this particular company? So for that reason I'm out.\"\nSteven Bartlett confessed he was torn as to whether he wanted to get involved with their business as a matter of the heart or a business decision. He said he wished he could donate to their cause, but he didn't see it as an investable business. And Peter Jones and Touker Souleyman both commended their efforts and also declared themselves out.\nBut Deborah Meaden and Sara Davies both decided that though the banking sector was a risky business the wanted to invest and both offered £62.5k for five per cent of the business, working together.\nDavies told them: \"I feel like I want to say on behalf of all the families going through this a massive thank you. I think it's wrong the banks aren't tackling this and I take my hat off to you.\"\nAs the couple left the Den Neville said: \"Did you see the hug?\" Davies told him: Do you know what Gary? That is the best part of this job and seeing what it does to people.\"\nDragon's Den airs on BBC One at 8pm on Thursday.\nRead more: Dragons' Den The most successful products from Dragons' Den and where to buy them (Bradford Telegraph and Argus, 3 min read)\nDragons' Den: BBC adds disclaimer to episode criticised for claim that ear seeds can help recovery from ME (Deadline, 2 min read)\nDragons' Den stars secure offer 'because of Meghan Markle' (The Independent, 2 min read)\nTRENDING 1.
