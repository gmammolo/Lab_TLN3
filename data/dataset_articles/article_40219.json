  "text": "One School at a Time: Jimtown Junior High wins Martin’s grant ELKHART COUNTY, Ind. (WNDU) - Jimtown Junior High seventh graders know a good book when they see one. “That’s pretty cool about the different kinds that there are,” said Conner Williams, a seventh-grade student at Jimtown. What does reading do for these kids? “For me, in my own mind, if I’m reading a book I can like imagine what’s happening. Like what’s going on,” said classmate Theran Harder. Language Arts teacher Brittany Hedman applied for the Martin’s One School at a Time grant with one goal in mind: buy more books! “They can learn the skills that they need through these engaging books,” Hedman said. Hedman wants to purchase several copies of different books they can read together as a class. The Martin’s money is a big help. “To purchase like class sets of these books is you know very expensive,” Hedman said. “On a teacher’s salary, I can’t afford to buy class sets of books for everybody.” “An example of one of the books that I chose would be ‘The Outsiders.’ They needed to realize that just because this book was written in this time period, those things are still relevant today,” Hedman said. Her students are listening. “Getting to know what’s going on. And like, knowing like, what happened back then. And like it that it’s still happening now,” said seventh grader Paeyton Hughes. And the best part? Improved reading skills. “I’ve gotten like better at it and I’d love to read more,” Hughes said.
