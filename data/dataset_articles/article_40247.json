  "text": "[](/u/freeguy_by_wmc/)\nUber (UBER): What a ride!\n[BATS:UBER](/symbols/NYSE-UBER/)Uber Technologies, Inc.\nUber (UBER):\nWe've recently added Uber to our portfolio, noting its astonishing 400% rise from the COVID-19 low of $13.71. This surge is significant, and we anticipate that in the current wave 3 we're experiencing, the price could reach between $101 and $201. The precise target seems to lean towards the $101 mark, aligning with the 161.8% extension level. Currently, the high is at $81.86. We expect a pullback in the coming days and weeks to between $59.40 and $52.46, corresponding to the 38.2% to 50% retracement levels.\nThere's a possibility of forming an Expanded Flat leading to wave 4, a pattern observed in waves 1 and 2, suggesting a potential deviation from the anticipated zigzag or other formations. Thus, surpassing the $81.86 mark would not be incorrect, provided it does not exceed the 138% threshold. Following this wave 4, we foresee the completion of wave 3 at a minimum of $101. A limit order will be placed at the first sign of weakness.\n[UBER](/symbols/NYSE-UBER/)\nWe've recently added Uber to our portfolio, noting its astonishing 400% rise from the COVID-19 low of $13.71.
