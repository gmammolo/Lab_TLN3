  "text": "Alysha Newman, Canada's pole vaulting star, is not just content with breaking records; she's on a mission to soar even higher. After setting a new indoor Canadian record at 4.83m in France, Newman is eyeing another record-breaking performance at the World Athletics Indoor Championships in Glasgow, Scotland. Her recent achievements and ambitions signal a strong comeback, fueled by newfound joy in the sport and a supportive team.\nRecord-Breaking Aspirations\nNewman's recent record of 4.83 meters at a meet in Rouen, France, has set the stage for her next challenge at the World Athletics Indoor Championships. With the competition just around the corner, Newman is determined to outdo herself and break the Canadian record once again. Her confidence is high, thanks to a special pole that she believes can help her achieve even greater heights, potentially making her a strong contender for Olympic medals in the future.\nConsistency and Confidence\nThe key to Newman's recent success and her goals for the future lies in consistency and the right equipment. Having competed in 11 events since January, including sprints, Newman has shown remarkable consistency, with several jumps over 4.70 meters. This level of performance, she believes, is crucial for competing at the highest levels, including the Olympics. Her coach, Zdenek Krykorka, echoes this sentiment, expressing confidence in Newman's ability to surprise many with her performance this year.\nOvercoming Challenges\nNewman's journey has not been without its challenges, including injuries and doubts about her future in the sport. However, with the support of her team and a renewed love for pole vaulting, she has managed to turn things around. This year, she's putting her focus squarely on her sport, calling it her \"selfish era,\" and it's paying off. As she prepares for the championships in Glasgow, Newman is not just looking to break records; she's aiming to prove to herself and the world that she is far from done.",
