  "text": "KINGSTON, N.Y. — Five Kingston High athletes will be competing in seven events in the New York State Public High School Athletic Association (NYSPHAA) Indoor Track and Field Championships Saturday on Staten Island. Juniors Daniella Johnson, Andrew Lee, Joe McDonald Jr., Lukas Paunovic and Maia Rich will be competing at the NYSPHAA event at the Ocean Breeze Athletic Complex. Johnson, who will be making her second straight appearance at the indoor state track and field meet, admitted there is more pressure due to her higher expectations in the shot put and the weight throw. She hopes to use her experience to enhance her performance and increase her comfort level. Johnson is currently ranked third in the state in the shot put and 14th in the weight throw. Lee is a veteran of state meets. He’s twice competed in the states in cross country and has been at the indoor and outdoor championships once each. Lee will be competing in the 3,200-meter run where he is currently ranked 20th in the state. “A time below 9 minutes, 20 seconds could lead to a medal,” Lee said. “I am going to race with everything I have and will not hold back.” Lee believes he’ll be able to achieve his goal due to the stellar competition. McDonald will be competing in both the high jump and long jump. He currently ranks first in the state and fifth nationally in the high jump. He ranks 30th in the state in the long jump. McDonald began the season by breaking the school’s indoor record for the high jump and tying the overall school record of 6 feet, 10 inches held by his father Joe McDonald Sr. “This was the strongest way to start the season,” said McDonald, who said he expects to win the state indoor high jump championship. Rich will be at the state indoor meet for the first time in the 300-meter dash. Although she currently is ranked sixth in the state in the 55-meter high hurdles, she barely failed to qualify for the states in that event. “I am excited to make it for indoor and while I’m upset I won’t be competing in the hurdles, I am going to run the best 300 that I can,” Rich said. “I’m not worried where I place overall, but just want to run my best time, and I think the competition will help me achieve a personal best.” Paunovic will be competing in his first indoor state championship in the 1,000-meter run where he is currently ranked 44th overall in the state. He was an alternate for Section 9’s 3,400-meter relay team last year. “I’ve competed many times at the state qualifier, but never qualified,” Paunovic said. “It feels great to finally be able to compete.” Paunovic said he expects a personal best time this weekend because he will be competing against some of the best runners in the state.",
