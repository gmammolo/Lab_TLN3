  "text": "The Richmond Women's Resource Centre (RWRC) is inviting Richmondites to join its [International Women's Day celebration](https://richmondwomenscentre.org/2024-iwd-celebration/) this weekend. On Saturday, March 2, community members can enjoy a three-course lunch and listen to guest speakers and presentations at Steveston's Ember Indian Kitchen. The theme of this year's celebration is \"Invest in women: Accelerate progress.\" The celebration is part of RWRC's biggest fundraiser of the year and proceeds will benefit the non-profit's operation. RWRC, which operates out of the Caring Place, relies on grants, donations and fundraisers and does not receive regular funding. It was founded more than four decades ago to promote women's rights, and [has been dedicated social activism ever since](https://www.richmond-news.com/local-news/richmond-womens-centre-has-long-history-of-social-activism-6008142). Some issues it advocates for include abortion rights, child care and housing, and it offers programming including computer training, English conversation and writing, a grandmothers support group and income-tax preparation for low-income families. RWRC is also holding [an online auction](https://can.givergy.com/RichmondWomensResourceCentre2024/?controller=lots&category=All%20Lots) from Feb. 26 to March 15, with items including foodie tours, whale-watching vouchers, retail vouchers and wine. The International Women's Day celebration will run from noon to 2 p.m. with reception beginning at 11:30 a.m. Tickets to the event are $65 per person plus tax and are [available online](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/2024-international-womens-day-celebration-and-auction-tickets-795740861337?aff=oddtdtcreator). Community members can also register by calling the RWRC office at 604-279-7060 or emailing [office@richmondwomenscentre.org](mailto:office@richmondwomenscentre.org). - With files from Maria Rantanen",
