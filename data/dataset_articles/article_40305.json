  "text": "People who are struggling now have a single online platform to visit that will help connect them with resources in the community. Roanoke is the first city in the nation to launch [Link2Hope](http://link2hoperoanoke.org/). A launch event for the online platform took place on Thursday at First Baptist Roanoke. The platform currently has 150 different uses including area volunteers, families, organizations and churches. It is managed through Friendship House, a religious-based nonprofit community-outreach organization. Nancy Friesen, lead coordinator with Link to Hope and Restoring Hope coordinator at Friendship House said individuals can both post needs and meet needs for others as well using the platform. “Roanoke is the perfect size city for it,” Friesen said. “We are a small city, but we have all the big city problems. We have a high poverty rate, drug abuse and lack of affordable housing.” People are also reading… Individuals can seek help for a variety of needs such as household repairs, financial advice, transportation and where to find area food pantry providers. “There’s some give and take, Friesen said. “We love it because it builds community.” For more, go to [link2hoperoanoke.org](http://link2hoperoanoke.org).
