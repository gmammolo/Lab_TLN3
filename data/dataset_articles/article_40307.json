  "text": "Cancer and the Black community: How 2 Northeast Ohio women are working to reverse a deadly trend CLEVELAND, Ohio (WOIO) - The Authentic Healing Cancer Support Group is a haven for cancer patients and their loved ones. Each person feels the impact of this deadly disease. “If we don’t learn to advocate for ourselves, we won’t receive the care that we need” said founder Staci Kirk. Incredibly, Kirk is a five-time survivor. She said she had to be proactive to beat cancer that many times. “When I was going through Hodgkin’s disease, it took me six doctors before I was actually diagnosed,” said Kirk. In January, Lynn and Nare Chaney would learn their loved one Corinne Smith lost her battle with cancer “I just want to cry. You look at people you love, friends, family and you say, ‘What happened?’” Lynn Chaney said. According to the American Cancer Society, Black people experience greater obstacles to cancer prevention, treatment, and survival because of systemic factors. In a survey from the organization, 32% of Black women say they have experienced racial discrimination at a health provider visit. “In my personal experience with patients, one of them is that people don’t believe them” said Cleveland Clinic Oncologist Dr. Tiffany Onger. Onger told 19 News this fight is personal. Her mother is a survivor and has the same experience as so many Black patients. She said she believes the first step to true change is diversity. “Here at the Cleveland Clinic, while we know that nationally only about 2.5% of oncologists are Black,” said Onger. “We’re working on pipeline programs going all the way to the high school level.” If you ever feel unheard or ignored by a medical professional, here is Onger’s advice: “Have a personal advocate. Someone that comes with you to your appointment to be a second set of eyes and ears.” Eyes, ears, and a strong community like Authentic Healing can help create strong survivors like Kirk. “I have things to do, I have places to go, and people to see. This thing has not stopped me yet. It’s not going to stop me now,” said Kirk. Learn more about [Authentic Healing Cancer Support Group here.](https://www.stacipurposekirk.com/) Copyright 2024 WOIO.
