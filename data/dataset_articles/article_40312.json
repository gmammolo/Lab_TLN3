  "text": "Spring is just around the corner and, already, daffodils, crocus, and tulips are beginning to emerge from the winter soils. Along with them is the familiar and exciting buzz of activity at Brady’s Garden and Spa Center, which is preparing not only for the busy spring season but also for its 30th-anniversary party. “We throw a good party so it’s just good to celebrate,” said co-owner Dean Brady. Brady’s will celebrate their 30th anniversary from 5 to 8 p.m. Friday at 1121 S. 9th St. Mystic 7 will be on hand to provide live music and, according to Dean, there will be libations, gambling for prizes, appetizers (provided by Chicago Bob’s), and other entertainment to fill out the evening. One of the evening’s grand prizes up for grabs will be a Ukiah Bluetooth fire pit, which regularly sells for about $1,000. Other prizes include commemorative 30th-anniversary shopping bags, hats, and tools. The party is open to all age groups and, according to Dean, “the more the merrier.” Though Brady’s has sat at 1121 S. 9th St. since it opened March 1, 1994, the family’s history of gardening stretches back to the 1960s. It was Dick Brady, Dean’s father, who opened Brady’s Evergreen Nursery in Westcliffe in 1961. In 1970, the nursery moved to its current location in Cañon City and has remained for 53 solid years. Dean and his three brothers Darren, Derald, and Delwin are all equal partners in the business and, between them, have mountains of gardening and landscaping expertise. “We were born and raised in the nursery,” Dean said. Thirty years have flown by for Dean, his wife, Angela, and their staff and he fondly remembers their first day in business. “The first lady that came in didn’t have any cash, and I really wanted the first sale to be in cash so she was really nice and went to the bank and got cash and came back,” he said with a smile. The first dollar is still framed at the store and, through the years, Brady’s has continued to grow. Since opening their doors, Brady’s has added the greenhouse on the south wall of the main building and they even purchased the property to the north to start the spa center and make room for dirt, mulches, and trees from the nursery. “We carry trees, shrubs, annuals, perennials, insecticides, herbicides but with a knowledgable staff and with the knowledge to use things correctly,” Dean said. In 2008, the brothers opened Brady’s West Garden Center in Salida and have experienced success in that area, as well. “We have a whole, whole lot of experience and history and years in this business,” Dean said about the successful storefronts. Twelve members of the Brady family currently work at the two storefronts in Cañon City and Salida and, although Dean and his brothers have yet to name a successor(s), the family name courses strong through the successful businesses. In addition to being a spring and summer staple for Fremont County, Brady’s has also given back to the community in numerous ways during its three decades, including donations to the Canon Literacy Center, the Fireman’s Ball, the Cañon City Pregnancy Center, and dozens of other worthy causes. In fact, Brady’s donated the blue spruce trees that were planted at the candlelight vigil that was held Oct. 15 to grieve the victims of the Return to Nature Funeral Home. “This is my home and always will be. We’re part of the community and always will be,” Dean said. “Cañon’s given us a lot so we like to give back.”",
