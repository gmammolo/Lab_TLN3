  "text": "On March 25, 2024, the Boca West Country Club will buzz with excitement as more than 400 golf enthusiasts gather for a noble cause at the 12th Annual Boca West Children's Foundation Golf Challenge. This esteemed event aims to raise funds for over 30 children's charities across Palm Beach County, promising a day filled with sportsmanship and philanthropy.\nCommunity and Charity Unite\nThe Golf Challenge has become a staple event in Palm Beach County, drawing participants and spectators alike to support the local community. Pamela Weinroth, the executive director of the Boca West Children's Foundation, highlights the importance of the event, \"The Golf Challenge is an annual fundraiser, and so many people from the community participate in our shared effort to support local kids.\" Non-golfers are also encouraged to join the fun by attending the cocktail reception and dinner, ensuring that everyone has a chance to contribute.\nExciting Events and Generous Donations\nThe day kicks off with registration and brunch at 11 a.m., followed by a unique duck drop event at 12:30 p.m., where participants have a shot at winning $2,500. The golf challenge itself starts at 1 p.m., with a cocktail reception, dinner, and live auction rounding off the evening. The competition is fierce as charities vie for a portion of the $100,000 awarded during the tournament, with each charity guaranteed to receive between $3,000 and $15,000 depending on their team's performance.\nImpact Beyond the Green\nSince its inception, the Boca West Children's Foundation has granted over $18 million to projects serving at-risk youth. This year's Golf Challenge is yet another opportunity to add to that impressive total, providing essential support to those in need within the Palm Beach County community. It's a testament to the power of collective effort and the difference it can make in the lives of local children.\nThe Boca West Children's Foundation's 12th Annual Golf Challenge is more than just a day of golf; it's a celebration of community spirit and the profound impact of philanthropy. As participants and spectators come together, they are reminded of the significant difference they can make, one swing at a time.",
