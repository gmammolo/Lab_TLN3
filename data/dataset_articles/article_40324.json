  "text": "CONCORD, N.H. — Overdose deaths in New Hampshire’s two largest cities are on the decline, according to the latest data released by the ambulance company American Medical Response.\nNashua saw a 46 percent decrease in suspected overdoses from opioids in January compared to the last 12-month average, while Manchester saw an even greater decrease of 56 percent, according to AMR, which provides ambulance services in the two cities. Last month, there were two opioid overdose deaths in Nashua and five in Manchester.\nWhen the opioid crisis hit the state in 2015, AMR was inundated, according to Chris Stawasz, the company’s regional director of government affairs.\nAdvertisement\n“We became overwhelmed in 2015, 2016, and decided to start tracking the number of overdoses we were going on, so we could see the resources we were spending and come up with a way to address it,” Stawasz said.\nSince then, the substances on the street have evolved: First, AMR was responding to people smoking “spice,” a kind of synthetic marijuana . Then it was heroin, and now fentanyl dominates, according to Stawasz. Illegally producedFentanyl — because of its potency and low cost — is now being mixed into marijuana, catching users unaware, he said.\nGet N.H. Morning Report A weekday newsletter delivering the N.H. news you need to know right to your inbox. Enter Email Sign Up According to the US Drug Enforcement Administration, doctors prescribe fentanyl for chronic severe pain or severe pain following surgery.\nStawasz said responders no longer see overdoses related to prescription drugs, pointing to laws requiring increased monitoring of such medicines.\nSo what’s causing the decrease in opioid overdoses and deaths? It’s hard to pinpoint what is driving the several-month trend, Stawasz said.\n“I’d like to think the efforts everyone has been putting in for so long have been paying off,” he said, noting there hasn’t been a sea change in terms of the amount of fentanyl available or the number of available rehabilitation centers.\nAdvertisement",
