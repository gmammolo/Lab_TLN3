  "text": "Punjab launches first Green Policing Unit with electric patrol vehicles\nUse of electric vehicles is expected to save about 4,500 litres of fuel per vehicle annually\nPunjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has inaugurated Pakistan’s first Green Policing Unit, introducing the country’s first electric patrol vehicle for police operations, a move that officials said would help reduce fuel costs and carbon emissions. The initiative makes Punjab the first province to deploy electric vehicles for police patrolling.\nDuring the inauguration ceremony, the chief minister inspected the electric patrol car and personally drove the vehicle. She was briefed on various aspects of the Green Policing Unit and the electric vehicle initiative. Officials said modern BYD electric vehicles would be used for traffic management and routine patrolling duties in Lahore.\nAccording to the briefing, the electric patrol vehicle has a driving range of up to 410 kilometres on a single charge and can be fast-charged from 30 to 80 per cent in approximately 30 minutes. The vehicle is equipped with a public address system, police lights, a 360-degree surveillance camera and speed detection equipment.\nPunjab Police/Traffic Dept have received their first fleet of electric patrolling vehicles, equipped with advanced cameras, sophisticated security & communication systems. This marks a major step toward smarter and more efficient policing.\n— Maryam Nawaz Sharif (@MaryamNSharif)\nPunjab is transforming at a rapid pace.[pic.twitter.com/fZdnEfJ5Bt][January 21, 2026]\nOfficials told the chief minister that 103 conventional patrol vehicles currently consume around 28,000 litres of fuel per month, costing approximately Rs7.42 million. The use of electric vehicles is expected to save about 4,500 litres of fuel per vehicle annually, significantly reduce operational costs and ensure zero carbon emissions.\nMaryam Nawaz directed authorities to gradually increase the number of electric vehicles in the Green Policing Unit and ordered steps to expand the initiative to other districts in phases.\nShe said the adoption of electric vehicles would help curb fuel expenses and promote zero carbon emissions, adding that green policing reflected the government’s vision for cleaner air and improved governance.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
