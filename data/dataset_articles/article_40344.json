  "text": "Jennifer Garner wants to take her dog skydiving.\nThe 51-year-old actress has an eight-year-old golden retriever named Birdie - who has been spending time at the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles as a therapy dog - and explained that amongst other items on her bucket list for her pet pooch, she wants to jump out of a plane with her.\nSpeaking in a video for the 'We Rate Dogs' YouTube series, she explained: \"She wants to read some new books for kids. And speaking of kids, Birdie is a therapy dog. And she just got a promotion to work at Children's Hospital L.A.\n\"So she's excited. She wants to have her first time at Children’s Hospital L.A. before she turns nine.\n\"She’s a very good dog, a very good girl.”\n\"Birdie would like to sit at a Parisian bistro. While she's there, she wants to swim in the Olympics. She loves to swim. Oh, she wants to eat an entire string of cheese. The whole thing. Birdie wants to skydive. Everybody should once and she thought before she turns nine is a good time.\"\nThe '13 Going on 30' star - who was previously married to fellow Hollywood star Ben Affleck and has Violet, 18, Seraphina, 15, and 12-year-old Samuel with him - also joked that Birdie has a \"crush\" on President Joe Biden's canine companion.\nShe added: \"Oh right, she wants to go on a date with Major Biden. She has a big crush. Oh, and she wants to stop biting her nails. It’s hard, but it’s good to have a goal.\n\"Birdie has a beautiful coloratura voice. So she's a soprano and so she wants to sing with the Metropolitan Opera.\"\nJennifer recalled that Birdie came into her life as a gift for her eldest, whom she had initially told when she was two years old that she could have a dog when she turned 10 and expected she would eventually forget about the promise.\nShe said: \"My eldest was two and decided she needed her own dog, and she talked about it all the time. And I said, ‘When you're 10, that's the age that one might get their own dog.’ And I thought she’d forget because she was just two, but now we have Birdie. She did not forget!\"",
