  "text": "A&M softball opens Judi Garman Classic with pair of wins FULLERTON, Calif. – Texas A&M starter Emiley Kennedy struck out 12 batters in a three-hit shutout win over Michigan, 6-0, Thursday at Anderson Family Field. Kennedy (8-0) dominated the circle to remain undefeated on the season, while registering a seventh complete game and fifth shutout of the year. The hard lefty thrower punched out double-digit batters for the third time this season and second consecutive outing. Michigan (10-6) sent 25 batters to plate, while four reached safely and only one threatened in scoring position. Texas A&M (16-1) scored one run in the opening frame and later doubled the lead after a solo home run courtesy of Jazmine Hill in the third. The Aggies have homered in 13 games this season, including a round tripper in four consecutive games. Ol’ Sarge’s charges opened it up in the fifth inning plating four runs on three hits, including a two-run double by Rylen Wiggins to make it 6-0. The No. 18 Texas A&M softball team run-ruled Long Beach State, 16-7, in six innings, Thursday night at the Anderson Family Field. Texas A&M (17-1) blasted four home runs and three doubles on 14 hits. Julia Cottrill led the way with a pair of round trippers and five RBI, while Trinity Cannon added a home run and four RBI and Rylen Wiggins hit a solo dinger. Kramer Eschete added to the offensive attack recording a double and three RBI. The Maroon & White put five runs on the board in the opening frame and third inning, while adding four more in the fourth and a two more in the sixth for the walk-off run-rule. Long Beach State (2-14) jumped out to an early 3-0 lead in the first inning after an Aggie error and fielder’s choice. The Aggies led 10-3 after three innings, before Beach narrowed the lead scoring four runs on four walks and two hits to come within three. Texas A&M ended all hope matching the scoreboard in the bottom half to put Beach back at seven-run deficit before ultimately ending it in the sixth. The home run derby marked the ninth time for the Maroon & White to hit multiple home runs in a game and the fifth consecutive game with at least one round tripper. Texas A&M plays two games on Friday beginning with Weber State at 5 p.m. and host Cal State Fullerton at 9:30 p.m., which can be streamed on ESPN+. Copyright 2024 KBTX. All rights reserved.",
