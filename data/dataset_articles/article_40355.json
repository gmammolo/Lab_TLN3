  "text": "Malone Named to SEC Community Service Team BIRMINGHAM – Texas A&M women’s basketball player Jada Malone was named to the 2024 SEC Community Service Team for her contributions to the local Brazos Valley community, the league announced Thursday. Malone has been an active participant in Aggies CAN which is an organization that has grown into the largest student-athlete volunteer run canned food drive in the nation. The collections for Aggies CAN are given back to families and organizations to help impact the Bryan-College Station area. The Spring, Texas, native is also the president of We3 (We Cubed). The organization seeks to encourage, equip and empower female student-athlete during their career at Texas A&M. Malone is an integral piece for the Texas A&M REVved Up to Read Program which allows student-athletes to visit with young students in the area to read a book and talk about the importance of literacy and education. Additionally, Malone has been the women’s basketball representative for the Aggies for the past two years at the SEC Basketball Leadership Council. This marks the first community service honor for the junior. She was also involved in the women’s basketball team bike build that donated over 125 bikes and helmets to children in Aggieland over the holiday season. The Aggies return to Reed Arena for their final game of the regular season against the Alabama Crimson Tide on Sunday, March 3 at 2 p.m., where they will also honor their seniors on Senior Day.
