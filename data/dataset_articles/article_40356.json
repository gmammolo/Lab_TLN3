  "text": "Boston police are praising a “courageous” bystander who they said chased down a woman accused of robbing a bank and restrained her while police arrived.\nPolice responded to a bank alarm at 501 Southampton St. in South Boston shortly after 11:15 a.m. on Wednesday, when they were told a robbery had just happened, according to\na statement by police.\nThe suspect, who police described as a woman about five feet tall wearing a white disposable surgical mask, had fled in an unknown direction, police said.\nAfter broadcasting the woman’s description, police were flagged down by the bystander on Father Songin Way, where he was restraining a woman matching the suspect’s description, police said.\nThe bystander told police he noticed the suspect running from the bank parking lot with red smoke coming from her sweatshirt pocket and chased her down Dorchester Avenue and onto Father Songin Way, police said.\nHe was able to restrain the suspect, according to police.\nPolice arrested Miriam Dealmeida, 38, of Boston and charged her with unarmed bank robbery, with further charges anticipated for a separate bank robbery earlier in the day at East West Bank at 68 Kneeland St., police said. Dealmeida is expected to be arraigned at South Boston District Court.\n______",
