  "text": "Cental Texas businesses collecting donations for Texans affected wildfires in panhandle Texas (KWTX) - As first responders all over Texas fight the fires in the panhandle, businesses in central Texas are stepping up to help those who have lost everything.

Ten minutes down the road, the Rosebud feed and grain storefront has all types of seed, hay, and feed for cattle and animals that you can buy.
