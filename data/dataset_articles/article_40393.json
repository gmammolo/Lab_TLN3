  "text": "Miami Herald Wife dreams she won lottery, then has husband buy a ticket. Prize leaves him ‘shaking’ Paloma Chavez February 29, 2024 at 10:38 PM · 2 min read 1 Link Copied Read full article\nA man in Maryland was left stunned after listening to his wife’s advice about buying a lottery ticket, officials said.\nThe restaurant employee’s wife was overseas when she had a dream the two won “a lot of money” playing the lottery , according to a Feb. 29 news release by the Maryland Lottery.\nThat’s when she told him to go buy a ticket, officials said.\nThe Glen Burnie man, who plays Powerball and Mega Millions when the jackpot catches his eye, drove to a 7-Eleven in Pasadena and bought a $10 Fast Play Mega Multiplier ticket, officials said.\n“It wasn’t a Powerball or Mega Millions night, those are the games I first thought to play,” the man told lottery officials. “But then, I saw the Mega Multiplier ticket.”\nOnce the man “saw the matching numbers” on his ticket, his “legs started shaking,” officials said.\nHe had won $100,000.\n“I thought about keeping it from my wife until she returns next week, but I couldn’t. Our phone call that night was a very happy one,” he told officials.\nThe man said he’s previously won a few $500 lottery prizes over the years.\n“I thought I was pretty lucky, I never really expected to win more than that,” he told lottery officials.\nThe man won the fourth top prize in the game, officials said. There are 26 $100,000 prizes remaining as of Feb. 29.\nPasadena is about 20 miles south of Baltimore.\nMany people can gamble or play games of chance without harm. However, for some, gambling is an addiction that can ruin lives and families.\nIf you or a loved one shows signs of gambling addiction, you can seek help by calling the national gambling hotline at 1-800-522-4700 or visiting the National Council on Problem Gambling website.\n‘Imagination became reality’ for mechanic who used former ZIP code as lottery numbers\nAvid lottery player thought win was ‘too good to be true’ in Maryland. He was wrong\nLucky lottery ticket stuns man who went shopping for animal feed. ‘Absolute disbelief’\nView comments",
