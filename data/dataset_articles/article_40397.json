  "text": "MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota – The Texas Center for the Missing has canceled an Amber Alert for 1-year-old Noah Johnson -- who has been found safe.\nThe Harris County Precinct 8 Constable’s Office said Noah Johnson was located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and was being evaluated by medical personnel in that city.\nHis mother, Kamilah Johnson, was taken into custody by the Minneapolis Police Department on an active arrest warrant filed by the agency, for a felony charge of Child Endangerment.\nAmber Alerts were issued in the states of Missouri and Minnesota over the last three weeks as authorities learned new information on Noah’s possible whereabouts.\n“At this time, we can report that Noah is safe and is getting the medical attention he desperately needs,” the agency said.\nThere were grave concerns for the child’s welfare because of his multiple health problems, including thyroid issues and congestive heart failure.\nORIGINAL STORY: 1-year-old kidnapped from Houston is in desperate need of medication, officials say Kamilah Johnson is accused of kidnapping Noah on Feb. 6 in the 11400 block of Space Center Boulevard in southeast Houston.\nAccording to court documents, Johnson took Noah out of Texas Children’s Hospital on Jan. 30 against medical advice.\nOn Feb. 6., a Texas Department of Family Protective Services caseworker went to Kamilah’s residence for a welfare check on Noah. When she was instructed to get the baby medical attention, Kamilah reportedly refused assistance and told the caseworker to come back with a warrant.\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol reported Noah’s mother was seen at a Walmart in Kansas City Monday.\nThis is a developing story. Check back here for updates.\nSEE ALSO: Why was the AMBER Alert system created?
