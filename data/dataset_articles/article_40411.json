  "text": "I'm just a Trello board member/user, no administrator. How I could adjust the way Trello shows the modification dates of \"Card Attachments\" in some sort of logical format like \"2024-02-29, 20:45\" instead of \"6 hours ago\"? Yes, if I put the mouse over the \"Six hours ago\" I can see the proper timestamp, but how to get rid of \"6 hours ago\" or \"Last week\" and directly get the proper timestamp on my personal view as a guest/member/user of Trello board?",
