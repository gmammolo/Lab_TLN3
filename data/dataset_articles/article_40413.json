  "text": "Demetrius “Big Meech” Flenory is on the verge of securing an early release from prison, following a judge’s decision to reduce his sentence by 32 months. This pivotal ruling could see Flenory walking free in 2025, three years prior to his originally scheduled release.\nFlenory, a key figure behind the notorious Black Mafia Family, was initially sentenced to 30 years behind bars for leading an extensive network involved in drug and weapons trafficking. Since the 1990s, the organization has amassed a fortune estimated at $270 million under his leadership.\nThe potential for Flenory’s early release is the result of vigorous legal efforts by his attorney, Brittany K. Barnett of the\nBuried Alive Project. Barnett’s strategy focused on leveraging a change in the United States Criminal Code, particularly section 18 582(c)(2), which was amended by Amendment 821. This amendment suggests adjustments to sentencing guidelines for individuals with records similar to Flenory’s, offering a reduction in sentencing points for those with six or fewer disciplinary infractions.\nEXCLUSIVE: Big Meech Could Be Free Next Year If New Bid For Reduced Sentence Is Approved\nThroughout his time in prison, Flenory has made significant strides towards rehabilitation. He has been commended for his active participation in educational programs, leading seminars, and focusing on maintaining his health. His efforts to reform the image of the\nBlack Mafia Family into a positive force, through initiatives like the “Build More Families” campaign, highlight his dedication to making amends.\nFlenory’s journey from leading a criminal empire to advocating for change and rehabilitation illustrates a profound transformation, signaling a potential shift in his life’s trajectory pending his anticipated release.",
