  "text": "The United States Air Force Academy showcased a transgender-identifying activist and military service member who seeks to embed far-left gender ideology in the armed forces for a speech on leadership and inclusion. Lieutenant Colonel Bree Fram, an engineer with the United States Space Force and activist for transgenderism in the military, spoke at the National Character and Leadership Symposium, the theme of which was “Embrace Culture, Empower People.” The military official states that he is a co-leader of the Department of the Air Force LGBTQ+ Initiatives Team, which he says is “dedicated to eliminating barriers to LGBTQ+ military service in the Air and Space Force.” Fram was introduced at the Air Force Academy event as “one of the highest-ranking out transgender officers in the United States military” and a “featured speaker on leadership, diversity, and inclusion.” He is also an activist on behalf of transgenderism, previously serving as the president of SPARTA, “a non-profit that advocates and educates about transgender military service.” “Inclusion takes action, inclusion requires asking, inclusion requires understanding, and it is more work, it is a lot more work for a leader but I need you to be willing to do it,” Fram said to the crowd while wearing a patch on his uniform bearing a rainbow flag. “In the future, we are going to fight and win war with brain power, and if those brains happen to be in a trans body … you should want them serving alongside you. Because they might be the ones that revolutionize the way we fight in space, in cyber or in any other domain of war.” The speech comes as the Pentagon has promoted a leftwing agenda, asking for a whopping $114 million in fiscal year 2024 alone to fund diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts such as “unconscious bias diversity training,” and “training programs and diversity and inclusion initiatives,” a Daily Wire investigation revealed. The Air Force’s LGBT Initiatives Team , which Fram has helped lead, has also pushed leftwing ideology in the military, celebrating transgender day of visibility. The far-left ideological capture of America’s military coincides with an unprecedented recruiting crisis, with the Air Force, the Army, and the Navy all missing their recruiting goals in fiscal year 2023 and a particularly sharp decline in white recruits. Republican officials have warned that the politicization of the military could be alienating citizens who would otherwise consider joining the armed forces. But despite concerns that the far-left agenda might be dissuading potential recruits, Fram went on to ask those with leadership positions in the military to support leftwing agendas, showing a slide that says military members can “be allies by standing with and supporting marginalized communities … and advocates by speaking out and raising awareness on issues.” He also appeared to express concern over the potential reelection of former President Donald Trump. “While I don’t have a crystal ball, I can look out and say, ‘Well, either next year things will be great or I will be fighting for my ability to continue serving,'” Fram said. Fram has a history of pushing the transgender agenda in the military, arguing that inclusion is a matter of national security at a recent women’s empowerment conference. Trans Lt. Colonel suggests inclusion is a matter of national security. The world is laughing at us.
