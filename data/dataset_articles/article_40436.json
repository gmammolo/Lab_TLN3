  "text": "Jay May didn't recognize the three people who stood next to him near the lectern Thursday at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, but he knew why they were there.\n\"I am only here because these folks are here,\" May said during an event arranged by airport officials to allow him to meet the travelers who helped save his life after he went into cardiac arrest at the airport last summer. \"I want to say thank you. I consider myself one of the luckiest people on Earth.\"\nCardiac arrest is a condition that causes a victim to lose consciousness, and the heart stops, making CPR necessary. An automated external defibrillator (AED) can be used to shock the heart back into rhythm. Only about 10% of victims survive, said Dr. Haitham Hussein, president of the board of directors for the American Heart Association Twin Cities. Odds of survival double or triple if care is administered in the first few minutes.\nMark Kortesma, a fire captain in Duluth, and his wife, Kirsten, and Kyle Menzel, a physician from Hermantown, Minn., knew how to do CPR. On July 28 at about 9:30 p.m., they were standing near carousel No. 8 when May blacked out and fell to the floor. The trio rushed to his aid and used a defibrillator to give May's heart two shocks and chest compressions by hand until help arrived.\nFor their efforts, Hussein on Thursday presented them with the Heartsaver Hero Award, given for \"performing the heroic act of CPR\" during cardiac emergencies.\n\"Thank you for jumping into action and saving Jay's life. You are inspiring,\" Hussein said. \"We can transform a nation of bystanders into a nation of lifesavers.",
