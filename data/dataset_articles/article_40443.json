  "text": "Ochsner Lafayette General announces Leap Day babies Occurring only once every four years, what better way to commemorate Leap Day than by welcoming new life into the world? As the world marks this extra day on the calendar today, local families’ hearts leap with joy as they celebrate the arrival of their babies, who are born on this unique day. Happening every four years (although [there are some exceptions](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/28/how-often-is-leap-year/72585971007/)), the last leap days were in 2020 and 2016, and the next leap year will happen in 2028. This year Ochsner Lafayette General Medical Center’s first Leap baby was born at 12:12 a.m. and seven more have followed. Six more babies are expected to arrive before the end of the day. Ochsner LGMC is the largest birthing facility in the region. Alicia Goodley and Derrick Morris welcomed their baby boy Derrick at 7:21 a.m. His mother, Antonisha Walker and Brandon Haviland welcomed their baby boy, Braxton, at 8:45 a.m.",
