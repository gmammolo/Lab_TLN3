  "text": "Janis E. Burton, a cherished Quincy resident known for her deep community involvement and commitment to family, passed away peacefully at her home on February 22, 2024, at the age of 93. Born in Boston and a lifelong inhabitant of Houghs Neck, Quincy, her life was marked by service, leadership, and a profound dedication to her loved ones.\nLife and Legacy\nJanis's journey began in Boston, growing up in a family that valued faith and community. Her career as an executive secretary at the Lily Transportation Corporation showcased her professional dedication, while her personal life reflected a commitment to her community and family. A devout member of the First Baptist Church of Wollaston, Janis's faith informed much of her service, from leading the Campfire Girls to her extensive involvement with the National Association of Miniature Enthusiasts. Her leadership and passion for miniatures were well recognized, culminating in a 24-year presidency of the Tiny Treasures Society.\nCommunity Impact\nJanis's impact on her community extended beyond her professional achievements and hobbies. Her role as Chairperson of the Deacons and an expert on church by-laws at the First Baptist Church of Wollaston demonstrated her spiritual leadership and commitment to her faith community. Her dedication to nurturing the next generation was evident in her leadership with the Campfire Girls and involvement in summer camps at Camp Kiwanee. Janis's legacy is one of unwavering dedication to her community, family, and faith, leaving an indelible mark on those she touched.\nRemembering Janis\nA memorial service to celebrate Janis's life and contributions will be held at the First Baptist Church of Wollaston on March 16. The service is open to all who wish to commemorate her legacy. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the church in memory of Janis, ensuring her legacy of service and community involvement continues. Janis is survived by her loving family, including her daughter, son-in-law, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, who will carry forward her legacy of love, dedication, and service.\nAs the Quincy community reflects on the life of Janis E. Burton, her legacy serves as a reminder of the impact one individual can have on the lives of many. Her life's work, characterized by service, faith, and dedication to family, will continue to inspire those who knew her and the community she cherished.",
