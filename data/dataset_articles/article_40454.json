  "text": "In today’s fast-paced world, where the workplace often resembles a battlefield of expectations and pressures, finding solace and security in one’s professional environment can feel like an elusive dream. However, amidst these challenges, Jessica Bensch, Founder of Vanguard Voices, is changing workplaces around the globe one step at a time, starting with the [Speak Up Summit ’24](https://www.thespeakupsummit.com/). Scheduled for June 13th and 14th, 2024, this summit is not just another conference; it’s a rallying cry for individuals and organizations worldwide to prioritize psychological safety in the workplace. With over 24 hours of programming and 50+ global leaders uniting for this cause, the summit promises to be a transformative event. At the heart of this movement is the recognition that psychological safety is not merely a buzzword but a fundamental necessity for all. Bensch understands this deeply. As a multi-award winner for employee engagement, her passion for promoting psychological safety permeates every aspect of her work. In her own words, “Psychological safety at work requires deliberate, intentional focus and action with holistic solutions. This is a top-down, bottom-up, and side-to-side effort: from top-level leaders to front-line employees.” It’s a sentiment echoed by the global leaders who will be participating in the summit, each bringing their unique perspectives and expertise to the table. But what exactly is psychological safety, and why is it so crucial? Put simply, it’s the belief that one can speak up, take risks, and express themselves without fear of reprisal or judgment. In an environment characterized by psychological safety, individuals feel empowered to share their ideas, challenge the status quo, and collaborate effectively. The benefits of psychological safety extend far beyond individual well-being. Research has shown that psychologically safe workplaces are more innovative, productive, and resilient. They foster a culture of trust, belonging, and open communication, paving the way for organizational success in today’s rapidly evolving landscape. The Vanguard Voices Speak Up Summit ’24 is more than just a platform for discussion; it’s a call to action. Participants will have the opportunity to gain valuable insights from thought leaders, draw inspiration from groundbreaking ideas, and expand their networks within a global community united by a shared focus on psychological safety. This event is virtual, making it accessible to individuals across the world as Bensch not only wants local change, but global as well. Attendees will have the chance to interact with leaders and receive recordings of the sessions for future reference. But perhaps most importantly, the summit represents a catalyst for change. It’s a chance for individuals and organizations to come together, not only to talk about the importance of psychological safety but to actively work towards creating environments where it thrives. As Jessica Bensch aptly puts it, “The system only changes when everyone agrees to change.” So, to all those who seek psychological safety at work: the time to act is now. Join the many individuals who seek change at the Vanguard Voices Speak Up Summit ’24 and be a part of the movement to build a world where compassion, understanding, and psychological safety are not just aspirations but everyday realities.",
