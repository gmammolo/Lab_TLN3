  "text": "NEWS RELEASE CONNOR MAHON Connor Mahon and Friends: Concert in support of the Children’s Foundation of Guelph & Wellington will be held on March 10, 2024, 3 p.m., at St. George’s Anglican Church in Guelph. Connor Mahon is passionate about two things: playing music, and sharing music with others. The young Guelph pianist has become a feature in the Guelph musical community, regularly contributing to fundraising performances. Now, in his first solo recital since before the pandemic, Connor is once again partnering with the Children’s Foundation of Guelph and Wellington to raise funds for their Free to Grow Program, which provides funding for kids’ extracurricular activities. “It’s something that’s really important to me,” says Connor. “Every kid should get to have music lessons, or play sports. Whatever they are interested in.” “Understandably it’s a cause very close to our hearts,” adds Connor’s mom, Alexis Hoy. “Kids are capable of amazing things, given the opportunity to explore their talents. The Free to Grow Program helps more kids do just that.” The concert program will include works by Chopin, Prokofiev, and Gershwin among others. A composer in his own right, Connor will also perform some of his own award-winning compositions. For part of the program, Connor will be joined on stage by 13-year-old violinist Salma Khakimov, and 12-year-old cellist Ryan Yin, the members of the top-ranked Sacora Trio, for which Connor is the pianist. “We love seeing children and youth in our community come together like this,” says Megan Harron, Free to Grow Program Director at the Children’s Foundation of Guelph and Wellington. “Our Free to Grow Program helps nurture the physical, social, emotional, and mental well-being of children and youth by providing them funding to participate in activities, like music and the arts, recreation, and life skills activities. Seeing young folks like Connor using their skills and passion to raise awareness and funds to help other children and youth inspires us to do what we do. Together, alongside kids like Connor, we are empowering young people to thrive!” Tickets for the concert are $15 - 25, and available through [eventbrite.ca](http://eventbrite.ca/) or [connormahon.com](http://connormahon.com/).",
