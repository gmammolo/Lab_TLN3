  "text": "Recently, a Wawa convenience store staff member came across a rare coin while on duty. To know more about the lucky find, the employee took to Reddit to share details about it, and this sparked the interest of [coin](https://doyouremember.com/178150/coin-collector-reveals-how-identify-valuable-lincoln-penny) collectors and enthusiasts. In the post, the employee revealed that they found the coin while sorting through [a roll of coins](https://l.smartnews.com/p-tfzb4/pVieBb) in the store’s cash register. The penny, which is over a century old, appeared darker than usual and had a unique design that featured a Native American head. The rare coin could be worth a fortune [@thecoinchannel]100+ year old coin found in a penny roll at work. [#coinroll] [#valuablecoins] [#penny] [#coin] [#foryou] [♬ Mysterious and sad BGM(1120058) – S and N] Coin collectors and enthusiasts in the comment section of the post identified the coin to be penny minted in 1902, showcasing a design long discontinued production. A Redditor, Eric Miller, who is a coin evaluator, offered insight into its potential value. RELATED: [Coin Collector Lists Five Coins Worth More Than $10,000 And Up To $373,750](https://doyouremember.com/178202/five-coins-worth-more-than-10000-up-to-373750?utm_source=web&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=related) He emphasized that the year of minting can greatly affect the worth of a coin. Drawing comparisons, Miller pointed out that high-quality Indian head pennies from 1877 have fetched prices as high as $6,000. This suggests that the 1904 penny could potentially be worth even more, with a precedent set by a high-quality specimen selling for $11,400 in January 2021, as reported by the Professional Coin Grading Service. Miller has gained a wide following for sharing interesting details about coins on TikTok. The coin collector also pointed out a new detail in his recent post where he claimed a coin was projected to be worth over 30,000 times its normal worth due to a production error. Although Miller didn’t mention the name or the year the coin was produced, he explained that the coin featured Abraham Lincoln and that the error was located on his ear.",
