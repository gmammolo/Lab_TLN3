  "text": "Atta girl. If you’ve had a rough deer season… you’re not gonna want to read this… According to [WCCO](https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2017/12/20/2-deer-1-shot/), an 11-year-old Minnesota girl shot two deer with one shot while hunting with her father in Lyon County a couple years back. And here’s the kicker… it was only her second time hunting. Her father Andy described the scene: “She spotted a buck in the trees coming down the path.” With a .20 gauge shotgun in hand, one she had never fired before, young Skyla took aim at the buck who was coming her way, and then came to a standstill about 30 yards from their blind. And little did she know, a doe was right behind the target buck. “I waited and finally the buck stood straight and I took a shot at him. The buck fell over and the doe behind it fell over too.” Her dad had a doe tag he could slap on the downed deer, but it was absolutely the surprise of a lifetime for the proud dad: “I stared at them for two minutes and I can’t believe that happened. I’d never heard of it. It’s possible it’s happened before.” How about it? Only her second time hunting and she bags two deer with a single shot. I mean, how many hunters drag their butt out to the tree stand every morning, nearly freeze to death and don’t see a single living thing? A LOT of them, that’s how many. Dad should probably think about taking her to the casino, throw a little on black? Maybe have her pick a few numbers for the lottery… strike while the iron is hot, you know? Of course, for young Skyla, she was able to form a core memory so early in her hunting experience, and I can guarantee you that she’ll be hooked for life. Imagine if she sits out there with her dad and doesn’t see a deer? Maybe she wants to get back in the blind next year, maybe she doesn’t… but the ol’ two-fer will guarantee it. Gotta love it.",
