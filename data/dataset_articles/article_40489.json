  "text": "Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed signs Executive Order waiving fines and fees for municipal convictions more than 10 years old MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - If you are a Montgomery resident with unpaid fines you may be eligible for relief in April. This is all part of an executive order signed by Mayor Steven Reed. The executive order signed Thursday cancels certain unpaid fines, fees, and court costs assessed before Jan. 1, 2014. “From our standpoint, it’s not about excusing any behavior, it’s about recognizing that our current system does more harm than good,” said Mayor Reed. This order applies to most non-DUI traffic cases, misdemeanor marijuana offenses, and Class C misdemeanors. In total about 10 million dollars’ worth of fines will be waived. Mayor Reed says this is a new effort to change its approach to criminal justice. “Outstanding fines and fees, and costs associated with this municipal convictions have weighed heavily on individuals and their families. These financial burdens can hinder the ability to find stable housing, secure employment, and rebuilding lives. These initiatives will ensure that the financial burden doesn’t dictate who succeeds and who struggles in our city,” said Reed. Some of those municipal convictions may also have state-related costs which still need to be paid. The mayor hopes the state will follow suit and forgive those as well. Anyone who is eligible to have their municipal costs forgiven will be able to request information from the city about that starting April 5th. Not reading this story on the WSFA News App?
