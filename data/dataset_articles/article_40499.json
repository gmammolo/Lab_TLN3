  "text": "WASHINGTON— This afternoon, Congressman Tom Emmer (MN-06) spoke on the House floor in honor of Officer Paul Elmstrand of Chaska, as well as Officer Matthew Ruge and firefighter-paramedic Adam Finseth. The three were killed in the line of duty earlier this month while responding to a domestic incident in Burnsville.\nWATCH: Emmer speaks on the House floor in honor of Officer Paul Elmstrand, Officer Matthew Ruge and Adam Finseth Emmer’s remarks are available in full below:\nMister Speaker,\nI rise today in memory of Paul Elmstrand.\nPaul, an officer with the Burnsville Police Department, was killed earlier this month in the line of duty alongside Officer Matthew Ruge and firefighter-paramedic Adam Finseth.\nPaul lived in Chaska, but his story began in Isanti County. As senior class president and a member of the law enforcement club, he impressed his classmates with his strong sense of ethical integrity, his generosity and his sense of humor.\nAmong those classmates was his wife, Cindy, who he met in kindergarten and began dating in high school. Together, they shared two children, a two-year-old and a five-month-old.\nAt 27 years old, his life was cut tragically short. Paul, Matthew and Adam were killed trying to save seven children barricaded in a Burnsville home with an armed man, an act of heroism and sacrifice beyond measure.\nWe were privileged to have Paul as a member of our community, and a neighbor and friend. To Cindy, his children and all who loved him: he will not be forgotten.\nI yield back.\n###",
