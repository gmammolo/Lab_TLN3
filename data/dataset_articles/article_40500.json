  "text": "The Morin sisters approach their work guided by a fundamental principle: No judgment.\nThey encounter every day people who have been battered by life and living, people often daunted and desperate but deserving, the sisters believe, of dignity and a glimmer of hope.\nMany who are homeless or penniless, many who are seeking refuge or a warm coat, have walked tentatively through the door at the Butte Salvation Army Service Center. From experiences elsewhere, some anticipate the scorn, rejection or worse often accompanying interactions with the larger world.\nTracey, left, and her identical sister Tina Morin stand for a portrait on Tuesday, Feb. 27, 2024 at the Butte Salvation Army Service Center, where the sisters work as the director of social services and the director of the organization, respectively.\nJOSEPH SCHELLER, The Montana Standard Tina Morin is director of The Salvation Army’s service center in Butte.\n“Don’t judge. That’s The Salvation Army approach to things,” she said. “Give people as much help as you can.”\nHer sister, Tracey Morin, works as director of social services at the center, which occupies a building off Harrison Avenue.",
