  "text": "NORFOLK, Va. — With more people in the United States traveling by train, Amtrak's top Southeast stations by ridership in 2023 were in Virginia and North Carolina, officials said. According to Amtrak, the top stations were Richmond – Staples Mill Road (424,617 passengers); Alexandria, Virginia (327,285 passengers); Charlotte, North Carolina (281,220 passengers); Norfolk, Virginia (232,530 passengers); and Raleigh, North Carolina (231,229 passengers). In Virginia, Amtrak has 12 daily trains to the Richmond station for service to Washington, D.C., Baltimore, New York, and Boston. Amtrak also serves Newport News, Roanoke and 12 other places across Virginia. Amtrak service in Virginia saw a ridership record of more than 1.3 million passengers in 2023, officials said. RELATED: Proposed Raleigh to Richmond Amtrak Route gets $1B federal grant; more funding heads to other Virginia, N.C. rail projects In North Carolina, the Piedmont and Carolinian services offer daily roundtrip rides between Raleigh, Charlotte, and places in between. “The tremendous growth in ridership is a result of the substantial investments North Carolina and Virginia are making to expand and improve passenger rail,” Amtrak Vice President Ray Lang wrote in a news release. “Customers are taking advantage of a sustainable way to travel to the many destinations our network offers.” For more information about Amtrak's service, visit the service's website.",
