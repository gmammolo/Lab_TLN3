  "text": "Gombe State Governor, Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya, has donated two Toyota Hilux patrol vehicles to the Professional Hunters Association of Nigeria (PROHAN) to boost efforts against kidnapping, cattle rustling, and other crimes.\nThe donation was approved in recognition of the association’s role in supporting security operations, particularly in remote and vulnerable communities across the state.\nOfficials said the vehicles would enhance the mobility and response capacity of the hunters, enabling them to reach distressed areas quickly and work more effectively with conventional security agencies.\nThe intervention reflects the state government’s commitment to strengthening community-based security structures as part of its broader strategy to protect lives and property.\nSpeaking on behalf of the association, Gombe State PROHAN leader, Rabi’u Baushe (Baushen Gombe), expressed appreciation to Governor Inuwa Yahaya for the support.\nHe described the gesture as timely and morale-boosting, assuring the governor that the hunters would intensify their efforts to safeguard communities.\nBaushe added that the association would continue to collaborate with the state government and security agencies to ensure lasting peace and stability in Gombe State.",
