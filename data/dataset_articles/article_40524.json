  "text": "[Riana Robinson: Top Tips For Magic Mile](https://bernews.com/2024/02/swd-ask-riana-top-tips-magic-mile/) [Written by [Stephen Wright](https://bernews.com/tag/stephenwrightreports/)] Riana Robinson, a Bermuda Pacers Track Club athlete, has shared her top tips for the boys and girls competing in the Skyport Magic Mile at the Flora Duffy Stadium on Saturday [March 2]. Among her tips for the annual iconic junior race include stretching and warming up. “What I love most about running track with Pacers is how much fun it is and how many people you meet,” Robinson told Bernews. “It’s a really good experience.” Some of the top names to have competed in the Magic Mile are Dame Flora Duffy, Dage Minors, Tre Houston, Juma Mouchette, Kyle Webb, Ryan Outerbridge, Khazi Sealey, Trey Simons, Allison Outerbridge, Alexis Bean and Kyrah Scraders. The ever-popular event starts at noon and is open for boys and girls aged 4 to 15. The 4 to 5-year-old boys and girls will run one lap of the track; the 6 to 7-year-old boys and girls will run two laps; the 8 to 9-year-old boys and girls will run three laps; and all other age groups will run four laps. Awards, including free T-shirts for all competitors, will be presented at the end of each race. Race numbers can be collected from 10 am to 3 pm at the stadium on race day. Registration, costing $15 plus, is open until midnight on Friday, March 1. Skyport Magic Mile. Click here to sign up.",
