I took two crosstown buses in New York City to get to school. My mom had no idea where I was, and I can’t even imagine what that must’ve been like for her.” The Buffy the Vampire Slayer alum shares daughter Charlotte, 14, and son Rocky, 11, with her husband of nearly 22 years, Freddie Prinze Jr. The pair set strict rules for their kids when it comes to internet access and their devices, but that doesn’t mean just restricting screen time as a whole. “Look, we had rain for five days.

Though Gellar can control the devices she buys for their kids, she can’t control other kids and their phones — which can lead to some awkward situations. Gellar was shocked when one of Rocky’s friends with a phone once showed him something on the internet about her. ‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer’ Cast: Where Are They Now? “It was actually my son one day who came home and said, oh, so-and-so has a phone or something. They looked it up and we had to explain that you can’t do that,” she recalled, adding that the school has some protections in place. “A lot of the school computers in the lower school, you actually can’t look up a lot of … Join the flipboard community Discover, collect, and share stories for all your interests [Sign up](/signup) More stories from [Hays County](/topic/hayscounty) [Construction boomed in Austin and rents went down.
