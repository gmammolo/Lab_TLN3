  "text": "VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — There's an extra day in February this year. You’ve probably learned by now that because of math and how the earth orbits, Feb. 29 is known as a leap day. It typically happens every four years, so this bonus day is a rare opportunity to celebrate a February 29th birthday or anniversary. Kerry and Craig Holgate from Virginia Beach were married on Feb. 29, 2020, which means 2024 is the first time they’ve been able to celebrate on that date since the wedding. “Honestly, I wanted to get married in March, but our venue was booked,” Kerry told 13News Now. The Holgates are celebrating the milestone with a trip to Anna Maria Island, Florida for the week. “It’s unique and not many people have it, and the fact that it fell on a Saturday,” Kerry said. The timing was right also, not knowing everything was about to change just two weeks after their wedding. “We got lucky,” Craig told 13News Now. “Everything shut down with COVID.” Now, with a two-year-old daughter, Penelope, the Holgates use this unique union to their advantage: a little leap day leeway for all of those 28-day Februarys. “If somebody forgets and doesn’t have a card, we have a bonus day!” Kerry said. The Holgates plan to make traveling on their official wedding anniversary a leap day tradition.",
