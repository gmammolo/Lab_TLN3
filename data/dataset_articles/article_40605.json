  "text": "NEWCASTLE — Following recruiting challenges, the Wyoming Department of Corrections shortened its hiring process and reduced its physical requirements for correctional officers. It also raised the salaries for correctional officers. Weston County law enforcement officials have concerns about the changes. According to a news release issued by the WDOC in January, the number of full-time staff in correctional occupations has decreased by more than 10% since 2019. Correctional occupations include correctional officers, administrative staff and probation and parole agents. In response, the department adjusted its hiring process for officers, the WDOC release said. Previously, the process took roughly two or three months, because it included all testing requirements from the Peace Officer Standards and Training certification process and federal Prison Rape Elimination Act. The length of the hiring process commonly caused applicants to drop off and begin work elsewhere because applicants commonly chose to start other jobs instead. Stephanie Kiger, the WDOC public information officer, said in an email on Feb. 12 that there were seven correctional officer academy attendees at the Wyoming Honor Conservation Camp in January, compared with none in January 2023. There were three applications for the WHCC in December 2023, as of Dec. 27, compared with none in December 2022. WDOC is now making conditional offers of employment before background checks and physical testing are complete, which is also speeding up the hiring process, he said. The release said that correctional officer applications throughout the agency have increased across the agency. In the last three months of 2022, the WDOC received 19 applications. Over the course of those same calendar months in 2023, the department received 119 applications. “While there is still a large number of vacancies, these changes are enabling the WDOC to fill and train new staff at a rate which in turn benefits the inmates, and the agency alike,” the release said. The WDOC has also raised the starting pay for correctional officers from $20.66 to $25.26, the release said. “This new figure brings the WDOC more aligned with our peer organizations,” the release said. Todd Martin, the WHCC warden, said in a phone interview on Feb. 13 that the department has struggled to find staff, largely because the wages weren’t competitive with railroad and oil and coal industry jobs, as well as other law enforcement jobs. Hiring has increased since the raise. Before the raise, he routinely had 15 to 20 staff vacancies at the camp, he said. Presently, there are six or seven vacancies, with 96 now working at the facility. The state of the economy is contributing to raising the applicant counts as well, according to Martin. Federal funding that supported people who may have otherwise worked is running out in a lot of areas, prompting people to seek employment. “Things are actually looking up for us, and I attribute most of that to the hard work our director’s done to get those salaries to a level where we’re competitive again,” he said. The quality of life that Wyoming offers, with low crime rates and extensive outdoor recreation opportunities, is drawing people, and candidates, to the area, Martin said. Weston County sheriff finds changes ‘somewhat irritating’ Weston County Sheriff Bryan Colvard said in a phone interview on Feb. 21 that one of the biggest problems about the WDOC’s changes is the boost in starting pay because he doesn’t anticipate that the department will be able to keep up with it. The WDOC and Weston County Sheriff’s Office offer similar benefits. The Weston County website, on Feb. 26, said that the beginning wage for a detention officer is $18.92. After completing academy training, the officers earn $21.22 an hour. The change in physical standards is “kind of a convoluted mess,” Colvard said. The state requires him to mandate that deputies attend the Wyoming Law Enforcement Academy in Douglas to receive their Detention Officer Basic certification. The academy, not Colvard, sets the physical fitness standards for that certification. Meanwhile, WDOC can have its own academy, he said. “If somebody can’t make the standards for the Wyoming Law Enforcement Academy, they just go to the camp and get a job up there for $5 more,” Colvard said. He said the Weston County Sheriff’s Office has seen a decrease in hiring due to the difference between the county’s starting pay and physical requirements and those of the WDOC. He did not provide hiring numbers by press deadline. Newcastle police chief responds Newcastle Police Chief Derek Thompson said in an email on Feb. 24 that the department has experienced some difficulty in drawing qualified candidates to fill peace officer positions. While thankful that the department has been able to hire five officers in the past year who were qualified for the position, he said, the department still needs another officer and has only received one application for the position. “At the most, we usually have two applicants at a time for the recent positions we have filled. … I cannot really speak to how many applicants this department has had in the past because I have only been here for slightly over a year,” Thompson said. He said that he doesn’t believe the department will change its hiring policies because it would need state-level changes to make any significant adjustments. The Wyoming Peace Officer Standards and Training sets the standards and requirements for hiring and training of peace officers, correctional officers, detention officers, dispatchers and coroners. “I understand why the Department of Corrections is doing what they are doing. They are a large agency that has a significant amount of influence at the state level and can effect change much more seamlessly than an agency of our size ever could. They have to do what they have to do to draw sufficient staff to operate their facilities,” Thompson said. “I don’t think anyone likes the idea of lowering standards, but it appears it has come to the point where it is a necessary evil for them. Because WDOC has a facility in our area, we are going to feel the added strain in drawing candidates to our department. When a person interested in the public safety field can go up the hill and make more money with less stringent entry requirements, it will make it more difficult for local agencies to compete for the interest of those candidates.” The department might have to consider raising wages to recruit and retain personnel since, as with everything else, the cost of public safety is increasing, Thompson said. “No one wants any more tax increases, so it will take some brainstorming to come up with ways to keep the staff all agencies need, with the least possible burden to the taxpayers,” he said. “It is frustrating and difficult to do all of the work required without sufficient staff. One thing I have noticed is this is a problem that plagues many industries, not just those of us in public safety. Everyone is feeling the strain and there doesn’t seem to be a real clear solution to the problem.” Upton’s hiring, with different challenges Upton Police Chief Susan Bridge said in an email on Feb. 24 that the department has not had any openings for officers in nearly seven years, but a longtime officer is retiring, and she anticipates the department will face hiring challenges soon. Employees must live within 5 miles of the town limits, and it is difficult to find housing. Smaller departments, like Upton’s, also require substantial on-call time, she said. “This prohibits the officer from leaving town or getting involved in projects or social events, as they have to be ready to respond to calls after they have completed their designated shift,” she said. A police officer in a small department may be on duty for a 24-hour period, with nobody available to answer questions or provide clarification, Bridge said. “In smaller departments, we need to take more time and training for our officers for their safety and the safety of the public,” she said.
