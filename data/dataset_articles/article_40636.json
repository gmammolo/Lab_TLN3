  "text": "2024-02-29 22:52:18\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog said that he is “trying to help” in resolving the emerging differences between the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and the Israeli public broadcasting corporation Kan, as he “considers it important for the Jewish state to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2024,” Day.Az reports. with reference to TASS.\n“I try to help as much as I can, I think it is important that Israel participates in Eurovision, because it is a platform for hundreds of millions of viewers,” Herzog said at a conference of the Basheva newspaper in Jerusalem. “I think it’s positive that the Kan corporation is conducting a dialogue with the EBU. It’s important to have a dialogue,” the Israeli President emphasized, whose statement was quoted by the Ynet portal. “Being smart doesn’t just mean being right,” added the head of the Jewish state.\nOn the night of February 23, Israel’s Kan Corporation announced that it would not enter a new song into the Eurovision Song Contest if the EBU disqualifies “October Rain” due to the fact that it is overly politicized amid fighting in the sector. Gaza. Earlier, the EBU told TASS that the organization is checking whether the text of the song that Israeli representative Eden Golan is going to perform at the competition complies with the rules of the competition.\n“This process (checking the song – TASS note) is confidential between the EBU and the television company [Kan] until a final decision is made,” the EBU press service noted. As previously reported by Reuters, the leaked text of the song October Rain, which Golan intends to perform, contains words that can be interpreted as a hint to the hiding in the shelters of Israelis during the attack on Israel by militants of the radical Palestinian movement Hamas on October 7 last year. We are talking about the following lines: “They were all good children” and “There was no air left to breathe.”\nThe EBU explained that “all broadcasters have until March 11 to formally submit their applications.” “If a song is considered unacceptable for any reason, broadcasters are given the opportunity to propose a new song or new lyrics in accordance with the rules of the competition,” the organization noted. Disagreements between Eurovision organizers and the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation over the choice of song could lead to Israel losing its place in the upcoming song contest or refusing to participate in it in 2024, The Times of Israel newspaper notes. At the same time, on February 15, the EBU rejected the idea of excluding Israel from the list of Eurovision participants, citing the fact that the competition is a musical event outside of politics and a competition between national broadcasters that are members of the EBU. Calls to exclude Israel from the competition came from a number of countries after the outbreak of hostilities in the Gaza Strip.\nEurovision is an international pop song competition that has been held since 1956 among member countries of the European Broadcasting Union. Currently, the EMU includes more than 110 companies from more than 50 countries, mainly European. Broadcasts of the annual Eurovision Song Contest attract an audience of about 180 million viewers. Eurovision 2024 will take place in Malmo, Sweden on May 7, 9 and 11.\nSubscribe to our WhatsApp channel and stay up to date with the main news!",
