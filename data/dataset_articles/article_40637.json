  "text": "Disney is hacking the grid to give fans their first look at \"TRON: Ares.\" Jared Leto took to Instagram on Feb. 29 to share a photo of a character from the film wearing a black suit featuring red lights. \"ARE YOU READY??\" the Oscar-winning actor and Thirty Seconds To Mars frontman wrote, revealing that \"TRON: Ares\" comes out in 2025. \"See you on the grid… 🥏,\" he added. \"Tron: Ares,\" directed by Joachim Rønning, began production in Vancouver in January. It will be the third installment in the \"Tron\" franchise, following the 1982 original and the 2010 sequel, \"Tron: Legacy.\" According to a press release, the film centers around a highly sophisticated Program, Ares, who is sent from the digital world into the real world on a dangerous mission, marking humankind's first encounter with A.I. beings.\" Joining Leto in the cast are Greta Lee, Evan Peters, Hasan Minhaj, Jodie Turner-Smith, Arturo Castro, Cameron Monaghan and Gillian Anderson. \"I'm excited to be part of the TRON franchise and bring this new film to fans around the world,\" Rønning said in a statement. \"TRON: Ares\" builds upon the legacy of cutting-edge design, technology and storytelling. Now more than ever, it feels like the right time to return to the Grid.\"",
