  "text": "Refreshing to read about IVF from a male point of view: Zach Baron in GQ on “\nMy IVF Years.”\nRefreshing to read about IVF from a male point of view: Zach Baron in GQ on “\nMy IVF Years.”\nI think men should absolutely be writing about their IVF experiences but I found this essay to be so abstract and seemingly so barely familiar with the impact of the Alabama ruling as to be somehow from another time and place than the world we're inhabiting currently. Aside from one scant reference to the ruling, this could have been written a decade (or more) ago.\nHello! In order to leave a comment, you need to be a current kottke.org member.
