  "text": "Award-winning actor\nGary Sinise, who is well known for his roles in “Forrest Gump,” “Apollo 13,” and “Truman,” posted a moving tribute to his son Mac, who died from a rare spinal cancer called chordoma on Jan. 5 at the age of 33.\nSinise, who played the father of contemporary Christian music (CCM) singer-songwriter Jeremy Camp in the\nErwin Brothers‘ film “ I Still Believe,” referenced his faith in his tribute to his son.\n“Like any family experiencing such a loss, we are heartbroken and have been managing as best we can,” Sinise said. “As parents, it is so difficult losing a child. My heart goes out to all who have suffered a similar loss, and to anyone who has lost a loved one.”\nMac’s battle with\ncancer lasted over five years, a fight that Sinise described as “more and more challenging as time went on.”\nRELATED:\n‘I Still Believe’ Brings You the Incredible Love Story Behind Jeremy Camp’s Hit Song\n“While our hearts ache at missing him, we are comforted in knowing that Mac is no longer struggling, and inspired and moved by how he managed it,” the actor added. “He fought an uphill battle against a cancer that has no cure, but he never quit trying.”\nSinise said, “I am so blessed, fortunate, and proud to be his dad.”\nMac worked at his father’s foundation as the Assistant Manager of Education and Outreach, and although his cancer paralyzed him from the chest down, he used his limited mobility to continue serving wounded veterans of the military.\nMac also recorded an album titled “Resurrection & Revival.” The album was a passion project of Mac’s and was finished in the last year of his life.\nRELATED:\nToby Keith, Whose Faith Was His ‘Rock,’ Passes Away From Cancer At Age 62\nThe week his album went to press, he lost his battle to cancer.",
