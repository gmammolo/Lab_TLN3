  "text": "CONCORD, N.C. — Being in victory lane is a different feeling for Billy Venturini than being honored on stage at the NASCAR Drive for Diversity Awards .\n“We’ve had a lot of success here and it has been a good run for us, but that’s a little different. Because more of a macro effect on the sport,” Venturini said.\nVenturini is the General Manager and Owner of Venturini Motorsports . He says the macro effect is helping shape the future of NASCAR and ARCA Menards Racing.\n“I grew up in the sport. It’s kind of like being a third-generation farmer. Well, it’s just I’m a third-generation racer and I know how to race,” Venturini explained.\nThe drive to be a racer starts with Billy’s grandfather Tony Venturini.\n“He raced more locally, but around the Chicago area. That’s where I grew up and that’s where my family is from,” Billy said.\nIn the 1950s Tony began racing stock cars at Soldier Field. His son, Bill Venturini Sr. followed in his footsteps. He started Venturini Motorsports.\nIn the early 90’s the former NASCAR driver and two-time ARCA Racing Series champion would move the team to the Charlotte area.\nEventually, he handed the keys over to his son, Billy.\n“I took over the team, which is now the development program here,” Billy Venturini shared.\nHe said it was a lack of finances that steered the team in that direction. However, developing a diverse and inclusive team started years prior.\nAn all-female pit crew led by his mom, Cathy, helped his father Bill Sr. win his first ARCA championship in 1987.\n“It was Dad’s idea, but Mom made it all happen,” Billy Venturini said.\nFast forward to today, Billy Venturini said his team is made up of people from different backgrounds and cultures.\n“My goal was to put together the best people I could put together on my race team,\" Billy Venturini said. \"I just wasn’t going to exclude anyone if they came from a different background. They didn’t have to be a bunch of white guys.”\nThis brings us back to the Drive for Diversity Awards.\nOn Feb. 2nd, Venturini Motorsports was among the honorees at the 16th annual showcase in Los Angeles.\n“I’ve seen a lot, and a lot has changed. And it’s still changing,” Billy Venturini said.",
