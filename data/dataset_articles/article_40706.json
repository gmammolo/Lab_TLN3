  "text": "NEEDHAM, Mass. (WHDH) – A woman in Massachusetts is celebrating her 113th birthday.\nThe reason she gave for making it so long may be surprising.\nAt 113 years old, Herlda Senhouse may be the oldest resident in Massachusetts.\nThe centenarian was born the same year as Lucille Ball and Ronald Reagan. The president at the time was William Howard Taft. It was also the year construction began on Fenway Park in Boston.\nDuring her birthday celebration, Senhouse was surrounded by loved ones at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital in Needham. She was honored with a special cane given to the oldest resident of her hometown in Wellesley.\nSenhouse’s friend, Margaret Robinson, was there to help celebrate.\n“She’s a lovely person and very kind, very giving, very inspirational, absolutely a wonderful person,” Robinson said.\nSenhouse was born in West Virginia before she moved to Massachusetts at a young age.\n“I’m so happy. It’s awesome,” she said.\nA fan of the slot machines, Senhouse said she is looking forward to her next trip to the casino.\nSenhouse said she credits living a more stress-free life as the reason for her longevity.\n“I didn’t have children,” she said.\nCopyright 2024 WHDH via CNN Newsource.
