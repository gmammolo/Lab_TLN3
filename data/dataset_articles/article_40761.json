  "text": "All financial figures are in Canadian dollars ($ or C$) and all references to barrels are per barrel of bitumen unless otherwise noted. The Corporation's Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures are detailed in the Advisory section of this news release. They include: cash operating netback, bitumen realization net of transportation and storage expense, operating expenses net of power revenue, energy operating costs net of power revenue, non-energy operating costs, energy operating costs, adjusted funds flow, free cash flow and net debt.\nCALGARY, AB , Feb. 29, 2024 /CNW/ - MEG Energy Corp. (TSX:MEG) (\"MEG\" or the \"Corporation\") reported its full year 2023 operational and financial results.\n\"I am extremely proud of MEG's safety, operating, and financial performance in 2023\", said Derek Evans\n, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Annual production grew by 6%, averaging over 100,000 barrels per day for the first time and exiting the year at approximately 110,000 barrels per day. MEG's financial performance was also strong generating nearly $1 billion of free cash flow for debt repayment and share buybacks. At current prices MEG is well positioned to achieve US$600 million net debt in the third quarter of 2024, after which 100% of free cash flow will be returned to shareholders.\" Highlights include:\nAnnual free cash flow (\"FCF\") of $953 million used to repay $437 million of debt and return $446 million of capital to shareholders through the repurchase and cancellation of 19.0 million shares at a weighted average price of $23.54 per share. FCF of $254 million in the fourth quarter was used to repay $173 million of debt and repurchase 8.7 million shares at a weighted average price of $25.29 per share, returning $219 million to shareholders; The Corporation exited 2023 with net debt of US$730 million ( $1.0 billion ); Annual bitumen production of 101,425 barrels per day (\"bbls/d\") at a 2.27 steam-oil ratio (\"SOR\"), representing a 6% increase in production and a 4% decrease in SOR from 2022. Fourth quarter bitumen production averaged 109,112 bbls/d at a 2.28 SOR; Annual funds flow from operating activities (\"FFO\") and adjusted funds flow (\"AFF\") of $1,476 million and $1,402 million , or $5.13 and $4.87 per share, respectively. FFO and AFF totaled $358 million , or $1.27 per share, during the fourth quarter; Annual capital expenditures of $449 million and fourth quarter capital expenditures of $104 million were focused on sustaining and maintenance activities; Operating expenses net of power revenue declined 25% in 2023 to $5.96 per barrel, including $5.01 per barrel of non-energy operating costs and $0.95 per barrel of energy operating costs net of power revenue. Fourth quarter 2023 operating expenses net of power revenue rose 5% from the comparable 2022 quarter to $6.10 per barrel, including $4.64 per barrel of non-energy operating costs and $1.46 per barrel of energy operating costs net of power revenue; and Intended renewal of the Corporation's normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") for a one-year period upon its expiration on March 9, 2024 , which will allow the repurchase of an additional 10% of MEG's public float 1 .\n1 As defined by the Toronto Stock Exchange\nThree months ended December 31\nYear ended December 31\n($millions, except as indicated)\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nOperational results:\nBitumen production - bbls/d\n109,112\n110,805\n101,425\n95,338\nSteam-oil ratio\n2.28\n2.22\n2.27\n2.36\nBitumen sales - bbls/d\n112,634\n113,582\n101,086\n95,691\nBenchmark pricing:\nWTI - US$/bbl\n78.32\n82.65\n77.62\n94.23\nDifferential - WTI:AWB - Edmonton - US$/bbl\n(23.79)\n(29.14)\n(20.79)\n(20.64)\nAWB - Edmonton - US$/bbl\n54.53\n53.51\n56.83\n73.59\nDifferential - WTI:AWB - USGC - US$/bbl\n(7.43)\n(16.35)\n(8.72)\n(9.62)\nAWB - USGC - US$/bbl\n70.89\n66.30\n68.90\n84.61\nFinancial results:\nBitumen realization after net transportation\nand storage expense (1) - $/bbl\n63.52\n54.75\n62.46\n76.66\nNon-energy operating costs (2) - $/bbl\n4.64\n4.34\n5.01\n4.73\nEnergy operating costs net of power\nrevenue (1) - $/bbl\n1.46\n1.49\n0.95\n3.18\nOperating expenses net of power revenue -\n$/bbl\n6.10\n5.83\n5.96\n7.91\nCash operating netback (1) - $/bbl\n38.65\n43.89\n43.36\n62.61\nGeneral & administrative expense -\n$/bbl of bitumen production\n1.89\n1.62\n1.86\n1.78\nFunds flow from operating activities\n358\n383\n1,476\n1,882\nPer share, diluted\n1.27\n1.28\n5.13\n6.09\nAdjusted funds flow (3)\n358\n401\n1,402\n1,934\nPer share, diluted (3)\n1.27\n1.34\n4.87\n6.26\nCapital expenditures\n104\n106\n449\n376\nFree cash flow (3)\n254\n295\n953\n1,558\nDebt repayments - US$\n128\n150\n322\n1,016\nShare repurchases - C$\n219\n196\n446\n382\nRevenues\n1,444\n1,445\n5,653\n6,118\nNet earnings\n103\n159\n569\n902\nPer share, diluted\n0.37\n0.53\n1.98\n2.92\nLong-term debt, including current portion\n1,124\n1,581\n1,124\n1,581\nNet debt - US$ (3)\n730\n1,026\n730\n1,026\n(1)\nNon-GAAP financial measure - please refer to the Advisory section of this news release.\n(2)\nSupplementary financial measure - please refer to the Advisory section of this news release.\n(3)\nCapital management measure - please refer to the Advisory section of this news release.\nFourth Quarter Results\nFCF of $254 million was used to repay US$128 million ( $173 million ) of debt and repurchase 8.7 million shares, returning $219 million to shareholders.\nAverage bitumen production of 109,112 bbls/d was similar to 110,805 bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2022 reflecting stable operations and no significant maintenance activity in both periods.\nAFF decreased to $358 million , or $1.27 per share, from $401 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting a 12% decline in the cash operating netback.\nThe lower cash operating netback reflects increased royalty expense, the result of reaching payout status in the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by a higher bitumen realization due to narrower WTI:AWB differentials and lower diluent expense.\nAnnual Financial Results\nAFF decreased to $1,402 million , or $4.87 per share, in 2023 from $1,934 million , or $6.26 per share, in 2022 driven by a lower cash operating netback partially offset by lower interest expense. The 31% decline in the cash operating netback for 2023 reflects a lower bitumen realization after net transportation and storage expense and higher royalties, the result of reaching payout status.\nBitumen realization after net transportation and storage expense decreased to $62.46 per barrel in 2023, from $76.66 per barrel in 2022, primarily driven by a lower average WTI benchmark price partially offset by the realized price improvement from MEG's strategic market access and marketing optimization activities.\nThe Corporation sold 66% of blend sales volumes in the U.S. Gulf Coast during both 2023 and 2022 and average heavy oil apportionment on the Enbridge mainline system was 9% and 5%, respectively, in those years.\nFCF totaled $953 million in 2023, compared to $1,558 million in 2022, reflecting lower AFF and higher capital spending.\nAnnual capital expenditures of $449 million were in line with guidance and rose from $376 million in 2022 due to increased scope, inflation and timing of field development and maintenance work. Spending in both years focused on sustaining and maintenance activities.\nNet earnings declined to $569 million in 2023 from $902 million in 2022 primarily driven by a lower cash operating netback, higher depletion and depreciation expense and an onerous contract expense. These were partially offset by an unrealized foreign exchange gain on long-term debt and reduced interest and income tax expenses.\nAnnual Operating Results\nAnnual bitumen production in 2023 rose 6% to 101,425 bbls/d at a 2.27 SOR from 95,338 bbls/d at a 2.36 SOR in 2022. The production increase and improved SOR reflects a continued focus on short-cycle redevelopment programs, enhanced completion designs, optimized well spacing and targeted facility enhancements. Production was impacted by major planned turnaround activities at the Christina Lake Facility in both years.\nNon‐energy operating costs averaged $5.01 per barrel of bitumen sales in 2023, in line with guidance and representing a 6% increase from 2022 despite inflationary pressures on the cost of services, treating chemicals and staff.\nEnergy operating costs net of power revenue decreased to $0.95 per barrel in 2023 from $3.18 per barrel in 2022 as weaker natural gas prices more than offset reduced power revenue. Revenue from the sale of excess power generated by the Corporation's cogeneration facilities offset 76% and 56% of energy operating costs in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAnnual Debt Repayment and Share Repurchases\nThe $953 million of 2023 FCF was used to repay debt, return capital to shareholders and fund working capital requirements. The Corporation repaid US$322 million (approximately $437 million ) of outstanding 7.125% senior unsecured notes at a weighted average price of 101.7% and returned $446 million to shareholders through the repurchase and cancellation of 19.0 million shares at a weighted average price of $23.54 per share, approximately 7% of MEG's December 31, 2022 issued and outstanding shares.\nCapital Allocation Strategy\nApproximately 50% of FCF was allocated to debt repayment in 2023 with the remainder applied to share repurchases. 100% of FCF will be returned to shareholders when the Corporation reaches its US$600 million net debt target, which is anticipated to occur in the third quarter of 2024 assuming a US$75 per barrel WTI price. The Corporation exited 2023 with net debt of US$730 million (approximately $1.0 billion ).\nThe Corporation intends to renew the current NCIB for a one-year period upon its expiration on March 9, 2024 , which will allow the repurchase of an additional 10% of MEG's public float.\nSustainability and Pathways Update\nThe Corporation published its third ESG report in September 2023 , which discusses its foundational commitments of Business Model Resilience and Governance and the Corporation's priority ESG topics: Health and Safety; Climate Change and GHG Emissions; Water Management; Energy Security; Energy Affordability; and Indigenous Relations. The ESG report illustrates progress in several areas, including the establishment of a new mid-term absolute GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) reduction target of 0.63 megatonnes per year by year-end 2030 (which represents approximately 30% of the Corporation's 2019 GHG emissions); $72 million spent on goods and services provided by Indigenous businesses in 2022 (a 30% increase over 2021); the launch of the Corporation's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion education and awareness campaign focused on ensuring that every team member is valued, respected and heard to enhance decision making, innovation, employee engagement and the Corporation's long-term success; and the continued advancement of the Corporation's safety management programs and systems to ensure safe, sustainable and reliable operations.\nMEG, along with its Pathways Alliance peers, continues to progress pre-work on the proposed foundational carbon capture and storage (\"CCS\") project, which will transport CO 2 via pipeline from multiple oil sands facilities to be stored safely and permanently underground in the Cold Lake region of Alberta . The Pathways Alliance continues to advance detailed evaluations of the proposed carbon storage hub and is working to obtain a carbon sequestration agreement from the Alberta Government in the first half of 2024 to support regulatory submissions. In addition, the Pathways Alliance continues to advance engineering work, environmental field programs to minimize the project's environmental disturbance, and consultations with Indigenous and local communities along the proposed CO 2 transportation and storage network corridor. The Pathways Alliance continues to work collaboratively with both the federal and Alberta Governments on the necessary policy and co-financing frameworks required to move the project forward. The federal government has proposed an investment tax credit (\"ITC\") for CCS projects for all sectors across Canada and introduced implementing legislation for the CCS ITC in November 2023 . In addition, the Alberta Government announced an Alberta Carbon Capture Incentive Program (\"ACCIP\") which aims to help hard-to-abate industries by providing a grant of 12% for new eligible CCS capital costs. The Pathways Alliance is evaluating these proposals and will continue to work with the federal and Alberta Governments to secure the required financial support and regulatory certainty to enable the CCS project to proceed.\nAdditional information regarding the Corporation's ESG actions, including the Corporation's 2023 ESG Report, is available in the \"Sustainability\" section of the Corporation's website at www.megenergy.com. The Corporation's ESG Report and contents of MEG's website are expressly not incorporated by reference in this news release.\n2024 Guidance\nSummary of 2024 Guidance\nBitumen production - annual average\n102,000 to 108,000 bbls/d\nCapital expenditures\n$550 million\nNon-energy operating costs\n$5.10 to $5.40 per bbl\nG&A expense\n$1.75 to $1.95 per bbl\nThe 2024 annual production estimate incorporates reduced turnaround activities spread evenly throughout the year. The plan also includes the startup of two well pads, with the first pad on-stream mid-year and the second in the fourth quarter. New pad activity supports the 2024 production estimate and builds well capacity for future growth.\nThe Corporation's 2024 capital expenditure program will allocate $450 million to sustaining activities and $100 million towards multi-year productive capacity growth. The growth investment reflects the commencement of a three-year project with an estimated total cost of approximately $300 million forecasted to deliver incremental productive capacity around the end of 2026.\nThe Corporation's balance sheet and operating performance provide a solid foundation to fund the 2024 capital expenditure program. As a result, no WTI or WTI:WCS differential risk management contracts have been entered into for 2024.\nAdjusted Funds Flow Sensitivity\nMEG's production is comprised entirely of crude oil and AFF is highly correlated with crude oil benchmark prices and light-heavy oil differentials. The following table provides an annual sensitivity estimate to the most significant market variables.\nVariable\nRange\n2024 AFF Sensitivity (1)(2) - C$mm\nWCS Differential (US$/bbl)\n+/- US$1.00 /bbl\n+/- C$47mm\nWTI (US$/bbl)\n+/- US$1.00 /bbl\n+/- C$31mm\nBitumen Production (bbls/d)\n+/- 1,000 bbls/d\n+/- C$16mm\nCondensate (US$/bbl)\n+/- US$1.00 /bbl\n+/- C$14mm\nExchange Rate (C$/US$)\n+/- $0.01\n+/- C$10mm\nNon-Energy Opex (C$/bbl)\n+/- C$0.25 /bbl\n+/- C$6mm\nAECO Gas (3) (C$/GJ)\n+/- C$0.50 /GJ\n+/- C$6mm\n(1)\nEach sensitivity is independent of changes to other variables.\n(2)\nAssumes mid point of 2024 production guidance, US$75.00 /bbl WTI, US$16.25 /bbl WTI:WCS Edmonton discount, US$1.50 /bbl WCS:AWB Edmonton discount, US$7.75 /bbl WTI: AWB Gulf Coast discount, C$1.35 /US$ F/X rate, condensate purchased at 100% of WTI and one bbl of bitumen per 1.42 bbls of blend sales (1.42 blend ratio).\n(3)\nAssumes 1.4 GJ/bbl of bitumen, 65% of 160 MW of power generation sold externally and a 25.0 GJ/MWh heat rate.\nConference Call\nA conference call will be held to review MEG's 2023 annual operating and financial results at 6:30 a.m. Mountain Time ( 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time ) on March 1, 2024 . To participate, please dial the North American toll-free number 1-888-390-0546, or the international call number 1-416-764-8688.\nA recording of the call will be available by 12 p.m. Mountain Time ( 2 p.m. Eastern Time ) on the same day at https://www.megenergy.com/investors/presentations-events/ .\nADVISORY\nBasis of Presentation\nMEG prepares its financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IFRS Accounting Standards\") and presents financial results in Canadian dollars ($ or C$), which is the Corporation's functional currency.\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\nCertain financial measures in this news release are non-GAAP financial measures or ratios, supplementary financial measures and capital management measures. These measures are not defined by IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. These non-GAAP and other financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nAdjusted Funds Flow and Free Cash Flow\nAdjusted funds flow and free cash flow are capital management measures and are defined in the Corporation's consolidated financial statements. Adjusted funds flow and free cash flow are presented to assist management and investors in analyzing operating performance and cash flow generating ability. Funds flow from operating activities is an IFRS measure in the Corporation's consolidated statement of cash flow. Adjusted funds flow is calculated as funds flow from operating activities excluding items not considered part of ordinary continuing operating results. By excluding non-recurring adjustments, the adjusted funds flow measure provides a meaningful metric for management and investors by establishing a clear link between the Corporation's cash flows and cash operating netback. Free cash flow is presented to assist management and investors in analyzing performance by the Corporation as a measure of financial liquidity and the capacity of the business to repay debt and return capital to shareholders. Free cash flow is calculated as adjusted funds flow less capital expenditures.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, an adjustment was made to the presentation of adjusted funds flow and free cash flow. In April 2020 , the Corporation issued cash-settled RSUs under its long-term incentive (\"LTI\") plan when the share price was at a historic low of $1.57 per share. Concurrent with the issuance, the Corporation entered equity price risk management contracts to manage share price volatility in the subsequent three-year period, effectively reducing share price appreciation cash flow risk. The increase in the Corporation's share price from April 2020 to June 30, 2022 resulted in the recognition of a significant cash-settled stock-based compensation expense, which was previously included as a component of adjusted funds flow and free cash flow. The actual cash impact of the 2020 cash-settled RSUs, however, was subject to equity price risk management contracts, so the cash impact over the term of these RSUs was reduced and the change in value did not provide a valuable indication of operating performance.\nTherefore, the financial statement impacts of the April 2020 cash-settled stock-based compensation and the equity price risk management contracts were excluded from adjusted funds flow and free cash flow. All prior periods presented have been adjusted to reflect this change in presentation.\nThe following table reconciles FFO to AFF to FCF:\nThree months ended December 31\nYear ended December 31\n($millions)\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nFunds flow from operating activities\n$ 358\n$ 383\n$ 1,476\n$ 1,882\nAdjustments:\nImpact of cash-settled SBC units subject to equity price risk management\n—\n18\n13\n98\nRealized equity price risk management gain\n—\n—\n(87)\n(46)\nAdjusted funds flow\n358\n401\n1,402\n1,934\nCapital expenditures\n(104)\n(106)\n(449)\n(376)\nFree cash flow\n$ 254\n$ 295\n$ 953\n$ 1,558\nNet Debt\nNet debt is a capital management measure and is defined in the Corporation's consolidated financial statements. Net debt is an important measure used by management to analyze leverage and liquidity. Net debt is calculated as long-term debt plus current portion of long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents.\nThe following table reconciles the Corporation's current and long-term debt to net debt:\nAs at\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nLong-term debt\n$ 1,124\n$ 1,578\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n—\n3\nCash and cash equivalents\n(160)\n(192)\nNet debt - C$\n$ 964\n$ 1,389\nNet debt - US$\n$ 730\n$ 1,026\nCash Operating Netback\nCash operating netback is a non-GAAP financial measure, or ratio when expressed on a per barrel basis. Its terms are not defined by IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nCash operating netback is a financial measure widely used in the oil and gas industry as a supplemental measure of a company's efficiency and its ability to generate cash flow for debt repayment, capital expenditures, or other uses. The per barrel calculation of cash operating netback is based on bitumen sales volumes.\nRevenues is an IFRS measure in the Corporation's consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income which is the most directly comparable primary financial statement measure to cash operating netback. A reconciliation from revenues to cash operating netback has been provided below:\nThree months ended December 31\nYear ended December 31\n($millions)\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n$ 1,444\n$ 1,445\n$ 5,653\n$ 6,118\nDiluent expense\n(471)\n(505)\n(1,691)\n(1,848)\nTransportation and storage expense\n(148)\n(151)\n(600)\n(538)\nPurchased product\n(334)\n(216)\n(1,400)\n(1,135)\nOperating expenses\n(82)\n(115)\n(334)\n(420)\nRealized gain (loss) on commodity risk management\n(9)\n1\n(28)\n10\nCash operating netback\n$ 400\n$ 459\n$ 1,600\n$ 2,187\nBlend Sales and Bitumen Realization\nBlend sales and bitumen realization are non-GAAP financial measures, or ratios when expressed on a per barrel basis, and are used as a measure of the Corporation's marketing strategy by isolating petroleum revenue and costs associated with its produced and purchased products and excludes royalties. Their terms are not defined by IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Blend sales per barrel is based on blend sales volumes and bitumen realization per barrel is based on bitumen sales volumes.\nRevenues is an IFRS measure in the Corporation's consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income, which is the most directly comparable primary financial statement measure to blend sales and bitumen realization. A reconciliation from revenues to blend sales and bitumen realization has been provided below:\nThree months ended December 31\nYear ended December 31\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n($millions, except as indicated)\n$/bbl\n$/bbl\n$/bbl\n$/bbl\nRevenues\n$ 1,444\n$ 1,445\n$ 5,653\n$ 6,118\nPower and transportation revenue\n(19)\n(55)\n(117)\n(148)\nRoyalties\n186\n54\n456\n225\nPetroleum revenue\n1,611\n1,444\n5,992\n6,195\nPurchased product\n(334)\n(216)\n(1,400)\n(1,135)\nBlend sales\n1,277\n$ 87.33\n1,228\n$ 83.28\n4,592\n$ 87.94\n5,060\n$ 102.02\nDiluent expense\n(471)\n(9.58)\n(505)\n(14.12)\n(1,691)\n(9.30)\n(1,848)\n(10.07)\nBitumen realization\n$ 806\n$ 77.75\n$ 723\n$ 69.16\n$ 2,901\n$ 78.64\n$ 3,212\n$ 91.95\nNet Transportation and Storage Expense\nNet transportation and storage expense is a non-GAAP financial measure, or ratio when expressed on a per barrel basis. Its terms are not defined by IFRS and, therefore may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.

Their terms are not defined by IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Per barrel amounts are based on bitumen sales volumes.\nOperating expenses net of power revenue is used as a measure of the Corporation's cost to operate its facilities at the Christina Lake project after factoring in the benefits from selling excess power to offset energy costs.\nEnergy operating costs net of power revenue is used to measure the performance of the Corporation's cogeneration facilities to offset energy operating costs.\nNon-energy operating costs and energy operating costs are supplementary financial measures as they represent portions of operating expenses. Non-energy operating costs comprise production-related operating activities and energy operating costs reflect the cost of natural gas used as fuel to generate steam and power. Per barrel amounts are based on bitumen sales volumes.\nOperating expenses is an IFRS measure in the Corporation's consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income. Power and transportation revenue is an IFRS measure in the Corporation's consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income which is the most directly comparable primary financial statement measure to power revenue.
