  "text": "Spirit Halloween's Charitable Foundation Donates Over $46,000 to Shriners Children's Hospital On Thursday, Spirit Halloween's charitable foundation, Spirit of Children, presented $46,702 to Shriners Children's Erie. Stores in Erie, Pennsylvania, Ashtabula, Ohio and Lakewood, New York contributed their donations to benefit the Shriners Child Life Department. In addition, the donations help supply some of the toys that are used in the hospital. They are used to make children's visits less stressful and more enjoyable. The foundation also donates costumes for the hospital's trunk-or-treat event. Kristin Maguire, Child Life Specialist, says, \"at our trunk-or-treat event, and it allows us to see kids, just being kids, without the disability or without the injury, and it's just a great event for everyone.\" Next year, Spirit of Children hopes to raise over $50,000. \"We have an amazing team here in this market, and they really put everything they have into this program, it's the heart of our company, and it's the best part of our job,\" says Ashleigh Lang, Spirit Halloween's Regional Zone Manager.",
