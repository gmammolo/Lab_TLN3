  "text": "ASHEVILLE, N.C. ( WHNS /Gray News) – A junkyard employee in North Carolina saved a cat from a car about to be crushed.\nAccording to Brother Wolf Animal Rescue, an employee at the junkyard was removing the car’s battery “just moments” before it was sent to be crushed.\n“As he popped open the hood, a bundle of fur jumped out and took a blind leap of faith into his arms,” Brother Wolf Animal Rescue wrote in a Facebook post . “She looked at him with soft eyes, thanking him with slow blinks and soft purrs. It was almost like she knew that her life had been saved.”\nThe employee kept the cat bundled in his jacket for the rest of his shift before turning it over to Brother Wolf Animal Rescue, where his girlfriend works.\nA man called the junkyard very soon after, searching frantically for his cat.\nHe described his cat, Lilly, as very adventurous, who loves riding in the car or on his motorcycle with him. She even has her own helmet.\nBrother Wolf Animal Rescue confirmed Lilly was the cat that the junkyard employee had rescued.\nThe shelter offered to return Lilly to her owner vaccinated, microchipped, and spayed at no cost. He gladly accepted the offer.\nLilly and her owner were reunited and very happy to see each other.\n“She melted into his arms as his eyes filled with tears of joy,” the shelter wrote in a Facebook post.\nCopyright 2024 WHNS via Gray Media Group, Inc.
