  "text": "It looks like we’ll get to enjoy Kevin Conroy 's Batman and Mark Hamill 's Joker one final time together as they reunite for the final chapter of DC Animation’s animated film Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths . These two actors have worked a lot together over the years as Batman and Joker, but after Conroy passed away, this is the final project that they worked on together. It’s one of their last collaborations.\nThis news comes from IGN , and they also share the full voice cast for Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths – Part 3 . The movie will feature some new names joining the project. The list includes:\nKevin Conroy – Batman\nMark Hamill – Joker\nCorey Stoll – Lex Luthor\nBrian Bloom – Adam Strange & Sidewinter\nElysia Rotaru – Black Canary\nArmen Taylor – Jay Garrick\nCynthia Kaye McWilliams – Dr. Beth Chapel/Cheetah\nDean Winters – Captain Storm\nJason Spisak – Blue Lantern Razer, Hayseed\nBrett Halton – Batlash & Captain Atom\nAshly Burch – Nightshade, Queen Mera\nKatee Sackhoff – Poison Ivy\nWarner Bros. Discovery Home Entertainment recently announced the release dates for DC Animation’s Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths – Part Two .\nThe sequel will be available to rent or buy on digital platforms starting on April 23rd. On that same day, it will also be available to buy on 4K UHD in limited edition steelbook packaging and Blu-ray. The physical release of the film will also include bonus features such as interviews with the filmmakers on how they created a comprehensive universe across seven films.\nThe description for the film reads: “An endless army of SHADOW DEMONS bent on the destruction of all reality swarms over our world and all parallel Earths. The only thing opposing them is the mightiest team of metahumans ever assembled. But not even the combined power of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and all their fellow superheroes can slow down the onslaught of this invincible horde. What mysterious force is driving them? And how do the long-buried secrets of the Monitor and Supergirl threaten to crush our last defense?”\nBased on DC’s iconic comic book limited series by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez , Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths – Part Two is directed by Jeff Wamester from a script by Jim Krieg . Casting and voice direction is by Wes Gleason . It is produced by Jim Krieg and Kimberly S.
