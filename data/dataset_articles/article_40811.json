  "text": "[Salesforcecom](/user/salesforcecom)on Thu, 02/29/2024 - 14:39 Today, Salesforce announced 15 grantees of its Catalyst Fund , which provides unrestricted capital to smaller and younger nonprofits focused on increasing access to quality education and advancing climate justice. Today, Salesforce announced 15 grantees of its [Catalyst Fund](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/salesforce-catalyst-fund-announcement/?amp) , which provides unrestricted capital to smaller and younger nonprofits focused on increasing access to quality education and advancing climate justice. Why it matters: Disparities in education quality remain a [significant challenge](https://cepa.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/wp19-06-v082022.pdf) , limiting socioeconomic opportunities for many individuals. Climate change also impacts the [most vulnerable communities](https://www.un.org/ohrlls/news/frontline-climate-crisis-worlds-most-vulnerable-nations-suffer-disproportionately) . These grants are helping smaller, younger organizations grow their programs and reach new audiences, innovate for solutions and test big ideas, and secure additional funding. - [Rese](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/effective_change_requires_proximate_leaders) [arch](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/effective_change_requires_proximate_leaders)shows that organizations with leaders embedded in the communities they serve have the experience, relationships, data, and knowledge necessary to develop effective solutions. - Nonprofits with unrestricted funding also demonstrate [greater resilience and capacity](https://cep.org/the-impact-of-large-unrestricted-grants-on-nonprofits-a-five-year-view/). This flexibility allows them to create and scale solutions by allocating resources to operational costs, technology, and outreach efforts. Go deeper: Salesforce’s latest round of funding will allocate a total of $2 million to nonprofits to support 15 organizations across the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. - The fund has also extended its reach to include three organizations with a specific focus on climate justice to build the next generation of climate leaders and advance a just transition to a green economy. - With these latest contributions, the Catalyst Fund will have awarded a cumulative total of $6 million to 50 nonprofit partners since 2021. What they’re saying: - “We’re proud to support these exceptional organizations, recognizing that getting access to philanthropic capital is often harder for younger and smaller nonprofits. We’ve seen the transformative impact of our education Catalyst Fund partners and we’re thrilled to broaden our reach to support climate justice organizations.” – Becky Ferguson, SVP of Philanthropy at Salesforce & CEO of the Salesforce Foundation - “The transition to clean energy is inevitable, but creating an equitable distribution of benefits takes intention. With unrestricted funding, I have greater capacity to focus on the most impactful work with young clean energy leaders instead of worrying about how to cover the core operations that are always so difficult for nonprofits.” – Esther Morales, Catalyst Fund Grantee and Executive Director, CELI We’ve seen the transformative impact of our education Catalyst Fund partners and we’re thrilled to broaden our reach to support climate justice organizations.Becky Ferguson, SVP of Philanthropy at Salesforce & CEO of the Salesforce Foundation New Catalyst Fund grantees: These 15 grantees are committed to driving access to education and economic opportunity and advancing climate justice in the communities they serve: - [America On Tech](https://www.americaontech.org/): Grew its tech sector partnerships, resulting in over $1.5 million in internship wages for students in the 2022-2023 school year.
