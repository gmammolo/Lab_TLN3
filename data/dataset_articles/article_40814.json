  "text": "The City is evaluating community feedback on the draft concept plan for improvements to Highton's five hectare Morena Street Reserve. This hidden gem, running from Morena Street to Old Flour Mill Road, is a favourite among walkers, pet owners and families with its impressive views and limited road frontage. The steeply sloping site has a number of environmental, water management and accessibility factors to consider. The City's draft concept plan proposes keeping the existing wetlands and $2.2 million in works to this undeveloped open space over three years. This includes new pedestrian paths, a grass kickabout space, improved drainage, new trees and vegetation, and seating. Consultation last November and December saw 1,221 visitors visit our Have Your Say page, with nearly 95 per cent of contributors out of the 250 completed surveys and quick polls supporting the draft plan. Mayor Trent Sullivan Public feedback is a vital part of the City's planning for parks and recreation areas. We thank community members from Highton and beyond for sharing their ideas and letting the team know how the draft concept plan for Morena Street Reserve can improve. This data will inform our final concept plan, with the project to progress to detailed design this year. Councillor Ron Nelson The Morena Street Reserve is a complex site with the footprint of an existing trail and drainage basin in the northern area. This reserve is a bit of a hidden gem in Highton, with stunning views across the Barwon River, central Geelong and Corio Bay. There are a lot of factors to consider and I'm looking forward to the final concept plan and works maximising the potential of this special space.
