  "text": "B&M Boosts Local Gillingham Economy With Opening of Brand New Store 29 February 2024 The people of Gillingham were delighted on Friday the 29th of February with the grand opening of a new B&M discount store. The new B&M store created over 45 jobs in the local area and will allow the people of Gillingham to get big brands at better prices. After completing extensive internal and external renovation of a previous Wilko store, B&M have completely revitalised the premises. Now boasting over 11,000sqft of floor space customers will not be disappointed! Customers can expect to find a wide variety of branded groceries for the best possible price including a range of food, drink, and pet food. There will also be a fantastic selection of quality health and beauty products, homeware, electricals, DIY essentials, toys, games, gifts, and plenty more to explore. The colleagues were asked to nominate a local charity they think truly deserves some VIP treatment for the work they do for the local community. They chose the team from [My Shining Star](https://myshiningstar.co.uk/) to take centre stage and officially unveil the new B&M store. [My Shining Star](https://myshiningstar.co.uk/) are a children’s cancer charity that was born from a group of individuals who took part in a very large fundraising campaign for a local little girl named Ruby Laura. This campaign opened their eyes to the significant impact that cancer has not only on the child diagnosed, but on the whole family. This led to the charity being originally founded in 2016 and has helped well over 5,000 families in the UK. The three priorities that they focus on are: financial hardship, sibling support and bereaved families. This can include supporting with utilities, specialist beds, white goods, help towards food costs, hospital travel expenses and trauma therapy training. The store manager from B&M said: “We’re feeling extremely positive about the creation of more jobs for local people, and we hope customers are going to be delighted with their new store.” The store manager also commented: “My Shining Star really stood out for us, so we wanted to give them some VIP treatment as a thank you for all the hard work that they have done. We hope that our donation can help them to continue the great work they do.” For more information please visit our [Rainham](/stores/rainham-832) store.",
