Advertisement\n\"We reached out to Lilly's caretaker, who was so thrilled to hear that his closest companion was safe and sound,\" the post said. \"We learned from him that, despite her small size, Lilly had an adventurous spirit like no other.\"\nThe shelter offered to spay, vaccine and microchip Lilly for the man and they were reunited once her procedures were completed.\n\"When Lilly reunited with her dad, the relief and happiness was so clear on both of their faces. She melted into his arms as his eyes filled with tears of joy,\" the rescue said.\nRead More Live stream cameras set up to capture hatching of bald eagle eggs Birthday scratch-off earns Illinois woman $1 million Washington road sign hacked to warn of 'Angry Raccoons Ahead'",
