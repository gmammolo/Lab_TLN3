  "text": "In the warmer months, in a north Lawrence garden plot, a vibrant array of colors exists showcasing vegetables and plants of all kinds. Native flowers, herbs, peppers, potatoes, sweet potatoes and tomatoes are cultivated by the KU Community Garden.\nStudents and staff will gather to grow food for themselves and donate to\nJust Food Kansas, a local nonprofit that provides fresh produce to the Lawrence community. The 10,000-square-foot garden serves as both a source of fresh food and a hub for connection among the local community.\nKUCG hosted its open house on Saturday and invited the community to take part in its garden and begin planting season. Around 20 students gathered in the campus greenhouse near Monarch Watch to plant seeds into pots.\n“It’s a great way to see people come out and get together,” co-president Reb Bryant said. “Whether they are like a really committed gardener, or they want to get their hands dirty for one day. It’s nice to see all these people coming together and get really passionate about what they can do for their community.”\nThe garden has beds where soil is raised above ground and enclosed in wood. KUCG has several beds dedicated solely to donations, but students can also have an individual plot to plant their own garden. If students have an individual plot they are asked to commit to three service days on the donation bed. KUCG donates 500-800 pounds of produce to Just Food Kansas.\n“When you’re all out there sweating together, you’re connected,” Bryant said.\nKUCG will have\nvarious service events throughout the spring and the summer to get people involved in the garden. Some fraternities and sororities have also helped out. Shannon Criss, an architecture professor at the University of Kansas, has been the KUCG staff advisor for 10 years now.\nCriss went on a sabbatical in 2012 to study architecture and community gardens throughout the U.S. When she came back, the position opened up, and she decided to step in to become the advisor.\n“I decided that instead of a theoretical proposition, I had to get my hands dirty,” Criss said.\nCriss said that the garden has reduced her food budget by around 30-40%. She said she is also interested in planting more native plants to help butterflies and bees.\n“I really appreciate food more,” Criss said. “I’m less inclined to waste.”\nCriss and Bryant said they were always looking for new members to help grow and plant with KUCG.",
