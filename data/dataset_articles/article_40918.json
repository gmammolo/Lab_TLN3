  "text": "SMETHPORT — The administrator of in Smethport has something to say to the community: Thank you for the overwhelming support. On Thursday, Patricia Barber reached out to The Era with a message, in the aftermath of [a story earlier in the week about Lakeview's parent company Bonamour failing to pay the bills of the Smethport nursing home](https://www.bradfordera.com/news/smethport-unpaid-workers-lawsuits-trouble-lakeview-nursing-facility/article_95347b20-d5b6-11ee-985e-570645690eab.html) — including payroll and employee health insurance. \"I would like to thank every employee at Lakeview Healthcare and Rehabilitation for their dedication and commitment they have shown over the past few weeks,\" Barber said. \"Their relentless selflessness shined through as they stayed and took care of their residents. They are true and dedicated employees and heroes in my eyes.\" Employees were not paid last week, and it wasn't for the first time. An ongoing class action lawsuit in Allegheny County Court alleged Bonamour collected employee contributions for health insurance, but failed to turn them over to the insurance provider, UPMC Health Plan. Subsequently, all of the employees — including the ones at Lakeview — were unknowingly without health insurance coverage for at least April, May and June 2023. Medicare inspection reports revealed that Bonamour stopped paying bills within 12 days of purchasing Lakeview and five other homes. Unpaid utility bills resulted in at least one shut-off notice, which was paid before the utility was shut off. In Barber's statement, she expressed her appreciation to area nursing homes for reaching out to Lakeview. \"I would also like to thank the neighboring facilities — Sweden Valley Manor, Bradford Manor, Bradford Ecumenical and Sena Kean Manor — for supporting Lakeview Healthcare and Rehabilitation through phone calls, visits and a few wonderful lunch surprises. \"I would also like to thank Gerard Rettger and Nate Burgett with the McKean County Department of Emergency Services for stopping by to see if there was anything that we needed,\" Barber said. \"From the bottom of my heart, thank you all! It is nice to know that the community has such a wonderful and caring support system.\" She added, \"I am so proud to move forward with Team Lakeview.\"",
