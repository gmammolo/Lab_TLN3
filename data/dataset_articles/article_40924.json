Wall is up to three home runs this spring.\nDavid Fletcher stole home for the Braves and went 3-for-4 with a double, an RBI single and two runs. Marcell Ozuna added a solo shot and starter Dylan Dodd (1-0) tossed two spotless innings with two strikeouts.\nTampa Bay trailed 12-2 entering the bottom of the sixth but scored the final seven runs of the game before running out of time.

Atlanta held Minnesota to five hits while striking out 11 batters.\nKody Funderburk (0-1) gave up four runs (three earned) on four hits and a walk while striking out two over 1 2/3 innings in relief of starter Chris Paddack, who had two scoreless, hitless innings.\nOrioles 9, Pirates 8\nDaniel Johnson drove in Errol Robinson to complete a four-run comeback in the bottom of the ninth as host Baltimore edged Pittsburgh in Sarasota, Fla.\nWith one out, pinch hitter Silas Ardoin hit a two-run triple to begin the charge, and Robinson singled Ardoin home to tie the game before stealing second. Their heroics made a winner out of reliever Tucker Davidson (1-0), who struck out two while giving up a run on two hits over two innings.\nHenry Davis, the No. 1 overall draft pick by the Pirates in 2021, hit a three-run homer off Orioles starter Corbin Burnes in the top of the first. Connor Sadzeck (0-1) blew the save.\nRed Sox 5, Tigers 2\nRafael Devers hit a solo home run and finished 2-for-3 with two runs as Boston defeated visiting Detroit in Fort Myers, Fla.\nTrevor Story added RBIs on a double and a bases-loaded walk, while starter Garrett Whitlock (1-0) fanned six batters over three innings, yielding a run on three hits.\nRyan Kreidler and Trei Cruz drove in the Tigers’ runs.

Nationals starter Patrick Corbin (1-1) struck out four and allowed three hits in three scoreless frames.\nCesar Prieto drove in the Cardinals’ only run of the game on a single in the bottom of the ninth. Both teams managed just five hits.\nPhillies 5, Blue Jays 0\nTrea Turner went 2-for-3 with an RBI and seven Philadelphia pitchers combined to allow just four hits in a shutout of host Toronto in Dunedin, Fla.\nMax Castillo and Kolby Allard (1-0) set the tone by each pitching two innings with one hit, one walk and one strikeout. The final five relievers combined to yield just two hits while accounting for five of the Jays batters’ seven strikeouts. Colin Pache added a solo homer for the Phillies.\nJose Berrios started for the Blue Jays and gave up two hits in two scoreless innings. Connor Cooke (0-1) allowed Turner’s go-ahead hit.\n–Field Level Media",
