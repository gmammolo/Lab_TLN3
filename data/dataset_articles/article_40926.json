  "text": "By This article was brought to you by Lake Grove Dental, Lake Oswego Review Expert. Sponsored Content ,\n1 hour ago\nBeing voted the best dentist in town is an esteemed recognition accompanied by significant responsibilities. It symbolizes not only professional competence but also a commitment to exemplary patient care and satisfaction. This accolade carries more weight than mere acknowledgment; it signifies a mandate to maintain the highest standards of dentistry and ethical conduct.First and foremost, being bestowed with the title dentist means we assume the responsibility for the oral health of our community. Patients entrust their well-being to us, expecting expert guidance, compassionate care, and effective treatments; all in an office using the most contemporary equipment and materials. We must continually enhance expertise through ongoing education, staying abreast of the latest advancements in dentistry.We began as a small three operatory office in the First Addition; fostering trust and cultivating strong patient relationships has been the backbone of Lake Grove Dental since 1960. Attentive listening, clear communication of procedures, and involving patients in treatment decisions are paramount to establishing a supportive and comfortable environment.Using a conservative approach to restorative care and doing biomimetic dentistry (replicating the strength, function, and esthetics of natural teeth by replacing only damaged, decayed, and broken tooth structure whenever possible) is Dr. Branen’s mantra. Understanding the connection of oral health to total health, and helping our patients understand that too, is also an important part of what we do.We thank all who voted for us and will strive to always hit the high bar for our community.",
