  "text": "By Isabella Warren ,\n3 hours ago BEND, Ore. (KTVZ)-- It's a very special birthday Thursday for one Bend woman. Annie Barlow just turned 84, but this is only her 21st birthday celebration. That's because she was born on a leap day, Feb. 29, 1940.\nAnnie says growing up, her birthdays were just like everyone else's, however the day was always different.\n\"Whenever there was a free evening, they'd sit down. They'd say, 'Okay, this is when we're going to celebrate your birthday.' So, you know, it was -- I really didn't feel any different.\" Barlow said.\nShe did have some advice for fellow \"21-year-olds\" this year: \"Don't stub your toe along the way, because you don't realize at that age what something on your record might hold you back when you get older.\"\nShe also says to stay positive.\nUsually, every four years, an extra day is added to the calendar, due to the Earth's orbit not syncing with the number of days in the year. It actually takes longer than 365 days to complete an orbit around the sun.\nAnnie says she's happy to celebrate another year -- and says next year, she'll celebrate on whatever day she wants.\nWe'll have Isabella Warren's story on Annie's special birthday on NewsChannel 21 at Five.\nThe post 84-year-old Bend woman celebrates her ’21st birthday’ this leap day appeared first on KTVZ .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
