  "text": "By Nick Beres ,\n1 hour ago Twenty-five years ago, I was there with a little boy named Kyle who wanted some new ears.\nHe got them, and now all this time later Kyle is an adult. He showed me how it changed his life.\nKyle was born with cup ears, and later he faced plenty of painful questions from his fellow 6-year-olds.\n\"They started calling him names like big ears and stuff,\" Kyle said to me back in 1999.\nInsurance would not cover surgery for new ears, but Operation Smile did, and Kyle's mother was grateful.\n\"It means everything to him. At a very young age, he was different, and he wanted ears like ours,\" said Lora Adams at the time.\nI was there with Kyle in the OR all those years ago with his surgeon Jack Fisher for a special report. And we recently came across the story in our archive and found Kyle still living in Middle Tennessee\nWe thought it would be neat to sit down with Kyle, now 31, and talk to him.\n\"I do remember the reveal and wondering what it looked like. I wanted to see for myself,\" Kyle said.\n\"Here, you hold the mirror. What do you think buddy? Good.\"\n\"I had been waiting for that moment for a long time to look at it like that.\"\nKyle says he doesn't think about his ears much anymore.\nBut, he's so thankful for the change that happened all those years ago.\n\"I'm blessed. I'm very blessed.\"\nKyle hopes his story gives hope to other children facing the same thing he did, and to see how things can change from then to now.\nCarrie recommends: Arizona journalist explains voucher outcomes before Tennessee considers the same I have two boys in elementary school, so as the school voucher debate takes center stage again – I wanted to really understand this issue. Arizona started its school voucher program 13 years ago and is the first state in the nation to offer universal school vouchers. That's what Governor Lee is proposing in two years. I leaned on the expertise of an investigative reporter in Arizona - and she came through with facts, figures and plenty of insight. This reporting gave me a lot to think about as a mom and a taxpayer. I think it will for you too.\n-Carrie Sharp\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
