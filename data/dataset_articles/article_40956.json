  "text": "Atlanta Braves ace Spencer Strider is already one of the best pitchers in MLB.\nHe didn’t have the lowest ERA in 2023, at 3.86, but no one misses bats quite like him among starters.\nHe punched out 281 hitters last year, in 186.2 innings.\nThe ace throws a fastball which is his bread and butter, and his slider is his best secondary offering.\nHe also throws a changeup, but only about seven percent of the time.\nBetween his sometimes spotty command and the fact he throws mainly two pitches, he can be prone to home runs, or at least was in 2023.\nHe has seemingly been working hard to add a fourth offering to keep hitters honest: a curveball.\nIt’s looking good.\n“Nice looking new curveball from Spencer Strider, looks like he can command it well too. 3-2 count,” writer and researcher Eno Sarris tweeted.\nNice looking new curveball from Spencer Strider, looks like he can command it well too. 3-2 count.\n[pic.twitter.com/AjJOOFgCKp]\n— Eno Sarris (@enosarris)\n[February 29, 2024]\nIt’s not your average 12-6 curveball, though: it also has significant glove-side break.\nIt looked like a fastball outside but its two-plane break brought it back to the zone, which earned him a strikeout looking.\nThis could definitely become another part of his regular arsenal as long as he has confidence in the pitch.\nHe had it on Thursday, in a spring training game.\nHowever, it remains to be seen if he will be willing to use it in any count and in any situation when the games that count start.\nIn any case, it’s always nice to see an elite performer work even harder on his craft, which is what happened here.\nStrider, if healthy, could be primed for a career year in 2024.\nNEXT: Video Shows A Positive Sign From Chris Sale",
