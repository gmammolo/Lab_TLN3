  "text": "Survivors and Supporters Around the World Take Part in NO MORE Week 5K to Increase Awareness and Action\nEINPresswire.com/ -- This weekend, The NO MORE Foundation is launching NO MORE Week 2024, a global event to shine an even brighter spotlight on the critical issues of domestic and sexual violence. From March 3rd through March 9th, NO MORE, its chapters and thousands of its allies, partners and supporters around the world will be taking part in activities and initiatives aimed at increasing awareness and action to stop and prevent all forms of abuse and assault that 1 in 3 women and 1 in 6 men experience.\nHighlights of the NO MORE Week 2024 include:\n●\nNO MORE Week Virtual 5K- Supported by the NFL, participants can complete the 5K any way they want at any time during March 3rd through 9th.

Do it alone or get a team of friends or colleagues to do it together.\n●\nNO MORE Tech. Conference- On March 5th, NO MORE is hosting the free, online conference, “Silicon Saviors or Digital Threats? Exploring Tech's Impact on Domestic and Sexual Violence.” Spanning five continents, with 13 sessions, and more than 40 expert speakers, the conference will focus on how tech. is being used to stalk, harass, and harm survivors, but also how it’s being used to enhance safety and connectivity. Attendees can attend one or more sessions live and have access to all for two weeks.\n“On average, nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States and an American is sexually assaulted every 68 seconds. It’s so commonplace but still so often overlooked. NO MORE Week is about coming together and saying that we can no longer look away,” said NO MORE CEO Pamela Zaballa. “There’s no simple solution but every single person can make a difference by speaking out and taking small but meaningful actions in their homes, workplaces and communities.”\nMore information and registration for the 5K and tech. conference are\navailable here.\nAbout NO MORE: The NO MORE Foundation is dedicated to ending domestic violence and sexual assault by increasing awareness, inspiring action, and fueling culture change.
