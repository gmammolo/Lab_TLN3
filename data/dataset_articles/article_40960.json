  "text": "EINPresswire.com/ -- The Los Angeles Trial Lawyers' Charities (LATLC) hosted a high-action 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament on Sunday, February 25, 2024, at The Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks. This event has become an annual favorite, showcasing LATLC's dedication to bringing people together through sports.\nFollowing intense competition, the First Place Winners were DeWitt M. Lacy (Burris, Nisenbaum, Curry, & Lacy) and the HollyWitt LitiGators, clinching the championship trophy after a hard-fought battle! In Second Place, the Title Sponsor of the tournament was ChartSquad. Third Place went to The Tissot Titans, which were last year’s winner. The Half-Court Contest Winner went to Johnny Rundell of Hershey Law. Last but not least, the MVP went to Shawn Zaman of Zaman Trial Lawyers PC who played victoriously on DeWitt M. Lacy’s team. The tournament's impact extended far beyond the court. Through the collective efforts of participants, sponsors, and organizers, LATLC raised over $87,000, making the grand total for basketball tournaments $300,000 since 2021. These funds will directly support the next Great Tryke Giveaway scheduled for July 27, 2024, an initiative to provide adaptive tricycles to children with special needs, enhancing their mobility and independence.\nReflecting on the event's success, 2024 LATLC President Bradley Wallace expressed gratitude, stating, \"The LATLC 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament has become an amazing and family-friendly annual event that enables our organization to raise significant funds to support So. Cal. Trykers & their annual Great Tryke Giveaway event. LATLC is thankful for everyone's support, as these funds will truly make a difference in the lives of so many extraordinary children in our community.\"\nWith the resounding success of this year's tournament, LATLC is excited to continue its tradition of combining sportsmanship with philanthropy, bringing people together while supporting important causes in the Los Angeles area.\nAbout Los Angeles Trial Lawyers' Charities (LATLC):\nLATLC, established in 2006 by seven plaintiff personal injury attorneys in the greater Los Angeles Area, has expanded into a thriving organization with over 3,000 supporters.
