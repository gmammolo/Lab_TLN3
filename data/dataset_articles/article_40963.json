  "text": "When it comes to love, many wish for a happy relationship. A partner of full respect, understanding and harmony. But a loving relationship is a two-way street, which means that both parties need to work hard. Countless things have been written about how to recognize a bad relationship... you need to get away from manipulative behavior, a partner who controls you too much, belittles you and doesn't respect your boundaries. One should get away from the one who does not encourage your ancestor and who does not support you. Of course, you are also expected not to have such problematic behaviors. It's not enough to just 'find' each other, you have to make an effort, and every happy couple has gone through some storms. Maybe it wasn't always a fairy tale, but just such situations made them stronger. The concept of a healthy relationship is quite broad because people have different expectations. Over the years, priorities may change. However, there are several clear indicators that a relationship is healthy. Honest communication Couples in happy relationships are willing to talk about a variety of topics. They like to share what happens to them - even if it's bad. They do not know taboos, they are casual and open. It's hard for them to imagine a day when they don't talk about small things from work, plans, stress or interesting anecdotes. In short: they share the little things of life and know that their partner will not judge them even if they have opposite opinions. It is desirable to talk with your partner about (almost) everything and strive to be friends first and foremost. When a problem arises, it should be communicated without drama. On the other hand, it is desirable to get to know each other again and again and plan together. Confidence What is a relationship without trust? And without openness and honesty, there is no trust. Trust is built over time and through words and actions. Happy couples have no secrets, trust each other at their word and are not jealous or suspicious. They feel comfortable and safe and know that their partner will not hurt them. They are very supportive of each other and always respect each other's wishes. Autonomy Both parties have the right to make decisions and feel equal. No belittling or imposing. Couples in happy relationships appreciate quality time spent and bonding moments, but they are aware that they both need to have some time for themselves. The relationship does not suffocate them but fills them up. They cherish social lives and know how to judge when it's time to separate for a while. They have their own society and hobbies. Although they are together, they are still individuals who respect the space of freedom and boundaries. Playfulness Regardless of life's troubles, it's great when your partner is the one you laugh with. Time together could relax you and remind you that life is beautiful. So don't forget about yourself and try to get out of the routine at least for a while. For example, try a joint sports activity or go on a trip. Laugh and try to get closer. Teamwork Happy couples function like a team. They respect each other and strive to progress together. In short, they have each other's backs. They know that their partner is there for them, but that they both need to contribute. A healthy sex life Of course, sex is also an integral part of a healthy relationship. It is not good when the relationship is reduced to sex, but it is also not good when there is no sex, because it often leads to frustrations. Happy couples try to talk about everything, including intimacy. They freely discuss their wishes and mutual satisfaction is important to them. They respect the moments when one party is not interested in sex and try to keep the passion alive. With them, there is no pressure that intercourse has to happen. Boundaries are respected. They don't forget about gentle touches, kisses or joint activities that remind them that they care. Conflict resolution Not everything is always perfect, so the couple must know how to solve the problem. Although they don't always agree, they don't turn their heads away from the problem. They try to settle the dispute peacefully. Partners who resolve conflict without judgment or contempt can often find a compromise or solution. And that is the most important thing. And - are you in a happy relationship? If you find yourself in this, you're on the right track. Bonus video:",
