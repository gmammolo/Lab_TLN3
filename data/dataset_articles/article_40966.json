  "text": "The Japanese autonomous is pursuing the tech in Japan to support the aging population, but without putting them at risk. Nissan has announced that it will roll out commercialized autonomous driving technology in Japan by 2027, disclosing a roadmap for this timeline. The self-driving tech Nissan will introduce is SAE Level 4, similar to the [controversial Cruise robotaxi](https://carbuzz.com/news/gm-backed-cruise-scales-back-to-one-city-delays-cruise-origin-launch) and higher than what Mercedes-Benz has been [testing on US roads since last year](https://carbuzz.com/news/mercedes-benz-becomes-first-automaker-to-launch-level-3-autonomous-driving-in-usa). According to the automaker, self-driving cars will solve transportation service issues faced by local communities in Japan, including driver shortages due to an aging population. More than one out of 10 people in Japan are now aged 80 or older, according to the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/09/elderly-oldest-population-world-japan). Nissan has been testing business models for its mobility service since 2017, including a manned version called Namie Smart Mobility operating since 2021. The company has also been testing self-driving cars in London and other areas with the support of the UK government. Despite the images here showing a [Nissan Leaf](https://carbuzz.com/cars/nissan/leaf), road tests will be conducted in the Minato Mirai area of Yokohama using an autonomous driving vehicle based on the Serena minivan starting in 2024. This will proceed to service demonstration tests from 2025 to 2026, with 20 vehicles (with drivers on board). A full rollout of the mobility service using self-driving cars will happen in 2027, and given that there will be human backups, we struggle to see any drawbacks. Nissan isn't the only automaker aiming to offer driverless taxis in Japan. GM's Cruise Origin is set to be [offered in Tokyo by 2026](https://carbuzz.com/news/cruise-self-driving-robotaxi-going-global-amid-us-backlash) through the American company's partnership with Honda. However, it will be at a much larger scale and on an earlier schedule, with a target of introducing a fleet of 500 robotaxis beyond 2026. Just like Nissan, Honda's push to offer autonomous technology in Japan is connected to the increasing shortage of drivers due to an aging population. By using the technology in daily real-world conditions with human redundancies to keep everyone safe, this initiative has the potential to rapidly advance the progress of AI-driven cars.",
