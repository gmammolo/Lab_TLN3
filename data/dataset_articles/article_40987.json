It'll say minus means add more treats. Once they hit the right amount it's a smiley face,,\" University of Delaware student Logan Feiler said.\nFor more information and if you would like to order treats for your furry friend, visit\nwaggies.org.\nSign up for our\n[Breaking] [newsletter]to get the most urgent news stories in your inbox.",
