  "text": "UNION CENTER, S.D.- Missy Urbaniak teaches kindergarten through eight grade at Atall School in rural Meade County. She was nominated to receive the 1+1 award from NewsCenter1 and First Interstate Bank, which gifts her with $500 to use for her classroom.\nInspired to Teach\n\"I had grandparents, great grandparents, who were teachers, and some of them even taught in country schools out here in Meade County. So even though I didn't grow up out here and I didn't attend a country school, it was part of my growing up,\" Urbaniak adds.\nAfter marrying a local rancher, she returned to rural Meade County and had the opportunity follow her own elementary school dream. \"It just was a given that this was where I was meant to be. It's what I've wanted to do since I was a fourth grader, was to teach. So it just fits,\" she says.\nSmall school benefits\nUrbaniak adds that small schools provide a variety of benefits, from individualized lesson plans to friendships that transcend grade levels. \"To see that growth and have that kind of experience with them is really unique. But also really rewarding because you see exactly how much progress they make year to year, and then you can build on it so much easier. So that's a really a good benefit,\" she explains. \"It's great that the older kids are here for the younger kids to watch. They learn so much just from watching each other.\"\nMoney for books\nUrbaniak hopes to buy binoculars for her students so that they can more closely observe wildlife from the classroom and expand her book collection. \"With teaching a span of nine levels, I need all kinds of books, and so that'll be my first, my first purchase probably.\"\nTo nominate your favorite teacher for the 1+1 Giveaway, click\nhere.",
