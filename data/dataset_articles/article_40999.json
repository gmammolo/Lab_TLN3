  "text": "Commonwealth Games bronze medallists Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand cruised into the quarter-finals of the German Open 2024 badminton women’s doubles event in Mulheim on Thursday. The Indian duo, 23rd in the badminton rankings , took 28 minutes to defeat their world No. 141 opponents Sona Horinkova and Katerina Zuzakova of Czechia 21-10, 21-11 in the round of 16. Treesa and Gayatri faced a tough challenge before the mid-game intervals in both games. However, a strong performance by the Indian pair after the breaks eventually made it a lop-sided affair. The Indian badminton players , who played an integral part in the Indian women’s team’s historic gold medal win at the 2024 Badminton Asia Team Championships in Busan, will take on the winner of the match between USA’s Francesca Corbett-Allison Lee and the People’s Republic of China’s Li Yi Jing-Luo Xu Min. The pair of Treesa and Gayatri is the only Indian challenge alive at the German Open, a BWF Super 300 event. Earlier in the day, Aakarshi Kashyap and Sathish Kumar Karunakaran lost the women’s and men’s singles second-round matches, respectively. Kashyap, world No. 43, lost 21-13, 21-14 to 22nd-ranked Mia Blichfeldt of Denmark in the round of 16. In the men’s singles, Karunakaran, 50th in the rankings, suffered a 21-18, 24-22 loss against world No. 42 Nhat Nguyen of Ireland. The German Open 2024 is the sixth tournament on the 2024 badminton calendar and offers qualifying ranking points to shuttlers for the Paris 2024 Olympics. The qualification window for badminton started on May 1 last year and will end in April.",
