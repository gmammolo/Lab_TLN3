It is necessary to focus on solving social problems, said Muhammad Yunus, Nobel Peace Prize laureate (2006), at a panel session at the XI Global Baku Forum, Trend reports. \"Addressing social issues should be our primary focus, as it stands among our main challenges. Rather than rebuilding, our aim should be to innovate and create anew,\" the Nobel laureate said.
