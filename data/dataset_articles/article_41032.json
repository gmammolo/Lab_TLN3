  "text": "By The Blade ,\n3 hours ago\nUFC legend and Fremont native Mark Coleman was awake and responsive Thursday after he was hospitalized from smoke inhalation from saving his parents in a house fire earlier in the week.\nColeman, 59, is shown in a video posted to Instagram declaring himself, “the happiest man in the world.”\n\"I swear to God, I'm so lucky,\" Coleman said in the video. \"I can't believe my parents are alive. I had to make a decision. I got out of my room and went to the door and it was already horrible, I couldn't breathe. I almost had to go outside, but I went back and got them. I can't believe it.\"\nColeman reportedly pulled his mother Connie Foos Coleman and father Dan Coleman out of their South River Road home Tuesday morning, but suffered smoke inhalation after returning to attempt to save his dog. Hammer, and had to be airlifted from the scene.\nA GoFundMe was set up for Coleman's as his daughters, Morgan and Kenzie, will take time off work to help him recover. As of Thursday, more than $71,000 had been raised.\n“He managed to carry both of his parents out of the house, but despite his best efforts was not able to save Hammer,” Morgon wrote on Instagram Tuesday. “He was life-flighted to the hospital where he is currently battling for his life after this heroic act. Our father has always been our hero and means the world to us. He is and always will be a fighter. The strongest and bravest man I know.”\nColeman was a two-time state wrestling champion for Fremont St. Joseph (1981, 1983) and won an NCAA championship for Ohio State in 1988.\nIn 1997, he became the UFC's first heavyweight champion and he was later inducted in the UFC Hall of Fame in 2008.",
