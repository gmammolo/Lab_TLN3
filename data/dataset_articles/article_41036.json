  "text": "After not taking the field for the last two days of the 2024 Ranji Trophy final due to reported back pain, the star Indian batter joined his teammates to celebrate Mumbai&apos;s 42nd title victory on Thursday (March 14) with a wild dance at the Wankhede Stadium after the Ajinkya Rahane-led side&apos;s victory over Vidarbha in the summit clash. In a video that has gone viral on social media, Shreyas was spotted leading Mumbai's celebration as they ended an eight-year drought without the prestigious title. The clip showed Shreyas shaking a leg passionately with Dhol playing in the background at the iconic stadium.\nWatch here\nI recorded Shreyas iyer dancing after winning Ranji Trophy final! Wo 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️ pic.twitter.com/dyyclpveng\n— Cricket With Laresh (@Lareshhere) March 14, 2024 \\n\\n\nShreyas was absent from the field for Vidarbha's second inning, and reports have emerged since that the star Indian batter's back issues have flared up again. It has been suggested that the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) skipper is now doubtful for the first few games of the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL) season.\nShreyas has faced a troubled period in his career in recent times following a back injury suffered during the 2023 Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT), which kept him out of action for almost six months and forced him to undergo surgery.\nThe 29-year-old recovered in time for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 after missing the 2023 IPL and World Test Championship (WTC) final and suffering a setback in the Asia Cup. In the mega event, Shreyas was key to India's dream run to the final, which saw him make 526 runs in 10 innings, including a century in the semi-final vs. New Zealand.\nShreyas played an important role in Mumbai's victory in the Ranji final with a quick-fire knock of 95 in 111 balls in the second innings.\nRecently, Shreyas found himself in the middle of the storm after being dropped from the Indian test team and missing Mumbai's final two league stage Ranji Games and the quarter-final of the Ranji Trophy. In an unprecedented move, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) did not name him on the list of contracted players for the 2023-24 season.",
