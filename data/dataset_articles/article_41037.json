  "text": "WALLER – Thirty-year-old Jeremy the tortoise is well-known online.\nHis viral antics include frequent escape attempts from Blue Heron Farm in Waller. His owners adopted him last year to grace their petting zoo and beer garden, but Jeremy proved to be more itinerant than they’d bargained for.\nRecommended Videos\nThe 90-pound African spurred tortoise went missing so frequently that his owners were forced to put an Apple Air Tag on him to track his movements.\nBut around 5 p.m. on Wednesday, Jeremy’s owners posted that the tortoise was once again lost, and they were not getting ANY hits on his Air Tag.\npic.twitter.com/a8bXQGjBwP\n— Blue Heron Farm (@BlueHeronFarmTX) March 13, 2024 “We’ve put him in lost mode,” the post said.\nWhile Jeremy is known for sneaking off the farm, his owners were worried that Jeremy may have been taken.\nIt turned out to be a little bit of both.\nJeremy did indeed wander off the Waller farm -- and was picked up by a concerned citizen who took him to his OWN tortoise farm a mile away. Jeremy’s owners were able to track down his location Thursday using social media, but by the time they arrived, Jeremy had become romantically entangled with a female tortoise.\nWhen a user asked if Jeremy was perhaps roaming in search of a mate, his owners replied, “Was not out looking for a girlfriend, he just got lucky and found one where they took him.”\nWhat is love if not a game of luck?\nHis owners say they’ll be picking him up and bringing him home once his romantic rendezvous is over. It also turns out their location is too rural for the Air Tag to be of any use.\n“We’re just going to put a dog tag with our phone number on his shell next,” they posted.\nSEE ALSO: Drones for dogs?
