  "text": "KUTV — During pregnancy, there's a prevailing misconception that expectant mothers should not do very much from physical activity, fearing it could harm their unborn child. However, emerging research and expert opinions paint a different picture—one that highlights the importance of staying active throughout pregnancy for both maternal and fetal health. Candice (a certified personal trainer and pre and postnatal trainer) spoke to Elora about: Community support and accessible resources through the CBFIT App can help pregnant women navigate their fitness journeys with confidence and positivity. As we continue to redefine the narrative surrounding pregnancy and exercise, it's clear that staying active during this transformative time is not only beneficial but also empowering. By prioritizing maternal health and well-being, we set the stage for healthier pregnancies, smoother deliveries, and brighter futures for both mothers and babies alike. Join the CBFIT app at cbfitapp.com for more prenatal and postnatal workouts such as strength training and deep core and pelvic floor exercises.
