  "text": "The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Anambra State has commended the Nigerian Army for its sustained support and collaboration in strengthening security and public safety across the state.\nThe State Commandant of the NSCDC, Mr Maku Olatunde, gave the commendation while receiving the Commander of the 302 Artillery Regiment (General Support), Onitsha Cantonment, Colonel Butrus Yakubu, who led a delegation on a courtesy visit to the NSCDC State Command Headquarters in Awka.\nAccording to the NSCDC Head, Media and Tactical Operations Anambra State Command, SC Okadigbo, the visit was aimed at familiarisation and at reinforcing cooperation between both security agencies, particularly in intelligence and information sharing, operational access, and joint responses to security challenges.\nColonel Yakubu emphasised that effective security management depends largely on synergy among security institutions, noting that collaboration enhances intelligence gathering, coordination, and rapid response to emerging threats.\nHe reaffirmed the Nigerian Army‚Äôs commitment to supporting the NSCDC whenever the need arises.\nThe Army commander also praised the NSCDC for its contributions to security in Anambra State, especially through its Forward Operating Bases, which he said have played a significant role in maintaining law and order.\nIn his remarks, Commandant Olatunde highlighted the importance of inter-agency cooperation in promoting peace, stability, and operational efficiency.\nHe noted that the NSCDC and the Nigerian Army have a long-standing history of collaboration, including joint training programmes and coordinated operations against the vandalism of critical national, state, and local government infrastructure, and efforts to combat illegal oil bunkering and related crimes.\nHe stressed that no single security agency can effectively tackle crime in isolation, underscoring the need for sustained partnership and shared responsibility among security stakeholders.\nThe NSCDC State Commandant assured the Army leadership of his commitment to sustaining and further strengthening the existing collaboration between both agencies in the interest of public safety and security in Anambra State.\nLateefah Ibrahim",
