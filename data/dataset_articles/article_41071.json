  "text": "KENORA – The Ontario government is providing nearly $950,000 through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation for development at the Mount Evergreen Ski Club and McLeod Park.\nThe $496,500 going to the not-for-profit ski club will be used “for a multitude of projects,” club treasurer Thomas Nabb said Thursday.\n×\nAlready a Subscriber?

Evergreen Rd., a roughly 10-minute drive from downtown Kenora.\nThe City of Kenora is getting $450,000 to complete the second phase of a rehabilitation project at McLeod Park along the harbourfront, which includes restoring the James McMillan tugboat and building an accessible wooden ramp.\nKenora is grateful to the provincial government “for support that will allow the municipality to deliver additional improvements at McLeod Park,” said Mayor Andrew Poirier.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Greg Rickford, MPP for Kenora-Rainy River and Minister of Northern Development, said in a news release that the province \"is improving quality of life for those who live, work and play in the North by providing support for local tourism partners like the Mount Evergreen Ski Club and the City of Kenora.”",
