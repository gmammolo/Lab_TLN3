  "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — It was announced Thursday that Sen. Steve Daines, Sen. Jon Tester, Rep. Ryan Zinke, and Rep. Matt Rosendale organized and led a letter Thursday to Senate and House leadership in support of Daines’ legislation that would rename the VA Outpatient Clinic in Butte in honor of Charlie Dowd, Montana’s last Pearl Harbor survivor. Dowd, who died March 17, 2023, at the age of 99, fought at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, and would later earn seven Bronze Stars while serving in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. An excerpt from the letter, addressed to Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Minority Leader Mitchell, stated that “while we can never fully repay Charlie’s service to our state and this country, renaming this VA facility in Butte in his honor would be a step in the right direction.” People are also reading… This past November, Sen. Daines introduced the bill to rename the clinic after Dowd, and last month, Rep. Zinke introduced the companion bill in the House of Representatives.",
