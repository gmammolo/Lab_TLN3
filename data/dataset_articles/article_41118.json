  "text": "On Air Now [ The Smooth Late Show with Martin Collins ](/radio/shows-presenters/late-show/) 10pm - 1am 14 March 2024, 19:25 | Updated: 14 March 2024, 23:39 Prince William has spoken of how he continues to be guided by Princess Diana's legacy following a week under pressure over Kate's altered Mother's Day photo. The Prince of Wales was speaking at the Diana Award Legacy Award event at the Science Museum in London, which celebrates the achievements of young people from around the world. Talking about the impact his mother has had, Prince William said: \"I know that she would have been honoured to see a charity in her name doing such inspirational work to uplift young people from all corners of the globe.\" Speaking more personally, he added: \"She taught me that everyone has the potential to give something back; that everyone in need deserves a supporting hand in life. \"That legacy is something that both Catherine and I have sought to focus on through our work, as have the 50,000 young people who have received a Diana Award over the past 25 years.\" Prince Harry was also expected to speak to the winners via videolink from America. Both of the brothers, despite their differences, are still involved in the award, and every year have contributed to the ceremony in some way. This year's Legacy Award marks the start of The Diana Award's 25th anniversary year, the only charity to specifically set up in her name and recognising her belief that young people have the power to change the world. It comes after William paid tribute to his wife's creativity during a visit to a youth group in London earlier on Thursday.

The WEST centre, which stands for Where Everyone Sticks Together, was named by the youngsters who use the £12m facility, which officially opens in April. The future king also played pool and basketball with the children and teenagers before joining a group working on a mental health project.
