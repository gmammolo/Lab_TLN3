  "text": "A Co Down man has opened up on how an alcohol and drug addiction impacted his life.\nBarry Bannon from Newry had developed addictions in his teenage years and this continued until recent years when he realised the impact it was having on his family.\nThanks to his wife, Barry discovered Davina&apos;s Ark, a Newry-based addiction service which provides counselling and support to those battling addiction and their families.\nRead more: Belfast boxing coach helping others following mental health breakdown\nRead more: Belfast influencer&apos;s TikTok video banned after she downs four cocktails in 90 seconds\nSpeaking to Belfast Live, Barry said that Davina&apos;s Ark have been invaluable in keeping his family together.\n\"Davina&apos;s Ark helped me by getting me back into exercise, focusing on nutrition and developing a daily routine to make sure that my day was filled with meaningful things,\" he said.\n\"Another aspect of it was being truthful. Being open and honest is probably one of the main things instead of bottling things up and they helped me with one-to-one counselling and group sessions which my wife was also able to avail of along with family intervention services because not only was I going into recovery, she also had her own journey to recover from.\n\"In my mid-teens, I wouldn&apos;t have been as open and honest as I should have been and probably would have been ashamed to talk about my mental health. I struggled with mental health issues which escalated into me numbing things and feelings with drugs and alcohol.\n\"It wasn&apos;t until I was in my 20s that I managed to overcome my drug addiction but the alcohol addiction was festering in the background until it escalated.\"\nBarry said that he got to a \"breaking point\" where he knew that he needed help.\n\"I had had suicidal thoughts and not only was I at breaking point, my family were struggling. I knew then that something drastic had to be done for us to get through it and for me to get my life and family back.\n\"My wife found Davina&apos;s Ark and at that stage, I had been going to AA meetings and working with the community addictions team. I knew that I had to take every bit of help that I possibly could in order to fix it.\n\"Davina&apos;s Ark are a lifelong service and even though I am two and a half years sober now, I still go to my meetings every Friday because it keeps me right and I know that if I am ever struggling, I can avail of their counselling services again.\"\nBarry and his wife Rachael are raising money and awareness for Davina&apos;s Ark (Image: Submitted) Barry described his journey with addiction as \"an absolute rollercoaster\" and said that it has been the toughest thing he has had to face in his life.\n\"The mental aspect means that I am fighting it every day but being productive has helped me and I am now two and a half years in.\n\"I am actively out exercising, I am eating properly and I am sleeping properly. I also have a lot more confidence in myself and I am not afraid to say how I feel.\n\"I have a voice now and I want to be heard instead of hiding away.\"\nJoin our Belfast Live breaking news service on WhatsApp Click this link or scan the QR code to receive breaking news and top stories from Belfast Live.
