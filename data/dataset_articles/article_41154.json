  "text": "Marathon Oil (NYSE:\nMRO) +1.3% in Thursday's trading as Argus upgrades the stock to Buy from Hold with a $31 price target, pointing to the company's strong financial foundation, underscored by low debt levels and robust free cash flow yields.\nMarathon's (\nMRO) shareholder-oriented strategies, including consistent dividend increases and share repurchase programs, are supported by a three-year history of strong operational performance and growth in shareholder value, Argus analyst Bill Selesky says. Last month, Marathon ( MRO) reported Q4 adjusted earnings of $406M, or $0.69/share, down from $563M, or $0.88/share, in the year-earlier quarter, reflecting lower realized commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.\nFor FY 2024, the company expects total production of 380K-400K net boe/day, down from 405K net boe/day in 2023, with capital spending of $1.9B-$2.1B, compared to $2.03B in 2023.\nArgus lowers its 2024 EPS estimate to $2.58 from $3.51 previously to reflect weak Q4 results and its 2024 WTI crude oil price forecast of $80/bbl.",
