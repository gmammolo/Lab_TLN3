  "text": "OneLegacy Inspires Hollywood partnered with Danny Trejo and Trejo Music to present SOULDIEZ, a music concert that took place at the OneLegacy’s Headquarters in Azusa with the goal of sharing the power of music with the critical message of organ donation and transplantation. Hundreds of concert goers visited the local organ procurement organization last Saturday, and enjoyed the show hosted by legendary actor and musician, Danny Trejo, co-hosted by Becky Lu, and including the performances of Baby Bash, Cota the Barber, Pepe Marquez, Amoraa, Tarah New, and Raquel. The event also included testimonials from donor families, transplant recipients and living donors. A portion of the funds raised by this concert will be donated to the OneLegacy Foundation to help promote public education efforts to inspire local communities to Donate Life. With over 100,000 men, women, and children currently waiting for a lifesaving organ transplant in the U.S., OneLegacy continuously connects with local communities to inspire them to say “YES” to organ, eye and tissue donation and register as donors. “Our partnership with Danny Trejo has opened the doors to a group of talented musicians and producers, ‘Connecting the Dots’ with a greater audience of Trejo fans and local community members that trust Danny as a native Angelino,” said E’Tiffany Jones, Head of Communications and Strategic Partnerships at OneLegacy. “We are excited about the upcoming initiatives between OneLegacy and Danny Trejo’s enterprises, and we are immensely grateful to Danny and his team for using their voice and platform to lift our mission.” The OneLegacy surgical team took the stage for a moment of acknowledgement. Trejo claimed, “There are angels among us,” to which the team received a standing ovation. Hundreds of guests from around Los Angeles visited OneLegacy on Saturday, March 9. The event included a display of lowrider cars, a special meet and greet session with Danny Trejo, merchandise from Trejo’s Music Label and Danny Trejo, raffle prizes provided by OneLegacy and the OneLegacy Ambassadors, a 90’s inspired photo booth and food and drinks provided by Trejo’s Tacos. About OneLegacy OneLegacy is the nonprofit organization dedicated to saving lives through organ, eye and tissue donation in seven counties in Southern California: Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Kern. It serves more than 200 hospitals, 10 transplant centers, a diverse population of 20 million people across the region and waiting recipients across the country. Becoming an eye, organ or tissue donor is easy and can be done by registering online at donateLIFEcalifornia.org/OneLegacy or by “checking YES” at your local DMV.
