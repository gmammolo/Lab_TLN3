  "text": "Kaduna State Governor, Uba Sani, has promised that his administration, in collaboration with security agencies, will ensure the safe return of all those abducted in Kurmin Wali village on Sunday.\nThe governor made the pledge when he led a delegation of senior government officials and heads of security agencies to commiserate with the people of Kurmin Wali. He assured that he would not rest until the abducted are returned home safely.\n“In the last two days, we have been collaborating with the relevant security agencies, comprising the military, the DSS, the police, and the Office of National Security Adviser to ensure the quick return and recovery of our people that were abducted in this very important community,” he stated.\nProtecting Lives Governor Sani reiterated that the number of those kidnapped does not diminish the government’s responsibility. He emphasised that whether one person or 100 people were abducted, the Kaduna State government must protect the lives and properties of its citizens.\n“We are talking about the sanctity of human life and dignity here. And that is the reason we will go to any length, collaborating with the security agencies, to ensure the quick return of our people here in Kurmin Wali,” he said.\nMedical Support and Military Presence He also promised that his administration would cover the medical bills of those injured during the attack.\nThe governor assured that he would liaise with the Minister of Defence, retired General Christopher Musa, to station a military base in the community, given its proximity to known kidnapping hotspots. He explained that while the military has contained insecurity along the Kaduna–Abuja expressway, bandits have found safer havens in the hinterland, noting that Kurmin Wali is close to Rijana town, a known epicentre of banditry.\nInfrastructure Promises Governor Sani further pledged that the road linking Kurmin Wali to the highway would be constructed to improve access to the community. He said the Commissioner of Public Works would conduct the necessary assessment before ground breaking.\nHe also thanked residents for their support and announced plans to build a primary healthcare centre in Kurmin Wali.\nCommunity Appeal In his remarks, the Agwam Kufana, Chief Dauda Titus, recalled receiving a distress call from Kurmin Wali while in church on Sunday.\n“We refused to comment on the incident since Sunday because we did not know the number of those that were kidnapped. We only announced that there was an attack and some people were abducted,” he said.\nChief Titus appealed to the government to expedite the construction of the access road from the highway to Kurmin Wali, noting that the journey should take ten minutes but currently takes 30 minutes.\nHe also called for the provision of other social amenities to improve the welfare of the community.\nLateefah Ibrahim",
