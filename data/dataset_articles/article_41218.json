  "text": "Celebrate Ronald McDonald House Charities at ninth annual Starlight Affair BRYAN, Texas (KBTX) -Enjoy an evening of celebration, while supporting families with ill or injured children at this year’s [Starlight Affair](https://rmhc-ctx.org/events/starlight-affair/). Expect lots of mingling, chef’s tastings, live and silent auctions and live music! The Starlight Affair, happening on April 13 at Traditions Club, benefits the [Ronald McDonald House Charities of Central Texas](https://rmhc-ctx.org/). “It is indoor, outdoor casual boots and jeans, we’ve got fun games,” said Development Manager Tanner Williams. If you’re unable to attend, another way to donate is by taking part in the silent auction. “We’re going to have great things from Caribbean island getaways, to Whiskey Charlie’s has a 15-year-old Pappy Van Winkle that’s going to be in there,” said Williams. Purchase individual tickets [here](https://rmhc-ctx.org/events/starlight-affair/tickets/). For sponsorships, click [here](https://rmhc-ctx.org/events/starlight-affair/participate/).
