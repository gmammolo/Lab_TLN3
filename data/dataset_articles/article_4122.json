  "text": "Kano State Governor, Abba Kabir Yusuf, has praised the Kano State Police Command for its sustained efforts in curbing thuggery and other criminal activities across the state and prompt arrests of suspects linked to the killing of a housewife and her six children.\nThe Governor gave the commendation during a courtesy visit to the Police Command Headquarters in Bompai, where he met with the Commissioner of Police, CP Ibrahim Adamu Bakori.\nHe expressed satisfaction with the recent security improvements and reassured the police leadership of his administration‚Äôs full support in eliminating crime across Kano.\nGovernor Yusuf said he was particularly impressed by the speed at which the suspects in the tragic incident were apprehended.\nAccording to him, he had earlier advised the police to effect arrests within 12 hours, but the command exceeded expectations by apprehending the suspects within six hours.\nHe said that the police also ensured he was directly linked with the suspects as well as the husband and father of the victims.\nThe governor disclosed that he later briefed president Bola Ahmed Tinubu on the professionalism displayed by the Kano State Police Command, noting that the President expressed happiness with the development.\nMaintain the tempo\nHe urged CP Bakori and his team to maintain the tempo and deepen their crime-fighting efforts.\nGovernor Yusuf explained that the visit was his first official engagement with the police command since assuming office in 2023, describing it as a deliberate move to strengthen collaboration between the Kano State Government and the Nigeria Police.\nHe recalled that insecurity, particularly thuggery, banditry, and kidnapping, was one of the major challenges facing his administration at inception, but stressed that such crimes have now reduced significantly.\nHe revealed that cases of thuggery have dropped by about 70 percent under the current police leadership, emphasising that Kano, as the most populous state in the country, must remain peaceful for residents and visitors alike.\nCollective security efforts\nThe governor also cautioned against allowing political differences to undermine collective security efforts.\n‚ÄúI am here to publicly acknowledge your sacrifices and give you moral support,‚Äù Governor Yusuf said. ‚ÄúDespite limited manpower and equipment, you have recorded notable successes.\nMy government will continue to support the police, and concrete improvements in that support will soon be evident.‚Äù\nResponding, CP Ibrahim Adamu Bakori thanked the governor for the visit, describing it as a clear demonstration of his commitment to the Nigeria Police Force.\nHe said the progress recorded in crime control was largely due to the cooperation, encouragement, and guidance received from the state government.\nThe police commissioner said that community policing has been central to security gains in Kano, noting that residents regularly provide credible intelligence.\nHe described the governor‚Äôs visit as a morale booster for officers and men of the command, and reaffirmed the police‚Äôs commitment to sustaining peace and security across the state.\nLateefah Ibrahim",
