  "text": "Portland-based marriage counselor and therapist Jeff Ganter often shares advice for couples on his social media, and in one of his videos he listed five important things to pay attention to after your first fight. The initial phase of a relationship is similar to a honeymoon, however it has to end at some point, usually with the first fight. Of course, arguments are part of a relationship and don't have to be a major problem. However, after the first fight, Jeff says you need to pay attention to the following five things that could be a problem in the future. The other side attacks your character If the other party can't stay focused on the thing that caused the argument and instead makes you feel bad about who you are, it will be difficult to stay on topic and work things out. The other side keeps telling you that your feelings are wrong Feelings are not wrong. You cannot experience an incorrect emotion. Canceling what you feel is not a good start. The other side is insulting you This is a sign of deep disrespect and inability to resolve conflicts in a mature and constructive manner. While it's normal to feel upset, harsh words or insults can damage trust and respect in a relationship and are just mean. The other side becomes the expert on what happened If the other side persistently explains what exactly happened and leaves no room for you and your experience, the whole story is one-sided, which is not good. The other party cannot reconnect and release the argument If the other side becomes cold and cautious, if it continues to punish you, there is a high probability that things will stay like this for a long time and the situation could get even worse.
