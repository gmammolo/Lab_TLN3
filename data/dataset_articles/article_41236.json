  "text": "Veteran defensive lineman Arik Armstead didn’t stay on the open market for long following his release from the San Francisco 49ers.\nAccording to Bleacher Report’s Jordan Schultz and ESPN’s\nAdam Schefter, the Jacksonville Jaguars are signing the 30-year-old Armstead to a massive three-year contract worth $51 million. The reigning NFC Champions cut the longtime fan favorite in a cap-saving move that cleared $18 million against the cap.\nAlso Read:\nBREAKING: Washington Commanders Trade QB Sam Howell To NFC Rival In Surprise Blockbuster Move\nAccording to The Athletic’s Dianna Russini, Armstead also spoke to the\nHouston Texans and Buffalo Bills. Russini added there was a discussion between the 49ers and the Texans for a one-for-one player swap that ended once the AFC South club signed Danielle.\nClick on ‘Follow Us’ and get notified of the most viral NFL stories via Google!\nFollow Us\nSome responding to Russini’s tweet wondered if she was talking about star wide receiver Nico Collins, but she was presumably talking about defensive lineman Maliek Collins. Yesterday, the 49ers acquired Collins via trade in exchange for a seventh-round pick.\nSo after all that, Armstead remains in the AFC South and now joins a Jaguars front seven led by young stars\nJosh Allen and 2022 first overall pick Travon Walker and veteran stalwart Foyesade Oluokon.\nArmstead was drafted 17th overall by the 49ers back in 2015. He had spent each of his first nine years on the west coast, helping San Fran to four NFC Championship Game appearances and two Super Bowl berths.\nFor his career, Armstead has 33.5 sacks, three forced fumbles, six pass defenses and 302 combined tackles.\nAlso Read:\nREPORT: 49ers Looking To Pull Off Blockbuster Trade For Chargers Superstar Player",
