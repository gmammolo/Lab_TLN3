  "text": "The Bulgarian song in the Eurovision Song Contest – “Love Without Borders” was also performed in the European Parliament, after Sofi Marinova was invited to Brussels to participate in the celebration of International Roma Day.\nThe Bulgarian singer sang in the European Parliament in front of MPs and official guests, followed by the Vice President of the European Commission Vivian Reding and the Vice President of the European Parliament Otmar Karas.\nSofi Marinova captivated the audience right from the start. She was in the European Parliament at the invitation of the Bulgarian MEPs from GERB on the occasion of the upcoming International Roma Day. Despite the efforts of European politicians, there is still prejudice against the Roma, says MEP Livia Jaroca, herself from this minority.\nBut to prove that we are all the same, Sofi Marinova continued to excite the diverse audience with Roma music. After the traditional Roma songs, it was time for the European Parliament to hear the Bulgarian proposal for the Eurovision Song Contest – the song “Love Without Borders”.\n#Sofi #Marinova #sang #Love #Borders #European #Parliament",
