  "text": "Child life specialists surprised by Dunkin’, Savannah Bananas SAVANNAH, Ga. (WTOC) - Some hardworking children’s health professionals in Savannah got a tasty treat from the folks at Dunkin’ Donuts. March is Child Life Specialists Month, and the Child Life Specialists at the Dwayne and Cynthia Willet Children’s Hospital at Memorial Health were honored on Thursday. Child Life Specialists are trained to help children with their treatments and improve their experience while they’re in the hospital. They got free iced coffees and refreshments from Dunkin’s mobile sampler truck. Two of them were even surprised with tickets to an upcoming Savannah Bananas game. “I think it’s really a priceless thing to have in a children’s hospital. It really helps calm the patient, but also the family, and they really do an amazing job of explaining things and interacting with the kids to really calm them down, a hospital is a fun place to be in all the time, it’s a little bit scary, and so their job is to essentially make that better for the patient and the family and they do that very well,” Children’s Hospital Administrator Heather Newsome said. There are 12 Child Life Specialists on staff at Memorial Health. Copyright 2024 WTOC. All rights reserved.",
