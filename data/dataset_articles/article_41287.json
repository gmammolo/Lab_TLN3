  "text": "AnalysisFive talking points from Liverpool 6-1 Sparta Prague Liverpool eased into the quarter-finals of the Europa League on Thursday evening with a 6-1 second-leg victory over Sparta Prague. The Reds progressed 11-2 on aggregate overall following an impressive performance during the two legs. Here are five talking points from the Anfield encounter… A flying start It was an incredible opening 14 minutes for the Reds under the Anfield lights. Four goals in the space of seven blistering minutes put the tie beyond doubt, as Liverpool swarmed, hassled, harried, passed and pushed back the Czech champions. Darwin Nunez was the first to net in minute seven, before Bobby Clark got on the scoresheet almost immediately from the Sparta restart. Mohamed Salah made it three in the 10th minute, while Cody Gakpo’s effort rounded out an incredible first quarter of the game only four minutes on from the Egyptian King. In doing so, Liverpool became only the second team to earn a four-goal lead in major UEFA competition in 14 minutes, following Chelsea against Jeunesse Hautcharage in the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1971-72. You have to accept cookies in order to view this content on our site. A mention for Bobby It’s harder to imagine a more impactful period of time for the Liverpool Academy in recent years. The Kirkby youngsters have helped navigate a tricky period of the season with injuries mounting at senior level, contributing to a memorable Carabao Cup final victory over Chelsea last month, while also helping the Reds progress past Southampton in the Emirates FA Cup and continue to challenge for the Premier League title. Clark was the latest of those graduates to see his name in lights in L4, as he netted his first senior goal amid another impressive showing for the midfielder in his fourth start. He could’ve had a second, too, as he danced his way into the box before shooting straight at Sparta goalkeeper Peter Vindahl. “A real performance,” was Jürgen Klopp’s high praise for Clark post-match. Magic Mo hits 20 It’s been a long time coming for Liverpool’s No.11, but Salah was named in a Reds starting line-up once again for Thursday’s fixture. The forward was last picked in Klopp’s XI on New Year’s Day against Newcastle United at Anfield, when he scored a brace in a 4-2 victory over Eddie Howe’s men. Here, he marked the occasion by setting a club record, becoming the first Liverpool player in history to score 20 goals across all competitions for a seventh successive season. Salah’s effort was placed perfectly into the bottom corner amid the flurry of goals in the opening exchanges, with the attacker collecting the ball and finishing neatly with his left foot like he so often does. His night wasn’t done there, either, with Salah also recording a hat-trick of assists and earning Player of the Match. Reds march on in Europe An incredible 28 quarter-finals have now been reached by Liverpool in Europe throughout their entire history. Klopp has overseen six of those visits to the last eight, having taken charge of 89 European matches during his Anfield tenure. Liverpool remain firmly in the hunt for the only available trophy he is yet to lift as Reds boss. There’s no time for celebrations, though, with a quick turnaround for the visit to Manchester United in the FA Cup up next on Sunday afternoon. Europa League draw awaits The Reds won’t have to wait long to find out who they will face in the last eight of the competition. The draw for the final phases of the tournament takes place at 12pm GMT in Switzerland on Friday and will plot out Liverpool’s potential route to the final in Dublin. Klopp’s men will face one of AC Milan, Atalanta, Bayer Leverkusen, Benfica, Marseille, Roma or West Ham United across two legs on April 11 and 18.",
