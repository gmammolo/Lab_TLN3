  "text": "News Department\nOff-duty Bloomingdale detective credited with saving driver after Route 23 crash in Sussex County\nHARDYSTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (Sussex County) — An off-duty Bloomingdale police detective is being credited by his department with helping a driver avoid serious injury after coming upon a crash on Route 23 in Hardyston Township involving a utility pole and a sparking transformer.\nPolice said Detective Dustin Gomes had just finished his shift and was driving home when he encountered the crash, in which a vehicle struck a utility pole and caused a transformer to spark.\nAuthorities said Gomes saw the driver standing amid active sparks near the vehicle and downed electrical hazard. Police said he immediately began directing her to move away and, after repeated commands, the driver followed his directions and got to safety.\nSeconds later, police said, a fireball erupted from the transformer. The department said Gomes’ quick actions likely prevented a far more serious outcome.\nBloomingdale Police Chief Daniel Greenwood praised the detective’s response.\n“Although not on duty at the time of the incident, Det. Gomes immediately recognized a potentially life threatening incident involving downed high voltage wires. His prompt actions to direct the civilian away from danger unquestionably saved her life,” Greenwood said. “This comes to show us that officers are never truly “off duty”. Whether in uniform or not, police officers are trained to assess risk, respond to emergencies, and take action when public safety is at risk.\n“Our department is proud of his response and grateful that no one was seriously injured as a result of his intervention.”",
