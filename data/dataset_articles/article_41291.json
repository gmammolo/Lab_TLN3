  "text": "Local FOP lodge selling shirts to help community The local lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police is selling shirts to support law enforcement causes. VIENNA, W.Va. (WTAP) - Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) Blennerhassett Lodge #79 is selling “Back the Blue MOV” shirts to raise money for several programs they put on for the community. These programs include Shop With A Cop, Children’s Summer Drug-Free Picnic, National Police Week Ceremonies, and more. Vienna Police Chief Mike Pifer is the Lodge Vice President and shares more on how these shirts will help the community. “We thought this t-shirt fundraiser is something that can bring the community together. Our community has been so good with supporting law enforcement and we thought it would be a really fun thing to do where people can come out and purchase a t-shirt and show their support.” The shirts have images of West Virginia and Ohio to bring the entire MOV together. Shirts are available for purchase through the end of May through this [website](https://fop79.itemorder.com/shop/home/?fbclid=IwAR3dAkIFFzoTQtqB5VDTJZVveHWvoaQbbwAFx2liNfSDW2o_3-_1j7_OcBU).
