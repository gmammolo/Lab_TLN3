  "text": "Hands-on approach at Sculpture by the Sea in Cottesloe helps Aboriginal artist's trees grow By Courtney Withers Posted 5h ago 5 hours ago Thu 14 Mar 2024 at 10:15pm Loading YouTube content abc.net.au/news/sculpture-by-the-sea-cottesloe-beach-balga-boola-bigsmob-balga/103585588\nLink copied\nShare Share article\nIn short: Noongar artist Sharyn Egan’s participatory artwork is on display at this year’s Sculpture by the Sea event at Cottesloe Beach. It’s the largest interactive piece in the exhibition’s history, calling on the public to learn weaving techniques to create and add different sections to her sculpture of Balga trees. What's next? The artist’s piece is progressive, meaning it grows in size as the exhibition goes on. Walking along Cottesloe Beach at the annual Sculpture by the Sea exhibition in Perth is an event many have marked in their calendars.\nLining one of WA's most picturesque beaches are 71 weird and wacky sculptures from 14 countries across the world.\nNormally, an estimated 250,000 people flock to admire the pieces from afar, but this year, they're being asked to take part.\n'Appreciating the beauty' Noongar artist Sharyn Egan has returned to Sculpture by the Sea in Cottesloe, now in its 20th year, with a new kind of artwork.\nThe 67-year-old artist was named the 2024 Tourism WA Invited Aboriginal Artist and has brought with her a major piece of public participatory art.\nSharyn Egan says her sculpture started with seven trees and now there are more than 15. ( ABC News: Courtney Withers )\n\"People are really, really into it and this is quite contemporary,\" Ms Egan said.\n\"They're loving it and really loving being part of it and taking photos of their Balga leaves once they're on the sculpture.\"\nHer sculpture, titled Balga Boola – Bigsmob Balga, grows throughout the duration of the exhibition into a blossoming field of Balga trees.\nThe sculpture is formed through daily workshops. ( ABC News: Courtney Withers )\nFor Ms Egan, focusing her sculpture on Balga trees, the Noongar name for grass trees, was a no-brainer.\n\"It's important to me because it's a plant that grows only in Noongar country and the uses are amazing,\" she said.\n\"It's a Swiss Army knife of the bush.\"\nEach woven Balga tree frond is collected through a series of daily workshops with the public, teaching traditional Aboriginal weaving techniques, and is then added to her sculpture.\nMs Egan says Balga trees are the Swiss Army knife of the bush. ( ABC News: Courtney Withers )\n\"I just wanted to share a bit of knowledge with the public so people can appreciate the beauty of them as well — they're just architecturally amazing,\" she said.\nLargest participatory art piece Sculpture by the Sea Founding CEO and artistic director David Handley said Ms Egan's sculpture was \"by far the largest public interactive piece\" in the exhibition's history.\nHe said the exhibition has had interactive elements before, although this interactive element was the biggest and has continued throughout the whole exhibition.\nDavid Handley loves seeing the public embrace the sculpture and its techniques. ( ABC News: Courtney Withers )\n\"It's a wonderful thing to do in so many ways,\" Mr Handley said.\n\"On one hand, it's fun and members of the public are meeting an artist, but on the other hand, this is an artwork that is really important to Sharyn in terms of the Balga tree and its importance for the Noongar people.\"\nHe said the exhibition always encouraged this type of interaction between the artist and the public, but this piece was \"on a whole new scale\".\nSharing good feelings Attendees this year have been pretty pleased to see their new skills on display as Ms Egan's sculpture grows in size.\nIt has also given people an opportunity to learn and embrace culture through art.\nWorkshop attendees Lee Manning (left) and Mal Dunn (right) enjoying the workshop by the beach. ( ABC News: Courtney Withers )\nWorkshop attendee Lee Manning said it was \"lovely to share this with Sharyn\" and learn more about her craft.\n\"When I was growing up, these were called a name we don't say anymore,\" she said.\n\"Of course now we've been enlightened, I'm happy to embrace what they really are — they are a Balga tree.\"\nAnother attendee, Mal Dunn, also enjoyed her time.\n\"I'm not a very crafty person, but this has been really fun. It's very engaging,\" she said.\nMs Egan loves seeing people pointing out their fronds in her sculpture. ( ABC News: Courtney Withers )\nMs Egan said her piece was growing by the day and it was thanks to people who sat with her.\n\"It's just such a nice sharing feel-good feeling,\" she said.\n\"People are just so happy with simple techniques, and stories, and they have a sense of belonging being part of it.\"\nLoading Posted 5h ago 5 hours ago Thu 14 Mar 2024 at 10:15pm Share\nCopy link\nFacebook\nX (formerly Twitter)\nRelated Stories Luminous glass artworks bring troubling histories into the light Underwater sculptures colonised by marine life in diving paradise off Busselton Jetty Art exhibition links apartheid with colonial Australia in Perth show More on: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Art Cottesloe Indigenous (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Indigenous Culture Installation Art Perth Sculpture Visual Art Top Stories Australia to resume funding to UN Palestinian aid agency UNRWA Laura wasn't told her operation could cause infertility.
