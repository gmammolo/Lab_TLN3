  "text": "Red Deer Public Schools provided all Grade 12 students with resources to help ensure success after graduating. These resources were provided through Enriched Academy, which is an online personal financial education program, providing financial literacy training through online courses and tools. The program covers budgeting, credit cards, credit score, student loans, investing, insurance, taxes and much more. “Financial literacy is a vital life skill for everyone and we are thrilled to support our Grade 12s by giving them free lifetime access to Enriched Academy’s EnrichedStart program,” said Shari Jensen, learning services co-ordinator for Red Deer Public Schools. “Through this access they will learn how to manage their personal finances which in turn will prepare them for their journey ahead following graduation. They can continue to use this program as they navigate their way through their years of work and/or post secondary education.” Students who complete the Enriched Academy program will also qualify for scholarship opportunities.
