  "text": "NEW YORK, March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Women We Admire is pleased to announce Top Women Leaders of 2024. In 2023, women occupied 32.2% of senior leadership roles. These include C-suite and director-level positions. Even though there is a long way to go before women and men have equal representation in executive roles, there is no lack of accomplished, seasoned women leaders to celebrate. Many of these women leaders have served some of the top brands in the world. Honoree Katie Clark is currently the Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer for Hormel Foods. She's held previous leadership roles at Mattress Firm, PepsiCo, Tropicana, and Quaker Oats. Additionally, we recognize the career of Leslie Snavely, the President at CHG Healthcare, the largest physician staffing company in the country. In this role, she led the development of CHG's strategic plan and the acquisition of two tech companies. Finally, we acknowledge the amazing work of honoree Addie Teeters, the Vice President of Marketing Communications for the Special Olympics Wisconsin. After an extensive career in marketing communications, Teeters accepted this impactful leadership role in 2023. Please join us in celebrating the accomplishments of these Top Women Leaders of 2024.
