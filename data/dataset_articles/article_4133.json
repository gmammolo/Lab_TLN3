  "text": "MATTA launches TRUST to tackle illegal operators and scams, introducing an AI reporting tool to boost public confidence and industry professionalism.\nKUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Association of Tour and Travel Agents (MATTA) has launched a new initiative called TRUST to combat illegal operators and enhance public confidence in the tourism industry.\nPresident Nigel Wong said the initiative reflects the association’s commitment to fostering trust and professionalism within the sector.\nHe acknowledged the high professionalism within Malaysia’s tourism sector but stressed that current threats make it almost impossible for one body alone to regulate.\n“Online scams and fraud make it almost impossible for one body alone, namely the government, to regulate and enforce the laws,” Wong said at a press conference following the MATTA Membership Summit 2026.\nUnder TRUST, MATTA has developed TravelWatch.ai, an AI-powered reporting platform designed to handle complaints and collect evidence involving illegitimate operators.\nThe system is currently in a proof-of-concept phase and is capable of analysing large volumes of data much faster than traditional manual processes.\nThis data includes videos, audio files, receipts and documents.\nThe initiative also seeks to educate the public on how to identify non-legitimate operators and recognise warning signs of scams.\nWong said TRUST represents MATTA’s commitment to fostering a safe, professional, and sustainable tourism industry in collaboration with government and industry stakeholders.\nIt supports responsible reporting, informed information-sharing and greater transparency while complementing existing enforcement efforts.\nThe event was officiated by Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing.",
