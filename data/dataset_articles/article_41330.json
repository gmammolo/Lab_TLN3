  "text": "The famous cricket player, Mohammed Siraj, recently celebrated his 30th birthday. A favourite among many, this talented bowler recently visited his hometown in Hyderabad, Telangana. The Board of Control for Cricket in India or the BCCI recently filmed a short video of him in his hometown. He regaled the viewers with anecdotes and memories of his childhood days and even got a bit emotional about all that he had to experience during his struggle days.\nMohammed Siraj Visits His Locality In Hyderabad\n🏠 𝙃𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙨𝙥𝙚𝙘𝙞𝙖𝙡 𝙛𝙩.

And the best part? He took his fans along with him. Siraj showed BCCI TV around his hood in Hyderabad. He even showed his neighbourhood in Hyderabad called Eidgah.\nHe showed people the ground where he grew up playing cricket and also his favourite chai spot in the city. At one point in the video, he gets a little sentimental while sharing that he used to work as a catered and helped his father, an autorickshaw driver who was the sole earning member of the family.\nHe said that he used to flip rumali rotis at the job till his hands burned. However, Siraj said he was grateful for the struggles and doesn’t regret it. He says that without those days of struggle, he perhaps wouldn’t have valued his success as much as he does now.\nAlso Read:\nMohammed Siraj Invited RCB Team To His Home To Relish Hyderabadi Biryani\nHere’s What His Fans Had To Say About This Touching Video\nThis literally made me emotional\n— Pallab🇮🇳 (@Pallab200205)\n[March 13, 2024]\nThe video won the hearts of many of his already-adoring fans.
