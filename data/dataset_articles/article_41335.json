  "text": "A charity supporting social services in the Tri-Cities will open its second thrift store next month. The [Low Entropy Foundation](https://lowentropy.org/) will cut the red ribbon for its Port Coquitlam location at 9:45 a.m. on Saturday, April 20, to help fund the group’s [homelessness outreach initiatives](https://lowentropy.org/about-us/empowerhome/). There are 160 people in the Tri-Cities who claim [they don’t have a home](https://www.tricitynews.com/local-news/low-entropy-ramps-up-its-homelessness-outreach-in-the-tri-cities-8303242), according to a recent count. Today, March 14, co-executive director Vanessa Wideski told the Tri-City News that its second Thrift & Fund store is in response to the success of its inaugural shop in the Burquitlam Plaza, which opened last June [at 408-552 Clarke Rd](https://www.tricitynews.com/local-business/charity-opens-bigger-thrift-store-in-older-coquitlam-strip-mall-6967863). It is one of the last remaining businesses in the strip mall that’s [poised for redevelopment](https://www.tricitynews.com/local-news/morguard-ready-to-break-ground-at-burquitlam-plaza-6464912). The PoCo location, [at 107B-2748 Lougheed Hwy.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/2748+Lougheed+Hwy.,+Port+Coquitlam,+BC+V3B+6P2/@49.2721825,-122.7915173,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x54867f4b3dc59565:0x223d84a499766d51!8m2!3d49.272179!4d-122.7889424!16s%2Fg%2F11bw4jjjzs?entry=ttu), by Bevees and De Dutch, will be “the same model as our Burquitlam store, but hopefully better,” she said. “This store will have more focus on the customer experience, building community and connecting with local businesses owners in the area.” Wideski said a store manager, sales associates and volunteers are now sought for the PoCo branch. Applicants can contact Low Entropy [via its website](https://lowentropy.org/). As well, donations of gently used household items will be accepted started April 1. Shoppers have a chance to win a $50 gift card at the grand opening. Doors opens at 10 a.m. on April 20. To register, [visit the website](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdnaDemLhp53JCWrva1ug0Z9S_MkyvjQADRMXV2W9f9WAFDpg/viewform). The PoCo store hours will be Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., and weekends from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.",
