  "text": "A lucky Australian has won $40million in Thursday night’s Powerball draw.\nThe winning numbers were 5, 15, 24, 27, 30, 32, and 35. The Powerball was 2.\nThe big prize as won by a man in Fairfield, Sydney, was ‘speechless’ after being told he’d bagged the life-changing sum.\nThe big prize as won by a man in Fairfield, Sydney, was ‘speechless’ after being told he’d bagged the life-changing sum (file picture)\nHe initially ignored calls from lottery officials and, once he finally answered, assumed he was being pranked by his mates.\n‘I didn’t even know I had a ticket into tonight’s draw until you called,’ the winner, who wishes to remain anonymous, said.\n‘I had a headache before, but now I’m not even thinking about that. I hope you keep putting a smile on people’s faces like you’ve just put a smile on mine.’\nHe said he’d be using some of the money to help other people.\n‘There’s plenty of people that need help that I know of. That’s the first thing I’ll be doing,’ he said.\n‘Otherwise, we’ll just have to see what happens and let it sink in. To be honest, I’m speechless, I don’t know what to say!’\nThe jackpot doubled to $40million after no one took home the big prize of $20million last week.\nThree division two winners will be $225,000 better off tomorrow.\nA total of 62 people matched six numbers and the Powerball, handing them $13,542.50 each.\nA lucky Australian has won $40million in Thursday night’s Powerball draw\nLast month, a Melbourne man drafted his resignation letter after winning more than $2million in a TattsLotto draw.\nThe man from Glen Eira, in the city’s south-east, held one of the seven division one winning entries after purchasing an 18-game QuickPick ticket online.\nHe was oblivious to his good fortune after his numbers were picked on Saturday and only became aware when an official from The Lott called him on Sunday to confirm he had won $2.8million.\n‘This is massive,’ the winner said. ‘I’m just going to retire now.’\nThe jackpot doubled to $40million after no one took home the big prize of $20million last week\n‘I’ll have to write a letter to my boss! I was going to retire in a couple of years, but now I can just do it.’\nThe winning numbers in TattsLotto draw 4441 on Saturday were 42, 2, 12, 13, 1 and 20, while the supplementary numbers were 3 and 15.\nEach of the seven division one winners pocketed $2,857,142.86.\nThe Victorian man said the cash prize ‘will come in handy’.\n‘I’ve been worrying about where to from here, but now I don’t have to worry,’ he said.\n‘Usually I don’t answer the phone if I don’t know the number, but I’m glad I took this call!’\nHis run-in with good fortune comes after two Australians won the record breaking $200million Powerball draw at the start of February.\nOne of the division one winners was from Queensland while the second hailed from NSW.\nThe NSW mum who won half of the eye-watering jackpot said she planned to quit her job immediately and travel the world.\n‘It’s a lot of money, a lot of money to fathom,’ the woman told The Lott official.\n‘I mean you joke about winning but never expect it to happen to you.\n‘My partner is here with me now, he’s a bit in shock. He loves his job, so I don’t know if he’ll be retiring.’\nRead more",
