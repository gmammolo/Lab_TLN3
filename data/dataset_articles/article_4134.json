  "text": "Inspector-General of Police stresses the importance of the School Liaison Officers initiative and community cooperation in ensuring a safe learning environment.\nTAPAH: The Royal Malaysia Police continues to prioritise crime prevention and school safety through its School Liaison Officers initiative.\nInspector-General of Police Datuk Seri Mohd Khalid Ismail said the programme, implemented since 2018, adopts a comprehensive approach to safety issues in schools.\nHe said PPS officers serve as the primary link between the police and school communities.\nTheir role includes providing early crime prevention education and enhancing students’ legal awareness.\n“PDRM takes seriously issues such as bullying, school violence, drug abuse, juvenile crime and the negative influence of social media,” he said.\nHe stressed that school safety requires cooperation among teachers, parents, students, the community and the police.\nMohd Khalid was speaking at the ‘Back to School with the Inspector-General of Police’ programme at Sekolah Kebangsaan Bidor.\nHe emphasised that early education on crime prevention is crucial in shaping discipline from a young age.\n“I would like to stress that manners and moral values play an important role in developing balanced individuals,” he added.\nHe advised students to respect teachers, love parents and use social media wisely.\nThe IGP called on parents and the local community to serve as strategic partners to schools and PDRM.\nHe said collective support is vital for safeguarding children and nurturing their positive development.\n“PDRM will remain committed to strengthening strategic cooperation with the Ministry of Education Malaysia and relevant agencies,” he said.\nThis is to ensure the PPS initiative remains effective and impactful nationwide.",
