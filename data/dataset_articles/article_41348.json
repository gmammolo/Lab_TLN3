  "text": "Summary - Colman Domingo's Oscar nomination validates the exceptional talent that \"The Walking Dead\" fans have always known he had. - Colman Domingo's Best Actor nomination for \"Rustin\" showcases his prowess and may lead to a significant rise in his career. - Despite being a standout villain in \"Fear the Walking Dead,\" Colman Domingo receives overdue recognition for his remarkable acting. The 2024 Oscars didn't just validate but celebrated a widespread consensus that’s persisted among The Walking Dead fans for almost a decade. As a series-based franchise encompassing the performers and storylines of The Walking Dead TV show, the Fear the Walking Dead spinoff, the Walking Dead: World Beyond limited series, and more, The Walking Dead rarely warrants a nod from the film-centered acknowledgment of the Oscars. On special occasions, when a TWD alum traverses into film acting and dominates their movie role quite like they did in their franchise role, the Oscars will acknowledge their exceptional talent. It happened to be the case for TWD actor Steven Yeun - after Glen Rhee's death in TWD season 7 , Yeun left the franchise, later starring in the 2020 drama Minari. For his performance in the must-watch Minari movie , he received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, which endorsed the acting talent that every TWD fan already knew he had. At the Oscars this year, another alum of the TWD franchise was recognized for their remarkable acting talent, even though it was nearly 10 years in the making for franchise fans and even longer for admirers of the actor's 30-year-long career. [ ](/oscars-2024-winners-list/) Awards season comes to a close with the 96th Academy Awards on ABC honoring the best in film from 2023 – see the full list of Oscar winners. [ Oscars 2024 Winners List ](/oscars-2024-winners-list/) 2024's Oscars Finally Recognized Colman Domingo's Acting Talent The Oscars finally recognized Colman Domingo's acting prowess with a Best Actor nomination for his performance in the biographical drama film Rustin, about the true story of the civil rights activist Bayard Rustin . Domingo took on the lead role of Rustin's revolutionary with electric appeal, earning him a nod beside the likes of Jeffrey Wright (American Fiction), Paul Giamatti (The Holdovers), and Bradley Cooper (Maestro). Domingo lost the award to Cillian Murphy of Oppenheimer, though the Rustin actor's place in the running was still an incredible testament to his exceptional career. Since he started acting in 1995, Domingo has become a distinguished actor in both TV and film. His film credits include Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning movie Lincoln, Steven Caple Jr.'s Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, and Blitz Bazawule's 2023 The Color Purple remake, among plenty of others. Domingo's TV cred is just as great, as he has performed in series such as Law & Order, BoJack Horseman, The Knick, the popular sensation Euphoria, and, of course, TWD'sFear the Walking Dead, which saw him play antagonist Victor Strand for a whopping 109 episodes between 2015 and 2023. Victor Strand Was Quietly The Walking Dead's Best Villain Performance Domingo's Strand, who frequently stooped to selfish and wicked ways, was quietly one of the TWD franchise's best villain performances. The character often flew under the radar because he existed in Fear the Walking Dead, and the obstruction of the original The Walking Dead series' sheer magnitude in both length and support, as well as all ofTWD's offshoot shows, distracted from him getting the recognition he deserved. Nevertheless, Strand is often considered a favorite franchise villain, saluted for the character's wildly compelling story arc and Domingo's formidable performance as him. Strand started in Fear the Walking Dead as a conman before stooping lower and lower across the seasons to remain alive, all while increasingly shocking audiences with his wildly determined hustle to survive without any remorse. Frequently, the character would engage in startling acts of villainy - like betraying friends, killing innocents, or threatening haven settlements - to a point where audiences thought FTWD's Strand was beyond redemption . However, in the end, Strand grew remorse for his past, completinga crowd-pleasing character arc made better by Colman's solidly convincing performance. [ Fear the Walking Dead ](/tag/fear-the-walking-dead/) A prequel to AMC's hit series, Fear the Walking Dead, follows new characters and explores the city of Los Angeles as the world transforms into the horrifying zombie apocalypse that changes the world forever. The first half of the series follows a found family that rebuilds who they are to adapt and survive the new world order. The second half follows Morgan Jones, a survivor from the original franchise who joins the original surviving cast members. - Cast - Cliff Curtis , Frank Dillane , mercedes mason , Elizabeth Rodriguez , Kim Dickens , Ruben Blades , lorenzo james henrie , Alycia Debnam-Carey , Colman Domingo - Release Date - August 23, 2015 - Seasons - 8 - Network [AMC](/tag/amc/) - Streaming Service(s) [Hulu](/tag/hulu/), [Amazon Prime Video](/tag/amazon-prime-video/) - Franchise(s) - The Walking Dead - Writers - Ian Goldberg , [Robert Kirkman](/tag/robert-kirkman/), dave erickson , Andrew Chambliss - Showrunner - dave erickson , Ian Goldberg , Andrew Chambliss Colman Domingo's Oscar Nomination May Be The Start Of A Career Rise Despite having a successful career beyond TWD, Domingo's Oscar nomination could shepherd a new career rise. The Oscar nod places the full scope of the actor's talent on everyone's radar, not just fans of The Walking Dead or followers of his acting career. Since the Oscar season started, Domingo has already been regarded as the most popular candidate for the MCU's Kang recast , a role in which his background as Strand would verily prepare him to play the Marvel supervillain with excellent finesse. If his upcoming roles don't provoke critical acclaim like his part in the Oscar-nominated Rustin movie did, then they will inevitably lead to something bigger for Colman Domingo. Even if a role in the MCU doesn't transpire for Domingo, he's bound to get cast in something just as massive. The actor is starring in upcoming parts quite similar to his Oscar-nominated role, as he will soon star in the biographical films Michael as Joe Jackson and a Nat King Cole biopic as the legendary singer himself. If his upcoming roles don't provoke critical acclaim like his part in the Oscar-nominated Rustin movie did, then they will inevitably lead to something bigger for Colman Domingo.",
