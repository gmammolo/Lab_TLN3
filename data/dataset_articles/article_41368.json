  "text": "It seems like every time you look, Notre Dame freshman phenom Hannah Hidalgo is landing another honor. Now, she can add Naismith Award semifinalist to the list. Hidalgo was one of 10 semifinalists announced Thursday for the award given to the top player in the country. That group will be cut to four finalists March 26 right after the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament is completed.\nA Hidalgo win would be the second for a freshman after fellow semifinalist Paige Bueckers of UConn won it in 2021. It also would be the second time a Notre Dame player has won it, joining ruth riley during the Irish’s 2001 national championship season.\nHidalgo already faces some stiff competition in a field that includes ACC Player of the Year Elizabeth Kitley of Virginia Tech and fellow freshman phenom JuJu Watkins of USC. But of course, all eyes will be on Iowa’s Caitlin Clark to see if she can repeat as the winner of this award, and it would be a shock if she didn’t.\nRegardless of what happens though, it’s one more thing for Hidalgo to be proud of, and this probably won’t be the last time she gets this far for this award.\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on Twitter, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\nFollow Geoffrey on Twitter: @gfclark89\nBRACKET MADNESS: Enter USA TODAY's NCAA tournament bracket contest, create a pool and invite your friends!",
