  "text": "NATURAL BRIDGE — Homeowner Karen Taylor and her grandson, were displaced, when a fire totally destroyed their home at 41980 County Route 41. Feb. 29.\nA spaghetti dinner at a cost of $12, local business gift certificate raffle and bake sale will be held starting at 11:30 a.m. at the Natural Bridge Fire Hall, 27570 High St., Natural Bridge. Pre-orders are available by contacting Casey St. Louis at 315-741-0406. Meals are eat in or take out.\nThere will be a Beach Party Benefit 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. April 6 with music raffles, lottery tree and cornhole tournament at the American Legion, 415 West St., Carthage. Food will be available at a cost of $10 with the options of hot dogs, hamburger or sausage sandwiches.\nOn the scene, Natural Bridge Second Assistant Fire Chief Ronald R. Ward said that one firefighter arrived at the scene ahead of everyone else and gave the other crew members a heads up that there was a fully engulfed structure fire.\nWard said there was a manpower issue getting their truck to the scene since the call came in during the middle of the afternoon on a weekday.\nThe cold and wind resulted in an engine freezing up.\n“This wind today is atrocious on all of us,” he said.\nOne firefighter was injured on the scene but was treated and released. No other injuries were reported.\nWard said some animals died in the fire.\nFirefighters used foam to put the fire out. Ward said this is because foam will smother the fire.\n“Their choice was to use the foam to try to knock it down,” he said.\nThe fire spread to a nearby camper, which is also a total loss.\nWard said there was “a hiccup” getting water to the scene, but said “they were quickly resolved,” Ward said.\nNatural Bridge Fire Department responded with mutual aid from Carthage, West Carthage, Deferiet, Castorland and Rutland fire departments. Carthage Rescue Squad was also on the scene.\nThe cause of the fire is under investigation.\nJohnson Newspapers 7.1",
