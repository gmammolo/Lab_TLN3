  "text": "Forget Spiderman, Superman and Wonder Woman, did you know that we all secretly possess our own superpower? Yep, that's right! And we're not just talking about the usual (and rather unrealistic) choices of invisibility, ability to fly or read minds...let's face it, those are never gonna happen. Instead let's focus on a superpower that you already have; maybe you just didn't know you had it until now! Keep reading for your secret superpower reading, brought to you by ï»¿â€Œï»¿ [YourTango](#)ï»¿â€Œï»¿. Snapshot Survey Thanks for sharing your thoughts! Please subscribe for your personalized newsletter: ARIES (March 21 - April 19) Your superpower is that you're fearless. You probably would run into a burning building to save someone. You take risks, are courageous, and on top of that, you're somewhat of a daredevil. Actually, I'm not sure you're not a superhero, though you certainly have all the personality characteristics for one. TAURUS (April 20 - May 20) Your superpower is your concentration. Once you put your mind to something, there isn't anything you can't achieve. If you could market your focus and drive, it would always sell out. No one should attempt to stand in your way when you're concentrating on a goal because you'll just steamroll right over them. GEMINI (May 21 - June 20) Your superpower is your adaptability. You can fit in and make a name for yourself anywhere. It doesn't matter if you're the new kid in school or a new hire, but it won't take long for you to endear yourself to everyone around you and to rise to the top. You're not thrown by something new; in fact, it excites and challenges you. You may not be able to be a chameleon and blend into the environment but being able to adapt to anything and thrive is amazing. CANCER (June 21 - July 22) You have the superpower of insight. You're able to read between the lines of what people say and do and understand what's really going on. You're able to read people's hearts and understand what they feel, even when they're confused or don't have the ability to be honest with themselves. You can easily get to the essence of the situation and solve the difficulty. LEO (July 23 - August 22) You have the superpower of influence. You're a natural leader and people tend to look up to you and follow you. When you're front and center â€” the place where you feel most at home â€” people can't help but look at you. You guide and influence but you don't take advantage of your power for your own gain... at least you try not to. VIRGO (August 23 - September 22) Your superpower is the ability to fix what is broken; whether it's a teacup or a heart, you instinctively know what to do to make it whole again. You are a healer and a fixer and you make people feel better, sometimes from the things that you do and other times just by your presence. LIBRA (September 23 - October 22) Manifesting is your superpower. You're able to make things happen and get the things you want to the sheer power of visualizing and focusing. Call it the power of positivity or maybe it's just that by believing you bring great things into your life. Keep doing what you're doing because it's working. SCORPIO (October 23 - November 21) Your superpower is your natural charisma. You [draw people to you with your charm](https://www.yourtango.com/200937082/are-your-astrology-signs-sexually-compatible) and your appeal. You seem to have the \"it\" factor, which, coupled with your natural air of mystery, [makes you nearly irresistible](https://www.yourtango.com/2014232483/12-sex-positions-fitting-each-zodiac-sign). You're magnetic and once someone is in your presence, they find it difficult to leave. SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21) Your superpower is your openness which is why you're able to travel the world and never feel anything but at home. You're interested in unfamiliar traditions and customs and you constantly want to learn and experience more. You're not shy but genuinely curious about people. You may not be a sociologist but you're on a never-ending quest to learn about humans in all their environments. CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19) Your superpower is your humor. You're able to see things in a humorous light and that saves you time and time again. When someone seems to be going down a negative path, you're able to bring them back by saying something funny. You'd probably say that the ability to see the lighter side of life has saved you again and again. AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18) Your superpower is the ability to reinvent yourself. When you feel as if you're at the end of your rope and you don't give in to feelings of hopelessness, you start all over again. If you're not getting the respect you need from your work, you get a new job, and if your relationship has soured, you do what you can to save it. But if it's unsavable, you work on yourself. PISCES (February 19 - March 20) Your superpower is your imagination and your ability to create things from nothing. By seeing something in your mind's eye, you're able to translate it to the real world. Your ideas and creativity make you stand apart from most people. If you're in a tense situation, you can retreat to that happy place in your head and feel better.",
