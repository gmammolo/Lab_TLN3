  "text": "“Our Sita is not here with us but we will be grateful if someone else can see through her eyes.” A day after the 22-year-old was killed when a car ploughed through a weekly market in East Delhi’s Mayur Vihar Phase III, her brother said they would donate her eyes to a patient in need. The Delhi Police on Thursday apprehended a 17-year-old boy who was allegedly driving the car that rammed into shoppers at the market, killing Sita and injuring six others on Wednesday night. His friend, who was also in the car, was apprehended as well. According to Sita’s family, she and her elder sister Puja Devi stepped out of their house in Khoda Colony around 7.30 pm on Wednesday to buy vegetables at the market. Thirty minutes later, the car hit Sita from behind, causing injuries to the right side of her body, even as her sister narrowly escaped. She is survived by her parents and five siblings, three of them brothers. At the mortuary of Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital, Sita’s brother Kapil told The Indian Express, “. we had no idea about the incident until Puja called us and said a vehicle has gone on a rampage and is hitting every person in sight. she said she somehow swerved to the right and saved herself but Sita was hit.” Sita, her family members said, used to work at a fridge manufacturing factory in East Delhi and used to earn around Rs 7,000 a month. She was also pursuing an ITI course. “. We had just bought a few vegetables when we heard loud noises and screams from behind. I saw a silver car driving in a zig-zag manner and hitting fruit, cloth and bangle stalls. passersby were fleeing out of its way but by the time we could react, the vehicle was already close to us. Sita had fallen unconscious at the spot and was taken to the hospital by police and passersby,” said Puja. Meanwhile, The Indian Express spoke to those injured who could only recall seeing a vehicle rushing towards the busy market and crashing into everything in sight. Sarita (30), who was at the market with her two children, sustained a fracture in her right leg. “I had come to buy clothes for a wedding next month in my village in UP. when the vehicle suddenly came towards me. I managed to push my children out of the way but it hit my right leg. I lost consciousness after a while but I remember that the driver kept accelerating.” Dorjan (55), who had come to eat street food, sustained head injuries and a broken right leg after the vehicle rammed into him and the stall he was eating at. “I left home around 8 pm to eat and take a stroll. the vehicle crashed into anything in its way,” he added.",
