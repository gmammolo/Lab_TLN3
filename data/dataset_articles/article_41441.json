  "text": "Forget all the home runs Major League Baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani often hits.\nFans have been curious over the past few weeks just who Shohei Ohtani sees when he runs home for a night in front of the television.\nIn other, far less confusing words?\nWho the heck is Shohei Ohtani’s wife?!?\nShohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers warms up on deck during the fifth inning of the MLB spring game at Camelback Ranch on March 12, 2024 in Glendale, Arizona. (Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images) The former California Angels pitcher/designated hitter — who signed a $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers this past offseason — surprised fans last month when he casually announced he was married.\nOhtani didn’t identity his wife at the time, however.\nOn Thursday, though, Ohtani shared a photo with his new bride on his Instagram Story Thursday, according to Fox Sports.\n“Shohei Ohtani and his wife, basketball player Mamiko Tanaka, are heading to the Seoul Series!” Fox on MLB posted on Twitter, including a screen grab of the photo, as you can see below.\nSHOHEI OHTANI’S WIFE REVEAL!!!\nHe posted this photo on IG with Japanese basketball player Mamiko Tanaka pic.twitter.com/doaCIwmnVk\n— Shawn Spradling (@Shawn_Spradling) March 14, 2024 So, just who is Mamiko Tanaka ?\nTanaka is 27 years old.\nShe is a 5-foot-11 Japanese center, who played for the Fujitsu Red Wave from 2019 to 2023 after a collegiate career at Waseda University and Tokyo Seitoku University.\nThe professional athlete most recently averaged 7.8 points and 6 rebounds per game, which isn’t shabby at all. Seems like a solid role player.\nShohei Ohtani probably hit a home run during this plate appearance. (Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images) Ohtani previously said he had married “someone from my Native country Japan,” stating through his interpreter in February:\n“She is a Japanese woman, and I don’t really feel comfortable talking about when I got married, the exact date and stuff.”\nNow, though, we’ve learned that Ohtani has known Tanaka for about four years.\nHe decided this week to finally reveal her identity in order to make sure nothing about his personal life served as a distraction over the upcoming baseball season.\nShohei Ohtani in the dugout during spring training. (Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images) Ohtani is a two-time American League Most Valuable Player.\nDue to his abilities both as a pitcher and a hitter, many consider the Dodgers superstar to be the most talented baseball player in the history of this great sport.\nOhtani, who will turn 30 on July 5 and who signed the biggest deal in sports history in December, smashed 44 home runs last year and hit .304.\nHe won’t be available to pitch in 2024 as he recovers from surgery to repair his right UCL in October 2023.",
