  "text": "WORCESTER, Mass. – Joshua Sowden says a firsthand experience opened his eyes to the struggles of being homeless.\n\"My stepmother's sister was living in a homeless shelter and we went there,\" Joshua said. \"We gave her son an Easter basket, and I asked if the other kids had Easter. She said, 'no, unless they're donated.' And I really wanted to help out.\"\nFrom that one interaction, Sowden, a sixth-grader in Worcester, has only seen his passion grow. This year will be his fourth handing out baskets to homeless children in the area. What started with one basket to a family member has now grown to an estimated 310 he'll hand out in 2024.\nWhat You Need To Know Worcester sixth-grader Joshua Sowden is handing out Easter baskets to local homeless children\nThis year, he plans to hand out 310 baskets\nHis message hits home, as he and his family experienced homelessness last year\nInfants through 12 year olds will receive baskets \"It feels really nice to know that they're going to enjoy this year,\" Joshua said.\nThe young boy's message hit home even more last year, when he and his family were facing homelessness.\n\"We were told that we had to move, and we ended up in a hotel from the end of April until the week before Christmas,\" said Joshua's stepmother, Crystal Sowden.\nInfants through 12 year olds will receive baskets this year.\nWhen Spectrum News 1 paid Joshua a visit, his living room was reminiscent of a loading dock, with Amazon boxes full of Easter-themed gifts lining the floor.\nThis year, though, he's getting help from his friend, Jacob.\n\"One day I came here, and they had all the boxes,\" said Jacob. \"And I was like, \"What's up with the boxes?\" They told me the story and they asked me if I wanted to help. And I said 'yeah.'\"\n\"It makes me really happy that other people want to be involved in this and help out,\" responded Joshua.\nJoshua will hand out the baskets at two shelters, one in Worcester and the other in Hudson. They'll also be donated to kids living in the hotel Joshua lived in last year.\n\"Knowing what a difference it's going to give these kids, especially after what we saw last year. Being able to give them a smile, even for a couple hours, is huge,\" said Crystal Sowden.\nThey'll hand them out on March 23, hoping to be a beam of light for some who may be in a dark time of their lives.",
