  "text": "Barron Trump 'saved London woman's life by calling police when she Facetimed him during attack'\nDonald Trump’s son Barron “saved a woman’s life” after he saw her being attacked by her ex-boyfriend on FaceTime, a court heard.\nMr Trump, 19, was on a video call with a “girl [he] knew” when he allegedly saw former MMA fighter Matvei Rumiantsev, 22, beating up the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons.\nThe US president’s youngest son then called 999 to alert the police, warning that it was “really an emergency”, the court was told, according to the Metro.\nIt was heard in Snaresbrook Crown Court, east London, that Mr Rumiantsev was allegedly jealous of the woman’s friendship with Mr Trump.\nMr Rumiantsev is on trial for alleged attacks against her. He has been charged with assault, ABH, two counts of rape, intentional strangulation and perverting the course of justice, which he denies.\nThe dramatic emergency call was made on January 18 at 2.23am last year.\nA recording was played in court, in which Mr Trump can be heard saying: “I just got a call from a girl I know. She’s getting beaten up.”\nHe gave operators her address and then said: “It’s really an emergency, please. I got a call from her with a guy beating her up.”\nThe Mirror reported that Mr Rumianstev had allegedly grabbed her by the hair, shoved her onto the floor and told her “you are not worth anything”, kicking her in the stomach and saying misogynistic comments.\nThe woman told the jury she was on her knees “begging”, and after the call with Mr Trump she found the strength to get back up again.\nWhen police showed up at her house they asked the woman to verify that someone called from the US about the incident.\nThe woman called Mr Trump who explained to officers: “She called me. I picked up the phone expecting a nice hello or something.\n“I just saw a ceiling and could hear screaming. I could see a guy’s head on the phone, and then the camera turns to her crying and getting hit.”\nShe said the call with Mr Trump that ended up saving her life was “a sign from God”.\nThe woman told the court: “He helped save my life. That call was like a sign from God at that moment.”\nShe alleged Mr Rumiantsev rape her twice, on the day of the video call on January 18, and in November 2024.\nBut the defence’s lawyer Sasha Wass KC, said her account was a “complete fabrication” and suggested that she had behaved in an aggressive way.\nMs Wass said: “You invented this wholly untrue and fabricated account that he raped you on those two occasions – you were never raped.”\nThe trial continues.",
