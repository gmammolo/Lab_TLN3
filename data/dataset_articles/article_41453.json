  "text": "PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. – A South Florida woman is feeling joy and relief after her late husbands ashes have been returned.\nThey were stolen from her Pembroke Pines home earlier this week along with a safe.\nNow, Maria Araya said she is able to sleep in peace.\n“I feel so happy, I can’t believe it,” she said. “It’s like a miracle that he’s back to me again.”\nOn Wednesday, Local 10 News reported on the crooks who broken into Arya’s home.\nThey cut through the screen of her back porch and smashed through an older window to get inside.\nThe crooks than took a small safe with money and documents inside, but that’s not what Arya was concerned about.\nRather, the most meaningful property was a memorial lockbox with the ashes of her late husband Juan Araya, who passed away nine years ago.\n“I asked God, ‘please God, use your power and blessing, bring my husband’s ashes to me,’” she said.\nHer prayers were answered after two city workers located the memorial lockbox down the road from her home.\n“He’s like a treasure,” she said. “He was my angel in life, now he’s an angel in heaven,” Araya said.\nCopyright 2024 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.",
