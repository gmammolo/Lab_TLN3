  "text": "International Desk, Mar 13 (EFE).- Employees of an environmental organization in Virginia, United States, dressed up as foxes to care for a baby fox they had rescued after it was orphaned. In a video posted on Facebook this week, the director of the Richmond Wildlife Center, Melissa Stanley, can be seen dressed up as a fox to prevent the animal from getting used to humans. The little mammal was fed on a stuffed fox that staff hoped would resemble its mother. “It’s important to make sure that the orphans that are raised in captivity do not become imprinted upon or habituated to humans,” the wildlife center said in a Facebook post. \"To prevent that, we minimize human sounds, create visual barriers, reduce handling, reduce multiple transfers amongst different facilities, and wear masks for the species,\" the post said. Rescuers initially mistook the mammal for a cat but later realized it was a newborn fox kit, so they then handed it over to the center on Feb. 29. The baby fox arrived weighing 80 grams. Those who rescued it handled it with their bare hands, which the centre said was risky for both the wild animal and the people who found it. According to the center, it's important to wear gloves when handling infected mammals found in the wild, such as dogs and cats. This precaution will help avoid the need to euthanize the animal and send it for rabies testing. \"While the risk of transmission of rabies from this newborn fox kit is minimal given statistics on foxes in the city of Richmond, it has no teeth and was dehydrated with reduced saliva in its mouth, the risk is not zero,\" the center said.
