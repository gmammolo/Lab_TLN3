  "text": "2 hours ago\nAs an independent, I have decided to vote for Joe Biden for President, not because I fully endorse his policies. It is that Donald Trump does not deserve support.\nMr. Trump has shown that he should not be President because he promoted an attack on our Capitol, undermined our legal system and refused to accept his legal, documented defeat at the polls. He says he has reasons and facts for his actions. He doesn’t. His immaturity and irrationality are clearly outlined in a book by his niece.\nThat is enough not to support Mr. Trump — ever.\nHere a few more:\nAs a man, I cannot vote for someone who has mistreated women for decades.\nAs a Christian, I cannot support someone who has exhibited so many unChristian and immoral values. I know the Biblical story of casting the first stone, however, I have admitted many of my own sins and errors. But, Mr. Trump, to my knowledge, has never admitted being wrong. That shows a very serious lack of character and extreme immorality.\nAs a veteran, I cannot vote for someone who has ridiculed veterans, including a war hero like the late Sen. John McCain. That behavior by Mr. Trump is particularly shameful because he got out of serving through a minor medical deferment.\nFinally, as the brother of a disabled man, I will never support — and am having trouble forgiving — someone who mocked and laughed at a disabled reporter in front of a nationwide audience. Mr. Trump never apologized. His action is reprehensible, showing his true character — or the lack of it.\nMr. Trump is not worthy of my support, and I trust others across the country agree. I ask them to speak out and be heard.\nStan Stelter\nBISMARCK, ND\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
