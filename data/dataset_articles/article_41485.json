  "text": "TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - Work on a special playground in Rossville is wrapping up just in time for kids heading back to school. Community members, local businesses, and classmates of Makalyn Aubert came together to build a new playground in her honor. “It’s just, I’m so excited,” Melissa Aubert, Makalyn’s mother, said. “We’ve worked so hard and we’ve had so many people help us. We have several kids here from Makalyn’s class that are helping today, and they’re super excited for Spring Break to be over and school to start on Monday so they can play on it.” Aubert passed away in 2020 at 7 years old. Four years later, her wish for a new playground at Rossville Elementary was granted. The work came just in time for pieces in Makalyn’s favorite colors, purple and turquoise, to become available. “It’s been a huge project, and there’s been a lot of stress the first couple of days if this is all going to take place, and it’s all turned out awesome,” Makalyn’s father, Kenny Aubert, said. Everyone helping out took time to spruce up the pre-school playground as well. Copyright 2024 WIBW. All rights reserved.",
