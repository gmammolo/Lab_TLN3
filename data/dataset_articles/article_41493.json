Gusty winds and small hail are possible. Low 64F. Winds SE at 10 to 15 mph. Chance of rain 80%.\nUpdated: March 14, 2024 @ 4:53 pm\nA Temple used book sale that ended March 2 generated $30,000 to be used for library programming.\nThe Friends of the Temple Public Library said its Mid-Winter Used Book Sale at the Temple Public Library was a success.\n“We are so grateful for the community support, which makes our twice-a-year sales a success. Temple area residents donate books throughout the year, renew their annual Friends memberships and repeatedly shop the sales,” Book Sale Co-Chairs Diann Anderson, Kathy Harrington and Heather Rodke said in a statement.\nAbout 40,000 books were available for purchase at the sale, which Friends volunteers spent months organizing. Books were sorted by categories — fiction, mystery, biography, history, etc. — and displayed on tables filling the McLane Room on the library’s third floor.\nThe sale offered vintage books, record albums, DVDs, CDs, classic fiction, religious books, children’s books, textbooks, non-fiction and cookbooks. Most items sold for $2 or less, although some vintage and selected books were priced higher.\n“This year, we received book donations from military history buffs that were a real hit at the Mid-Winter sale,” Rodke said.\nAdded Anderson: “This sale offers the greatest bargains in Central Texas, and many book lovers, homeschoolers and teachers take advantage of the affordable prices.”\nThe Friends of the Temple Library, organized in 1965, holds annual book sales twice a year that serve as the organization’s primary fundraising events.\nProceeds from the sales made it possible for the Friends to donate funds for library renovations, children’s summer reading programs, library bookmobiles and other library needs.\n“Each year, the Friends provide $25,000 or more to fund the library director’s wish list,” the organization said. “Recently, the Friends contributed $83,000 toward the purchase of a replacement bookmobile.”\nIndividual Friends annual memberships are available for $10 and can be purchased year-round at the library circulation desk or on the Friends website:\nhttps://friendsofthetemplepubliclibrary.org/join-the-friends. The organization accepts clean and gently used books year-round at the library circulation desk.\nThe organization said its next book sale will be the Labor Day Used Book Sale, which begins with the Friends members-only preview on Aug. 26. The sale will open to the public on Aug. 28.",
