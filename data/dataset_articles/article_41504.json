  "text": "From Abby Newman's Instagram/buffmommyab Usually one of the main goals of a long prison sentence is to undergo rehabilitation, but in the case of Abby Newman, 4 days in prison were enough to change her whole world. Newman, 28, of Alabama, believes her arrest helped her get her life back after her arrest photos went viral and attracted hundreds of thousands of new followers willing to pay for her provocative content. She says she was in debt before entering prison and 4 days later, when she got out, she earned $24,000 a week from fans who fell in love with her through her arrest photos. The tattooed porn star said that during her short stay in prison, she had no idea the photos had gone viral. She was jailed at different times for two separate charges of disorderly conduct and shoplifting. Her arrest photos were posted on the popular Instagram account Mugshawtys, which shares arrest photos of attractive women to its 680,000 followers. This helped Newman quickly become an internet star as thousands searched for her content on her not-so-updated OnlyFans page. When Newman got out of prison she discovered how many new followers she had gained and used the fame to produce content and make money from it. \"I appeared everywhere,\" she said in a conversation with the Daily Mail, \"I didn't know about it until I was released from prison and I saw that all my online platforms had followers added and I was tagged everywhere with my arrest photos. It turned out for the best, I guess.\" The arrest photos that made her a network star and saved her life: View this post on Instagram A post shared by mugshawtys (@mugshawtys).

So I got out of jail and was making $24,000 a week, just from customers who added My Snapchat, Twitter and OnlyFans.\" Abby said she went through a difficult time in her life during her arrests last year. \"I went through a lot at the time. I had an abortion and I wasn't myself. I was a complete mess. The truth is, going to prison didn't just help me financially. It also saved my life in a way. I'm recovering from heroin addiction. I've been sober for six years and after having an abortion I found myself on track Darkness of depression. I have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) and PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and I wasn't on my meds, so it wasn't me.\" More on the topic: Queen of Chaos: The most beautiful criminal in the world became a star because of the arrest photos The sexiest killer in the world, \"Kim Kardashian of the world of crime\", was found dead in a bed of love View this post on Instagram A post shared by Abbie Newman (@buffmommyab).

Newman's first arrest was in April of last year for fighting in public and a few months later she was arrested again for shoplifting on Thanksgiving. Abby added: \"Going viral helped me not only pay my debts and live a more comfortable life. It also helped me get back to myself. I feel blessed that it happened. Most people don't get a second chance and I'm probably on my 10th chance so far, so this is really It's a blessing how it all worked out. I was in jail over Thanksgiving and spent four days in jail total. I ended up getting probation for it. These weren't serious charges at all, which makes this whole thing even crazier.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Abbie Newman (@buffmommyab).

She said: \"I brought my mother-in-law to the program because she only found out that I was doing porn in an article published in the media, so it was a shock to my fiancé's family.\" Newman has since moved to Augusta, Georgia, with her daughter and her 22-year-old fiancé. She says she would love to increase her following on social media and hopes to appear more on the small screen. More on the same topic: detention onlyfans Network star porn",
