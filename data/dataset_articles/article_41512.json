  "text": "Bipartisan legislation would protect Americans from foreign threats and from warrantless government surveillance WASHINGTON – With the April 19 sunset of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) approaching in just a few weeks, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and U.S. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) today introduced the bipartisan Security and Freedom Enhancement (SAFE) Act, a compromise bill that protects Americans from foreign threats and from warrantless government surveillance. This legislation reflects a carefully crafted, pragmatic approach that protects national security by reauthorizing Section 702 of FISA and protects Americans’ privacy and civil liberties by enacting meaningful safeguards against warrantless surveillance and government abuses. Along with Durbin and Lee, the SAFE Act is cosponsored by Senators Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Steve Daines (R-MT), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ed Markey (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jon Tester (D-MT), and Peter Welch (D-VT). “There is little doubt that Section 702 is a valuable national security tool. However, while only foreigners overseas may be targeted, the program sweeps in massive amounts of Americans’ communications, which may be searched without a warrant. Even after implementing compliance measures, the FBI still conducted more than 200,000 warrantless searches of Americans’ communications in just one year—more than 500 warrantless searches per day,” said Durbin. “Our bipartisan legislation—the SAFE Act—is a sensible, bipartisan path forward on reauthorizing Section 702 with meaningful reforms.” “The documented abuses under FISA should provoke outrage from anyone who values the Fourth Amendment Rights of American citizens,” said Lee. “From warrantless searches targeting journalists, political commentators, and campaign donors to monitoring sitting members of Congress, these actions reveal a blatant disregard for individual liberties. Upholding the Fourth Amendment isn’t optional—it’s a duty. Our proposed reforms to FISA Section 702 are common sense and imperative to restoring trust in our government’s commitment to upholding Americans’ rights under the Constitution.” To ensure that FISA Section 702 and other surveillance authorities are used for appropriate purposes and in a manner that respects Americans’ privacy and civil liberties, the SAFE Act includes the following key safeguards and reforms: A short summary of the bill is available [here](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/SAFE%20Act%20Summary%203.7.2024.pdf). A section-by-section summary of the bill is available [here](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/SAFE%20Act%20of%202024%20Section%20by%20Section.pdf).
