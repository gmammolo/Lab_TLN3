  "text": "Sara’s art would live where Junji Ito’s twisted narratives meet Little Thunder’s delicate aesthetics. Her mesmerizing blend of the grotesque and the adorable draws viewers into a world where comfort and discomfort blur. Each digital artwork features dimensional views of her characters in a modern, anime-inspired style.\nMore: Instagram\nIllustrations’ palette combines kawaii culture and eroguro horror to create an enchanting world. Intestines, brains, blood, cute girls, shibari, and appendages create a gore story with unexpected cuteness. She gives her characters a glassy, fantastical appearance with great detail, texture, and shine, which contrasts with their soft, dreamy faces and enhances their surreal quality.\nHer characters, often tortured or murdered, seem innocent and almost painless. Body horror gets a pastel makeover, making viewers question their own suffering and pleasure.\n“Perfect Blue”, “Tokyo Gore Police”, and Hannibal Lecter inspire. Her work’s beauty and edginess, with an emphasis on expressive, vivid details, shows her characters’ expressiveness, creating a striking and thought-provoking aesthetic.",
