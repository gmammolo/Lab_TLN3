  "text": "Have you overcome breast cancer? If so, we have some valuable suggestions to enhance your quality of life post-treatment. The impact of breast cancer on your daily routine can vary based on its stage and the type of treatment being administered. Living with breast cancer is an unrelenting battle that can impact every aspect of a person's life. The physical toll of treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation, coupled with the emotional strain of facing mortality, can be overwhelming. “Women often struggle to maintain a sense of normalcy while dealing with the uncertainty and fear that come with a cancer diagnosis. One of the lesser-discussed challenges of living with breast cancer is the strain it puts on relationships. Family dynamics may shift as loved ones try to offer support while grappling with their fears and emotions,” said Dr Tejal Gorasia, Medical Director, Onco Life Cancer Center, Satara, adding, this can leave individuals feeling isolated when they need connection and understanding the most. Despite these immense challenges, many women find strength in their journey through breast cancer. Each woman's response to diagnosis and therapy is unique, with a range of support options available for those in need. Essential tips for women living with breast cancer Stay stress-free “One vital health tip for women [ living with breast cancer](https://www.onlymyhealth.com/risk-reducing-mastectomy-can-reduce-risk-of-breast-cancer-1708665402) is to prioritise self-care and mental well-being.
