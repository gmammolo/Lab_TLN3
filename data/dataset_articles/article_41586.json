  "text": "At Whitehall High School, you can still see Saquon Barkley's jersey commemorated on the football field, and you'll find signatures and pictures of Barkley in Athletic Director Bob Hartman's office. He said Barkley is a role model for students there. \"It's really easy to root for him as a person as much as a football player, because he says and does the right things,\" said Hartman. Amazingly, Hartman said it wasn't immediately apparent back then that Barkley was going to be an offensive superstar. \"His sophomore year, he didn't play a ton of varsity snaps on the offensive side of the ball. He played a little more defensively, then flourished after that. His junior year was really good, of course his senior year he was player of the year in Pennsylvania,\" said Hartman. Hartman said Barkley still comes back to run camps for aspiring athletes. \"It's a youth camp for kids in the Lehigh Valley. It was a great success last year. He was there running around with the kids,\" said Hartman. And while Barkley is celebrating his new role on the Eagles, he has another award awaiting him at Whitehall. \"He was here at the end of January for Hall of Fame night. One of his very good friends was inducted, and he'll get inducted here in short order. It's 10 years from graduation, so he's right around that number right now,\" said Hartman. But it's not just people in the Lehigh Valley excited to see Barkley in Eagles green. \"He's a local kid, and it feels like he's coming back home,\" said Jeff Warren, host of the Philadelphia Sports Table podcast. Warren said you should prepare to see a lot more fans wearing Barkley's name. \"You're going to see a lot of Saquon Barkley jerseys. If he does wear number 26, we're going to be seeing a lot of those jerseys,\" said Warren. Hartman said he just hopes Barkley's move to Philly will bring him around the Whitehall High School field a little more often. \"If he can be around here just a little bit more, that's even better for our kids and our community, because he's such a good person,\" said Hartman. In his career as a Whitehall Zephyr, Barkley scored 63 touchdowns. Hartman said he hopes to see Barkley back on the field this summer teaching kids to do the same thing.",
