  "text": "TikTok secured a legal victory in Canada on Wednesday after the country's federal court overturned a government order for the company to shut down its Canadian operations. The ruling directs the Canadian government to reconsider the case and allows the short-video platform to continue serving the 14 million plus users in the country.\nIn a short judgment, Canadian federal court judge Russel Zinn set aside the order and sent the matter ⁠back to Industry Minister Melanie Joly for review without giving any reasons.\nA TikTok spokesperson said the company welcomed the decision to set aside the shutdown order, noting that the platform looks forward to working with the minister toward a resolution that is in the best interests of users.\n\"Keeping TikTok's Canadian team in place will enable a path forward that continues to support millions of dollars of investment in Canada and hundreds of local jobs,\" the spokesperson said.\nWednesday's ruling follows a decision by Canada's industry ministry in November 2024, which ordered the platform to wind down its business in the country on national security grounds. TikTok subsequently filed an appeal.",
