  "text": "[An aspiring journalist who died in a road traffic incident in Limerick](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41250796.html) is being celebrated with a new competition being launched in his memory. Joe Drennan from Mountrath, Co Laois died in October 2023 and the new memorial competition will recognise journalism that contributes to the understanding of marginalised communities. Mr Drennan had been editor in chief of UL student newspaper and website, Limerick Voice, a few weeks earlier and had \"urged reporters to find a voice that they themselves had not heard before\". UL associate professor Kathryn Hayes said the competition was designed to honour Mr Drennan’s “pioneering spirit” and the impact he made during his time in UL. “We believe this competition will help contribute to a more inclusive and diverse media landscape and is a fitting tribute to Joe,” she said. Mr Drennan’s mother Marguerite said the competition is a “fitting way” to remember her son’s passion for journalism and inclusivity in his writing. The winning article will be published in. Mark Hennessy, Ireland and Britain Editor ofsaid: \"As journalists, it's not only our duty to report the news, but to illuminate the stories often overlooked, amplify the voices of the marginalised and strive for a more inclusive narrative. “The Joe Drennan Memorial Competition serves not only as a tribute to the life of a young journalist whose passion for social justice was cut short, but also as a beacon for more inclusive journalism. The competition will run annually commencing from the 2024/25 academic year and the winner will receive a perpetual trophy presented by the Drennan family. The deadline for submissions is November 30, 2024.",
