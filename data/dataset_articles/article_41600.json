It's the first time a locally-made fish sauce is used at a luxury resort. Photo courtesy of Doãn Văn Tuấn\nGeneral director of Indochina beach hotel joint-stock company Trần Đức Quỳnh said the fish sauce brand ‘Hương Làng Cổ’ (Ancient Village Savour) was qualified for official use by the executive chef of the resort at cuisine events in early March.\nHe said the authentic sauce helps create a unique and unforgettable cultural experience for international and Vietnamese travellers in Đà Nẵng.\nNguyễn Thái Nhật Huy, marketing and sales representative of the fish sauce brand, said the family would reserve 600 litres of the two-year-old fermented fish sauce for Furama’s kitchen use in 2024.\nHuy said all premium fish sauce would be stored in oak barrels for the best taste and flavour.\nExecutive chef at Furama, Doãn Văn Tuấn, said he emphasised using traditional local ingredients and materials in his course on Việt Nam’s cuisine art.\n“The ‘Ancient Village Savour’ fish sauce brand features the unique taste of fishing communities in Đà Nẵng. The mixture of qualified fish sauce and other ingredients in cooking would bring memorable satisfaction for gastronomes visiting Đà Nẵng,” Tuấn said.\nHe also said Nam Ô village fish sauce bottles can serve as gifts for visitors.\nBùi Văn Phú, an owner of ‘Ancient Village Savour’ family, said the premium fish sauce, which has preserved the 1958 seal of quality, has not yet been officially exported, but it has been used by overseas Vietnamese in the US, Australia and Europe.\nPhú said his family alone produces 20,000 litres per year, out of a total 200,000 litres capacity among more than 100 households in the village.\nThe fish sauce brand is currently sold at the Go supermarket under the Central Retail Corporation in downtown Đà Nẵng, making it the first made-in-Đà Nẵng fish sauce on sale at a supermarket.\nThe fish sauce trade of Nam Ô Village was also recognised as a National Intangible Heritage by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism in 2019, and the village has become an eco-tour and craft destination.\nLast year, the fish sauce brand was the only representative product of the central city participating in Foodex-Japan 2023, the largest international food and beverage exhibition in Asia.\nRecently, Nam Ô fish sauce coffee, a coffee topped with concentrated dried fish sauce powder, was introduced as an innovative and diversified marketing toolat local fairs and craft tours in the village.
