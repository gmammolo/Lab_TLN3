I understand that you may feel like no one has ever gone through this but you, but trust me, YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

Authors MrE 1 7 Welcome to another one of my things. What is going on/ Why are you here? 2 7 If your answer was depression/anxiety/@bu$e/@$$ult/r@pe/PTSD, (etc.) What was the cause/What made you feel this way? Explain what is going on (Just know, that if you don't want me to read your answers I won't. This is for you.) 3 7 Has this affected your focus in work/school? If so, how? 4 7 How long has it been since this happened? Is it still going on? 5 7 Does this affect the way you perform? Do you flinch when others seem like they may touch you? Do you have anxiety attacks when you get reminded of your past or what is going on right now? Do you feel sad, depressed or anxious all the time? 6 7 Has this lead you to think about/do self harm, have $u!c!del thoughts, or withdraw from people? 7 7 If you need to talk directly to me about this, I may be able to help. I'm not a professional therapist, but I can relate. Just message me,and I will get back to you fast as I can. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better? I have a group: Vent, therapy, and help. This is where I will help you. I will be there for you. Show all « » Share answers with author Log in to add to the discussion Log in or sign up",
