  "text": "TAMPA, Fla.- March 15 is known as “National Shoe the World Day”, a day that sheds light on the importance of footwear and the need for quality footwear for millions of people worldwide who can’t afford or don’t have access to it. This year, the Tampa Police Department is proud to announce the launch of our own \"Heart and Sole\" Shoe Drive, beginning on Friday, March 15, 2024. This initiative aims to collect new or gently-used sneakers and shoes for children in need throughout our community. Having a good pair of shoes is essential for a child's well-being. It allows them to participate in activities, play safely, and feel confident. The brainchild of Sergeant Roni Hill, this project is another example of Tampa Police officers working to make a positive impact on the community they serve. \"This shoe drive is a great example of officers going above and beyond to support our community's youth,\" said Chief Lee Bercaw. \"Sergeant Hill's proactive approach will ensure that children in need have the footwear they deserve. By ensuring children have proper footwear, we're helping them stay healthy and active. It is these kinds of initiatives that strengthen our bonds with the community we protect and serve.\" Community members can also \"lace up” and help stock this shoe closet by dropping off new or gently-used sneakers and shoes at any Tampa Police District Office or Headquarters. Together, we can ensure that every child in Tampa can walk with confidence.",
