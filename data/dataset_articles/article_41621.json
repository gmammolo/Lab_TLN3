  "text": "[‘Love is Blind’ season 6 has had viewers glued to their screens and pouring out all sorts of emotion.](https://thatgrapejuice.net/entertainment/2024/03/love-is-blind-star-clay-gravesande-addresses-dramatic-aftermath-of-season-6-with-amber-desiree-ad-smith/clay-ad-love-is-blind-tamron-tgj/) The relationship arc between castmates Clay Gravesande and Amber Desirée “AD” Smith, for many, has proven to be the nucleus of the season. Especially in the wake of the dramatic finale. As watched by millions, Gravesande opted not to say “I Do” to Smith in what presented as a super last-minute decision.

Full story below… Accompanied by his mother, Gravesande declared that Smith is the “love of my life,” but ultimately pointed to the familial traumas around infidelity as making him doubt his readiness to be a husband. During the candid chat, he revealed that he is now in therapy and offered an update on the status of his relationship with Smith in the here and now. Watch the full segment:",
