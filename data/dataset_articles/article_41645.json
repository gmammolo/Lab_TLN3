  "text": "Elton John and David Furnish Are the Definition of a Power Couple! Meet the Singer’s Loving Husband\nWith countless romantic No. 1 hits,\nElton John definitely draws musical inspiration from his own marriage to husband David Furnish. The pair were smitten with each other from the moment they met in 1993. In 2005, they were declared civil partners, and later got married at their Windsor home in 2014. Now, they have a beautiful family together.\nWho Is Elton John’s Husband David Furnish?\nDavid, born in Canada in 1962, was working as an advertising executive at Ogilvy & Mather when he met Elton at a dinner party. The “Tiny Dancer” singer was previously married to Renate Blauel from 1984 to 1988. He knew David was The One right off the bat.\n“I was attracted to David immediately,” the Grammy winner told\nParade in February 2010. “He had a real job, his own apartment, a car. He was independent. I didn’t need to take care of him. I thought, ‘God, this is new territory for me — someone wants to be with me just because he likes me.’ I knew he was the one because he is not afraid of me. He always tells me exactly what he thinks.”\nShortly after meeting his future husband, David decided to embark on a new career path under Elton’s entertainment label. He always had a passion for filmmaking and directed Elton’s 1997 documentary Elton John: Tantrums & Tiaras. The Rocket Pictures cochief produced many other films with the label including It’s a Boy Girl Thing, Women Talking Dirty and Gnomeo & Juliet. In 2019, David produced his husband’s Oscar-winning biopic, Rocketman.\nIn addition to conquering the world of movies, the film maverick went on to produce Billy Elliott: The Musical, which became an instant Broadway hit. Elton, who worked on the music for the theater production, serves with David on the board of the Elton John AIDS Foundation. The charity aims to support organizations that provide treatment and resources for those affected by HIV around the globe.\nDoes Elton John Have Kids?\nThe power couple became dads when they welcomed\ntheir first child together, son Zachary, via surrogate in 2010. They welcomed their second son, Elijah, also via surrogate in 2013. Both David and Elton have adjusted to becoming full-time working fathers. David has regularly contributed to both Tatler and GQ magazines and was named one of GQ’s 50 best-dressed men in Britain in 2015. Despite being married to one of the most successful musicians in the entire world, he has continued to lead a tremendous career of his own.\n“It’s very important in any relationship that one partner doesn’t lose themselves in the other, and that’s very easy if you’re involved with a celebrity,” the father of two told\nThe Guardian in September 2001. “They get so much attention and so much deference anyway, it would be very easy to just get swept up into being their other half. But the person that Elton fell in love with – well, I had my own career, my own identity. The worst thing I could do was sacrifice that.”\nElton John and David Furnish Are Collaborators\nIn March 2024, Elton revealed that the pair were staying busy while working together on some new projects. “There’s a lot going on this year, but nothing we can’t handle,” he told\nExtra at the time.\n“We’re doing lots of creative things — musicals and stuff like that. I still have my finger on the pulse, running around. We’re spending more time with our kids,” he said, adding that he loved working with his hubby on the projects.\n“I do like writing them because it’s a collaboration with a lot of people,” Elton explained of the two musicals he has in the works with David. “It takes a long time to [bring] to the stage.”",
