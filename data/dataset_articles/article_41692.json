  "text": "Morongo Tribe writes $5 million check to help San Gorgonio hospital The Morongo Band of Mission Indians today donated $5 million to San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital in Banning to establish a program geared specifically to women's health. \"Morongo is delighted to be building on our partnership with the San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital Foundation to advance health care in the Pass,'' Morongo Tribal Chairman Charles Martin said. \"It is crucial that we continue to support new advancements at our community hospital to ensure women, mothers and families have access to high-quality care that addresses their unique health care needs.\" The $5 million check is the second-largest single charitable gift to the foundation, following a $5.6 million check provided by the tribe in 2022, according to officials. \"Today's gift by ... Morongo will bring profound and positive changes to local health care, allowing us to expand our services and improve the wellbeing of women of all ages in our community,'' Dr. Karan Singh said. \"Morongo is helping us set a new standard for health care excellence across the San Gorgonio Pass.'' The funds will go directly to the establishment of a \"Women's Health Program,'' providing specialized services, like obstetrics, gynecology, breast exams, family planning and general wellness efforts, according to officials. \"The donation will also upgrade critical patient monitoring systems, with $1.4 million dedicated to enhancing technological capabilities and patient care efficiency,'' Morongo said in a statement. Hospital Board Chairwoman Susan DiBiasi expressed the medical campus' gratitude to the tribe for the \"incredible support you continue to offer to our foundation and our hospital.\" \"This donation will improve the lives of women and children across the Pass communities and puts our hospital in a position to provide innovative new health care services to our patients,'' she said. According to the tribe, with the latest gift, the total amount of charitable donations made by Morongo exceeds $20 million over the past decade in support of \"local and regional nonprofit organizations that help seniors, families, veterans, youth and those in need.\"",
