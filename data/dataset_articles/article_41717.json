  "text": "We've partnered with our friends at the Dane County Humane Society and Shelter from the Storm to bring you a monthly list of extremely adoptable pets. Some of these sweethearts have been waiting a while for their new homes, but they're all eager to show you their unique personalities. Carlotta | F | Age: Adult After spending time as a street dog, Carlotta's in search of the good life — we’re talking treats, pets, toys, you name it! This American Pit Bull and Terrier mix isn’t quick to trust another dog (street life, remember?) but with some patience and a little guidance, she comes around. For maximum pampering, she’s looking for a home without children or other pets. Kroaker ) | F | Age: Senior Kroaker is shy, but her name suggests she has a voice and likes to use it. This sweet, senior gal would like to be a permanent fixture in the sunniest spot in your home where she can R&R for the rest of her days. Move the cactus out of the sun, and replace it with Kroaker — plus, she’s much softer. Bullwinkle | M | 4 years Bullwinkle is looking to be the one and only pup in your heart. He’s a gentle giant, but he’s so relaxed and great on the leash. This mastiff / cane corso mix will definitely make you melt if you stare into his eyes for too long. Frigg | F | Age: 2 years Frigg (or Frigga) has a clandestine spirit. She loves to snoop from high vantage points, and won’t hesitate to poke around at things that are mysterious to her. Frigg would love nothing more than to have another cat pal to investigate with. Archer | M | Age: Adult Archer is one zoomie, happy boy. He has all kinds of husky (mix) energy and would love to help you clean those dog treats out of your pantry. Archer is quickly learning how to be a good dog on the leash, but he’s probably too playful for cats, critters, small dogs and young children. Another playful dog would be his ideal best friend. Archer’s adoption fee is waived, and he’s sponsored for a free scholarship to virtual training program GoodPup. Rocket | M | Age: Adult Rocket is Archer’s kindred spirit. This spunky Alaskan Husky prefers to play with the big dogs (he’ll do better in a home without cats, critters, small dogs or young children), but he’d like some alone time with you when he leaves the shelter before reuniting with dog pals. Perhaps, you can bond by gazing into his icy blue eyes. Rocket comes with a free scholarship to virtual training program GoodPup. Coors | M | Age: Adult This guy’s got a goofy smile to match his zenned-out personality. Coors is all about the scritches and hanging out with human friends. Other dogs tend to harsh his chill vibe, so he’d prefer to be your only pup. Coors comes with a free scholarship to virtual training program GoodPup. Obi | M | Age: 1 year [Insert Star Wars pun.] Obi the tuxedo cat will win you over with Jedi mind tricks (and his lovey demeanor). Just like all Jedis though, he can be fiercely independent at times and would like a caretaker that respects his ways. Is the force working on you? Ava | F | Age: 13 years At 13 years old, Ava has already seen the world and she’s ready to settle down in front of some birdie videos on the computer. Ava has lots of love to share, and wants to spend it all on you! Did we mention her adoption fee is fully sponsored? Junior | M | Age: 1 year Junior’s foster family says he “would make a great adventure/camping/running partner.” Does that sound like you? He’s an energetic, young shepherd mix who’s easy on the leash, a good trainee and great with other dogs. In fact, he’s hoping you have other dogs (just not small children) to befriend. Crinkle Fry | F | Age: 1 year Crinkle Fry is a small Siamese kitty with pretty blue eyes. She’s just as sweet, and maybe a bit shy, as she sounds, but she has a soft spot for other cats. If you pamper and snuggle her, she’ll definitely ask for belly rubs and pets. COPYRIGHT 2024 BY MADISON MAGAZINE. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
