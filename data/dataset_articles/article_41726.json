  "text": "[Human Events Daily](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/human-events-daily-with-jack-posobiec/id1585243541?i=1000649237738), Jack Posobiec pointed out that Donald Trump's court cases are falling apart because he has \"favor,\" as exemplified by the Fox News poll out of Pennsylvania, a key swing state coming into the 2024 presidential election. He highlighted a key result: that 12 percent more Gen X voters would vote for Trump in the state if the election were today, something that Posobiec dubbed \"The Gen X factor.\" He began by pointing out that Trump's court cases \"have become noise.\" It is not luck behind the dismantling of the court cases, he said, but because of \"the people he's facing in all of these cases, and the people behind the machinations that give us these cases are scum\" in addition to \"something called favor.\" \"So now it's time to cut through the noise,\" he said. Now it's time to cut through all the nonsense that's out there and focus on the signal. What matters most is winning the Rust Belt, winning Arizona and winning Georgia. When I see that Trump is now winning Gen X voters in Pennsylvania by 12 points, that shows me not just a path forward, that shows me the absolute highway to absolute victory.\" He continued: \"These are the shifts. You can't just look at these things as snapshots you have to look at the shifting demographics, the shifting poll numbers and understand the Gen X awakening is something that we've been talking about here on this program on Human Events for a long time.\" Watch the full episode below.",
