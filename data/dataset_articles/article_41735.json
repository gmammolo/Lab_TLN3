  "text": "The mystery is solved. Since Shohei Ohtani announced his marriage at the end of February, his fans have had one burning question: Who is his wife? Now we have an answer: Mamiko Tanaka, a Japanese basketball player. Ohtani posted a photo of himself on his Instagram story with Tanaka outside the Dodgers' plane ahead of the team's trip to South Korea for MLB Opening Day. Yoshinobu Yamamoto and the team's two Japanese translators were in photo as well. Ohtani captioned the Instagram story in Korean, writing \"Can't Wait\" with a South Korean flag emoji. The Dodgers also posted a photo Ohtani and Tanaka on X, formerly Twitter, with this caption: \"Wheels up to Seoul.\" Wheels up to Seoul.— Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) [pic.twitter.com/NgeQYiwgS2] [March 14, 2024] This marks the first time Ohtani and Tanaka have been seen together publicly. Here's what to know about the Japanese basketball star. Who is Shohei Ohtani's wife? Tanaka is a 27-year-old basketball player. She played for Waseeda University and the Fujitsu Red Wave of the Women's Japan Basketball League. She began playing for the Red Wave in 2019, and she ended her tenure in 2023. She did not suit up for the 2023-24 WJBL season. The 5-11 post player averaged 7.8 points and 6.0 rebounds in 24 minutes per game during the 2022-23 season. She scored her 2022-23 season-high 24 points against the Himeji Egrets. When first announcing his marriage, Ohtani didn't reveal Tanaka's identity. He simply told reporters that his wife was a \" normal Japanese woman .\" Mamiko Tanaka: a normal Japanese woman— Shawn Spradling (@Shawn_Spradling) [pic.twitter.com/RwnvXFNDGl] [March 14, 2024] Tanaka was WNBA Draft eligible in 2018 after finishing college but was not drafted and opted to play in Japan. She played on Japan's FIBA Asia U18 and U16 Championship teams and on the FIBA U17 World Championship team . Los Angeles Dodgers schedule The Dodgers begin the MLB season about a week before anyone else with a special Opening Day in Seoul, South Korea, against the San Diego Padres.
