  "text": "Blake backs cops\nCommissioner of Police Dr Kevin Blake has reaffirmed his unwavering support for members of the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) who operate lawfully and professionally on the frontline, amid ongoing public scrutiny of police actions.\n\"You are not alone, you are not unappreciated, and you are not unsupported,\" Blake said.\nThe commissioner was addressing members of the JCF in the most recent edition of Force Orders, where he pushed back against public commentary surrounding fatal police shootings.\nHe rejected allegations of widespread unlawful killings by police officers, describing such claims as particularly troubling in light of the existence of an independent oversight body with full authority to investigate police conduct.\n\"The illogic to believe that we are going around, risking our lives, reputation, families and freedom to carry out wanton killings ... is disheartening,\" the commissioner said.\nBlake also urged civil society groups, advocacy organisations and public commentators to redirect their efforts towards discouraging armed criminals from confronting law enforcement officers.\n\"Our time would be better spent if these persons, groups and organisations join our voices in appealing to the murderous thugs to not raise their weapons against the police when we have to confront them,\" he said.\nTurning his attention to the men and women under his command, Blake encouraged officers to remain focused and confident, despite the criticism they may face.\n\"Remain calm in the noise and confident that your leadership will always stand with you once you act within the law and in the interest of protecting life and society,\" he said.\nHe added that, ultimately, officers would be judged by their conduct and outcomes, \"not by the loudest voices, but by your integrity, your restraint, and your results\".",
