  "text": "CLEARFIELD — Lawrence Township Supervisors praised the four Clearfield Regional Police Department officers who are credited for rescuing six people from a fire recently in Clearfield Borough during its meeting Tuesday night.\nOn Jan. 9, at 12:40 a.m. Sgt. Jonathan Walker and Officer Dylan Kahley arrived on the scene at the residence located in the 500-block of E. 7th Street for a report of a structure fire.\nThey found the attic well-involved with fire. Inside there were three adults and three children — police were able to evacuate everyone from the residence safely prior to the fire department arriving.\nOfficer Anthony Lash then arrived on scene and assisted in removing family pets from the residence and Officer Shawn Fye also arrived and assisted on scene, according to a previous article.\n“I would like to recognize Sgt. Walker, Officer Kahley, Officer Fye and Officer Lash for their heroic actions a week and a half ago,” Chairman Randy Powell said. “I appreciate all of the police officers and I really appreciate everything those four officers did.”\nSupervisor Jeremy Ruffner agreed.\n“It’s unfortunate when people lose property and a house burns down,” Ruffner said. “But the one thing we can’t replace is a life.”\nSupervisor Scott Way echoed their statements.\n“I like to thank those officers and the other officers for everything that they do in this community,” Way said. “We would be lost without them.”\nRuffner said this incident shows why it was important for the township to participate in a lawsuit against Clearfield Borough to preserve the regional police department.\n“Those guys, without a doubt, this is my 25-plus years of experience in the fire service, saved lives that morning,” Ruffner added. “This is why having a municipal police service is so important and this is the reason what we are doing what we are doing.”\nRuffner added, “You can slice it anyway you want to slice it, but when it comes down to it, it is invaluable. It is absolutely the best thing you can spend your money on — is having that public safety.”",
