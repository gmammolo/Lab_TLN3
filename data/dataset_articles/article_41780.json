  "text": "“Chinese Drama Competition Celebrates Culture Through Culinary Themes”\nThe 2nd Chinese Drama Competition, sponsored by Nuxi Chinese Culture Studio (NECCS), took place on March 9 at the Boston Overseas Chinese Education Center. Hosted as part of a series of traditional Chinese character activities, the event saw participants showcasing their talents in the world of drama and performance.\nWith the theme of “Food Taste” for the senior group, siblings Lin Yuelun and Lin Zhuowei from Lexington Chinese School captivated the audience with their culinary-inspired performance. The middle grade group, themed “Mom and Dad Love to Cook,” featured students from Boston Tzu Chi Humanities School and China Guangjiao School bringing their own twists to the stage.\nVolunteers from Pushi Chinese Culture Studio added a unique touch to the competition by taking photos with contestants holding kitchen props. Pushi President Feng Wenluan praised the integration of spoken Chinese and cultural experience into the performances, highlighting the practical learning opportunities provided by the event.\nThe competition also featured insightful feedback from Judge Professor Gao Xinyi, who encouraged participants to engage with the audience both on and off stage. As the contestants navigated the challenges of dramatic performance, they received valuable advice on maintaining clarity and composure during their acts.\nFollowing the competition, a relaxed discussion allowed students and parents to share their experiences and offer suggestions for future events. Parents noted the valuable connections forged during the preparation process, emphasizing the positive impact on family dynamics and cultural exchanges.\nIn an effort to enhance performance skills, Pushi culture teachers Li Yuying and Lu Yongyi demonstrated collaborative techniques and encouraged experiential learning. By engaging in activities related to the performance theme, such as cooking with parents, students were able to refine their skills and deepen their understanding of traditional Chinese culture.\nAs the curtain closed on the 2nd Chinese Drama Competition, participants left with a renewed appreciation for the intersection of language, culture, and performance art. With plans for future competitions and continued cultural exchange, the event served as a testament to the vibrant tradition of Chinese drama in the community.\nEditor in charge: Feng Wenluan",
