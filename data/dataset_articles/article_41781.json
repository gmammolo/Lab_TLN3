  "text": "Talk about a historic clip!\nOver 35 years ago back in 1988, Donald Trump went on Oprah’s TV show and they had an incredible chat.\nYou can see Oprah fawning all over Donald….\nThey all LOVED him before he ran for President!\nAnd speaking of running for President, Oprah asked him if he ever thought he’d run.\nListen as he tells Oprah he has no desire to run for President because it’s a tough life, but then he says he would never close the door on it in case things got so bad in America that he had to.\nWhat a wise man…\nHe kept the door open because he could see even back then the direction America was going.\nWatch here:\nDonald Trump talks America First with\n[@Oprah]— back in 1988. [pic.twitter.com/CV2Uydm6ru]\n— News Nomad (@The_Nomad_News)\n[March 10, 2024]\nBackup here:\nOver 35 years ago, Donald Trump tells Oprah exactly what he would do if things got bad enough…\n[@DailyNoahNews] [pic.twitter.com/ohP9NvwfkX]\n— DailyNoah.com (@DailyNoahNews)\n[March 13, 2024]\nWhat really strikes me is how stunningly CONSISTENT he is.\nHe sounds the same in 1980 as he does in 1988 as he does today!\nSame guy!\nAnd it’s not the person the Legacy Media wants to tell you he is.\nThis is man who loves America.\nBut that’s not all.\nLet’s go back even earlier….\nThe Oprah clip was 1988.\nLet’s go back to 1980 where we have Donald Trump at Age 34.\nEven back then his love for this country rose above all else.\nIt’s all there.\nWatch here:\nSet aside what you think of Trump for a second and listen to this clip.\n— Farzad (@farzyness)\n[March 13, 2024]\nBackup here if needed:\nDonald Trump asked at Age 34 if he would like to be President one day…\nHis answer may surprise you.\n[@DailyNoahNews] [pic.twitter.com/cL8g7bWP6G]\n— DailyNoah.com (@DailyNoahNews)\n[March 13, 2024]\nEven Elon Musk weighed in by saying “Interesting”:\nInteresting\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)\n[March 13, 2024]\nYes indeed, very interesting!\nOk, now a few more since we’re doing this big walk down Memory Lane….\nRARE VIDEO: David Letterman LOVED Donald Trump!\nYou’re going to love this.\nSo I have to admit something…\nI was a huge David Letterman fan.\nAlways thought he was hilarious.\nGenuinely funny and I loved how he would interview and joke with guests.\nIf Leno was your polished, plain vanilla comedy, Letterman had all the jagged edges….and the edges were hilarious.\nBut then something happened.\nAs he got older, he got more political and started going far left.\nAnd with that move the comedy started to disappear.\nBecause comedy can’t exist when you’re too full of anger and political ideology.\nSo I want to you try and forget about the David Letterman of today and I want to take you back to the David Letterman of the 1980s.\nWhen Letterman was in his prime….and when David Letterman LOVED Donald Trump.\nThose are not my words, that comes straight from Letterman himself in this clip.\nWatch and enjoy:\nCLASSIC: Dave Letterman Asks Donald Trump To Build Him A New Office\n[pic.twitter.com/MbMjTZbDeM]\n— DailyNoah.com (@DailyNoahNews)\n[May 20, 2023]\nBackup here on\nRumble:\nHere are a couple more…\nWatch this one from 1992:\nAnd one of the earliest ones in 1986:\n ",
