  "text": "Caoimhin Kelleher’s recent prominence between the posts for Liverpool has caught the attentions of Irish football fans and one Reds legend has become the latest to praise the Corkman’s performances.\nKelleher has started the last eight games on the spin in the absence of Alisson Becker, with the Brazilian suffering a flare-up with a hamstring injury that had ruled him out of three games earlier in the campaign.\nToday's top videos STORY CONTINUES BELOW The 25-year-old’s performance in Liverpool’s Carabao Cup final win over Chelsea was roundly praised and followed by clean sheets in FA Cup and Premier League action against Southampton and Nottingham Forest respectively.\nVirgil van Dijk and Caoimhin Kelleher of Liverpool celebrate after the team’s victory in the Carabao Cup Final. Pic: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images Former Liverpool and Ireland midfielder Ray Houghton added to the praise and spoke of the “staggering saves” made by the ‘keeper along the way.\nHe told Newbettingoffers.co.uk : ‘In his last few matches, any doubts that people may have had about Caoimhin have gone now.\n‘He’s made some unbelievable saves, some staggering saves. The one in the League Cup final was absolutely out of this world.’\nLiverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker has missed the last eight games through injury. Pic:Marc Atkins/Getty Images ‘All of those doubts about how he commands his box or his shot stopping, they have all gone now.\n‘If Alisson is out for Liverpool, there is zero worried talk from Reds fans about Kelleher – everyone is happy with what they have seen.’\nHoughton also pointed to the markedly high defensive line and its retention with Kelleher as a sign of the overall confidence of Jurgen Klopp’s team in his abilities.\nCaoimhin Kelleher in action for Liverpool against Southampton in the FA Cup. Pic: Alex Livesey – Danehouse/Getty Images ‘His performances of late have been so assured,’ he continued. ‘If a team are unsure about their keeper, you’ll see them drop off really deep to protect him, and stay close to the keeper.\n‘If you watch recent Liverpool games, that back four are right up the pitch.\nUEFA eyeing Croke Park as Europa League final fan zone as crowd concerns grow ‘They’d be in exactly the same position with Alisson as they are with Kelleher. That shows you the confidence that they have in him.’",
