  "text": "It was a golden day for Hatboro-Horsham’s Annie Jia Wednesday at the PIAA Class 3A Swimming Championships, the junior winning both the 200 individual medley and 100 butterfly — setting a PIAA record in the later — and helping the Hatters win in the 200 free relay. North Penn’s Maddie Faikish also claimed gold in the 200 free at Bucknell University’s Kinney Natatorium while the Upper Dublin took first place in the girls 200 medley relay.

Hofmann, a junior, swam a 1:49:87 in the 200 IM, an effort only bettered by Conestoga’s Jake Wang, who won with a NFHS Honor Roll time of 1:44.20.
