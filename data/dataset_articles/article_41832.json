  "text": "By Jerry Herrmann ,\n2 hours ago\nClackamas County is blessed with five commissioners who effectively work together to get things done and a county administrator who brings the process forward in an effective and orderly way.\nCitizens of Oregon seem to have been hoodwinked by statewide Measure 110 that was fostered to reduce drug and addiction problems but ultimately is causing the greatest die-off of affected people in the state’s history. Our Clackamas County Commission supported and advocated for major change in this measure that it should truly “measure up” to its purposes. County Board Chair Tootie Smith led that campaign with her fellow commissioners. Her commission ultimately influenced many other counties of Oregon and our recent legislative process.\nIt’s truly amazing to watch County Administrator Gary Schmidt at work, bringing forth the legislative and business matters the county must respond to. His leadership in government affairs in his recent past is the reason he is so good at working with citizens and commissioners so they can act effectively.\nFor all these things, we should be proud of our Clackamas County commissioners, Schmidt and their staff who make a difference for Clackamas County and our region, no matter which party they subscribe to. They have wrestled through things that are very difficult and then come together. Their efforts set an example for what our nation could do despite party affiliations that really gets the job done for our county and our nation.\nJerry Herrmann is a Clackamas County resident who serves as board president of Rivers of Life, a nonprofit organization that works with at-risk youth to encourage tourism and environmental cleanups in the Willamette Valley.",
