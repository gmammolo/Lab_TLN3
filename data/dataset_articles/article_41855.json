  "text": "Check out these pets along with a ton of other amazing pets from Marine Humane who deserve a great forever home! Get more information here!\nMeet Hennessy: Meet Hennessy, a charming adult canine with a heart full of love and a mind eager to learn. Despite his shy nature, Hennessy's playful spirit shines through, bringing joy to everyone around him. He's not just all fun and games, though; Hennessy is incredibly smart, picking up new tricks and commands with ease. One thing to note about Hennessy is his strength, especially when he's excited to go on walks. He's a strong puller, and while his leash skills could use some refining, with a little patience and positive reinforcement, he's bound to master it. Hennessy is a sweet, intelligent, and playful companion who's looking for a home where he can continue to grow, learn, and love. Adopting Hennessy means gaining a loyal friend who will bring endless joy and companionship to your life.\n***ADOPTION FEE PAID***\nMeet Benji: Benji is a 100-pound bundle of curiosity and goofiness. Despite his size, Benji is gentle and loves exploring new environments. He's got a knack for sniffing out hidden treasures, whether it's a misplaced toy or a tasty treat. His goofy nature means there's never a dull moment around him. However, Benji needs careful introductions to other dogs. His size can be intimidating, but with patience and proper introductions, he can befriend other dogs. Adopting Benji means bringing home a loyal companion who will fill your life with laughter and joy.\n***ADOPTION FEE PAID***\nMeet Uriel: Uriel is an all-around nice guy! He might be a bit shy at first, but give him a chance and he'll show you how sweet, charming, and playful he is. He's a bit of a talker makes awesome biscuits in his bed and loves patches of sunshine. As an indoor/outdoor guy in his previous home, he may want to continue having the best of the indoor/outdoor worlds in his new home. This cool cat loves to hang out with people, but he also had feline buddies in his last home and sometimes just likes to do his own thing. Ready for a handsome, charming new family member with extra toes? (Yes, he is a polydactyl!) Uriel might be your guy!\nMeet Pumpkin & Pie: Hello, we're Pumpkin and Pie, two friendly guinea pigs with a sweet nature. We're adults, but our curiosity makes every day a new adventure. We love exploring our surroundings, sniffing out treats, and meeting new people. We're gentle souls who enjoy the quiet moments too, cuddling up together after a day of play. We're a package deal, you see, because we can't imagine life without each other. We're looking for a forever home where we can continue to share our love and companionship. Why adopt us? Well, we promise to bring joy, warmth, and a touch of mischief into your life. We're not just pets, we're a pair of friends waiting to become part of your family.\nPlus - for the whole month of March, adoption fees are waived for all guinea pigs to celebrate Adopt a Rescued Guinea Pig Month!",
