  "text": "In a twist that reads like a script out of a Hollywood movie, a man from Fairfield initially shrugged off calls from lotto officials, suspecting nothing more than the usual telemarketing spiel. However, when the Sydney man finally picked up the phone this evening, he was met with the staggering revelation that he was the sole winner of Powerball jackpot, pocketing an entire $40 million from draw 1452 on Thursday, 14 March 2024. “How do I know this is for real?” he queried, a mix of disbelief and caution in his voice while checking his winning online ticket. “Thank you! That’s a big prize! “I’ll be able to pay off the house, that’s for sure. “There’s plenty of people that need help that I know of. That’s the first thing I’ll be doing. “Otherwise, we’ll just have to see what happens and let it sink in. To be honest, I’m speechless, I don’t know what to say!” The newly minted multi-millionaire shared he’d temporarily forgotten he even had an entry into tonight’s draw as he had an online subscription that automatically secured him an entry every time the Powerball jackpot soared above $20 million. “I’m a regular player. I’ve got a subscription. Out of the blue – I usually don’t really know when it happens – I get a ticket into anything over $20 million,” he said. “I didn’t even know I had a ticket into tonight’s draw until you called! “I had a headache before, but now I’m not even thinking about that. “I hope you keep putting a smile on people’s faces like you’ve just put a smile on mine! “I really appreciate your call!” The winning numbers in Powerball draw 1452 on Thursday 14 March 2024 were 30, 24, 5, 32, 35, 27 and 15. The all-important Powerball number was 2.
