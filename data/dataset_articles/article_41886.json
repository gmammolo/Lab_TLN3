  "text": "Operations Man Rescued From Oswego (NY) Harbor After Entering Water To Save Dog A man and his dog were rescued Wednesday night after jumping from Cahill Pier at Oswego Harbor to save his dog. 03.14.2024 Share Fernando Alba – syracuse.com A man and his dog were rescued Wednesday night after jumping from Cahill Pier at Oswego Harbor to save his dog, firefighters said. A bystander called 911 to report the man entering the water at 7:38 p.m., Oswego Fire Department Chief Paul Conzone said in a news release. The 911 caller said that the man was struggling in the water and couldn’t make it back to shore, Conzone said. The bystander lowered a piece of clothing for the man to hold onto until rescuers could arrive, he said. Firefighters found the man next to the pier in 42-degree water and about 170 yards from shore, the fire chief said. At that temperature, a person can become unconscious in 30 to 60 minutes and die in one to three hours, experts estimate. Crews entered the water at 7:45 p.m. and stabilized the man and his dog before they were taken onto a U.S. Coast Guard boat, Conzone said. The man was taken to a hospital for evaluation, he said.
