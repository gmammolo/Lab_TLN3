  "text": "TOLEDO, Ohio (WTVG) - One local elementary school is working to combat feelings of sadness and loneliness by adding an important piece of equipment to the playground.It started with an entire club dedicated to kindness. Now, New Riegel Elementary School has two new additions to its playground, Buddy Benches. “I make up funny things and then I tell it to people and they laugh so much I start to laugh,” a student at New Riegel Elementary School said.Bethany Bowler, an intervention specialist at the elementary school said she took two years to familiarize the kids with the concept of a Buddy Bench. She said, if someone is feeling sad or lonely, they can go sit on the bench, showing their classmate they need a friend. “When they’re sitting on it, I can go up and say, ‘Hey you wanna play with me or something?’” Bowler said. Bowler said the bench is meant to teach the kids empathy. The Students in Kindness Club said they are looking forward to making more friends and making an impact in their school. The students said they hope to inspire other schools to do the same. Latest Local News | First Alert Weather | Crime | National | 13abc Originals Copyright 2024 WTVG. All rights reserved.",
