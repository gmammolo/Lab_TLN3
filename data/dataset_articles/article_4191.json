  "text": "On Jan. 9, St. Johns County Fire Rescue dedicated a permanent Fallen Firefighter Memorial honoring firefighters who lost their lives in the line of duty and recognizing the courage, sacrifice and commitment that define the profession. The ceremony also included the dedication of the department’s 9/11 Memorial, symbolized by a tree planted at the site to commemorate the lives lost on Sept. 11, 2001, and the sacrifices of first responders.\nThe memorial was created to provide the department and the community with a lasting place for remembrance, reflection and healing. It is located at St. Johns County Fire Rescue Headquarters, 3657 Gaines Road, St. Augustine.\n“This memorial ensures that their names, their service and their sacrifice endure beyond our lifetimes,” said Sean McGee, St. Johns County Fire Rescue chief. “It gives future generations a place to learn what it truly means to serve selflessly.”\nMcGee emphasized that firefighting is a profession defined by courage and responsibility, noting that every call carries uncertainty and risk.\n“For some, that call became their last,” he said. “Their sacrifice is not measured only in the moments of service we remember, but in the crews they stood beside, the community they served with honor and in the families they loved.”\nMcGee also addressed the families of fallen firefighters, acknowledging their loved ones’ lasting impact on the department.\n“Your loved ones are forever part of this department’s story,” he said. “Their sacrifice guides us. Their memory strengthens us. And their names will always be spoken with honor.”\nThe names of the fallen firefighters inscribed on the memorial include:\nThe memorial project began as an idea and moved forward through months of planning and design before construction officially broke ground on May 15, 2024. County officials recognized Fire Rescue Engineer Chris Naff for carrying the project from its earliest concept through completion, ensuring the memorial became a permanent and meaningful tribute.\nCounty Commission Chair Clay Murphy said the memorial serves a meaningful purpose for both the department and the community.\n“This memorial exists for a clear and necessary reason,” Murphy said. “It gives this department and this community a permanent place to recognize firefighters who lost their lives while serving others. Their work mattered. Their sacrifice mattered.”\nMurphy emphasized the responsibility firefighters accept when responding to emergencies and the lasting legacy of those honored at the memorial.\n“When a call comes in, they go — often into uncertainty, danger and risk — because someone else needs help,” he said. “For the individuals honored here, that responsibility ultimately came at the highest cost.”\nMurphy also addressed the families of fallen firefighters, expressing the county’s gratitude and commitment to remembrance.\n“To the families of our fallen firefighters: St. Johns County does not take your loss lightly,” he said. “This memorial ensures they will always have a place here — one that reflects the respect owed to them and the gratitude this county carries.”\nCommissioners Christian Whitehurst, Sarah Arnold and Ann Taylor joined Murphy at the ceremony to pay respects to the fallen firefighters and their families.\nCounty and Fire Rescue leaders said the memorial will serve as a source of strength for Fire Rescue personnel and the community, reinforcing the values of service, integrity and responsibility.\nThe Fallen Firefighter Memorial and 9/11 Memorial will remain permanent tributes, ensuring that these heroes will always be remembered.",
