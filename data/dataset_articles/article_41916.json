To date, the program has helped about 225 Ohioans and the organization says nearly all of them say it’s helped their social life in one way or another.\n“Being able to grow that relationship and continue to serve more people every year is great. Over 220 people this year with waitlists that we can’t keep up with shows that we’ve built something that not only is needed, but brings joy to people’s lives,” said Central Community House executive director, Tamar Forrest.\nSince 2020, Spectrum has awarded $75,000 in grants to the Central Community House.
