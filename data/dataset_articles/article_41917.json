  "text": "BLUEFIELD, W. Va. ( WVVA /Gray News) - The lives of stray cats don’t always have happy endings, but the survival of one lucky cat in West Virginia is helping to show how love and affection can beat even unlikely odds.\nSecond Chance for Cats is not a stranger to rescuing strays. The shelter houses many felines waiting for their forever homes.\nIt recently took in an injured stray named Sapphire and found out that what first appeared to be a broken leg was actually a broken neck.\nElizabeth MacDonald, the co-founder and treasurer of Second Chance for Cats, said it was the first time the shelter had seen that sort of injury.\n“We’ve had some broken legs before, we’ve had broken tails, but we have never had anything that’s been this severe,” she said.\nSapphire had fractured his C7 vertebra, leaving him almost unable to move. He had to be hand-fed, couldn’t use the litter box, and had to be moved often to prevent bedsores. Second Chance for Cats reached out to veterinarians for help but were told that Sapphire’s survival was unlikely.\nDr. Mark French, a veterinarian with Ridge Animal Hospital , said he told MacDonald that the chance of Sapphire regaining his functionality was “almost zero.”\n“I think I used the term ‘might be miraculous’ if it could ever walk again,” he said.\nFrench said it was unusual for surgery attempts to be made on animals with broken necks. Sapphire was also just four months old, meaning his soft and small bones would require extra care.\nDespite the setback, MacDonald believed it was not the size of the cat in the fight but the size of the fight in the cat and did what she could to help Sapphire recover.\n“From the very first day that we got this cat, there was just something in that cat’s eyes. And it was like he wanted to survive,” she said.\nShe spoke with her co-worker, and the two agreed that they would do everything in their power to help Sapphire survive.\n“And that’s what we did,” McDonald said.\nFrench was able to install a plate on Sapphire’s small spine through incisions in the top and bottom of his neck. If the surgery was successful, French estimated the cat would be able to walk within four months.\nHowever, under the watchful eye of his surgeon and rescuers, Sapphire was wobbly walking in three weeks.\n“Elizabeth and her group, I think that they have put in a whole lot of work and they certainly are, what do they call themselves, Second Chance? Well, by golly, that’s what they’re into, giving cats a second chance,” French said.\nFrench said Sapphire changed his outlook on what is possible. MacDonald said she hopes the cat’s success story will inspire others going through difficult times to keep their head up and keep fighting.\nMacDonald also wanted to give credit to the people who donated the $5,000 to make the surgery possible. She said Sapphire will stay at Second Chance for Cats while he heals, but plans to have him up for adoption when he is ready.\nCopyright 2024 WVVA via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",
