  "text": "ROCK SPRINGS – Key topics during this year's State of the City Address included caring for one another as neighbors, collaborating with other entities, local progress and mental health struggles within the community.\nMickelson spoke to constituents at Santa Fe Southwest Grill on Thursday, March 14.\nTrue grit\nMickelson shared the story of two brothers, Archibald and Duncan Blair; they opened a coal mine in 1868 on a windswept, hardscrabble chunk of the Wyoming Territory.\n“Nobody lost their mind. They didn't lose their drive or their grit,” he said. “Their descendants, the Hay Family, opened Rock Springs National Bank in 1892, four years after Rock Springs became incorporated as a city.”\nThe bank will be celebrating their 132nd anniversary on June 10 and is still run by the same family.\n“The demand for coal by the Union Pacific Railroad fed our community's growth,” he continued. “We were the company town known as the home of 56 nationalities. Their practice back then was to bring in folks from countries all over the world, from lots of different cultures, because it helped keep people separate. It was their effort to prevent unionization and life was good and everyone had their own little community within the greater community of our city.”\nHe noted that when mine employees worked, they worked for their very life culture, “where taking care of each is the norm.”\n“In our city, that culture has survived into the 21st century. We know how to pull together both in good times and in bad,” he said. “That dependency creates a special culture. As good as the early days were during the Great Depression, things weren't so good. By 1933, one quarter of our town relied on soup kitchens for meals, a parallel to today where 46% of our K-12 students are on the free or reduced lunch.”\nHe pointed out that while Union Pacific provided some assistance, the real heroes were people like the Hay Family. They had seen how our city and its people were suffering when folks couldn't pay their notes, but instead of punishing them for it, they worked with them to come up with better solutions.\nPartnerships\nAccording to Mickelson, the city of Rock Springs has very strong relationships with their partners, working continuously and collaboratively with local, state and federal partners. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) allowed the city to put in a detention pond to reduce flooding on the Northeast side of town.\nFrom the Sweetwater County Commissioners to the Wyoming Legislature, Gov. Gordon’s office and state agencies, he said that the relationships have been “fruitful and positive.” They also continue to grow their relationship with the Sweetwater Economic Development Coalition, the Sweetwater Events Complex, Rock Springs Main Street/Urban Renewal Agency, Sweetwater Travel and Tourism, SCSD1, Western Wyoming Community College, Memorial Hospital of Sweetwater County, Aspen Medical Center and many others.\nMickelson took a moment to acknowledge the work that the district and legislative members did in accomplishing the funding for the new high school in Rock Springs.\n“We are working closely with our business partners, both old and new, to ensure that the prosperity of our city continues.”\nHe admitted that communication with all constituents can be challenging to accomplish, but the city of Rock Springs is finding ways to make it easier, assuring them the city wants to hear from them and that “it is safe to share their concerns.”\n“Reaching those who are disengaged from government has been difficult,” he added. “Nevertheless, we have persisted; we see the value of having an ongoing conversation with the citizens of our city.”\nMickelson and city officials have been speaking on radio shows, providing updates around issues facing the community and celebrate the successes.\n“Nevertheless, our challenges haven't vanished. We still have buildings that need upkeep, roads that need improved or maintained to the industry needs, equipment aging out of usefulness, and a massive affordable housing gap,” he said, mentioning that we can ‘knock on wood’ and hope for the best. “The reality is, though, things are looking really good for Rock Springs.\n“We are looking at how we can position our city to be as strong as it can going forward.”\nHe said that sales and use taxes are strong. They are ahead of their budget projection and “the forecast is excellent.” It is tempting, however, to use those funds to add amenities, but the city’s leader cautions against this.\n“Despite being a wild old hippie, author Kurt Vonnegut was not wrong when he said. “Flaw in the human character is that everyone wants to build, and nobody wants to do maintenance.”\nHe encourages the community to focus on what would the most cost-effective use of tax dollars would be in delivering “the highest quality of service.”\n“We must align our city to meet the needs of industrial growth while we diversify that same industrial and business space to move beyond our boom and bust cycle. We must engender an environment where housing development is attractive enough to developers to shrink our affordable housing gap for this coming fiscal year.”\nThe city of Rock Springs is currently working on a comprehensive and stakeholder driven strategic plan for the parks and recreation system.\n“We will decide as a community where our focus should be and how to best meet the needs of our city.”\nThe city of Rock Springs will distribute surveys to see how they align with our city’s residents’ priorities. He said that surveys will be sent during the next budget cycle for the mayor and city council to make fully informed decisions. He also plans to distribute short monthly update videos to keep citizens informed about the city government's activities. They are also working to select consultants who specialize in reviewing municipal code.\n“The intent is to have them evaluate our ordinances to see what we need.”\nMental Health Crisis\nMickelson expressed that the one thing that is very near to his heart is the mental health crisis of our community.\n“And make no mistake, there is a crisis.”\n“If we do not find the will to address this, our other efforts and successes will always be diminished,” he said. “Our suicide rate is appalling, heartbreaking and unacceptable. We are losing so many people.”\nTo address this, city officials are working on assembling a task force to develop actionable steps to provide resources to those who are struggling.\n“Amid our current prosperity and growth, we cannot fully celebrate until we address this openly, concretely and productively. We will need to rely on each other here as strongly as we have in facing our past challenges, and we must fully embrace the mining culture that brought people from 56 different nations and cultures together as one community to tackle this critical issue.”\nPreparing for growth\n“I believe all of us are ready to take that courageous first step of embracing the adventure of change, knowing we are a community that takes care of each other and stands together,” Mickelson said, noting that a big boom is heading to the Southwest region and that the public shouldn’t let persistent negativity on social media get them down.\n“We live in an incredibly, increasingly prosperous community filled with good people who have maintained their culture of mutual support. We are truly blessed beyond measure. There will always be those who take pleasure in tearing down the good around them.”\nHe pointed out that Rock Springs hasn’t always had the best reputation because “we let those loud few tell our story.”\n“We, the majority, can and must use our voices to tell the true story of our city.”\nHe said, “Our community reminds me of this. Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor. If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. As we move forward, we must preserve our sense of community by supporting our local businesses, participating in our community events, and most importantly, looking out for our neighbors.\n“Together, we will continue to build on our history for a prosperous and bright tomorrow.”\nLet the news come to you\nGet any of our free email newsletters — news headlines, sports, arts & entertainment, state legislature, CFD news, and more.\n[Explore newsletters](/newsletters/)",
