  "text": "Roundabout Canberra founder and CEO Hannah Andrevski has been named the 2024 Canberra Citizen of the Year in recognition of her commitment to supporting families in need. Ms Andrevski founded Roundabout Canberra in 2018 after trying to find a service where she could donate pre-loved belongings her children no longer needed. Roundabout Canberra provides essential baby and children's items to families in need across the Canberra region. Since the beginning of 2024 alone, the organisation has already helped hundreds of children and gifted thousands of items. Ms Andrevski was a 2019 Westfield Local Hero and a nominee for the 2020 ACT Local Hero award. She also won the Galent Management Consulting Profound Influence Award at the 2019 Volunteering Awards, Canberra Region. Quotes attributable to ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr: \"Under Hannah Andrevski's leadership, Roundabout Canberra ensures dignity is at the forefront of its charitable efforts, driven by the belief that everyone – regardless of their circumstances – deserves to be treated with kindness and respect. \"This approach has ensured the organisation continues to contribute to a compassionate and supportive community, while ensuring families receive the material items they need. \"I congratulate Ms Andrevski on this well-deserved recognition and wish Roundabout Canberra all the best over the next 12 months and beyond.\" Quotes attributable to 2024 Canberra Citizen of the Year Hannah Andrevski: \"It's hard to express how much this award means to me. \"I'm a very proud and passionate Canberran, having grown up here, and now raising my own family here. I care deeply about our community and want to play a role in making it a better place for all of us to live. \"It's a privilege to get to do what I do – to provide much needed support to families in our community in a way that upholds their dignity.\" [here](/roundabout-canberras-hannah-andrevski-named-1195397/).",
