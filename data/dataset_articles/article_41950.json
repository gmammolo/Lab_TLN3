  "text": "Fair Acres Geriatric Center has done it again.\nFor the second consecutive year, the county-owned and operated facility in Lima has ranked as one of the country’s top nursing homes while getting a five-star federal rating and being found deficiency free.\nAnd, this time, they did it on top of\na federal lawsuit against the county for a death that occurred there during the pandemic. The case was closed last summer after a confidential settlement was reached.\nHaving been serving county residents for 200 years, Fair Acres is the largest skilled nursing unit in Delaware County and provides long-term care for any adult, regardless of age, with a demonstrated need for 24-hour-a-day nursing care. The facility also offers short-term rehabilitation stays and serves as a geriatric training site for local colleges, universities and nursing schools.\nThe Fair Acres Geriatric Center was lauded by Delaware County Council for recently garnering a trifecta of accomplishments, all for the second time in a row.\nFirst, Newsweek named Fair Acres Geriatric Center as one of America’s Best Nursing Homes for 2024.\nOut of 12,273 nursing homes across the United States, Newsweek picked the top 750 for this distinction based on performance data, peer recommendations, the handling of COVID-19, the facility’s accreditations and resident satisfaction.\nSecondly, the Pennsylvania Department of Health did a four-day unannounced visit to assess operations and found no deficiencies at the 435-bed facility.\nAnd, thirdly, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that oversees nursing homes, gave Fair Acres another five-star rating.\nA team effort\n“We’re very happy and I couldn’t do it without my staff,” Fair Acres Administrator Bill D’Amico said of the 850 employees there. “They all play a part in that. You can’t drive the ship if you don’t have people working on the engines.”\nDelaware County Council agreed.\n“Congratulations and thank you for all your work,” Council Chair Dr. Monica Taylor said. “You and the team — there’s a massive team at Fair Acres that makes all of this happen — Thank you for all that you’ve done for our residents and for your work to keep us at this high level of rating in the state and across the country.”\n“I and all of council congratulate our hard-working team at Fair Acres led by its Administrator Bill D’Amico … for this truly well-earned distinction,” Councilwoman Christine Reuther said. “We all know that the last few years have been extraordinarily challenging for those in health care so the physicians, the nurses, the therapists, the custodial staff, maintenance, the dietary staff, the plumbers, the security, the whole team that makes Fair Acres hum … thank you and congratulations.”\nD’Amico said the facility plans a Recognition Day for employees next week as banners have been ordered to display these achievements.\nReuther also addressed the Newsweek ranking.\n“Out of over 12,000 nursing homes analyzed across the country, Newsweek selected the top 6%,” she said. “That’s just 750 nursing homes for recognition … Fair Acres ranked 26th among Pennsylvania’s nursing homes and the only nursing home in Delaware County to receive the honor. That is pretty impressive”\nD’Amico noted that the peer recommendations are made by people outside of the facility and added that Fair Acres does not know who is chosen to give those recommendations.\nHe also spoke to the state Department of Health evaluation, which granted a zero deficiency survey to Fair Acres last month.\n“440 beds are occupied and there’s not a single deficiency in the audit,” Reuther said.\nWhile thanking council members for their continued support, D’Amico explained that that’s a challenging achievement to reach.\n“The average 100-bed nursing home gets an average of seven deficiencies from the state when they come out,” he said. “We received zero deficiencies this survey and zero deficiencies last year.”\nAnd, then, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sorted through submitted data to bestow Fair Acres with its five-star rating.\n“We have to report whatever happens to a resident: an ulcer, a fall, etc.” D’Amico said. “As long as there’s the right intervention, there’s no deficiencies.\nHe said even delays to doctors’ appointments are part of this evaluation, as is a full kitchen inspection, assessing cleanliness and temperature of food.\nThe lawsuit\nThis second round of accolades comes following a settlement reached last summer on behalf of Christopher Beaty Jr. and Nichole Garcia, who alleged Delaware County failed to design or enact policies to limit the spread of COVID-19 in Fair Acres, leading to the death of 63-year-old Christopher Beaty Sr. after he was exposed to the virus through his roommate.\nLast summer, U.S. District Court Judge Paul S. Diamond issued an order dismissing the action after the family members and Delaware County entered into a confidential agreement.\nAsked about how the accomplishments fare against this court action, D’Amico said, “It’s how you react.”\nHe noted that many times, nursing homes are only noted for bad things as evident by advertisements asking the public about suing nursing homes.\n“For years, county homes were known as the last stand,” D’Amico said. “We were known as this is the last place to go. We changed that dynamic in Delaware County.”\nHe gave special notice to his staff for making that happen.\n“They worked very hard to get to where we are today,” D’Amico said.\nReuther noted the vulnerable populations served by the facility and all those who work at Fair Acres.\n“It’s 98% Medicaid,” she said. “That’s 98% of people who aren’t private pay or eligible for Medicare. It’s paid for out of medical assistance for the elderly. It is a huge part of our safety net and to have such a tremendously competent facility doing that kind of work is really important and impressive.”\nFair Acres is licensed for 774 beds but has been limited as renovations have been occurring on the top three floors of Building 8 on its campus. On Thursday, county officials plan to host a ribbon cutting to symbolize the completion of renovations to meet the updated fire code and allowing for another 110 beds to open.",
