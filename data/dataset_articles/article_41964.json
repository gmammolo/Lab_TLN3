  "text": "“Pi Day” holds special meaning for Belleville family MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - March 14 is “Pi Day.” People often celebrate by enjoying their favorite slice of their pie. But this year, “Pi Day” means so much more to one woman in Belleville and her family. Katie O’Dair spent much of her life surrounded by pie. Her parents, Beth and Charlie, had a passion for the sweet treat. WMTV 15 news featured Beth and Charlie in a story 5 years ago on March 14 -- Pi Day. The couple sold 200 pies in 45 minutes. “Everyone just loved them. Like there is no pie like a Beth pie, right,” said O’Dair. But in January 2023, Beth passed away after battling cancer. Shortly later, Charlie’s health took a turn for the worse and he passed away in September. “It’s been rough. it sometimes feels like you are glad they are at peace, but you wish they were still here,” O’Dair said. To help keep their memory alive, O’Dair turned to a former co-worker, Sara Stoltman, who also has a passion for baking. She is a retired nurse now running her own small business, [Thread Maven Stitching](https://threadmavenstitching.com/). O’Dair asked Stoltman if she could turn her mom’s contest ribbons into a quilt. Stoltman said she liked the idea but didn’t know if she could pull it off. “I was scared to death to sew with these,” Stoltman said. But Stoltman was up for the challenge and got to work on her sewing machine. Stitching fabric together, piece by piece, to create a memorial for a beloved couple and their passion for pie. “This is what I love to do,” Stoltman said. After some trial and error, Stoltman crafted a tapestry in honor of Beth and Charlie. “She came up with this and it could not have been more perfect,” O’ Dair said. The plan is to put this slice of creativity on display this summer at the Stoughton Fair with the hopes to win just one more ribbon. The quilt serves as a reminder that life may be short…but it sure is sweet.
