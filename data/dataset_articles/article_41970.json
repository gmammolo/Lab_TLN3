  "text": "UPI – A library in Massachusetts, United States, is offering a unique way for patrons to settle their fines: cat pictures. The Worcester Public Library introduced its ‘March Meowness’ programme, running until the month’s end, allowing fines to be paid off by submitting a photo or drawing of a cat instead of cash. “Even if you don’t own a cat, you can still participate by drawing one,” said Jason Homer, executive director of the Worcester Public Library. “Whether it’s a domestic cat or a big cat like a tiger or lion, we’d love to see them all,” he said. The library said the programme was inspired when officials noticed a large number of young patrons had amassed significant fines since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. They said more than 400 accounts were cleared of fines during the first five days of the month. The library’s website clarified that the programme is not limited to images of felines. “We will accept honorary cats as well, so you may show us a picture or drawing of a dog, raccoon, orca, capybara or any other animal.”",
