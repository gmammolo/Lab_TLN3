  "text": "AUGUSTA-- Supporters of Family Planning Services Are Urging Lawmakers to Fund a Bill That Would Provide Greater Access to Them.The Bill, LD 1478 Received Initial Approval from Both the House and Senate Last Year, but Is Waiting on the Special Appropriations Table to Receive Funding.If Passed, the Bill Would Allocate Around $3.4 Million Every Year to Maine Family Planning Services.Advocates Say the Increasing Funding Is Needed to Continue Providing Adequate Care.Representative Michele Meyer, a cosponsor of the bill says \"This Network Serves Patients Across the State and Provides Essential Health Care Many Would Otherwise Not Have Access to Including Cancer Screenings, Behavioral Health Care and Primary Care. For Many Patients, Their Family Planning Visit Is, as Senator Pierce Says, the Only Health Care Interaction They Have Each Year.\"The Bill's Sponsor, Senator Teresa Pierce (Purse) Says She Is Confident the Bill Will Be Funded in the Last Few Weeks of the Legislative Session.
