  "text": "ALLENTOWN, Pa. - Rosalind Lucien understands the power of education. She's the founder of The Thrive Hub, a nonprofit that serves to lift up and inspire underserved high school students.\n\"We focus on helping students raise their academic credit score, so they can minimize and eliminate student loan debt. How you move in high school, your academic credit score, is actually currency that can set you up for the rest of your life,\" Lucien said. \"There is an infinite amount of success. All of our children can win.\"\nThrive's Career Exploration Conference at Muhlenberg College brings together around 300 students across two days to work on four key areas.\n\"Academic success, personal/profession development, physical and mental health, and financial fitness,\" Lucien said.\nStudents meet with and hear from a variety of professionals, like Stephanie Lugo, better known as Ms. Robotics, who was on hand to teach students about coding and the STEM fields.\n\"They are Black and brown professionals who look like the students,\" Lucien said.\n\"I definitely think programs like this make you feel more motivated to achieving your goals,\" said Natiya Natal, a senior at Liberty.\nNatal credits Thrive for helping her navigate the college process. She'll be attending Howard in the fall for civil engineering.\nLucien says last year, her kids received over $1 million combined in scholarships.\n\"I feel like his programs are really important on getting you on the right track. I feel like it's really hard to figure out the college process and figure out the academic process if your parents don't know about it,\" Natal said.\n\"You just have to try,\" Lucien said. \"We've created the safest environment for the kids to be brave.\"\nScroll down for comments if available\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save",
