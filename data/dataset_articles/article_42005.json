  "text": "By Thomas Neumann ,\n1 hour ago\nCaitlin Clark is a big fan of Luke Combs, and the feeling is mutual.\nThe former Iowa Hawkeyes standout was selected No. 1 overall in the 2024 WNBA draft on Monday night, to the surprise of nobody in the women’s basketball world. She’s headed to the Indiana Fever, and 36 of the team’s 40 games will be televised nationally this season as a direct result of her popularity.\nIn the moments following Clark’s draft selection, she was treated to a congratulatory video from the country music star.\n“I just wanted to say congratulations on being the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft. That’s incredible,” Combs said. “I know I can speak for everybody all across the United States and the world, probably, that we’ve enjoyed watching you these last couple years, and we can’t wait to continue to do so. So congratulations. You earned it. Can’t wait to see you out there.”\nClark was clearly elated by the message.\n“Luke Combs! That’s my favorite artist of all time,” Clark said. “That’s pretty cool. He’s a big women’s basketball fan, so I appreciate him. That’s amazing. I was not expecting that!”\nClark makes her WNBA preseason debut when the Fever visit the Dallas Wings on May 3. Her regular-season pro debut will be a road game against the Connecticut Sun on May 14 at 7:30 p.m. ET. That game will be broadcast on ESPN2.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
