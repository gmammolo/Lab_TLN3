The devices contain valuable precious metals, making them a prime target for thieves to sell them on the black market. According to the [National Insurance Crime Bureau](https://www.nicb.org/news/news-releases/catalytic-converter-thefts-surge-nationwide-according-new-report), the nation experienced more than 64,000 catalytic converter thefts in 2022 alone. Leading the country in catalytic converter thefts were California and Texas. Experts say the problem is not getting any better. “Prices are still increasing – gold, silver, platinum, rhodium. The precious metals in the cats {catalytic converter} – it’s still increasing. It’s still in the market,” said Scott Kennard of [Darling’s Ford-VW-Audi](https://www.darlingsford.com/) in Bangor. He says it’s a problem hitting not just consumers but businesses and first responders. “Ambulances, delivery trucks, fire trucks – vehicles that don’t move often. Due to the supply chain interruption, we have had ambulances that have had to sit for six months with no parts,” he explained. Getting one replaced is going to cost you. “Generally, it can range from $1,000 to $1,300 but that’s just a rough idea,” said Nathan Paulauskas, a 2nd-year automotive technology student. Under a Maine law that went into effect in 2022, new and used vehicles sold by a dealer in the state must have a VIN number engraved on the catalytic converter. “It saves you a little bit of headache in case your catalytic converter does get stolen. Your VIN on your cat is going through this random junkyard. They may contact you and you might be able to get your cat back, and the person that stole it will also probably have to pay for the replacement of it.” Experts say while the VIN number may not make it less likely for the part to be stolen, it does make it harder to sell. “The recycling plants, if they receive a cat with a VIN {number} on it, they have to check that VIN out. If you’re caught with a truck full of catalytic converters that have VIN numbers on it, they can be cross-referenced in a database,” Kinnard said. Next week you can have your catalytic converter marked for free. Eastern Maine Community College is hosting an “Etch and Catch” program on Tuesday, April 23rd from 8 a.m. to noon. “The Criminal Justice Academy students are going to help liaison people over to our shop and the Automotive students are going to etch the converter per state law on the vehicles that need to have their converters etched,” said Chris Davis, automotive department chair at Eastern Maine Community College. “Etch and Catch” programs are popping up across the country, to aid in the recovery of the converters should they be stolen. Experts say drivers can take some simple steps to help prevent theft. “Vary your routine,” Kinnard said. “Thieves look for habits. Move your car around. Know your surroundings.” To pre-register for a specific timeslot email: Investigations.bmv@maine.gov. Copyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",
