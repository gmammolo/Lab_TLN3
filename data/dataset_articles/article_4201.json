  "text": "By STAFF REPORTS ,\n12 hours ago Two police cars are parked in front of the Tippecanoe County Courthouse. After Sunday's shooting of j udge Steven Meyer, there has been increased police presence at the courthouse. Andrew Coleman | Photo & Video Editor Security at the Tippecanoe County Courthouse has ratcheted up after judge Steven Meyer and his wife Kim were shot at their home in Lafayette Sunday. The FBI are now involved in the manhunt as the shooter is still at large.\nMeyer, the judge who was shot about 2 p.m. in the 1700 block of Mill Pond Lane, is still recovering from his wounds in the arm.\n“I want the community to know that I have strong faith in our judicial system,” Meyer said. “This horrific violence will not shake my belief in the importance of peacefully resolving disputes. I remain confident we have the best judicial system in the world, and I am proud to be a part of it.”\nMultiple agencies including the Lafayette Police Department Violent Crimes Unit, LPD Crime Scene Investigators, and Tippecanoe County Prosecutors Office Major Crimes Unit are working to find the shooter, an LPD press release said.\nThe LPD is urging anyone with any tips to call the police department at (765) 807-1200.\nKim, who was injured in the hip, is out of the hospital and expressed gratitude for the law enforcement and the outpouring of support from the community.\n“Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Meyer family,” Lafayette Mayor Tony Roswarski said. “I want to assure the community that every available resource is being used to apprehend the individual(s) responsible for this senseless unacceptable act of violence. I have tremendous confidence in the Lafayette Police Department and I want to thank all of the local, state, and federal agencies who are assisting in this investigation.”\nIndiana Chief Justice Loretta Rush released an alert to judges throughout the state of Indiana urging them to “stay vigilant” after the shooting, according to a statement from her office.\n“I worry about the safety of all our judges,” Rush wrote in the letter to judges. “As you work to peacefully resolve more than 1 million cases a year, you must not only feel safe, you must also be safe. Any violence against a judge or a judge's family is completely unacceptable. As public servants, you are dedicated to the rule of law.”\nThe courts have been impacted by the shooting with at least two or three security personnel on each floor of the courthouse.\nSuperior Court 2, which Meyer presides over, handles major criminal cases, including murders and level one through five felonies alongside civil cases. The court system has worked to make sure cases are still moving through.\n“There has been an overwhelming outpouring of support from judges throughout the state offering to assist in any way,” Tippecanoe Judge Sean Persin said in a statement. “We want to assure the community that the cases in Tippecanoe Superior Court No. 2 will continue to be heard in a timely manner.”",
