  "text": "SAN ANTONIO — Every May for the past 40 years the National Trust for Historic Preservation has celebrated Preservation month. And one of those events in downtown San Antonio aims to teach participants about the heritage, cultures, and ideas that make our city unique, in a fun way. Its called \"The Amazing Preservation Race.\" It is the only race of it's kind in the Alamo City. Teams of four will follow clues and complete challenges as they learn and use knowledge about San Antonio and it's rich history. And the City wants you to participate. Shannon Miller, the Director of Office of Historic Preservation said, \"Teams of four adults must follow clues that help them identify historic spots in downtown San Antonio. And then they have to complete either a mental or physical challenge in order to get their passport filled and complete all the challenges and get back to the finish line.\" And it isn't just for the adults. \"It's really intended to help us celebrate and also highlight the the built heritage and the culture and traditions that make San Antonio special,\" said Miller. The challenges are top secret and spread out across three miles of downtown. Races can use cellphones to decipher clues that are based in San Antonio's history and architecture. You can only use your feet to get around, no public transit or rideshares. Prizes will be awarded to the top three finishers, best costume, and best team spirit. Miller added, \"You also have to complete some detours along the way that are not location specific. So it might be taking a photo with a dog or something along those lines that are one of the detour options.\" And for those that race, it is a two-fer! Miller said, \"Amazing preservation race is really a fun way to get people both out in the community being active, but then also just really learning about San Antonio's local history and culture. The race takes place Friday, May 3 at 6:30 p.m. at Legacy Park. People can sign up until Apr. 30.",
