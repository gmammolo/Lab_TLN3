  "text": "Haley Cavinder reversed her commitment to TCU on Thursday, saying she was returning to Miami after a year off. Haley and twin sister Hanna Cavinder played three seasons at Fresno State, then transferred to Miami for the 2022-23 season. After the Hurricanes' run to the Elite Eight in the 2022-23 season, the twins announced their retirement to pursue other interests. But last fall, Haley Cavinder announced her plan to play in 2024-25 at TCU, using her final season of eligibility. On Thursday, a day after Hanna said she was heading back to Miami for one final lap, Haley Cavinder said on social media that she would be putting on the Hurricanes uniform again. \"Given the news yesterday that my sister was returning to play ball at Miami and after careful consideration and thought, I've decided to return to the University of Miami and play with Hanna for our final and 5th year,\" Haley Cavinder, 23, announced on social media. \"There is nothing more important than family and the bond I share with my Twin sister. Being presented with the opportunity to play together one more time is something I cannot pass up. I am excited for this upcoming season and can't wait to play at the U.\" Haley Cavinder was a three-time All-Mountain West selection at Fresno State. In her one season at Miami, she averaged 12.2 points, 4.9 rebounds and 2.5 assists in 35 starts. In her college career, she has played in 124 games (122 starts) and has averages of 16.7 points, 7.2 rebounds and 3.8 assists. ",
