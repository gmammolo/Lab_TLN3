  "text": "The North Ridgeville Corn Festival donated nearly $4,000 to the North Ridgeville police Tuesday to buy two automatic external defibrillators. John Butkowski, president of the North Ridgeville Corn Festival, presented the money during the City Council meeting. AEDs are used during medical emergencies involving cardiac arrests and improve a patient's chance of survival. \"We believe in giving back,\" Butkowski said. \"We always do.\" Following last year's festival, Butkowski said officials learned that the North Ridgeville Police Department needed to replace the two AEDs. \"We felt that that was something we could help with,\" Butkowski said. Butkowski told a representative of the police department during the meeting that \"hopefully you don't have to use them. In case you do, I think we're in good hands.\" In total, the donated funds for the two AEDs was $3,984. The city's Corn Festival, which has been celebrated in the community for half a century, is organized by a nonprofit committee. Proceeds of the annual event are given to educational programs, community projects and city departments, according to the committee's website. North Ridgeville Mayor Kevin Corcoran applauded the donation on Tuesday night. \"The Corn Festival's been around for obviously a long time, and there's a long history of giving back to the community,\" Corcoran said. \"And we appreciate the donation to the police department.\" Contact Garrett Looker at glooker@chroniclet.com.",
