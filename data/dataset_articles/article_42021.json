Directed by acclaimed filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn and narrated by Michelle Williams, the film delves into the monumental effort behind the telescope's construction and launch, set to orbit a million miles from Earth. As it explores never-before-seen cosmic landscapes and newly discovered exoplanets, \"Deep Sky\" prompts timeless questions about our origins and the vastness of the universe. With Kahn's track record of award-winning documentaries, including \"The Hunt for Planet B\" and \"My Architect,\" \"Deep Sky\" promises to immerse audiences in the beauty and mystery of space in a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. Join communications specialist Beth Johnson in a special conversation with director Nathaniel Kahn about the telescope, the filmmaking process, and how we share science with the world.
