  "text": "SANFORD (WGME) – Susan Lamoreau, who has been teaching financial literacy for more than 30 years, wishes she learned some of the things her students are now required to learn at the Sanford Regional Technical Center at Sanford High School. Lamoreau brought the GOOD DAY MAINE crew into one of her classes and talk to students about the curriculum and importance of learning about finances at a young age. “It’s a skill that you need for life and as they're making their plans to go onto college or go out into the workforce, and they change their mind and say 'business is not my forte, not what I want,' they still have these lifelong skills,” Lamoreau says. Andre Clark, a junior in Lamoreau’s class, tells us he is “very grateful that I can have this opportunity to take this class. I know so many other kids in this world would love to take this class, I'm just very lucky and fortunate I'm able to.” Classmates including Ethan Wilfong, Lexi Hayward, and Cullen St. Cyr echo this. During Financial Literacy Month, the Financial Authority of Maine (FAME) is [offering free tolls for students, adults, and employers](https://www.famemaine.com/) to both learn more about how to deal with their hard-earned cash and avoid getting into trouble financially. Mary Dyer is the financial education programs manager for FAME. She says one of the biggest concerns she sees is a lack of an emergency savings fund. “We studied data across the state and across the country: not enough people have efficient emergency savings set aside - to kind of weather that rainy day or that emergency in your lives,” Dyer says. Lamoreau thinks a class like hers should be required statewide.",
