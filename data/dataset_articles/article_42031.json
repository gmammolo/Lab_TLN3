  "text": "Jerome Robbins' Broadway Tony winner [Jason Alexander](https://www.playbill.com/person/jason-alexander-vault- 26044) will lead a new revival of [Fiddler on the Roof](https://www.playbill.com/production/fiddler-on-the-roof-imperial-theatre-vault- 6051) at California's La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts. Performances will run November 8–December 1 at the Los Angeles-area company, with opening night set for November 9. The production will reunite Seinfeld's Alexander, starring as Tevye, with his fellow Broadway [Merrily We Roll Along](https://www.playbill.com/production/merrily-we-roll-along-alvin-theatre-vault- 877) cast member [Lonny Price](https://www.playbill.com/person/lonny-price-vault- 19196), who is directing the new production. Lee Martino will choreograph. \"Fiddler on the Roof is one of the undeniable masterpieces of the American musical, and it has been a dream of mine to direct the show,\" says Price in a statement. \"And to think I get to work with my old friend Jason Alexander on this extraordinary piece really is a dream come true. I can think of no other actor more perfect to play Tevye, and I believe he will redefine the role (and the show) for a new generation!\" Adapted from the stories of [Sholom Aleichem](https://www.playbill.com/person/sholom-aleichem-vault- 13881), Fiddler on the Roof centers on Tevye the milkman as he attempts to maintain his Jewish traditions, challenged by new ideas from his five young daughters. The 1965 Best Musical Tony winner features a book by [Joseph Stein](https://www.playbill.com/person/joseph-stein-vault- 13511), music by [Jerry Bock](https://www.playbill.com/person/jerry-bock-vault- 4570), and lyrics by [Sheldon Harnick](https://www.playbill.com/person/sheldon-harnick-vault- 7340), with a score boasting such favorites as \"Tradition,\" \"Matchmaker, Matchmaker,\" \"If I Were a Rich Man,\" and \"Sunrise, Sunset.\" Further casting and creative team members are to be announced for the upcoming California production.
