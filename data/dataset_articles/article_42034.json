  "text": "Summary - The original USS Enterprise model from Star Trek has been returned to Gene Roddenberry's son after being missing since the 1970s. - The 3-foot version of the Enterprise featured in the 1960s Star Trek is now authenticated and set to be restored for public exhibition. - Rod Roddenberry plans to find a museum to showcase the iconic Enterprise model. The first model of the USS Enterprise used in Star Trek: The Original Series has been returned to Gene Roddenberry's son, Eugene \"Rod\" Roddenberry. Missing since the 1970s when Gene Roddenberry loaned it to the filmmakers of 1979's Star Trek: The Motion Picture, the 3-foot model of the Starship Enterprise was used in Star Trek's original pilot episode, \"The Cage,\" as well as the opening credits of Star Trek: The Original Series. The model popped up on eBay last fall, and the sellers took it down and then contacted Dallas-based Heritage Auctions to authenticate it. Yahoo! News reports that last weekend, the lost original model of Star Trek's USS Enterprise was returned to Rod Roddenberry. The now-found and authenticated Enterprise model was the prototype for the 11-foot version featured in the episodes of the 1960s Star Trek . The larger model is on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. Rod Roddenberry commented on the Enterprise model's return: “This is not going home to adorn my shelves. This is going to get restored and we’re working on ways to get it out so the public can see it and my hope is that it will land in a museum somewhere.” Rod Roddenberry also officially commented on the return of the lost USS Enterprise model on his Instagram (@eugeneroddenberryofficial): [ ](/star-trek-every-enterprise-version/) The Federation flagship, the USS Enterprise, has a long, fabled history, and each version of the classic Star Trek spacecraft has its own unique look. [ Star Trek: Every Version Of The Starship Enterprise ](/star-trek-every-enterprise-version/) How Star Trek's Lost USS Enterprise Model Was Returned To Roddenberry A vital piece of Star Trek history is finally home It was a long road for the original USS Enterprise model to return home to Rod Roddenberry. The 3-foot Enterprise model graced the desk of Gene Roddenberry, but after it was loaned out to https://screenrant.com/star-trek-original-series-cancelled-season-3-reason-why/, it vanished, and, “No one knew what happened to it,\" according to Rod Roddenberry. Heritage's Auction's executive vice president, Joe Maddalena, said the auction house was contacted by people who said they'd discovered the lost Enterprise model in a storage unit. It was brought to Heritage's Beverly Hills office where they instantly knew \"it was the real thing.\" Amusingly, Rod Roddenberry is also \"vindicated\" because of a long-running rumor that he destroyed the original Enterprise model as a boy by throwing it in a swimming pool. Joe Maddalena said the original USS Enterprise model could easily sell for $1-million at auction, but as a \"cultural icon,\" it is essentially \"priceless.\" Rod Roddenberry admits he has vague memories of the 3-foot Enterprise model, and he didn't think much about it until he was contacted when the model briefly appeared on eBay. Roddenberry said he appreciates that everyone involved agreed it was the right thing to do to return the model. Without going into details about the agreement reached, Roddenberry added, “I felt it important to reward that and show appreciation for that.” Roughly 50 years after it disappeared, a crucial piece of Star Trek history has finally come home.
