  "text": "Nashville, Tenn. – Meet the latest iteration of Twitty and Lynn. Fifty years ago, Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn—arguably the greatest country duet partners of all time—were in the midst of racking up 12 Top 10 hits, five #1 singles and four #1 albums, alongside solo careers that would see them become the country artist with the most #1s (at that time) and the most awarded female country artist, respectively.\nNow, the torch has been passed to a new generation. On April 20, 2024—Conway and Loretta’s grandchildren, Tre Twitty and Tayla Lynn, will release their first full-length album, Cookin’ Up Lovin’ —a 12-song compilation that includes three covers of duets made famous by their “Poppy” and “Memaw” and seven originals written with top country songwriters.\n· Pre-order/pre-save Cookin’ Up Lovin’ HERE\n· Pre-order vinyl copy of Cookin’ Up Lovin’ HERE\nTo make this release even more special, Tre and Tayla will celebrate by performing at the Grand Ole Opry for the fifth time in two years on May 2. Their initial Opry performance was “Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man,” which they sang on the very circle of wood where their grandparents once stood.\nProduced by Scott Baggett (John Waite, Alison Krauss), Cookin’ Up Lovin’ features covers of three of Conway and Loretta’s #1s as a duo: the Grammy-winning “After the Fire Is Gone” (1971), their signature hit “Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man” (1973) and their last #1 together, “Feelins’” (1975). Tre and Tayla’s versions, while more modern, are faithful adaptations.\nThe seven originals on the album, all co-written by the duo, include the saucy two-stepper “Cookin’,” written with veteran writer Mark Narmore and country recording artist Shelly Fairchild; the soulful, second-chance request of “Need Your Love (Give It Up),” penned with Mark Narmore and hit songwriter Liz Rose; the feisty “I Hate Me (For Lovin’ You),” written with legendary Nashville singer-songwriter Jeffrey Steele and Baggett, along with the barroom anthem “Hillbilly Git-Down” and a trio of love songs—the easy-lovin’ “Me and You,” sultry “Always Be You” and breezy “Thinkin’ of a Number,” all in collaboration with Narmore.\nThe album also includes “Spiders and Snakes,” a Jim Stafford single that Conway and Loretta covered, and a remake of Bruce Springsteen’s “I’m on Fire,” which was included as a loving tribute to Tayla’s mom—it was a favorite of hers and Tayla’s—who, sadly, passed away the night Tre and Tayla became a duo.\nBut that’s not all this duo is cookin’ up. “Twitty & Lynn: Together Again” is both the name of their brand-new podcast and a documentary series celebrating the enduring power of music, family legacies and the resilience of Tre and Tayla, who are determined to keep the music of their grandparents alive for generations to come. The podcast—produced by Nashville radio personality and country music historian Devon O’Day—debuted April 5, with over 350k views their first week, and delves into everything from Conway and Loretta to online dating in front of a studio audience dubbed the “Crack Pack.” The pilot episode of the docuseries—directed and edited by Steve Jawn and produced by Jawn and his wife Dani with The 10:10 Creative—will have a private screening in Nashville later this spring.\nCurrently on the road, Twitty & Lynn are already delivering their iconic grandparents’ hits—to which they will now add their own new music—to thousands, with nearly 120 dates booked nationwide in 2024. In perfect foil to one another, Tre takes a calm, methodical approach to performing, while Tayla arrives on stage with explosive energy, not unlike the way Conway tempered fiery Loretta for so many years. Though they are singing their grandparents’ songs, Tayla and Tre have their own individual styles and don’t attempt to duplicate those original performances. But once they start in on the heart-warming family stories interlaced throughout the two-and-a-half-hour show, fans will feel like they’ve been invited into the inner sanctum of these two amazing musical families.\nShortly before Loretta Lynn passed away, she commented, “I love Conway. I miss him so much. I know he would be so proud of Tre. I’m so proud of both of them for being out there, doing our show. Thank you all for loving our grandkids and being so good to them….”\nFor more information on Twitty & Lynn and a list of tour dates, visit the duo’s socials and twittyandlynn.com .\nCookin’ Up Lovin’ Track Listing\n1.
