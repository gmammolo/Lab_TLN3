  "text": "jam session\nFormerly homeless Austin band tunes up for 6th annual community concert\nThere's no shortage of conversations about the Austin music community, but it's not always clear who that includes. It could an in-crowd of successful locals or a larger selection of those who lived here at some point. It could be the underground punk scene or a kindred group of intellectuals coming out of the music program at the University of Texas.\nWhatever the boundaries, folks chatting at venues or reading local mags may not be thinking of a significant portion of the area's musicians: our unhoused neighbors.\nHome Street Music, a nonprofit that brings together professionals, volunteers, and formerly homeless artists at the Community First! Village, is working on integrating all of the above.\nThe program is hosting its sixth annual Community Awareness Event on May 18, showcasing a variety of musicians whose shared value is being involved in music together.\nThe free two-hour event is bookended by opening and closing remarks — plus a song — by Westlake High School\njazz musician Vidhur Seshadri. Founder of Home Street Music Vanessa Lively will take the reins for an introduction, and then six (or more) program participants will give an hour-long concert. After the music, some of the participants will share their personal stories.\nEach has a profile via Home Street that gives a taste of what kinds insights they may share:\n- Drummer and Navy veteran Jeff Vestal is a regular contributor at meetings, from setting up the event to \"hold[ing] down the rhythm section.\"\n- Percussionist Al Perez has had a hand in several areas of the music making, starting with shakers and later singing. He brings his bongos to meetings.\n- Singer Jim \"Jimmie Bones\" Lanzrath brings the blues, and is known for his skills in improvisation — an important aspect of communal music-making.\n- Poet Kate Stevenson, originally from the United Kingdom, debuts her work at meetings and contributes a friendly spirit that supports the interpersonal connection.\n- Musician Blair Racine, nicknamed \"The Mayor,\" facilitates collaboration by sharing stories and creative suggestions. Like a conductor or creative director, he finds what's special about each player.\n- Songwriter and Detroit native Scott Osborn gets into the nitty-gritty music theory, singing as well as playing the guitar and keyboard.\n\"Our goal is to create a safe space where individuals can express themselves through music, art, and community,\" said Lively in a press release. \"Through our programs, we have witnessed transformative changes in our participants, including boosted self-confidence, proud self-expression, and stronger connections to the greater community.”\nSome participants, like Osborn, have a long history with music, but others barely had any experience at all when starting out. Like many Community First\nprojects, these meetings highlight a wealth of talent that the local industry hasn't accessed or promoted, while inviting others in to develop their own skills.\n\"It really makes you feel special,” said folk musician and gathering leader\nJohann Wagner. “The sessions are really cover band meets original band meets best party in the world.”\nHome Street Music's sixth annual Community Awareness Event is free and family friendly. It will be held at St. Martin's (606 W. 15th Street) from 5-7 pm on May 18. RSVP on\nEventbrite.",
