  "text": "The Foreign Affairs Ministry in coordination with Sri Lanka Missions in Myanmar and Thailand facilitated the repatriation of eight Sri Lankans who were trafficked for forced criminal activities in cyber scamming compounds in Myanmar. Myanmar law enforcement authorities rescued these Sri Lankans on April 4, following the request by the Government of Sri Lanka. The Sri Lanka Embassy officials in Bangkok received them on April 11 at the Mae Sot border gate in Thailand, and subsequently they were brought to Bangkok and provided accommodation until their repatriation was arranged with the assistance of the International Organization for Migration. The International Organization for Migration provided logistical assistance in repatriating the rescued Sri Lankans. The Sri Lankan Embassy in Myanmar, through the Eden Foundation, a charity organization based in Myanmar, provided them with food and other necessities during their temporary stay at the Myawaddy Police Station following the rescue from traffickers. The Consular Affairs Division of the Ministry coordinated the repatriation process in collaboration with relevant stakeholders and Consular Affairs Director General of the Foreign Ministry A.S.K Senavirthne received the eight Sri Lankans at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA). The eight Sri Lankans expressed their appreciation to the Foreign Affairs Ministry for its efforts in ensuring their safe return to Sri Lanka. The Foreign Affairs Ministry thanked the Governments of Myanmar and Thailand and other stakeholders, including IOM for their assistance.",
