  "text": "News By Tag Industry News News By Location Country(s) |Th||We||Tu||Mo||Su||Sa||Fr| Embracing Peace for a Sustainable World Interactive Conference with Authors and Speakers Set for Saturday May 18 By: Lake Worth Interfaith Conference This event is a full day of learning, love, movement and meditation. The gathering will be held on Saturday, May 18, as a collaboration between the Lake Worth Interfaith Network, Jewish Temple Adath Or, and St. Andrews Episcopal Church. The goal is to foster deep awareness of the connections between inner and outer peace and the well-being of our planet. Highlights of the day include presentations by: Rabbi Marc Labowitz, Sheikh Ghassan Manasra and other Interfaith clergy, with each discussing paths to international peace initiatives. Dr. George Love will lead his unique blend of traditional Qigong with wholistic healing movement. Keynote speaker and leading oceanographer, John Englander will address the existential climate crisis, based on his best-selling books, \"High Tide on Main Street\", and \"Seeking Higher Ground\". Lunch will offer a ceremonial vegetarian meal, called Langar, presented by the Sikh Society of South Florida. The afternoon program will feature a Multi-Cultural Encounter Workshop with Sheikh Ghassan Manasra, International Director of Abrahamic Reunion. This nonprofit agency works \"on the ground\" in the Holy Land creating friendship and dialogue between Muslims, Christians and Jews. An \"All-In Drum Circle\" and various guided meditation venues will be available throughout the day. The final highlight of the Embracing Peace Day will be the dedication of a new \"Peace Pole\" on the St. Andrews Episcopal Church campus followed by a meditative, musical Christian Taize service in the sanctuary. Ticket proceeds will be donated to two nonprofits, Abrahamic Reunion, and Community Greening, a local charity planting trees while establishing community roots.
