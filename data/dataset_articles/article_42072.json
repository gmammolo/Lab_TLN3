  "text": "Twitter changed its name to X and some things seem to get better but there is nothing in this world that will ever beat old-school Twitter Hashtag games and we found one that was that kind of old-school funny. We legitimately laughed out loud, full belly laughs and a snort. We hope you do as well. To read about the story that inspired the tag you can click [here](https://twitchy.com/brettt/2024/04/17/biden-tells-steelworkers-his-cannibals-story-again-n2395211). Let's Go! [#RIPUncleBosey](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RIPUncleBosey&src=typed_query) We think this hashtag started with a simple comment to someone talking about the insane story. [April 17, 2024] It went on from there and it is GLORIOUS! This is why they have to script everything he does. When they set him free, he goes off telling old man stories.— Don'tBeAJagoff (@Eponine1973) [#RIPUncleBosey] [April 17, 2024] She's not wrong. Being a known plagiarist and liar, he tends to 'embellish' things, and the legacy media likes to ignore that. Joe's uncle died feeding the hungry.— ʞɹıɯ𝕊 (@FoundersGirl) [#RIPUncleBosey] [April 18, 2024] Like any good Leftist, Uncle Bosey was a giver! Previously unknown picture of Uncle Bosey released.— TheMorningSpew2 (@TheMorningSpew2) [#RIPUncleBosey] [pic.twitter.com/ZY2somQeBy] [April 18, 2024] Bwahahaha! He seemed to be so happy before the big meal. Sorry Uncle Bosey, need to tenderize you a little first.— #Nats Fan Carla (@LibertyBelleCJL) [#RIPUncleBosey] [pic.twitter.com/HMINzFMeba] [April 18, 2024] STOP IT! Stop it right now. We should not be laughing this much. In our defense, Uncle Bosey did not get eaten by cannibals. He did die, which is sad, but he was not eaten by cannibals. Popular Irish dishes in Papua New Guinea include:— Fuzzy Chimp 🇺🇸 (@fuzzychimpcom) - Bosey and Mash - Shepherd’s Thigh - Corned Bosey - Bread Pudding Brain - Bosxty [#RIPUncleBosey] [April 18, 2024] Recommended Ok, but we do not see Bosey BBQ Beef Jerkey on that list, and beef jerky is a camping staple.:) — Jodi (@APLMom) [#RIPUncleBosey] [https://t.co/wSJr7GF4i9] [pic.twitter.com/uAAd4bU4Hr] [April 18, 2024] Oh good grief, even if you were a Biden supporter you have to admit that hashtag is hilarious! Found a picture of the cannibal who ate Uncle Bosey.— Artist_Angie: Sensei of Sarcasm (@Artist_Angie) IYKYK [#TheWalkingDead] [#RIPUncleBosey] [pic.twitter.com/3Ulgf4hShx] [April 18, 2024] [April 18, 2024] I heard he was served with fava beans and a nice Chianti.— Mark The Shark (@MRaff57) [#RIPUncleBosey] [pic.twitter.com/2z8O2WkQe1] [April 18, 2024] Are there any Walking Dead fans out there? We are sorry for including our own tweet, but it made us laugh and had some good replies. But did the natives have a nice Chianti?— Grateful Calvin (@shoveitjack) [#RIPUncleBosey] [https://t.co/I7tBtAn21y] [pic.twitter.com/lFK6EJVlFH] [April 18, 2024] Our bet is yes. haha — David in Dallas, Texas 🙏🇮🇱 (@David_in_Dallas) [#RIPUncleBosey] \"I Eat Cannibals\" by Toto Coelo (1983) [pic.twitter.com/aKw5dKyckD] [April 18, 2024] Oooh always nice to add music to a good meal. Good thing Uncle Bosey was a pilot and not a clown - or else he would have tasted funny.— (((𝖑𝖎𝖘𝖘𝖆))) (@lissa77) [#RIPUncleBosey] [April 18, 2024] — Lizzy Lou Who 🌷 (@_wintergirl93) [#RIPUncleBosey] [pic.twitter.com/5Al17Lv6fy] [April 18, 2024] *SNORT* There are reports that Uncle Bosey choked on a piece of Corn Pop.— TheMorningSpew2 (@TheMorningSpew2) [#RIPUncleBosey] [April 18, 2024] We love that another Joe Biden lie was incorporated. PERFECTION! In keeping with Joe Biden's example of leadership and how to be a good person, we lied in that cover image. WE ARE LAUGHING and we hope you are too!
