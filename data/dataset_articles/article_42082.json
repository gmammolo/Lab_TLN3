  "text": "TAHLEQUAH, Okla. — The Cherokee Nation honored three Veterans with the Medal of Patriotism during the Council of the Cherokee Nation's April meeting. Christopher Huitt and Luke Brown were recognized by Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr., Deputy Chief Bryan Warner and Secretary of Veteran Affairs S. Joe Crittenden. Navy Veteran Daniel Brown was posthumously honored by the tribe. The Cherokee Nation says they recognize Cherokee service men and women for their sacrifices as a way to show the high regard in which all Veterans are held by the tribe. \"It's been an honor, this really touches me deep,\" Huitt said. \"I'm honored by our people and it's an honor that I've made our people proud.\" The Cherokee Nation says that Native Americans, including Cherokees, are thought to have more citizens serving per capita than any other ethnic group. \"Thank you all for being here and honoring us today,\" Luke Brown said. \"It's an honor to be able to stand in the ranks with everyone else.\" Daniel and Luke's mother, Tanya Brown, received the award on his behalf. \"I'm the Cherokee of the family and I just appreciate you honoring my offspring and inviting us to come and honoring us in this way,\" she said.
