  "text": "Entertainment TV Ray Romano Says Starring on Everbody Loves Raymond with Peter Boyle Was 'Surreal': 'He Made Me Feel Welcome' (Exclusive) Romano reflects on the late actor who died in 2006 from multiple myeloma and heart disease By JP Mangalindan JP Mangalindan JP Mangalindan is a Senior Writer for TV at PEOPLE. He joined PEOPLE in May 2023. JP's work has previously appeared in Insider, Fortune, Teen People, and Entertainment Weekly. People Editorial Guidelines Published on April 18, 2024 05:01PM EDT Close Peter Boyle and Ray Romano at the 57th annual Primetime Emmy Awards in West Hollywood, California in 2005. Photo: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic When Ray Romano reflects on his time working with Peter Boyle on Everybody Loves Raymond, it’s with an incredible sense of fondness and reverence. During a recent interview with PEOPLE, Romano, 66, discussed his early days with his former costar, who died on December 12, 2006 at 71 from multiple myeloma and heart disease. Romano hosted The International Myeloma Foundation Gala on Thursday, April 18, which benefits the Peter Boyle Research Fund and advances in myeloma research. At the time Everybody Loves Raymond premiered in September 1996, Boyle was already an accomplished actor with a long list of credits to his name, including his breakout role in 1970’s Joe, the 1974 comedy Young Frankenstein directed by Mel Brooks and the 1989 comedy thriller The Dream Team. “When I met him, he, of course, was a well-known movie actor, star, and I was nobody. I was a stand-up who got his own sitcom and was trying acting,” Romano recalls of Boyle, adding, “I was very intimidated and he took me in. He made me feel welcome. He made me feel part of the club.” 'Everybody Loves Raymond' Cast: Where Are They Now? 'Everybody Loves Raymond' stars Doris Roberts, Peter Boyle, Sawyer Sweeten, Ray Romano, Sullivan Sweeten, Brad Garrett, Patricia Heaton and Madylin Sweeten. On the first day of rehearsals for the CBS sitcom, Boyle noticed how “nervous” Romano was and stopped the comic to offer some advice. “[Peter] said this one quote, and there was no segues or anything. He just stopped me as I was walking, and he said, ‘It's just like water. Just let it flow,’” Romano shares. “In the first season, I rented an apartment, because my family stayed in New York and his family stayed in New York, and we coincidentally were in the same apartment complex,” he continued, adding that the two would hang out, rehearse and grab dinner. Patricia Heaton Remembers Mentor and 'Everybody Loves Raymond' Co-Star Doris Roberts Everybody Loves Raymond ran from 1996 to 2005 for nine seasons, with a cast that included Romano, Boyle, Patricia Heaton, Brad Garrett and Doris Roberts. The show would go on to win 15 Emmys, including outstanding comedy series, outstanding lead actress in a comedy series for Heaton, outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series for Garrett and outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series for Roberts. Boyle, meanwhile, received seven Emmy nominations for his grouchy portrayal of Frank Barone. When the actor auditioned for Everybody Loves Raymond in 1996, Boyle's consternation over arriving late actually worked in his favor and helped him land the role. 'Everybody Loves Raymond' stars Brad Garrett, Ray Romano, Doris Roberts, Patricia Heaton and Peter Boyle. CBS “I was ready to pop,” Boyle later told PEOPLE in 1999. “I didn’t plan it that way, but I was just like Frank when I walked in.” But Boyle couldn’t have been more different from his character in real life, his wife Loraine told PEOPLE that same year, describing the actor as \"very intellectual.\" “He can talk about anything from philosophy to politics to history,\" she said. \"With Frank, his character, you get the feeling that he’s mainly interested in the next slice of pizza.” Romano, for his part, now tells PEOPLE that his time on and off-camera with the actor as something of a dream. “It was as surreal as it could be,” he shares. “I'm doing stand-up one day, and the next day, I'm on my own show and Peter Boyle is my buddy.” Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.
