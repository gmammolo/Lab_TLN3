Visitors walk along a tail at Joshua Tree National Park. The park will offer free admission on Saturday, April 20, 2024. (Photo by Watchara Phomicinda, The Press-Enterprise/SCNG) By Marla Jo Fisher | Orange County Register 4:26 4:29 p.m. Do you like the Great Outdoors?\nFor the kickoff of the annual National Park Week, which for 2024 will be held April 20-28, the park service is offering free admission to its parks and monuments on Saturday, April 20.\nThis can save you $50 or even more, but here’s what you need to know, from someone who’s taken advantage of it in the past.\nShow up at dawn. Seriously. I know, I know. Don’t hurt me. But then you get there before the thundering hordes arrive. As you might guess, free passes are a huge draw.\nYou don’t need to sign up or register. Just show up and go.\nTourists stop to gaze at the spectacular Yosemite Valley from the national park’s Tunnel View lookout. Yosemite National Park will offer free admission on Saturday, April 20. (Photo by Getty Images) Here are the nine national parks in California: Channel Islands (the boat ride won’t be free), Death Valley, Joshua Tree, Kings Canyon, Lassen, Pinnacles, Redwood, Sequoia, Yosemite. You can also drive to Zion National Park in Utah — one of my faves — in about eight hours.\nPersonally, I suggest Joshua Tree National Park, which is my favorite local place. I even bought a place there. Here’s how I do it:\nGet on the road before dawn with snacks, sandwiches, water, a swimsuit and a towel. Watch the pink sun rise over Mt. San Jacinto, which is a truly beautiful sight. At this hour, there won’t be any traffic, so you should make it to the west park entrance in 90 minutes or so, depending obviously on where you start.\nHead directly to the Wonderland of Rocks area from the town of Joshua Tree where there are several interesting trails. That’s my favorite part of the park. Alternately, you could keep driving to 29 Palms, and visit the park headquarters where there’s also a trail. We typically hike around until the crowds arrive around 11 a.m. Then we leave, stopping in town for early lunch, and head to Desert Hot Springs and buy a cheap day pass for the pools at the Desert Hot Springs Hotel & Spa. Yeah, it’s very ’70s and less than fancy. But the hot water feels great. You can also get a massage if you’ve booked it in advance.\nRelated Articles Things to Do | Movie review: ‘Don’t Tell Mom the Babysitter’s Dead’ a surprisingly fun remake Things to Do | How to make Michael Twitty’s matzoh ball gumbo, a soup of Black and Jewish cuisines Things to Do | What the ‘Fallout’ show gets right about the post-apocalyptic video game series Things to Do | Recipe: Artichokes are in season.

Maybe April 20 is your day. Just be aware that there will still be snow up there, so dress warmly and check for road closures.\nNote that there will be special national park events all week long, so take a look online to see what’s available. And enjoy!\nLearn more: nps.gov\n ",
