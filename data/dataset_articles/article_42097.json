  "text": "Goodwill in Mason opens to the public MASON, Mich. (WILX) - On Thursday, the Mason Area Chamber of Commerce held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new Mason Goodwill Community Open House. The goal of the Goodwill is to serve as a hub for community engagement, support and be an amazing community resource. The Goodwill will take in donations from the community and provide affordable clothing and recourses to low income families. They also hope to provide new jobs to the area and help people become more financially self-sufficient. “I think we live in a time where we don’t understand poverty levels,” said Sharla Horton, the Mason Area Chamber of Commerce Executive Director. “And I think items that come into Goodwill are at a price point that people can afford things for their home clothing, for their children, those kinds of things. So I think it’s just a good service for those people that don’t make a lot of money but can still have something nice to take home to, to sit on, to eat off from, to wear those kinds of things.” The Mason Goodwill is open till 8 p.m. six days a week and until 6 p.m. on Sunday.
