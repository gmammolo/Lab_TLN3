  "text": "[Community Corner](/california/sanramon/around-town) San Ramon Students Place First At Destination Imagination Tournament A group of students are headed to the global tournaments after placing first in regional and states for the project-based competition. SAN RAMON, CA — A group of seven San Ramon students are advancing to the global competition for Destination Imagination, a project-based program teaching kids to be innovative problem solvers. The group placed first in both regional and state-level competitions, and will attend the global competition in Kansas City in May. The team needed to solve a series of seven challenges leading up to science-themed final competition. They needed to create and present the details of an archaeological investigation that leads to the discovery of an artifact, and design and build a puppet. The team’s winning creation was a life-size puppet of Leonardo da Vinci that moved its arms with hydraulics. [Last May](https://patch.com/california/sanramon/san-ramon-students-headed-destination-imagination-global-tournament), a team of 8th graders from Gale Ranch and Windemere Ranch middle schools also headed to the global competition in Kansas City after placing first in a regional competition and second in a state competition. The team, deemed “Dill Pickles,” explored issues of inflation and climate change through a rearranged fairy tale. Find out what's happening in San Ramonwith free, real-time updates from Patch.
