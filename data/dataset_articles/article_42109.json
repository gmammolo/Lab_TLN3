  "text": "If you recently purchased a lottery ticket in Arizona, you may want to check your numbers now as one lucky winner matched enough numbers in Wednesday's (April 17) Powerball drawing to win a $1 million prize. The lucky Powerball ticket sold in the Grand Canyon State was the only one in the country that won anything during Wednesday night's drawing, scoring $1 million after matching five of the numbers called, according to the Powerball website . If you think you may have purchased the ticket, now's the time to check to see if you won. These are the lucky numbers that helped the to-be-determined winner score their huge prize: Numbers: 24 - 29 - 44 - 47 - 54 Powerball: 2 Power Play: 2x Because no tickets managed to match all six numbers during Wednesday's drawing, the jackpot has risen to an estimated $98 million ahead of the drawing on Saturday (April 20). Once the prize is claimed, the winner will join the list of other lucky players who have scored incredible, life-changing sums thanks to a lottery ticket and will be able to use their prize to fulfill the wildest dreams, from taking a long-awaited vacation to buying a new house.",
