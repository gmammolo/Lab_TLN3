  "text": " UVA first baseman Henry Ford is having a tremendous freshman season.\nThe Charlottesville native is part of one of the country’s most potent offenses: Ford is batting .371 with 13 home runs. He has 49 RBI and 47 runs scored, both ranking second on the team. Ford has 56 hits, third most for Virginia.\n“I had high expectations for myself and I believe in myself,” Ford said. “I’ve put in a lot of work to have this success.”\nFord grew up a big UVA Baseball fan: His uncle played baseball at Virginia, and he attended games at Disharoon Park. Ford’s dad played baseball at William & Mary.\nYoung Ford began making a name for himself in Charlottesville’s McIntire Little League, hitting three home runs in one game. UVA Coach Brian O’Connor took notice of Ford then as a 12-year old.\n“He not only hit them [home runs] right handed, he’d go up there and hit them left handed, too,” O’Connor said. “It was pretty amazing at that level what that young man was able to do.”\nFord played his first two years of high school baseball at St. Anne’s-Belfield School. UVA offered him a scholarship when he was only 15, a chance he jumped at taking.\n“No brainer, I didn’t think they would offer me that quick,” Ford said.\nHe played an elite level of high school baseball his junior and senior seasons at the Baylor School in Tennessee.\n“By the time he was a junior in high school, you could really see he was going to be a difference maker,” Coach O’Connor said.\nFord’s freshman season was highlighted by him hitting three home runs in a single game against North Carolina, first time he had hit three homers in a game since little league.\n“He’s a phenomenal competitor, great teammate, and great person,” O’Connor said. “Incredibly serious about his craft and puts everything into it. He has made a huge difference in this year’s lineup.”\n“It’s a dream come true,” Ford said about playing for UVA. “It’s everything I could have hoped for and more. Everybody cares about each other, nobody is about themselves. It’s all about the team. When you have that it’s really something special.”.\n ",
