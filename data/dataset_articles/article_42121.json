  "text": "Following the outcome of the Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, members of the PDP Integrity Group, popularly known as the G-5, were seen celebrating on Thursday.\nIn a jubilant mood were the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Nyesom Wike, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, former governors Samuel Ortom, Okezie Ikpeazu, and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State, all gathered in Abuja to mark the successful conclusion of the party’s NEC meeting.\nThe PDP convened its 98th NEC meeting, which was well-attended by key party figures at its National Headquarters in Abuja on Thursday.\nThe National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP gave a vote of confidence in the party’s Acting National Chairman, Umar Iliya Damagum, as confirmed by the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, in a statement.\nPrior to Damagum’s appointment, Iyorchia Ayu served as the acting National Chairman of the PDP until his removal during the lead-up to the 2023 presidential elections.\nDue to Damagum’s perceived alignment with Wike’s faction, the celebration among the G-5 governors was particularly spirited.\nVideo footage from the event can be viewed below.\nWike, Makinde, other G5 members celebrate in Abuja after PDP’s NEC meeting pic.twitter.com/fGkJPyjgDQ\n— Journalist KC (@kc_journalist) April 18, 2024",
