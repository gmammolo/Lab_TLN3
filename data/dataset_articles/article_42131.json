  "text": "Non-monetary incentives are one of the best ways to motivate employees. If you want to improve employee engagement, motivation, and productivity, look no further. Using non-monetary incentives saves companies time and resources while boosting satisfaction in a personal way. To get the most out of your incentives, listen to employee feedback regularly to ensure the incentives are meaningful enough to be effective.\nIf you’re looking to refresh your employee\nperks and benefits on a budget, keep reading to explore non-monetary incentive examples and best practices.\nThe benefits of non-monetary incentives\nOrganizations and managers often want to recognize and reward employees but don’t have the funds to give out frequent monetary rewards, like bonuses. That’s where non-monetary incentives come in. Offering employees extra time, benefits, appreciation, and development opportunities shows you recognize their achievements—without breaking the bank.\nPersonalizing incentives can also make them more meaningful to employees, which is great for engagement and motivation. Here are some common benefits of non-monetary incentives for employees:\n- Less expensive than monetary rewards\n- No tax implications\n- Easy to personalize for individuals and teams\n- Boost employee well-being\n- Improve employee engagement and retention\n- Improve company productivity and performance\n- More options\nThe downsides of non-monetary incentives\nAs with anything else, there can be downsides to using non-monetary employee incentives. Although the benefits surely outweigh the downsides, here they are:\n- Some teams might be more motivated by money\n- Employers need effective employee feedback channels to personalize appropriate incentives\n- Require more intentionality and time\nIdeas for non-monetary incentives\nNon-monetary incentives are the way to go if you are trying to incentivize employees and improve engagement. Ask for employee feedback regularly to get the most out of your incentives. Understanding employee values and priorities is critical to finding the most effective non-monetary incentives.\n1. Personal work time\nEmployees are motivated by what they are passionate about. To boost employee appreciation, offer time to work on personal passion projects. Ask people what they care about and let them spend time exploring those areas. Chances are, those passions overlap with company values and can be used to promote current business goals. It’s a win-win for employees and organizations alike.\n2. Paid time off (PTO)\nHave you ever heard the saying ‘work hard, play hard’? It has some weight to it. Employees work harder during business hours when they have time to turn their brains off. Offering time to relax, go on vacation, and spend time with family or friends gives employees something to look forward to and reduces burnout.\n3. Healthcare benefits\nEmployees appreciate healthcare benefits, and companies should, too. Offering comprehensive benefits like telemedicine services, mental health support, family medical insurance, and fitness stipends keeps people healthy and productive, reducing sick and mental health days. Additionally, this non-monetary incentive can boost retention and recruitment since most people value investments in their health.\nLearn more:\nEmployee Health and Well-Being\n4. Life insurance\nSimilarly to healthcare benefits, life insurance incentivizes employees. Whether it’s an individual or family plan, life insurance offers employees security, peace of mind, and convenience. Adding it to an overall compensation and benefits package makes your company more attractive to job seekers and boosts retention by demonstrating that you care about the well-being of your employees and their families.\n5. Experiences\nToday, most people value experiences more than material items. This societal shift means employees value opportunities to make memories and meaningful new connections. Experiences could include a spa day, a paid vacation, a trip to an amusement park, or a comedy show voucher. Ask employees what kinds of experiences they enjoy and offer those. That way, the experiences have the greatest impact.\n6. Public recognition\nRecognition is a big part of employee appreciation, motivation, and self-confidence. Offering public recognition is a great place to start to incentivize your employees. Not only does public recognition make top performers feel proud, but it also motivates others to perform at that level. It’s the perfect way for leadership to demonstrate what a top performer looks like and what someone can receive once they get there.\nLearn more:\nEmployee Recognition\n7. Employee discounts\nEmployee discounts on products and services are another great non-monetary incentive. Again, asking employees about their values is crucial to knowing what incentives will be most effective. If you know that many employees love Sweetgreen salads or Orange Theory workout classes, try to find discounts there. Bonus points if you can find a current business partner to offer discounts for your employees.\n8. Professional development\nOne of the most effective non-monetary incentives for employees is professional development. It’s effective because employees see it as an investment in themselves and their future. Plus, it helps companies maintain growth and innovation on a budget. Options include mentorship programs, study groups, job rotations, webinars, conferences, and continuing education. The more you offer, the more future leaders you have.\n9. Flexible work arrangements\nWorkplace flexibility is huge right now, and it’s sticking around because employees find great value in it. Letting people work from wherever they are most comfortable and productive boosts employee well-being and, in some cases, reduces overhead costs. Incentivizing workplace flexibility also benefits recruitment since most job seekers value work-life balance and well-being.\n11. Personalized gifts\nWhen a gift is personalized, it means a lot. Consider your employees’ values here, too, and brainstorm what kinds of gifts they would appreciate. Personalized tech accessories, plants, subscription boxes, gift baskets, or experiences are all great options. No matter your choice, send a note or thank your employees in person to make the incentive meaningful.\n12. Recreational team activities\nLike experiences, recreational team activities are a fun way to connect your team and build memories. These activities can be as simple as joining a local sports league together or as involved as an all-day, company-wide tournament. Recreational team-building activities can be competitive or leisurely, whatever your employees prefer.\nIncentivize your team with Top Workplaces recognition\nRewarding, people-first culture is one of the most powerful incentives. The Top Workplaces program recognizes employers who intentionally use employee feedback to drive shared success- and celebrates the faces behind the success.\nNominate your organization today to incentivize employees with industry-leading recognition!",
