  "text": "Need to get rid of those Bradford pear branches? Give it to elephants at the Knoxville Zoo Now that April is here, spring cleaning seems to be in full swing across Knoxville. Yard sales are popping up, and Home Depot and Lowes are being frequented, likely for household project supplies. It's also a time when many choose to give their lawns a sprucing. But what about all the leftover yard trimmings? [Zoo Knoxville's Browse Donations program](https://www.facebook.com/zooknoxville/posts/pfbid02bsNCoULdbgQmL64DqCWbqegL3tqnYd3kXef4pu43dU67bar4xdyiNFkg1cWBaGxHl?__cft__[0]=AZUWx0j71gLEKZ-OUzIhxHoHq4SSuNNL1dSR7LE1EovTomiMozDopCkSD4C--aoWByvZkk3Ff3Ys9OOJJ3FZIRMwqh-BJsA9A9LJh3YUOIvrcGBuG_YYP94rL5WjZA7Y0pIRzpK4QL0ncBMknc8GAo7Lg6-ooz_zK7ddVoas5oYaOUnGaGRutp_Sv9sGUbe6c-2vBBHln0h9B55yL2KZ65yf&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R) offers a win-win solution. In the wild, giraffes and elephants typically feed on tree branches, also called browse, said lead zookeeper Petty Grieves, who oversees Zoo Knoxville's Grasslands and Asian Trek exhibits. Browse donations from the community can help the zoo replicate this. The zoo uses browse quickly, so there is a frequent need, said J.J. Jones, Zoo Knoxville's media manager. \"We regularly ask for donations from the community, because as you can imagine, an elephant eats a lot.\"While the animals don't rely solely on donated browse for nutrients, it is a food they enjoy eating. \"We make sure they have a very balanced diet, but their favorite thing are branches,\" Grieves said. Among their favorites are the much-maligned Bradford pear, the invasive [Callery pear trees that bloom in spring and give off a stinky fish smell](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2024/03/14/why-bradford-pear-trees-smell-bad-and-how-and-why-to-get-rid-of-them/72934322007/). \"Our elephant Tonka and our giraffes love to eat browse and bark,\" said Jones. In addition to providing nourishment, eating browse also serves as a form of enrichment for the animals, Jones told us. What kind of browse can be donated? The species and treatment of the browse matters, but the shape it's in is less important. It's important to the zoo that they don't feed their animals any vegetation that could potentially be toxic, Grieves said. The giraffes and elephants' favorite types of browse are the following, according to Zoo Knoxville's [website](https://zooknoxville.org/browse-donations/): - Bradford pear - Sugar maple - Silver maple - Mulberry - Chestnut oak - White oak - Hickory - Eastern redbud - River birch - Box elder - Elm - Hackberry - Honeysuckle (Not in berry, because they're toxic) - Mimosa - Grapevine - Willow - Tulip poplar The zoo also asks that donors \"ensure that any browse has NOT been sprayed with any chemicals or pesticides.\" Any browse that meets the above guidelines is likely to be a good fit for the zoo, even if it no longer has leaves. Branches without leaves are part of these creatures' diets too, according to Grieves: \"They'll strip the bark, and if the branches are thin enough, they'll chew that up and eat that as well.\" How can browse donations be made? Zoo Knoxville asks that donors call or email before dropping browse off to ensure the zoo is expecting the donation. The zoo does not offer pick up, according to its website. To let the zoo know about a browse donation, call (865) 637-5331, ext. 1280, or email [pgrieve@zooknoxville.org](mailto:pgrieve@zooknoxville.org). Hayden Dunbar is the storyteller reporter.
