  "text": "Originally published January 21st, 2026 9:49 p.m.\nUpdated January 22nd, 2026 4:13 a.m.\n(KNSI) — Authorities say the seven-year-old Zimmerman girl whose disappearance triggered an AMBER Alert Wednesday night has been found safe, and a suspect is in custody.\nBrynlee Nelson got on her school bus on Wednesday afternoon, but didn’t return home. Fellow bus riders confirmed that Brynlee was on the bus, and police reported there was a black car seen following it, but didn’t know if she got in the car or not.\nThe Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension sent out an update around 1:20 Thursday morning saying Brynlee was safe and someone was in custody. The circumstances around her disappearance and where she was found were not released.\n___\nCopyright © 2026 Leighton Media. All rights reserved.
