  "text": "[Community Corner](/florida/stpete/around-town) ‘Au Naturel’ St. Pete Yard Named A Certified Wildlife Habitat A St. Pete artist and writer has been recognized by the National Wildlife Federation for turning her yard into a safe space for FL wildlife. ST. PETERSBURG, FL — A St. Petersburg writer and artist has been recognized by the National Wildlife Federation for transforming her yard into a welcoming and safe space for wildlife. For years, Kathy LaFollett has worked to turn her yard into a sustainable green space that supports birds, butterflies, frogs and other Florida wildlife. Now, her Winston Park home — not far from Sawgrass Park and Weedon Island — has been awarded the Certified Wildlife Habitat designation through the National Wildlife Foundation’s Garden for Wildlife movement. Find out what's happening in St. Petewith free, real-time updates from Patch. “It was a cool thing to happen. I’ve been working through the last seven years on this kind of a thing,” LaFollett told Patch. The artist has long been drawn to wildlife and the outdoors. She recalls growing up in an Illinois farm town and loving being surrounded by nature and animals. And at 9 years old, she had a beloved pet parakeet. Find out what's happening in St. Petewith free, real-time updates from Patch. This changed her life, as she’s spent her life since then surrounded by animals, especially parrots and other birds. She even ran a website dedicated to parrots and has written several books of musings on birds and wildlife. This is why the Sunshine State was the perfect place for LaFollett and her husband to land. They first moved to Clearwater in 1999 and later, came to St. Petersburg. “I love Florida. I love the animals. I love everything in St. Pete,” she said. When she first moved to St. Petersburg, she knew she wanted to create an artsy safe haven for all kinds of creatures. “I wanted to paint murals on every wall in every room and I wanted to create that space where wildlife knew they were safe,” LaFollett said. She even dubbed her home the LaFollett B&B Rest Stop for animals, which later became the topic of a book. She befriended a crow, who she named Edward, and later the bird’s wife, who she named Helen. They had a child named Jack. “And Jack became a book,” she said. “Jack is my bud. He still comes and visits.” She also has a group of Muscovy ducks that often sleep on her porch. Everything about her yard has been informed by the needs of local animals, she added. “I let the wildlife dictate to me what was going on. We’re just the caretakers.” The flowers and other plants on her property are “as native as possible,” LaFollett said. She also doesn’t use pesticides and incorporates other sustainable practices, like conserving water. Now with a sign in her yard proudly declaring it a Certified Wildlife Habitat, she hopes to lead by example in her neighborhood. “I get to be the pied piper of being au naturel,” she said. LaFollett said that no matter the size of the property or space — even a tiny apartment — “it’s as simple as a heart attack to create a sustainable space that draws local wildlife and insects. “Food, water, protection, a place to nest. That’s all you need,” she said. “If you have all those things and you don’t use pesticides, you don’t use fertilizer, you stay au naturale, you’re in.” She added, “You don’t have to do an entire property like me, because I’m a mad woman and I’m unemployed. You can just do a couple of pots, planters on the patio, a bird feeder, a bird bath, give a good home to a toad, and you’re in. It’s so small, but so important.” Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
