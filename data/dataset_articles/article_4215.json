  "text": "Kejriwal was arrested on March 21, 2024 by the ED in connection with the broader excise policy-linked money-laundering probe. Source : IANS Delhi’s Rouse Avenue Court has granted relief to Aam Aadmi Party national convenor and former Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, acquitting him in cases linked to the alleged non-compliance of Enforcement Directorate (ED) summons. The matter was connected to the ED’s money-laundering probe in the alleged Delhi excise policy case. Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Paras Dalal pronounced the order, holding that the allegations over the summons did not constitute a criminal offence. The verdict comes amid continuing legal scrutiny of the excise policy controversy.\nFour Summons Allegedly Ignored The ED had approached the court claiming Kejriwal intentionally failed to comply with summons issued to join the agency’s investigation into a money-laundering case. According to the agency, four summons were issued between November 2023 and January 2024 and were not honoured.\nThe dates of the summons, as per the ED’s submissions, were November 2, 2023, December 21, 2023, January 3, 2024, and January 18, 2024. The agency alleged Kejriwal deliberately avoided appearing despite repeated notices.\nKejriwal, however, maintained that the summons were illegal and refused to participate in the questioning. Based on the alleged defiance, the ED filed two criminal complaints against him. The court has now ruled in Kejriwal’s favour in these matters.\nArrest, Bail & The Supreme Court Twist Kejriwal was arrested on March 21, 2024 by the ED in connection with the broader excise policy-linked money-laundering probe. On 20 June 2024, Rouse Avenue Court’s vacation judge Niyay Bindu granted him bail.\nHowever, after the ED challenged the order, the Delhi High Court stayed the bail, keeping the case in sharp public and political focus. In July 2024, the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Kejriwal and referred his plea challenging arrest to a larger Bench for consideration.\nWhat ED Alleges In The Case The ED claims the new Delhi excise policy was implemented as part of an alleged conspiracy that benefited select private players, including allowing 12% profit in wholesale liquor trade. The agency has argued the condition was not recorded in the formal minutes of meetings of the ministers’ group.\nIt also alleges the coordination involved Vijay Nair and others with the “South Group”, claiming Nair acted on behalf of Kejriwal and then Deputy CM Manish Sisodia.\nRelated Video Breaking News: Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann Claims 10 Lakh Health Coverage Under Free Healthcare Scheme",
