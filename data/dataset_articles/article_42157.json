Every year, the YWCA of Greater Atlanta inducts a new class into its Academy of Women of Achievement — plus an overall Woman of Achievement.\nBut this year, it did not disclose the woman who would receive the top recognition before the event because it wanted it to be a surprise.\nThe YWCA-Atlanta on April 18 held its annual luncheon at the Marriott Marquis. The surprise honoree was Phillis Wheatley, who was born in around 1753 in Gambia, Africa. She was captured and enslaved in 1761, then she was sold to the Wheatley family in Boston. The Wheatley family educated her, and soon she could read the Bible, Greek, Latin and British literature. She also studied astronomy, geography and began writing poems. She died at the age of 31.\nBut her legacy lives on.\nSaluting the YWCA’s 2024 Academy of Women Achievers at the Marriott Marquis. (Photo by Maria Saporta.) The Atlanta YWCA is planning to reopen the Phillis Wheatley YWCA on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard sometime next year. The Wheatley Y has been dormant since 2015.\n“We are more than halfway to our $19.5 million goal,” said Danita Knight, president and CEO of the YWCA of Greater Atlanta, at the event.\nAccepting the award was an actress who played the role of Phillis Wheatley.\nThe 2024 members of the Academy were:\nPaige Alexander, president and CEO of the Carter Center Deisha Barnett, president of global communications for UPS Julia Houston, chief strategy and marketing officer for Equifax Kaye Husbands Fealings, an assistant director of the National Science Foundation and former dean of Georgia Tech’s Ivan Allen College Chanel Frazier, head of BlackRock Atlanta Ayesha Khanna, managing director of CARE Enterprises Lauren Koontz, president and CEO of the YMCA of Metro Atlanta Gina Espinosa-Meltzer, CEO of Hope Beckham Espinosa Maya Penn, CEO of Maya’s Ideas April Ross, executive director of the Georgia Commission on Family Violence During the lunch, an appeal was made to attendees to fund various programs of the YWCA. More than $125,000 was raised at the event.\n— Maria Saporta\n“WCLK At 50” celebration begins with “Great Day in Atlanta” photo\nPhoto by Prime Phocus/Donna Permell.

(Photo by Maria Saporta.) It was a bit like coming home when Truist CEO Bill Rogers came to speak to the Rotary Club of Atlanta on April 15.\nRogers used to live and work in Atlanta when he was CEO of SunTrust. But when SunTrust merged with BB&T of North Carolina, Rogers moved to the combined bank’s new corporate headquarters in Charlotte.\nBut it was clear many people still view Rogers as a fellow Atlantan given his reception at Rotary, where he was questioned by Katie Saez, Truist’s regional president for Truist.\nThe two discussed purpose, with Rogers saying his personal purpose “is taking care of my corner” and making sure his “corner is better because I was there.”\nRogers also said that “the real magic happens” when personal purpose intersects with business purpose.\nSaez asked Rogers about how he views downtown Atlanta, which will be hosting the College Football Playoff National Championship in 2025 and the FIFA World Cup in 2026, both at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.\n“Atlanta has all the physical assets that every city would want — hotel rooms, Mercedes-Benz Stadium…,” Rogers said. “The challenge will be how do we bring all that together, how do we have Atlanta be the live, work and play” community that is inclusive with a high quality of life.\nFor starters, Rogers said it’s important for people to get back to work in their offices.\n“You have to work downtown and get back to work in the office. We are committed to doing that. We want our people to be physically present,” Rogers said, adding that Georgia is still the largest business base for the bank — with 8,000 employees — despite being headquartered in Charlotte.\nWhen it comes to philanthropic contributions, Saez said that at the time of the merger in 2019, the new bank pledged to double its respective investments in both individual institutions over the next three years.\n“Not only did we meet that, but we exceeded that,” Saez said.\n— Maria Saporta\nISB Atlanta and Mayor Dickens mark Eid\nDignitaries gather at the Mayor’s Eid event on April 16 with Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens standing next to Soumaya Khalifa, founder of the Islamic Speakers Bureau of Atlanta.

At its annual Power to Inspire fundraising event, the National Center for Civil and Human Rights used theater and entertainment to enlighten attendees about the importance of the landmark Brown v.

This year Atlanta Jazz Festival audiences will be greeted by the festival’s new voice, Carl Anthony. He’ll host the free festival in Piedmont Park over Memorial Day Weekend, May 25 to 27.\n“Carl has been a friend and supporter of the Atlanta Jazz Festival for more than 30 years,” said Camille Russel Love, Executive Director of the City of Atlanta – Mayor’s Office of Cultural Affairs. “His extensive experience as an on-air host and his wealth of knowledge about jazz make him the ideal person to be the voice of the Atlanta Jazz Festival. We look forward to officially welcoming him to the family this year in Piedmont Park.”\nThe city shares that music has always been a big part of Carl’s life. He grew up in a household filled with jazz and Broadway soundtracks. During the Sixties he was listening to music emerging from Detroit, Philadelphia, Muscle Shoals, New York, and London, much of it driven by romance and the counterculture that birthed protest songs influenced by the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement.\n— Derek Prall\nJudy Adler named director of GEFA’s Water Resources Division\nGeorgia Environmental Finance Authority (GEFA) Executive Director Hunter Hill announced that Judy Adler has been selected as the new Water Resources Division director, effective April 16.\nGEFA’s Water Resources Division supports the development of water, wastewater, and solid waste infrastructure projects, which help protect the environment, facilitate economic development, accommodate population growth and safeguard public health.\nPrior to joining GEFA, Adler served as vice president, head of global sustainability for Gap Inc., a global company including the Athleta, Banana Republic, Gap and Old Navy brands.
