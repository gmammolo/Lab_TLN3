  "text": "The [Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) at Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/olli/) recently received its largest individual member gift ever, from longtime member Robert Lang. This is the largest single gift beyond the originating endowments received from The Bernard Osher Foundation in 2007. OLLI at SBU is one of 125 Osher Institutes in the United States, all made possible by generous grants and endowments from The Bernard Osher Foundation. Lang, who passed away in 2022, was an OLLI member for five years and named the OLLI program as a beneficiary of his retirement plan. OLLI at SBU is a volunteer-based program that offers noncredit workshops, lectures, social events and day trips designed to appeal to those 50+ years of age. According to Liz Wilson, interim director of OLLI, it’s designed to promote and support lifelong learning through programming of interest. Members are encouraged to join committees to help lead the program. “We currently have more than 750 active volunteer members,” Wilson said. “The OLLI curriculum is developed and curated by OLLI members for OLLI members.” “It’s because of thoughtful and engaged members like Bob that the OLLI program is so successful,” said Peter Diplock, vice provost for continuing, professional, and executive education. “He was an important member of OLLI, and we are grateful for his support, which will help ensure that the program will continue to thrive in the future.” Diplock said Lang’s gift will be impactful in providing scholarships and broadening membership access to new members who may not have the resources to join. In addition, the funds will help support OLLI community events that promote and celebrate a culture of intergenerational and lifelong learning.
