  "text": "Brittany Cartwright didn’t stay down after receiving a bit of criticism over her body. The Valley star had a confident comeback for online trolls after facing shameful remarks about her body. \"Babe those b*obs are too big,\" an Instagram critic commented on Brittany's April 17 post. \"They make you heavier than you even are.\" The Vanderpump Rules alum didn’t hold back, and had just the right reply for the hater. \"Could you imagine me going on your page and commenting on your body?\" the 35-year-old replied. \"Yes my boobs are big, cool.\" The Bravolebrity showed off her latest fashion moment, showcasing her curve-hugging strapless corset dress and beautiful makeup look in the post. Brittany hasn’t shied away from being open about her plastic surgery journey, and even shared her breast augmentation on the fourth season of Vanderpump Rules. Jax Taylor, her then-boyfriend and now estranged husband, was the one who convinced her for the b*objob. \"It's not just for you, it's for me,\" he said in the February 2016 episode. \"Who doesn't love big b*obs?\" Other than this, the star has had liposuction and Morpheus8 treatment, which is a procedure to boost collagen production.
