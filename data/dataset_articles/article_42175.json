  "text": "As the mercury rises, it's essential to adapt our skincare routines to keep our skin healthy, glowing, and protected from the harsh summer elements.\nDeepika Padukone, renowned for her flawless complexion shares her simple yet effective skincare tips to breeze through the summer months with enviable radiance!\nLet&apos;s delve into the leggy beauty of Bollywood&apos;s expert skincare advice that&apos;s super effective in summer.\nHydration the Skin\nDeepika emphasizes the importance of staying hydrated from within. She starts her day with a tall glass of water to replenish moisture lost during sleep. Additionally, she suggests consuming water-rich fruits and vegetables like watermelon, cucumber, and oranges to keep the skin hydrated and plump from the inside out.\nAdequate hydration helps maintain the skin&apos;s elasticity, preventing it from becoming dry and dull under the sun&apos;s scorching rays.\nSun Protection is Compulsory\nShielding the skin from harmful UV rays is paramount for Deepika. She advocates for wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF every day, even when indoors or on cloudy days. Reapplication every two hours, especially if you&apos;re spending extended periods outdoors, is crucial.\nDeepika also stresses the importance of using sunscreen on all exposed areas, including the neck, ears, and hands, It prevents premature ageing and reduces the risk of skin cancer.\nCleanse the Face, Twice a Day\nDeepika believes in the power of a gentle yet thorough cleansing routine. She recommends cleansing the face twice daily, once in the morning and again before bedtime, to remove sweat, dirt, and impurities that accumulate throughout the day.\nOpting for a mild, non-stripping cleanser helps maintain the skin&apos;s natural moisture barrier without causing dryness or irritation, leaving it feeling fresh and rejuvenated.\nExfoliate Wisely\nExfoliation is a vital step in Deepika&apos;s skincare regimen, especially during the summer when dead skin cells can accumulate more rapidly. However, she advises against over-exfoliating, which can strip the skin of its natural oils and exacerbate sensitivity, particularly in hot weather.\nInstead, she suggests using a gentle exfoliant two to three times a week to slough off dead skin cells, unclog pores, and promote cell turnover, revealing a smoother, more radiant complexion underneath.\nOpt for Breathable Skincare Products\nDuring the summer months, Deepika opts for lightweight skincare products that won&apos;t feel heavy or greasy on the skin. She prefers oil-free moisturizers and serums infused with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid and glycerin to provide ample moisture without clogging pores or causing breakouts.\nAdditionally, she recommends using a refreshing facial mist throughout the day to instantly hydrate and revive the skin, especially when it&apos;s feeling parched from the heat.\nKeep it Cool and Refreshed\nLast but not least, Deepika emphasizes the importance of keeping cool and refreshed during the sweltering summer days. She enjoys indulging in DIY cooling face masks made from ingredients like yoghurt, cucumber, and aloe vera to soothe and hydrate the skin while providing a refreshing sensation.\nThe Pathan movie star suggests storing skincare products like moisturizers and eye creams in the fridge for an extra cooling boost that helps reduce puffiness and inflammation, leaving the skin feeling revitalized and invigorated.\nDeepika Padukone&apos;s skincare tips offer a holistic approach to summer skincare, focusing on hydration, sun protection, gentle cleansing, exfoliation, lightweight formulations, and staying cool and refreshed. By incorporating these expert recommendations into your daily routine, you can keep your skin healthy, glowing, and resilient throughout the summer months and beyond!\nImages: Instagram\nTrupti Palav Boldsky source: boldsky.com",
