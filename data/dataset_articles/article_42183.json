  "text": "[Mariska Hargitay](https://en.newsner.com/tag/mariska-hargitay/) has played a police officer on television for the past 25 years, but recently she found herself playing one in real life too when a lost child approached her thinking she was a real officer. The actress and mother of three paused filming for roughly 20 minutes while she helped the child locate their mother. A witness told [People](https://people.com/mariska-hargitay-mistaken-for-real-life-police-officer-by-young-girl-on-svu-set-8634829) that a young girl had become separated from her mother at the Anne Loftus Playground in Fort Tryon Park on April 10. The girl, appearing oblivious to Hargitay’s scene partner, Ice-T and the film crew, approached Hargitay and asked for help. Hargitay then paused production for 20 minutes while she helped the little girl look for her mother. Thankfully, the two were able to reunite in less than a half hour. Hargitay has played Olivia Benson on Law and Order: SVU since the series premiere in 1999. The show is currently in its 25th season. It looks like all those years of playing a police officer on TV paid off! Thanks to Mariska for helping the young girl find her mother.
