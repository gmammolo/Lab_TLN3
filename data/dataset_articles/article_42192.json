  "text": "Taylor Swift is beloved by her devoted clan of fans for many reasons other than just her music. Miss Americana is known and loved by her fans for the smart clues she leaves in her outfits, music videos , Instagram posts and even nail polish colors. These clues, or Easter eggs, point to what the pop star might be working on or planning to do next. And with a new Taylor Swift album on the way this weekend, Swift's social media accounts have been active and have her fans hunting for Easter eggs. One recent theory places the spotlight on Florida. Here's a quick guide to how Swift drops Easter eggs for her projects and why Swifties think Florida might be the epicenter of her next big announcement, whatever that may be. First, what are 'Easter eggs' and why is Taylor Swift associated with them? What if we told you she's a Mastermind? But seriously, Swift is known for hiding well-placed clues in her songs, promotional messages and even her outfits and nail polish, for fans to uncover and guess what she could be doing next. Taylor herself told The Washington Post in 2022, \"When I was 15 and putting together my first album, I decided to encode the lyrics with hidden messages using capital letters. That's how it started, and my fans and I have since descended into color coding, numerology, word searches, elaborate hints, and Easter eggs.\" Here are some examples of her best Easter eggs: - 13 - As her lucky number (born on Dec. 13, 1989), you'll not only spot it in music videos or in her posts but fans have found 13-second intros at the start of her songs or 13 capitalized letters in an Instagram post that lead to a larger clue. - Snakes - Fueled by Kim Kardashian calling her a \"snake,\" Swift has included the imagery for her Reputation album and used the symbol when hinting at her past feuds. - \"Nils Sjoberg\" - In the \"Look What You Made Me Do\" music video, she is next a grave of Nils Sjoberg. It's the fake name Taylor used while working on ex Calvin Harris and Rihanna's song, \"This Is What You Came For.\" - \"Not a lot going on at the moment\" - Her post in April 2020 seemed to poke fun at the pandemic at the time but really, she was working on two of her albums \"Folklore\" and \"Evermore,\" which released later that year. - The Summer I Turned Pretty - Did you know she actually announced her album \"Midnights\" way before the MTV Music Awards? In a post about Amazon Prime's The Summer I Turned Pretty using her new song, she specifically says it will come out at \"m i d n i g h t.\" Why do fans think Taylor Swift is leaving hints about Florida before album release? There was a globe set up at a Spotify event for Taylor's new album and this TikTok creator (@swiftiesweetheart) pointed out that there was a pin in the globe, placed on Florida. \"I think this globe just revealed everything...\" she said in the TikTok video. She pointed out that there is a song on the track list for Taylor's new album titled \"Florida!!!\" Taylor is also known for playing around with numbers and fake error codes on her website. On the night that she announced her new album at the Grammys, her website went black and had an error code up that read \"Error 321 backend fetch failed.\" There was also a massive QR code put up in Chicago, as promotion for her album, that led anyone who scanned it to another \"Error 321\" message in the form of a short video on Taylor's YouTube account. This creator and some other Swifties are theorizing that the \"321\" sequence could be a nod to a Florida area code, as it's an area code for the Orlando area. Think this is a stretch? It's probably one of the most simple Swiftie theories yet. What is 'The Tortured Poet's Department' song 'Florida!!!' about? While there’s no confirmation on what “Florida!!!” is about, fans have taken to social media with their theories. Fans theorize that \"Florida!!!\" is about her Eras Tour shows at Raymond James Stadium from April 13 to 15, 2023 — which would have been when details of Swift and Joe Alwyn, her boyfriend of six years, break up were made public, according to People . Since the track list was revealed, fans looked back at moments from the Tampa shows and noticed the popstar seemed upset when performing songs about her past relationship. Who is 'Florence + the Machine' featuring on 'Florida!!!' track? Florence Welch is the powerhouse lead vocalist for the English indie rock band \"Florence + the Machine.\" Welch is known for several hits over the past decade, such as 2009's \"Dog Days are Over,\" 2011's \"Shake it Out\" and 2015's \"Sweet Nothings\" collaboration with Calvin Harris. \"Florida!!!\" is the first time Swift and Welch have collaborated on a song together. See the entire 'The Tortured Poet's Department' track list - \"Fortnight (feat. Post Malone)\" - \"The Tortured Poets Department\" - \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\" - \"Down Bad\" - \"So Long, London\" - \"But Daddy I Love Him\" - \"Fresh Out the Slammer\" - \"Florida!!!\" (feat. Florence + The Machine) - \"Guilty as Sin?\" - \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" - \"I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)\" - \"loml\" - \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart\" - \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" - \"The Alchemy\" - \"Clara Bow\" - Bonus Track: \"The Manuscript\" There are also three different variants that come with a different album cover and bonus track — The Bolter edition, The Albatross edition and The Black Dog edition. ‘Tortured Poet’s Department’ almost here Here’s where Florida Swifties can find it When does 'The Tortured Poets Department' come out? When can I stream Taylor Swift's new album? After receiving her 13th Grammy, Swift announced her new album “Tortured Poets Department” would come out Friday, April 19. The album also will be available to stream on most streaming platform, such as Apple Music and Spotify , on that date.",
