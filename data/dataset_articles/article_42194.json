  "text": "> CUBA — The Allegany County Democrats collected 12 bags/boxes of non-perishable food and personal care items when they met recently in Cuba.\nThe goods were donated to the food pantry operated by the Cuba Council of Churches: Our Lady of Angels Roman Catholic Church, Christ Episcopal Church, First Baptist Church, Cuba United Methodist Church, and North Park Wesleyan Church.\n“It always warms the heart and stirs the soul to see the people of our community step up to take care of the poor,” said Pastor Jon Ward of North Park Wesleyan. “Our food pantry is for the residents of the Cuba part of the Cuba-Rushford School District. We assist people with food in difficult times as well as gas vouchers for medical trips or job interviews, lodging in emergency situations, and a massive Holiday Assistance Program each year at Christmas”.\nThe pantry is located at the First Baptist Church, 17 South St., and is open by appointment. Call (585) 968-2347 (North Park Wesleyan Church’s office) for more information or to schedule an appointment.\nJoin the county Democrats on May 11 in Little Genesee for coffee and to support that community’s local food pantry. For details email info@alleganycountydemocrats.org , (585) 610-4321 or find the group on Facebook.",
