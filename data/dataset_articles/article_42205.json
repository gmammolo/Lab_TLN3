  "text": "| | Getting your Downtown San Mateo is about to get a whole lot squishier. The downtown association is hosting a Boba Day celebration April 28, featuring samples, sales and specials from 16 boba and boba-adjacent downtown businesses. And the spherical theme doesn’t stop there – free activities like Zorb ball racing, bubbles and balloon animals will overtake B Street from noon to 3 p.m. Present proof of a boba purchase to the Downtown San Mateo Association booth and you’ll receive a prize, such as a reusable metal boba straw, “Boba On Board” stickers and downtown San Mateo drink koozies. Vote for your favorite downtown San Mateo boba shop and you’ll be entered to win a boba plushie from Fanloli Beauty. “I’m really excited to shine a light on the local businesses,” said Mackenzie Jakoubek, Downtown San Mateo Association executive director. “I’m also just really excited for people to come to downtown San Mateo who maybe haven’t been here before or even people who haven’t tried boba before, maybe going out of their comfort zone and giving it a try.” Find offers at local shops, including 50% of all boba drinks at Bambu Dessert Drinks, buy-one-get-one-free for orange milk tea and orange passion fruit tea at TP Tea, a complementary 24 oz organic black milk tea with boba with a purchase of any beverage at Bobabia and more. “A lot of them are offering samples, so I’m going to sneak off and try some that I have not tried before,” Jakoubek said. Boba Day is presented by Downtown San Mateo and CAM Edu, with support from the City of San Mateo, San Mateo Age Friendly Coalition, BobaOnBoard.com, Fanloli Beauty, Youth Advisory Council Generation Voter, San Mateo Parks and Recreation and San Mateo Area Chamber of Commerce. “If you’re on the fence, I will remind you that San Mateo has free parking on Sundays,” Jakoubek said. “It’ll just be a fun social day to come out in San Mateo.” For more information on Boba Day, visit [dsma.org](https://dsma.org/event/boba-day-2024/).",
