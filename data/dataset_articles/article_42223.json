  "text": "Street ministry is one of my favorite things to do. There is something refreshing about meeting people from all walks of life in an outdoor setting and telling them about Jesus’ love for them.\nOne beautiful summer day, I met a young mother who was walking to a store with her small children. Her face showed signs of stress, yet her children seemed joyful as they ran and skipped in the gorgeous weather. As she neared the store, I stopped her and asked if I could pray for her. With great relief, she said with a sigh, “How did you know I needed prayer and someone to talk to today?” In response, I said, “God knew that you needed the prayer, and I am happy to be the one to pray for you.”\nAs the birds chirped and soared through the breezy air, she began to share her hardships with me as her children hugged my legs and giggled. With a smile, I shared with her the difficulties I faced in life and how God saved me before helping me to overcome those challenges. As I asked her to join me in taking a seat on the nearby chairs, I held her hand and hugged her children in my other arm. I began praying for her and tears fell from her eyes. I then asked her to repeat the words of a prayer for salvation. To my great delight, her small children also repeated the prayer with pure and innocent voices.\nLuke 15:7 (CSB) says, “I tell you, in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than ninety-nine righteous people who don't need repentance.”\nThere is rejoicing in heaven when the people we share Christ with receive Him as their Lord and Savior. I imagine one of the most exciting celebrations happening at that moment! What a pleasure to participate in setting up heaven for a joyful celebration.\nJust as we rejoice when we find something valuable that we have lost, God the Father rejoices as well. The Bible shares a parable about a lost son coming home and the father celebrated by throwing a party. The father said, “But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.” (Luke 15:32)\nMaybe street ministry is not a desire for you. That is completely understandable. Might there be people you encounter in your daily life that you can share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with? A neighbor, a friend, or a fellow grocery store shopper may come to your mind. There may be someone that you encounter who will not attend a church service or watch a Christian program. You may be the person they need to hear from to receive God’s gift of salvation. As Matthew 5:14 shares, “You are the light of the world. A city situated on a hill cannot be hidden.”\nPray for the courage to begin sharing the love of God with those in your daily life. You were created to be the light of the world.\nLet us pray: Dear Lord, I want to share Your love with others. Please give me the boldness to reach out to the lost people in my life so they receive the gift of Jesus Christ. I want them to experience Your love through me. In Jesus’ name, amen.\n~\nScripture is quoted from the Christian Standard Bible. Copyright © 2017 by Holman Bible Publishers. Used by permission.
