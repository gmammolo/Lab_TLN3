  "text": "Photo: GC Images\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit star Mariska Hargitay was mistaken for a real cop while filming an episode of the show in New York City on April 10. Hargitay has been playing Detective Olivia Benson on the show for the past 25 years, the longest run of any character on a prime-time drama series.\nDuring a break in filming, a young girl wandered onto the set at Anne Loftus Playground in Fort Tryon Park and walked right up to Hargitay , ignoring the film crew and her scene partner Ice-T .\nThe girl believed that Hargitay was an actual police officer and asked her for help finding her mother.\nAccording to TMZ , Hargitay didn't miss a beat and immediately began to help the girl . Filming was held up for about 20 minutes as the cast and crew searched the park for the girl's mother, who was relieved when the two were reunited.\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit was recently green-lit for a 26th season, extending its reign as the longest-running prime-time drama series of all time.\nPhoto: GC Images",
