  "text": "The victorious rowing team of Asian International School (AIS) received a grand felicitation from the school Principal and the Sports Department following their outstanding National Championship performance at the 39th National Rowing Championship organized by the Sri Lanka Amateur Rowing Association.\nThe AIS men’s team asserted their dominance at the 39th National Championship held at the Diyawanna Rowing Centre in Battaramulla, emerging as the men’s junior national champions. Coached by Sanjeewa Guruge, the AIS rowers clinched an impressive tally of 10 gold medals, six silver medals, and two bronze medals.\nAmong the standout performers was co-captain Shaylon Gunaratna, who secured triple gold medals and claimed the coveted Schoolboy Sculler Shield. Gunaratna’s impressive achievement added to the glory of the AIS team, highlighting their dominance on the national stage.\nUnder the leadership of Principal Harshana Perera and the Sports Department headed by Nihara Bagoos, the AIS sports team displayed exceptional teamwork and dedication, clinching the Junior National Men’s Championship title. The AIS team triumphed over leading rowing schools in Colombo, including Royal College, S Thomas’ College, and St Joseph’s College, among others.\nAIS holds the distinction of being the pioneer international school to introduce rowing in Sri Lanka, and their commitment to the sport has borne fruit with the production of numerous national-level players. Notably, four AIS rowers – Shaylon Gunaratna, Shivendra Goonewardene, Venuk Panduwawala, and Rovinya Wijesekera – represent the Sri Lankan national rowing squad.\nFurthermore, three AIS rowers – Luqman Rizmeer, Dayan Haleemdeen, and Joel Weerasinghe – contribute to Sri Lanka’s Youth Development Programme, while two players – Sonal Tranchell and Shayden Gunaratna – are included in the Sri Lanka Development Squad.",
