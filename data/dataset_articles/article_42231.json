  "text": "2024-04-18 10:00:00\nLamis Mohammed\nThursday April 18, 2024 12:00\nThe international actress spoke\nMelissa Barrera On being kicked out of Scream, she revealed she felt “alone and scared” after what happened in November 2023 when she was kicked out of Sam Carpenter’s role in the Scream movie , which she used to participate in, because of what she wrote about Instagram’s support for Palestine.\nThis led fans to pledge to boycott Scream VII, with many calling for other cast members to stay away from the project in solidarity.\nBarrera said of the premiere: “The reactions I received were beautiful and completely unexpected, especially since I didn’t know what the reaction would be, but after seeing the love and support from the fans, people who understand that it’s bigger than just a movie, and that’s what’s happening. “It’s not just a movie, it’s something deeper and bigger, and I am very grateful for that.”\nBarrera went on to say, “You attract those kinds of people with the energy you put into it. There’s something that draws you to them, and seeing the support from fans of the show [Scream], I felt validated. “It was beautiful in that moment when I felt so alone, so scared and in a dark place, to feel like they had my back was beautiful.”\nLast January, Barrera told Rolling Stone magazine that she was “at peace” with the situation and continued: “I think everything that happened was very transparent, on both sides, and I know who I am, and I know what I’m doing.” I’ve always said, comes from a place of love, a place of humanity and a place of rights. “Man and a place of peace,” she emphasized, saying, “Freedom is for the people, which should not be controversial. “\nShe concluded her speech by saying: “This should not be up for discussion, so I am very at peace. People who know me from my family know who I am and where I stand, and I think most people in the\nworld know that. this too.\n1713475245\n#Melissa #Barrera #scared #fired #movie #Scream #Gaza #audience #supported\nRelated posts:\nUlm's Historic Triumph: Austrian Duo Leads Basketball Team to German Championship The Canadian in New Brunswick: an arena rises from its ashes The Impact of Coffee on Cholesterol Levels: Insights from Scientific Studies | Pixabay Practices that worsen varicose veins [[콕!건강]If you are diabetic...
