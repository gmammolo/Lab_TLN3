  "text": "By JOSH WORMANN Staff Reporter ,\n20 hours ago Senator for the John Martinson Honors College, Lynlee Rice, discussed Purdue Student Governments donation of $9338 to Purdue’s Southwest Asian and North African Student Union. Daniel Pike | Staff Photographer The Purdue Student Government approved a bill to donate $9338 to Purdue’s Southwest Asian and North African Student Union to create a cultural center at their Wednesday night meeting.\n“In order to get the cultural center, they need about $15 million,” Senator for the Honors College Lynlee Rice said. “So it is kind of a drop in the bucket, but every bit that they get helps.”\nRice said the money projected is an estimate of how much it will cost to build a new stand-alone building.\nShe said even if the organization renovated an existing building, the costs would still be significant.\nRice also said that SWANA faces more obstacles in creating a cultural center because Southwest Asian and North Africans are not officially recognized on the United States demographic survey\n“In order to get cultural centers, they have to approach the university with the money first,” Rice said. “Then the university will help them start figuring out how to put it in action.”\nThe approval of this bill will donate the remainder of the “president initiatives” portion of the PSG budget to SWANA. Treasurer Seth Thompson said the money currently in the budget will not carry over to the student government’s budget next year.\n“We should spend it while we have it, because I don't know if anyone has any plans for the next three weeks for $9000,” Thompson said.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
