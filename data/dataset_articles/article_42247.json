  "text": "Barbra Streisand does not mince words. The\nEGOT winner has been vocal about her political views for many years and particularly critical of former president Donald Trump. Amid his bid to return to the position, Trump has been embroiled in multiple legal proceedings, giving his critics plenty to use as reasons for why he should not be reelected. During his first criminal trial, Streisand took to X, formally known as Twitter, to give her thoughts on the matter.\n“Trump is like a broken record endlessly repeating his lies, that he is the victim of a ‘witch hunt,’ is ‘innocent,’ and ‘I’ve never broken the law.’ Get a grip Donald! You have been indicted in four separate jurisdictions with 91 different felony charges,” Streisand\ntweeted. Babs didn’t stop there. Hours later, she took to the platform again tweeting, “It would be wonderful if more people judged more closely the character of a President. You don’t want a vain and vindictive man who is a pathological liar and whose only goals are more money and power to prop up his fragile ego. Like Donald Trump.”\nBarbra Streisand’s Plans if Trump is Reelected\nLike many a celebrity, and like herself during Trump’s first presidential run, Streisand proclaimed in late 2023 that she intends to leave the United States if the former president returns to the White House. The entertainer did not follow through with her 2016 promise, but this time around she has somewhat of a plan. During the interview with Stephen Colbert in which she stated her intent, Streisand said she’d like to move to England if necessary.\nStreisand might not have to leave the United States. As of this writing, oddsmakers have said the likelier outcome of the 2024 presidential election is a Joe Biden victory. The margins are narrow, though, so the fate of the country, and the fate of Streisand, remains to be seen.",
