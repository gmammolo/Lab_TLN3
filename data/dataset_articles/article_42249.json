  "text": "KU’s “Gateway District Project” brings changes to historic football staduim WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - Starting in August 2025, fewer Jayhawk football fans will be able to watch the team play on their home field. Phase one of the “Gateway District Project,” which involves rebuilding the west side of David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium and adding a conference center, will decrease the number of available seats. The project, which started in December 2023, will cost $448 million and decrease the stadium’s capacity from 47,233 to approximately 40,000. [In an interview with](https://www2.kusports.com/weblogs/2024/apr/17/seating-at-kus-revamped-football-stadium-to-shrink-by-a-few-thousand-seats-other-updates-on-gateway-project/) [KUsports.com](http://kusports.com/), KU’s Athletic Director, Travis Goff, says the decrease in seating is actually a positive thing. He says all the bleacher seats on the west side will be replaced by chair-back seats, increasing comfort and offering better views for fans. Goff believes KU will find many uses besides football for the stadium and the connected conference center. The conference center will feature a large, wide-open room that could accommodate banquet-style seating for 1,000 people. KU says future phases of the project will focus on the south and east portions of the stadium, along with the entertainment, dining, and retail aspects of the Gateway District. During these phases, the stadium may see an increase in the number of seats available. Next season’s home football games will occur at Arrowhead Stadium and Children’s Mercy Park in Kansas City. Recognized as the first stadium built on a college campus west of the Mississippi River, David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium at Kansas University is the seventh oldest collegiate stadium in the nation. It opened in 1922 with a capacity of 22,000. Copyright 2024 KWCH. All rights reserved. To report a correction or typo, please email news@kwch.com",
