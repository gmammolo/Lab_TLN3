  "text": "Émile Chouinard and Jacob Newcombe win the Paul-Dumont Trophy\nApril 18, 2024 -\nQuebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) News Release\nBoucherville, QC - The QMJHL is proud to announce that Émile Chouinard of the Baie-Comeau Drakkar and Jacob Newcombe of the Cape Breton Eagles win the Paul-Dumont Trophy as personalities of the year in the league.\nIn his fourth and final season in Baie-Comeau, Chouinard collected 14 points in 45 games, with a +38 rating, seventh on the Drakkar's scoring list. Chouinard had to end his regular season on February 3 to undergo treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma. The courageous No. 15 remained with the team's entourage until his return to action in Game #3 of the first round on April 2.\nNewcombe will remember January 18, 2024 for the rest of his life. On that day, against his former team, the Chicoutimi Saguenéens, he made a comeback after battling non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a type of cancer. Scoring 24 points in 26 games, his return inspired the Eagles, who compiled the QMJHL's fourth-best record in the second half of the season en route to fourth place in the Eastern Conference.\nFor an interview with Émile Chouinard : Jordan Robert, 418 295-6377, communications@le-drakkar.com\nFor an interview with Jacob Newcombe : Brad Chandler, 902-295-0683, brad.chandler@capebretoneagles.com\nThe finalists were:\nYanick Jean, head coach, Chicoutimi Saguenéens\nOn February 23, Yanick Jean set a QMJHL record with his 590th victory as head coach. A pilot in our league since 2005 and with Chicoutimi since November 2014, Jean also led the young Saguenéens to a 35-25-4-4 record for 78 points, just five points behind Moncton and third place in the Eastern Conference. Not bad for a team that relied on eight rookies who played at least 20 games.\nJustin Poirier, forward, Baie-Comeau Drakkar\nIn his second QMJHL season, Poirier made headlines by becoming the first 17-year-old since Sidney Crosby in 2004-2005 to score 50 goals. His 51 goals earned him the first-ever Mario-Lemieux Trophy, as the league's top goal-scorer. Number 9 added 31 assists to finish seventh in the league in scoring. He is eligible for the next NHL draft.\nQuebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League Statistics\n• Discuss this story on the\nQuebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League message board...\nQuebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League Stories from April 18, 2024\nÉmile Chouinard and Jacob Newcombe win the Paul-Dumont Trophy- QMJHL Character and Compete Wanted from Ownership- Halifax Mooseheads Maxim Massé Wins the Michael-Bossy Trophy- QMJHL Change in Hockey Operations for Moncton Wildcats- Moncton Wildcats QMJHL announces finalists for the Kevin-Lowe Trophy- QMJHL\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.",
