  "text": "Gaining recognition in the Tamil movie industry demands bravery to take risks and commitment to hard work. The journey to achieving stardom in films remains a distant goal for many individuals. However, actor Sathyaraj stands out as someone who accomplished the seemingly impossible and earned a name for himself.\nThe actor-producer, who is now widely recognized, began his journey in the Tamil cinema industry with humble beginnings and faced numerous challenges. Despite the initial hardships, his film career flourished, leading him to achieve great success in subsequent years. Notably, he portrayed the iconic character of Kattappa in SS Rajamouli&apos;s Baahubali film series, alongside Prabhas.\nSathyaraj and beginnings in Tamil cinema\nSathyaraj was born in Coimbatore in the year 1954. The son of a doctor Subbiah, he completed his education in the city itself but was always a fan of cinema, especially actors MGR and Rajesh Khanna.\nDespite facing opposition from his mother, Sathyaraj ventured into the world of cinema by relocating to Kodambakkam, Chennai. He initially approached actor Sivakumar and producer Thiruppur Manian for work, later joining a drama troupe.\nHis first acting opportunity came in the film Sattam En Kaiyil alongside Kamal Haasan, where he portrayed a henchman. By 1985, he had appeared in 75 films, often in antagonist roles.\nIn 1985, he was featured in a lead role in the film Saavi, which became a massive success at the box office.\nThe famous Kattappa of Indian cinema\nActor Sathyaraj has been a part of the Indian film society for many years now. The actor over the past years has predominantly acted in Tamil cinema while also making appearances in other languages like Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, and Hindi.\nThough many loved and revered him for his iconic comedy and villainous antagonist roles, the actor catapulted to glory with the portrayal of Kattappa in the films Baahubali and Baahubali 2. Every single person in India during the period of films being made had one question in mind and wanted to know, why he killed Baahubali.\nDespite the passage of time since the answer was revealed, the character and the actor who portrayed him continue to leave a lasting impression on audiences. With a single role, the immensely skilled actor rose to fame as one of the most iconic figures in Indian cinema. Just like Prabhas and Rana Daggubati are associated with the movie, Kattappa remains etched in people&apos;s memories!\nBUZZ: Shruti Haasan and Sathyaraj to likely join Rajinikanth-Lokesh Kanagaraj&apos;s Thalaivar 171\nMeet Tamil actor who ran away from his home and became a sensation with just one role; not Rajinikanth or Kamal Haasan",
