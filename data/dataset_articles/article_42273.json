  "text": "YORK, Pa. — On Thursday York County Reentry Coalition (YCRC) opened its Reentry Opportunity Center (ROC) located at the rear of York County Prison.\nThe center will be a place for previously incarcerated individuals to seek resources in order to successfully reintegrate into society.\n“I feel like York County is a place where anyone can be successful from their second chance, the third chance, their fourth chance,” said Chawna Griffith-Meyers the executive director of the York County Reentry Coalition.\nGriffith-Meyers said that the ROC is also a place where people on work release can meet with community providers. The same organizations that use the ROC space can also work with people in the secure jail area.\nGriffith-Meyers said, “I feel like we’re putting resources into our community. Everyone deserves a chance, if we were all judged by our worst day wouldn’t we want somebody to help us?”\nJustin Craverner was formerly incarcerated but now works as a certified recovery specialist. Craverner told FOX43 that he struggled with substance abuse and addiction but was able to turn his life around after connecting with the YCRC.\nToday, he has been in recovery for five years and seven months.\n“Eventually, it became finally true. I’m able to go inside the jail as a person in recovery and be able to meet other guys and give them some hope that they can recover too,” Cravener said.\nFor more information on the Reentry Opportunity Center, click here .",
