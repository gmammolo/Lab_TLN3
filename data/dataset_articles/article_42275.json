  "text": "Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen publicly thanked ex-teammate Stefon Diggs on Thursday, and revealed he sent a text message to the wide receiver. “Yeah, I shared a text with him and got one back, just thanking him for everything that he did for me,” Allen told reporters Thursday's in his first public comments since the Bills traded Diggs . “I’ll always have a spot in my heart for him and I’ll always love him like a brother and wish him nothing but the best.” The Bills traded Diggs to the Houston Texans earlier this month after the receiver spent four seasons in Buffalo. Diggs’ tenure in upstate New York was eventful. Diggs led the NFL in receptions and receiving yards in 2020, he had four consecutive seasons with more than 100 receptions and had four straight invitations to the Pro Bowl. However, there were times when Diggs’ frustration boiled over on the sideline at Allen and other teammates. The wideout missed the first day of mandatory minicamp in 2023 and he’s made cryptic comments on social media. Diggs’ production dipped midway through 2023. He finished the season with 11 straight regular-season games with less than 100 receiving yards and had just 73 combined receiving yards in Buffalo’s two playoff games last season. The Bills subsequently traded the star wideout to Houston after Diggs’ time in Buffalo appeared to have run its course at the conclusion of the 2023 season. “My lasting memory of (Stefon) will be the receiver that helped me become the quarterback that I am today,” Allen said. “I will always thank him for that.” Allen’s two Pro Bowl selections (2020 and 2022) came with Diggs as his leading receiver. Diggs’ departure created a massive hole at wide receiver in Buffalo. In addition to trading away Diggs, the Bills also lost their No. 2 wide receiver, Gabe Davis , to the Jacksonville Jaguars in free agency.
