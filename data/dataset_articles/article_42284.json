  "text": "HOPKINS, Minn. — Working in education is\n[a calling for a lot of people.](/article/news/local/land-of-10000-stories/teacher-knits-hats-for-her-entire-albany-kindergarten-class-based-on-her-students-designs/89-d46de284-9ea7-4df2-995b-f6ce2008fcf8)\nIt might go without saying, but teachers don't get into the industry to get rich, at least not in the monetary sense. The riches come from the lives they touch — and change.\nEleven teachers in Minnesota are finalists for Teacher of the Year in high school, elementary and even kindergarten classrooms.\nYes, kindergarten.\nSo, how does one get the nod as perhaps the best in the state by teaching 5- and 6-year-olds?\nKARE 11's Breaking the News anchor, Jana Shortal, went to Alice Smith Elementary in Hopkins to find out.\n\"My people\"\nWhen the line shuffles into this classroom every morning, all of them know this is where they want to be.\nIt took Ellen Wu exactly one year of teaching sixth grade to figure out she was actually a kindergarten teacher.\n\"Why are you a kindergarten teacher?\" asked Shortal.\n\"Because they are my people,\" Wu said with a laugh, adding, \"They are hilarious; they show up as themselves and we get to play, grow and learn together every single day.\"\nThis state-recognized class also reveals something else Miss Wu does as a part of her curriculum.\n\"I love her smiles and I love how she dances with us when we do brain breaks,\" said student Sasha.\n\"She's really good at it,\" said student Cora.\nWu is setting the foundation for the kids' educational career. She shows them how to sit still, how to take turns — and how to be right alongside her.\n\"What makes a teacher good?\" asked Shortal.\n\"I know!\" a student said excitedly. \"She hangs out with her children and likes to teach them.\"\n\"They go from not knowing how to line up, not knowing how to hold a pencil to becoming readers, writers and mathematicians,\" said Wu.\nBittersweet goodbyes\nApproaching the end of this school year and inevitably moving on from Miss Wu, the teacher and her students agree: The future is bittersweet.\nAs Wu said, they are her people, and after visiting with the class, Jana ultimately learned, Wu is theirs, too.\n\"Who is the most favorite teacher you've ever had?\" asked Shortal.\nIn unison and with no hesitation, the kids answered, \"Miss Wu!\"\nThe annual awards ceremony will be held May 5 in St. Paul.\nWATCH MORE ON KARE 11+\n[Download the free KARE 11+ app](/article/about-us/kare-11-news-free-and-on-demand-on-roku-and-fire-tv/89-5efa72e4-8993-4449-8eb4-dea4a1d22873) for Roku, Fire TV, Apple TV and other smart TV platforms to watch more from KARE 11 anytime!
