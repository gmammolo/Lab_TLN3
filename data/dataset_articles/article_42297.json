  "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — For local teachers have been awarded for their hard work, courtesy of a Jacksonville philanthropist. The [Gladys Prior Career Teaching Award](https://www.unf.edu/coehs/scholarships/gladys-prior-award-winners.html#:~:text=The%20Gladys%20Prior%20Awards%20for%20Career%20Teaching%20Excellence%20are%20among,Ortega%20Elementary%20School%2C%20Gladys%20Prior.) bestows $15,000 for each teacher. The 2024 award winners are John E. Ford Pre K-8 School teacher Susan Morgan; Lake Lucina Elementary School teacher Jesica Pearce, LaVilla School of The Arts teacher Kristi St. John and Loretto Elementary School teacher Ilyssa Tomlinson. The quartet have more than 90 years of combined teaching experience, the university said in a press release. “The UNF College of Education and Human Services is honored to manage the Gladys Prior Career Teaching Awards and have a part in honoring educators who are making a significant impact in our community,” said UNF COEHS Interim Dean Jennifer Kane. “We are very appreciative of Gilchrist Berg for his continued commitment to recognize and award our local educators.\" The Gladys Prior Awards for Career Teaching Excellence were established in 1998 by Berg, founder and president of [Water Street Capital](https://wscapital.com/), to honor teachers with lifelong careers in education. The past 26 years, Berg has given more than $2 million to honor Jacksonville teachers. The award is named after Berg’s fourth-grade teacher at Ortega Elementary School, Gladys Prior. UNF’s COEHS manages the gift and arranges the annual surprise award for each teacher at their school surrounded by students, faculty and staff, according to the university.",
