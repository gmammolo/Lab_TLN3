  "text": "(Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)\nThe Los Angeles Lakers were able to keep their season alive recently by taking down the New Orleans Pelicans in the Play-In Tournament, which resulted in LeBron James and company advancing to the first round of the NBA playoffs to take on the defending champion Denver Nuggets.\nWith the Lakers keeping their season alive, the storied franchise has a chance to pull off a massive upset over Nikola Jokic’s team in the first round and potentially make a deep run or win what would be an NBA-record 18th title.\nHowever, if the Lakers flame out in the first round, which is expected considering the team they’ll face starting this weekend in Denver, the offseason will be interesting in Los Angeles as there’s no telling what the franchise will do.\nJames could leave the team in NBA free agency, but the team could also make a blockbuster trade to convince him to stay, with Trae Young of the Atlanta Hawks being the most likely target.\nColin Cowherd of FOX Sports believes Young will be the next star to land in Los Angeles because his partnership with Dejounte Murray in Atlanta simply isn’t working, and a change is needed, via “The Herd with Colin Cowherd.”\n“Trae Young, my guess, is coming to L.A,” Cowherd said.\n\"Trae Young, my guess, is coming to LA.\"\n— @ColinCowherd pic.twitter.com/EmXltTY2q7\n— Herd w/Colin Cowherd (@TheHerd) April 18, 2024\nAlthough a lot can happen between now and when the Lakers’ offseason officially starts, Young heading to Los Angeles in a blockbuster trade makes a lot of sense, with the team needing another star and his representation being Klutch Sports.\nOnly time will tell what happens in Los Angeles, but it’s safe to assume there will be a major change this summer.",
