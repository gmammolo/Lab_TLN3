  "text": "Hawaii Secures $700 Million⁤ Settlement from Drugmakers over Plavix Blood thinner Honolulu, HI ⁢ – Hawaii has reached a landmark $700 million settlement with pharmaceutical giants Bristol Myers⁤ Squibb​ and Sanofi,‌ resolving a⁤ lawsuit alleging deceptive marketing practices related ⁣to the blood thinner Plavix (clopidogrel). The settlement, announced by Governor Josh Green, marks⁣ a meaningful victory for the state and its residents [[1]] .\nPlavix, initially approved by the Food and Drug ⁤Management⁣ (FDA)‌ in 1997, ⁢is a platelet aggregation inhibitor prescribed to ‌prevent stroke and myocardial‌ infarction⁢ in high-risk patients. Though,the drug’s effectiveness relies on ⁤its activation by​ liver enzymes,specifically the cytochrome 2C19 enzyme. Genetic variations considerably impact the levels of⁢ this enzyme, ⁣with individuals of East Asian or‌ Pacific‍ Islander ethnicity often exhibiting lower levels [[1]] .\nThe lawsuit, filed in 2014 by the Hawaii Attorney General, centered on allegations ​that ⁤Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi were aware of the risk of reduced drug efficacy in certain populations⁣ years before⁢ the FDA mandated a⁢ boxed warning on the drug’s‍ labeling.The state argued that the⁣ companies continued⁣ to ​market Plavix as safe and‌ effective for all patients, despite‌ knowing its potentially diminished effectiveness for “poor metabolizers” with specific ‌genetic variants [[3]] . ​\nSpecifically, the Attorney General’s office stated that 834,012 prescriptions for⁤ Plavix were dispensed in Hawaii prior to the‍ implementation of the FDA’s boxed warning [[4]] .\nIn 2010, the ⁤FDA required Plavix labeling to include⁤ a boxed warning detailing the reduced effectiveness ⁣in individuals of East Asian⁣ or Pacific islander descent [[3]] .\nduring court ​proceedings, the Hawaii First Circuit Court⁤ determined that the manufacturers could have proactively sought labeling modifications through the​ FDA’s “changes ‌being effected” process.The court found both defendants equally responsible, ​initially assessing a civil penalty of $417,006,000 against each for the deceptiveness claim and $41,000,000 against each for the unfairness claim, totaling $834,012,000 [[4]] .\nthe final settlement, reached on ⁢May 9, 2025, allocates $350 million to each defendant,‍ bringing the total settlement to $700 million [[1]] , [[2]] . The funds will be used to ⁢address the harm ‌caused to Hawaii residents who were prescribed Plavix and may have experienced suboptimal treatment due ⁣to their genetic⁢ makeup.",
