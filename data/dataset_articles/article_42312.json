  "text": "Brooklyn is a 4-month-old German shepherd puppy who started her journey from an unwanted litter, surrendered along with her siblings. She is a playful and energetic pup who enjoys exploring the world around her. She shows promise on leash walks and is eager to learn. Brooklyn should do well with other dogs, but it is unknown if she would welcome a feline friend. Although not yet house trained, with patience and consistency, she’s sure to become a beloved companion in no time. She is current on vaccinations and will be spayed prior to adoption.\nKlaus is an adult lionhead rabbit who has been patiently waiting for his forever home for more than 200 days at the shelter. Klaus’s journey began when he was found as a stray, huddled under a car with another lionhead by a compassionate passerby. Despite his uncertain past, Klaus has proven to be a friendly and easy-to-handle companion. He’s particularly fond of the older kids who visit for critter socializing, showcasing his gentle nature. Klaus is litter box trained, making him an ideal addition to any loving family ready to give him the care and attention he deserves. He is current on his vaccinations and will be neutered prior to adoption.\n baseball stars of the week: April 25 edition 5 high school 'Relief Dells Parkway construction slated for five phases from 2026-28 Boys and Girls Clubs in Portage, Baraboo have new CEO ATV/UTV 5 high school girls track and field stars: April 24 edition Waupun's Body of missing Iowa trucker David Schultz found near site where his semi was found in November 5 high school girls track and field stars: May 1 edition 2 face drug charges in Dodge County For more information and to view all of the adoptable animals, visit saukhumane.org or call 608-356-2520.
