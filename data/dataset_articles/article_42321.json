A few weeks after that, Goodnough confirmed on his Substack called [\"Hoarse Whisperings\"](https://www.hoarsewhisperings.com/) that he and Bertinelli were in a relationship. “I am Valerie Bertinelli’s boyfriend … and that may well be among the most surreal sentences I’ve ever pecked out,” he wrote. “But it’s true… and nothing about our actual relationship seems surreal. It just seems … good … lucky … a gift.” He continued by writing that “life is crazy, kids. It just is. It’ll rain hellfire down on you for years and bring you to your knees… and then it’ll open the skies to deep blue and love and calling someone ‘Honey’ because you just love the absolute hell out of her and feel so very thankful for the gift of that feeling, the gift of her.” “So, the little rumor going around,\" he added, \"consider it happily confirmed. I just adore her. I’m so glad we’re together.” Goodnough also told his readers he first asked the “Hot in Cleveland” star's permission before making his big reveal. He also joked about calling Bertinelli to ask her about the “rumors” that they were dating. “She was lovely and warm and just exactly as you would imagine; and we had a humorous conversation about this whole thing,” he wrote. “I said ‘I know this is going to sound weird but… there is apparently a rumor going around that you and I are… romantically involved. I know. Where do they get this stuff? But it was apparently in a couple gossip mags today. Not sure if you are aware or care…’” As they went back and forth, joking about the tabloids, he wrote, “She said ‘It’s true. I totally am. You’re my boyfriend.’” Goodnough also posted a photo of himself with Bertinelli’s cats. Who is Valerie Bertinelli's boyfriend, Mike Goodnough? Mike Goodnough is a writer who lives on the East Coast.
