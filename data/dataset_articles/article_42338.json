  "text": "Frank Townsend has been involved in the banking business for nearly 40 years.\nHe currently serves as the executive vice president and chief lending officer for The Southern Bank, which has a new branch in Aiken.\nTownsend cut the ribbon late Wednesday afternoon during the branch’s grand opening celebration.\n“I’m just excited to get back to being a community banker and joining a team of bankers that I’ve known for a long time,” Townsend said. “We’re thrilled to expand into the Aiken market, and we want to be the community bank of choice in Aiken.\"\nThe Southern Bank has $300 million in total assets. In addition to Aiken, there are offices/branches in South Carolina in Greenville and Spartanburg along with locations in Georgia.\n“We have a branch staff [in Aiken] of five, including me,” Townsend said. “We’re a full-service bank with the technology and online banking.”\nTownsend has been an executive with The Southern Bank since December 2021. Prior to then, he was the city executive for Aiken for SouthState Bank and also worked for other banks.\nIn recent years, “four regional banks have closed downtown [offices] in Aiken,” Townsend said. “The thought that we needed another community bank presence downtown made me want to join this bank.”\nThe Southern Bank’s Aiken branch began welcoming customers in early January at 108 Barnwell Ave. N.W. in the renovated former home of a South Carolina Electric & Gas business office.\n“We scheduled our grand opening and ribbon-cutting for our board meeting today,” Townsend said.\nThe Southern Bank’s CEO, Jamin Hujik, spoke briefly before Townsend cut the ribbon.\n“Our tagline is modern banking with a Southern accent, and when you walk into this branch, you’re going to get just that right here,” Townsend said.\nAccording to a news release, The Southern Bank opened its Spartanburg branch, which also serves as Southern Financial Corporation’s headquarters, in August of last year.\nSouthern Financial Corporation is the holding company for The Southern Bank.",
