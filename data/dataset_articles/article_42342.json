I had been on 'Married At First Sight UK', which was a stressful and intense experience, but with Kate and I ... it just happened super naturally. \"We met for coffee and met as friends, and we got on really well as friends and it developed from there, which was really nice. There was no pressure, we both just really fancied and liked each other.\" JJ has always been attracted to the former glamour model. And the 31-year-old TV star has now revealed how they first connected with each other. He shared: \"Kate actually reached out when she heard about my diabetes diagnosis, saying she was really sorry to hear this and again, this is how something good has come from it ... is Kate. She was being kind, which I appreciated and then it went from there... \"Of course, she is obviously a very, very attractive lady and I do fancy her, she's my girlfriend now ... but I have always thought she was fit.\" JJ has also insisted that he doesn't worry about their age gap. He said: \"The funny is I had messaged Kate years before, but she never opened it, which she has now found. \"With our age ... It's not even a consideration ... age doesn't matter at all; age is just a number and when you're older it's not an issue. We're both on the same page and wave length and that's all that matters.\" >> More Entertainment News © 2024 Bang Showbiz, NZCity Other Entertainment News 19 Apr: Katy Perry wants Jelly Roll to replace her on 'American Idol' 19 Apr: Taylor Swift has helped to make the Kansas City Chiefs a \"worldwide team\" 19 Apr: Kristin Cavallari and Mark Estes' romance is \"very serious\" 19 Apr: Christina Applegate was invited to join 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' a decade ago 19 Apr: Victoria Beckham is \"only just getting started\" as she prepares to celebrate her 50th birthday 19 Apr: Travis Kelce is set to host 'Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity?' 18 Apr: Cheryl Burke had three \"showmances\" during her time on 'Dancing with the Stars' Top Stories RUGBY Former Diamonds coach Lisa Alexander believes Netball Australia will welcome a proposal to include Aotearoa in their Super Netball domestic competition More...
