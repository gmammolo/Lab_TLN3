  "text": "Blake Lively has recently penned a heartwarming note for her longtime best friend and Travelling Pants co-star America Ferrera. “For everyone who knows America as a person, we watched the world simply discover America. Our friend, our role model, our ally, our sister as she soared like only she does,” wrote Lively as part of TIME’s 100 Most Influential People of 2024 essays. The Gossip Girl star stated, “That’s how she lives. How she speaks. How she challenges, and comforts. How she hurts, and heals. How she flies, and falls. How she loathes, and how she loves.” Reflecting on their 20 years of friendship, Lively said, “I've known America for 20 years exactly. Since I was 16 years old, that girl, and now woman, has been the example of what a friend is.” “What an artist is. What a human is. And I thank her. For sharing her life with me, and her talent with us all,” continued The Age of Adaline actress. Lively concluded, “God blessed America, but really, we are the blessed ones to live in the same time as her and her imprint on our world.” This is not the first time Lively paid tribute to Ferrara. Earlier in January, the Green Lantern actress shared a heartfelt Instagram post in celebration of Barbie movie. Calling Ferrara “the heart and soul of @barbiethemovie,” Lively added, “She’s the heart and soul of everything she’s a part of.” George Clooney and his wife Amal talk about Clooney Foundation for Justice mission Royal expert discusses latest King Charles condition Prince William made first public appearance since Kate Middleton's cancer news Leonardo DiCaprio has been appreciated by Zack Snyder",
