  "text": "RICHBORO, Pa. (WPVI) - A family in Pennsylvania says they have a quick-thinking Taco Bell manager to thank for saving their child’s life. Natasha Long says the situation started when her 11-week-old baby suddenly stopped breathing while she was in the drive-thru at the fast-food restaurant. “It was the scariest moment of my entire life,” Long said. The mother of two had just finished some errands and decided to grab food when she says she noticed baby Myles struggling for air in the back seat of the car. “I pulled him out and he turned completely blue and was lifeless. At that point I just completely blacked out. I didn’t know what to do,” she said. Fortunately, Long was in earshot of Taco Bell manager Becky Arbaugh, who heard the mother’s screams and quickly jumped in to give baby Myles CPR. “I ran outside and took the baby,” Arbaugh said. “I then started to do chest compressions on the baby, and he finally started to breathe.” Long said the manager appeared out of nowhere like a guardian angel. According to Arbaugh, her own scares as a mother helped her prepare for a moment like this. “When my kids were little, my daughter had similar incidents. So, I knew what she was feeling, and there was no thought in my mind that the baby wasn’t going to breathe again,” Arbaugh said. Baby Myles did regain his breath and was rushed to Saint Christopher’s Hospital for treatment. The next day Long said she called Taco Bell to thank Arbaugh, who she calls her hero. “We couldn’t be more grateful to Becky. She saved my son’s life,” Long said. Baby Myles remains in the hospital as doctors try to understand what happened to him. Meanwhile, Long has been sending videos and pictures to Arbaugh -- who now has a deep bond with the family.
