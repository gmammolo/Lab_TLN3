  "text": "This Is Carolina: Grand Strand church transforms trailer into mobile food pantry MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (WMBF) - A tight-knit group of church members is on a mission to help first responders when tragedy strikes. “We wanted to have a program that would be available to bring supplies to them or give them rest when there were catastrophes or emergencies in our county,” said Carmen Gonzalez. [The Myrtle Beach Seventh-day Adventist](https://myrtlebeachsc.adventistchurch.org/) launched [ReFresh Our Heroes](https://www.refreshourheroes.org/) in 2021 and raised money to buy a trailer, not knowing at the time that it would roll into something bigger. “We didn’t want the truck and trailer to be sitting around doing nothing,” said Chrissy Williams, the director of ReFresh Food Pantry. Williams envisioned helping more people year-round. “Mobile food pantry popped into my head over and over again. Finally, I pushed it forward and it took off,” she said. The nonprofit got to work and installed two refrigerators, two freezers and shelving before hitting the road in December 2022. “We go every month to different locations. We go to Bucksport, Finkley, Atlantic Beach, Myrtle Beach,” said Williams. “Using the heat map, we could see the need of the people all around us right underneath our eyes that didn’t know or just did not want to come out and say I need something.” Volunteers unload boxes, tables and tents to hold fresh produce, meats, poultry, dairy as well as canned goods. The group also makes sure folks enjoy a delicious home-cooked meal, which includes dessert. “Just seeing the people’s faces that are hungry and a lot of them are handicapped and just being able to help them,” said Jerry Hackman. Hackman loves helping others. He started collecting food for his church in Pennsylvania at just nine years old and continues to volunteer with Myrtle Beach Seventh-day Adventist Church after moving to Myrtle Beach five years ago. “When you’ve grown up that way, you live your life that way. We are blessed by God and we like to give back to the community,” he said. ReFresh Our Heroes not only provides meals but also clothing, books and prayer. “We want you to know what he’s done in our lives and we are all willing to share our stories. We all have them,” said Williams. “I’ve been homeless. I’ve been without. I’ve struggled through the systems so I do understand it all. That’s why I want people to know about this church because it brought me from the pits, literally.” The group is now working to expand its mission to not only give more communities food and clothing but to also give faith and hope. “We are very glad that we are there for people and we can give them love and we can give hugs,” said Gonzalez. “Our whole purpose is to spread love. It’s not a denomination thing it’s a love thing. We just want you to know that we’re here,” said Williams. If you’d like to donate [ click here](https://www.refreshourheroes.org/).
