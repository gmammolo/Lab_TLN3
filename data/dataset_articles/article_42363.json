  "text": "European Ryder Cup star Nicolai Hojgaard has pledged his support behind LIV Golf duo Jon Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton after doubt was cast over their future in the matchplay event. Hojgaard made his Ryder Cup debut at Marco Simone last year, helping guide his team to a thumping victory over their American rivals alongside Rahm and Hatton. Their decision to make the Saudi switch however has raised questions about their chances of helping defend the crown at Bethpage Black in 2025. A number of European stalwarts have been forced to step away from the Ryder Cup scene since signing with LIV, with the likes of Ian Poulter and Sergio Garcia no longer apart of Team Europe after resigning their DP World Tour memberships. Dustin Johnson met up with PGA Tour rival who made telling admission to LIV Golf star READ MORE: Max Homa agrees with Rory McIlroy over ‘nauseating’ scenario created by LIV Golf And while Rahm and Hatton still both have their cards with the European Tour, suspensions and fines for making the LIV move could see them miss the minimum Tour events needed to hold onto their membership. Whatever the future may hold for the LIV duo, they have received the support with one of their teammates in Hojgaard. “I don’t hold anything against him (Hatton),” the Dane told National Club Golfer. “I spent some time with Jon last week (at the Masters), that was pretty cool, I haven’t seen him for a while. And to learn from him around a place he’s won and they say a specialist is very useful for me. “I could feel it going into the week and going into the back nine, obviously I had some very useful information from playing with Jon. We still have a group chat and it’s a good vibe and there’s joking around a little bit, but nothing’s changed certainly not from my side.” For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US . Nicolai Hojgaard pledged his support behind the LIV stars Hojgaard is not the first European Ryder Cup star to admit there is no bad blood with his LIV rivals, after long-time breakaway league critic Rory McIlroy. So much the Northern Irishman called on a ‘rewrite’ of the qualification rules to ensure former world No. 1 Rahm is competing in Team Europe colours next September. “Jon is going to be in Bethpage in 2025 so, because of this decision, the European Tour are going to have to rewrite the rules for Ryder Cup eligibility,” the four-time major winner McIlroy told Sky Sports in December. “There’s absolutely no question about that – I certainly want Jon Rahm on the next Ryder Cup team.” This was welcomed by Rahm who is no doubt keen to ensure he can continue to represent his continent on the Ryder Cup stage amid his home country of Spain’s rich history at the event. “I have the utmost respect for Rory McIlroy and to have his support right away is very, very special,” he told LIV’s Fairway to Heaven podcast. “It’s almost emotional to hear about it. The Ryder Cup means a lot to me and it’s one of the things that made this decision very difficult for me. I’ve always been hopeful that if I made the step, the DP World Tour (European Tour) would maybe adapt the eligibility so we could play it.”News Related - Pedestrian in his 70s dies after being struck by a lorry in Co Laois The collision involved a pedestrian and a lorry A MAN IN his 70s has died after he was struck by a lorry in Co Laois.
