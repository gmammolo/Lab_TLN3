  "text": "CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (WVIR) - Some Charlottesville students spent Thursday, April 18, splashing around with swim instructors. It was part of a one-day water safety program at the Brooks Family YMCA .\nThe program has one very straight forward goal: Keep kids safe. Scenarios included boat safety and lifebuoy training. These lessons teach kids how to keep themselves afloat and to help others in need.\n“Water safety is just an incredibly important thing,” Alice Dontanville with Piedmont Family YMCA said. “Sometimes people don’t even think about when they’re near a body of water with young children.”\nDontanville says the program also offers swim lesson vouchers.\n“How to stay at the surface of the water and how to blow bubbles so that you don’t get water in your mouth. So all of those things if you’ve never been in the water, which some of our second graders haven’t are really, really important for their safety,” she said.\nDo you have a story idea?
