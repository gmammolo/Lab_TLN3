  "text": "> When Jadyn Mucher of Houghton took the stage to sing with the Indiana Wesleyan University Chorale during a March convocation, she did not know the opportunity it would provide.\nThe Chorale , rising to sing during the induction of Ranjy Thomas into the IWU Society of World Changers, captured the attention of one of Thomas’ guests. Dylan Thomas is CEO and founder of CREATR and songwriter and music director for Hillsong United. He literally turned in his seat to take in the full effect of the IWU Chorale under the direction of Master Davy Chinn.\nAt the conclusion of the convocation at the Marion, Ind., school and during a subsequent lunch conversation, Dylan Thomas praised Chinn for the chorale’s sound — the exact tone in his quest to create a worship-centered experience for the Museum of the Bible in Washington D.C.\nHe wondered if the group would be willing to record soundtracks for the museum’s exhibit. Chinn said, “I jumped at the chance as the timing is indeed providential.”\nThe energy in the choir room was high as Mucher, a sophomore, joined her peers in the recording of the tracks. They corresponded via Microsoft Teams with the composer of the project, Harrison Wood, something the chorale members felt was a significant honor.\n“As a Chorale, it has been a great opportunity for us to share our gifts to a much wider audience,” Mucher said. “Overall, having the chance to collaborate with other artists through worship has been such a blessing for our group.”\nShe had never been a part of a recording session like the one the chorale completed, she said, and having exposure to it was insightful.\n“This week has been so fun to see both Master Chinn and Camden bounce ideas back and forth with Harrison to accomplish the goals intended for this project,” she added. “I could not be more grateful for this opportunity.”\nChinn also enjoyed the process.\n“Working directly with the composer has been a special treat as he has been able to walk us through his vision for the sound and has been able to add and alter parts on the fly as we record,” he said. “He remotes into our Pro Tools sessions so he can hear what we are tracking in real time — cool technology!”\nThe recorded tracks will contribute to the Museum of the Bible’s “All Creation Sings” exhibit , which opened Thursday, and remain a fixture of the museum for the next five years. The museum’s administration hopes to take the exhibit on tour after its conclusion on-site, so the IWU Chorale voices will ring on for years to come through the four-movement, 25-minute experience illuminating worship through video, narration, and music.\nThe exhibit has already received support from several key musicians in the Christian-music world. Artists like Brandon Lake, Brooke Ligertwood, Martin Smith, and KB all appear in a promotional video .",
