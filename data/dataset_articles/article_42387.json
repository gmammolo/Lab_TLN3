  "text": "Asim Jones’ first text from Jesse Bopp made the difference.\nInitial contact occurred after College of Southern Idaho’s first game.\nThe interest increased with each game. Other offers piled in but Jones noticed the genuine nature of it all and honored Bopp’s Florida International University squad with a commitment.\nCSI standout guard Jones signed his National Letter of Intent on Thursday with the NCAA Division I Panthers.\n“It means a lot,” Jones told the Times-News. “I definitely worked really hard to get here. Had a setback last year. Had a good experience to learn from other players. Got a chance this year. I took the role to be one of the best players on the team. Definitely feel good.”\nJones, a 2024 NJCAA Honorable Mention All-American and First Team Region 18 selection, transitioned from a role player to a key starter.\nPeople are also reading…\nCSI men’s basketball guard Asim Jones earned NJCAA Division I Honorable Mention All-American honors, announced Tuesday.\nJones, with timely speed and flashy handles, led the Golden Eagles with 17.5 points and 4.3 assists per game.\nThe Golden Eagles finished as Region 18 runners-up.\n“It is a good place for him,” CSI head coach Jeff Reinert said. “He likes that. We want all of our players to sign.”\nJones joined Kasen Carpenter (NAIA Carroll College) as CSI’s signees so far from the 2023-24 team.\nMinico alumnus Kasen Carpenter is trying to work his way back into the rotation after breaking his right hand earlier this season.\nJones waited his turn as a freshman on a squad who occupied the top national ranking for a chunk of the season and recorded the second undefeated regular season in program history.\nHe sat behind a roster full of six Division I signees, including First Team All-American guard Isaiah Moses and Honorable Mention All-American forward Rob Whaley Jr, observed their tendencies and applied those to his game as a sophomore.\n“Just being a good person,” Jones said. “If I wasn’t good, I wouldn’t be here so it wasn’t the talent. It was just me being a better person… Last year, I had a lot of talks with the coaches. I was childish. Just watching them and growing. I definitely improved.”\nJones, a Paterson, New Jersey, native, chose the Panthers from a top three which included Middle Tennessee State University and Rider University.\nFIU, based in Miami, competes in the Conference USA.\n“I can’t wait to get on the court out there, for sure,” Jones said. “Finally put on a Florida International jersey so it definitely feels good.”",
