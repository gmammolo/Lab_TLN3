  "text": "One of this year’s nine Hometown Heroes Lottery homes is in a sought-after hilltop neighbourhood in Chilliwack. The six-bedroom, 4,256 sq. ft. home sits atop Promontory in Crimson Ridge, featuring stunning views over the Chilliwack River Valley and nearby mountains. Tickets are available now for the Hometown Heroes Lottery, which supports the VGH and UBC Hospital Foundation and the BC Professional Fire Fighters’ Burn Fund. The final prize draw is on July 30, and the grand prize winner can choose one of the nine featured homes around the province, or $2.2 million in tax-free cash. The other eight homes are located in South Surrey, Vancouver, Courtenay, Sooke, West Kelowna, Burnaby, and Langley. As for the Chilliwack home, at 46086 Crestview Dr., it features a great room with 20-ft high, open-to-above ceiling, and large windows and sundecks to soak in the views. All bedrooms on the upper floor have full ensuite bathrooms, with a total of seven bathrooms in the home. The laundry room even features a floor-level dog shower. There is even a large, two-bedroom legal secondary suite with appliances, which offers a great opportunity for income or personal use. The home is worth $2.4 million, and the prize package also includes a $70,000 furniture gift certificate, a 2024 Cadillac LYRIQ electric SUV, and $250,000 in cash. Every Hometown Hero ticket purchased contributes directly to supporting funds for essential services at VGH and UBC Hospital, GF Strong Rehab Centre, and Vancouver Community Health Services, while also backing Burn Fund initiatives aiding burn and trauma survivors province-wide. These initiatives include the Home Away program, mental health support services, and the annual Burn Camp for young survivors, all making a profound impact on the lives of those in need across British Columbia. There are more than 2,700 prizes available via the Hometown Heroes Lottery, in addition to the grand prize. Participants stand the chance to win more than $3 million in prizes, including daily cash prizes, early bird prizes, and a 50/50 jackpot. Tickets are available until midnight on July 11, 2024, or until tickets are sold out. “The Hometown Heroes Lottery plays a crucial role in supporting survivor services and essential programs for burn survivors of all ages,” said Jeff Sauvé, executive director of the BC Professional Fire Fighters’ Burn Fund. “With your participation in the lottery, you are directly contributing to the enhancement of care and support for burn survivors and their families across the province and addressing their diverse needs. Together, we are making a meaningful difference in their lives.” There are multiple ticket options for the lottery, with more information at www.heroeslottery.com, by phone at 604-648-4376 or 1-866-597-4376, or in-person at any London Drugs location.
