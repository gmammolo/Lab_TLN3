  "text": "GREENE, N.Y., April 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- For four consecutive years, Forbes has been honoring The Raymond Corporation as one of America’s best midsize employers. The list recognizes employers from among 500 companies, based on an independent survey and polling of an anonymous group of employees. This year, Raymond secured the No. 5 ranking in the engineering and manufacturing sector.\n“This tremendous honor is a testament to all our Raymond associates, who work together to deliver excellence every day,” said Michael Field, president and CEO, The Raymond Corporation. “We’re thrilled to achieve this recognition again. And through our model of continuous improvement, we’re excited to keep innovating with better thinking, processes and business.”\nThe annual ranking — conducted in partnership with market research firm Statista — is based on a survey of more than 170,000 U.S.-based workers at American companies. Organizations with 1,000 to 5,000 employees are deemed midsize employers, while the companies with more than 5,000 employees are considered large. Survey respondents were asked to rate their employer and if they would recommend their employer to others. New to the methodology this year is the inclusion of data from the past three years — with more recent data weighted more heavily — to better identify companies that have been rated well consistently over time.\nThe Raymond Corporation is hiring for manufacturing and engineering positions, as well as multiple roles in marketing, product management, finance and more.
