  "text": "BRUNSWICK COUNTY, NC (WWAY) — A groundbreaking held on Thursday marked the continuation of building community. In Leland, just off Village Rd., Brunswick County Habitat for Humanity celebrated the start of construction for their new restore. The second-hand store will be 15,000 sq. ft.. Brunswick County Commissioners, Leland Town officials, and even the District Director for Congressman David Rouzer were there, among many other community partners. These restores help generate funds that help Habitat for Humanity build houses for Brunswick County families. Paul Kennedy is the President of Brunswick County Habitat for Humanity. He said Thursday showcased the hard work that goes into these projects. “This is the accumulation of four years of planning, and prep, and getting through COVID, etc. T be able to stand here today. Wonderful partnerships, we have lots of partners and lots of volunteers also,” Kennedy said. This will be the fourth Habitat for Humanity in the Brunswick County area.",
