  "text": "Middle school shows support for military children PHILADELPHIA, New York (WWNY) - It’s Purple Up For Military Kids, a day to wear purple to show support for military children. Indian River Middle School, home to many students whose parents are Fort Drum soldiers, took part in the observance on Thursday. Sixth grader Chris Tsogbe is the son of a soldier, so he knows a thing or two about frequent moves with his parents. “I have moved four times in my life, and I had to restart my life here making new friends,” he said. Students and staff wore purple shirts to celebrate the children who face unique experiences with a parent or parents serving in the military. “I hope they feel supported. I hope they feel how much we care about them. I hope they understand they’re a member of our community whether they are here for one year, two months, a week, or three years or the rest of their careers. I hope they understand they have a home here at Indian River Middle School,” said Principal Angela Green. The Children’s Home of Jefferson County provided the shirts to students and staff of Indian River Middle School. Purple represents all branches of the military and unifies everyone for Purple Up Day. “It’s really hard to be a military child and I hope people know the struggle of being one,” said Tsogbe. The Indian River Central School District works in co-operation with Fort Drum to provide [military family resources](https://www.ircsd.org/en-US/military-family-resources-0e01e186).
