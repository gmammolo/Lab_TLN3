  "text": "A recent peer reviewed study indicates that children who spend time with therapy dogs can lower their stress even more than with relaxation exercises.\nThat outcome becomes even more important when the child is in the hospital. But what happens when there are not enough therapy dogs?\nMeet Otis, Max and Stride.\nSeven-year-old Josh Summitt misses walking his dogs during his stay in the hospital. So, Stanford Children’s Health introduced him to the next best thing.\n“I kinda felt a little bit nervous to meet the dogs. But after I met them, they were very, very friendly,” Josh said.\nThe robotic dogs, known as Max, Otis and Stride, are Stanford’s way of curbing the anxiety felt by their young patients.\nThe endeavor is a collaboration between the university’s robotic students and the hospital’s Chariot Program, which seeks out innovations that can help patients.\n“A lot of robotics technologies get developed in a lab and never have any real impact on the world. But we can see immediately the impact, cheering these kids up,” said Stanford engineering student Gabriel Levine.\nWhile therapy animals have long been known to help reduce pain, anxiety and depression, doctors are encouraged that the robotic dogs are already showing some of the same benefits.\n\"It’s amazing. They’re so joyful. I think that having these robotic puppies be a part of our team has allowed us to engage them in a way that was not possible before,” said Dr. Ellen Wang , co-director of the Chariot Program.\n“We've had experiences in the past where a patient enjoyed hanging out with the robot so much, he almost forgot he was going to surgery, and that’s really powerful,” added Dr. Teresa Nguyen , anesthesiologist at Stanford Children’s Health.\nJosh’s mom, Amelia Summitt, has also seen a difference.\n“And it's really sparked his curiosity. He can still be seven and be excited and play,” she said.\nStanford Children’s Health is just completing its pilot phase with the robots, and based upon the popular response, this is only the beginning.\nThe Stanford students are now developing a new version of the robot dog that promises to be even more agile than before.\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save",
