Aamir Khan to grace the show ](https://www.tellychakkar.com/digital/the-great-indian-kapil-show-exclusive-aamir-khan-grace-the-show-240322) The actor said, \"When you get to play characters like this, the responsibility is huge. I met Sam Bahadurâ€™s daughter Maya (aged between 75-80 years) multiple times to understand how he walked and spoke. We were shooting in Delhi, and I have never been so nervous in front of the camera.\" \"Sam Bahadurâ€™s daughter was watching the shot behind the camera. I was scared because I knew I would not dare to ask whether I did it right or not. I just knew that if in her eyes I saw that she did not like it, then my confidence would be shattered, and more than half the film was left to be shot. But, I was very happy to see that she had tears in her eyes after watching the shot, and that boosted my confidence,\" he shared. The actor added, \"For me, the biggest award is when a military film is approved by the military and they call out your performance.\" 'The Great Indian Kapil Show' airs on Netflix, its three episodes already aired. The season kicked off with a star-studded episode featuring Ranbir Kapoor, Neetu Kapoor, and Riddhima Kapoor. This was followed by an exciting episode with cricketers Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer.
