  "text": "(UPI) A British sheep farmer said she found a surprising solution for curbing the aggression of her rams -- Axe body spray.\nSam Bryce, who raises sheep on the Norfolk-Suffolk border in England, said it was other farmers on the Facebook group Ladies Who Lamb who told her the Africa variety of the body spray, known as Lynx in Britain and other countries where the Axe trademark was not available, masks the hormones that cause rams to become aggressive toward one another.\nBryce told The Wall Street Journal that since she started using the heavily-perfumed body spray on the animals, \"There's no argy-bargy, no rowing.\"\nShe said using body spray to calm rams is a growing practice.\n\"There are several of us doing it right across the country and I think even the world now,\" Bryce told ITV News.\n Some fellow sheep farmers said the body spray is good for more than just keeping rams calm -- Suffolk shepherdess Caitlin Jenkins said she uses the same variety to convince mother sheep to adopt abandoned lambs.\nShe said ewes identify their babies by smell, and using the body spray confuses them into thinking the lambs belong to them.\n\"I always go for Lynx Africa because it has a very distinctive strong smell,\" she said. The ones that don't smell as strong have less chance of working.\nCopyright 2024 by United Press International\nComments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Share",
