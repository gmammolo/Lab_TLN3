  "text": "(UPI) A Michigan woman made an extra stop on her way to pick up a pizza and scored a $2 million prize from a scratch-off lottery ticket.\nThe 41-year-old Macomb County woman told Michigan Lottery officials she dipped into Party Place Liquor on Schoenherr Road in Shelby Township on her way to pick up a pizza.\n\"My husband is usually the one who buys scratch off tickets, but I decided to stop and buy one on my way to pick up pizza,\" she said.\nThe woman selected a $2,000 Large instant game and continued on to the pizzeria.\n \"While I was waiting for my pizza, I sat in my car and scratched the ticket. It was surreal when I realized I'd won $2 million. I called my husband to tell him the big news because I was so excited. I couldn't wait until I got home,\" the player said.\nThe winner said she plans to use her prize money to pay bills and take a vacation.\nCopyright 2024 by United Press International\nComments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Share",
