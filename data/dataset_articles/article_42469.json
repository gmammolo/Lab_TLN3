  "text": "HAPPY INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\nWomen are essential to our success at Wellington College China schools. Whether they are inspiring the pupils in the classrooms and art studios or working behind the scenes in the administrative offices, this IB school in China witnesses their passion and commitment every day, blazing trails as learners, connectors and changemakers. Today, in honour of International Women’s Day, we are sharing the stories of six Wellington women who truly embody Wellington College China ’s ‘Be You. Be More.’ spirit.\nWe are learners who empower growth\nElisa Yan\nTeacher of Chinese\nEdTech Lead\nWellington College Tianjin\n“What matters is what you can bring to the job, what skills and abilities you possess are more important.”\nElisa started at Wellington College Tianjin as a teacher of Chinese, but her commitment and hard work soon elevated her to the position of EdTech Lead. She now works across departments, finding ways to enhance teaching and learning with innovative technologies. Elisa's success underscores that a woman’s talents and abilities are not limited by her chosen fields and that the only limitations we face are the ones we impose upon ourselves.\nDeborah Bauman\nTeacher of Art\nHuili School Hangzhou\n“I believe in the transformative power of art to create positive change in the world.”\nDeborah’s passion for art is driven by her desire to share it with as many people as possible. She puts in countless hours of hard work towards this goal, believing that artwork created purely from the heart creates deep connections between us. Her wish is for every aspiring female artist to find happiness and fulfilment on their creative journey. And it certainly shines through in her art classes.\nWe are connectors who build cultural bridges\nViolin Wang\nExecutive Assistant to Master\nSchool Office Manager\nHuili School Nantong\n“The key importance of building communities is that it gives us a strong sense of belongingness.”\nA founding member of Huili School Nantong, Violin has made an invaluable contribution to her school from the very beginning. She has witnessed firsthand the incredible progress and success that can be achieved when the whole community work towards a common goal.\nEmily Gu\nTeacher\nOutdoor learning champion\nHuili Nursery Shanghai\n“There are limitless opportunities for women in every profession.”\nOutdoor learning is a key pillar of our Early Years provision, and Emily is one of its greatest champions. She collaborates across nurseries, classrooms and year groups to ensure that our youngest learners at Huili Nursery Shanghai and Wellington’s Early Years Centre build strong bodies as well as strong minds. She is truly an inspiration to all those who seek to empower and nurture children's limitless potential.\nWe are changemakers who inspire limitless potential\nSharon Ni\nStudent Leadership\nCoordinator\nTeacher of Chinese\nHuili School Shanghai\n“Our programme aims to empower pupils in the field of charity so they can excel in the future.”\nSharon teaches Huili pupils the transformative power of charity through initiatives like the Dream Café Project. This ongoing initiative provides real-world vocational training to young people with disabilities. Participants learn to be self-sufficient and gain more confidence as they enter the job market. Likewise, Huili pupils acquire important soft skills like teamwork, time management and communication as they put the Huili value of kindness into practice.\nGiselle Slade\nHead of Learning Support\nWellington College\nInternational Shanghai\n“You have the power to define who you are.”\nAs a Model UN coordinator, Giselle teaches pupils from this British school Shanghai empathy, teamwork, negotiation and communication — the fundamentals of global citizenship. But she also believes that Model UN is an important platform for empowering young women. Every year, she watches a new class of remarkable young women in Wellington College International Shanghai find their voice and learn to speak with clarity and conviction. She’s confident that they will go out into the world and make a positive impact wherever they go.\nHAPPY INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY!\nAs a Shanghai private school , Wellington College International Shanghai hopes these stories inspire every woman to discover her purpose, ask what she wants, and take ownership of her future.\nFor her, by her.\nHappy International Women's Day!\nShanghai international school admission in progress, welcome to apply!\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Wellington College International Shanghai\nContact Person: Admission Department\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: +86-21 5185-3866\nAddress: No.1500 Yao Long Road, Pudong New District\nCity: Shanghai\nCountry: China\nWebsite: https://shanghai.wellingtoncollege.cn/",
