  "text": "EAST TAWAS, Mich. (WJRT) - A grand reopening ceremony for the Tawas Point Lighthouse in the [Tawas Point State Park](https://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=499&type=SPRK&utm_campaign=tawas+point+light+grand+reopening&utm_medium=pr&utm_source=govdelivery) will be held on May 2. The event will be held from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., starting with an official reopening ceremony. Following the ceremony, visitors can check out vendor booths, including the Tawas Bay Art Gallery, Heritage Coast Sailing and Rowing, and Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary, live music and lunch from food trucks, browse the gift shop and take a free tour of the lighthouse. The ceremony is free of charge, but a state park pass is required for vehicle entry. In Feb. 2023, the park received $455,500 in ARPA funds. The project was also outlined in Gov. Gretchen Whtmer's Building Michigan Together Plan. The primary focus was reversing the exterior deterioration of the lighthouse tower, the lantern room and the gallery. The lantern and gallery colors will look different to repeat visitors. The colors say the paint color will reflect what the lighthouse looked like in 1895. The DNR says that May 2 is a fitting date for the grand reopening ceremony because it marks the 147 anniversary when the lighthouse began to shine. The lighthouse will be open to the public on May 8 and be open for tour Wednesday through Monday from 12 - 5 p.m. until Oct. 20. Tours cost $5. Every Tuesday from June 4 through Aug. 27, the Friends of the Tawas Point Lighthouse and State Park will conduct tours by donation.
