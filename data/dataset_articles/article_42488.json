  "text": "Fargo Police say officer went above and beyond to save suicidal man’s life FARGO, N.D. (Valley News Live) - The Fargo Police Department is commending an officer for locating a suicidal man, and saving his life. Fargo Police were called around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, April 13, to help the Moorhead Police Department find an actively suicidal male. At the time, they didn’t know where the man was, but they had information to believe he was in the process of attempting to end his life. Moorhead Police initiated a GPS location search of the man’s cell phone, which narrowed his location down to a quarter mile radius in south Fargo. “While maintaining active communication with the man’s wife for approximately one hour, Officer Jake Skelly showed exceptional determination in exhausting all possible leads,” the Fargo Police Department said. Officer Skelly had the man’s wife check their recent online banking activities and learned the man had checked into a hotel in the 1400 Block of 35th Street South. Skelly saw the man’s vehicle in the parking lot and figured out which room he was in. He didn’t receive a response from anyone in the room, but based on the life-threatening circumstances and other information he had about the man’s deteriorating condition, Officer Skelly entered the hotel room and provided immediate life-saving care. “Officer Skelly’s determination to locate this man demonstrated the department core values of Professionalism and Guardianship as his actions led directly to the preservation of this man’s life,” the department said. Area law enforcement say mental health, depression and suicidal thoughts continue to be a growing battle for many within our community. If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health, seek help by seeing a mental health professional.
