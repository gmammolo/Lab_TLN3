  "text": "KALAMAZOO, Mich — After five years, Western Michigan linebacker Damari Roberson 's time in college football is coming to an end. \"It's bittersweet to know this is my last ride,\" Roberson said. His ride up to this point has been anything but smooth. \"It is a stepping stone for me knowing that I made it through everything I made it through,\" Roberson said. He has been through a lot. Roberson was supposed to sign with Northwestern out of Mona Shores High School , but then he tore his left ACL twice and the Wildcats decided to move on. He ended up at Western, where in Kalamazoo his luck did not get any better. He tore his right ACL in 2020. That is three ACL tears and three ACL surgeries, but that did not stop him. \"I just went with my gut,\" Roberson said. \"My gut is telling me that I can do this, so I am getting back on the horse.\" Then, nearly five years later, was back on the field in a non-special teams role. Roberson played on the defensive side of the ball in the 2022 season opener at Michigan State. \"I go through a lot of emotions sometimes thinking about it when I do reminisce about it,\" Roberson said. \"I am happy and blessed to still be out here and still be able to play the game I love.\" That love he shows for the game radiates throughout the Broncos locker room. \"Damari has grit and resilience,\" Western Michigan head coach [Lance Taylor](/video/sports/full-interview-lance-taylor-wmus-new-football-head-coach/69-d5187e2e-f98d-4d4b-95a9-b1eac977ca98) said. \"He is probably one of the most respected players on our team. He is loved by his teammates by how he carries himself and how he handles himself every day and how he works.\" His work ethic is second to none. \"You can't question my worth because I will outwork you any day,\" Roberson said. \"We can go test it out any day.\" Taylor values that mentality from the redshirt senior. \"He has really taken the next step in terms of leadership and feeling like he is one of the captains of our defense right now and our team,\" Taylor said. Roberson has earned that praise, and after everything he has been through, he will never take anything for granted. \"Never give up on your dreams,\" Roberson said. \"If it is important to you and if it is something you really want to do, you will do anything just to get it done.\" Roberson still has one last spring game at Western before his final fall of football in Kalamazoo. The Broncos have their spring showcase on Saturday at Waldo Stadium. Kickoff is set for 2 p.m. ►Make it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this. Download the 13 ON YOUR SIDE app now .
