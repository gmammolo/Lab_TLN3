  "text": "(Gray News) – Taylor Swift confirmed that the first single from her new album “The Tortured Poets Department” will be her collaboration with Post Malone titled “Fortnight.” In an Instagram post Thursday afternoon, Swift announced the single, saying that she has “been such a huge fan of Post because of the writer he is, his musical experimentation and those melodies he creates that just stick in your head forever.” She continued, “I got to witness that magic come to life firsthand when we worked together on ‘Fortnight.’” “Fortnight” is listed as track No. 1 on “The Tortured Poets Department.” Swift also announced that the music video for “Fortnight” will premiere Friday at 8 p.m. ET. Fans will be able to hear the song for the first time when the entirety of “The Tortured Poets Department” releases Friday at 12 a.m. ET. Swift did not release any songs on the album prior to its release, leaving fans guessing what the new music will sound like. The highly anticipated “The Tortured Poets Department” is Swift’s eleventh studio album. Copyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",
