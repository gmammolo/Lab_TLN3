  "text": "President Marcos was named one of TIME Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People of 2024.\nUnder the category of “Leaders,” Mr. Marcos joined other personalities such as Yulia Navalnaya, wife of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny; European Council president Donald Tusk; jailed 2023 Nobel Peace Prize winner and human rights activist Narges Mohammadi; and Taiwan’s incoming president, Lai Ching-te, also known as William Lai, among others.\n“Bongbong’s desire to rehabilitate the Marcos name has resulted in other shifts. He brought technocrats back into government, steadied the post-pandemic economy, and elevated the Philippines on the world stage,” the renowned magazine said of Mr. Marcos.\n“Bongbong has stood steadfast against Chinese aggression in the disputed South China Sea and bolstered his nation’s alliance with the US in the face of ‘rising tensions in our region and the world,’ as he said last May.”\n“Many problems persist, including extra-judicial killings and journalists routinely attacked. But by trying to repair his family name, Bongbong may reshape his country, too,” TIME said.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Presidential Communications Office said Mr. Marcos’ inclusion in the list can be attributed to his brand of leadership.\n“(It) reflects his brand of leadership that puts the national interest and the welfare of every Filipino above all else. Under his administration, the Philippines has experienced robust economic growth and recovery, exceeding expectations and instilling confidence in the country’s economic outlook,” the PCO said.\n“Despite geopolitical tensions and the hurdles posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, President Marcos has elevated the Philippines on the world stage and contributed to regional stability, notably in the Indo-Pacific region.”\nOther Filipinos who made it to TIME Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the past are former president Rodrigo Duterte, former senator Leila de Lima, and journalist Maria Ressa.\nHis father, the late president Ferdinand Marcos Sr., also landed on the magazine’s cover in 1966 while the late former president Corazon Aquino was named TIME Woman of the Year for 1987.",
