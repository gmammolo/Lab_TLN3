Chicago, IL, April 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — The Magnificent Mile® Association unveiled a vibrant symbol of Chicago on April 17 – The Magnificent Mile™ Tulip! This captivating flower showcases a stunning blend of rich yellow petals with a tangerine blush, elegantly outlined in a soft red. The colors deepen as the bloom matures, creating a dynamic display that will grace Michigan Avenue through late April. The Magnificent Mile Tulip can exclusively be seen at 625 North Michigan Avenue, where 4,000 inaugural bulbs were planted last fall, and now grace the gardens with their vibrant color. A Collaboration with the Consul General of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Chicago The Magnificent Mile Tulip represents a collaborative effort between the association and key partners. “We are thrilled to introduce this unique tulip,” said Kimberly Bares, spokesperson for The Magnificent Mile Association. “The project highlights the enduring beauty of The Magnificent Mile and the vibrant spirit of Chicago. We’d like to express our sincere gratitude to Consul General Bart Twaalfhoven of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Chicago. His guidance and expertise, along with the long-standing relationship between our organizations, were instrumental in bringing this vision to life.” Consul General Twaalfhoven echoed the sentiment, stating, “The tulip display on Michigan Avenue is truly exceptional, closely equaling those witnessed in the Netherlands itself. The Magnificent Mile Tulip beautifully captures the spirit of both cultures, and I’m honored to be a part of this collaboration.” Landscape professionals can add The Magnificent Mile Tulip to their fall planting palettes through De Vroomen Garden Products ( www.devroomen.com ) , the exclusive distributor of these unique bulbs.
