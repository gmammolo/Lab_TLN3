  "text": "City leaders celebrate milestone in construction of new MLK Dream Center SOUTH BEND, Ind. (WNDU) - The city of South Bend is celebrating a significant milestone in the construction of the new Martin Luther King Jr. Dream Center. Common council members, and city partners hosted a steel topping ceremony on Thursday to mark the placing of the last steel beam on the center facility. Attendees had an opportunity to sign the beam before its placement. The center will replace the old King Center that served the community for over 50 years. The new facility boasts 40,000 square feet and [comes with a $24.5 million price tag](https://www.wndu.com/2023/10/24/mlk-dream-center-funding-approved-245-million/). “To be able to really champion and empower the next generation of leaders, and that’s in every fashion as it relates to after school programming, as it relates to fitness, recreation, and even our financial empowerment center,’ said Jordan Gathers, director of south Bend Venues Parks & Arts. “This is really going to be a holistic approach, and we’re looking forward to it.” The MLK Dream Center has an expected completion date of February 2025.
