  "text": "WASHINGTON — Ashanti and Nelly are expecting their first child together and are also engaged, the couple [announced exclusively with Essence magazine](https://www.essence.com/celebrity/black-celeb-couples/ashanti-nelly-engaged/). “This new year of my life is such a blessing full of love, hope, and anticipation,\" Ashanti, 43, told the outlet. \"Motherhood is something that I have looked forward to, and sharing this with my family, fiancé, and loyal fans, who have been so supportive of my career, is an amazing experience.” Wednesday's announcement also [ featured a video of Ashanti ](https://www.instagram.com/p/C54BrRBvKBq/)getting ready for a performance and when she's asked how much time she's going to need, Ashanti replies, \"I'm going to need about nine months.\" The clip then showed [ a logo for Proov](https://proovtest.com/pages/why-proov), which are at-home fertility and hormone marker tests for individuals looking to get pregnant. The \"Baby\" singer and \"Hot in Herre\" rapper shared with Essence that they are co-owners in the company, along with its founder. While the singers first began their relationship in 2003, they officially called it quits in 2013. Last May, a [source confirmed to ET](https://www.etonline.com/nelly-and-ashanti-are-back-together-and-very-happy-after-2013-split-203951) that the couple were back together and \"very happy.\" There had been [pregnancy rumors surrounding the couple since December 2023](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/ashanti-is-pregnant-expecting-1st-baby-with-boyfriend-nelly/), when they attended Nelly's 11th Black and White Ball in St. Louis. [Video from the event, obtained by TMZ,](https://www.tmz.com/2023/12/04/nelly-ashanti-pregnancy-rumors-black-and-white-ball/) showed that while onstage Ashanti placed her hands on her stomach and Nelly followed suit, before they both burst out in laughter. Afterward, US Weekly cited a source saying the couple were expecting their first baby together. This will be Ashanti's first child. Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Iral Haynes Jr., [has two children from a previous relationship](https://people.com/all-about-nelly-kids-7564708) and adopted his sister's son and daughter after she died of leukemia in March 2005.",
