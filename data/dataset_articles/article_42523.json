  "text": "Louisiana-born singer/songwriter Lainey Wilson is red hot today in the country music genre. Thanks to her 2022 album Bell Bottom Country and its fiery hit single “Wildflowers and Wild Horses,” Wilson’s name has rocketed up the charts and she’s garnered handfuls of prestigious awards.\nBut while “Wildflowers and Wild Horses” is a whiplash of a song, that doesn’t mean Wilson doesn’t know how to live on the sensitive side of the sonic street. Indeed, just as she is able to walk through a ring of flames , Wilson is able to tug at your heartstrings. And these three songs from the artist are evidence of just that.\n[RELATED: Top 10 Lainey Wilson Songs]\n“Rolling Stone,” from Sayin’ What I’m Thinkin’ (2021) One of the most important aspects of country music is the honesty it can offer, that heart-on-your sleeve quality. And on Wilson’s 2021 album Sayin’ What I’m Thinkin’ , she offers that exact quality, especially on the LP’s 11th track, “Rolling Stone.” The track is about love but it’s also about distance—a combination that can tug at anyone’s soul. On the offering, Wilson sings of the juxtaposition between the two.\nAin’t got a thing to do with love\nI was born to roll like a tumbleweed does\nAnd I belong to a long highway\nAnd there it goes, callin’ my name\nCallin’ my name\nCallin’ my name\nThink you’re the one that’s gonna turn me around\nGive me a ring and settle me down\nGot a little old on me, don’t get me wrong\nBut, baby, my heart runs wild and free\nYou gotta know ‘fore you fall for me\nLike a feather in the wind, I could be gone\nYou don’t give a rock to a rolling stone\nNo, you don’t give a rock to a rolling stone\n“Heart Like a Truck,” from Bell Bottom Country (2022) From Wilson’s 2022 album Bell Bottom Country , this song is both powerful and melancholy. Wilson compares her heart to a country music staple—a truck. It’s both sturdy and well-worn; reliable and used. On the song, she’s vulnerable—she goes as far to say heart’s been drug through the mud , which is something many of us can relate to in our own lives.\nI never stay in one place too long\nA dirt road’s singing me a siren song\nI gotta find a field\nI need to spin my wheels\nI got a hankering for four wide tires\nAnd I can’t help it it’s the way I’m wired\n‘Fore you get too close\nBoy you need to know\nI got a heart like a truck\nIt’s been drug through the mud\nRuns on dreams and gasoline\nAnd that ole highway holds the key\nIt’s got a lead foot down when it’s leaving\nLord knows it’s taken a hell of a beating\nA little bit of love is all that it’s needing\nBut it’s good as it is tough\nI got a heart like a truck\n“Things a Man Oughta Know,” from Sayin’ What I’m Thinkin’ (2020) Sometimes when you hear words of wisdom the right way, they can make you pause and reflect both on your life and who you were in it. Sometimes it takes an emotional gut punch to stop you in your tracks and help you change course. That’s exactly what this song does. Released first on Wilson’s 2020 Redneck Hollywood EP (and later on the 2021 album Sayin’ What I’m Thinkin’ ), this is the song that put Wilson on the proverbial map—and for good reason. She presents a wise and generous self, mixing with an emotive quality that can put a lump in your throat.\nIf I can’t have it, I can do without\nI can hang a picture same as I can take it down\nAnd how to keep it hidden when a heart gets broke\nYeah, I know a few things a man oughta know\nHow to know when it’s love\nHow to stay when it’s tough\nHow to know you’re messin’ up a good thing\nAnd how to fix it ‘fore it’s too late\nAnd yeah, I know a boy\nWho gave up and got it wrong\nIf you really love a woman, you don’t let her go\nYeah, I know a few things a man oughta know\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.\nPhoto by Kevin Winter/Getty Images",
