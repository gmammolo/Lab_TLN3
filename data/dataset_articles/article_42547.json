  "text": "MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. – Hosted by Epilepsy Alliance Florida, the annual Walk the Talk for Epilepsy is the largest community event in the area that raises awareness and funds for people living with the neurological disease.\nThe two-mile walk will take place this Saturday at Zoo Miami, located at 12400 SW 152nd St. Local 10 reporter Saira Anwer will serve as the emcee.\nRecommended Videos\n“Those who are living with epilepsy have to walk a tough path each and every day,” said Karen Basha Egozi, President and CEO of Epilepsy Alliance Florida. “Walking together in unity, this event symbolizes the support we provide to the more than half a million Floridians impacted by this disease and raises critical awareness of it in our local communities.”\n(Epilepsy Alliance Florida) Among the family-friendly entertainment, music and special character appearances, the walk will highlight the journey of 16-year-old Jose Pablo Saenz, who’s been living with drug-resistant epilepsy for almost 10 years.\nSaenz will be honored with the Epilepsy Alliance Florida’s Clayton Feig Youth Award, an award commemorating youth who battle seizures and that highlights the important work of those dedicated to removing the stigma associated with epilepsy.\n“For Jose’s family, support has extended beyond the operating room, not only from their medical team at Nicklaus Children’s Hospital but Epilepsy Alliance Florida,” added Egozi. “They are grateful for all the activities the Alliance offers, especially opportunities where Jose can be around others just like him – like the Miami Walk the Talk for Epilepsy.”\nRegistration for the walk kicks off at 7:30 a.m. To participate and find out more, visit walkthetalk.org .\nCopyright 2024 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.",
