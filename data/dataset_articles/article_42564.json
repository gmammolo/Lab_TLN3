  "text": "Palestinians have been flocking to the beach in Gaza this week, as temperatures soared and families took advantage of a lull in fighting in most of the area.\nA displaced Palestinian boy plays with a dog on the beach in Gaza Strip as people flee to the seashore from the high temperatures inside the displacement tents and try to escape from the bitter reality of war on Wednesday, April 17, 2024.

(Photo by AFP) (Photo by -/AFP via Getty Images)\nIsrael pulled out its ground forces from southern Gaza earlier this month, leaving one brigade in control of an access road that divides the northern and southern Gaza Strip. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers have continued to attack Hamas in targeted operations, but most areas of Gaza are enjoying calm.\nPalestinians gather on the beach in Deir el-Balah in the central Gaza Strip on April 17, 2024, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the militant group Hamas.

There is so much food entering Gaza that the prices of commodities like flour and eggs have collapsed .\nA Palestinian child swims at a beach in Deir el-Balah in the central Gaza Strip on April 17, 2024, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the militant group Hamas.

(Photo by Ashraf Amra/Anadolu via Getty Images)\nThough aid organizations and foreign critics of Israel continue to warn about “famine,” there is evidence of plenty in the Gaza Strip. The IDF unit known as COGAT (Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories) posted photographs of markets in Gaza brimming with fruit, vegetables, and other food items for sale.\nMarket scenes in northern Gaza yesterday, April 17 pic.twitter.com/bI4DTWMLwa\n— COGAT (@cogatonline) April 18, 2024\nAs images of Gazans at the beach circulated on social media, many pro-Israel voices pointed to the photos as evidence that there is no “famine” or “genocide” in Gaza.\nIsrael is still planning an attack on the city of Rafah, in southern Gaza, which is the last Hamas stronghold.\nJoel B.
