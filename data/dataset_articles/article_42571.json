  "text": "United Way Campaign Celebration Highlights Trent Support Trent University and Trent campaign coordinators recognized for going “above and beyond” Trent’s annual United Way campaign was recognized with two Spirit Awards at the United Way of Peterborough & District’s 2023 campaign wrap-up event. Trent’s $117,000 campaign earned the University hardware for Outstanding Workplace Campaign (large). Thanks to the involvement and generosity of staff, faculty and retirees, Trent University has maintained the title of the United Way’s largest corporate supporter, generating a significant positive impact on the region. Alison Scholl, senior manager, Community & External Relations, and MK Millard, community relations officer, received the Champions of Change award for their efforts leading the annual fundraising drive. This award recognizes outstanding leadership, dedication and passion inspiring colleagues to get involved in the workplace campaign. “The United Way agency partners do hard work, creating the programs and resources to support our community. We get to do the fun work of celebrating the United Way and encouraging Team Trent to join us in giving back,” Scholl said upon receiving the award. Trent has supported the United Way since 1965, raising more than $2.7 million.",
