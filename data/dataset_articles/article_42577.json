  "text": "Former Harlem star Kadin Bergstrom earns national honor with Rockford University baseball [Jay Taft](/staff/6053112002/jay-taft/) Kadin Bergstrom, a sophomore infielder at Rockford University and a former Harlem Huskie, became the first Regents first baseman selected to the D3baseball.com Team of the Week after he extended his streak to five straight games with a home run on Saturday. Bergstrom homered over the left-field fence in the top of the ninth during a 7-1 loss for his fourth homer of the week, and his school-record-setting fifth straight game with a round-tripper. And although his streak came to a close when he went homer-less in a doubleheader split with Concordia Chicago on Wednesday, he had already done enough to make the prestigious [D3baseball.com Team of the Week](https://d3baseball.com/landing/index). Bergstrom is the first Regent baseball player to be named to the D3baseball.com Team of the Week since 2022. More Rockford University sports: [Rockford University's one-legged baseball player 'fell in love with the game'](/story/sports/college/baseball/2023/04/13/rockford-universitys-one-legged-baseball-player-fits-right-in/70077047007/) On the week, he had three multi-hit games and two three-hit performances, homering in all four games to extend his streak to five straight games with a home run. Bergstrom went 6-for-9 with three homers, a double, six RBIs and six runs scored just in Rockford's sweep of Wisconsin Lutheran on April 9. He then went 3-for-7 with two more home runs, two RBIs and two runs scored at Concordia Wisconsin last Saturday. For the week he hit .563, slugged 1.563, had five home runs, a double, eight RBIs and eight runs scored. Bergstrom went 0-for-3 in Saturday's first game of the doubleheader to snap his homer streak. However, Joseph Stagowski went 3-for-4 and blasted two homers, including a walk-off solo homer run in the 6-5 win. The Regents are getting hot at the right time, posting wins in five of their last eight games. The 6-foot-3, 240-pounder, Bergstrom, is now hitting .318 with eight homers, four doubles and 21 RBIs while slugging .632. Bergstrom and Rockford (11-17, 7-7 NACC) will next host a doubleheader against St. Norbert on Saturday. The Regents play their home games at Pohlman Field in Beloit, Wisconsin.
