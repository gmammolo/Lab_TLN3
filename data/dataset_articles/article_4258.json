  "text": "Audio By Carbonatix\nThe Minister for the Interior, Muntaka Mubarak, has credited the orderly conduct of the ongoing recruitment exercise for the internal security services to the introduction of comprehensive digital reforms.\nHe said the changes were informed by a thorough assessment of earlier recruitment processes, which exposed significant weaknesses, including irregularities and opportunities for abuse.\nMr Muntaka made the remarks while speaking to journalists during a visit to the Prisons Borstal Recruitment Screening Centre in Accra on Wednesday, January 21, during which he observed the screening process firsthand.\nAccording to the Minister, government deliberately overhauled the system to eliminate practices such as the sale of recruitment slots and other fraudulent activities that have in the past undermined public confidence.\n“When we came into office, we reviewed the previous recruitment exercise and found several lapses. We therefore took a decision to correct those shortcomings by examining the entire process and determining how far digitalisation could be applied,” he explained.\nHe noted that the reforms now cover the full recruitment cycle, including access to application forms, the submission of details, and communication with applicants, adding that the fully digital approach has enhanced transparency, fairness, and efficiency across the exercise.\n“What you are seeing today is the outcome of that digitalisation. From obtaining the forms to completing them and receiving information, everything is now done digitally,” Mr Muntaka said.",
