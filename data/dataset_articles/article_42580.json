  "text": "HELEMANO MILITARY RESERVATION, Hawai’i — Community engagement was in full stride at the Helemano Military Reservation during a \"Walking Town Hall\" held April 17. Kicking off at 3:30 p.m. Hawai’i Standard Time at the Helemano Community Center, the gathering featured U.S. Army Garrison Hawai'i, Garrison Commander Col. Steven McGunegle, representatives from Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO), Island Palm Communities (IPC) and the Housing Services Office (HSO), housing team.\nThe town hall addressed a wide array of issues aimed at enhancing community living through improved infrastructure and services. A significant focus was placed on the integration of renewable energy solutions, such as the future installation of battery storage units to boost energy efficiency and reliability in housing areas.\nOne highlight from the event was the community's request for extended gym hours, reflecting a strong desire to improve residents' quality of life. Col. McGunegle and team led discussions on topics ranging from neighborhood watch programs to military police patrols and childcare services, emphasizing a holistic approach to community concerns.\nHECO representatives provided updates on efforts to stabilize the power supply, acknowledging the need for scheduled outages to facilitate necessary upgrades and repairs. They reassured residents of ongoing support and improvements to the power infrastructure. \"We have contingencies in place to swiftly handle any issues and ensure our community receives reliable electric power,\" stated a HECO representative.\nCol. McGunegle highlighted the importance of the Tenant Survey in guiding these improvements, encouraging residents to continue offering feedback. \"It’s essential that everyone in our community has a voice and feels heard. These discussions help us implement changes that truly make a difference,\" he remarked.\nAs the walking meeting wrapped up, community leaders encouraged ongoing dialogue and invited further questions or comments at the Community Center. Today's Walking Town Hall not only facilitated immediate communication but also reinforced the commitment to transparency and collaborative solutions within the Helemano community.",
