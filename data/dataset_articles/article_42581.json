  "text": "(CNN) - Cat videos are big on the internet, but one Chicago-area Bengal cat has gone viral with over 50 million views on TikTok.\nRemi is being called the “Michael Jordan of cats.” That’s because of the way he went flying over a couch when something startled him.\nThere have been stories of enormous cats and a slap-happy cat slapping a judge at a cat show, but this one is a blur.\n“This is the flying cat,” Julia Amidei said, introducing her cat, Remi.\nTwo-year-old Remi hid behind some hanging coats as his housemate Luci the cat decided to come play.\nBut when Luci knocked a coat off the hook, Remi went bonkers.\n“What the (expletive) just happened?” Amidei’s boyfriend Nick is heard saying in the video.\nThose immortal words escaped Nick’s lips as Remi flew across the room, completely clearing the couch where Nick sat.\n“My cat has wings,” Amidei said.\nAmidei said Remi is fine.\n“He landed on this,” she said, showing an interactive cat toy.\nCommenters were awestruck. They called him “the Michael Jordan of cats.”\n“But I’ve never seen him get air like that in my life,” Amidei said.\nThe dog of the house, Maggie, was singled out online for her chill reaction.\n“And then just looks at my boyfriend like, ‘There they go again,’” Amidei said, talking about Maggie’s reaction.\nThe stratospheric leap went explosively viral and many labeled Remi the very definition of a scaredy cat.\nBut Remi took being jumpy to a whole new level.\nCopyright 2024 CNN Newsource.
