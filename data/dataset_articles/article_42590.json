  "text": "POCAHONTAS, Ark. (KAIT) - Public safety departments across the United States are honoring 911 dispatchers’ work during National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week. In Randolph County, E911 Coordinator Hampton Owens explained that 911 dispatchers guard the line between life and death with every phone call. “We dispatch for eight fire departments, an ambulance service, the local police department, and the Randolph County Sheriff’s Office,” Owens explained. Dispatchers send help to those in shootings, fires, accidents, or any other life-threatening situation. “We average anywhere between 20-25 911 calls a day, ranging from accidental dials to major catastrophes, wrecks, and fires,” Owens stated. Owens said being a 911 dispatcher is more than just the average nine-to-five. “It’s not something that you can just get up in the morning and say, ‘Hey I’m going to get up and go be a 911 dispatcher.’ It’s something that you have to love, you’ve got to be able to love your job, and you have to be called to do it,” Owens explained. As the dispatchers face immense pressure on an everyday basis. “It’s extremely stressful. You can go from having a good time, talking and visiting with one another, and then everything go haywire and crazy,” Owens stated. Sheriff Kevin Bell said without dispatchers, it’d be hard to get help to where it needs to go. “They’re vitally important to our role in law enforcement and public safety,” the sheriff stated. Owens added in recent years, hiring and retaining workers has been a struggle, but the job is one of the most rewarding you’ll find. To report a typo or correction, please click here .
