  "text": "Something to smile about: Man honored for volunteer work in county fair SALEM, Ark. (KAIT) - A county fair volunteer who passed away in December was honored by the State of Arkansas on Wednesday. Fulton County resident, Noble Lewis, served in multiple capacities for the Fulton County Fair. He and his wife, Carolyn, would work tirelessly throughout the year to make sure the county fair could be put on. On Wednesday, the Arkansas House of Representatives presented Carolyn and their family with a citation, honoring the work Lewis contributed to the county fair. “Anything that needed doing, if it included unloading supplies, going to pick up supplies, anything like that, he did it. He helped hang banners in the arena. He just did everything that needed doing if there wasn’t someone else to do it,” Lewis explained. She added that much of his life was spent at the fairgrounds in Salem. “He had over 50 years of community service to the fair as a volunteer, and over 40 years as a board member,” Lewis said. Carolyn said she was thankful to Representative Trey Steimel for presenting the house citation. She said the county fair would continue this year, but not without everyone remembering Noble’s work.
