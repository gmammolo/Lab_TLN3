  "text": "MADISON, Wis. (WKOW) – Students who were in high school in 2020 are getting a second chance to attend the prom they missed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAt the University of Wisconsin in Madison , senior class officers hosted a prom this year for those who originally missed theirs four years ago.\nThe majority of college students who graduate this spring were high school seniors when the pandemic hit.\nGracie Nelson, the university’s senior class president, said the senior class officers wanted to do something special for the soon-to-be graduates. They decided they wanted to give the graduating class their very own prom.\n“I think you don’t even realize how much you’ve lost until you watch, like, the freshman,” she said. “And you’re like, ‘Oh, my gosh, you didn’t get any of that.’ And so I do think that, while I’ve had the best four years and really wouldn’t change any of it, I think there’s a new excitement about graduation and events and things like this.”\nMore than 800 people got tickets to go to the event.\nCopyright 2024 WKOW via CNN Newsource.
