  "text": "FORT MADISON, Iowa — PAW Animal Shelter in Fort Madison, Iowa was recently gifted with a $750,000 matching challenge and is now launching a capital campaign to raise matching funds for a new shelter. For decades, PAW Animal Shelter has saved thousands of at-risk dogs, cats and other pets in southeastern Iowa. Now, the shelter says they've outgrown their current facility and are limited in the number of animals they're able to shelter. The shelter, which operates strictly on donations, memorials and grants, has a goal of raising $6.5 million for the new shelter. The shelter said it has already raised $5 million and just needs help raising the last $1.5 million. If community members can match the $750,000, the shelter will reach its goal. The shelter said that the new shelter would enable it to provide care to animals not only in the Fort Madison area but also in surrounding states and counties. To help the shelter in its matching challenge, donations can be sent to the shelter's Venmo address, @fortmadisonpaw. Donations can also be sent to the shelter's PayPal account, fortmadisonpaw@yahoo.com. Watch more news, weather and sports on News 8's YouTube channel",
