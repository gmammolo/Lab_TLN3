  "text": "Ludovic Franceschet will carry the Olympic flame through the streets of Paris on July 15, 11 days before the opening ceremony. Franceschet is famous for his videos highlighting his profession on social networks (nearly 500,000 subscribers, particularly on TikTok and Instagram). \"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Over 4 billion people around the world will watch this! I represent the message of cleanliness. I will not carry the flame as an agent, but as someone committed to cleanliness on the planet and peace in the world. \"I would also like there to be an Olympic truce. In any case, I never imagined that I would get to this point. I can never thank enough the people who discovered me on the networks,\" he says. \"I was called before the holidays, I exploded with joy, I even cried. I almost sat down, but being at work, if 'Saccage Paris' came on, it would have looked bad.\"",
