  "text": "Standout student athlete Chloe Bennett makes prestigious Player-of-the-Year watchlist Ninety-eight student athletes from across the country, including UST-Houston sophomore Chloe Bennett, were named to the prestigious 2024 Tucci/NFCA Division III Pitcher and Player of the Year watchlist on April 18. The list is separated into the 10 NCAA regions, with up to 15 student athletes per region. The list is compiled by the elected members of the NFCA Division III All-America Committee with one head coach representing each of the 10 NCAA regions. Click [HERE](https://nfca.org/web_docs/awards/TUCCI-NFCA-D3-Player-Pitcher-List-2024.pdf) to view watchlist. As you scroll to Region X, you'll come across Bennett’s name. Throughout the season, this standout sophomore has been a linchpin in the Celts lineup, showcasing remarkable consistency and skill. Across all 28 games played, Bennett boasts an impressive batting average of .494 and an on-base percentage of .535. She has launched 4 home runs and driven in 36 runs, resulting in a slugging percentage of .798 and a total of 78 bases earned. Bennett's performance has been nothing short of reliable, securing hits in 24 games and multiple hits in 15. Bennett's efforts haven't gone unnoticed, earning her the prestigious hitter of the week title from the SCAC in February. Beyond her offensive prowess, Bennett has excelled defensively, tallying 127 putouts as a catcher. Her contributions have been instrumental in bolstering the Celts' defense, which ranks third in strikeouts and second in hits allowed. “It is exciting that our student athletes are starting to get recognized nationally,” Softball Head Coach Angela Froboese added. “This is a well-deserved recognition for Chloe!” Voted on by the NFCA’s Division III All-American Committee, the 2024 Tucci/NFCA Player and Pitcher of the Year winners will be announced on June 7 following the conclusion of the NCAA Division III Finals. All student athletes are eligible for the end-of-the-season awards and do not have to be on this list to be considered.",
