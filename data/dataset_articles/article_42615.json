  "text": "Having grown up in Tulsa, Mayor G.T. Bynum has fond memories of going to Swan Lake in the midtown neighborhood with the same name. Located in the southeast corner of the Swan Lake Historic District, for decades the lake at 1573 Swan Drive featured a large fountain and actual swans. But after years of repairing the structure, which was erected in the 1930s, the city in 2001 declared the fountain unrepairable due to faulty plumbing and shut it down. Not long afterward, backers of the lake launched a fundraising campaign to rebuild the fountain. That effort failed, and the fountain has remained dry ever since. Bynum said this week that the inoperable fountain is symbolic to him. “The fact that that fountain hasn’t worked for a quarter century was a symbol of the city’s inability to fix problems,” Bynum told the Tulsa World during a Wednesday meeting with the paper's Editorial Board. People are also reading… Now closing in on completing his eighth and final year as mayor, Bynum said fixing the Swan Lake fountain is one of his pet projects that he hopes to see completed before he leaves office. “We will have the Swan Lake fountain operating by the end of this year,” Bynum told the Editorial Board. Tulsa Parks Director Anna America said the fountain was left inoperable for the same reasons other city needs aren’t met: The city didn’t have the money and previous administrations didn’t set it as a high enough priority for inclusion in capital improvements packages. America said Bynum made the project a priority for his administration. Funding for $1.7 million of the project was approved by voters in the November 2019 Improve Our Tulsa capital improvements package. Voters approved another $500,000 in funding for the project in the August 2023 Improve Our Tulsa capital improvements package to bring the total budget to $2.2 million. Daris Construction submitted the winning base bid of $1,871,542.50, which includes the installation of a lake aeration system, records show. America said replacing the fencing around the lake is still being considered but may not be necessary. More landscaping may be included once the lake is drained if no unexpected costs are discovered, she said. Construction at the lake began in March and is expected to be complete by the end of October. The new fountain is scheduled to be turned on by Nov. 1, with cleanup work and other miscellaneous activity complete by Thanksgiving, America said. Bynum’s mayoral term expires Dec. 2.",
