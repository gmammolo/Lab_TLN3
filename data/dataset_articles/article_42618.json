  "text": "A Huntington company that supplies auto, marine, heavy truck and industrial clients will celebrate the opening of a $110 million facility next month.\nTeijin Automotive Technologies will host a ribbon cutting for those who respond to invitations from 1 to 2 p.m. May 4, a Thursday news release said.\nTeijin Automotive compounds composite materials and then molds them into components for various industries.\nThe company broke ground in 2022 for the new plant at 2025 Progress Drive. It is expected to have 110 employees when production starts and 225 when it reaches a full work capacity. The 164,000-square-foot facility will be on a 30-acre piece of property.\nThe Indiana Economic Development Corporation offered tax credits for up to 10 years, based on total job creation, according to a fact sheet from the company.\nTeijin Automotive currently lists a facility at 1890 Riverfork Drive in Huntington. The local operation is part of an Auburn Hills, Michigan-based company with nearly 5,400 employees globally.\nDo it Best sales hit nearly $2.3 billion\nDo it Best on Thursday announced total third quarter sales of nearly $2.3 billion, a decrease of 10% over the same period during the prior year.\nThe sales decrease can be attributed to an increase in interest rates, an economic slowdown, and near-record warmth across much of the country, the company said in a news release. Fort Wayne-based Do it Best is an integrated hardware, lumber, and building materials buying cooperative in the home improvement industry.\n“We’re coming off a few very high-growth years, so it’s unsurprising to see it return to a new normal,” Do it Best president and CEO Dan Starr, said in a statement. “I also anticipate housing to recover this year and spur more growth in the coming years.”\nThe company said it is setting industry benchmarks, including a 95.4% on-time dispatch rate for its trucks, with a 92.2% on-time delivery rate. By optimizing delivery routes, Do it Best said it eliminated 1 million miles from its routes last year, resulting in substantial savings and larger member rebates.\nLast week, Do it Best announced that United Hardware, a full-line wholesale hardware distributor based in Minnesota, will merge with the cooperative.",
