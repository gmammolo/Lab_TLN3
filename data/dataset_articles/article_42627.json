  "text": "By Wwj Newsroom ,\n3 hours ago\nLANSING (WWJ) -- There are some new big cats in Michigan's capital.\nThe Potter Park Zoo has welcomed two lynx brothers from the Pittsburgh Zoo, and now they're now on view for visitors.\n\"They're pretty close to the entrance to the zoo,\" said Zookeeper Carolyn Schulte. \"They're in an exhibit that previously housed our ravens, and so they are settling in quite well. We've been watching them for about the last two weeks or so get comfortable in their exhibit and start to explore a bit more.\"\nSchulte said \"Ragnar\" and \"Rollo\" each weigh about 35 lbs., and have distinct personalities.\n\"Ragnar is a little more bold, a little more curious and comfortable with new situations,\" Schulte told told WWJ's Beth Fisher. \"He kind of takes things head on. So, he's been the one out exploring quite a bit more yesterday. I saw him resting in the shade when there are still visitors walking by.\"\n\"Our other male, Rollo, has really seemed to enjoy being in the behind-the- scenes area.\"\nSchulte said lynx are native to Canada.\nAnd while they are near-threatened in some areas, a few can be found in the wilds of our state.\n\"There are certain parts of their range where they're much more threatened or endangered, due to things like habitat loss, conflict with humans and logging,\" Schulte explained. \"So, their historic range use to be a little bit further south than it is currently. But even in Michigan we do have Canadian lynx in the Upper Peninsula.\"\nSchulte said she's not aware of the Potter Park Zoo ever having lynx before.\nApril and through Labor Day, the Potter Park Zoo is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.
