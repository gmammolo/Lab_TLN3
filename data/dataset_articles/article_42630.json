  "text": "Siouxland Habitat for Humanity announces new partnership with NAACP-Sioux City SIOUX CITY (KTIV) - Two Siouxland groups are looking forward to the future in an all-new, inclusive partnership. Siouxland Habitat for Humanity has announced a new partnership with NAACP-Sioux City to bridge the economic gap and foster racial equity in the area. Habitat for Humanity will hold a free home ownership workshop on May 1 from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. at Kingdom Ministries located at 2000 Military Road. Organizers say this workshop expands Habitat for Humanities’ audience to a broader audience and also provides new opportunities and education in the nonprofit organization’s five-county service area. A brief informational session, Q&A and community fellowship will be featured in the planned workshop. “We are joyful over this new partnership with the local chapter of the NAACP,” said Shayla Becker, executive director of Siouxland Habitat for Humanity, “We look forward to this and future endeavors with them, championing efforts to build capacity for more safe, decent and affordable homes right here in Siouxland.” Economic equity is crucial to racial equity, according to the NAACP. An inclusive economy means every resident can contribute and earn with fair access to resources and opportunities. Copyright 2024 KTIV. All rights reserved.",
