( [WHNS](https://www.foxcarolina.com/2024/04/18/missing-man-found-caught-barbed-wire-dog-stayed-by-his-side/)/Gray News) - Authorities in South Carolina say a man has been found with his dog by his side after going missing earlier this week. The Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office said Billy Kearse, 71, required medical attention after being found Thursday afternoon but said he was located safely. Kearse had been missing since early Tuesday morning. Authorities said he went walking that day with his chihuahua to go fishing when he disappeared. Deputies stated that Kearse had a tracheotomy and uses a voice box amplifier, which added to his health concerns when he was first reported missing. On Thursday, people in the neighborhood were looking for Kearse when they found a fishing tackle box. They called law enforcement, who responded to search the area with canines and drones. Deputies said they found Kearse tangled in a barbed wire fence with his dog still by his side. The 71-year-old was severely dehydrated and airlifted to Spartanburg Regional Hospital. “We are grateful for the two citizens who were aware of the search efforts to locate the missing person and notified us after locating the fishing tackle box,” Cherokee County Sheriff Steve Mueller said. “Their efforts put us in the right location and subsequently officers were successful in locating him. Now we all pray for his recovery!” Copyright 2024 WHNS via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",
