Through their dedication, Budva has experienced significant development in infrastructure, economy and environmental sustainability, laying the foundations for a bright future,\" the announcement of this list states. It is further emphasized that Mikijelj achieved significant results with a homely approach, among which, as they claim from his list, is that he \"returned the Kamenari - Lepetane ferry line to Montenegro and increased the income from it from 200 to eight million euros, raised the budget JP Morsko dobro from 4,5 to 24 million euros, built promenades on the Jaz, in Pržno, and a promenade and square in Sutomor, built the 'Velika Skela' pier in Ulcinj, and the construction of the 'Pet Danica' promenade in Herceg Novi is underway.
