  "text": "Community Action Agency holds ‘Show me the Money’event in Jackson JACKSON, Mich. (WILX) - The Community Action Agency held a free event in Jackson called “Show Me the Money” on Thursday. The event was held at the Martin Luther King Community Center to help people focus on housing, education, health and nutrition, community development, and employment. The Community Action Agency holds these kinds of events to help people from Jackson, Lenawee, and Hillsdale counties to make sure their finances and credit is in order. “What we do, we take the time and sit down and let them know first what their rights are, letting them know what’s on the report, what they can dispute and things like that,” Said Sierra Jones who’s a Housing Counselor. The agency is planning more events for this coming summer. They are also offering a class for first-time homeowners.
