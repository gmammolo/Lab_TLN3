It’s just one of the reasons Principal Matthew Salyer said putting this surprise together for them was special.\n“Its always difficult for our students who may not have a parent in the home for various reasons,” Salyer said. “To be able to reunite them, after that it was great.”\nTurner said even though it was nerve-wracking...\n“Being able to be home with my family means more than I can ever say. They are what keeps me going and what kept me going through my whole army career,” Turner said.\nTurner said he is going to soak up these next two weeks at home with all of his family before they make their next move.\nWe will continue updating this story.\nView comments",
