  "text": "NAPTIP says 68 trafficking victims rescued, 62 alleged traffickers in Akwa Ibom\nThe National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons says the agency rescued 68 victims and apprehended 62 suspected human traffickers in Akwa Ibom in 2025.\nThe Uyo zonal commander of NAPTIP, Ubong Ekwere, disclosed this on Thursday in Uyo.\nMr Ekwere said that out of the 68 victims rescued, 51 were females and 17 were males.\nHe said that five of the victims were still in their shelter, while the rest had been reunited with their families.\n“Five are still there in our shelter, which comprises two males, one female, and two babies,” Mr Ekwere said.\nMr Ekwere also disclosed that during the year under review, the command received 58 trafficking cases.\n“Out of the 58 cases, police transferred five cases to us, four from DSS, two from the Nigeria Immigration Service, and Uyo Command personally handled 47 cases,” he said.\nHe said that the command secured two convictions, while 22 cases were still pending in court and undergoing prosecution at different stages.\n“We expect to secure more convictions this year to serve as a deterrent to human traffickers in the state,” he said.\nThe zonal commander said that the command would continue to embark on aggressive sensitisation to churches, mosques, schools, and rural communities to expose the dangers of human trafficking and traffickers’ antics to the people.\nHe expressed displeasure that Akwa Ibom had been an endemic state for human trafficking.\nMr Ekwere called on state and local government authorities to join hands with NAPTIP to ensure the fight against human trafficking is won.\nHe urged parents and guardians to be vigilant, as there was a new trend of human trafficking in the state, which involved the selling of babies.\nHe stressed that it was a very serious crime against the state, and anyone caught would face the full wrath of the law.\nHe called on state and local governments to get involved in fighting the menace of human trafficking in the state, stressing that the vulnerable children were from the state and local government areas.\nHe appealed to parents and guardians to be mindful of those coming to take their young girls with the intention of greener pastures, stressing that they might end up in child labour or prostitution.\nThe zonal commander solicited support from the state government, well-meaning individuals, and organisations in the state to support the agency in the fight against human trafficking, as the federal government could not do it alone.\nThe zonal commander urged traffickers to desist from such acts, as the state and country were no longer safe for such erroneous crime.\nHe called on stakeholders to collaborate with NAPTIP to ensure human trafficking and, especially, child theft are eradicated from the state.\nHe commended sister security agencies for their partnership and collaboration in intelligence sharing to stem the nefarious activities of human trafficking.\nHe lamented that the command had no operational vehicle to move across the state’s 31 LGAs and appealed for support from the government and multinational organisations operating in Akwa Ibom.\n(NAN)\nWe have recently deactivated our website's comment provider in favour of other channels of distribution and commentary.
