  "text": "RICHMOND, Va. — Mental Health Awareness Month, observed during May, marks an important opportunity to spotlight the unique struggles many farmers face, and the resources available to help them.\nWhether someone is grappling with inflation, natural disasters, fluctuating commodity prices, changing regulations or financial hardship, farming can be a tough and stressful job. And that stress can have devastating consequences: Research has found farmers and other rural residents experience\nhigher rates of depression and substance abuse disorders than their urban counterparts.\nAdditionally,\nsuicide rates of people living in rural counties are up to 68% higher than those living in urban areas.\n“Farmers are the backbone of our nation, but their resilience can be tested by factors beyond their control,” said Matt Nuckols,\nVirginia Farm Bureau Safety Program coordinator. “They’re typically more isolated and less likely to open up about their struggles, and that’s why it’s important that we take the time to check on each other, listen and provide support.”\nFarmers also experience an\nelevated risk of heart disease from chronic stress. Prolonged high stress negatively affects physical and mental health. It can impair the ability to sleep, relax, concentrate and make decisions, all of which can endanger farm health and safety on the job.\nTo help address the farmer mental health crisis, agricultural organizations including American Farm Bureau Federation and AgriSafe have developed programs like the\nFarm State of Mind platform and the AgriStress Helpline to connect farmers with mental health resources. Topics covered include anxiety, depression, financial health, improving sleep and counseling services.\nAdditionally, AFBF and the\nFarm Family Wellness Alliance recently partnered to create Togetherall.com, a new peer-to-peer online support community that’s continuously moderated by licensed physicians and free to all American farm families. VFBF’s farm safety website also includes resources for Virginia producers, with links to a mental health first- aid course and mental health organizations. Virginia’s community service boards also can help recommend appropriate behavioral health services based on a farmer’s location.\nAnd while many challenges faced are beyond farmers’ control, healthy steps can be taken every day to cope with stress and anxiety. North Dakota State University Extension compiled a mental health wellness toolbox with 12 tools that can help farmers suffering from chronic stress symptoms reclaim control.\nChoosing at least three practical strategies to begin each day—such as exercising daily, taking breaks throughout the day to relax and recharge, and staying connected with family and friends—all can go a long way to maintaining overall wellness.\nTo view the full list of 12 mental health tools, visit\nbit.ly/4cTMA2q.",
