  "text": "RICHMOND, Va. — Eggs have nourished our ancestors for at least\n6 million years.\nLoaded with high-quality protein, fats, iron, vitamins, minerals and carotenoids, eggs present a dozen reasons to celebrate their impact, especially during National Egg Month in May.\nAmong almost 110 billion eggs produced in the U.S. annually, about 743 million are laid by\nVirginia hens, ranking the state at No. 24 in national egg production, according to the Virginia Egg Board’s 2022 Annual Report. The Virginia Poultry Federation noted annual per capita egg consumption among U.S. consumers increased from about 240 eggs in 1999 to 290 in 2019.\nVast grocery store options labeled free-range, pasture-raised or cage-free may mystify consumers as they compare prices.\nVirginia Farm Bureau Federation reported most laying hens in the U.S. are housed in large, environmentally controlled houses. Cage-free layers, as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, are housed in indoor-only, controlled environments where hens can roam within the house. Outdoor access is not required. Free-range laying hens are allowed outdoor access for 51% of their laying cycle. Pasture-raised poultry roam freely to forage the land, often in mobile structures that protect them from predators.\nMary Rapoport, consumer affairs and educational director for the\nVirginia Egg Council, recently shared egg facts and preparation tips on WTVR’s Virginia this Morning show.\n“Leave your eggs in the carton with the date,” she advised, pointing to the number 087 printed on a carton. “It’s called the Julian date—the chronological day of the year. If these eggs were laid and packaged today, day 087, and they’re good for five weeks after that.”\nAllow fresh eggs to reach room temperature before hard boiling or steaming, Rapoport said. This stops shells from cracking in hot water, makes them easier to peel and prevents a rubbery texture. Large eggs cook in about 10 minutes, and jumbos need extra time.\nImmediately drop finished eggs into ice water, and let them cool for 20 minutes to stop the cooking process.\n“And if you’ll be peeling them right away, crack them before putting them in ice water,” Rapoport noted.\nPeeled eggs will last about four days in the fridge, and unpeeled eggs are good for a week.\nEggshell colors don’t indicate nutritional value, but yolk qualities are correlated to a hen’s diet. Darker, more deeply colored yolks often come from hens that primarily forage grasses and insects.\nSee egg recipes and tips at\nvirginiaeggcouncil.org.
