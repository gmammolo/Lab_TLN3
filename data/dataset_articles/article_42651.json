  "text": "Love In the Name of Christ of Lewis County (Love INC) raised $9,000 for those in need during its Super Souper Supper benefit event on Friday, April 12. “This was a fun event where many people from Lewis County came in to support the efforts of Love Inc, a nonprofit organization, in reaching out to people in our community who find themselves in need,” Love INC stated in a news release. There were 150 guests in addition to musical performers, which included pianist Jeff Johnson pianist, guitarist Tim Franklin, the Old Time Fiddlers and the Cooks Hill worship bands. Ken Stedham, owner of Bi-Right Motors, was the auctioneer at the event. The Super Souper Supper was previously an annual fundraiser for the organization, which plans to again make it a yearly event moving forward. \"Sometimes you are in a place when you need help, and sometimes you are in a place when you can give help,\" Love INC Executive Director Melodee Bailey stated in the release. According to its website, the mission of Love INC is to mobilize local churches to “transform lives and communities in the name of Christ.” “It is such a joy to serve our community and our neighbors in need,” the nonprofit states on its website. “Through the partnership with our local church affiliates, Love in the Name of Christ is able to serve many needs and provide many referrals to our clients.” Love INC is always looking for volunteers and donors.
