  "text": "George Takei releases children’s book about his childhood in WWII camp Actor and advocate George Takei has released a children’s book detailing his experience as a child in a World War II incarceration camp in Arkansas. Key points: - Released on April 16, the book, entitled “My Lost Freedom,” was published by Crown Books for Young Readers and illustrated by Michelle Lee. - In an Instagram post on release day, [Takei](/tag/george-takei), 86, said “My Lost Freedom” is a true story based on his childhood experience during [WWII](/tag/world-war-II). He wrote, “I looked back at my own memories to help children today understand what it feels like to be treated as an enemy by your own country. This is a story of my family’s courage and the importance of staying true to yourself in the face of injustice.” The details: - The books tells the story of how Takei’s family, including his siblings and parents, were forcibly relocated from their [Los Angeles](/tag/los-angeles)home to a camp at Santa Anita racetrack in [California](/tag/california)shortly after the bombing of [Pearl Harbor](/tag/pearl-harbor). This event took place when Takei was 4 years old. - Afterward, they were permanently relocated to a camp in Rohwer, Arkansas, where they spent the entirety of the war under surveillance by the U.S. government. - Takei wrote that even as American citizens, “America saw us as the enemy simply because we looked like the people who did the bombing.” - After the war, Takei recalled how the government released people from the camp and provided them with $25 and a “one-way ticket to anywhere in the United States,” which the family used to go back to Los Angeles and start over. - The McGehee Japanese American Internment Museum, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last year with an event attended by Takei as a special guest, [noted that](https://www.thv11.com/article/entertainment/events/wwii-japanese-american-internment-museum-10-year-anniversary/91-043e1fcd-842e-494e-9c83-903605027586)around 17,000 Japanese Americans [were relocated](https://www.kark.com/news/state-news/actor-george-takei-releases-childrens-book-about-time-in-arkansas-internment-camp-during-wwii/)to two incarceration camps in Rohwer and Jerome, Arkansas, during the war.
