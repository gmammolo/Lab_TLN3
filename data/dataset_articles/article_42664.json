Key points: - Cannes announced the honor in a [press release](https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/press/press-releases/studio-ghibli-honorary-palme-d-or-of-the-77th-festival-de-cannes/)on Wednesday, highlighting the importance of the film festival’s honoring of [Studio Ghibli](/tag/studio-ghibli). - “For the first time in our history, it’s not a person but an institution that we have chosen to celebrate,” Iris Knobloch, president of the Festival de Cannes, and Thierry Frémaux, general delegate, said in a joint statement. “With Ghibli, Japanese animation stands as one of the great adventures of cinephilia, between tradition and modernity.” - The award will be given at the 77th annual [Cannes Film Festival](/tag/cannes-film-festival), which will run on May 14-25. The details: - Thanking the film festival for the honor, Studio Ghibli co-founder and producer [Toshio Suzuki](/tag/toshio-suzuki)said in a statement, “Forty years ago, Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata and I established Studio Ghibli with the desire to bring high-level, high-quality animation to children and adults of all ages. … We have truly come a long way for Studio Ghibli to become such a big organization.” - Founded in 1985 by Suzuki, [Miyazaki](https://nextshark.com/tag/hayao-miyazaki)and the late director Takahata, Studio Ghibli has garnered worldwide acclaim for its storytelling, humanistic themes and environmental commitments. - The Japanese studio is well-known for producing and releasing critically acclaimed feature animations, such as “ [My Neighbor Totoro](/tag/my-neighbor-totoro),” “ [Kiki’s Delivery Service](/tag/kikis-delivery-service),” “ [Princess Mononoke](/tag/princess-mononoke)” and “ [Howl’s Moving Castle](/tag/howls-moving-castle).” Miyazaki has also received two [Oscars](/tag/oscars)for best feature animation: “ [Spirited Away](/tag/spirited-away)” in 2002 and, [more recently](/hayao-miyazaki-not-retiring-oscar-win-boy-and-heron), “ [The Boy and the Heron](/tag/the-boy-and-the-heron).” - “The Boy and the Heron” opened to commercial success and critical acclaim.
