  "text": "Boston Dynamics' robot Atlas being billed as 'fully-electric humanoid': Watch it in action [Boston Dynamics](https://bostondynamics.com/) is back at it again with its new humanoid robot. In a [post on X](https://x.com/BostonDynamics/status/1780603212359205323), formerly known as Twitter, the engineering and robotics design company debuted the robot named ['Atlas](https://bostondynamics.com/atlas/)' in a 30 second video. Laying flat on the ground, Atlas begins to wake up. Bending its feet backwards, the humanoid stands up, twisting and turning as it makes its way to greet the cameraman. Although the robot does not have facial features, the few seconds of engagement with the cameraman can be counted as a brief conversation. Atlas then makes its way out of the frame. Joining [Spot](https://bostondynamics.com/products/spot/) and [Stretch](https://support.bostondynamics.com/s/stretch), Atlas is a new fully-electric robot that Boston Dynamics said can tackle hard tasks. [Hyundai](https://www.hyundaiusa.com/us/en) plans to invest in the engineering and robotics company to help with new testing for Atlas. The goal for humanoid is to be an improved version of the HD Atlas that will be able to lift heavier objects and improve various gripper technologies, according to the [Boston Dynamics blog post](https://bostondynamics.com/blog/electric-new-era-for-atlas/?utm_campaign=cy24q2-atlas&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social). Meet a robot dog: [Named Spirit that's being tested for space](https://www.usatoday.com/videos/tech/2024/04/11/robot-dog-spirit-tested-space/73294068007/) Dancing humanoid retires HD Atlas was a hydraulic humanoid that was recently retired. Boston Dynamics made the announcement in a hilarious [YouTube video ](https://www.google.com/search?q=hd+atlas+retired&sca_esv=09df9e42e4754873&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS1092US1092&ei=0UchZt2yLsCh5NoPl6Wn2Ao&ved=0ahUKEwid34GRlcyFAxXAEFkFHZfSCasQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=hd+atlas+retired&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiEGhkIGF0bGFzIHJldGlyZWQyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigAUidKVDpB1jEJ3ABeACQAQCYAakBoAHUD6oBBDAuMTW4AQPIAQD4AQGYAg-gAuoPwgIKEAAYsAMY1gQYR8ICBBAhGBXCAgUQIRifBcICBhAAGBYYHsICCxAAGIAEGIYDGIoFwgIFEAAYgATCAggQABgWGAoYHsICCBAAGBYYHhgPmAMAiAYBkAYIkgcEMS4xNKAHr1c&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:487a42f1,vid:-9EM5_VFlt8,st:0)on Tuesday. This humanoid is famously known for its groovy dance moves that went viral in 2020. The purpose of a humanoid robot Creating a robot that has similar features to a human will help the robot navigate our world easier, Boston Dynamics explained. Although structurally Atlas looks exactly like a human, the goal of the robot is to move more efficiently to complete a certain task. After years of research and testing, the engineering and robotics company wants Atlas to be able to complete dangerous, dirty and dull tasks in real world scenarios.
