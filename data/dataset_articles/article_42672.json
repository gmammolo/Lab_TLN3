  "text": "BREWER -- Adults and children at Downeast Horizons got their hands dirty Thursday morning as part of its Earth Day cleanup.\n\"We try to instill upon our program participants and staff that giving back to your community is a really important thing,\" said Anthony Zambrano, Executive Director for Downeast Horizons.\nParticipants got their gear ready, a nd hit the ground running to clean up the cemetery.\n\"It has been so fun to see them all be a part of the community and help pick up. The kids have seemed to have a lot of fun lugging sticks to put them in the side-by-side and being silly,\" said Bailey Gagnon, Behavioral Health Professional for Downeast Horizons.\n\"I had very much fun. It's cool but it got tiring but still fun!\" said Kaitlyn Page, a participant in the cleanup.\n\"My favorite part is everything . Just everything, but I did like cleaning up by the road,\" said Ryan Schultz, another cleanup participant.\nWhile it's nice having fun in the sun, Zambrano says there's an underlying message with Thursday's event.\n\"We're showing the public that these folks who have developmental disabilities can be productive parts of our society and give back to their society just as well as anybody else,\" said Zambrano.\nOfficials with Brewer Parks and Recreation say the extra hands are a huge help.\n\"What they do in two hours of cleanup would take a crew of four guys about two days and they don't leave a stick behind. I really appreciate the work they do,\" said D.J. Hart, Superintendent of Parks and Cemeteries for the City of Brewer.\nAnd the department surprised the crew with a billboard recognizing their work.\n Matthew Jaroncyk Reporter\nAuthor facebook Author email Follow Matthew Jaroncyk ",
