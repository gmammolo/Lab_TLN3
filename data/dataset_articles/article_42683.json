  "text": "LISTING ID: 35524\nThe owner of this highly profitable company is seeking to retire after 25 years in business. The company operates in Hudson County, New Jersey. It has numerous state licenses, a New Jersey State Medicaid contract and comes with two ambulances, six minivans and ten wheelchair vans. The company shows a Net Cash Flow of $523,000 before debt service and $417,000 after paying roughly $8,800 per month over the next 27 years owed on its PPP funding. The medical transportation business is a fragmented industry in New Jersey, served predominantly by hundreds of small, privately held companies. Growth opportunities are plentiful within the counties served either by adding vehicles or hours of operation, by accommodating the state with respect to unusual or unscheduled trips, by extending service to neighboring counties, or by expanding the services to include wheelchair and non-emergency ambulance services. Whichever service is offered, there is often a need for later hours or weekend hours. And the opportunity to grow through the absorption of smaller companies is always present. It is difficult to imagine a business sector that offers more value for its price and greater growth opportunities. For more information, contact the Broker.",
