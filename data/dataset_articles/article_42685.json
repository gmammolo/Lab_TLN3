  "text": "UKTF to Celebrate Seniors at Jim Green Invitational This Weekend\nLEXINGTON, Ky. — The University of Kentucky track and field program will celebrate senior members of the program at home this weekend as the Wildcats host the annual Jim Green Invitational on April 19-20 at the Outdoor Track & Field Complex.\nThe competition begins on Friday, April 19 at 12:30 ET with the women’s heptathlon and women’s invitational hammer throw. Running events will begin at 4:30 p.m. with the women’s 400-meter hurdles.\nSaturday’s events begin at 10:30 a.m. ET with the continuation of the women’s heptathlon and women’s discus throw. The senior day ceremony will be held at 12 p.m. ET with the men’s and women’s 4×100 meter relays to follow at 12:40 p.m.\nAdmission and parking is free for all spectators. Parking is available in the lots adjacent to the outdoor track. Please be mindful of the track parking signage for specific locations. Parking will be allowed in any lot as indicated on the parking map except the PS7 garage on Friday as the garage will be closed. Concessions and restrooms will be available.\nLive results are available on pttiming.com and the meet will not be broadcasted. The Wildcats will compete against Akron, Asbury, Bellarmine, Berea, Bowling Green, Campbellsville, Centre, Cumberlands, Eastern Kentucky, Georgetown (KY), High Point, Indiana, Kennesaw State, Kent State, Kentucky State, Louisville, Madonna, Michigan, Michigan State, Midway, Morehead State, Northern Kentucky, Notre Dame, Purdue, Transylvania, Tulane, Union (KY), Western Kentucky, and Xavier.\nThe meet recognizes University of Kentucky trailblazer Jim Green, the first African-American student-athlete at Kentucky and in the Southeastern Conference to win NCAA and SEC Championships.\nGreen was the first African American at UK to serve as co-captain on the track team and in December of 1971 became the first African American student-athlete to graduate from UK.\nDespite facing open hostility at many competitions, Green succeeded at the highest levels of collegiate sport. He was a two-time NCAA champion, winning the 60-yard dash in 1968 and 1971.\nHe earned All-American honors six times and won eight SEC individual events, including the indoor 60-yard dash (1968, 1971), outdoor 100-yard dash (1968, 1970, 1971), and outdoor 220-yard dash (1968, 1970, 1971).\nA 1971 UK graduate, Green was born in Eminence, Ky. While in high school, he excelled in football, basketball, baseball, and track. Jim broke state records in the 70-, 100-, 220- and 440-yard dashes. After high school, he committed to compete at UK in track and field.\nChampionship Outlook\nFor each individual event contested at each of the First Round sites, the top 48 declared student-athletes will be accepted into the competition. For each relay event, the top 24 declared relay teams will be accepted into the competition. Combined events (Heptathlon and Decathlon) are not contested at the First Round sites. For combined events (Heptathlon and Decathlon), the top 24 declared student-athletes in each event based on their position on the national descending-order list will be accepted directly into the Championships. The individual event student-athletes and relay teams accepted into First Round competition will be announced and posted on NCAA.com the week prior to First Round competition. The Wildcats currently have 23 student-athletes in 14 events who would qualify for the NCAA First Round.\nTFRRS Top-50 Rankings\nMen’s\n100m\n- Clinton Muunga – 10.18 – USF Alumni Invitational\n- Miles Jones – 10.20 – Battle on the Bayou\n200m\n- Kennedy Lightner – 20.30 – Tom Jones Memorial Invitational\n- Shavique Bascus – 20.62 – Tom Jones Memorial Invitational\n400m\n- Kennedy Lightner – 45.41 – Battle on the Bayou\n110mH\n- Alexander Chukwukelu – 13.78 – Battle on the Bayou\n4x100m Relay\n- Shavique Bascus, Clinton Muunga, Miles Jones, Kennedy Lightner – 38.96 – Tom Jones Memorial Invitational\n- Clinton Muunga, Shavique Bascus, Miles Jones, Troy Lane – 39.32 – USF Alumni Invitational\nPole Vault\n- Keaton Daniel – 5.67m – Tom Jones Memorial Invitational\nTriple Jump\n- Luke Brown – 16.48m – Tom Jones Memorial Invitational\nShot Put\n- Dennis Ohene-Adu – 18.94m – Battle on the Bayou\nHammer Throw\n- Logan Coles – 65.21m – Battle on the Bayou\nWomen’s\n100m\n- Victoria Perrow – 11.37 – Tom Jones Memorial Invitational\n400m\n- Jania Martin – 52.51 – Battle on the Bayou\n- Alysia Johnson – 52.63 – Battle on the Bayou\n- Onieka McAnnuff – 52.98 – Battle on the Bayou\n800m\n- Sydney Steely – 2:04.65 – Tom Jones Memorial Invitational\n100mH\n- Alexis Glasco – 13.04 – USF Alumni Invitational\n4x100m Relay\n- Morgan Davis, Oneika McAnnuff, Jania Martin, Alexis Glasco – 44.39 – USF Alumni Invitational\n- Victoria Perrow, Hannah Douglas, Jania Martin, Alexis Glasco – 44.50 – Battle on the Bayou\n4x400m Relay\n- Cha’iel Johnson, Jania Martin, Alysia Johnson, Oneika McAnnuff – 3:32.72 – Battle on the Bayou\n- Alysia Johnson, Jania Martin, Cha’iel Johnson, Hannah Douglas – 3:34.63 – USF Alumni Invitational\nHigh Jump\n- Charity Hufnagel – 1.77m – Texas Relays\nPole Vault\n- Payton Phillips – 4.25m – Battle on the Bayou\n- Kaitlyn Cain – 4.19m – Tom Jones Memorial Invitational\nHammer Throw\n- Kate Powers – 63.26m – USF Alumni Invitational\nHeptathlon\n- Charity Hufnagel – 5609 points – Texas Relays\nEvent Lineup (all info tentative and subject to change before the meet)\n|Jim Green Invitational: Friday, April 19: ALL TIMES IN EASTERN TIME|\n|Women’s Hept. 100mH||12:30 p.m.||FINAL||Julia Gunnell\n|\nAriel Pedigo\n|Women’s Hept.
