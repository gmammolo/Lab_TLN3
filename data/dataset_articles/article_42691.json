  "text": "Lifestyle Health Jenna Fischer Filmed Mean Girls with a Broken Shoulder: 'Still in Physical Therapy for It' (Exclusive) “It was the wildest experience,” the actress tells PEOPLE of hiding her injury on screen By Vanessa Etienne Vanessa Etienne Vanessa Etienne is an Emerging Content Writer-Reporter for PEOPLE. People Editorial Guidelines and Dory Jackson Dory Jackson Dory Jackson is an Associate Editor for PEOPLE's digital TV team. While at the brand, she's had the opportunity to interview a long list of celebrities, from Kate Hudson to Pierce Brosnan to Billy Porter. She has also helped recap popular TV shows like 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,' 'Sister Wives' and 'Vanderpump Rules.' The New York-based Maryland native graduated from Randolph-Macon College in May 2016 with a focus on Communication Studies and Journalism. She came to PEOPLE in March 2021 after working at a number of major news companies, including Newsweek and Us Weekly. People Editorial Guidelines Updated on April 18, 2024 05:00PM EDT Close Jenna Fischer as Ms. Heron in Mean Girls. Photo: Jojo Whilden/Paramount Jenna Fischer revealed she filmed the new Mean Girls adaptation with a broken shoulder. Speaking with PEOPLE about reuniting her castmates in the all-new AT&T Business ad, the actress opened up about injuring herself during a ski trip and having to conceal it on screen. “I shot for one day on Mean Girls, and then I didn't have to shoot for a month,” the 50-year-old tells PEOPLE. “And in that month I went on a ski trip and I fell on a sidewalk and I broke my shoulder.” “So I had to shoot the rest of the movie with a very newly broken shoulder,” says Fischer, who plays Cady Heron’s mom in the musical comedy. The Office alum says the cast and crew were kind about accommodating her injury, noting that she couldn’t really move her right arm. “If you notice in the opening shot of the movie, I'm out in the middle of a field and Cady is singing, and I have a crossbody bag on. And I'm holding my crossbody bag,” she explains. “The reason I'm doing that is because I had to take my sling off. That was serving as a sling for me.” “So if you notice in the movie I am exclusively gesturing with my left arm. It was the wildest experience,” she continues. “So a big part of my role in Mean Girls was pretending I didn't have a broken shoulder.” Dev Patel Says He Broke His Hand While Filming Monkey Man: 'My Hand Was Like an Elephant’s Foot' Jenna Fischer.

Fischer says that she’s just now able to raise her arm above her head, one year after the injury. “I'm still in physical therapy for it. I'm still rehabbing it,” she says. “It's a complicated injury, as anyone who's injured their shoulder will tell you.” Despite the broken shoulder, Fischer says that filming Mean Girls was an “amazing experience” for her and she’s thrilled that the movie has been well received. “I was so excited about the reaction to that movie because the people in that movie were so genuinely kind and wonderful and talented,” she says. “That young cast was just outstanding and it was one of those things where, when you finish shooting it, you think to yourself, ‘Gosh, I hope this movie does well because this is a good group.’ You want the good guy to win, right? So I was really rooting for it.”",
