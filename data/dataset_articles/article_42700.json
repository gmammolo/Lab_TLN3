  "text": "GALILEE — Word spread quickly of an unprecedented miracle after Jesus calmed down an angry woman simply by saying \"Peace! Be still!\"\nThe unbelievable incident occurred in the home of a local tax collector after the homeowner's wife angrily confronted her husband about a home improvement project that had not been completed, leading the carpenter from Nazareth to silence her with a few simple words.\n\"I've never seen anything like that in my life!\" said one witness. \"If I hadn't seen it for myself, I never would have believed that a woman could be calmed so easily. This could only be an act of God!\"\nReports indicated a number of people fell on their faces and began to worship Jesus after his astounding feat. \"I've seen him turn water into wine and give sight to the blind,\" said another witness, \"but this goes far beyond those miracles.\"\n\"This is as clear evidence that he's God in the flesh as we've seen. I'm sold. I believe.\"\nHis disciples were just as wowed as the rest of the crowd. \"He never ceases to amaze us,\" said Bartholomew. \"Calming an angry woman by saying ‘Peace! Be still!' takes the cake when it comes to miraculous signs.\"\nAt publishing time, Jesus's disciples had reportedly been inundated with incoming requests from other men throughout the region of Judea asking for Jesus to come to their homes and calm their wives.\n[click here](/plans)to check out all of our membership options!\nWorld, meet Travis.
