  "text": "Have a talent for naming horses? The RCMP wants to know. The Mounties’ Name the Foal contest is back, open to children 14 or younger across Canada. This time, all names must begin with the letter ‘A.’ White Rock RCMP posted about the event on X, tagging local elementary schools to alert any students who think they might know some great names for the foals born in Ontario, on a farm where horses are raised for the RCMP Musical Ride. — White Rock RCMP (@WhiteRockRCMP) [#NameTheFoal]contest is back, and we’re looking for great “A” names. Learn more and enter today! [@PeaceArchElem] [@WhiteRockLearn] [@SJPIIAcademy] [https://t.co/GmzuZPzhUR] [April 18, 2024] READ ALSO: [Surrey RCMP hosting open house during iconic Musical Ride](https://www.peacearchnews.com/community/surrey-rcmp-hosting-open-house-during-iconic-musical-ride-2881308) “We’re asking for your help in naming up to 12 of these adorable foals. Wouldn’t it be cool if one of the foals you name is part of the world-famous Musical Ride some day?” asks the [contest website](https://rcmp.ca/en/corporate-information/musical-ride/name-foal-contest). Contest participants can enter only once, live in Canada and enter by no later than April 26, 2024 at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time).
