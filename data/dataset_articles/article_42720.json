  "text": "VIR’s Son of Oak Tree continues to grow and carry legacy of its famous ancestor HALIFAX COUNTY, Va. (WDBJ) - A core piece of history is growing at the [Virginia International Raceway.](https://virnow.com/) Many people don’t tend to think about trees when they’re at a racetrack, but for VIR fans, that’s not the case. “You just knew that without that tree being on that corner, it was going to look really, really bare and a whole lot different,” said Jim Allen, owner of Southside British Cars. “So, we as a racing community all felt really bad when we knew that it was going to have to come down.” The VIR track was built around an Oak Tree in the 1950s. The 100-foot-tall, 200-year-old tree became a staple of the track with one of the corners even being named Oak Tree Turn. “It was an enormous tree. I mean, four people couldn’t wrap their arms around it,” said Allen. Then, the tree collapsed in 2013 due to its old age. “At about 5:30 in the morning that day, I got a text and it was a picture of the fallen Oak Tree,” said Connie Nyholm, Ceo of VIR. “I was like, ‘oh my God, I hope that’s not what I think it is.’ A lot of staff had already gathered and we were all tearing up.” Devastated fans wrote letters to VIR about what the tree meant to them. VIR sent part of the bark to a research center to try to clone the tree, but the efforts were unsuccessful. Then, they heard about an employee who had collected acorns from the Oak tree and planted them in his backyard. “He probably saw that some of those acorns actually did germinate. So, he gathered up some of them and, sure enough, they turned into a tree,” added Allen. A couple years later, they planted one of those saplings beside the track, where the Son of Oak Tree spread his roots. There is now a mailbox beside the tree where people can leave letters of appreciation to VIR or the Son of Oak Tree, which has grown to about 10 feet tall. “Eventually, it’s just going to be another tree. But, to us in the racing community and the VIR community, we know and cherish the fact that we were able to clone that tree and it’s out there,” explained Allen. “We have just continued to honor Oak Tree, and I think the memory lives as long as we respect it,” said Nyholm. The next race where fans will be able to leave a message for the tree is on May 17 for [Hyperfest](https://virnow.com/hyperfest/). Copyright 2024 WDBJ. All rights reserved.",
