  "text": "TUSCALOOSA, Ala. ( WBRC ) - Former Alabama head football coach Gene Stallings returned to Tuscaloosa Thursday to support and promote CHIP in for RISE over at the NorthRiver Yacht Club.\nThe RISE Center, which is part of the University of Alabama’s College of Human Environmental Sciences, serves children with disabilities and their typically developing peers. CHIP in for RISE featured a golf tournament as well as a silent auction to help raise funds.\nStallings, who finished with a 70-16-1 record while at Alabama, has been a longtime advocate for the RISE Center. He hasn’t met new head coach Kalen DeBoer just yet, but he shared some advice for the new man in charge.\n“I’d tell him not to start off the way I did,” Stallings joked. “We lost three or four games. They were all close, but we still lost them. So, I do not advise anyone that goes to Alabama to start off 0-4. Now, we finished pretty good, but we didn’t start off pretty good.”\nGet news alerts in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store or subscribe to our email newsletter here .\nCopyright 2024 WBRC.
