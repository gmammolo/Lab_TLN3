  "text": "Strategies to reduce firearm-related crimes seem to be working, with the number of guns used in homicides falling in the region, said Waterloo Regional Police Chief Mark Crowell.\nWith a report dissecting Statistics Canada’s 2024 homicide trends presented to the Waterloo Regional Police Service Board Wednesday, the service dug deeper into local numbers, showing while homicide numbers in the region have been consistent the last three years, the number involving firearms decreased from 2024 to 2025.\nIn 2024, there were five homicides, four of which involved a firearm. In 2025, there were four homicides in the region, with one involving a firearm.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW “We’re careful not to draw conclusions year over year, but within that period, it speaks to our commitment to firearms-related crime reduction. We have our crime suppression strategy, and the top category of focus is all firearms offences, including possession, use in the commission of offences and then shootings at large. Those certainly stand out to me,” Crowell said.\nAlthough the use of firearms in homicides is down, the chief added the number of shootings remains a concern, with the region consistently seeing 18 to 22 shootings annually.\nThe shooting death of Pabek Gany on Century Hill Drive in Kitchener Dec. 2 was the 17th shooting incident of 2025, eight of which resulted in injuries. At that point in 2024, there had been 21 shootings.\n“When a shooting occurs, there’s an obvious intent to harm if not kill. We have seen an increase of total weapons through the course of our investigations, so that’s why firearms-related offences is our top category of concern,” he said.\nCrowell noted part of the force’s strategy involves intervening and possibly preventing gun violence by hyper focusing on prolific offenders. As well, they rely on community-related reporting to keep an eye out for violence, which is usually tied to organized crime.\nAlso in the numbers, Crowell said, is the consistency of homicides in the region involving intimate partner violence (IPV). With one IPV homicide per year since 2020, with the exception of two in 2022, the service has proactively looked at stopping partner violence with early intervention before charges are laid and engaging with men to support them.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW “I think it speaks to different ends of the spectrum when it comes to violence in our community,” Crowell said.\n“Some of it is related to organized crime and the tentacles of what that means across different activities, but it also speaks to the intimate details of what occurs in relationships and behind closed doors. We need to attend to all of it.”\nBoard chair Ian McLean said the numbers reflecting areas of concern are important for the board as it helps them focus on where budgetary funding should be focused.\nOn the national level, the Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge census metropolitan area in 2024 had the second lowest rate of homicide victims for areas with populations greater than 500,000, coming in at 0.71 victims per 100,000 people. That was lower than both the provincial (1.75 victims per 100,000) and national (1.91 victims per 100,000) rates. The area has remained below the national rate for the last decade.\nAcross Canada, firearms accounted for more than 36 per cent of homicides in 2024, with handguns used in 56 per cent of those shootings.\nYouths accused of homicides increased from 65 in 2023 to 72 in 2024, with police also reporting 13 incidents involving multiple youths accused of homicide, five of which had three or more youth accused.\nIn 2024, 42 per cent of people accused of homicide had a record of either having committed or having been accused of previous crimes against a person, down from 47 per cent in 2023. As well, 32 per cent of those charged with homicide were under a form of justice system supervision — bail, remand, sentenced to custody or on probation.\nThere was also an increase in the number of homicide victims killed by a spouse or intimate partner, from 72 victims in 2023 to 100 victims in 2024. This represents approximately one in six homicide victims in 2024.\nONTARIO NOW NEWSLETTER Get our free new weekly newsletter Error!
