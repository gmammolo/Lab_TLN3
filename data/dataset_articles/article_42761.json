  "text": "‘I’m just a little boy from London with a big dream’ Reed Sheppard announces his next career move LEXINGTON, Ky. (WYMT) - Former North Laurel Jaguar Reed Sheppard has made the looming decision about what will be next for his promising future. Sheppard made his announcement via social media to declare for the 2024 NBA Draft. In the Ringer’s 2024 NBA Draft Guide by Kevin O’Connor, Sheppard is projected to be a top-10 pick. In [CBS Sports’ Kyle Boone’s mock draft](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/draft/mock-draft/), the North Laurel Jaguar is projected to be selected fourth overall by the Charlotte Hornets. Sheppard was a highly coveted college basketball player in his freshman season at UK where he was named the [National Freshman of the Year](https://www.wymt.com/2024/04/02/reed-sheppard-receives-nabc-national-freshman-year-honors/) and the [SEC Freshman of the Year](https://www.wymt.com/2024/03/11/reed-sheppard-named-sec-freshman-year-three-other-cats-receive-all-sec-honors/). The London native was the first player in Kentucky Basketball history to win the national honor. Sheppard averaged 12.5 points per game and reached double-figures in scoring in 21 games this past season. Sheppard’s 82 steals were the second-most in a single season in program history behind Rajon Rondo, who had 87 in 2004-05. Copyright 2024 WYMT. All rights reserved.",
