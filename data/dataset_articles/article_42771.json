  "text": "HoMie, the Melbourne-based streetwear label that supports young people affected by homelessness or hardship, has turned the traditional buy one get one free retail offer on its head with a promotional campaign developed by Town Square.\nHoMie has launched 'Give One. Get One', where for every HoMie hoodie purchased for Youth Homelessness Matters Day, fellow streetwear label Champion will donate a hoodie to a young person impacted by homelessness.\nBy transforming the 2-4-1 retail sales strategy, independent Melbourne creative agency Town Square and HoMie wants to emphasise the importance of giving before receiving.\nThe campaign is being supported across out of home, print, digital display, social and radio. An in-store activation is giving buyers the opportunity to be photographed by the professional photographer who shot the campaign images, which will then be used on HoMie social media channels.\nSteph Say from HoMie said 'Give One. Get One' is not just about selling hoodies, it's about creating a moment for the community to show solidarity for young people affected by homelessness in a meaningful, tangible way.\n\"Every purchase becomes a statement, the community coming together to give back, reminding Australia that giving isn't a chore, but something that can be cool, empowering, and, most importantly, fun,\" she said.\n\"We want to thank Town Square for their strategic creative guidance and campaign development, and Champion for their ongoing support of our mission.”\nTown Square general manager Alison Ray said it’s great to see HoMie make such a tangible difference to the lives of young people affected by homelessness.\n\"As a proudly Melbourne-based agency, it’s an honour to be part of such a great initiative for this Melbourne streetwear brand and one that ties in with our passion for tackling homelessness,\" said Ray.\nSince 2015 HoMie has supported more than 2,550 young people through its two social impact programs - The HoMie Pathway Alliance, an accredited retail education and employment program for young people (18-25) affected by homelessness or hardship and HoMie’s VIP Days, where young people are invited to shop for free HoMie garments, while enjoying haircuts, beauty services, personal care packs, and lunch with the HoMie team.\n100% of HoMie’s profits go towards achieving its mission to support young people.\nCredits:\nClient: HoMie\nCEO: Steph Say\nHoMie Co-Founder and Creative Director: Marcus Crook\nCreative Agency: Town Square\nExecutive Creative Director: Brendan Day\nArt Director: Peter Crawford\nCopywriter: Sam Nicolaci\nStrategist: Jeff Malone\nClient Lead: Alastair Langsford\nHave something to say on this?
