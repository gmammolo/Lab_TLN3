  "text": "Globally beloved, 'Queen of Tears' captivates audiences with its emotionally charged storyline, particularly teasing fans with fleeting yet cherished moments between Baek-Hong. As we eagerly await the next episode, let's delve into some of the most memorable \"couple-coded\" moments from the series. 1. A touching testament to love's limitless nature occurs when Baek Hyun Woo flies from Korea to Germany, carrying a pair of sneakers for his wife. He knows too well the pain she endures from her heels. Their heartfelt confession to each other marks a peak in their emotional journey. 2. After the Queens company goes bankrupt, Baek Hyun Woo helps his ex-wife and her family escape the relentless media by hiding in Yongduri, Chungchungnamdo. His daily drive to Yeongdeungpo, over an hour each way, is a true display of his enduring commitment. 3. Nothing shows concern more than Baek Hyun Woo speeding to his wife's side upon hearing she has fainted. This act of haste raises questions even among family, as Aunt Beomja reflects on why none of her ex-husbands could match up to such devotion. 4. Though initially reticent, Hong Hae In has made significant strides in expressing her true feelings. This evolution is poignantly showcased in a tear-jerking scene where she openly declares her love for Hyun Woo. 5. Both protagonists, celebrated for their intellect, join forces against a common foe. Together, Baek Hyun Woo and Hong Hae In craft a clever strategy to expose Eunseong's fraudulent schemes to the public, showcasing their combined wit and resourcefulness.
