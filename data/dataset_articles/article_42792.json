  "text": "Washburn invites public to celebrate 50 years for its School of Nursing TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - You’re invited to join in marking a major milestone for Washburn University. Their [School of Nursing](https://www.washburn.edu/academics/college-schools/nursing/index.html) will celebrate its 50th anniversary. Nursing Dean Dr. Jane Carpenter and Associate Professor of Nursing Lori Edwards visited Eye on NE Kansas to share the details. An open house is among several events planned throughout the year to celebrate. People will be able to tour Washburn’s mobile health clinic, see learning demonstrations and simulation labs, take part in hands-on activities for kids and enjoy a photo booth and refreshments. Carpenter said they want to honor the vital role nurses play in our community. Edwards said creating a fun atmosphere for students, alumni, staff and the community is way to recognize the milestone. The Open House & Showcase will be held 4 to 6 p.m. Friday, May 3 at Washburn’s Petro Allied Health Center. The event is free and open to the public. Donations of canned goods and personal hygiene items are encouraged. They will be used to stock the Bods Feeding Bods food and commodities pantry, which benefits Washburn and Washburn Tech students.
