  "text": "Dialogue Day honors five years of fostering inclusion, conversation TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - A Topeka coffee shop that aims to inspire conversations celebrated a milestone Thursday. Mayor Mike Padilla joined the party and presented a certificate to recognize [Dialogue Coffee House](https://www.dialoguecoffeehouse.com/)’s fifth birthday. Caitlyn Halsey founded Dialogue as a place to celebrate - and employ - people of all abilities. Five years later, they’ve grown from one location with 15 employees to a team of 50 across three shops, with a fourth set to open next month. “I think that the community is starting to see and really highlight the abilities of our staff, and to get to champion them and create authentic connection with our staff and feel those lasting relationships,” Halsey said. Dialogue partnered with [ Capper Foundation](https://www.capper.org/dialogue-coffee-house/) last year. Halsey now serves as Capper’s director of employment services. Erica Peterson has been an employee at Dialogue since they opened. She is one of their lead bakers, churning out delicious cookies, breads, muffins and other treats. \" I get to learn a lot of different skills,” she said. “(I enjoy) working with all the employees, getting to know everybody.” Dialogue’s original location is at SW 29th and Gage. They’re also open at Fellowship Bible Church, SW 10th and Urish; and in Silver Lake. Their fourth location will open in May at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas in downtown Topeka. Watch the video to see how Dialogue turned their couch red for a special Eye on NE Kansas interview. Copyright 2024 WIBW. All rights reserved.",
