Features include 15″ Turbine-style aluminum wheels, power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, power steering, an aluminum radiator, a cabin heater, an AM/FM radio, side exhaust pipes, chrome bumpers, and retractable headlights. This C2 Corvette coupe was purchased by the current owner in 2021 and is now offered on by the seller on behalf of their father with an owner’s manual, service records, and a clean Florida title in the owner’s name.\nThe fiberglass body is finished in Rally Red (974), and features include a domed hood, a driver-side mirror, a side-exit exhaust system, a retractable antenna, flip-up headlights, chrome bumpers, and fender vents.\nThe 15″ Turbine-style aluminum wheels feature knock-off spinners and are mounted with 215/65 BFGoodrich Radial T/A white-letter tires.
