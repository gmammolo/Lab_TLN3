Escucha sin anuncios y sin esperas con iVoox Premium The College Freedom Forum at UFM (CFF) is an event where students will have the opportunity to get up close with activists from around the world who have suffered serious violations of their human rights. Alongside them, visual artists, musicians, and civil society leaders will share an unforgettable experience of challenging the authoritarianism that oppresses human freedom. The event was held for the first time outside of the United States in 2016 when the conference took place at Universidad Francisco Marroquín, drawing more than eight hundred attendees and making a significant impact. Until then, only prestigious universities such as Stanford, Yale, Colorado Boulder, and Tufts had hosted their respective College Freedom Forum celebrations. At UFM, the CFF is primarily aimed at students and aims to bring the spirit and experiences of the Oslo Freedom Forum (OFF) into the classrooms. The Oslo Freedom Forum is an annual summit that brings together leaders from academia, law, business, media, politics, and social and technological entrepreneurs, with the common goal of denouncing closed and unfree societies, inspiring action through the exchange of ideas, building a vibrant international community, elevating human rights to the top of the global agenda, highlighting the work of activists and innovators, and connecting participants, collaborators, and allies. The Oslo Freedom Forum is an initiative of the Human Rights Foundation (HRF), a non-profit, independent, and non-political organization that promotes the defense of human rights globally, with an emphasis on closed societies. At the event, you will hear captivating stories of activism, narrated by the protagonists themselves. You will also have the opportunity to interact with them and contribute ideas and proposals. Likewise, you will enjoy the creativity of artists and musicians committed to the right of every human being to live in freedom.",
