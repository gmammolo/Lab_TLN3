  "text": "The role of educated mothers is crucial for the development of societies; a knowledgeable mother can easily educate and train her children well, and the home environment they create can ensure a well-educated and well-behaved family. These views were expressed by Dr Nauman Ahsan, director general of the Charter Inspection and Evaluation Committee of the Sindh Higher Education Commission. He was addressing the inaugural session of a seminar organized by the Centre of Excellence for Women’s Studies of the University of Karachi in collaboration with the KU Faculty of Law, KU Students’ Advisor Office, KU Office of Research Innovation and Commercialization, and the Sindh Higher Education Commission in connection with International Women’s Day 2024. He added that mothers maintain houses in order and have a major influence on a child, and their love and care can mould them into caring individuals or spoil their personalities. “We can witness that there is a lack of counselling, guidance, and training in the parental system in our society, and its effects are in front of us.” Ahsan said that Pakistanis break each and every rule and regulation, but as soon as they land on the soil of any other country, they are willing to obey and follow their rules without any hesitation. “We will not stand in queues and do not mind if we drive the wrong way on the streets in our motherland, but we cannot do the same in any foreign country, as we know what kind of reaction and punishment we will get there.” During his address, KU Vice Chancellor Professor Dr Khalid Mahmood Iraqi said that countries cannot be developed without promoting gender equality and empowering women. He mentioned that the money spent on the education system is not an expense but an investment for the future, and without quality education, the country cannot achieve its goals. He shared that Pakistan’s founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, called education a matter of life and death. “Unfortunately, the education sector is not among the priorities of our rulers, and as a consequence, the entire nation is suffering today.” Iraqi observed that the country need to do more work to empower women. He said that women should have the freedom to make their own decisions about their future. He remarked that women are strong pillars of society and no civilized society can be developed without them. Dr Asma Ibrahim, director of the State Bank of Pakistan Museum, said that the purpose of coming into the world is not just to live but to do something that will remind one even after they leave the world. She stressed that there is a need to deal with challenges instead of running away from them. Sharing her life experiences with the audience, she mentioned that if one decides to achieve their goal, no setback can stop them from succeeding. Professor Dr Shaista Tabassum, KU Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, said that Islam has given rights to women which are unmatched by any other society. Dr Syeda Hoorul-Ain, KU director of the Office of Research Innovation and Commercialization, said that the education of a man is only the education of an individual, but educating a woman is educating the whole family. She noted that in the country, women are progressing rapidly in the field of education. “We can progress only by empowering women. Today, women are developing their skills in every field of life.” Dr Nosheen Raza, KU students’ advisor, said that thanks to the struggle of women around the world, women’s rights and gender equality are rapidly improving, but they still face hardships in Third World countries.
