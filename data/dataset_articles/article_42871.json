  "text": "IOWA, USA — A record number of Iowa schools have claimed the Carrie Chapman Catt Award, which is given to any school that gets over 90% of its eligible students to register to vote. According to Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, 43 high schools won the award in the 2023-2024 school year. In total, approximately 3,500 students were registered to vote through the Carrie Chapman Catt initiative. More than 4,500 current 17-year-olds are registered to vote in Iowa in the fall. “We are thrilled with the record number of schools being recognized this year and the thousands of young Iowans who have registered to vote as a result of the Carrie Chapman Catt Award program,” Pate said. “It is clear that Iowa students are highly engaged and interested in the elections process, and we look forward to seeing that reflected when they head to the polls once they are eligible.” Pate's office said that students who are encouraged or taught how to register to vote in high school are more likely to vote in elections throughout their lives. Here's which schools in the greater Quad Cities region received the award: - Camanche High School - Marquette Catholic School - Prince of Peace Catholic School - Rivermont Collegiate - Wapello High School - Pleasant Valley High School - Muscatine High School",
