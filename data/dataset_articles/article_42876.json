  "text": "READING, Pa. - A major kitchen construction project is underway for Helping Harvest Fresh Food Bank.\nIt will be located on the GoggleWorks campus and will allow the food bank to expand a number of its services.\n\"What will happen here, over the next 8 months or so, is we'll put a commercial kitchen and a set of offices in this building which will allow us to create heat-and-eat ready meals for clients in Berks and Schuylkill,\" said Helping Harvest president Jay Worrall.\nWorrall says about 55% of food donations that come in are from the retail industry and sometimes they're not packaged for family use.\n\"What we'll be able to do in this space is take that kind of donation, break it down into a microwave ready meal that will be packaged frozen, and we'll be distributing those meals primarily to senior citizens in our community,\" Worrall said.\nThis will help the food bank continue to meet high demand and better serve those in need.\nWorrall says the food bank will bring on a few new employees, but the organization plans to operate the kitchen a little differently.\n\"We intend to operate by providing culinary arts skill training to people. Maybe people coming out of incarceration, or people who are unemployed, people with developmental disabilities, and it will be those people's hands who are creating these meals as they are receiving that culinary arts skills training that we hope they will take into the job market,\" explained Worrall.\nHelping Harvest expects to be able to begin cooking meals in the kitchen by the start of the new year.\n\"This will be a building that sat empty for we don't know, maybe 70 years, that will now be able to provide a variety of important services to the citizens of Berks County,\" said Worrall.\nScroll down for comments if available\nWhat others are reading...
