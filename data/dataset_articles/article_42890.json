  "text": "By Andrew Limberg ,\n2 hours ago\nPittsburgh-born Primanti Bros. has once again been named the “Coolest Thing Made in PA” after winning a bracket-style contest featuring 64 brands across the commonwealth.\nTo celebrate back-to-back championships, Primanti Bros. is offering 2-cent sandwiches all weekend long, April 19 – April 21 (after purchasing one at full price).\n“Win once - maybe it's a fluke. Win twice - and maybe we really are the coolest thing made in Pennsylvania,\" said Adam Golomb, CEO, Primanti Bros. “We’re excited to offer this awesome deal to all the fans who voted us to victory.”\nPrimanti Bros. beat out Mrs. T’s Pierogies last year and Reese’s Cups this year.\nPrimanti’s says the deal will be honored at all of their locations and is available for take out or dine-in. If you’re ordering online, use the code 2CENTS at checkout.\n“It’s really a great way for us to cap off what was a year-long celebration of our 90th Anniversary,” said Golomb. “We honored that our home state of Pennsylvania is still rooting for us.”\nThe PA Chamber will be visiting the original Primanti Bros. location in the Strip District next week to celebrate the victory.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
