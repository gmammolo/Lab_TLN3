  "text": "Hands Around the Courthouse honors champions of child abuse prevention ROCKFORD, Ill. (WIFR) - Members of the community gathered Thursday at the front entrance of the Winnebago County Criminal Justice Center to remember survivors of child abuse and recognize the improvements made to help victims of child abuse and neglect. This year, the Hands Around the Courthouse ceremony honored the 2024 Blue Bow Champion for Children Award recipient, Mary Bawinkel. “We decided for the first time to have a Blue Bow Champion for Children Award, because we did want to recognize outstanding individuals that have gone above and beyond to address child abuse in this community, who have really put their heart and soul into their work and committed to helping children that are in a tough situation,” UIC Merit Director Shannon Krueger said. In 2023, nearly 170,000 calls were made the Illinois Child Abuse Hotline. The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services reports 217 children died by abuse and 178 children died by neglect in Illinois last year. At the end of the ceremony, participants placed blue pinwheels and ribbons to honor survivors of child abuse and neglect and increase awareness around prevention efforts. April is [Child Abuse Prevention Awareness Month](https://www.childwelfare.gov/preventionmonth/).
