(WIFR) - The father of an organ donor shares how he’s able to find the positive side of what he calls the biggest tragedy he’s ever faced. John Beach’s son “John John” died at the age of 22. His son donated six major organs and dozens of tissue grafts, with parts of him living on in 22 states and three countries. “Literally its phoenix from the ashes stuff. It’s the worst tragedy of your life and then you turn around and you see all of these wonderful experiences of these people that have a new lease on life and they’re so grateful just to be here,” Gift of Hope family advocate, John Beach said. On Thursday, OSF Saint Anthony staff raised the [Gift of Hope](https://www.giftofhope.org/) flag outside its location at 5510 E. State St. honoring tissue, eye and organ donors for [National Donate Life Month](https://donatelife.net/how-you-can-help/national-observances-celebrations/). Gift of Hope pushes to save and enhance lives through organ and tissue donation. According to the [Gift of Hope website](https://www.giftofhope.org/), the organization has helped more than 10,000 organ donors and their families to save the lives of more than 26,000 organ transplant recipients. “I’ve had the good fortune to be able to meet three of my son’s organ recipients,” Gift of Hope family advocate, John Beach said. “Two of which have become family friends. So, I’ve gotten to know them as people, but I’ve also found that I’ve had people walk up to me on the street that were organ recipients – it can be very emotional at times.” OSF reports that over 5,000 people in Illinois and Indiana are currently waiting for a lifesaving transplants. In 2023, OSF Saint Anthony Medical Center oversaw the donation of 33 organs to people in need of lifesaving transplants and 29 tissue donors. A single donor can save up to 8 people through organ donations, help more than 25 people in need of skin grafts, bone and tendon grafts and even donate the gift of sight.
