And things have kind of turned around.” Although the Real Housewives of New York City alum is on the prowl, she denied that Mary-Kate Olsen’s ex-husband, Sarkozy, was one of her recent love interests. (Olsen, 37, and Sarkozy, 54, wed in 2015. The actress signed a petition for divorce in April 2020, but the proceedings were paused during the COVID-19 shutdowns. They finalized the separation in January 2021.) De Lesseps confirmed to Us that she did go “out to lunch” with Sarkozy last month, which is when she was photographed walking arm-in-arm with the French banker. “It was fun. I’ve known him for a while,” she explained, noting that their March outing to New York City’s Le Bilboquet was innocent. “It’s kind of more of a friendship.” Two months prior, the reality star sparked romance speculation with Southern Hospitality’s Bradley, 27. “We got along very well,” de Lesseps teased to Us about her connection with Bradley. “We had a good chemistry together.” Us broke the news in January that de Lesseps and Bradley were “all over each other” at NYC’s The Dream Hotel after taping an episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen together. Former ‘RHONY’ Stars: Where Are They Now? In February, Bradley denied hooking up with de Lesseps, but he did tease that he loves MILFs, calling himself the “mayor of MILF city” at his place of work, Republic Garden & Lounge. “This is the truth, me and Luann, we got a drink and hit it off,” he explained during the season 2 reunion for Southern Hospitality, which aired on February 22. “I did cross a line at the hotel, but I did not kiss her.” Bradley’s then-girlfriend, Summer House’s Danielle Olivera, was on hand for the flirty encounter in February, which took place around the time they parted ways. Olivera later claimed that she was “99 percent sure” something went on between Bradley and de Lesseps. Messiest Bravo Breakups of All Time: Summer House's Carl and Lindsay, More “Danielle was there. She was there at the show. She was there when we went out later for drinks at the hotel. And she said that she tracked him on his phone,” de Lesseps explained to Us of the rumored hookup. She confirmed that Bradley did “come over with friends for … [Patti Stanger reveals why pal Luann de Lesseps’ romance with Mary-Kate Olsen’s ‘boring’ ex-husband ‘didn’t work’](/topic/luanndelesseps/patti-stanger-reveals-why-pal-luann-de-lesseps-romance-with-mary-kate-olsen-s-/a-MSFz-PItR9qdk6boHCpa1w%3Aa%3A1944827121-a7b4abdc4a%2Fpagesix.com) He couldn’t keep up with the Countess.
