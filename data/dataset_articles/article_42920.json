Running through the airport with luggage, waiting your life away at security, and cramming into a narrow bridge for boarding is not easy or fun. But that inconvenience is magnified when people are traveling with children with disabilities. That explains why Delta Airlines pilot Capt. Erich Ries was at Gate E14 on Thursday, hours after returning from St. Lucia. “I got in very late,” Ries said. “I wasn’t going to miss this.” Ries is here for The Arc “Wings for All’ program. “I could talk for hours on it,” he said. The purpose is to make air travel accessible for everyone and focus efforts on families of people with developmental or intellectual disabilities. “My son is autistic, and I travel with him,” Ries said. “Me being a pilot, travel is very important to me.” Ries has spent the last 10 years helping the program by speaking at what amounts to a walk-through for families. It starts by having families go through security to their gate, where they go through the boarding and seating process. “You guys do way better than most of our passengers,” Ries quipped of the timely boarding process. Ries then gives parents and guardians some tips on how early to book trips, who to notify at the airline that you’ll be traveling with a special-needs child, how to make arrangements in the event of delay or cancelation, when to board, and where to sit on the plane. “I recommend getting a window seat for your child,” he adds. It only takes a matter of minutes. Parents, guardians, and children returned to the terminal almost as quickly as they took their seats. “Thank you all for coming out here today,” Ries said. “I’m so glad to be here. You guys are amazing.” Ries moves along as well, getting ready to get back to work, knowing that this grounded flight will get people where they want to go. “It absolutely works,” he said.
