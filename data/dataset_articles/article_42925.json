  "text": "College Station High School student receives Amazon Future Engineer scholarship Only 400 students across the nation were selected for this competitive scholarship. COLLEGE STATION, Texas (KBTX) - A student at College Station High School received a very special surprise Thursday when it was revealed that she was selected as an Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship winner. It was a total surprise for Cynthia Zhao when she got the news delivered to her in an Amazon box. She’ll receive up to a $40,000 scholarship to the school of her choice and a paid internship with Amazon after her freshman year of college. ”It’s so exciting to be able to give back to this community in such a way, and we know she will represent you all well wherever she lands in college,” Vickie Yakunin, Head of Community Affairs at Amazon, said. Zhao plans to study statistics at Texas A&M University and is also interested in computer science. She said receiving this scholarship is one of her biggest accomplishments. ”All the things that I learned are actually now very useful. It’s like proof that everything I did is what I should do, and all my efforts have been made,” she said. Zhao is one of only 400 students selected for this nationwide scholarship.
