  "text": "AARP Eye Center Walking was recognized by the Surgeon General of the United States of America as one of the single most important things we can do for our health. Will you join us in making health and happiness accessible for all? According to the American Heart Association, walking has the lowest dropout rate of any physical activity. Think it doesn’t do any good? Think again. Walking is low impact and easier on the joints than running. It is safe – with a doctor’s okay – for people with orthopedic ailments, heart conditions, and those who are more than 20% overweight. In addition, research has shown that you could gain two hours of life for each hour of regular exercise! That quick stroll around the block seems a little more worthwhile now, doesn’t it? [Walk with a Doc](https://walkwithadoc.org/join-a-walk/locations/winston-salem-aarp/) is a walking program for everyone interested in taking steps for a healthier lifestyle. You’ll take a few minutes to learn about a current health topic from a healthcare professional, then spend the rest of the hour enjoying a healthy walk and fun conversation. It’s a great way to get out, get active, and enjoy all the benefits that come from walking. Walk your own pace and distance. This program was started in Columbus, OH in April of 2005 by Dr. David Sabgir and has now expanded throughout the world. You don’t need any special gear and there are no special rules. Our walking groups are a safe, fun, and FREE place to get some steps, learn about health, and meet new friends.
