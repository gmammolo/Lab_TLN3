  "text": "Blake Shelton has recently confessed he never thought of Gwen Stefani to be his wife after meeting her on The Voice set in 2014. In a new interview with Entertainment Tonight, Blake recalled, “The first season Gwen was on The Voice we met [but] we really didn't talk that much.” The present couple met when Gwen had given birth to her son Apollo, whom she shared with former husband Gavin Rossdale in 2014, in addition to her two teenage sons. Reflecting on his experience with Gwen, Blake said, “If you would've told me the first season that we met that what was gonna happen, I would've been like, 'No, we actually don't even have anything to even talk about. What are you talking about?’” However, he mentioned, “It's crazy how things work out.” Blake mentioned, “He now can't imagine a life where they wouldn't have ended up together.” “When you find that life partner, that missing piece you didn't know what was missing... it's like, 'Golly, you can go ahead and kill me if this ever goes away or ends or something happens. There's no going back now,’” pointed out the musician. Elsewhere in the interview, Blake addressed his exit from the singing competition show after 23 seasons. “I miss the people. I mean, those people became like family to me, literally from the crew all up to the producers of the show. I was with them more than I was with my family... I miss that. But the job itself, I don't miss,” explained the musician. Blake dished, “I totally needed a break from that, because if I wasn't into it then it wasn't good for whoever was on my team.” “The second I started feeling like, 'Oh my gosh, I don't even remember what season this is anymore. Who are the coaches on this season?' [I knew that] I needed [to get] away from here,” he added.
