  "text": "Kilgore man ‘refuses to be victim,’ fights back against machete-armed home intruders, police say KILGORE, Texas (KLTV) - Kilgore police report an arrest resulting from a home invasion that occurred on Wednesday night. The alleged invasion happened at an apartment in the 600 block of Harris Street, according to police. When officers responded to a 911 call for help there, they learned that two teenage boys, ages 18 and 17, that the residents knew, had come to the apartment to assault one of the apartment’s residents. Police say the issued reportedly centered around a stolen nicotine vape. When the two males entered the apartment, the male resident had injuries, but “refused to be a victim,” they said. During the assault, the residence owner tried to defend her brother, and she was injured. By the time police were at the scene, the two males had fled. Gregg County Sheriff’s Office and Rusk County Sheriff’s Office deputies helped Kilgore police to create a perimeter around the suspect’s residence on Broadway. Both of the suspects were called to leave the residence, which they did, and were interviewed by officers. They were placed in custody for burglary of a habitation. Their weapon, a machete, was taken as evidence, police say, and they were booked into the Kilgore Municipal Jail. Copyright 2024 KLTV. All rights reserved.",
