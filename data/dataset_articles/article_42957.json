  "text": "Paris Gee's homecoming was a memorable one. In fact, the Burnaby soccer player scored in his debut with Vancouver FC, which was the eventual game-winner in the club's 4-1 home-opening victory over Valour FC on Sunday, April 14, in Langley. He added an assist later in the match, all while sprinting up and down the field for the full 90 minutes to lead the Eagles in passes (21) and claiming six of nine duels in the final third. Gee's efforts resulted in a trio of honours by the Canadian Premier League (CPL) — player of the match, selection to the league's Best XI and the CPL player of the week. The 29-year-old fullback's performance was backed by the cheers of nearly 100 friends and family that attended Vancouver FC's first game of 2024. His first career CPL goal came in the 47th minute, a rocket to the top corner from just outside the 18-yard box past Valour goalkeeper Jonathan Viscosi. Gee spent last season with York United FC, his third year in the CPL, where he led the club with 2,325 minutes played and was fifth in the CPL in ball possessions won with 145. The Burnaby Central Secondary 2012 grad signed a [two-year contract with Vancouver FC in January](https://www.burnabynow.com/local-news/burnabys-paris-gee-returning-home-to-play-for-vancouver-fc-8156168). Gee is back on the pitch tonight, April 18, looking to help improve the Eagles to 2-0 in their sophomore season against HFX Wanderers FC. Kick-off is scheduled for 7 p.m. at Willoughby Community Park Stadium ( [7782 200 St.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Willoughby+Community+Park/@49.1435042,-122.665691,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xc802df83f54ffe02?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj5iq__k_eDAxVbBjQIHaDABY8Q_BJ6BAhHEAA)).",
