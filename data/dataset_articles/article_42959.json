  "text": "We all recognize Mariska Hargitay for her role as Olivia Benson in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit , and while she’s been a character that has marked generations because the show has been on the air for almost 25 years, recently we were able to witness the true heroine Olivia Benson protecting children.\nThe girl mistook Mariska for a real police officer and asked for help finding her mom, and all this happened while the actress was filming an episode of Law & Order in New York last week.\nMariska Hargitay: The Real-Life Olivia Benson Mariska Hargitay , better known as Olivia Benson, briefly became a real police officer when a little girl was looking for her mother and mistook her for an officer. While filming one of the episodes of the new season of Law & Order , the little girl approached Mariska asking for help.\nWitnesses reported that the girl got separated from her mother while they were at the playground in Fort Tryon Park, and she didn’t even realize that the filming crew was in the middle of a scene, nor did she notice Mariska’s co-star Ice-T in her search for help, as she went straight to Hargitay.\nFortunately, the story had a happy ending thanks to the quick actions taken by the Law & Order team, as well as Mariska, to find the lost little girl’s mother. Thanks to Olivia, I mean Mariska, the little girl was reunited with her mother, and everything ended well. Once again, we can confirm that Olivia and Mariska Hargitay are the same , and they are heroes.",
