  "text": "Rochester, N.Y. — Students at Pinnacle School No. 35 took learning to new heights with a hands-on lesson on hot air balloons Thursday. The students got to explore the inside of a balloon and learn about how they work, what they're made of, and even got a little weather lesson as well. After the inside lesson, the group went outside to see the hot air in action. Principal Valerie Holberton said these lessons get kids excited to learn. \"That's when they learn. That's when they retain the information. When they have an experience that's real, in real time, and it's a real hot air balloon in there, it's a real basket in there,\" she said. \"It's a great opportunity to synthesize their learning in the classroom and beyond.\" Fourth-grader Mason Spraggins agrees. \"It was really great because we don't do things like this often, and hot air balloons are just really cool,\" he said. More than 2,300 students have gotten this experience across seven schools in the Rochester City School District. It's made possible through funding by the Smile Program of the Rochester Education Foundation and the REMAX Realty Group.",
