  "text": "Priyamvada Natarajan, a theoretical astrophysicist of Indian origin, has recently made a spot on the 2024 edition of Time Magazine's prestigious '100 Most Influential People.' She earned her spot for her groundbreaking work on some of the universe's greatest mysteries - blackholes.\nShe has even published a substantive body of research on the nature of black holes and their profound influence on the storied history of galaxies, from their earliest beginnings. Her books act as a guide to these ideas and are a truly fascinating summation of some of the most groundbreaking discoveries in the field of cosmology in the recent past.\nWhile Natarajan was born in Coimbatore India, her passion for cosmology led her to pursue a double major in Physics and Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). She even completed her PhD at the Institute of Astronomy and Cambridge, wherein she held the prestigious Isaac Newton studentship and was even a fellow at Trinity College, becoming the first woman in astrophysics to do so.\nCurrently, Dr. Natarajan holds the prestigious Joseph S. and Sophia S. Futon Professorship and Chair of Astronomy at Yale University. Her research has become renowned for exploring the mysteries of the 'invisible universe', a proponent of dark matter and the role that black holes play in the formation of these galaxies.\nHer book 'Mapping The Heavens', released in 2016, is an avidly engaging piece that is, most of all, accessible to anyone trying to gain an understanding of advancements in cosmology in contemporary history. Much of what astrophysicists assumed to be concrete truth about the universe, was once seen as a stagnant creation, but now understood as an ever-expanding formation growing at an accelerating pace.\nPriyamvada's writings take us through the perspective of someone at the leading forefront of this changing view on the nature of cosmology, as an astrophysicist who literally \"creates maps of invisible matter in the universe.\" Her writing even provides insight into the nature of research and how radical scientific theories come to be accepted. From the formation of black holes, the mysterious nature of the expanding universe and the echoes that remain as evidence of the Big Bang, this book is a fascinating exploration of these mysteries of astrophysics.\nUltimately, Natarajan's inclusion on Time Magazine's '100 Most Influential People' list is a testament to the kind of research she has conducted and her dedication to pushing forward the boundaries of our understanding on how the universe operates. Her work also serves as an inspiration for young women who see themselves reflected in her achievements and look to reach these milestones.",
