You have no concept of your own environment and history.\nYou label it as the elites wanting \"all the money.\" Yet, in today's western society, most live like kings even compared to historical royalty.\nHumanity is better off now than it ever was. Less violent. More spreading of wealth across the board. Just because you don't have a bunch of shit for free, doesn't mean the whole thing is shit.\nIt's people like you who prevent us from spreading our revolutionary ways to the rest of the world so the whole planet can continue to move toward liberty and prosperity.\nSharing is a natural outgrowth of prosperity. Scums like you try to rob us of our ability to share freely and then call us greedy. You are the greedy ones. That is why you are so obsessed with and fixated on other people's money.\nI saw these assholes in 1999 and they turned many good people away from activism because of their fascist violent ways.\nThe elites need you. They feed off you like a parasite. And you are so stupid to believe they have any problem with you.\nAnonymous Coward\nUser ID: 73976312\nUnited States\n08/17/2017 03:05 PM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: WTO 1999 Seattle Re-visited. 50,000 fought and suffered for all life on earth.\nQuoting:\nAnonymous Coward 1010415\n[\nlink to heliofant.com\n] November 30 1999 September 11 2001 August 21 2017\nAnonymous Coward\nUser ID: 61995349\nUnited States\n08/17/2017 10:27 PM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: WTO 1999 Seattle Re-visited. 50,000 fought and suffered for all life on earth.\n... and what did they achieve ???\nQuoting:\nMr. Predictor\nNothing.\nBut what did we get from WTO?

Area . There was a lot of murmurs about this group being briefed/trained by C I a , before arriving in Seattle\nMind you it did not help that even the peaceful protesters were unloaded on by Seattle PD before any windows smashed or fires started\nBut the groups roaming the streets that night, well picture those people now training the 18 yr old SJW's out there now\nAnonymous Coward\nUser ID: 75328508\nUnited States\n11/10/2017 05:33 PM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: WTO 1999 Seattle Re-visited. 50,000 fought and suffered for all life on earth.\n[\nlink to bilderberggroup.net\n]\nQuoting:\nAnonymous Coward 61995349\n2017 Rip Baby Boomer Generation\nAnonymous Coward\nUser ID: 75328508\nUnited States\n04/04/2018 06:28 AM\nReport Abusive Post\nReport Copyright Violation\nRe: WTO 1999 Seattle Re-visited. 50,000 fought and suffered for all life on earth.\nQuoting:\nAnonymous Coward 1010415\nThe Anomaly was there!
