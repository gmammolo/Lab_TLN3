  "text": "United Way of Southern W.Va pushing to meet $850k fundraising goal BECKLEY, [W.Va](http://w.va/). (WVVA) - After a year of intense fundraising, the United Way of Southern West Virginia in Beckley is in the final push to reach its 2023-2024 goal of $850,000. Events like Dancing With the Stars and Wonderland of Trees have helped United Way raise a large portion of those funds; however, at the beginning of April, they still had close to $75,000 left to reach their mark and the clock was ticking down. This week, the Todd and Rachel Cornett family informed United Way that they would help facilitate the last $50,000 if United Way could make it to $800,000 on their own. In just a few days, roughly $20,000 and counting has been donated. “We’ve seen what has been able to be accomplished over the last few days...and so whether it’s a dollar of ten dollars of a hundred dollars, it all counts toward going toward that goal and it all inches us forward toward reaching it,” shared Trena Dacal, Executive Director of the United Way of Southern West Virginia. Dacal tells WVVA that United Way has until April 30th to raise the remaining ten thousand dollars. If you would like to give your options to do so are listed below: 1. Donate online at [unitedwayswv.org](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=4V2MB9KN96AYE&ssrt=1713470622873) 2. Donate over the phone by calling 304-253-2111 3. Donate through the mail. Checks can be sent to 110 Croft Street, Beckley, WV 25801. According to Dacal, a large portion of the funds will go toward supplying grants to community partners in need. Roughly $380,000 has already been allocated to grants. Fundraising dollars also support the United Way’s Equal Footing Shoe Fund and its 211 info hotline. Copyright 2024 WVVA. All rights reserved.",
