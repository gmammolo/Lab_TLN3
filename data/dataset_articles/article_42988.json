  "text": "BECKLEY, W.Va . (WVVA) - Pet Supplies Plus in Beckley is holding a donation event in honor of one of their favorite rescue dogs on Saturday, April 20. After Butch was adopted, he and his mom would frequently stop in the Beckley Pet Supplies to say “hello” to the employees and to get Butch his favorite snack: cookies. Butch sadly passed away in February after a months-long battle with cancer. To honor his memory-- and help out other rescue dogs, this Saturday, Pet Supplies will be accepting food donations to feed dogs in the Must Love Dog Rescue. Employees at Pet Supplies tell WVVA that the store is going to match every single donation as they work to raise 500 pounds of food. If they pull it off, it will be the store’s biggest donation event ever. “He [Butch] was super special to us,” explained Store Team Leader Beverly Fralin. “I always say he left paw prints on the heart of the entire team...I think Butch would love that we’re giving away food, and I think that Butch would love that every dog that comes through these doors is going to get a free cookie Saturday.” Several dogs will also be available for adoption on Saturday. The event will be held from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. The Beckley Pet Supplies is located in the Cranberry Creek Shopping Center between Walmart and Sam’s Club. Copyright 2024 WVVA. All rights reserved.",
