  "text": "July 30, 1935 - January 31, 2024 Presque Isle, WI - Eleanor C. Gray (Johnson), age 88, joined her beloved husband, Charlie, in heaven on January 31, 2024. Eleanor was born July 30, 1935 to Elmer Johnson and Mildred (Hanewold) Johnson in Janesville, Wisconsin. Her family would say her death felt sudden. But after 68+ years of being inseparable, the pull of being in her eternal home with Charlie was too great.\nEleanor and Charlie were High School sweethearts, back when she was “EJ” and he was “Gunda”. Upon graduation, both attended UW – Madison. Eleanor graduated from the School of Nursing in 1956. She paused her nursing career to marry Charlie in August 1956. Their story led them on a lifetime of adventure. From marriage in 1956, to Vincenza, Italy, where Charlie was stationed in the Army, back to Janesville where they started their greatest adventure. Five kids in five years, with no disposable diapers! Eleanor balanced motherhood with a nursing career, and as great mothers do, made it all seem manageable. She was a kind and loving mom who was a strong believer in God. She was a faithful member of St. Mary’s Parish where all her children attended grade school and later, St Rita’s in Presque Isle.\nTribute Store.",
