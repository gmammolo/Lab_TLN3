  "text": "EL PASO, Texas (KFOX14/CBS4) — Seventeen adults who missed the opportunity to get their high school diploma will make good on that milestone Thursday, as the city hosts a ceremony for the Career Online High School Program's 2024 graduating class. The City of El Paso Public Libraries will celebrate Thursday the 2024 graduating class of its Career Online High School program, a fully accredited high school diploma pathway offered by Smart Horizons Career Online Education. El Paso's Interim City Manager, Cary Westin, will deliver the keynote speech at the graduation ceremony. This year, 17 students -- the oldest being 53 -- will earn their diplomas. RECOMMENDED: [Onward Ops, PenFed Foundation open mentorship program for veterans' shift to civilian life](https://kfoxtv.com/news/local/onward-ops-penfed-foundation-open-mentorship-program-veterans-shift-civilian-life-fort-bliss-el-paso-texas#?src=link) The Career Online High School program is an initiative from El Paso Public Libraries that gives students 19 years or older an opportunity to earn their high school diploma. The free, online program is largely self-directed and pairs students with an academic coach to help them navigate not only the course but also their future career goals. Since its inception in 2016, 151 students between the ages of 19 and 60 have graduated from the program, with many pursuing higher education or landing better-paying jobs as a result.
