  "text": "By Jim Maurice ,\n4 hours ago Sherburne County Sheriff’s Office ZIMMERMAN ( WJON News ) — A little girl has been found safe, and a suspect is in custody, following an Amber Alert that was issued late Wednesday night.\nThe Sherburne County Sheriff’s Office was searching for seven-year-old Brynlee Nelson of Zimmerman. They say she was last seen near the 260000 block of 13th Street West in Zimmerman. There was a black car seen following the school bus, but authorities did not know if she entered the vehicle or if it was in any way related.\nDuring the overnight, the Sherburne County Sheriff’s Office canceled the Amber Alert, saying the little girl was found safe and that a suspect was in custody. They say more details about the incident will be released later on Thursday.\nThe Zimmerman Fire Department posted on social media\nZLFD responded to a report of a missing child. We went door to door and canvassed every feasible area, but we were not alone.\nHundreds of people from our community and surrounding communities came out to help search. Some walked. Others drove. All showed up.\nCome Visit Kingston, Minnesota in Pictures photo - Jay Caldwell Kingston American Legion Meeker County Museum Kingston Bridge 1900 Meeker County Museum Kingston Bridge photo - Jay Caldwell Kingston Cemetery Meeker County Museum Kingston Church 1960s photo - Jay Caldwell Kingston Community Center photo - Jay Caldwell Former Kingston Creamery photo - Jay Caldwell Former Kingston Feed Mill Meeker County Museum Kingston Main Street early 1900s photo - Jay Caldwell Kingston Mini Mart Meeker County Museum Kingston Post Office 1899 Meeker County Museum Kingston School photo - Jay Caldwell North Fork Crow River photo - Jay Caldwell Millner Heritage Vineyard Meeker County Museum Peterson General Store",
