  "text": "Newbery Medal winner [Meg Medina's](https://www.shelf-awareness.com/theshelf/2019-01-30/meg_medina_winner_of_the_2019_newbery_medal.html) No More Señora Mimí is a tender portrayal of a significant change and is every bit as entertaining as it is heartfelt. Every morning, Mami drops Ana at señora Mimí's apartment. Today, Ana is excited because Abuela is coming to live with them. This means no more señora Mimí watching Ana while Mami is at work. Ana is thrilled that she won't need a babysitter anymore--no more \"vamos, Ana... we're almost out of time\" when Ana is tying her shoes or being told \"there's no time to play\" when there are leaves to kick on the way to school. But when classmate Tynisha points out how lucky Ana is, Ana begins to worry: Does no more babysitter mean \"no more señora Mimí?\" Ana is afraid she won't be able to tell her caregiver the best and worst parts of her day or buy peanuts with her to feed the squirrels. Luckily, señora Mimí understands and assures Ana that they will still be neighbors. Indeed, even better than that, Ana, Abuela, and señora Mimí \"can all become good friends.\" Medina ([Merci Suárez Changes Gears](https://www.shelf-awareness.com/maxshelf/2018-07-05/merci_suárez_changes_gears.html)) crafts an earnest text that unfolds in present tense and delivers a clear, compassionate storyline about dealing with change. Illustrator Brittany Cicchese (The Kitten Story) features warm brown skin tones, tons of textures, thick outlines, and vibrant yellows, blues, purples, and greens in her digital art. Cicchese depicts expressive faces and body language and uses lighter, less distinct backgrounds, keeping the visual focus on the characters. The result is a sweetly affectionate depiction of a child's deep bond with her caregiver. --Lynn Becker, reviewer, [blogger](https://www.shelf-awareness.com/ct/v/lj_QEyHTgfOB_eivm01tmFdW0DxM-nNtPZeQ09XCdpU), and children's book author",
