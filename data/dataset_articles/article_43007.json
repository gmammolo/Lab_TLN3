  "text": "Death, taxes and Tommy’s. These are the three certainties in life. Our existence on this plane is finite. There is a beginning, a middle and an end. There’s no getting out of it. And even after taking up arms over taxes, we ended up right back where we started, only ostensibly we have some say over where they go. But Tommy’s? That would be Thomas Barber Shop in the West Paces Ferry Shopping Center. Located at the corner of West Paces Ferry Road and Northside Parkway, it is celebrating 65 years in business. In ever-changing Atlanta, that is an eternity. Tommy’s is shorthand for the shop started in 1959 by Gilmer “Big Tommy” Thomas Sr. He and his wife Doris were the backbones of the west Buckhead community through the 1990s, with Thomas giving haircuts and shaves and his wife offering manicures and occasionally homemade biscuits with homemade sausage. There were six chairs, each manned by a barber. On Saturdays, customers filled every seat. A feature obituary in the daily paper called Doris Thomas the yin to her husband’s yang; he was larger than life, and she was the smiling face greeting patrons. But she held her own with a dry sense of humor. Their son, “Little Tommy,” grew up in the West Paces Ferry shop. He did his homework there after school and spent Saturday nights waxing the floors. Today, he is the “Tommy” of Thomas Barber Shop. His father passed away in 1996, and his mother in 2009. There wasn’t much out that way when Edward Shetzen built the shopping center in 1958. For a point of reference, Lenox Square opened in 1959. Saul Feldman, who owned the iconic deli Snack N’ Shop just up Northside Parkway, told a reporter that before the Department of Transportation completed the expressway in 1957, he could walk the roads in the area and not see a car for hours. According to the article, among the original tenants in Shetzen’s center were A&P, Wender & Roberts and a Texaco. Tommy’s followed shortly after and has been a Buckhead mainstay ever since. True to its roots, it is the same as it ever was. Football helmets line a shelf along one wall, and there are enough Coca-Cola bottles, signs and other tchotchkes that it serves as a time capsule of the North Avenue beverage company. There’s even a Tommy’s Coke bottle, which the company produced in honor of its 50th anniversary. Longtime Coca-Cola President Robert Woodruff and several of his successors were customers. Like any good old-fashioned barber shop, sports and politics are the constant, as evidenced by the campaign signs in the windows and the window paint a few weekends ago touting the Lovett-Westminster football game. Either Thomas or his dad has given every governor a trim going back six decades, and it’s a necessary stop on the campaign trail. When Mitt Romney was running for President, he got a haircut at Tommy’s. I grew up on the other side of Buckhead. The good fellows at the Peachtree Battle Barber Shop cut my hair until I was well out of college. But my wife Lori and I raised our family around the corner from Tommy’s. Our son loved nothing more than going to get his hair cut, especially on Saturday mornings. The barbers did a nice enough job, and I usually got to catch up with someone I knew. But for Thornton III, there was usually a donut at the end. He would look for the Krispy Kreme box the moment he walked in. I’d inspect the haircut after and pay, then he would ask me if he could have a donut. “Don’t ask me,” I’d say, nodding to Tommy. With that, he developed the soft skill of looking people in the eye, and saying please and thank you to strangers from a very young age. It’s been a spell since I’ve been in Tommy’s, but I guarantee it is unchanged.",
