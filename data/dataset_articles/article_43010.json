  "text": "New Delhi: In an effort to promote cleanliness, Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) has decided to host a food festival at a park behind Town Hall in North Delhi's Chandni Chowk from 5-9pm on Friday.According to officials, the food festival — to be held in the open area — will see the participation of several eateries from across Chandni Chowk and is expected to garner a huge footfall. Additionally, a musical festival will be organised on the stretch between Town Hall and Printing Press building. Here, classical dance and other programmes will be organised, and visitors will be simultaneously requested to keep the area neat and clean.The events are being organised as part of Swachhta Hi Sewa campaign, which was launched on Sept 17 and will conclude on Oct 2. \\\"We have already placed boards in Chandni Chowk about the festival and will light up the event site. The purpose is to motivate people to keep the area sanitised, segregate wet and dry waste in households to reduce the burden at landfills, and dump plastic and electronic waste separately,\\\" said an official.MCD said it would be a zero-waste event. No single-use plastic will be used and wet waste produced during the event will be processed by staff to make compost. \\\"Crockery and cutlery to be used at the food festival will be of recyclable material,\\\" said the official.MCD claims to be undertaking extensive cleanliness drives across all zones. \\\"The cleanliness drives mainly focus on garbage vulnerable points, which are areas prone to illegal dumping and accumulation of waste. These extensive drives involve clearing of accumulated waste, ensuring waste collection, and educating citizens about waste disposal practices. In Central zone, a mega sanitation drive was carried out in residential areas of Jangpura, Hari Nagar and Sangam Vihar. In Narela zone, a mass drive was held at 11 locations,\\\" said the official.The civic body also held three matches on Thursday and named it ‘Swachhta Premier Cricket League'. Meetings were held in weekly markets, malls and food joints to motivate people to dispose of their garbage in accordance with solid waste management norms.",
