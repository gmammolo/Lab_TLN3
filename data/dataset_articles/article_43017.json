  "text": "New Delhi [India] September 19: In the bustling heart of Delhi, Psych Therapy, founded by the highly skilled and compassionate counseling psychologist Gunjan Arya, is redefining the field of mental health with its unique, evidence-based approach to therapy. Gunjan’s vision for Psych Therapy is to create a sanctuary where individuals and couples can seek solace, healing, and empowerment in managing their mental well-being. Over the years, she has built a solid reputation in the mental health space, amassing a client base of over 500 individuals and completing 4000+ successful therapy sessions. This impressive track record is a testament to the dedication and commitment Gunjan brings to her practice.\nOne of the core pillars of Psych Therapy is the use of TEAM CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), a highly structured, outcome-focused therapy that addresses emotional challenges such as trauma, anxiety, depression, and relationship issues. TEAM CBT is known for its proven methodology, and under Gunjan’s expertise, it is used to provide transformative solutions tailored to each client's unique needs. At Psych Therapy, the therapeutic approach is not a one-size-fits-all but rather a carefully designed, individualized plan that blends TEAM CBT with other modalities like Internal Family Systems (IFS) and mindfulness techniques. This combination ensures clients experience deep, lasting healing that empowers them to overcome life’s emotional hurdles.\nGunjan’s emphasis on making therapy accessible is further evident in the hybrid model offered at Psych Therapy, where clients can choose between in-person and virtual therapy sessions. This flexibility allows individuals from diverse backgrounds, including urban professionals and couples, to seek support at their convenience. The goal is to break down the barriers to mental health care, making it accessible to those who need it the most. As Psych Therapy continues to grow, Gunjan remains committed to her long-term vision of expanding her services globally, leveraging teletherapy and online platforms to reach a wider audience.\nThrough her work, Gunjan Arya is not only providing a lifeline for those struggling with mental health issues but is also positioning herself and Psych Therapy as leaders in accessible, evidence-based therapy. Her approach, which centers around empathy, expertise, and a deep understanding of human emotions, sets Psych Therapy apart in the competitive mental health space.
