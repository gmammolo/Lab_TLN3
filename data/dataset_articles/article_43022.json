  "text": "Shepsi: unlimited energy. We received a postcard in the mail from PSE&G, offering a free service known as a “Quick Home Energy Check-up.” When you sign up for this service, an energy adviser will come to your home to offer professional tips and advice regarding the following four areas:\n“Insulation levels in walls, ceilings and attics.”\n“Air leakage around windows and doors.”\n“Overall efficiency of your heating and cooling systems, as well as water heating equipment.”\n“Lighting fixtures and appliances.”\nTwo years ago, I signed up for this check-up, and even though I was told we could participate on a yearly basis, I did not sign up the next year. Now as 2024 is beginning to wane, my husband suggested we sign up again. I thought that there would not be much difference between what was offered from one year to the next.\nDuring the course of this audit, I learned PSE&G hires a consulting company specializing in energy assessments to partner with them and perform each audit. When the multi-year contract is up, PSE&G may re-hire the same company or they may hire a different company to perform the inspections. Either way, the contract will be renegotiated, which affects the variety and quantity of the free products given to PSE&G’s home audit customers.\nFor instance, two years ago the technician could replace up to 20 bulbs with LED light bulbs. That sounds like a large amount, but if you have multiple rooms with recessed lighting, 20 bulbs will be used up quickly. In 2022, we literally walked through my home, counting aloud, “OK, let’s allot four of the 20 bulbs to the living room and two bulbs in the dining room. That makes six. Give me four in the kitchen. How many is that? Ten. I have 10 left for other parts of the house. Or should we let the other rooms be and put all 20 bulbs on the main floor? Ow! My head is hurting.”\nThis time around, there was no limit to the number of bulbs offered. Not too shabby! What’s more, our technician, Peter, brought various shades of light bulbs, such as bright white light and softer yellow, and advised us of the best type of light for each room.\nThe previous technician offered me a new water-saving shower head—just one for each home. It was a no-frills kind that attached straight to the wall, known as a “fixed shower head.” In contrast, this year we could have three shower heads installed and a choice of a fixed shower head or a hand-held sprayer. Even though we had a fixed shower head installed two years ago in the bathroom my daughter and son-in-law use when they visit, I asked Peter to install a hand-held model in that bathroom. Wasteful, uneconomical and extravagant? I think not. What mother/grandmother\nwouldn’t want to increase her family’s comfort? After all, each trip they make to visit us in New Jersey involves intense traffic, construction work, and possibly very cranky children. Every once in a while, they may ask themselves how much they really want to make the trek. We try to offer certain comforts to sweeten the pot. Nevertheless, as convenient as a hand-held shower head is, I need to state that these water-saving shower heads offer a weaker spray because the way to save money is by restricting the water flow.\nAs it turned out, the audit went beyond energy-efficient tips. In one of my bathrooms, Peter pointed out that my shower caddy, which is designed to sling directly over the fixed shower head, had accumulated too many large bottles. All the weight placed on the caddy could cause a domino effect. First, the shower valve, which is on the other side of the tiled wall, could snap, the pipe would then open and water would spew out behind the wall. Water leaking down the inside of any wall could lead to mold and mildew. Repairing the wall and mold remediation are both expensive. For peace of mind, I decided to avoid these possibilities, and I tossed this shower caddy. The next one will be placed in a safe corner.\nDid you know there may be a way for you to save energy when you go away for more than two days? It involves checking if your water heater has a box with a temperature dial attached, including a “Vac” mode, or vacation mode. Before going on a trip, the temperature dial should be moved to “Vac” and the water temperature will go down low enough to reduce the heat and thus the bill, but not low enough for the pipes to freeze in cold weather. Have you ever turned on the water in someone else’s kitchen and instantly felt scalding hot water? Many people may not know what to do to change this, but I now know. The aforementioned box on the water heater has been set too high. The temperature switch should be lowered. It is worth taking a little time to examine the dial on your water heater.\nWhile we are on the subject of water heaters, Peter advised us to replace ours before the warranty expires. No appliance is made to last anymore. In our case, he advised us not to wait until the 10th year when our warranty is up before buying a new one. A broken water heater will not merely stop making hot water, it could burst and cause a flood. Insurance does not always cover the damage. Drying out the wet floors and walls using towels and fans takes a long time, and mold and mildew may develop.\nFinally, Peter emailed us a report detailing the steps we can take to make our home more energy-efficient. These suggestions included insulating the door of our pull-down attic, weather stripping around doors and windows, keeping our windows locked when shut, and stopping the drafts that come through the ceiling from our recessed lighting. He installed all the LED bulbs that we needed, choosing the appropriate type of lighting for us. Also, he installed two hand-held shower heads. All free of charge! Maybe there is no such thing as a free lunch, but every year we can have a free energy audit.\nIf you are interested in signing up for the free Home Energy Check-up, call 855-846-2895 or visit pseg.com/QHEC .",
