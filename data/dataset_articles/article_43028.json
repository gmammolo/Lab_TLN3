  "text": "It probably can’t last very long, but [the H-Bomb](https://cardswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2024/09/Composited-color-footage-of-a-nuclear-bomb-test-stock-videocopyrightfree-stockvideo-atombom.mp4) is on proverbial fire. In the first two weeks of the season, there have been eight games with a line of 6.5 points or more and the underdog has covered in every game and won outright for direct hits in four. In Week 2, the winners were the Raiders over the Ravens, Buccaneers over the Lions and Saints over the Cowboys, while the Bengals and Bears covered against the Chiefs and Texans, respectively. Jess Root had the Bucs, so he also gets credit for a direct hit, which is the tiebreaker at the end of the season, and I had the Bears. This week has five eligible games, which includes Thursday night’s game between the Jets and Patriots: - N.Y. Jets (home) -6.5 over New England Patriots - Cleveland Browns (home) -6.5 over N.Y. Giants - Tampa Bay Buccaneers (home) -7 over Denver Broncos - San Francisco 49ers (road) -7.5 over L.A. Rams - Cincinnati (home Monday night) -7.5 over Washington Commanders Jess and I see eye-to-eye on this one as both of us are dropping the bomb on the Jets. Whatever happens, we’ll both be able to sit back and have no HBomb interest in the remainder of the games. Of course, we will watch and see if the overall perfect results will hold up.
