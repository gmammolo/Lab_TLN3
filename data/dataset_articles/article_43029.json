  "text": "The New Orleans Saints seem to have gotten multiple of their players back Thursday, including Taysom Hill, who returned to practice after a Week 2 chest injury and a DNP at Wednesday’s practice. This is good news as Dennis Allen had said yesterday his hope was to get Hill on the practice field in at least a limited capacity .\nOne day after Marshon Lattimore returned to practice, the Saints got back Hill, who is a critical component in their offense. He was used primarily in a blocking role last week but we all know what his talents truly are.\nWe will get further information when the official injury report releases later Thursday afternoon as to whether or not this was a limited practice for Hill or a full practice. The assumption would be the prior, but any status update that results in positive momentum towards him playing Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles is a great sign.\nArticles The Saints are taking a unique approach to the NFL's new kickoff format Tyrann Mathieu discusses why he's excited to come to work every day Blake Grupe ranks among the best kickers in the NFL with this advanced metric Report: Derek Carr fined $14,000 by NFL for Michael Jackson TD celebration Taliese Fuaga crowned as the NFL's best rookie through two weeks",
