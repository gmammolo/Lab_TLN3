You can just see the energy… You can just see a lot of guys, they're committed\"\n— @Mathieu_Era discusses the vibes of the Saints locker room pic.twitter.com/C8Fuebsvis\n— Saints Film Room (@SaintsFilmRoom) September 19, 2024\nTune into this one. New Orleans Saints safety Tyrann Mathieu recently joined the Richard Sherman Podcast to discuss many different talking points throughout his career in football.\nIt’s a wide-ranging conversation including last week’s Saints and Dallas Cowboys matchup, his time with the Kansas City Chiefs and LSU, what’s left for Mathieu to accomplish, and his current perspective on the Saints and how things feel in the locker room. One of the most intriguing takeaways from this interview was his viewpoint on the energy surrounding this team.\nWhen asked about the Saints and the excitement building around them, Mathieu had quite a bit to say: “It’s a beautiful thing when your team is excited to come to work every day, I don’t think every NFL team has that, maybe some fans don’t understand what I’m talking about, but ya that matters. You can see the energy, the whole energy is different.”\nBetween the Saints dropping 40-plus points on their first two opponents and head coach Dennis Allen quoting superstar rapper Kendrick Lamar after wins , the vibes couldn’t be much more different from what we’ve seen in recent years. There’s a real surge of enthusiasm in what the Saints are working on, and Mathieu sees it at the facility every day.\n“We took a lot of pride in this offseason, we had a lot of dudes show up for voluntary things, and that’s a big deal in 2024, this whole world is offering you free distractions, so it’s like, for guys to show up in 2024, that’s kind of a big deal,” Mathieu said. “You can just see a lot of guys, they’re committed. They recommitted. That’s fun to see, especially as a team captain, because I don’t necessarily have to give and ‘rah-rah’ speeches, because those don’t always work. But it’s been fun man, coming to work every day.”\nThis is especially heartening to hear from a long-time veteran who has been to a Super Bowl and won one, because he knows what winning culture looks like, and to have him see that level of energy and commitment from this roster to the vision of the New Orleans Saints, that’s special.\nArticles The Saints are taking a unique approach to the NFL's new kickoff format Taysom Hill (chest) returns to practice on Thursday after last week's injury Blake Grupe ranks among the best kickers in the NFL with this advanced metric Report: Derek Carr fined $14,000 by NFL for Michael Jackson TD celebration Taliese Fuaga crowned as the NFL's best rookie through two weeks",
