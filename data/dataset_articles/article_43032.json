  "text": "Miami Dolphins offensive tackle Terron Armstead twice exited the team’s Week 2 loss to the Buffalo Bills, but the five-time Pro Bowler told reporters Thursday that he won’t miss Week 3.\nArmstead, 33, played last week with a shoulder brace and briefly left to have it adjusted. He later went to the locker room and didn’t return to the game. On Wednesday, he was held out of practice.\nIn his place, the Dolphins relied on veteran Kendall Lamm at left tackle against the Bills. Last season, Lamm started eight games (seven at left tackle) due largely to injuries suffered by Armstead.\nKeeping Armstead in the lineup is a big boost for the Dolphins, who are set to turn to Skylar Thompson to take over at quarterback for the injured Tua Tagovailoa.\nThe Seahawks have allowed the second fewest passing yards in the NFL through the first two weeks, although it has helped that they’ve faced a pair of underwhelming pass attacks from the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots.\nThe Seattle pass rush has been led by third-year rusher Boye Mafe, who already has 15 pressures this season, per PFF.\nArticles 5 Seahawks players who could cause problems for the Dolphins in Week 3 Grant DuBose sits Thursday, 3 Dolphins limited ahead of Week 3 5 Dolphins players to watch vs. the Seahawks in Week 3\nRead all the best Dolphins coverage at The Palm Beach Post and Dolphins Wire .",
