Benoit's new album, which just hit #1 on the Billboard Blues Chart this week, is fueling excitement for their upcoming tour. Dayton's high-octane performances, combined with these recent milestones, have made him one of the most talked-about artists in outlaw country and blues right now. Jesse Dayton's Insightful Interview with Steve Earle Airs This Saturday - Jesse Dayton and Steve Earle sat down for a rare, in-depth interview that will air on SiriusXM Outlaw Country this Saturday, September 21st at 9 PM ET. The two artists, who share deep Texas roots, reflected on their careers and the musical traditions that shaped their work. For Jesse, this interview was a full-circle moment, recalling how he first saw Steve's rockabilly band perform at Antone's in Texas as a teenager and later became one of only three artists-alongside Earle and Lucinda Williams-to perform on all nine Outlaw Country Cruises. \"The interview we did on Steve's show is probably one of the more insightful conversations I've ever had,\" Dayton says. \"Steve knows the part of Texas I grew up in like the back of his hand. We talked about everything from oil rig workers blasting blues and honky tonk music, to our time around Townes Van Zandt, to the TV and film projects we've both been involved with over the years.\" The interview also hinted at possible future collaborations between Dayton and Earle. For fans of both artists, this conversation is a can't-miss event, offering a rare glimpse into the rich history of the outlaw country scene.

The tour continues through October, with Dayton teasing new collaborations and special Road Kings holiday shows set to be announced soon.to the Stage Opening for Tab Benoit on the \"I Hear Thunder\" Tour This December, Jesse Dayton will join blues legend Tab Benoit on his I Hear Thunder tour. Fresh off the release of his first new album in 13 years, Benoit's record has just reached #1 on the Billboard Blues Chart, solidifying him as one of the most respected figures in contemporary blues. Dayton, who will serve as the opening act for the tour, is excited to bring his own brand of outlaw blues to the stage alongside Benoit. \"Tab's new album is absolutely incredible, and it's an honor to be a part of this tour,\" Dayton says. \"We're going to bring it every night, and I can't wait to see how these shows unfold.\" The I Hear Thunder tour is expected to be a major highlight for blues and guitar fans, featuring Dayton's gritty energy and Benoit's signature soulful performances.
