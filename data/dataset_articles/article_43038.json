Dan Rorabaugh USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida Show Caption\nHide Caption\nJaguars LB Foye Oluokun has high praise for Bills QB Josh Allen Jacksonville Jaguars LB Foye Oluokun meets with media Tuesday, talks upcoming matchup agains Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills The Jacksonville Jaguars are hoping to claw out their first win of the 2024 season. Can they do it on Monday Night Football against the 2-0 Buffalo Bills ?\nThe Jags are 0-2 after falling flat against the Cleveland Browns last week. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence has completed just over 50% of his passes for 382 yards and just one touchdown, and while rookie receiver Brian Thomas Jr. has looked good, the rest of the offense has struggled. They might be without tight end Evan Engram , who injured his hamstring during warmups last week.\nThe Bills are continuing their Florida tour after trouncing the Miami Dolphins 31-10 last Thursday. Quarterback Josh Allen is an MVP frontrunner, and his left-hand injury didn't seem to slow him down at all. He forms a powerful tandem with running back James Cook, who scored three touchdowns last week.\nWatch Jaguars vs Bills live on Fubo (free trial)\nCan the Jaguars pull off a Monday night stunner? NFL reporters and analysts weigh in with their picks:\nUSA TODAY : Bills win Three of the four writers on the USA TODAY panel backed Buffalo. Jordan Mendoza had a final score of 30-20: \"Jacksonville is in a funk and while they should eventually shake it off, it'll be tough to do it in front of the raucous Bills mafia in primetime. James Cook has solidified himself as a star and he has another big game to help out Josh Allen.\"\nRichard Morin was the only one picking Jacksonville, predicting a 24-23 final: \"Trevor Lawrence and the Jaguars need a win, and they'll get a big one over a top AFC contender on the road.\"\nSporting News : Bills win Bill Bender picked Buffalo 30-27: \"James Cook has been a great piece in the offense with 198 total yards and three TDs. Trevor Lawrence has passed for just one TD pass through two deflating one-score losses. Jacksonville beat Buffalo 25-20 last season, and they are playing with a sense of desperation here. Josh Allen, however, will deliver in the clutch in a game that will play out a little higher than the over.\"\nVinnie Iyer picked Buffalo 24-17: \"The Bills have looked fantastic in two games with Josh Allen in total control of a more efficient, run-heavy offense and diverse passing game under Joe Brady. Their defensive weakness lies vs. the run and the middle of the field in coverage, but with the way Trevor Lawrence is looking too much downfield, they can put good pressure on him on the road. Meanwhile, Allen will get to flex his deep arm more often vs. an overwhelmed secondary.\"\nCBS Sports : Bills win Pete Prisco picked Buffalo 28-17: \"The Bills are playing with a lot of rest, while the 0-2 Jaguars are coming off two close losses. That's a big edge for the Bills, as is a home Monday night game. But the biggest edge is their defense against the Jacksonville offense, which is struggling. The Bills keep rolling.\"\nJohn Breech picked Buffalo 30-20.\nPro Football Talk : Bills win Mike Florio picked Buffalo 27-17, while Chris Simms had a 26-23 final score. \"Josh Hines-Allen needs to get after Josh Allen,\" Florio wrote. \"Even if he does, the Bills are too much to handle.\"\nNFL.com : Bills win, but with one Jaguars pick Four of the five NFL.com panel members picked Buffalo. Dan Parr predicted a 27-20 final score: \"Jacksonville has the talent to go into Buffalo and surprise the Bills, but the Jaguars are way too sloppy for me to call that shot. ... Meanwhile, the Bills look like one of the best teams in the league so far. In fact, they have the best regular-season record in the league (8-1) since Joe Brady was promoted to offensive coordinator in Week 11 of last year. These two squads seem to be operating on tracks heading in opposite directions, and while the Jaguars are desperate, I don't see things changing on Monday night.\"\nGennaro Filice was the only one to back Jacksonville, predicting a 26-22 Jaguars win.\nBleacher Report : Bills win 30-21 All eight members of Bleacher Report's panel backed Buffalo. Wes O'Donnell wrote: \"The Jags aren't going to lose forever, but getting right in Buffalo on MNF probably isn't the place to start. Jacksonville is averaging 15 points per game to start the year and has won only one game dating back to the start of last December (1-7).\"\nJaguars vs Bills game odds, spread and lines Buffalo is favored to defeat Jacksonville, according to the BetMGM NFL odds .
