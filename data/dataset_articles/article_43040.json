  "text": "With last evening’s opening night of “Guys and Dolls” looming, the show’s crew spent this past week fine-tuning the production’s scenery construction, wardrobe, lighting and sound, while the cast polished their acting, singing and dancing, and the band perfected their musical performances.\nStaged by Burbank’s Conundrum Theatre Company at Colia Productions, the company transformed the facility’s empty soundstage into a working theater complete with tiered seating for the audience before scenically enhancing the stage with sets of New York City’s Hot Box Club and Save-A-Soul Mission, and a steamy nightclub of Havana, Cuba.\n“Unlike staging a production at an actual theater, when we first came in here, we only had four walls and a light grid,” said the show’s director Spencer Scruggs. “That was both fun in that we were not constrained by a theater’s design, but also very challenging in that we literally had to create everything from nothing.”\nCrediting the production’s set designer Vega Sherman-Seitz, production manager Vicky Yvonne and choreographer Jonathan Blake Flemings for making their combined vision for the show a reality, Scruggs said his confident reliance on the team freed him up to work with his actors, singers, dancers and musicians, who were only cast in July.\n“I have really enjoyed working with this cast,” said Scruggs. “Each one of the leads has been able to bring their own distinctive characterizations into their roles–blending their own concept of who the characters are into what audiences who are familiar with the play or have seen the film have come to expect.”\nDuring a break in a rehearsal days before the show opened, the production’s principals — Carter Santos who plays Sky Masterson, Wayne Remington who takes on the role of Nathan Detroit, Bouket Fingerhut who portrays Miss Adelaide and Abhaya Krishnan-Jha who assumes the part of Sergeant Sister Sarah Brown–discussed their thoughts on the show and their characters.\n“It’s a story of the past told by people of today,” said Remington, who considers Detroit to be “a complicated guy.”\n“It’s clear that he really loves Adelaide, but it’s equally clear that he is afraid of commitment,” opined Remington, who has appeared in several community theater productions including Conundrum’s “Rent” in which he played Mark Cohen, and “Seussical the Musical” where he took on the role of the mayor of Whoville.\nFingerhut, the most experienced of the principal cast, produced Conundrum’s “Legally Blonde” and has appeared on stage in many well-known shows such as “West Side Story” and “Gypsy.”\nViewing “Guys and Dolls” as “a rom-com with heart and charm,” Fingerhut said she sees Adelaide as a woman filled with love and compassion.\n“She sees the best in people, even in those who show her their worst side,” she said.\nCarter Santos, a transplant from Rhode Island who has a commanding stage presence, has been a featured performer with Disney Cruise Line and has appeared on stage as Ren McCormack in “Footloose,” Davey in “Newsies” and Tulsa in “Gypsy.”\nHe broke out laughing when asked about playing Sky Masterson.\n“Sky is an eccentric lover boy,” he exclaimed. “He doesn’t leave Sarah for one simple reason – he loves her!”\nPlaying Sky’s love interest, Krishnan-Jha said she sees Sarah as a young woman brought up in a world where you were to never question things, especially your religion.\n“She is devout and dedicated to her religious beliefs,” said Krishnan-Jha. “However, she is also unsure about things, and the more she grows and blossoms, the more her beliefs are challenged, especially during her time in Havana,” she added with a sly smile.\nWhile she sees a bit of herself in Sarah, Krishnan-Jha said she is thankful that the director and producer were not bound by traditional typecasting.\n“I would not be the archetypal type to be cast in the role of Sarah,” said Krishnan-Jha, a software engineer. “I never thought I would get to play an ingénue. That is why I read the script and auditioned before watching the movie. I didn’t want to have any preconceived thoughts that would get in the way of my interpretation of who Sarah is.”\nA classic musical that debuted on Broadway 74 years ago, most people today are familiar with “Guys and Dolls” from the 1955 MGM film that starred Marlon Brando, Jean Simmons, Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine.\nThe story, adapted from the 1930s writings of Damon Runyon, was brought to the stage by playwrights Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows. With music and lyrics by Frank Loesser, the musical score is considered one of the most beloved in the history of American theatre.\nThe show takes place in New York sometime between the two World Wars. In true Runyonesque style, it takes audiences into a world of sinners and saints, from the gangsters and gamblers of the streets and the showgirls of the Hot Box Club to the missionaries of the Save-A-Soul Mission.\n“My style is to direct from a perspective of relationships,” Scruggs said during a rehearsal break. “My goal is to have my cast develop their characters through the relationships they have with themselves, their characters, with the other characters and with a moment in time.”\nAlthough the characters may be dated by their distinctive dialogue and wardrobe (beautifully crafted for this production by costume designer Morgan Cordova-Stuart), the show’s theme–that it’s impossible for anyone to be happy living in a world dominated by extremist thinking–is, perhaps, more relevant in today’s polarized world than it was when the play first hit the boards.\n“Guys and Dolls” will run tonight and tomorrow night, and then next Friday, Saturday and Sunday at Colia Productions, 1208 West Isabel Street Burbank. There is free self-parking and wheelchair accessibility. Tickets are $30 for general admission and $40 and $45 for preferred seating, which includes sitting at tables on the stage, a 30-minute immersive pre-show and exclusive commemorative merchandise. The show includes mild swearing, alcohol consumption and gambling.\nFor tickets or more information on the Conundrum Theatre Company, their upcoming productions, auditions and contribution and sponsorship opportunities, visit\nwww.conundrumtheatreco.com.\nDAVID LAURELL may be reached by email at or (818) 563-1007.",
