  "text": "The Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke, has thrown his weight behind the resolution made by governors elected on the platform of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP to remove the acting National Chairman of the party, Umar Damagum.\nDAILY POST recalls that the PDP Governors’ Forum had declared that Damagum would be removed to pave the way for a North Central member as enshrined in the party’s constitution.\nAccording to them, a North Central member should have replaced the former national chairman, Iyorchia Ayu who was sacked in 2022.\nThe decision has, however, deepened the party’s leadership crisis as some governors declared their support for Damagum.\nStating his position, Governor Adeleke in a statement issued on Thursday by his spokesperson, Mallam Olawale Rasheed, said he stands “by the resolution of the PDP Governors’ Forum of which I am an integral part”.\n“I stand by the Constitution of our great party which clearly spelt out the succession procedure in case of the exit of an elected chairman.\n“Our party must adhere to its Constitution at this critical time and at all times. That is the way to build a responsible political party”, he said.",
