  "text": "The defeat of the men and the victory of the ladies marked the eighth round of the 45th Chess Olympiad in Budapest. Our Psahists suffered their third defeat, with five victories, after today Turkey was better 2:5:1,5. Our chess players can regret the missed opportunities in today's duel, and the lack of sporting luck brought defeat in the duel with an exceptional opponent. Our front board, Denis Kadric, once again demonstrated his excellent knowledge of the Italian defense, and after a tactical strike in the fifteenth move, he gained a significantly better position, which he converted into a full point with precise play, his fifth in eight rounds. Current national champion Nikita Petrov, in an equal position, allowed the initiative to pass to sixteen-year-old Ediz Gurel, and the young Turkish chess player took advantage of Petrov's indiscretions and won. At that moment, the duels between Nikola Đukić and Luka Drašković remained to be played. Đukić allowed his opponent, the thirteen-year-old child prodigy and grandmaster Džagiz Kan Erdogmus, to occupy the space in the game, who then gained a full point with precise play. The game between Luka Drašković and Emre Kan, after a great fight, ended in a draw, which set the final result of the match. Our ladies registered their fifth victory in the tournament, defeating the Algerian team with 2,5:1,5. First, the game ended on the third board between Aleksandra Milović and Zineb Dina Abdi, who agreed on a draw after a mutually accurate game. Nikolina Koljević skilfully used the advantage gained in the opening and brought our team into the lead, defeating Rania Nasr. With the precise game of Aleksandra Žerebecova, she registered her sixth victory in the tournament, so our team got two new points, which was not prevented even by the defeat of Alena Skvorcova on the second board. After eight rounds, both our selections have 10 points each, i.e. five wins and three losses. There are three more rounds remaining, in which our teams will look for a chance for new victories. After eight rounds, the Indian national team is in the lead in both competitions, which has the maximum performance in the men's competition, while Poland is tied for first place with India in the women's competition, so the possibility that both winning cups will travel to the cradle of the ancient game seems more and more certain. The ninth round is on the program tomorrow from 15 p.m. Bonus video:",
