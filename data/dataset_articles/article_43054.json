  "text": "ZDNET's key takeaways are bone-conduction headphones that sell for $159 a pair on Amazon.They're much more comfortable to wear during runs, and controlling audio playback is much easier.However, you will have to get used to the unique form factor and come to terms with the fact that they won't completely block out surrounding noise.I've been using bone conduction headphones for about ten years now. I started using them after going through countless pairs of traditional headphones that simply could not take the sweat or the constant movement, ruining the wire connections. Also: Why I ditched my bone conduction headphones for these 'wired' earbuds - and don't regret itOn top of all that, earbuds rarely stay in my ears when I'm running. The last thing I need is to lose an expensive pair of earbuds when physics gets the best of the tiny technology and gravity takes the earbud for a crash landing on the pavement. I recently started testing a Mojawa pair that resembles my favorite Shokz Open Run Pros. Since then, it's safe to say the have become my new go-to bone conduction headphones. Here's why. The tech specsBattery: 150mAh Li-Polymer with a charge time of 50 minutes and 8 hours of playtime.Dual suspension anchor system for deeper/more resonant bass.Voice assistant: YesFrequency response: 20Hz-20KHzSensitivity: 110dB+/- 5dBBluetooth version: 5.2MP3 Storage: 32GBEQ: YesWaterproof: IP68Weight: 29.7gCost: $159Obviously, some of the features (such as EQ and MP3 Storage) require a third-party app. I generally don't install such apps (because I prefer security and privacy over added features), so I haven't bothered with the EQ or the MP3 storage. That's fine, as I don't need those options. Why? Bone-conducting headphones can only sound so good, and I always run on my phone. The first runI'm not going to lie. The first run wasn't exactly a spectacular outing. However, the initial impression of the hardware itself was impressive. One complaint I've had (for the longest time) about the Shokz headphones: The button to pause and skip songs is tiny. Even worse, getting the double-click right to skip a song can be challenging. Double-click too quickly, and it registers as a single click. I've always had problems with that Open Run Pro button.The Mojawa Run Plus solves that problem completely. With a much bigger button on the left side of the headphones, pausing (one click), skipping (two clicks), or replaying (three clicks) a song is effortless. Also: One of the best budget earbuds I've tested can make everything sound goodThe Mojawa takes the UX even further by adding a touch \"slider\" on the right side of the headphones. Swipe up to increase the volume, and swipe down to decrease it. Unlike the Shokz, which uses two small physical buttons on the underside of the right side of the device to change volume, the Mojawa makes increasing/decreasing the sound very easy.The first run outing was less than spectacular because I had trouble with the sound. The sound was far too soft, and no matter how many times I swiped up on the touchpad, it wouldn't increase. That's problematic for bone-conducting headphones because your ears are wide open, and the ambient sound can easily drown out the music.Also: The best bone conduction headphones you can buy: Expert testedFortunately, the ensuing runs didn't suffer from that issue. I'm not sure if it was a Spotify or Android issue, but they sounded considerably louder the next time I went to test the Mojawa Run Plus. In fact, I would easily place them on par with the (which are the best bone-conducting headphones I've tried).Should you buy AirPods instead?Now, you may be wondering: should you get the Run Plus or a pair of AirPods for the gym? The AirPods 4 are launching on September 20, so it's a good time to snag a pair. If you're going to be doing a lot of cardio, get the Mojawa headphones. Their design ensures the pair grip your ears with no chance of ever falling off. Plus, the open design of Run Plus allows you to hold conversations with your gym buddies, and you don't have to take them off.AirPods deliver great audio output, but aren't really meant for exercise. Apple's pair have an water resistance rating of IP54 allowing them to survive splashes of water or sweat. Mojawa's pair have a higher rating of IP68, meaning you can take them in the pool with you and they'll be fine.Also: I've used my AirPods Pro 2 since their 2022 release. Are they still worth it in 2024?These headphones have supplanted my Shokz Open Run Pros for the time being. We'll see if longevity is on the side of the Run Plus (as Shokz headphones tend to go the distance). If so, these headphones will come with my highest recommendation for active people looking for headphones that can tolerate sweat, water, and the typical beating that exercise inflicts on such technology.ZDNET's buying adviceNot everyone can get accustomed to bone-conducting headphones. I've had friends and family who tried them (on my recommendation), and a handful of people have come back to say they didn't like how they felt on their heads. Everyone else loved them.Who benefits from the ? These are for you if you regularly exercise and produce considerable sweat (and aren't concerned about the best sound possible). Also, if you find the to be challenging to control, the Mojawa will make you very happy.",
