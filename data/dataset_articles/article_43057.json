  "text": "When I was told a week ago that I would be thrown around like a ragdoll in a tiny plane my stomach turned, writes SunLive reporter Ayla Yeoman. Ayla recently went up io a CT4 adventure flight, curtesy of Classic Flyers in Mount Maunganui. She shares her experience with readers below. I’m not a fan of heights and I don’t think anyone who knew me would describe me as an “adrenaline junkie”. In fact, my mind is riddled with anxiety at the thought of doing things kinds of things. For those who have watched the classic movie Top Gun, you probably think spinning around in a tiny plane doing somersaults wouldn’t be too bad; might actually be fun. I’ve never been one to get motion sickness, but this is a whole different level. I started to worry about the worst-case scenario, looking out at Mount Maunganui while plummeting into the ocean. Anyway, enough of the doom and gloom because now it’s time to get into that tiny plane and figure out why on God’s green earth we came up with the idea to leave the perfectly safe ground. Arriving at the hangar When I arrived at the hangar, I was introduced to some of the top pilots at Classic Flyers. The pilot who would be flying my plane Keith Adair – or “Santa” – has more than 22,000 hours under his belt. Adair is an ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force helicopter and fixed wing instructor. He’s also an ex-Air New Zealand pilot. Adair is also an ex-member of the Red Checkers aerobatic, precision flying team of the RNZAF. Now retired, Adair enjoys taking people on adventure flights around the sunny BOP. The other plane flying beside us would be flown by pilot Pete McCombe. McCombe is an Air NZ captain, a Classic Flyers pilot and an aerobatic warbird pilot and instructor. He has 26 years of experience. Nick Rowe is another pilot overseeing the operation. Rowe has 30 years of flying experience and is currently an Air NZ Boeing pilot. He is also an aerobatic Warbirds instructor, a flight examiner and the Classic Flyers chief instructor. Though I was nervous, these pilots made me feel completely safe, I knew I could trust every single one of them. I’m glad that was the case because I was about to put my life into their hands.

But this particular plane – a CT4B Airtrainer - is new to the adventure flight experience. The Pacific Aerospace Corporation CT4B Airtrainer is an ex-RNZAF training plane with side-by-side seating for instructors to teach the trainees. The Airtrainer is from 1976, meaning it’s around 48 years old. But don’t worry, it flies like it’s brand new. Classic Flyers is the only place to get this experience as it’s the only plane of its kind in New Zealand offering rides to the public. The Airtrainer is a basic training aircraft manufactured in Hamilton – not sure if I should be relieved or worried about that fact. It’s a single-engine, fully aerobatic, piston-engine aircraft with a top speed of about 380km/h. But trust me, it feels a lot faster. There’s only three left in the country and this is the only one being used for commercial reasons. An adventure flight like this with aerobatics and g-forces has been described by the pilots as a blend between a rollercoaster and a simulator. This experience is for those over 12 years old. Adair has even flown with a 97-year-old. Fellow pilot Nick Rowe said: “You can’t describe it, it has to be experienced.” So that’s what I did.

While I was excited, this is when the nerves really started to kick in. After the briefing we walked out of the hangar to the planes and jumped in. Another briefing was given to me by Adair about the harness, headset and radio and safety procedures. I was shown how to open the canopy and where the fire extinguisher and first aid kit was. This was also when Adair mentioned what we would need to do if the engine failed while we were taking off. Eek! We shut the canopy and took off.

The logs at the port looked smaller than toothpicks and the ships coming in and out of the port looked like children’s toys. The flight was scenic-style for the first half and the views were truly incredible. We went around Mauao, past Matakana Island and even down by the Mount golf course. Needless to say, the Bay of Plenty is very photogenic. SunLive reporter Ayla Yeoman with pilot Keith Adair on the Classic Flyers CT4 Adventure Flight. Photo: John Borren. Then came the second half of the flight. The part that made my stomach turn at the thought of it. Adair told me the plan, barrel roll, side to side, honestly, I wasn’t really listening. All I could think about was projectile vomiting over all the hundreds of buttons and switches in front of me. There was no going back now. Adair told me to brace myself when we’d experience g-forces, and we were away. We ended up going over four gs of force at some point on the flight.

Yes, including the one where you go upside down. We did loops, turns, flips, spins – as you can tell I’m not sure what the “technical” terms are. We also did something I didn’t even realise you could do in a plane like this. We experienced zero gravity. Yes, like in space. We’d take off high into the air, pause and Adair would temporarily switch off the engine and everything would go quiet as we floated in the cabin for a few seconds, then the engine would be switched back on and we’d be away again. If you think that sounds cool, then triple it. Nothing can come close to this experience. It’s an opportunity of a lifetime, hanging upside down looking at the ocean below you.

It’s more peaceful than a rollercoaster and more freeing. In some parts like when you’re doing dips side to side, it’s like being on a swing. You go up, there’s a pause, then you go down. You’re dancing with g-forces. Landed Sooner than I had hoped we landed and did the final briefing and safety checks. The pilots started talking about how they wanted to get more footage of the Airtrainer doing aerobatics. They looked at me and asked if I wanted to go again – possibly out of sarcasm. Before I knew it, I had said yes. It’s that addictive. This opportunity is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and it’s not one that you want to brush off easily because it seems “scary”. Yes, it’s terrifying, but that’s the point. This adrenaline-spiking, heart-pounding, mind-blowing experience can’t be missed. You’ll never feel more alive. Classic Flyers is the only place that offers this experience in New Zealand.
