  "text": "By Jacqueline Burt Cote ,\n3 hours ago\nWhen Melissa McCarthy took to Instagram to wish Spy director Paul Feig a happy birthday, she probably wasn't expecting to trigger a widespread outcry for a sequel to the 2015 comedy—but that's exactly what happened.\nOn Wednesday, Sept. 18, the 54-year-old actress shared a behind-the-scenes photo from the set of Spy to celebrate Feig's birthday. In the pic, McCarthy posed next to the director dressed as one of her character Susan Cooper's identities, wearing a high-waisted red skirt and a short, bouffant wig.\n\"Happy Birthday to one of my favorite guys!\" McCarthy captioned her post.\nRelated: Melissa McCarthy Makes a Bold Declaration About Meghan Markle Critics\nIn the comments, fans took the opportunity to beg the actress to make a sequel to the popular flick.\n\"Happy Birthday to the best dressed man! ❤ We want another SPY!! 😍🕵️\" wrote one person.\n\"Yeah.. we need a spy 2😌,\" agreed a second Instagram user, with someone else simply writing, \"Spy 2, please!\"\nCo-starring Jude Law and Rose Byrne , Spy saw McCarthy as a CIA analyst on her first undercover mission and has become a fan favorite among McCarthy supporters. But Spy isn't the only film directed by Feig and starring McCarthy that viewers wish they would revisit as moviegoers have also expressed their desire for a follow-up to the 2011 hit Bridesmaids .\nUnfortunately, Bridesmaids star (and screenplay co-writer) Kristen Wiig told The Hollywood Reporter that she is \"decidedly uninterested\" in making a sequel.\n\"That story had an end, and it’s so beloved to me for 10 million reasons, and I think it’s OK to just have it exist in the world as it is,\" the Palm Royale star said.\nNext: Melissa McCarthy Shares Her Weight Loss Journey\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
