  "text": "Walking into Bob Kimball’s Absarokee Fly Shop is almost like stepping back in time. Instead of glitzy display racks of gear with photos of anglers and big fish, customers are walking into the 90-year-old’s home. He started the business at the urging of a friend. In the summer, he sells flies off the home’s porch, all for the same price. Inside, Kimball has an office where he also builds fishing rods on request. Although he’s been fly fishing for years, Kimball is not a lunker hunter. Instead, for him fishing is all about finding a small stream with no one around and connecting with nature and God. The size of the fish isn’t as important as the spiritual experience. To learn more about Bob, check out my story at https://billingsgazette.com/outdoors/bob-kimball-fly-fishing-absarokee-rod-building/article_aeebe484-714e-11ef-ab16-17b1479c571c.html\nGrand Canyon Boasts Epic Views and Real Risks with 16 deaths in 2024\nBy angelamontana\nHunting Under Fire: Oregon’s Spring Bear Season in the Crosshairs\nONLY ONE FISH SPECIES ALLOWED!!! by Montana Grant\nGovernor Gianforte Launches Third Annual Youth Hunting Story Contest\nBy Moosetrack Megan\nFlathead National Forest seeks public input on North and Middle Forks River outfitting and guiding permit reauthorization\nWoman sustains thermal burns in Yellowstone National Park\nFWP News: FWP looks for information on illegal killed bull elk in HD 380\nSuper simple and Easy Walleye Chowder Recipe\nReward offered after robbery of Missoula gun store\nWhich elk organs to keep and eat with Randy Newberg\nMORE BEARS BITE THE DUST!!! by Montana Grant\nFWP News: Youth pheasant, waterfowl weekend begins Saturday\nRiley's Meats - Butte Wild Game Processing",
