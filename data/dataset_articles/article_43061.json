  "text": "For young people growing up in Athens, the University of Georgia provides greenspace to play, spots for annual field trips, and opportunities for internships, among other activities. But, for a group of Clarke County School District alumni, the University of Georgia also has become a launching pad to new discoveries, global travel and meaningful relationships. Through UGA’s Foundation Fellowship, five CCSD graduates are currently attending the university on a full academic scholarship as well as funding for travel-study, research and conferences. The fellowship is the university’s most prestigious academic program and creates a community for top scholars at UGA. “I owe so much of the joy and success of the college experience to the Foundation Fellowship,” said Dani Garcia-Pozo, a fourth-year student who graduated from Clarke Central High School. “It has introduced me to a community of fantastic, deeply kind people who really want to see you succeed. I’ve met one of my best friends through the program who encouraged me to travel abroad.” The fellowship supported Garcia-Pozo’s travel abroad to places like the United Kingdom, Ecuador, Spain and Cuba. His travels helped him become fluent in Spanish. These Clarke County graduates have found a strong sense of community and support through the Foundation Fellowship. “I always thought I wanted to get out of Athens, but after interning with the Young Dawgs program, I realized UGA was perfect for me,” said Patrick Allen, a first-year student who graduated from Clarke Central High School. “Young Dawgs showed me great professors and a depth of resources, and then the Foundation Fellowship was almost like a family.” The Clarke County graduates have remained connected to their hometown, volunteering at nonprofits and showcasing local restaurants and businesses to fellow UGA students. “Coming from Athens I’m more aware of the challenges facing Clarke County, and I’m always looking for more opportunities to serve,” said Ella Johnson, a second-year student who graduated from Cedar Shoals High School. “I joined First-Year Forum my freshman year and worked with Campus Kitchen for a year. This year, I’m focusing on literacy, which was an issue I saw in my [K-12] schools.” This year, Johnson will participate in the Books for Keeps Storytellers Literacy Mentor Program. As a volunteer, Johnson will meet with two students at Fowler Drive Elementary School once a week to help with their literacy and early reading skills. “I’ve also tried to get my friends to get out in Athens-Clarke County to volunteer, because many students don’t realize the need that exists,” Johnson said. In addition to her community service as a UGA AmeriCorps Community Food Fellow, third-year student and Cedar Shoals High School graduate Hadiza Sarr began a project to help connect UGA students to local businesses. “As an Athens native, I’m always being asked for recommendations of where to eat or shop,” she said. “I thought I’d centralize the information and help nascent businesses get discovered by UGA students.” In addition to the Foundation Fellows, students from across Athens have found a home at UGA. Currently, more than 120 students who graduated from CCSD high schools attend the University of Georgia. “UGA Admissions works hard and has had tremendous success in keeping our wonderful Athens-Clarke County students at UGA for their college years, as we have seen them go on to do great things both at Georgia and in their post graduate experiences,” said David Graves, UGA’s director of admissions. Many of these students — and their peers from other communities — remain in Athens, starting businesses, raising families and contributing to the community. Nearly 31,000 Athens residents are UGA alumni.",
