  "text": "By Devon Forward ,\n4 hours ago\nDylan Dreyer brought a little of the fun from Today home with her, dancing with her three little boys to Neon Trees before the band's appearance on the show.\nFans couldn't get enough of the giddy moment between the mother and her kids, with many praising her for her energetic parenting.\nIn the clip, Dreyer wore a cute yellow shirt and jeans while dancing in the middle of her living room, while her three sons, Calvin , Oliver and Rusty , busted a move while running and jumping around her.\n\"A little @official_neontrees dance party in honor of them joining the 3rd Hour @todayshow tomorrow!!! So excited for their new album!! #animal,\" she wrote in the caption.\nThe band saw the clip and replied to Dreyer's sweet family moment, saying, \"WE LOVE THIS! So excited! See you tomorrow! 💋💋💋.\"\n\"Love you being you,\" complimented a fan, while more wrote, \"Good way to burn energy !! So cute,\" and \"LOVE THIS!!! @dylandreyernbc you’re an awesome mama!!!😍😍😍.\"\n\"These boys will remember this forever. 🙌,\" declared another who believed the moment would become a special memory for her kids.\nMany more praised the Today anchor, with quite a few also noting how great Dreyer looked, such as a fan who said, \"Dylan is so cool. And easy on the eyes.\"\n\"Love this. How do you stay in such good shape after 3 babies? Looking great! What fun,\" wrote a different fan.\nSomeone else spotlighted the boys' dancing skills, writing, \"Your boys already have better dance moves than all the men I know. Cal will you be my plus one at the next wedding?\"\nWhile it's clear that Dreyer and her boys have some stellar talent for dancing, her husband Brian Fichera 's talents might lie elsewhere, with the 37-year-old showing off his art skills in a recent update that had Dreyer (and fans) laughing.\nNext: Dylan Dreyer Puts \"Beautiful Parenting Style\" on Display in Home Video With Son Cal\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
