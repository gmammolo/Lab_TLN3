  "text": "Jennifer Lee , the co-director of the original “Frozen,” has stepped down as Disney Animation’s chief creative officer after six years and will exclusively return to filmmaking to direct the next two “Frozen” sequels. Lee will be succeeded in the role by filmmaker Jared Bush, co-writer and co-director of the Oscar-winning “Encanto” and “Zootopia,” and co-writer of “Moana,” Disney announced on Thursday.\nLee is currently writing and directing “Frozen 3,” which is set for release on November 24, 2027, and is also co-writing “Frozen 4” (with Marc Smith) while serving as executive producer. Bush currently serves as co-writer and executive producer of “Moana 2” (November 27) and writer and director of “Zootopia 2” (November 26, 2025). He’s also writing the live-action “Moana” movie (July 10, 2026).\nBush will report to Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman, while Oscar-winning producer Clark Spencer (“Encanto,” “Zootopia”) continues as president, Walt Disney Animation Studios.\n“Jared Bush is an incredible filmmaker and a talented executive who’s been a prominent creative force at Disney Animation for the past decade, and I am thrilled that he’ll be taking the reins of this storied studio,” Bergman said. “I also want to thank Jennifer Lee for her passionate leadership of the studio over the past several years — she’s made an indelible mark on both Disney Animation and the industry. I know she has so many more stories to tell, and there is truly no one better suited to oversee the continuation of the beloved story of ‘Frozen.’”\n“I am so deeply grateful to Bob Iger and Alan Bergman for their faith in me, and thankful to Jennifer for her leadership and for her generous support as she embarks on the next chapters of ‘Frozen,’” said Bush. “Disney Animation is home to some of the greatest stories and characters of the past century, and I’m so excited to work with all of our filmmakers, artists, and Disney Animation team members as we shape the future of this legendary studio together.”\nAdded Lee: “I am so grateful to Bob and Alan for supporting my decision to return to filmmaking full time. Every day working with them is a master class in creativity, business, community, and integrity. I’ve always believed in Jared’s incredible talent and can’t wait to see, with his passion and dedication to animation, what he brings to the CCO role. For me, getting to collaborate with this studio of artists, animators, and storytellers is such a privilege, and I look forward to all we will create together.”\nAs CCO, Bush will oversee the creative output of the prestigious animation studio, including its films, series, and associated projects. Bush has been with the studio for more than a decade. He also served as executive producer for the Oscar-nominated “Raya and the Last Dragon,” and received an Emmy Award for “Zootopia+.” He additionally worked on “Frozen 2,” the Oscar winning “Big Hero 6,” and “Ralph Breaks the Internet.”\nLee is the Oscar-winning screenwriter and director behind “Frozen” and “Frozen 2,” two of the biggest animated hits of all time. Lee joined Disney in 2011 as co-writer of the Oscar-nominated “Wreck-It Ralph.” She was also an integral part of building the story for “Zootopia” and served as executive producer on “Encanto,” “Wish,” and “Raya and the Last Dragon,” as well as on the upcoming “Moana 2.”\nLee also oversaw Disney Animation’s first foray into animated series, including “Baymax,” the first-of-its-kind series “Iwájú,” and “Zootopia+,” for which she received an Emmy Award, and she is the Tony nominated writer of the book for the Broadway musical “Frozen.”\nLee, who succeeded the controversial John Lasseter as COO of Disney Animation , has been a funny, sharp-eyed, and compassionate writer and director. She expanded the Story Trust to include more writers and made sure that storyboarding occurred earlier in the process. Yet Lee was dogged by the box office failures of both the sci-adventure, “Strange World” (2022), and “Wish” (2023), the musical fantasy tribute to Disney’s 100th anniversary, with the performance of the latter film ($254 million worldwide) putting her on the hot seat.\nTo her credit, Lee also brought more women and cultural diversity into Disney’s animation ranks, which creatively drove the storytelling on “Raya and the Last Dragon,” “Encanto, and “Wish.” All three films contained modern, inclusive sensibilities for their female-driven stories, building on what Lee achieved with the ground-breaking “Frozen.”\nFor his part, Bush has proven to be a talented writer and director, evidenced by “Zootopia,” “Moana,” and “Encanto.” His animation background will be a major asset in his new role as COO, and he’s well liked among his colleagues. This should be a morale booster moving forward with his vision for continuing the Disney legacy with its own modern spin.",
