  "text": "Kano State Governor, Abba Kabir Yusuf, on Thursday, reopened the Informatics Institute in Kura Local Government Area, 12 years after it was first shut down by the former Ganduje administration.\nThe governor also distributed admission letters to 250 beneficiaries who will now begin studies at the institution, which is under the Aliko Dangote University of Science and Technology, Wudil.\nDAILY POST reports that the institution was first commissioned in 2012 by former Governor Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso to train youth in information technology, support, and give them opportunities to cope with and rise to the challenges of modern communication technologies.\nSpeaking during the official reopening, the governor said, “This moment is significant because we are concerned with the issue of education and information technology in Kano State. Let me also inform you that many graduates of the institute have made significant strides in their careers and are employed in various parastatals, companies, and ministries, not only in Kano but across the globe. The institute is designed to meet the requirements and enhance the digital economy.\n“In the previous enemy administration to our youth, this institute was left abandoned, and as a result, the state lost the opportunity to empower youth with skills, which are the bedrock of the economy, as many of our youth were left behind, lacking critical skills to be independent.\n“I am happy to say that today marks the beginning of a new era in the history of this institute for our youth and the future of Kano State. Let me assure the students that this institute will become a centre of excellence, empowering youth to become leaders in the information and digital economy by providing high-quality education to pursue careers in technology and innovation that will benefit not just Kano State but Nigeria as a whole.\n“The revival of this institute aligns with our broader vision for the digital economy in Kano State.”\nHe charged the beneficiaries to study hard and make maximum use of the opportunity to excel and contribute to the development of the state and the country at large.\nEarlier, the Director of the Institute, Mutassim Uba Adamu, said that while the institute had suffered years of neglect, the academic environment is now repositioned to align with the ever-evolving digital world with cutting-edge programmes that will put the state on the global digital map.\nHe explained that the programmes to be offered at the institution are highly skilled, demanding, employable, and globally competitive, including Information and Communication Technology, machine learning, robotics, intercom installations, security door installation, fire alarm installations, CCTV and VSat installations, wire and wireless installations, among others.",
