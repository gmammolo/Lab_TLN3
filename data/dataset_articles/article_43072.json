  "text": "By Elisabeth Edwards ,\n3 hours ago\nActor James Earl Jones is renowned for his iconic voice in Hollywood, from the menacing Darth Vader in Star Wars to the noble Mufasa in The Lion King . His career extended beyond film, as he also served as an officer in the US Army, earning recognition as a distinguished soldier both on-screen and off.\nJames Earl Jones' early life Robert Earl Jones as he appeared in a stage play + James Earl Jones at the 2015 American Theatre Wing Gala.

Walter McBride / WireImage / Getty Images) James Earl Jones was born on January 17, 1931, in Mississippi, but was raised by his grandparents in Michigan after his father, who also an actor, left the family. The trauma of losing his loved one as a child led to a severe stutter, causing him to speak very rarely. It wasn't until his high school English teacher, Donald Crouch, encouraged him to share his poetry in class that he began overcoming his speech impediment.\nAfter high school, Jones attended the University of Michigan, where he initially majored in pre-medical studies. He also joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), excelling and thriving in the structured environment and camaraderie alongside fellow cadets.\n\"My only semblance of a social life came in the fraternity of my fellow ROTC cadets in Pershing Rifles and Scabbard and Blade,\" Jones once remarked on his early experience in the US military.\nService with the US Army The Hunt For Red October , 1990.

At the time, the Korean War was raging and Jones thought he should be in a program he enjoyed before, he assumed, he was called up to fight in the conflict.\nWhile awaiting his orders, Jones worked as a part-time stagehand at a local theater. He was commissioned in mid-1953, shortly after the end of the war, and reported to Fort Benning , Georgia, where he attended the Infantry Officers Basic Course and US Army Ranger School. Jones was assigned to Headquarter and Headquarters Company, 38th Regiment Combat Team. He was a leader in his battalion, which became a training unit based in the cold and rugged Rocky Mountains of Colorado.\nThe actor shared his thoughts on the experience in an interview, saying, \"I took to the physical challenge, so much so that I wanted to stay there, testing myself in that awesome environment, mastering the skills of survival. I loved the austere beauty of the mountains and the exhilaration of the weather and the altitude. I didn't mind the rigors of the work or the pioneer-like existence. I thought it was a good life.\"\nJones was promoted to first lieutenant, but when deciding whether to fully commit to the military he knew he was destined for another path. He realized he wanted to follow in the footsteps of his father, Robert Earl Jones, and pursue acting. His commanding officer told Jones to follow his dream and reminded him that he could always return to the Army if things didn't work out.\nJames Earl Jones' successful acting career The Great White Hope , 1970.

He'd previously starred in several shows back home, including the role of Othello in the Shakespearean play of the same name. While in New York, he continued to take on leading roles in such productions, eventually becoming one of the most famous Shakespearean actors of the time.\nBy 1957, Jones had scored his first role on Broadway and, in 1964, made his first on-film appearance in Stanley Kubrick 's Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. He later appeared alongside the brightest stars of the 1960s, including Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor .\nIn 1970, Jones' leading role in The Great White Hope scored him a historic Academy Award nomination, making him the second Black man in history to be nominated in the category.\nStar Wars Star Wars: A New Hope , 1977.

He played the voice of Darth Vader in George Lucas ' Star Wars: A New Hope . Vader's character was physically played by David Prowse, with Jones' voice dubbed over. He reprised the role in the other two films within the trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983).\nHis iconic voice also appeared in animated classics like The Simpsons (1989-present) and The Lion King (1994), as well as full-fledged roles in films like The Hunt For Red October (1990) and Conan the Barbarian (1982).\nAwards and accolades James Earl Jones takes his Opening Night curtain call for the Broadway show, You Can't Take It With You , 2014.

Bush also awarded him the Kennedy Center Honors and the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award. Jones also achieved the prestigious \"EGOT\" title, meaning he received all four major Hollywood awards: an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award - although his Oscar was honorarily awarded.\nMore from us: Henry Fonda Served In the US Navy During WWII - He Didn't Want a 'Be a Fake In a War Studio'\nWant War History Online 's content sent directly to your inbox?
