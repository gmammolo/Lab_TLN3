  "text": "His Majesty King Charles III visited the UK Submarine Service at HM Naval Base Clyde on Thursday, meeting with Royal Navy submariners and their families to personally thank them for their service. According to the announcement, this visit marks His Majesty’s first to the base as Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces, although he had previously visited the site in 2011 and 2013 as The Prince of Wales.\nDuring the visit, The King toured one of the Vanguard-class submarines, which are central to the UK’s Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD) programme, a mission that has been in operation for over 55 years. He was welcomed by First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Ben Key KCB CBE, and received the Royal Salute before being briefed on the submarine’s operations.\nCommodore Paul Dunn OBE, Commodore of the Submarine Service, said, “His Majesty’s visit, his first here as Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces, acknowledges the valuable service of our submariners. The Royal Navy’s unbroken 55-year record of Continuous At Sea Deterrence is a tremendous source of pride, showcasing the skill, professionalism, and dedication of our defence enterprise.”\nThe King took time to meet with submariners and their families, acknowledging the sacrifices they make in service to the country. Chief Petty Officer (CPO) Longhurst, a submariner for 23 years, remarked on the significance of the event: “Meeting The King with my wife and shipmates today was a truly special moment, marking the culmination of my service as a Royal Navy submariner. His Majesty’s visit today not only highlights the importance of the job we do in keeping the nation safe, but it also emphasises the invaluable support of our loved ones.”\nAs part of the visit, His Majesty also met Gold Deterrent Pin holders, submariners recognised for their exceptional service time spent at sea as part of the CASD. The King concluded his visit by signing the visitors’ book in the Senior Rates’ Mess before departing.\nThe base is also preparing for the next generation of deterrent submarines, the Dreadnought-class, which will enter service in the early 2030s. Millions of pounds are being invested into HMNB Clyde to support their arrival, ensuring that the UK’s nuclear deterrence remains effective for decades to come.\nCommodore Sharon Malkin ADC, Naval Base Commander Clyde, said, “His Majesty’s visit to the Clyde today is a tremendous honour for all of us involved. This base has supported the UK’s Deterrent submarines since 1968, and today’s visit highlights the ongoing commitment of our submariners, civilian workers, and industry partners.”",
