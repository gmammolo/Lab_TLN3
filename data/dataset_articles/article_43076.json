  "text": "By Nathan Hutsenpiller ,\n2 hours ago\nPizza will always be one of those foods that brings with it a ton of loaded opinions. It’s fairly easy to make, can be reimagined into dozens of different styles and has a cult following that will rival even the largest of fanbases. It’s not a bad thing that pizza is so popular; in fact, we prefer it to be that way. There are hundreds of pizza joints to choose from across the continental United States and we get the pleasure of trying them all anytime we are someplace new.\nWhile taking a road trip across America to sample countless slices of pizza sounds like a childhood dream come true, it's not necessarily in the cards for most of us. Thankfully, the professional pizza rankers at 50 Top Pizza have done the dirty work for us, narrowing down the top performing pizzerias around the world. And surprise, surprise, NYC holds court in the number one position above the rest.\nRelated: Yelp Just Ranked the 100 Best Pizza Spots in the Midwest, and the Winner Might Surprise You\nIt takes a lot of hard work and dedication to be recognized as having the best slice in the world, and Anthony Mangieri’s Una Pizza Napoletana definitely deserves its flowers. Located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Mangieri’s shop sees itself finally landing in the top spot after spending 2023 and 2022 in second place.\nUna Pizza Napoletana is the sixth iteration of Mangieri’s pizzeria, placing focus on creating the perfect pizza by starting with a naturally-leavened crust. The pizzeria employs an “ever-changing mix of Italian flours, unrefined Sicilian sea salt and NYC water,” to create the crust of the pie before tossing it into a wood-fired oven to gain its perfect level of crispness.\nView the original article to see embedded media.\n\"In a country always accustomed to putting everything on pizza, Anthony proposes only the purest tradition in toppings, with extraordinary quality ingredients. Marinara, Margherita, Cosacca, and a pizza that changes every day, based on market ingredients,” noted the awards website , “The dough nods to the contemporary, but is so personal that it probably cannot be classified, good, tasty, true, it has the aroma and flavor of pizza.\"\nAside from their win as the top pizza shop worldwide (with Italy and Japan taking up the other places in the top five), Una Pizza Napoletana also took home the top spot in the ranking for the best pizzerias in the United States —a position they've held for the past three years.\nThis may not come as much of a surprise, but New York also found itself taking up two positions in the top five and seven positions in the top 20. Ribalta , located in the heart of Manhattan's Union Square neighborhood, came in fourth place, while Don Antonio and Song’ E Napule found themselves in seventh and twentieth positions, respectively.\nSan Francisco’s noteworthy second place position was taken up by Tony’s Pizza Napoletana , which divides its pizza menu up by style. The popular San Fran pizza joint offers Neapolitan pizza, New York-style, Detroit-style, Sicilian or really any other style of pizza you are craving.\nRelated: The Viral Recipe That Has Us Rushing to the Store to Buy Pizza Dough\nView the original article to see embedded media.\nPerhaps one of the most noteworthy finishes, however, comes from Philadelphia, in which Pizzeria Beddia snagged the third place position with no other sign of a Philly pizzeria showing up anywhere else on the list. Known to be the largest pizza spot in Pennsylvania, the Fishtown-born establishment boasts an indoor and outdoor dining situation and considers itself to be at the “top of the pizza quality movement” in the United States.\nIf your mouth is watering now just as much as ours is, you’ll want to take a gander at the full list here and start planning out your weekend immediately. Just be sure to save room for dessert though, because you know these pizza spots are going to have a tasty cannoli just waiting for your approval.\nUp Next:\nRelated: Sam's Club Is Selling a Super-Handy Slow Cooker Trio for $40, and Shoppers Say It's 'Perfect for the Holidays'\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
