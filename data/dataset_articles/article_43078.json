  "text": "By Yasmine Coleman ,\n2 hours ago\nDomino's is continuing its foray into offering foods other than pizza, and its new menu item already has fans drooling.\nOn Wednesday, Sept. 18, food blogger Markie Devo took to Instagram to share news of the chain's latest addition: Mac & Cheese.\nThere are said to be two different flavors of the creamy dish, which the foodie described in the post's caption. \"5-Cheese Mac & Cheese features penne pasta combined with a blend of cheddar, American, Parmesan-Asiago, mozzarella blend, and Alfredo sauce – all oven-baked to creamy, bubbly perfection,\" he explained, while \"Spicy Buffalo 5-Cheese Mac & Cheese adds a flavorful twist to the classic dish, as it is drizzled with hot buffalo sauce.\"\nThe big move makes sense for the brand, given that the eatery already offers a variety of oven-baked pastas prepared using the same type of noodles, including Chicken Alfredo, Italian Sausage Marinara, Chicken Carbonara, Pasta Primavera, as well as a Build Your Own option.\nThe foodie insider further shared that curious tastebuds eager to try out the new menu items can do so once they are made available at Domino’s locations nationwide starting on Sept. 23, 2024.\nIn the comment section of the upload, fans expressed excitement for Domino's twist on the cult classic meal.\n\"Definitely YAYYY. I just had a pasta bowl from them earlier 😂,\" one expressed, while another simply said \"They sound good.\"\n\"If only these had chicken in them 🤤🤤,\" a third wished, as another follower recalled, \"they used to have mac n cheese like 10 years ago! it was really good.\"\nMeanwhile, someone else suggested a minor tweak when ordering: \"I know certain locations still do it on request but this in a bread bowl would hit so differently 🤤.\"\nNext: Fans Say Taylor Swift Is ‘So Real’ for Having Domino's Pizza Delivered at Eras Tour Show\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
