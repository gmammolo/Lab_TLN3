  "text": "By Carly Silva ,\n3 hours ago\nLeave it to Ginger Zee to get in touch with nature for her wardrobe choices.\nThe chief meteorologist at Good Morning America left viewers in awe of her stylish outfit during the Thursday, Sept. 19 broadcast, where she was seen sporting a stunning bird-inspired ensemble.\nZee, 43, shared photos of the look to Instagram after the show, giving her followers a glimpse at the dark teal dress that was stamped with a colorful bird pattern.\nAs seen in the social media pics—as well as footage of Zee in action while giving the day's weather report—fans got a close-up look at the long-sleeved garment, which featured depictions of vibrantly colored cardinals, hummingbirds, ducks and more recognizable birds.\nThe dress, made in a button-down style, was tied at the waist with a colorful peach, black and baby blue belt which Zee complimented with a pair of classic pink heels.\n\"I love wearing these bird dresses to hear @maxgolembo do all the bird calls. 😂,\" she wrote in her caption, while mentioning fellow meteorologist at GMA , Max Golembo .\nFans on social media absolutely adored Zee's avian style for the day, including one user who wrote in the comments, \"I just saw your dress on TV and GASPED because it’s s perfect!! 😍\"\n\"I love the way you wear it 😍,\" someone else gushed.\nAnother fan was ready to purchase their own dress just like it, telling Zee, \"Love it. I will google bird dresses.\"\nIn her Instagram post, Zee credited her dress as being from the clothing brand Lesley Evers —and it's not the first time Zee has rocked one of the unique bird styles.\nBack in August 2023 , Zee was spotted in another dress covered in birds during a Good Morning America episode. The white short-sleeved dress, also from Lesley Evers, featured a very similar design, except for the white base fabric that made the birds pop even more.\n\"🔥Only Ginger Zee could rock that dress on national TV!\" one fan wrote under Zee's Instagram post on Thursday.\n\"That dress is for the birds 😍🔥,\" someone else applauded.\nNext: Fans Can't Get Enough of Ginger Zee's 'Fabulous' and Bold New Haircut\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
