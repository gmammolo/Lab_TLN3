  "text": "Matthew Draxton will share his report on NewsChannel 21 at Five\nBEND, Ore. (KTVZ) -- The Council on Aging of Central Oregon is hosting a fundraising campaign this month to provide needed resources to seniors with pets. The \"Food Fur All\" campaign aims to assist them with their pets' veterinary needs, as well as provide monthly pet foods and supplies.\nMatthew Draxton is speaking with council Director of Communications and Programming Emma Fried-Cassorla about the Pet Pals program and how it benefits the region's seniors. He's also speaking with a volunteer who helps prepare, pack and deliver the supplies to senior about the impact and connections he's made.\nDraxton's report will be on NewsChannel 21 at Five.\nMore information, from the Council on Aging:\nFor many seniors, fur babies are like a best friend. They smile with their tails and love you just the way you are. But for some people, it’s not always easy to get to the pet store, and vet bills can add up. That’s why the Council on Aging of Central Oregon offers the Pet Pals Program . We deliver monthly pet food and supplies and assist with basic veterinary care for Meals on Wheels clients.\nWe do this to ensure that seniors like Phillip never have to choose between caring for themselves or their cherished pet.\nThis September, we’re hosting our Food Fur All fundraiser to benefit this program. Your donation will support our free clinics, in-home veterinary care, dry and wet food, as well as supplies like beds, cat litter, treats, and carriers.\nPets provide physical and mental support to seniors, especially to those who are homebound. Having a cat, dog, or even a cockatiel has been shown to significantly reduce the feelings of loneliness and social isolation, lower stress and anxiety, increase cognitive engagement, and lower blood pressure.\nWhen you support our Food Fur All campaign, your donation goes a long way. Not only are you helping to improve the well-being of Meals on Wheels clients and their pets, but you will also be matched by anonymous individual donors and Cascade Natural Gas, who is providing a grant through the Oregon Low-Income Bill Assistance program.\nHere are some ways to donate:\nDonate online and write a comment that your donation is for Pet Pals\nSend a check and note that it’s for Pet Pals to:\nCouncil on Aging\n1036 NE 5th Street\nBend, OR 97701\nCouncil on Aging tax identification number: 93-0661229\nThanks to your generous donations, we will be able to provide pet food, essential supplies, and vital veterinary care to Central Oregon’s seniors and their pets. Your kindness and generosity will make a significant impact on the well-being of our vulnerable neighbors and their animal companions.",
