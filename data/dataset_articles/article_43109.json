  "text": "One of the most diverse strikers in soccer, Trinity Rodman, continues to shine. Her purple patch continued this phase, as she made significant contributions with a goal and assists against Houston Dash in her last league game. With her skills and gaming acumen, former basketball legend Dennis Rodman’s daughter already gained significant fandom. But how was she facing the best defenders in the world? Former USNWT legend Ali Krieger reveals her battle with the Spirit ace ended, citing her stellar evolution. [Speaking on ESPN FC’s Futbol W,](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3RQrmL0nMUcpxftaeODK9u) Krieger gave her account of how Rodman was initially said, “She had pace, she was skillful, and she was talented. You could see that confidence from the beginning. You could see when wanted to get on the ball, wanted to create.” But more interestingly, when asked if Krieger was the victim of Rodman’s skills, she said,” Yes I was. I was a victim of that. Luckily, she fouled me. I tried to get in between her and the ball. It was the Orlando Pride days. She had fouled me from behind, luckily. So she didn’t get one up on me in that game,” stating that she escaped the embarrassment with a narrow margin.

However, Krieger feels that Rodman has gotten even better. “But obviously, since then I’ve seen her progress into this confident, talented, skillful leader. Honestly, she has been a leader in the attack, both the national team and at the club level,” hinting that her current state of play may give the USNWT forward a chance. Rodman didn’t take long to establish herself as a generational talent. Krieger was with the Orlando Pride when the 22-year-old joined [NWSL](https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/soccer/national-womens-soccer-league/), helping Spirit win the Championship. And, while she failed to get past the former Pride defender, the Olympic gold medalist scored a brace against Krieger’s Gotham FC in the subsequent season. Regardless, Trinity Rodman continues to her mojo, helping Spirit reach the greatest heights.

Trinity Rodman’s recent goal against the Dash was stunning, to say the least, shooting from outside the box. But it’s her consistency that propels the Washington Spirit to compete for the NWSL Shield. After arriving from the Paris Games, she netted thrice in 4 games apart from her match-winning 2 assists. Scoring regularly for the Washington Spirit, Rodman now stands as the 4th top-scorer of the season as her team is at #2 behind Orlando Pride. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Yet, the 2021 US Young POTY confessed to being a bit weary after the Olympics. Playing in a tightly packed schedule is taking a toll on USNWT players. However, Trinity is confident of finishing the year on a high. While they need to win almost every match from here, it is Rodman that the Washington team will look up to lead them into their first NWSL Shield.",
