  "text": "Dan Campbell has seemingly settled in pretty well since taking over as the coach of the Lions, but he’s been forced to relocate due to some fans who’ve been unable to respect his privacy.\nBeing a head coach in the NFL is a job that obviously comes with plenty of perks, but there are also more than a few downsides that tend to rear their ugly head when you’re in that particular line of work.\nWhile I can’t speak from personal experience, I can imagine the paycheck that accompanies that gig makes it a bit easier to tolerate the stress you have to deal with; Browns skipper Kevin Stefanski is reportedly the lowest-paid coach in the league but still makes $3.5 million a year, so it’s safe to say he and the rest of his colleagues are able to live pretty comfortably.\nThat group includes\nDan Campbell, who was making an estimated $4 million a year before he signed a contract extension with the Detroit Lions earlier this year that runs until 2027 (the team declined to release specific details concerning the financials, but you have to imagine it came with a pay bump based on the turnaround he’s staged since arriving in 2021).\nOne of the aforementioned downsides of being a high-profile sports figure is that there’s only so much you can do to protect your privacy, which is why many members of that group tend to reside in gated communities or exclusive apartment complexes; even if you try to keep the location of your home under wraps, it tends to turn into an open secret in the area.\nAccording to Crain’s Detroit, Campbell learned that lesson the hard way after purchasing a house in the Motor City suburb of Bloomfield Hills that was previously owned by longtime Red Wings center Igor Larionov, as he said he decided to put it on the market for $4.5 million thanks to a tiny group of Lions diehards who occasionally showed up to the property to voice their discontent:\n“The neighborhood, everything. There’s plenty of space, it’s on two acres, the home is beautiful. It’s just that people figured out where we lived when we lost.”\nSome people take sports way too seriously.",
