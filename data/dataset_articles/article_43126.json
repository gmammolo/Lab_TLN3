  "text": "From treating yourself to a solo dinner at a restaurant to strolling around a museum, venturing out alone can be daunting. But after three weeks in Dublin and a solo trip to Luxembourg, I’d say first-year me would be proud.\nHaving done extensive research before my arrival, I was eager to get to Dublin’s must-see spots. I was well prepared to do so alone, reflecting on all of the experiences I missed out on during my first semester at college because I didn’t know anyone and was scared to go by myself.\nMore than anything, I appreciate the flexibility and freedom of navigating Dublin on my own.\nOne of my first stops was the National Gallery of Ireland, which I’ve been to twice now. It was nice to explore at my own pace with the audio tour, pausing at each work of art without feeling rushed.\nI’ve also been to the National Museum of Ireland - Archaeology and the National Museum of Ireland - Decorative Arts and History, where I’ve learned more about Irish history and its culture.\nTaking advantage of the last few days of warm weather, I’ve also spent a lot of time in parks, like Phoenix Park, Merrion Square Park and St. Stephen’s Green — my personal favorite. I’ve learned the most about daily life through these green spaces, people-watching as I go for long strolls.\nAimlessly wandering around Dublin also led me to hidden gems, like Marsh’s Library and a beautiful flower shop called Howbert & Mays. I may have missed these spots had I been walking and talking with others or glued to a fixed plan.\nMy biggest solo adventure by far was a 24-hour trip to Luxembourg. This small country nestled between Belgium, France and Germany boasts a rich history and stunning architecture.\nThough I never imagined myself visiting, I was quickly convinced by a 35 euro round-trip ticket for a flight just a few days away.\nWhat initially seemed scary and impulsive — navigating a country where I didn’t speak the language and staying in a hostel for the first time — quickly became one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.\nAfter checking into my hostel, I walked to what many call “the most beautiful balcony in Europe.” The view of a neighborhood called the Grund from the Chemin de la Corniche was one of the most breathtaking views I've ever seen.\nI then spent some time learning about the country’s culture and history in the National Art and History Museum, before spending hours exploring the city where I came across many beautiful buildings, monuments and charming shops before dinner\nThe next morning, I enjoyed a blueberry cinnamon bun and a unique, beetroot flavored cinnamon latte at Cinnamood before heading back to Dublin that afternoon.\nOn the way back to Dublin, I felt so much gratitude as I reflected on all I discovered about these new places and myself in just three weeks. Though not without its challenges, solitude is important and insightful.\nEmbrace it.\nMORE COLUMNS\nEditor’s note: The opinions expressed in this column are the columnist’s own. They are not r…",
