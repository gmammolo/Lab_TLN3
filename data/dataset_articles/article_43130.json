  "text": "The Arkema Première Ligue championship will return this weekend. On its first day, ASSE will travel to [Reims](/tag/Reims) like last year. In an interview for Le Progrès, Sarah Cambot talks about her arrival in Forez. Sarah Cambot, an important recruit for ASSE On June 21, 31-year-old midfielder Sarah Cambot became the fourth signing of the Saint-Etienne transfer window. She arrived from another first division club, Guingamp. Moreover, when she arrived in Forez, she was pleasantly surprised. “I was received by the coach, the president, there was the communications department. We also had a medical examination. This may seem logical for boys, but it is not necessarily so in women’s football. Straight away, I entered into something very professional and that is what I came here for.” For decades, ASSE has been one of the most popular clubs in [France](/tag/France). Since she was little, Sarah Cambot has been used to hearing about this legendary club. “It’s a legendary club that makes you want to discover it: the infrastructure, the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium… Since I’ve been here, I’ve been almost a child. There are things that I look at with big eyes.” A goal-scoring midfielder? One of Sarah’s strengths is her consistency. For several seasons, the ASSE player has been playing in one match after another and scoring goals. In fact, in 4 years she has scored a total of 21 goals - 2023/2024: 22 matches, 4 goals - 2022/2023: 22 matches, 7 goals - 2021/2022: 22 matches, 5 goals - 2020/2021: 20 matches, 5 goals Laurent Mortel has also challenged him to score six goals this year. “Six goals, I’ve already done it, so it’s achievable. Ten, never, but it can be a challenge to see if the coach is right or not. If I can do it, I won’t deprive myself of it. As I grow and change positions, if I get to five goals and as many assists, that will suit me very well too. Scoring gives me just as much pleasure as helping my teammates score.” It must be said that Sarah also has experience as a striker before being repositioned in midfield. “By changing positions, I had to find automatisms again. I had to think differently. […] “. Answer this weekend?",
