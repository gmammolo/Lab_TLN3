  "text": "The Cheryl Cates Memorial Foundation on Sept. 13 continued its mission of helping local families and children with a fundraiser at Key West Theater that raised more than $60,000. Former Key West first lady Cheryl Cates died from COVID in December 2020, as did one of her daughters, Crystal Cates. In the wake of her loss, the family created the Cheryl Cates Memorial Foundation to continue Cheryl’s commitment to bridging gaps in services and funding for the community’s most vulnerable residents. All the money raised at the recent event “will go straight to the Keys community, either via direct grants to struggling Keys residents or other non profits supporting struggling families,” said Cheryl Cates’s daughter Tammy Cates Berard. The Sept. 13 event also celebrated Cates’ love of local music by featuring live performances, including by Howard LIvingston, one of her personal friends and favorites. In addition to music, the event included a silent auction and live auction of artwork and other Key West-centric treasures.",
