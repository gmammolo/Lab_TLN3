  "text": "After more than three decades of service, Monroe County’s longest-serving elected official, Andy Griffiths, will retire in November. To celebrate his career on the Monroe County school board, Griffiths will host “Andy’s Gone Fishing” retirement party and benefit on Saturday, Oct. 12 at the Beachside Resort in Key West. Friends, colleagues and community members are invited to enjoy an evening with laughter, music and dancing, with entertainment provided by Miami’s DJ Cardi. The deadline to purchase tickets is Oct. 4.\nThis event not only celebrates Griffiths’ 32 years on the school board, but also supports a cause close to his heart: United Way of Collier and the Keys’ (UWCK) Success by 6 program.\nSuccess by 6 provides preschool scholarships to Monroe County children whose families would otherwise struggle to afford quality child care. For the 43% of Monroe families living paycheck-to-paycheck, this program ensures their children have access to early education. Proceeds from the event will be matched 1:1 by the state Early Learning Coalition, making it possible to cover a full year of preschool for each child. UWCK aims to double the number of Keys children enrolled through this event.\n“Serving the people of Monroe County has been the honor of a lifetime, and I can’t think of a better way to celebrate than by supporting a program like Success by 6, which is making a real difference for families in our community,” Griffiths said. “Helping kids get the start they deserve is something I’ve always been passionate about, and I’m proud to be part of this effort.”\n“Andy’s commitment to our community is truly inspiring, and we are deeply grateful that he has chosen to make this event a benefit for the Success by 6 program,” said Leah Stockton, UWCK Keys Area president. “This event will have a lasting impact on the lives of so many children in Monroe County.”\nGriffiths was first elected to the school board in 1992, winning eight consecutive elections, including four unopposed. During his tenure, he championed initiatives such as increased teacher salaries through the half-mill property tax, which has been supported by voters since 2004. He has served as past president of the Florida School Boards Association and Florida United Way, and has been a member of the Rotary Club of Key West for 31 years. His extensive volunteer work with local nonprofits is a testament to his lifelong dedication to the Keys.",
