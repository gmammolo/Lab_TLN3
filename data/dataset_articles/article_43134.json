  "text": "[<< Back to All News](/news) Two Texas Non-Profits Partner for Battleship Texas Memorial Flights (Lancaster, TX – September 20, 2024) - Two esteemed Texas-based non-profit organizations, the Battleship Texas Foundation and the Commemorative Air Force (CAF), are again joining forces. On Saturday, September 28, the CAF’s C-47 Ready 4 Duty is offering rides in the historic aircraft. Battleship Texas Memorial Flights will take place at Scholes International Airport in Galveston, Texas. Earlier this year, the Battleship Texas Foundation and the Dallas/Fort Worth Wing of the CAF teamed up to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day. The original plan was to send the C-47 Ready 4 Duty across the Atlantic to Normandy. However, the aircraft could not make the journey due to maintenance issues. Now, the CAF Dallas/Fort Worth Wing and Battleship Texas Foundation are ready to commemorate that historic day with the Battleship Texas Memorial Flights. This is a rare opportunity to ride on the iconic C-47 Ready 4 Duty. Riders can soar above the Battleship Texas and the Galveston area aboard this historic World War II aircraft, offering a unique perspective of Texas from the skies. As a special gift, all passengers will receive sand from both Omaha and Utah Beaches, collected during the 80th Anniversary of D-Day, giving them a piece of history to take home. You can schedule your seat today, with three ride times available: 10:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., and Noon. As part of safety requirements, all riders must be at least 12 years old and be able to enter and exit the airplane unassisted. Want your chance to ride in history?

About the Douglas R4D *Ready 4 Duty* The Douglas R4D (Navy), C-47 Skytrain (Army), and Dakota (RAF) were developed from the civilian DC-3 airliner and were used extensively in all theaters during World War II. Ready 4 Duty is a Navy version of the aircraft. Its first assignment was to airlift wounded service members and cargo. Later, it was used to test top-secret electronic equipment. Since 1985, Ready 4 Duty has been flying with the Commemorative Air Force to Educate, Inspire, and Honor through flight and living history experiences. About the Battleship Texas Foundation The Battleship Texas was decommissioned and turned into a museum and memorial on April 21, 1948, the same day the Republic of Texas won its independence 112 years earlier. Seven decades later, Battleship Texas remains a symbol of U.S. naval power and the strength of the state for which it is named. Founded in 1998 as a 501(c)3 non-profit, the Battleship Texas Foundation exists to advocate for the Battleship Texas and develop it into a premier hands-on museum and visitor attraction. Since August 1, 2020, the Foundation has operated the ship on behalf of the State of Texas. Donations and sponsorships directly impact the success of its programs, including restoration, preservation, tours, and education.",
