  "text": "[](https://euro.dayfr.com/content/uploads/2024/09/19/67d4b2876f.jpg) Felice Mazzu’s reign at Anderlecht did not last long. But he still had time to participate in the emergence of Julien Duranville. Before Brian Riemer took over the reins of the team, until today, it was Felice Mazzu who was still at the helm at Anderlecht. Today on the bench of Sint-Truiden after a brief detour from Charleroi, he explains to VoetbalNieuws that he was particularly marked by Julien Duranville. The alien from Neerpede was only 16 when Mazzu arrived at Lotto Park. He had just received his first minutes with the senior team thanks to Vincent Kompany in the last match of the Playoffs the previous season. Under the new coach, Duranville continued to show what he was made of with the first team, until he got a taste of the European Cup. “Julien, pfff… He was exceptional. He was impressive and unstoppable. What he showed in training was incredible. Julien showed that during games too. I remember bringing him on against OHL, when we were down 1-2, and he scored a fantastic goal,” Mazzu recalls. Red Devil at 18 The Trudonnaire coach is happy to see the development of his former protégé: ‘With the Red Devils, he also showed what qualities he has. He just has to find a balance between playing simply and knowing when to dribble. But when he does it and it works… My God, what a magnificent player he is. He is lightning fast, but can, in a square metre, pull off incredible technical moves with his good little feet, like a backheel or something else. He is a brilliant footballer.’ Now in Dortmund, Julien Duranville is asserting himself as a player but also as a man: “Julien was still a shy boy at Anderlecht, someone who didn’t talk much. He was very kind and humble. A really good boy.” Felice Mazzu concludes: “If he is spared from injuries, he will become an exceptional player.",
