  "text": "Altuve thinks Astros will re-sign Bregman: 'Need to make it happen' Jose Altuve is confident the Houston Astros' front office will find a way to keep his longtime teammate Alex Bregman around. \"I don't see any chances of him leaving,\" Altuve said regarding Bregman's impending free agency, according to [The Athletic's Chandler Rome](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5778279/2024/09/19/alex-bregman-astros-homestand-contract-negotiations/?source=emp_shared_article). \"That might be just me. I really think that, at the end of the season, our front office people, GM and ownership (are) going to get a deal done for him. I don't think — I'm sure — that we are not only a better team with him, but we are a better organization with him. We really need to make it happen.\" Bregman has spent his entire nine-year career with the Astros alongside Altuve. The pair has won the World Series twice together. The 30-year-old third baseman is expected to command a lucrative deal in free agency this winter, likely to exceed the six-year, $151-million extension the San Francisco Giants recently gave Matt Chapman. Houston has paid Altuve several times throughout his Astros tenure but has shown a tendency to let its other star players - such as George Springer and Carlos Correa - walk in free agency as they age. \"I don't have control, but if I could, I would just pay Breggy whatever he wants,\" Altuve added. \"His professionalism, his desire to win and his desire to get better at the stage he is - he’s a superstar - that’s really hard to find. You don’t find a lot of guys trying to get better like he does every single year, every single day. We really need to reward guys like him.\" Bregman has overcome a dreadfully slow start to the season to hit .254/.312/.437 with 23 home runs and 67 RBIs. He's accrued a whopping 39.2 fWAR through nine campaigns.",
