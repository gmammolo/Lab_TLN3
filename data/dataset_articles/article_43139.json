  "text": "Following a major win at the [Tamworth Quality Business Awards](https://www.northerndailyleader.com.au/story/8755438/tamworth-quality-business-awards-lia-mahony-honoured/), Camp Grounds' head camper Matthew Bettwesworth says the sky's the limit for one of the city's favourite cafes. \"I felt really stoked, to win Excellence in Small Business for the second time in a row, it feels like the work we've done together during the move to the CBD's main street has really paid off and I'm so proud of our team,\" Mr Bettesworth said. Looking ahead, the small business owner has big plans for the future. First and foremost, he wants to use Camp Grounds' success to build up Tamworth's night life. \"Our biggest focus at the moment is extending our hours. We've been putting it off for a bit to see what we can do, but what we want is to host events and training in the evenings,\" Mr Bettesworth said. These events will include art nights, music nights, book launches, coffee training sessions, and more. \"Also we'll apply for a liquor license. That won't be the backbone of what we do, but that'll be something that supports our events,\" Mr Bettesworth said. \"Part of my background is in viticulture and wine-making, so I'd like to showcase progressive, new-world Australian wines, like modern lo-fi [few to no additives] and different stuff you don't often get to see out this way.\" But the counterculture cafe isn't moving away from its core ethos of \"coffee + smiles\", meaning no extra food options outside the occasional nibbles and finger foods. \"Food has never been a focus for us. There's a lot of great food places here in town that do what they do really well. Our focus has always been coffee,\" Mr Bettesworth says. Tamworth's coffee connoisseurs will be holding their breath for the extended hours. There's no official start date since Camp Grounds' plans are still in the early stages and will need approval from Tamworth council. Mr Bettesworth says ideally he'd like to tick all his boxes by next year's country music festival, but much like a fine wine he says these things can't be rushed. The popular cafe [announced plans to move from Dowe Street in May last year](https://www.northerndailyleader.com.au/story/8198122/happy-campers-popular-local-cafes-compass-points-to-peel-street/) and opened its new location at 322 Peel Street the following November. \"One of the biggest fears we had with the larger venue was there's more dine-ins, so how were we going to get around that grab-and-go culture we created in our first four years?\" Mr Bettesworth said. The answer, he says, hinged on updating the cafe's vibe from a '60s industrial aesthetic to more of a '90s \"Australiana regional-style camping\" culture. Another challenge was fitting out the new space, which Mr Bettesworth says was done by the sweat of his own brow, completing \"about 80 per cent\" of the renovation himself. The response from customers has been positive, and the cafe is hardly ever empty.",
