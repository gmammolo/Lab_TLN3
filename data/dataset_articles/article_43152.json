  "text": "From Philly and the Pa. suburbs to South Jersey and Delaware, what would you like WHYY News to cover? Let us know!\nA homecoming show Friday for Philadelphia-based indie rockers Mt. Joy will also serve as a food drive benefiting local families.\nThe band’s appearance at The Mann Center is in support of their latest live album, “ Live at the Salt Shed ,” released in June, and on the heels of performances to packed houses across the country .\n“We have a lot of people that are now coming to these shows,” said singer and guitarist Matt Quinn. “Let’s just make our shows as fun as possible, and make sure these people are seeing one of the best bands out. [We want] to make sure they’re leaving and feeling like that was one of the best shows they saw all year.” WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor Mt. Joy will be performing at the TD Pavilion at The Mann Center on Friday. In 2023, the band played two nights at the Skyline Stage, which doubled as a food drive for Sharing Excess which led to fans donating 3,000 pounds of non-perishable items. (Photo by Alana Swaringen)\nFriday’s show will also be a homecoming for lead guitarist Sam Cooper who, along with Quinn, grew up going to shows at the Mann.\n“For us to be able to play that stage, it is literally like a sixth, seventh grade dream come true,” Cooper said. “We play enough shows that they all do kind of blend together, but there are moments — like I’m sure on Friday — I’ll be on stage and say, ‘Whoa, this is different. This is amazing.’”\nThe food drive will be in partnership with Sharing Excess , a nonprofit that launched on Drexel University’s campus in 2018 to combat food insecurity. During Mt. Joy’s two-night run at The Mann Center last year , fans donated roughly 3,000 pounds of food to Sharing Excess , creating 2,500 meals to combat food insecurity in Philadelphia. Sharing Excess accepted food donations outside of The Mann Center on Aug. 12 and 13 ahead of Mt. Joy’s two-night stint at the venue.

Everybody who brings a donation will be entered in to win a chance to watch the show side stage, which is a really awesome incentive for folks.” Related Content Community Mt. Joy’s concerts at The Mann doubled as a food drive. Fans donated roughly 3,000 pounds of food “Music speaks to the soul and so does food,” said Sharing Excess Director Evan Ehlers.",
