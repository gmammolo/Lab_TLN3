  "text": "Coldplay have announced several huge stadium shows for 2025 as part of their seemingly never-ending Music of the Spheres World Tour.\nThe Glastonbury headliners will be heading up north once again to play two huge outdoor summer shows next year.\nIf you weren’t able to snatch a golden ticket to the iconic festival this year and instead watched the British band from the sofa seething with jealousy, then have we got some news for you.\nFollowing the success of this year’s European leg of Coldplay’s record-breaking Music Of The Spheres World Tour, the band have just announced eight new shows for 2025, The Hoot Leeds reports .\nColdplay are skipping the Etihad Stadium this time (it’s busy working on that big extension ) but will still be venturing up north. You’ll just have to make your way over to Hull for this one.\nTheir tour dates include two dates at Hull’s Craven Park Stadium followed by six dates at London’s Wembley Stadium.\nIt’s the first time that Coldplay have performed in Yorkshire since 2008 when they took to the stage at Sheffield Arena, so you know we’re in for a fantastic show complete with all the multicoloured bracelets you could possibly imagine.\nColdplay announce huge new UK stadium shows for 2025. Credit: Stevie Rae Gibbs Coldplay will be performing in Yorkshire at Craven Park on Monday 18 and Tuesday 19 August 2025.\nColdplay have revealed that 50% of the tickets for the Hull shows – the band’s first ever concerts in the city – will go to local fans with HU, YO, DN or LN postcodes on Thursday September 26 at 6pm.\nOn Sunday evening, the band placed a poster in the window of the Dublin Castle in Camden, London revealing that 10 per cent of the band’s proceeds from the Wembley and Hull shows will be donated to Music Venue Trust.\nMark Davyd, CEO Music Venue Trust said: “Coldplay are the perfect example of a UK band who came through the grassroots circuit on their way to worldwide stadium-filling success.\n“It’s fantastic to see them celebrating their own pathway to Wembley by giving back to the grassroots music venues that supported them and recognising the artists and promoters that are struggling more than ever to build their own careers.”\nIn a world first, the band have pledged to power the Wembley concerts’ production with 100 per cent solar, wind and kinetic energy, collected at the venue and elsewhere in the UK, and delivered by a specially-designed electric battery system.\nIn addition, one of the satellite stages at each show will be powered by energy generated by the audience via kinetic flooring and power bikes.\nTickets go on sale next Friday 29 September from 9am, and you’ll be able to get yours through See Tickets here .\nRead more Kylie Minogue announces huge Manchester show at the AO Arena Annie Mac is hosting a club night in Manchester for people who want to go bed early Blossoms announce massive Manchester residency with five shows at five different venues Featured image: x",
