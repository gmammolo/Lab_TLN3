  "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — A 30-acre Knox County park that offers families and teams a chance to play on several baseball and softball fields will soon be renovated after a $140,000 donation. The Morgan Wallen Foundation said Thursday it would make the donation ahead of the country music singer's performance from inside Neyland Stadium. A release said the money would be given to the Gibbs Youth Sports program to renovate Gibbs Ruritan Park . The renovations will include overhauling the fields, re-designing the field house, installing indoor batting cages, redesigning the pitching lanes and improving the fielding area. A release also said the money would be used to fix the park's scoreboard, dugouts, seating and more. The park is located at 7827 Tazewell Pike and also offers a playground, a picnic area and bathrooms. A release from the foundation also said it made high schools to the Powell High School Band, teh Gibbs High School Choral Program, Emerald Youth's Elston Turner Cam and more. It also said the foundation works to give children more access to sports and music, supporting programs in both areas.
