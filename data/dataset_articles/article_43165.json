  "text": "(UPI) The National Toy Hall of Fame in Rochester, N.Y., announced this year's finalists for induction, including balloons, Pokemon cards and Transformers.\nThe Strong National Museum of Play said the 12 finalists for induction into its National Toy Hall of Fame this year include Choose Your Own Adventure books, Hess Toy Trucks, My Little Pony, remote-controlled vehicles, stick horses, trampolines and Transformers.\nAlso in the running are the games Apples to Apples, Phase 10, Sequence and the Pokemon Trading Card Game.\n\"It's great to see some returning contenders such as My Little Pony and Transformers among this year's class of 12 finalists, but they're up against some worthy first-time finalists, including party game Apples to Apples, the trampoline, and balloons,\" Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a news release.\n\"These 12 toys represent the wide range of play -- from strategic to whimsical to physical -- and present many playful match-ups. The selection judges and public will have some tough decisions this year,\" he said.\n Members of the public can vote for their favorites in the Player's Choice ballot online through Sept. 25.\nThe final inductees will be chosen by a combination of the Player's Choice ballots and the top picks of the National Selection Advisory Committee.\nThe inductees will be announced in November.\nCopyright 2024 by United Press International\nShare",
