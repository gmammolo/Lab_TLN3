A second way of device blasts killed 25 people and injured 608 others on Wednesday.\nWHO official Ryan said Lebanon has a medical system that is \"under huge strain, and the fact that they could stand up to this massive event is a testament to the resilience of health workers and the health system in Lebanon.\"\nDr. Abdinasir Abubakar, the WHO Representative in Lebanon, said the country's minister of health reported the death of a medical doctor in the two days waves of communication device explosions.\nHe said work needs to be done to see how the blast \"affected the people that have already been wounded, which is over 3,000 people, and also 37 people have died so far.\"\nWHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, \"These events have severely disrupted Lebanon's already fragile health system.\"\nFor months, the WHO and its partners have been unwavering in their support for Lebanon, assisting the country in preparing for and responding to mass casualty incidents.\n\"We have trained over 5,000 health workers to respond to events like this, covering more than two-thirds of the country's hospitals, and we supported the government in establishing a health emergency operation center, which is proving vital in coordinating the response,\" he said.\nGhebreyesus said the WHO distributed trauma and emergency surgery supplies as supplements in 23 hospitals.\nAnadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.
