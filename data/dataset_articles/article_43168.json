  "text": "Road 2 Recovery Foundation Opens Donation Support Page for Adler Caudle\n[Press Release](/author/press-release)\nThe following press release is from Road 2 Recovery:\nRoad 2 Recovery Foundation Opens Donation Support Page for Adler Caudle\nPOWAY, Calif. - On September 14, 2024, number 559 AMA Pro Motocross racer, 18 year old Adler Caudle was involved in a serious accident at Jeeps Motorcycle Club. During a practice session, Adler, over jumped a triple into a rhythm section causing him to not get enough lift off of the next jump. He was then sent into the face of the following jump and in an attempt to save himself, went over the next two jumps with his feet off of the pegs which sent him over the bars causing him to land on his head at the face of the last jump. As a result of his crash, Adler sustained a T-5 burst fracture with a T-5 spinal cord transection, resulting in a severe spinal cord injury.\nAdler is currently located at Saint Francis Regional Medical, in Wichita, Kansas where he has already undergone one surgery in an attempt to stabilize his spine. A spinal fusion from T-3 to T-7 with instrumentation added to the spinal column for support. Adler is currently in the surgical ICU unit being observed. Adler is now paralyzed from the waist down and it is unlikely Adler will ever be able to walk again. Despite this, he’s staying incredibly positive and hopeful, saying, “I am currently paralyzed from the belly button down and will be 'forever.' I will make a miracle happen.”\nHere are a few photos our own Mitch Kendra took of Caudle at the MX Sports Pro Racing Scouting Moto Combine events earlier this summer.\nAdler’s passion for motocross has always been inspiring, he has spent 15 years dedicated to working towards his goal of racing professional motocross and supercross. Although he won’t be racing at the national level as he’d hoped, his love for the sport remains strong. We know Adler’s positive spirit and the support from friends, family, and the rest of the motocross community will help him through this.\nFor those of you who would like to generously show your support and get updates on Adler’s recovery, please visit Adler Caudle’s Road 2 Recovery Cause Page. Additionally, we appreciate any messages and words of encouragement to lift Adler’s spirits as he and his family navigate this extremely difficult time.\nFor more information on how to support Adler Caudle, please visit his page below:",
