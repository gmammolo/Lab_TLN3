  "text": "By News Staff ,\n8 hours ago More than 20 kittens currently available – Woods Humane Society will hold a two-day adoption promotion to help kittens find homes on Sept. 21 and 22 at both of its locations. The “Doublemint Kitten Combo” event allows adopters to take home two kittens for the price of one. The standard kitten adoption fee of $150 will cover the adoption of two kittens under five months old, if adopted as a pair.\nWoods Humane Society, which has experienced a “third wave” of kitten season on the Central Coast, hopes the event will help increase awareness about the number of kittens in need of homes. According to Emily L’Heureux, Woods’ CEO, since May, the shelter has facilitated 262 kitten adoptions and has more than 20 kittens currently available. An additional 71 kittens are in foster care and waiting to be placed for adoption.\n“We hope this weekend’s event helps increase awareness about kittens in need of homes, reduce barriers to adoption, and encourage locals to consider adopting kittens in pairs,” L’Heureux said. She added that kittens adopted as pairs benefit from companionship, socialization, and transitioning into new environments, which is also a win for adopters, as it brings “double the love, affection, and joy into their homes.”\nAll kittens available for adoption at Woods Humane Society have been spayed or neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, licensed, and treated for parasites. Adoptions also come with 30 days of voluntary pet insurance and a free wellness exam at a local veterinary clinic.\nWoods Humane Society has two locations: 875 Oklahoma Ave. in San Luis Obispo and 2300 Ramona Rd. in Atascadero. Both locations are open to the public daily from 12-5 p.m., with adoption hours from 12-4 p.m. More information is available at WoodsHumane.org or by calling (805) 543-9316.\nAbout Woods Humane Society\nFounded in 1955, Woods Humane Society is a non-profit animal shelter and welfare organization that annually places up to 3,000 dogs and cats into homes. All animals are spayed or neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped prior to adoption. Visit woodshumane.org for more information.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
