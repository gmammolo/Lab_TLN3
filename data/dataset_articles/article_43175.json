  "text": "Local View: Documentary film shines light on ‘moral injuries’ suffered by veterans\nFree screenings, with discussions, scheduled in Duluth Sept. 25-26\nI served in the U.S. Army as a scout sniper during a combat tour in Baqubah, Iraq, in 2004. Before that I was deployed to Kosovo on a nine-month peacekeeping mission. My father is a Vietnam War veteran, and my two grandfathers fought in World War II.\nI want you to know about moral injury. It’s a profound psychological and emotional wound that many veterans carry from their wartime experiences. Unlike post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, which often is characterized by anxiety and hyper-vigilance, moral injury stems from deep-seated conflict between one's actions and one's personal moral beliefs.\nI appear in the recently released documentary film, \"What I Want You to Know,\" which was produced by combat veterans Tommy Furlong and Travis Weiner and directed by Catie Foertsch. This powerful film features the personal narratives of soldiers and Marines who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan where they faced moral dilemmas and ethical conflicts.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBut the film does more than recount individual wartime experiences. It provides an unfiltered look at how veterans wrestle with the guilt, shame, and self-reproach that are symptoms of moral injury. It also explores how our nation's justification for its wars can be just as damaging to the mental health of members of the Armed Forces as the terrible events that happen during war and as their own conduct in war.\nViewing the film can be both cathartic and validating for veterans grappling with moral injury. Seeing their experiences reflected in the stories of others can diminish feelings of isolation and self-blame, because the film fosters an understanding that they are not alone in their struggles. This shared connection can be a crucial first step toward healing, empowering veterans to seek appropriate help and to confront their own moral wounds within a supportive framework.\nThose who haven’t served in war may not fully grasp the toll of veteran moral injury. \"What I Want You to Know\" lays bare the full extent of what war does to those who do the actual fighting. This can increase awareness and understanding of the complexities of war experiences and encourage empathy and support for veterans.\nIt’s a fact that whenever a nation goes to war, the fighters on the ground are going to be profoundly affected, not just by physical injuries and PTSD but also by moral injury. Our nation must ask itself if this price is worth paying before we send our young men and women to fight another unnecessary war, as in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nMy hope is that public screenings and discussions of \"What I Want You to Know,\" particularly those that include veterans, will stimulate meaningful conversations about these issues and about the need for tailored support systems for our veterans.\nThe film will be shown in Solon Campus Center 120 at the University of Minnesota Duluth on Wednesday, Sept. 25 at 6:30 p.m. and in the Mitchell Auditorium at the College of St. Scholastica on Thursday, Sept. 26 at 7 p.m. Both screenings are free and open to the public.\nI will be present at both screenings to discuss the film and answer audience questions. Please join me at one of these screenings so we may explore these important issues together.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArmy veteran Garett Reppenhagen operates an ice cream shop with his wife Therese in Rockport, Maine.
