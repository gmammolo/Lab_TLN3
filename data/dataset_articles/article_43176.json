  "text": "The [Cubs](https://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/) opened their penultimate homestand on Monday night against the Athletics with a bang. They won nine to two, with 18 hits and staff ace Shota Imanaga struck out a career high 11 batters en route to his 14th win of a stellar rookie campaign. All of that was lovely, enjoyable and worth cheering at Wrigley Field on Monday night, but I would have been at the ballpark anyway. You see, Monday night was also Hispanic Heritage night at Wrigley Field and having been at a couple of these in the past I wouldn’t miss it. It is the best thing this side of seeing the Latinos duke it out in [the Miami wheel of the World Baseball Classic](https://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2023/3/12/23636259/venezuela-beats-dominican-republic-first-time-ever-world-baseball-classic). (To be clear, if that isn’t already on your bucket list, it should be). The crowd was ready to dance and cheer. There were flags in the stands. Flags in the Cubs hats that were given away before the game. Flags on the socks and the backs of fans. It was exuberant. It was moving. It was joy. So it was fitting that the first runs batted in of the night belonged to Isaac Paredes and Miguel Amaya. Paredes was literally wrapped in the Mexican flag in his image on the left field video board, Amaya held the Panamanian flag behind him with pride. The two Cubs with Hispanic Heritage both had quite the night at Wrigley Field as the team celebrated Latino culture and it was glorious. Paredes and Amaya both went 3-for-4 on the night with two RBI. You can see [Amaya’s first RBI single below [VIDEO]](https://mlb-cuts-diamond.mlb.com/FORGE/2024/2024-09/16/cc1b4935-e064e7f2-af0ae766-csvm-diamondgcp-asset-4000K.mp4). But they really just began the hit parade. Almost every Cub in the lineup got in on the action. Miguelito even hit a triple off the center field wall which had me screaming in my seat. Paredes talked about what that meant to him with Marquee Sports Network’s Taylor McGregor after the game: “Seeing all the flags around there … it feels really great to see there’s a lot of compatriots out there.”— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) Isaac Paredes on the representation at Wrigley Field at the Hispanic and Latino Heritage Celebration. [pic.twitter.com/eTVG19OJQe] [September 17, 2024] The song of the game was [Selena’s Como La Flor](https://youtu.be/FwZTgDjRLM0?si=Sr5RDUdGoO9s0RmR). The music between innings was a vibe. The organist remixed Despacito. The only thing missing was Javier Assad on the mound because that is a dude who deserves to shove on Hispanic Heritage night. Perhaps he’ll get his shot next year.",
