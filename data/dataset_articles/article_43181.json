  "text": "WESTBROOK, Maine — The family that owns Smiling Hill Farm is doing its best to protect a bee colony that has occupied a farmhouse for decades.\nThe Knight family said a hive with more than 40,000 bees grew within the walls of a home on their property.\nAdvertisement The farmhouse is in need of renovation but instead of killing the bees, the Knight family wanted to save the colony.\n\"For sixty-plus years, there's been bees in this house and it might be longer than that. It might be seventy or eighty,\" said Michael Knight.\nOn Thursday, Andrew MacDonald of Bee Huggah came to Smiling Hill Farm to safely relocate the bees from the farmhouse.\n\"I believe that these bees are worth saving for a number of different reasons,\" MacDonald said. \"They have medicinal value and they pollinate our crops.\"\nMacDonald moved the bees to a hive outside of the farmhouse.\nKnight said Smiling Hill Farm will maintain the outdoor hive. He hopes the bee colony will survive the winter so that it can be relocated somewhere else on the farm.\nTop Picks Rossen roundup: Top consumer stories from the past week New documentary chronicles the history of lowrider car culture Rossen Reports: Protect yourself after Change Healthcare data breach How to find early Amazon Prime Big Deal Days deals from small businesses",
