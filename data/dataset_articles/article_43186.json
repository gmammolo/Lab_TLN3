  "text": "[SaskTel](https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/2024/09/18/sasktel-takes-crtc-court-fibre/) has recently extended its [5G network](https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/2024/02/15/sasktel-5g-prince-albert/) to additional locations, including North Grove – Buffalo Pound, La Ronge, Red Earth Cree Nation, and 50 other sites, improving connectivity for rural and Indigenous communities, as well as main highways. “The expansion of SaskTel’s 5G network is paving the way for further growth in Saskatchewan, allowing families, businesses and communities to connect faster and more reliably than ever before,” said Dustin Duncan, Minister Responsible for SaskTel, in a statement to iPhone in Canada. “The speed and power of SaskTel’s 5G network will create additional opportunities in sectors like healthcare, education and agriculture, keeping Saskatchewan communities strong and vibrant.” SaskTel’s 5G network currently delivers speeds up to 1.2 Gbps, and future improvements are expected to bring even faster speeds and greater capacity. These upgrades are part of SaskTel’s investment of $440 million for the 2024/25 fiscal year, with over $2 billion to be invested over the next five years to ensure Saskatchewan remains digitally competitive.",
