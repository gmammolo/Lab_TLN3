  "text": "The Indianapolis Department of Metropolitan Development recently announced the opening of two applications for $11 million in grant funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. DMD will administer the funds from four HUD federal grant programs to local organizations focused on housing and community development. Two of those programs, the Community Development Block Grant and the Home Investment partnerships program, seek to provide communities with safe, affordable housing. The CDBG can also be used for homeowner-occupied repair, public facility construction, and summer youth programs. “The CDBG loan saved me a lot of money and turmoil, it was able to help me complete repairs to my home without breaking the bank,” Abner Hutchidon, a resident of Marian-Cold Spring, said in a statement. “It’s a good option to have when you’re in dire need of having something fixed or replaced around the home.” Local nonprofit and for-profit organizations as well as real estate developers are encouraged to apply. DMD also announced that to facilitate the creation of affordable housing with these funds, it will allow applicants to purchase certain city-owned properties. Organizations can also apply for grants from two other federal programs. One of those programs, the Emergency Solution Grant, is given out to groups providing emergency shelter, rapid re-housing, street outreach, and homelessness prevention services in Indianapolis. “ESG has been a vital resource for supporting veterans who may not qualify for other federal resources, for dedicated street outreach teams who play a critical role in connecting those living unsheltered to resources and housing, and for improving our data quality and compliance,” said CHIP Executive Director Chelsea Haring-Cozz. The other program is the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS program, or HOPWA, which seeks to provide housing for low-income people living with HIV/AIDS. “HOPWA is a critical resource to help prevent and end homelessness among people living with HIV/AIDS,” said Alan Witchey, CEO and President of the Damien Center. “The HOPWA funds will prevent or end homelessness for hundreds of people living with HIV this year.” Applications are due October 7th.
