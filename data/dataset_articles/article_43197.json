  "text": "On this day in 2015, Japan pulled off one of the most unforgettable upsets in Rugby World Cup history, defeating South Africa 34-32 at the Amex Stadium in Brighton. The victory, sealed by a last-minute try, is regarded as one of the sport’s greatest moments.\nJoin the RUCK’s WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\nLast-Minute Heroics With the clock ticking down, Japan’s Karne Hesketh crossed the line in the dying seconds to secure the historic win. Under the leadership of coach Eddie Jones, Japan ended a 24-year wait for a World Cup victory in spectacular style. Their only previous World Cup win had come in 1991, and their 18-game winless streak was finally broken on the south coast of England.\nJapan’s World Cup Breakthrough Before the remarkable 2015 triumph, Japan had struggled in World Cup competitions. Their drought, stretching over two decades, made the victory all the more surprising. The result sent shockwaves through the rugby world, as South Africa, two-time World Cup champions, were one of the tournament favourites.\nHugh Laurie’s Tribute The historic moment wasn’t just celebrated by rugby fans; legendary actor Hugh Laurie also paid tribute to Japan’s courage and daring. Sharing his thoughts on X (formerly Twitter), Laurie expressed his admiration, writing:\n“If you don’t speak Rugby, this will be baffling. If you do, you will recognise it as one of the greatest passages of play in the history of the game. Japan, offered repeated chances to tie with South Africa, risk it all in the final minutes. WC 2015.”\nIf you don’t speak Rugby, this will be baffling. If you do, you will recognise it as one of the greatest passages of play in the history of the game. Japan, offered repeated chances to tie with South Africa, risk it all in the final minutes. WC 2015 https://t.co/73ruL3ZQRb\n— Hugh Laurie (@hughlaurie) September 18, 2024 Laurie’s words resonated with many, capturing the essence of Japan’s bold decision to chase victory rather than settle for a draw.\nA Moment That Changed Rugby Japan’s win over South Africa remains one of the most iconic moments in Rugby World Cup history, redefining what is possible for underdog teams. The victory not only inspired millions of fans but also changed the perception of Japanese rugby on the global stage.\nNIGEL OWENS DREAM XV: Fullback: Israel Folau (Australia) Owens said: “For me, it’s nip and tuck between Halfpenny and Folau, next to nothing to choose between them. Leigh is brilliant because under the high ball and with his kicking at goal under pressure. He may not always break the line when running but puts his body on the line in defence and is a top-notch match-winner.\n“But I go for Folau – only just, I should stress – because of his ability to seemingly beat his man every time he gets the ball in his hand. He’s such an exciting player and like Leigh he is one of the best under the high ball.\n“It’s a toss of a coin for me… and it’s come down in Folau’s favour.”\nWinger: Stuart Hogg (Scotland) Owens said: “How can you fail to be impressed when watching Hogg play. He’s so exciting as he burst into that line and, of course, was named Six Nations player of the tournament.\n“I know he’s a full-back for Scotland, but he is so quick and direct he could easily play on the wing. He reminds me a bit of Shane Williams with some of the things he does.\n“When you see who is on the other wing in my team, you’ll see how they would work brilliantly in tandem.”\nOutside-centre: Brian O’Driscoll (Ireland) Owens said: “Not only is he one of the greatest centres in the history of rugby union but he’s a fantastic man off the field as well. O’Driscoll has been a wonderful ambassador for the sport and a real leader. He always respected referees and set the right example for others to follow.\n“A legend of the game who conducted himself superbly, on and off the pitch.”\nInside-centre: Ma’a Nonu (New Zealand) Owens said: “He’s another brilliant player and after every game, win or lose, he would come up and give me a hug. Ma’a has always found time at after-match functions or at breakfast if we’ve been staying at the same hotel to come over and have a chat.\n“What a player, mind, too. One of the stalwarts of the New Zealand side for so many years.”\nWinger: Shane Williams (Wales) Owens said: “When people ask me who is the best player I have refereed it’s pretty much an impossible task to pick one because I’ve been lucky enough to take charge of so many greats.\n“But if I’m pushed, I would pick Shane for what he achieved after coming from football at 17 or 18 years of age.\n“He was in the mould of Gerald Davies in how he left defenders gasping for air as he beat them with those dazzling sidesteps. Nobody would fancy defending against a back three of Shane, Hogg and Folau, I can tell you that.”\nCONTINUES ON PAGE TWO",
