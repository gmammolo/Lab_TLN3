  "text": "Marnus Labuschagne's all-round effort and Travis Head's blazing 154no helped Adam Zampa celebrate his 100th with a win A freak pectoral injury to debutant Ben Dwarshuis has dampened Australia's series-opening win as Marnus Labuschagne and Travis Head led a stirring fightback to thrash England in the first ODI. Head's unbeaten 154 from 129 balls that included five sixes and 20 boundaries set a new record as the highest ODI score by an Aussie in a bilateral ODI in England. The partnership with Labuschagne helped Australia ease to their target with six overs and seven wickets to spare as the Aussies recorded their 13th consecutive win in the format – the equal second longest streak in men's 50-over internationals. England were on track for a total somewhere near 400 after opting to bat on Thursday at Trent Bridge after opener Ben Duckett (95) and first-drop Will Jacks (62) blitzed their way through the Powerplay. Labuschagne, Australia's seventh bowler used amid a worsening injury crisis, struck crucial back-to-back blows to remove Duckett and stand-in captain Harry Brook as spin put the brakes on England and had them all out for 315 in the final over. Australia's spinners sent down 30.4 overs, including the final 18 of the innings, with Mitch Marsh deploying Matt Short (10 overs), Labuschagne (6) and Travis Head (4.4) to complement 100-gamer Adam Zampa's 10, taking advantage of the dry Nottingham surface. Head's sixth ODI ton and his second 150-plus score against England continued an incredible purple patch for the South Australian as he and Labuschagne (77no off 61) revived memories of last year's World Cup final against India by icing the chase with an unbroken 148-run fourth wicket partnership. Marsh, already down on options with star quicks Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood as well as allrounder Glenn Maxwell missing through illness, was limited further when Dwarshuis was forced from the field four overs into a promising one-day international debut. The 30-year-old left-armer removed Duckett's opening partner Phil Salt for his maiden ODI wicket and had the tidy figures of 1-18 when he suffered a suspected pectoral strain after slipping and throwing off-balance from the boundary in the 19th over. Dwarshuis went for a fitness test but was unable to return, and with Sean Abbott – the visitors' only remaining fit specialist fast bowler – conceding 50 runs in his first five overs, the Aussie skipper was forced to get creative. Enter Labuschagne, who started with a juicy full toss but within 12 balls had swung the momentum of the contest. With his fourth ball he had Duckett, who had breezed to within five of a second one-day ton, prodding at a delivery that held in the surface with Labuschagne gleefully accepting the simple return catch before setting off on a celebratory run. Still, the hosts remained determined to whack Australia's energetic part-timer out of the attack with Brook unleashing two fierce sweeps to and over the fence in his next over before he too offered Labuschagne a caught-and-bowled chance. Labuschagne's effectiveness set the tone for the rest of the innings as Marsh put the seamers on ice, deploying an array of part-time spin options in Head (2-34) and Short (1-68) alongside Zampa. \"I'd love to take credit for it - no, it was a forced change,\" laughed captain Marsh about Labuschagne's introduction. \"The longer the innings went on, we thought that pace off was certainly a better option. A bit of a gut feeling. \"I thought the way we bowled, especially our part-timers, was fantastic.\" England's new-look batting line-up also went after Australia's star leg-spinner (who conceded 27 from his first three overs), but as he's so often done across his 99 previous one-day internationals, Zampa found a way to make an impact. First it was Jacks who picked out Steve Smith at cover in the first over of his second spell, before Liam Livingstone and Brydon Carse both found Cameron Green at long-on as the hosts' innings fell apart. After reaching 2-213 in the 33rd over, they lost their next eight wickets (all to spin to make it nine for the innings) for 102 runs as Head bagged consecutive wickets to dismiss England with two balls remaining. Head and Smith (32 off 28 with three sixes) found the boundary regularly during a second wicket stand of 76, as did Green for his 32 in another 73-run partnership. Their dismissals kept England interested through the middle overs, but Head (154no off 129) remained and Labuschagne completed a fine all-round performance as a supporting act. Matthew Potts helped him to his century from his 92nd ball faced with a wide full toss, celebrating with what has become his customary helmet on the handle bat raise. Head made England pay for a missed opportunity at deep point when he was on six as he and Labuschagne slammed 97 from 11 overs after he reached his ton, Australia cruising to their sixth straight ODI win over their Ashes rivals. \"I've worked extremely hard over a few years and probably play the game a little bit more relaxed now, and take it for what it is,\" smiled Head, who was dropped by Brydon Carse at deep point in the fourth over. \"I got a bit lucky, obviously. Jof (Jofra Archer) also bowled a hell of a spell at the start, but if you can get through, there's a lot of runs on offer. So nice that I could contribute.\" Australia will be buoyed by the sight of Hazlewood bowling at significant intensity pre-match, indicating he's not far away from returning as the two sides head north to Leeds for the second ODI on Saturday (beginning 8pm AEST).
