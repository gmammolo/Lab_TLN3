  "text": "Published 22 January 2026\nShare this story\nDE&S has awarded a £453.5 million contract to BAE Systems, Leonardo UK and Parker Meggitt to manufacture and deliver 40 production standard Eurofighter Common Radar System (ECRS) Mk2 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars and supporting equipment for RAF Typhoons. They are planned to start being delivered later this decade.\nDefence Secretary John Healey today visited Leonardo UK’s Edinburgh site to confirm the award. In addition to 300 skilled roles in Edinburgh, the work secures 120 jobs in Lancashire and another 100 in Luton. Together with the work required to integrate and embody the new radar onto Typhoon jets, the overall upgrade programme sustains 1,300 highly skilled UK jobs across the UK over the next decade.\nThis advanced electronic warfare capability enabled by ECRS Mk2 – which is being delivered by the DE&S Delivery Team alongside the suppliers – is integral to the evolution of Typhoon’s air combat effectiveness.\nThese radars will simultaneously detect, identify and track multiple targets in the air and on the ground and will be fitted to 40 Typhoon (Tranche 3) aircraft in-service with the RAF. The capability upgrade is vital to the defence of UK skies and will ensure the RAF maintains its operational advantage in increasingly contested environments, using high-powered jamming whilst engaging targets beyond the reach of threats.\nLyndon Hoyle, Head of Typhoon Delivery Team at DE&S said:\n“Following successful flight trials and solid progress in the ECRS Mk2 radar development programme, now is the right time to get on with manufacturing the new radars so they are ready to integrate onto the Typhoon jets at the earliest opportunity.\n“The ECRS Mk2 radar will provide our pilots with world-leading capability to keep our country safe and deter our enemies, whilst sustaining critical engineering expertise in Edinburgh, Luton and Lancashire and therefore perfect example of defence investment as an engine for growth.”\nThe contract award follows successful integration and test flights of a prototype developed through collaboration between DE&S, RAF, BAE Systems and Leonardo.\nThis investment contributes to Defence as an engine for growth and aligns with the government’s Plan for Change, supporting working people through high-value employment whilst strengthening national security.\nDefence Secretary, John Healey MP said:\n“Our Typhoon fleet is the backbone of UK and NATO air defence, operated across Europe by the Royal Air Force and our allies to protect our skies and security.\n“As the threats we face increase, and as Russian drones continue to strike Ukraine and violate NATO airspace, this cutting-edge radar capability will keep Britain secure at home and strong abroad for many years to come.\n“In Edinburgh and across the UK, we’re backing more than 20,000 skilled workers on the Typhoon programme who ensure our RAF remains ready to protect Britain. Our government has backed their high-skilled work with more than £650 million of investment this week alone, securing British jobs and making defence an engine for growth in Scotland and beyond.”\n“This massive workforce will be sustained for years following the biggest fighter jet exports deal in a generation, worth £8 billion which we secured with Türkiye in October.”\nWith the Typhoon programme delivered through a NATO agency, operated by the UK and other NATO partners and helping defend NATO airspace now and in the future, this commitment in Typhoon underlines NATO first approach set out in the Government’s Strategic Defence Review (SDR).\nThe UK’s Typhoon programme supports more than 20,000 jobs throughout the country each year, contributing £1.4 billion to the economy annually.\nAir Commodore Nick Lowe DSO, RAF Head of Capability for Combat Air said:\n“The award of this contract underpins the UK’s commitment to provide our warfighters with the very best, cutting-edge capabilities to defend our Nation’s airspace, protect our allies, and deter potential adversaries. It also reinforces the UK’s commitment to Typhoon as the backbone of Combat Air within the Royal Air Force.”\nTyphoon remains the backbone of UK combat air capability and will continue to protect our skies until at least the 2040s.\nMark Stead, Senior Vice President of Radar and Advanced Targeting, Leonardo UK said:\n“ECRS Mk2 isn’t just an exceptional radar – it’s equipped with advanced electronic surveillance and electronic attack capabilities which will make RAF’s Typhoons more potent against their adversaries, adapting to new and unpredictable threats.\n“This contract secures 300 highly skilled jobs at Leonardo’s Edinburgh site, and 100 at our Luton site. As well as supporting over 71 UK-based suppliers, we hope ECRS Mk2 will see wider adoption by other Typhoon export users given its advanced capabilities against current and future threats.”\nRichard Hamilton, BAE Systems Managing Director – Europe & International said:\n“The Typhoon programme is a fundamental pillar of the UK’s national defence and security. Operating at the heart of NATO operations, Typhoon aircraft provide air policing along Europe’s eastern flank. The continued investment in Typhoon capability is crucial and ensures we’re able to maximise the UK’s investment in the aircraft and accelerate combat air technologies critical for defence capabilities.”\nFind out more about what we do at DE&S.\nDefence Experts Delivering for the Nation\nDE&S helps our armed forces protect the nation, our territories and our allies. Few other organisations have a higher collective purpose. It’s this purpose that drives our experts to deliver every day, making sure the soldiers, sailors and aviators serving our country have what they need to succeed.\nPartnering with industry for growth\nOur commitment extends beyond delivering world-class equipment and support to the UK Armed Forces; we are dedicated to supporting UK economic growth, driving exports, championing sustainability and creating social value across our operations and the contracts we place with industry.",
