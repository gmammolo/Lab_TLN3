  "text": "Experience sailing on the Hudson River aboard a sloop-rigged Catboat as part of the Hudson River Valley Ramble at Shattemuc Yacht Club in Ossining. Scheduled departure times for the free sail trips aboard Ferry Sloops' sloop-rigged catboat, \"Whimbrel\", or on our other participating sailboats are at 10am, 11am, 12pm, 1pm, 2pm and 3pm. Each sail will be approximately 45 minutes long. The free sails are on a “first come, first served” basis. No reservations will be accepted prior to the sail day. Guests can sign up at the yellow Ferry Sloops tent beginning at 9:30am for any of the day’s scheduled sail times. The boat’s captain reserves the right to cancel any or all of the day’s sails if weather conditions make it unsafe for sailing. There is NO RAIN DATE. Passenger restrictions: Must be at least 12 years old, under 18 years old must be accompanied by parent or adult guardian (no exceptions). For safety and boating etiquette, we ask that guests aboard our boat wear boat shoes (docksiders or non-marking sandals) or light-colored soled sneakers only. Since it’s always cooler on the water, bring a light jacket or windbreaker and a hat. Also, don't forget the sunscreen. Free parking is available on the street (Westerly Road). DO NOT park in the lots for Boathouse Restaurant or Shattemuc Yacht Club.",
