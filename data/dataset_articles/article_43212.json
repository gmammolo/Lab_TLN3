  "text": "Avoca GP saves town from doctor drought amid 60 general practices closing across Australia Michael Veal never planned to be the only doctor in the regional Victorian community of Avoca. It was winter 2023, and the Ballarat and Creswick-based GP was watching his son playing at the town's football ground when there was an injury. He offered aid, and then discovered it had been more than a year since the community's GP clinic had a doctor. \"We had phone calls a year earlier when Tristar closed, from desperate people looking for medications and prescriptions and their medical records had been lost overnight,\" Dr Veal said. \"When I drove around the town and found the building, I thought it was less of an opportunity, more of a duty to do something about it. \"I grew up in country Victoria, my children are growing up in this community.\" Tristar Medical Group was one of Australia's largest medical operators before it [went into administration on May 24, 2022](/news/2022-08-09/tristar-clnics-sold-to-family-doctor/101313886). The closure affected 29 practices nationwide and, while 12 were bought, Avoca's wasn't, leaving the town without local consultations for 16 months. It's been a year since Dr Veal set up in town with a fellow doctor, who departed last December. But the relief may only be temporary for Avoca, as Dr Veal isn't planning to stay long-term. \"I've got a mob of children who are all going to get to the end of high school in four or five years, and then … I can't guarantee I'd continue to be in any one place.\" And while [this has happened to Avoca before](/news/2021-02-22/avoca-facing-another-gp-shortage-years-after-ensuring-services/13172084), the next doctor drought may be permanent. How much a local doctor means Rebecca Wardlaw was one of Dr Veal's first patients in Avoca. A local of 30 years, she has dealt with appendicitis, the removal of her gall bladder, and chronic ear infections. She said it was never harder to manage her health than when there was no local doctor. \"I was really confused and worried, it was really hard because you didn't have someone you could just talk to,\" she said. \"It's an hour's trip to Ballarat, plus the time there waiting. You need half a day to go to Ballarat doctors, which is just hard for anyone.\" The loss of Tristar led to Avoca locals trying to get into doctors in Maryborough, 20 minutes east. When that town's GPs became booked up, they went to emergency departments for their non-urgent conditions. Some Avoca residents are still seeing doctors out of town, after switching over following Tristar's departure. And Ms Wardlaw said she understood if some were reluctant to switch back to a local GP. \"We need confidence they're going to stay,\" she said. The absence of GPs from town is also still evident in Dr Veal's day-to-day work. \"Some people are starting medical care again after a hiatus of three years,\" he said. \"Because of that, I've [diagnosed] a large number of new cancers and diabetes, chronic conditions that have been out of control, severe eczema, severe hypertension. \"So there are very obvious effects when you look at the disease burden on the community.\" A profession under siege Dr Veal is practice manager, which means he is a small business owner as well as a GP, and has been hit with all the same cost increases other businesses have experienced in recent years. \"Doctors earn a good living … [but] the businesses are actually all going bankrupt,\" he said. \"You've seen that in multiple situations because the business entity only keeps a very small percentage of those doctors' fees.\" Last November the Commonwealth tripled the bulk-billing incentive for some people. This led to a 4.7 per cent increase in bulk-billing in regional Victoria, and 2.1 per cent nationwide. But Dr Veal said it had a negligible impact on his business. \"Inflation is running at six or seven per cent and Medicare was increased by three per cent this year, so even again this year it's gone backwards,\" he said. \"There have been significant pay and super increases for reception and nursing staff, but there has been no corresponding increase in the amount of Medicare funding flowing into those businesses.\" Dr Veal charges a $40 out-of-pocket fee for each appointment beyond what he receives from Medicare. Ms Wardlaw said she was happy to pay to guarantee a same-day appointment. \"A lot of the time if you ring and make an appointment elsewhere you've got to wait three weeks. How do I know I'm going to be sick in three weeks' time?\" she said. A wider problem Data from by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) suggests at least 55 practices closed nationwide in the 12 months to September 2023, a period that began after the Tristar closures. There is no national database tracking practice closures, but the college has identified at least six other practices that have closed in the past year. Financial pressures and GP vacancies have been common reasons given for these closures. At the same time, the RACGP's latest Health of the Nation report suggests 29 per cent of GPs plan to retire from practising within 5 years, up from 18 per cent in 2021. There have also been fewer trainees going into general practice in recent years. \"People have said we are approaching a cliff and that there is a crisis in general practice,\" Dr Veal said. \"My argument is we've long since driven off a cliff, and I don't think it's easily repairable.\" Green shoots Dan Halliday, president of the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine, is himself a GP. He said there was reason for optimism despite much of Dr Veal's experience being replicated nationwide. \"We are actually really encouraged to see an increasing number of rural generalists — registrars — coming through,\" he said. \"We've had an almost 43 per cent increase in our training registrar numbers in the past 12 months.\" The Victorian government is currently trialling offering [15 Single Employer Model positions](https://www.health.vic.gov.au/news/a-single-employer-model-trial-for-victoria) at health services across Gippsland, western Victoria, and the Mallee for doctors undertaking training to be employed by a single health service while undertaking their primary care placements. Dr Halliday said while this was only happening in larger regional towns, small-town leaders could try to develop [similar initiatives](/news/2024-04-11/rural-medical-schools-placements-help-address-doctor-shortage/103645590). \"The opportunity is there, but it needs to be taken advantage of,\" he said.Loading... Dr Halliday said the loss of GPs was in nobody's interests, given their critical position in the health ecosystem. \"A lot of the major hospitals providing higher levels of care are located in our major cities,\" he said. \"If there is a higher burden of disease and care required in rural communities, that has a flow-on effect, which then in turn impacts the provision of access to care [elsewhere]. \"The better the care in the bush, the better the care in our major cities.\"",
