  "text": "In just a few weeks, Matty Gregg will lace up his running shoes and embark on a run across the entire state of New Hampshire.\nThe route starts in his hometown of Nashua and winds its way up to Manchester, Concord, North Conway, and Gorham. Then, it’s on to the home stretch, passing through Colebrook and Pittsburg on the way to the Canadian border.\nThe 46-year-old seasoned runner has completed ultra-marathons, 100-mile runs, 24-hour Tough Mudders and, in 2018, even spent nine months running 5,425 miles across the country.\nHe’s also feeling confident about the New Hampshire run, estimated to be a mere 230 miles, because he’s doing it for a cause he believes in — raising awareness about hunger and raising money for the anti-hunger nonprofit New Hampshire Hunger Solutions .\nAdvertisement\nAccording to data from the nonprofit , about 45 percent of adults in the state and 46 percent of children have insufficient food, which includes those who can’t always afford to buy the kinds of food they want.\nGet N.H. Morning Report A weekday newsletter delivering the N.H. news you need to know right to your inbox. Enter Email Sign Up Gregg said more awareness is needed to bolster support for legislative efforts, after an effort to expand free and reduced-price lunch failed earlier this year .\n“With the events that we’re doing all the way from Nashua to Canada, we should be able to show and highlight how big of a problem this actually is,” he said.\nGregg said he started running as a kid when he would race his dad at the Nashua High School track. It wasn’t until 2013 that he started running major distances, and he’d use the runs to raise money for a cause.\n“I was never going to be the fastest one out there,” he said, “but I wanted to raise the most money for charity.”\nHe found the mental challenge even greater than the physical one, and said it taught him how to set tiny goals and to take the runs one step at a time.\nStarting Oct. 3, he plans to run about 30 miles per day, averaging 10- to 13-minute miles, with the goal of completing the run on Oct 10.\nGregg said his wife and daughter will be there to support him along the way, driving ahead to scout the way and providing him with snacks, water, and encouragement. They plan to drive back to Nashua each night, until they reach North Conway, when they’ll start staying at North Country hotels.\nAdvertisement",
