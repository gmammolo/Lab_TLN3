  "text": "From Wyoming to Iowa, Lexie Warejcka’s journey honors lost loved ones ACADEMY, S.D. — Lexie Warejcka, a native of Academy and Mount Vernon graduate, is taking on a new challenge this year as a first-time runner in The 437 Project. The annual event, which began its third annual event Thursday, sees a team of runners relay across South Dakota from the Wyoming border to Iowa, covering approximately 437 miles to raise funds and awareness for mental health resources and suicide awareness. Warejcka is making strides not just for herself but for countless others in rural South Dakota. Warejcka, who graduated from Dakota Wesleyan University, is passionate about representing rural South Dakota in this year's run. ADVERTISEMENT \"I'm running for rural,\" she said. \"Rural South Dakota has always been very important to me. I wanted to make it my mission to spread awareness in small communities. You know, those less than 1,500 people.\" This focus on rural communities stems from Warejcka's observation that last year's team was predominantly from Sioux Falls, with one runner from Mitchell. As the marketing director for the South Dakota Office of Economic Development, Warejcka sees this as an opportunity to bridge the gap between urban and rural mental health awareness. The number 437 in the project’s name signifies the approximate miles the runners will cover during their trek across the state. Each runner is tasked with running about 30 miles over the course of the event, which concludes on Sept. 22. The 437 Project is more than just a run for Warejcka. She's dedicating her run to two individuals who lost their battles with mental health. \"Will was my husband's cousin. I didn't know him very well, but he loved all things farming. So when I'm out running among the corn and wheat, I think about him often,\" Warecjka said. \"Each step will serve as a tribute.\" Additionally, she's honoring Terry Severson, a friend of her husband who also died by suicide. Warejcka has etched \"Will\" on one shoe and \"iam\" on the other, and \"TLS\" (Terry's initials) on her hat, serving as constant reminders of her purpose. Warejcka's journey to The 437 Project wasn't straightforward. Earlier this year, she organized a showing of the film \"My Extension\" in Platte, hoping to raise awareness about mental health. Despite her efforts — including Facebook ads and posters — only 50 people attended, leaving her disheartened. “I wanted it to be packed, like 200 people in the theater. I was just so mad,” she recalled. ADVERTISEMENT This experience, however, led to a profound realization about her own mental health journey. Warejcka reflected on a difficult period in her life when she struggled with anxiety after being sent home from work due to COVID-19 while caring for a 6-month-old. \"I was struggling really, really bad. I didn't know how bad I was struggling because you just show up. Push all your emotions down. You be strong,\" she admitted. It was her friend Emily Ringling's persistent concern that eventually led Warejcka to seek help from a therapist, a decision that she credits with bringing her out of a dark place. Now, as a mother of two, she continues to prioritize her mental health through therapy. Warejcka has not only found healing through therapy but also discovered a new passion in running. “I started running to be healthier but then it became my mental health outlet,” she explained. Since then, Warejcka has participated in various races, including 5Ks and 10Ks, and has set a goal to complete a half marathon in every state. She has completed 12 half marathons across 11 states. As for this week's run, Warejcka faces unique challenges. Her first leg begins at 1:03 am on Friday, a time she's not accustomed to being awake, let alone running. \"I haven't practiced running in the middle of the night, but I know that the individuals I'm running for will push me to get up with the buses,\" Warejcka said. ADVERTISEMENT Warejcka humbly describes herself as the \"turtle\" of the team, emphasizing that while others may be faster, her strength lies in fundraising and advocacy. \"We all have different strengths and weaknesses. I feel like my strength is definitely the fundraising and talking; the running, not so much. I'm just no speed demon compared to everybody else,\" she explained. The emotional impact of the run is not lost on Warejcka, who anticipates hearing numerous personal stories throughout the five-day journey. \"Hearing for five days straight people's stories, it's going to be very hard. And I'm a crier,\" Warejcka said. \"But at the same time, it's also going to be my why for getting out of the vehicle and running.\" As she looks forward to the journey, Warejcka is working on a tattoo sleeve featuring 22 trees — each symbolizing a life she will honor during her run. Project 437 has gained popularity over the years, and as the runners reach various cities, the community support has grown. According to Mitchell resident Lisa Larson, people come out to cheer and even donate to the cause, reinforcing the importance of mental health awareness. \"You're darn right that Project 437 is making an impact,\" said Larson, who is running in her second Project 437 event. \"Not only are we able to give the funds back to the helpline center, it is really cool how many people know what 437 is.\" ADVERTISEMENT Warejcka said the run is a heartfelt mission to create connections, inspire change, and ensure that no one struggles alone in the shadows of mental health. “Together, we can make a difference, one mile at a time.\" ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT",
