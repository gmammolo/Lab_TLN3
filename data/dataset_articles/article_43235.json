  "text": "After practicing with a thin secondary and offensive line Wednesday, the Ravens returned Thursday with almost the full active roster. The only player missing from practice, outside of those with long-term injuries, was Sala Aumavae-Laulu, a reserve offensive lineman. He missed Wednesday’s practice for personal reasons, according to the injury report. The defensive backs saw the return of Pro Bowl safety Kyle Hamilton (back), cornerback Jalyn Armour-Davis (personal) and first-round pick cornerback Nate Wiggins (neck/concussion). Hamilton and Armour-Davis played in the first two games. Hamilton was the starting safety, while Armour-Davis contributed mostly on special teams. Wiggins played in the first game, mostly on special teams, before a car accident sidelined him from practice and games for the next week. Wiggins was in a red no-contact jersey. On the offensive line, starting left tackle Ronnie Stanley (ankle) returned to practice. He played every snap of the first two games. In the Week 2 game against the Las Vegas Raiders, he grabbed his leg a few times but finished the game. Coach John Harbaugh said Wednesday that the team was working through things but Stanley would be good to go for Sunday’s game against the Dallas Cowboys. Outside linebacker Kyle Van Noy (eye/groin) fractured his orbital bone against the Kansas City Chiefs but made it back for the Raiders game. The groin injury was new to his injury report, but he returned Thursday. The Ravens have one player, cornerback Arthur Maulet, designated to return from injured reserve. Running back Keaton Mitchell is on the physically-unable-to-perform list. There are six other players on IR, but all are depth players.",
