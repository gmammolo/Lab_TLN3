The lovers have met, and the sparks of love are igniting. Asami & MacRaith are fighting their feelings for each other…they're also fighting the warrior cult they've spurned and some new hidden forest enemies. Plus, some looks backward at the choices they made in life that lead them to hell. This series is stabby, shooty, and horny, and you know you need it.\n\"Hearing that FRANK MILLER enjoyed the debut issue of FALLING IN LOVE ON THE PATH TO HELL sent me into orbit. Frank's directly responsible for my brain marinating in samurai culture, Ronin is a timeless masterpiece and his indelible overs to the American reprints of Lone Wolf and Cub were my gateway into one of the best comics ever made. It's not hyperbole to say our comic wouldn't exist without the inspiration from Frank. Our entire team is delighted and grateful that Frank is sharing his talent on a guest cover for the start of our second arc. A true dream come true.\" —GERRY DUGGAN\nRetail: $3.99 In-Store Date: 10/16/2024",
