  "text": "2-minute read New Jerseyans who use the NY Waterway ferry service between Hoboken terminal and the ferry slip by the World Trade Center in Manhattan will get a more robust schedule of ferry times to choose from under a new contract approved Thursday by the Port Authority. Under the new 15-year contract, during peak weekday periods ferry service between Hoboken terminal and the Brookfield Place ferry terminal in lower Manhattan will increase to every 10 minutes, compared to the 20-minute intervals currently, Beth Rooney, port director for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, told the board. In addition, the new contract stipulates that NY Waterway must improve customer amenities at the ferry terminals, with heated waiting rooms, vending machines and passenger displays. Story continues below photo gallery And because of complaints by residents near the ferry terminals about air and noise pollution created by the ferries, NY Waterway will start using hybrid ferries on the Hoboken-Brookfield Place route starting in 2026, with full implementation by 2029. With the old NY Waterway contract ending in October, the Port Authority put out a request for new bids and received three, with NY Waterway ranking the highest, Rooney said. Under the new agreement, NY Waterway will also take on the responsibility for $3 million in capital improvements from the Port Authority. It will also continue to cross honor PATH riders during PATH disruptions at a reduced rate. Port Authority revenue is expected to be $10.9 million over the term of the contract. In addition to operating the ferry service, NY Waterways is required to maintain the ferry facilties.",
