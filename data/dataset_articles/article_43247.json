A tale of miracles and magic that led Vasya to a journey of greed and arrogance but was it all a facade? The much-awaited Hotstar Specials’ Taaza Khabar is back with its season 2 streaming exclusively on 27th September 2024 on Disney+ Hotstar. Produced by Rohit Raj and Bhuvan Bam under the banner of BB Ki Vines Productions and Directed by Himank Gaur, the series also stars the veteran actor Jaaved Jaaferi along with Shriya Pilgaonkar, Prathamesh Parab, Deven Bhojani and Shilpa Shukla in prominent roles among others. Vasya’s destiny and his vardaan will be challenged by the powerful Yusuf Akhtar leading to risking his life yet again along with his loved ones. Will Vasya be able to fight it or will Vardaan support him this time again? While talking about his experiences and the bond created during the shoot for the latest season, Prathamesh Parab said how he found brotherhood on the sets of Taaza Khabar season 2. He received undying support and guidance throughout the season from his director Himank Gaur , and co-star Bhuvan Bam . He opened up saying “Himank Gaur is like a brother to me now. He supported and helped me a lot in Season 1 and Season 2. He guided me throughout both seasons. Without him, I don’t think this show would have turned out the way it has. The best thing about him is that he always listens to our point of view.” Talking about Bhuvan Bam, Prathmesh said “In the previous season, Peter and Vasya were good friends, but in this season, I think they share a bond that is like brothers. Bhuvan acted really well and taught me so many things on set. This also increased our bond, which you will clearly see on screen. I think not only onscreen but our offscreen bonding is also very good. We always have each other's backs. There were many difficult scenes as well that we shot together, where our whole bodies used to be covered with dust. When we were shooting in the dump yard, we used to forget our lines because of the bad smell of that yard.” Get ready to witness the ultimate quest for money and fame with a touch of comedy with Taaza Khabar Season 2 only on Disney+ Hotstar streaming from 27th September 2024",
