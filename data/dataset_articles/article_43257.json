(Image: DC) Hyderabad: Approximately 8,200 tonnes of additional garbage was collected in GHMC limits from September 7 to 19 in addition to 7,500 tonnes of municipal solid waste generated every day.\nThis additional garbage does include plaster of Paris (PoP) material. Most of the waste on the city roads comprised colour-paper sprinkled on roads as part of the Ganesh celebrations, paper plates, plastic glasses, empty water sachets and puja and decoration material. The load was transported to the Jawaharnagar dump yard.\nSweepers and sanitation workers continued their efforts on Thursday. Even tank bund was clean by 8 am though around 50 idols were immersed in the early hours.\nThe strenuous 24x7 task of cleaning, spread over the last three days, was taken up by 15,000 sanitation staff.\n“Removing the colour paper from roads was a big challenge,” said Dr. P. Bhargava Narayana, assistant medical health officer at GHMC Jubilee Hills circle.\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )",
