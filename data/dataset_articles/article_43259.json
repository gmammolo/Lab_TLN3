On September 21, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., Wildflower will welcome home buyers and their families to a fun-filled event to celebrate the launch of remarkable new homes. This range of contemporary homes to suit all lifestyles includes front-garage, single-family homes from the low $600s, spacious townhomes from the high $400s, and sleek, modern condos from the high $200s.\nWhichever type of home you choose, you’ll love the unique, curated interior design and architecture. Each home is a stunning showcase of sophistication and rustic charm. At the Wildflower Design Centre, you can choose from a range of customizable floor plans.\nNestled on the west side of Airdrie, Wildflower is a unique, previously sold-out, new community offering breathtaking views and access to exclusive homeowner amenities. The upcoming launch event lets visitors get to know Wildflower, and features activities for everyone.\nTour the three show homes, enter the raffle contest to win an e-bike, explore the newly finished playground with the kids, play pickleball or basketball, try out the bike pump track, shop the local vendor Mini Market, and enjoy delicious burgers and popsicles catered by Minto Communities.
