  "text": "Autumn is around the corner and since I’m a basic B, I love going ALL IN on all things autumn. I have a whole box of Halloween sweaters and fall outfits that I pull out on September 1st each year and a stash of pumpkin candles that are burning nonstop until Thanksgiving.\nIf you also love autumn, these are all my top fall activities to do alone, with your partner, friends or the whole family to get in the mood for autumn.\nFun Fall Activities & Bucket List Things To Do To Get In The Mood For Autumn I had to put on my Kiel James Patrick fall sweater to write this post. Sets the vibe, you know? Fall is kinda of a whole aesthetic.\n1. Apple Picking Head to an orchard and gather a bushel of fresh apples, perfect for pies and cider! Apple picking season is usually August – September, depending on your location and is one of my most favorite fun activities to go to kick off fall.\nI love to put on one of these cute apple-picking outfits and finding a local apple orchard that lets me pick apples right from the tree. If you happen to live in California, these are my favorite Apple Hill orchards to visit! Some of them also sell pies, donuts and caramel apples.\nCopy here 2. Gilmore Girls Marathon One of my favorite fall things to do is do a Gilmore Girls marathon. There’s something about the town of Stars Hollow and that theme song that makes me all giddy for apple cider and crunchy leaves.\nI love having a “wind down” show that I watch before bed and Gilmore Girls is my bedtime show for September-November usually!\nPS – we have a whole post on how to dress like the Gilmore Girls for fall if you want more inspo. 3. Sample The Starbucks Fall Menu Starbucks dropped their fall menu on August 22. This year (2024) they launched a new drink! The iced apple crisp nondairy chai plus the two drinks launched last year have returned: the iced apple crisp oat milk shaken espresso and an iced pumpkin cream chai tea latte! The apple crisp drink is so dang tasty.\nEvery August… and September… and October, I always have to march my ghost sweatered self over to Starbucks to grab a Pumpkin Spice Latte.\nI also make a PSL at home , but I can never have enough!\nAvila Valley Barn Apple Cider Float 4. Make A Fall Charcuterie Board For Wine Night Red wine pairs so well with Halloween movies and cheese boards. I love making a fall-themed charcuterie board (this one features a skeleton!) and it’s so much fun!! Such a hit with the girls, I’ll be making it again this year.\n5. Stock Up On Fall Candles Another major must fall activity is to swing by a local boutique (or shop online) for fall candles. My favorite is this October candle , but Target also has a lot of good, affordable ones!\nThis took me 30 minutes! 6. Do A Ghost Photoshoot One of the most unique things to do in fall that I love is a ghost photoshoot! This trend emerged from TikTok a few years ago and I of course had to do a photoshoot with my friends!\nGrab an old sheet, sunglasses and a camera, then head to somewhere spooky for tons of fun and memories. Use one of my Halloween caption ideas for your spooky post to Instagram.\nAnd if you’re looking for more photoshoot ideas for couples, besties and more, check out this list of ideas!\n7. Ghost Painting Challenge Speaking of TikTok, this autumn another fall fun activity emerging is finding an old painting at a thrift store and painting little ghosts in the frame.\n8. Go Leaf Peeping Take a scenic drive or hike to admire the vibrant fall foliage. It’s hands down the best outdoor activities for fall! I always plan a trip with my friends to go hunting for all foliage in California.\nSometimes I travel, too! One year, I went to find all the best Utah foliage spots and loved seeing the mountains covered in orange, yellow and red. You’ll have to check foliage reports to find when it’s peak season for your location, but it’s worth the planning!\nPS – if you’re looking for free things to do in fall, leaves are free to look at!\n9. Spend An Afternoon Pumpkin Carving Get creative with pumpkin carving to make spooky or whimsical designs. A s a kid, my favorite things to do in Fall was pick out a pumpkin and bake the seeds! Always fun fall activities for the family.\n10. Visit A Pumpkin Patch One of my favorite fall activities even now as an adult is driving down to a Half Moon Bay pumpkin patch to wander rows and rows of pumpkins to take home.\nHere in California they have green, white, pink, black and of course, orange pumpkins so it’s fun to grab a few in every color. And here are some fun pumpkin patch outfit ideas for you and the kiddos!\nFarmer John’s 11. Go On Hayrides I love to try and find a pumpkin patch that offers these!

I haven’t been yet, but it’s high on my autumn bucket list to spend a couple of weeks visiting Salem, Vermont and New Hampshire!\nIf you live on the East Coast, i’ll be easier to plan a last minute trip. Otherwise, make sure to give yourself a few months to book and plan!\n14. Do A Corn Maze Adventure Test your navigational skills in a challenging corn maze. Kids love this! My parents took me to a corn maze every October and I got really, really good at them. It’s a life long skill.\n15.

It’s located in St. Helens about 30 minutes outside of Portland .

Visit a Winery Enjoy wine tastings amid breathtaking fall vineyard views. I adore sipping on Sonoma Pinot Noir while soaking in the changing leaves with wine.
