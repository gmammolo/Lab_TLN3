  "text": "Creating Catering Camaraderie at Disney: Q&A with Nanlie Nanlie, a Catering and Events Guest Experience Manager at EPCOT, says her Disney journey can be summed up in these words: “learning something new every day.” Even after 10 years as a cast member, Nanlie still finds herself caught up in the wonder and excitement of working for The Walt Disney Company. “It is truly a beautiful thing,” Nanlie said. “See[ing]…the happiness you can bring to someone’s face in your role is truly rewarding.” Like many cast members, Nanlie’s first steps in her Disney journey began as a Disney College Program participant. After extending her program, she supported numerous front desk roles at the All Star Resort. Nanlie got the call for her next adventure to work in Food and Beverage at Disney’s Hollywood Studios, which prompted her newfound passion for what she says is, “the amazing world of Catering.” Now at EPCOT, her current role allows her to work with planning teams and cast members to ensure the visions of clients and guests come to life. She’s supported and oversaw the completion of numerous unforgettable Disney projects, such as the opening of Toy Story Land and Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge at Walt Disney World Resort. What previous experiences/training helped prepare you for your role? Every location I worked at is truly what helped and molded me to where I am today. How does your work impact and influence Disney’s success as a company? In Catering and Events, we create memories and moments that will last a lifetime. We want the family, companies and friends who visit us to come and enjoy the same experience they did the last time they visited. What inspires your work? What inspires my work is knowing that anything is possible once you put your mind to it and being open-minded to learning something new every day. What is your favorite aspect of your team environment? How even during busy times, we can all come together and deliver! What are the most challenging and most rewarding parts of your role? The challenging parts can be when things might not go as envisioned. The rewarding part is seeing the team’s hard work create something wonderful! What has surprised you the most about working at Disney? What has surprised me is although it’s a huge company, it truly is a small world. People you started your journey with come full circle at times and you cross paths again in the near future. How do you hope the diverse storytelling from our Company impacts future generations? By showing our future generations the endless opportunities they have waiting for them. What would you say to someone considering working for Disney? Do you have any advice for them? My advice to them will be to follow your heart. Anything in life won’t be easy, but it is the difficult roads that lead us to beautiful destinations. Be who you are and shine in your light! No matter the role you get, YOU ARE THE MAGIC. Ready to be a part of creating the magic behind the scenes like Nanlie?
