  "text": "Brooks & Dunn have announced their forthcoming collaboration project, Reboot II. Due out on November 15 via Sony Music Nashville, the album is available to pre-order now. Reboot II is a sequel to their acclaimed 2019 album Reboot and follows the same format; except this time, a brand new group of today's most engaging artists - from country and beyond - were given maximum creative freedom. The duo gave one simple direction: to reimagine the song to fit their own taste and style from the ground up. The 18-track album features contributions from Lainey Wilson, Morgan Wallen, Marcus King Band, Megan Moroney, Warren Zeiders, Jelly Roll, Riley Green, The Cadillac Three, HARDY and Corey Kent, among others. \"The premise of the project was 'No rules.' For this one, we purposely loosened the screws and turned 'em loose to do whatever they wanted,\" Ronnie Dunn explains. \"We actually went way off the rails, in a good way.\" \"This project is a lot more out of bounds,\" Kix Brooks adds. \"Artists were going, 'Would it be okay if we did this?' It was like 'Yeah! Let's do it.' We dealt with rock bands and blues bands and all kinds of genres, all over the place.\" Reboot II Tracklist: \"Play Something Country\" with Lainey Wilson \"Neon Moon\" with Morgan Wallen \"Rock My World (Little Country Girl)\" with Marcus King Band\"Ain't Nothing 'Bout You\" with Megan Moroney \"Brand New Man\" with Warren Zeiders \"Believe\" with Jelly Roll \"She Used to Be Mine\" with Riley Green \"She Likes to Get Out of Town\" with The Cadillac Three \"Boot Scootin' Boogie\" with Halestorm \"Ain't No Way To Go\" with Mitchell Tenpenny \"How Long Gone\" with The Earls of Leicester \"I'll Never Forgive My Heart\" with Jake Worthington \"She's Not the Cheatin' Kind\" with Hailey Whitters \"Hard Workin' Man\" with Christone \"Kingfish\" Ingram \"Hillbilly Deluxe\" with HARDY\"Indian Summer\" with ERNEST\"Drop in the Bucket\" with Thousand Horses \"Only In America\" with Corey Kent For comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com Entertainment News September 06, 2024 15:35 ET Highlights of this week included crucial data from the U.S. labor market that could steer the Fed’s policymaking going forward.
