  "text": "Governor Andy Beshear FRANKFORT, Ky. -- Gov. Andy Beshear provided an update Thursday on several projects and achievements in Kentucky.\nThe \"Team Kentucky\" update included the following:\nEconomic Development\nGov. Beshear highlighted new growth in Kentucky’s manufacturing sector.\nNiagara Bottling, a manufacturer of bottled water and soft drinks, announced plans to locate a new $129.8 million production facility in Kenton County creating 60 new full-time jobs in the area.\nMoody’s Rating Upgrade\nGov. Beshear announced that Moody’s Ratings has upgraded the commonwealth’s credit rating to Aa2 from Aa3.\nThe rating is a measure of the state’s ability to pay debts and the overall health of Kentucky’s economy.\nThe Governor says the upgrade was driven by the commonwealth’s sustained commitment to healthy reserves and structural balance, including by fully funding pensions and paying down unfunded liabilities.\n“This is the third major rating increase for Kentucky in just over a year,” said Gov. Beshear. “This is a fantastic milestone for Team Kentucky as we show everyone that our economy is booming, our pensions are strong and our fiscal house is in order due to strong management and smart choices that put our people first.”\nFlags to Half-Staff Saturday in Honor of Russell County Sheriff’s Deputy\nGov. Beshear expressed his condolences to the family and friends of Russell County Sheriff’s Deputy Joshua Phipps, who was killed in the line of duty this week.\nThe Governor ordered flags at all state buildings to be lowered to half-staff from sunrise to sunset Saturday, Sept. 21, in honor of his life and service.\nNew Madisonville Law Enforcement Training Facility\nThe Governor announced a historic expansion of law enforcement basic training in Western Kentucky.\nA new training facility will open in Madisonville in February 2024.\nPreviously, officers from every county in the commonwealth have traveled to Richmond to receive the 20 weeks of training.\nFor the first time since basic training became mandatory in 1998, the commonwealth will be able to offer training in two locations simultaneously.\nNew officers located in the western part of the state will soon be able to train closer to home.\nThe Department of Criminal Justice Training will train officers in a building provided by the Madisonville Police Department while Team Kentucky constructs a $50 million multipurpose training facility in Madisonville.\n“As a former police chief, I know how critical it is to get new officers into the academy, trained and back on the streets to keep our communities safe. Training is where safe communities start,” said Department of Criminal Justice Training Deputy Commissioner Mike Bosse. “We are so proud to have this opportunity to expand access to Kentucky’s state-of-the-art, exceptional law enforcement training.\"\nEastern Kentucky Housing Announcement\nThe Governor announced $7,750,000 to help build homes for flood survivors in Eastern Kentucky.\nThe awards come from Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery funding, administered by the Kentucky Department for Local Government.\nGov. Beshear awarded $5,000,000 to Partnership Housing, Inc. to build six duplexes in the city of Booneville, located in Owsley County, for a total of twelve housing units.\nSafe Streets and Roads For All Grants\nThe Governor announced that Team Kentucky was awarded nearly $28.5 million for seven separate grants in the newest round of funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\nThe grants will fund improvements such as revamped pedestrian crossings, constructing new sidewalks and walkways, improving roadway shoulders, constructing roundabouts to replace high crash rate intersections and other safer road solutions.\nThe funding comes from the Safe Streets and Roads for All Grant Program, which is overseen by the U.S. Department of Transportation.\nClick here for a list of those projects.\nDownload the free WSIL News and Weather apps for the latest stories and alerts sent straight to your mobile device.",
