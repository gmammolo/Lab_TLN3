(Image:DC) Hyderabad: Thousands of Muslims participated in a vibrant procession, on foot, on bikes and on vehicles, to celebrate Milad-un-Nabi, following the Zohar namaz at Macca Masjid on Thursday. Originally set for Tuesday, the event was postponed by two days due to Ganesh idol immersion and Liberation Day.\nBefore the procession commenced, religious scholars delivered speeches emphasising the Prophet’s messages of peace, harmony, and brotherhood. The Markazi Milad Juloos Committee has been organising this procession for the past two decades. Shujauddin Ifteqari, a committee member, remarked, “This event helps many young people learn about the Prophet and his timeless teachings.”\nHazrat Syed Kamil Pasha, Aashiq Khan Rasool, Syed Junaid Pasha Quadri, Dr Hafez Mohammed, Mahmood Hussain, and Syeed Quadari were among those who attended the procession.\nThe procession travelled through various locations, including Falaknuma, Volta Hotel, Yahiya Pasha Dargah, Macca Masjid, Haj House, Patherghatti, Alijah Kotla, Lal Darwaza crossroads, Charminar, Gulzar Houz, Madina, Nayapul bridge, Salar Jung Museum, Salajung Rotary, Purani Haveli, Etebar Chowk, and Bibi Bazaar.\nIn Secunderabad, mosques were beautifully illuminated for Milad-un-Nabi, and hundreds of youth participated in a procession starting from Chilkalguda crossroads, passing through Sitaphalmandi, Vidyanagar, and Amberpet. Local Milad celebration committee members warmly welcomed participants, offering fruit juice and water.\nAlso, blood donation camps, which began three days earlier in conjunction with Milad, continued on Thursday. At a drive held at Masjid Dargah Hazrath Syed Budde Shah Wali in West Marredpally, many youths came forward to donate blood. Committee members expressed gratitude for the community’s support, stating, “Saving lives is at the heart of the teachings of Prophet Muhammad.”\nA large gathering was also held at Jamia Masjid Himayat Ali Khan on the Osmania University campus, attended by numerous faithful.\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )",
