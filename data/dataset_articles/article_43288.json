This season, we'll be breaking down the league's best receivers each week, offering a detailed look at each player's impact. As we examine these wide receiver rankings, keep in mind that these early-season receiving grades are fluid and will continue to evolve over the coming weeks. Once we have larger sample sizes, the rankings will stabilize, giving a clearer picture of the top performers. 1. [Chris Godwin](https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/chris-godwin/11839), [Tampa Bay Buccaneers](https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/tampa-bay-buccaneers/30) (91.1) Godwin continued his hot start to the season, recording four catches of 15-plus yards against Detroit, including a 41-yard touchdown in the second quarter. Godwin was the only Bucs player with over 50 receiving yards on the day. Godwin has caught 15 of his 16 targets through the first two weeks of the season, gaining 12 first downs and catching two touchdowns. He is top-three among all receivers in catches, yards (200), first downs and yards per route run (3.92). Godwin has been perfect against zone coverage, catching all 10 of his targets for 152 yards. He has also been perfect in late-down situations, catching all seven of his targets for 99 yards and six first downs. Godwin has a perfect passer rating when targeted to start the season. 2. [Nico Collins](https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/nico-collins/61441), [Houston Texans](https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/houston-texans/13) (90.5) Collins had another big game Sunday night, catching eight of his 10 targets for 135 yards.

He leads San Francisco in targets (19), catches (13) and receiving yards (164) through the first two weeks of the season and is averaging 2.45 yards per route run. Almost all of his production (11 catches, 147 yards) has come against zone coverage. Samuel suffered a calf strain during the game and is expected to miss a few weeks. 4. [Rashee Rice](https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/rashee-rice/97605/draft-profile), [Kansas City Chiefs](https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/kansas-city-chiefs/16) (83.6) Rice recorded five catches for 75 yards against Cincinnati.
