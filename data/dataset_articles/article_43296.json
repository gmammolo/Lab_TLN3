  "text": "By Matt Jaworowski ,\n2 hours ago\nGRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — A deputy from Metro Detroit is being commended for climbing into a moving vehicle to help a driver dealing with a medical emergency.\nThe incident occurred last Thursday heading down Gratiot Avenue, a four-lane street in Mount Clemens. Two Macomb County Sheriff’s deputies found a driver creeping down the road at approximately 5 miles per hour.\nThe driver, identified only as a 63-year-old man, would not pull over. When the deputies pulled alongside him, they saw that he appeared to be in a daze and was not responding to their calls.\nWould-be Florida car burglar gets trapped in Corvette, video shows “Eventually, the driver of the truck rolled down his window and briefly hit the brakes. Deputy (Nicole) Miron, who had been in the passenger side of the patrol vehicle, was able to exit the window of the Sheriff’s SUV and climb into the truck while the vehicles continued traveling on Gratiot,” the Sheriff’s Office said in a social media post .\nOnce inside, Miron was able to put the truck in park and turn it off. A local fire crew arrived moments later to help treat the driver.\nMiron was able to call one of the driver’s family members to confirm the likely medical complication, although MCSO did not elaborate on the specifics.\nA snapshot of the bodycam from Macomb County Sheriff’s Deputy Nicole Miron as she jumps into a moving truck to help a driver dealing with a medical complication. (Courtesy Macomb County Sheriff’s Office) Miron told a local news affiliate that she and her partner didn’t have any other ideas.\n“Before (making the jump), I’m thinking of all the options that we have; I mean, there’s not many,” Miron told WDIV . “At that point, I let him know that I am going to go through the driver’s window, and that’s what I did. I jumped right over him.”\nMichigan teen to be included in 2025 Guinness Book of World Records Sheriff Anthony Wickersham credited Miron for putting herself in harm’s way to help a citizen in need.\n“Due to her quick thinking and selfless actions, she safely ended what could have been a tragic situation,” Wickersham said in a statement.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
