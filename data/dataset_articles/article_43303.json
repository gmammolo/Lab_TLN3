  "text": "AVOL Kentucky holds day-long ‘Dining Out For Life’ event LEXINGTON, Ky. (WKYT) - By simply going to grab a bite to eat or something to drink on Thursday, you can help support AVOL Kentucky’s mission to end HIV in the Commonwealth. AVOL is again holding its ‘Dining Out for Life’ event with more than 50 participating restaurants and businesses. “It’s Christmas to us at AVOL and we work very hard all year long to get this put together,” said Anthony Smallwood, AVOL Kentucky. AVOL Kentucky uses the day to not only raise money, but to be visible. “It’s the one day that all over Lexington, people are talking about us and what we do and who we are,” said Smallwood. AVOL representatives, like Smallwood, said there are a lot of people who are living a long time with HIV, but they still need help with things like medications, housing and care. “We started out as a group of volunteers helping people. Actually, helping people die with dignity that had AIDS when no one else was even saying the word. Now 35 years later, we are helping people not just survive but thrive.” Smallwood says because the stigma is still so strong about HIV, it’s important that their work never stops. “We appreciate our restaurant community and all of the community for coming out and supporting. Just going out to eat is the easiest way in the world to donate.” “‘Dining Out For Life’ is AVOL’s biggest fundraiser of the year. 54 businesses, including Lussi Brown Coffee Bar, will donate 25% of the day’s sales to AVOL. “Which is a big ask in the restaurant community because the profit margins in restaurants is not huge. Our restaurant partners really are bought into our mission,” said Smallwood. Smallwood says some places, like Third Street Stuff, have participated since its inception in 2009, while others are first-timers. “We’ve got Lost Palm and Granddam at the Manchester; both of them are new this year, and then Ouita Michael has always participated in some capacity. This year, she went all in, and she’s got all six of her locations.” AVOL hopes to either match or top what they raised last year, which was $120,000.
