  "text": "Oh, you thought summer was fun? Wait until fall hits in Miami. After a surprise re-opening set for this coming weekend, Club Space Miami just announced its end-of-the-year full calendar. Now, we know the Insomniac venue is known for their incredible House and Techno acts, but let’s see if they’re bringing the heat with these artists. They also announced that Space’s jointed venues The Ground and Floyd enjoyed a well-deserved facelift.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by S P A C E (@spacemiami)\nFull Calendar September will finish with a bang with acts like Peggy Gou, Green Velvet, Fisher, and Dombresky gracing the Terrace. October is filled with amazing melodic acts including Miss Monique, Bob Moses, Nora en Pure, Marsh, and Innellea. Furthermore, Club Space will once again host the official satellite afterparties for III Points Music Festival , also hosted by Insomniac . November gets a spooky start for Halloween weekend with the soundscapes of Nicole Moudaber, Paco Osuna, Seth Troxler, and an impactul b2b with Dixon and Âme. After a night with Brazilian star Vintage Culture, the Techno takes over for shows with Joseph Capriati, Carl Cox, Deborah de Luca, Camelphat, and a heavy night with Psymama Indira Paganotto and direct support from Lee Ann Roberts. Thanksgiving will be extremely groovy with Space’s signature DJ Marco Carola, before Enamour, Wax Motif, and Acraze.\nDecember will be a phenomenal end of the year, starting with 6 days of parties for Art Basel week. Exhale’s label boss lady Amelie Lens returns to the Terrace, as well as Ilario Alicante and Duke Dumont. New Years week will have you baffled with parties going from Friday the 27th to Wednesday January 1st. Space’s residents will provide heavy support to all these amazing acts.\nRefreshing The Ground and Floyd Sister venues for Club Space are locating on the bottom floor, and they will be as fun as ever. Including major redesign opportunities, there will be more space to dance at The Ground, as they took away the VIP section. Moreover, the space will continue to book live acts, but shift gears to the more niche and underground genres that deserve a space in the electronic dance scene in Miami. So if you want to break your neck at The Ground to some Dubstep, or Drum and Bass, this is your call. Floyd will now have a DJ-centered experience for more intimate shows with the audience. The expansion of both rooms was long overdue, and we can’t wait to see it. The Ground has also served as a lounge area during the iconic marathons at the Terrace.\nSo what do we think about the Space calendar? Are we getting tickets or what?!",
