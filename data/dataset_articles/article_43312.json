  "text": "Indian army officer hails Pakistan peacekeepers in Sudan\nAn Indian army officer has lauded Pakistani Blue Helmets, also called peacekeepers, professionalism in ensuring the protection of civilians, according to the military’s media wing.\nIn a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations said that the Pakistani contingent protected over 250,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the flood affected areas of South Sudan.\n“The professionalism of Pakistan peacekeeping contingent has been acknowledged by the Force Commander United Mission in South Sudan Lieutenant General S Mohan from India,” the ISPR said on Thursday.\nIn the line with mandate assigned by the United Nations Security Council, the statement added: “The Pakistani Peacekeepers are performing their duties for maintenance of peace and security in South Sudan.”\nAccording to the ISPR, the Indian general officer made the acknowledgement in the form of a letter to Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir. He commended the contingent’s “professionalism, dedication and unwavering commitment”.\nMoreover, the Indian general officer also acknowledged the role played by Brigadier Shafqat Iqbal as sector commander and Lieutenant Colonel Shahbaz Aslam as commanding officer.\n“The force commander’s recognition serves as a testament to the Pakistani Army’s reputation as a reliable and capable partner in international peacekeeping efforts,” the ISPR said.\nPakistan, it added, “remains committed to play a pivotal role as a responsible member of the international community to help realise the ideals of global peace and security through active support in UN Peacekeeping Missions.”\nFor the latest news, follow us on Twitter\n@Aaj_Urdu.\nWe are also on\nYouTube.",
