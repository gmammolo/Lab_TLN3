  "text": "KSHSAA Board of Directors approves changes to high school sports participation WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - The Kansas State High School Activities Association (KSHSAA) Board of Directors approved changes to how many games or events students can participate in. Starting in the 2025-26 season, high school basketball teams will be able to play 23 games, up from 20 games, during the regular season. The change was initiated by the Kansas Coaches Association. It does not include the postseason. The item was passed with a 36-25 vote. Other approved items include allowing tennis players to participate in one outside competition during the school season. The events must [meet certain criteria](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fkshsaa.org&c=E,1,uW_8uG5VYay4X_x6oW8d-pRYk57LX3pLvIoXTXWVCTEc6ZbIlAHAPzzYc3KcPhPpcl163tFA1iJB0Z-5UwXOvMzUIVDdEcA6fL_FjR7pKn0V&typo=1&ancr_add=1) and be approved in advance with a request to KSHSAA initiated by the member school.
