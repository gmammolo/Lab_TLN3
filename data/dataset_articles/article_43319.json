  "text": "Mateo Berry Elevates Streetwear and Skate Culture With Reserved Essentials\nThe relaunch of Reserved Essential marks a significant moment for the brand and its founder, Mateo Berry , whose journey through the fashion world has been one of innovation, creativity, and influence. As a Honduran-American fashion designer, entrepreneur, visual artist, and creative consultant, Berry has carved out a niche in the industry, blending his deep-rooted passion for streetwear culture with luxury fashion.\nRaised in Los Angeles, California, Berry's early exposure to visual arts came through his involvement in skateboarding. This subculture, known for its unique aesthetic and rebellious spirit, fueled his interest in art, fashion, and music. Berry began exploring these interests on a broader scale, eventually leading to the creation of \" The Come Up TV \" during his college years.\nThe lifestyle blog became a platform for showcasing collaborative visuals and interviews with creatives on the rise. Berry’s keen eye for talent led him to feature artists like Big Sean, Drake, Kid Cudi, Lupe Fiasco, Pusha T, and Wiz Khalifa, many of whom were in the early stages of their careers. Berry’s ability to capture the zeitgeist of the emerging streetwear scene quickly garnered attention and helped his transition into the fashion industry.\nIn 2012, Berry took on a freelance photography role with Blvck Scale, a brand synonymous with the intersection of streetwear and high fashion. His collaboration with ASAP Rocky on the Blvck ASAP capsule collection not only solidified his place in the industry but also showcased his talent for visual storytelling. Berry’s photograph of Rocky’s first solo tour poster became an iconic image, gracing magazine covers, billboards, ads, and tour merchandise.\nBerry's tenure as the general manager at Black Scale further expanded his influence, as he oversaw the brand’s LA and NY storefronts, helping to shape the direction of the label during a pivotal time. His experience with Black Scale set the stage for his next venture with Stone Island in 2016. Here, Berry played a crucial role in opening the brand’s first American flagship location and immersed himself in studying luxury sportswear design in Italy—a move that would heavily influence his future work.\nBerry would relocate to London to conceptualize and design Reserved Essential after amassing a wealth of experience, and developing a distinct vision for what the brand could become. In December 2017, Reserved Essential made its debut with a collection that was both innovative and deeply rooted in the culture that had shaped Berry’s journey. The collection was met with enthusiasm, landing placements with prominent publications, and catching the eye of celebrity stylists.\n\"Reserved Essential was born out of this idea to create a mixed media site where I could showcase everything I was doing,\" Berry explains. “It started with a blog, some merch, and photography—just a reflection of my lifestyle. People connected with it so much that they said, 'This should be your brand.' At the time, I was helping friends with their projects, but never really focusing on myself.”\n“That push is what made me turn it into something bigger. They encouraged me to turn it into a full-fledged brand.\" Reserved Essentials was born, blending Berry’s artistic vision with his deep-rooted connection to the digital era, and street culture on the West Coast.\nReserved Essential quickly became a favorite among celebrities, with designs worn by people like Billie Eilish, Future, Travis Scott, Michael B. Jordan, Young Thug, and Juice WRLD. The brand's ability to resonate with such a diverse group of influencers speaks to Berry’s unique approach to design, and one that merges the raw, unfiltered energy of street culture with the sophistication of luxury fashion.\nThe upcoming relaunch of Reserved Essential is a reaffirmation of Berry’s vision and the brand’s place in the fashion landscape. The signature camouflage cargo pants in corduroy material push the boundaries of what streetwear can be when fine materials meet edgy ideas. This relaunch builds on the brand's already legacy, bringing new designs that reflect Berry’s ongoing evolution as a designer and his commitment to creating pieces that speak to the next generation of fashion enthusiasts.\nFrom his early days in Los Angeles, where skateboarding was more than just a sport to Berry, it was a gateway to art, music, and fashion. Berry’s journey has been marked by his ability to blend these elements into something truly unique.\n\"Skateboarding was my introduction to everything,\" Berry reflects. \"It wasn't just about the tricks; it was about the culture, the style, the music. It shaped who I am and how I see the world.\" This perspective is evident in his work, particularly in his latest venture, Reserved Essentials, and its offshoot brand, La Sainte-Air , which he describes as \"a brand that wasn’t supposed to be a brand.\"\n\"When I started Reserved Essentials, I wanted it to be more than just clothing,\" Berry shares. \"I wanted it to tell a story, to reflect my experiences and the culture I grew up in. That’s why I included everything from vintage photography to streetwear inspired by the places I’ve been and the people I’ve met.\"\nAs he began to dive deeper into the world of fashion, he found himself gravitating towards vintage hats . \"I started sourcing any vintage hat I could find,\" he recalls. \"But as I talked with friends and collaborators, like H. Lorenzo , I began to focus more on pop culture references - things that people from our generation could really relate to.\"\nThis focus led to the creation of La Sainte-Air, a collection within Reserved Essentials that pays homage to iconic moments in pop culture. \"I wanted everything to be a pop culture reference,\" Berry says. \"From Coca-Cola hats from the eighties to Blink-182 caps, I wanted each piece to be a little slice of history.\" The hats Berry sources are more than just accessories; they are artifacts of a bygone era, meticulously curated to evoke a sense of nostalgia and style.\n\"The sourcing process is time-consuming and tedious,\" he admits. \"But it's worth it when you find that perfect piece, like an original ESPN logo hat from the seventies or a Newport Cigarettes cap. These are not just hats; they're pieces of a cultural narrative that I'm trying to preserve.\"\nBerry’s passion for his work is palpable, especially when he talks about the challenges of maintaining the quality and authenticity of these vintage items. \"I’m very particular about the condition of the hats I source,\" he explains. \"They have to be wearable, not just collectible. I don’t want people to hesitate to wear them because they’re worried about how many heads they’ve touched.\"\n\"When we first launched, the hats sold out almost immediately,\" he says. \"People were trying to collect every color, every style.\" Berry remained grounded in his roots. \"Everything I do is still influenced by skate culture,\" he says. \"It’s the foundation of who I am. Even now, as I work on these projects, I’m always thinking about how it connects back to that community.\"\nBerry’s work with Reserved Essentials and La Sainte-Air is not just about fashion; it’s about storytelling, about preserving the cultural moments that have shaped our world. \"I want to blur the lines between different worlds,\" he concludes. \"Whether it’s a rapper, an athlete, or a chef wearing one of my hats, I want people to see the connection, to understand that culture is fluid, and that we’re all part of this ongoing narrative.\" Berry continues to promote luxury streetwear, proving that fashion is not just about what we wear, it’s about who we are and the stories we carry with us.\nCassell Ferere Following",
