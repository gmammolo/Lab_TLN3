  "text": "The Cleveland Browns bounced back in Week 2 against the Jacksonville Jaguars. The offense looked more competent this week, and the defense shut down a potent Jaguars passing attack. The Browns played well last week, and much better than in their debut. The stats are starting to reveal how good the Browns are.\nIt must be stated that there’s nothing more important in data analytics than a large sample size. Football is considered a small sample size sport due to the lack of games compared to the other major sports leagues worldwide. Most football analytic experts believe teams need to play four to six games before we can identify trends.\nFans should appreciate the outliers in the data instead of reading the tea leaves. For example, the best two defenses in expected points added have both played the Carolina Panthers, who benched former number-one pick Bryce Young earlier this week. It’s important to keep stats in perspective during the early phases of the season.\nNFL Tiers based on EPA ~~ Week 2 NFL Thread ~~\nThe Bills are good and the Panthers are not\n(asterisk for the Chargers/Saints because they played the Panthers)\nLook at Washington’s offense! pic.twitter.com/k0SjFeiAfj\n— Computer Cowboy (@benbbaldwin) September 17, 2024\nThe Browns are hiding behind the Titans and Raiders on the line separating the second and third worse tiers. Series Results How hard it is to move the ball against each defense\n(“played the Panthers” applies to Chargers/Saints here and “played the Broncos” to Seahawks/Steelers) pic.twitter.com/YjJ6gd0BPa\n— Computer Cowboy (@benbbaldwin) September 17, 2024\nThe Browns offense still failing to score points. Meanwhile, the Browns defense are one of the best at forcing teams to settle for field goals instead of touchdowns. QB Chart Quarterback grade and efficiency through Week 2\nMalik Willis!\nNot hard to guess who has been benched already pic.twitter.com/78l2OntGYX\n— Computer Cowboy (@benbbaldwin) September 17, 2024\nPro Football Focus seem to think Deshaun Watson is playing much better than what his numbers indicate. Kevin Stefanski and the Browns are throwing the ball more than ever Pass rate on early downs when the game is close\nJim Harbaugh has been as advertised. Will be interesting to see how they do when they first have to play against a real team (KC week 4) pic.twitter.com/C5a89XQwYV\n— Computer Cowboy (@benbbaldwin) September 17, 2024\nEarly Down Rushing and Passing efficiency How effective each team has been at rushing and passing on early downs\nThe elite Eagles passing offense as we've often said pic.twitter.com/LAHHEOFRXZ\n— Computer Cowboy (@benbbaldwin) September 17, 2024\nThe Cleveland Browns are still trying to figure out their run game. Browns pass protection has been dominant Pass block grade of offensive linemen in true pass sets only (excludes plays with less than 4 rushers, play action, screens, short dropbacks and time-to-throws under 2 seconds) pic.twitter.com/uPzuvzBexb\n— Computer Cowboy (@benbbaldwin) September 17, 2024\nTrench play by ESPN analytics and PFF grades All trench measures from PFF & ESPN\nAs always, lol good luck measuring run defense pic.twitter.com/4FoLyUVUTA\n— Computer Cowboy (@benbbaldwin) September 17, 2024\nGambling Market derived team tiers Week 2 Objective Power Ratings\n(grain of salt for QB injury teams GB & MIA) pic.twitter.com/rHPNYvGufZ\n— Computer Cowboy (@benbbaldwin) September 18, 2024\nDenzel Ward stands alone as the best cornerback in the NFL A very early look at CB separation prevented and grade on ball pic.twitter.com/m3JtRjhAy7\n— Jrfortgang (@throwthedamball) September 18, 2024\nWatson is one of the best at extending plays How long a QB extends the play once pressure arrives and how often they take a sack when under pressure pic.twitter.com/QagBJzEPlM\n— Jrfortgang (@throwthedamball) September 17, 2024\nDefensive coverage rates Team coverage rates through week 2 pic.twitter.com/H6C1lh1iWJ\n— Football Insights 📊 (@fball_insights) September 18, 2024\nThe Browns are running more cover four to start the season. Browns receivers are starting to separate Jameson Williams showing out with some other downfield threats. Ja’Lynn Polk/Mark Andrews are interesting.
