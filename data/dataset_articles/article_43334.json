  "text": "Bella Lin Founder of GuineaLoft $71,000 monthly revenue Published September 19, 2024 by Niall Doherty A recent video on YouTube…\nMy Amazon Side Hustle Brings In $409K A Year — At Age 17… Description 👇\nBella Lin, 17, is the founder of GuineaLoft , a company that sells products for small pets, including guinea pig cages, bedding, food feeders and water bottles. In 2024, GuineaLoft has brought in an average of $71,000 per month in revenue so far.\nShe only launched this in 2022, wasn’t happy with the products available for her pet guinea pigs and started building her own.\nGiven that it’s physical products her profit margin is probably 10-20%, but that’s still $7-14K per month only two years in 🤑\nMaybe there’s an opportunity to do something like this for other pets.\nCats and dogs would be tough, but pet birds and lizards are just as popular as guinea pigs and the market is likely much less competitive.\nFirst time seeing our Online Money Maker profiles?
