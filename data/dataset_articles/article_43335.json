Inspired by the rich heritage of Russell Square Gardens, the British Museum’s collection, and Camden’s Irish community, Echo weaves cultural narratives into its form with reclaimed materials representing the artist’s commitment to sustainability and challenging traditional sculpture norms.\nFestival Director Rosemary Richards said “It’s a great festival for bringing people and communities together. We are really proud to present the work of new theatre makers and musicians embarking on their professional careers as well as showcasing the academic and local creative talents of the people of Bloomsbury. It’s a celebration of talent with artists and musicians joining us this year from around the world. Come and join us over the 10 days of the festival!.”",
