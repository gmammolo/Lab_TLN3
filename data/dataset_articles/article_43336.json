  "text": "Your eyes will go full gape over the wonders on display in the flesh and blood silly show Babezilla Vs. The Cyber Skanks: Rise Of MechaBabezilla , written and directed by Andrew J Chambers. It picks up where the last installment of the franchise left off, with a recap of the climatic battle of Babezilla Vs. The Zombie Whorde. Babezilla (Stephanie Love), a porn star by day and reptilian barbarian queen by night, is scheduled for a big meet and greet with her eager fans. However, the evil twins of the villains in the previous movie, Dr. Cornwallis (Kevin Heesacker) and Dr. Stephenson (Erik Luna) are plotting revenge on Babezilla as she slew their brothers.\nSo right when Babezilla is about to sign a happy fan’s big dirty milkers, the event is invaded by the doctors’ cybernetic death squad, the Cyber Skanks. We have Captain Cut (Vinyl Dowling) who has circular saw blades for hands. We have Colonel Clamp (Kelsey Livengood), who has giant metal claws. Last but not least are the deadly hugs from Major Mammeries (Raven Foyt), who has chainsaw blades extending from her boobies. A mass slaughter ensues, with fans being massacred and parts of Babezilla’s bodysuit being sawed open. Babezilla drops her drawers to pull out her cooter cannon, but the Cyber Skanks bring with them MechaBabezilla (Bobbi Jo), the evil robot version of our hero. As a laser beam blasts out of Babezilla’s vagina, it is met by an even stronger laser blast from behind MechaBabezilla’s metal labia.\n“…porn star by day and reptilian barbarian queen by night…”\nLeft beaten and bloody to crawl from the wreckage, Babezilla receives a vision from Momzilla (Ginger Lynn), her dead dinosaur mother. Momzilla tells her daughter that she needs to seek out the wisdom and warm bosom of Master Beta (Jessa Flux), who can give her the training she needs to face her foes once again.\nBabezilla Vs. The Cyber Skanks: Rise Of MechaBabezilla is a perfect example of the difference between being clever and being witty. Witty this is not, as the humor is blatantly subjuvenile and corn chip. But it is literally clever as f**k, with a lot of unexpected inventiveness in its elevated treatment of graphic nudity. As the market for softcore sex and skin fell through the floor with the advent of pocket-sized hardcore for free on your phone, we are now in a post-exploitation landscape where there are no longer any commercial nudity rules like before.\nTaking full advantage of the freedom offered in these cinematic wild lands, Andrews utilizes Love’s talents of manipulating her buxom form to generate moments of surreal physical art. Love shoots lasers out of her nipples like Godzilla’s heat vision, but it is the weaponizing of her p***y as a channel of atomic fire that brings endless joy to the universe. It is a simple effect made phenomenal due to the actress’s willingness to whip around her meow-meow on camera. Love, masked as a lizard for battle action with a sword and string bikini, carries with her the power of a Frazetta painting, with full awareness of the energy of certain angles while keeping it untamed.\n“…a lot of unexpected inventiveness in its elevated treatment of graphic nudity.”\nYes, it looks cheap, but that’s part of the raw throb that it wields. It all comes from an Ed Wood Jr. style aesthetic that makes sure you can see the string holding up the pie plate UFO in the air. The worse it looks, the better it works here. That goes double for the Dr. Butcher MD -like gore sequences when the doctors cut up the women to make the cyber skanks. Andrews is serious about the film not taking itself too seriously. There is a wonderful throwaway substitute for the non-sword fight sequences where the performers do little dances in place of throwing punches. It is more tongue-in-cheek than the rimming world finals.\nOther masterful post-exploitation moves include the purposeful skipping of potential sex scenes, like the cutaway when Jo’s delightful paste-on mustache was about to get to work. This allows the nudity to remain uncaged and incorporated into the narrative in non-functional ways. Andrews also makes sure all sorts of bodies are involved of all shapes and sizes. This includes several big, beautiful women who can pop them out like the best of them. And Lynn gets to have a lot of fun as the Brando here doing Superman’s father for Love. Legends matter, and Lynn never fails to impress. Babezilla Vs. The Cyber Skanks: Rise Of MechaBabezilla is cheese, but it is one of those refined, stinky cheeses like the kind that waltz out of France—total party movie to the max.",
