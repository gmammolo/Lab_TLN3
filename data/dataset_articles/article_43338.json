  "text": "Cozy Up With Our Top Picks! Cozy season is coming! It's time to light the seasonal candles and get your sweaters out of storage. As the vibrant [fall leaves](../../../P/ultimate-guide-peak-fall-colors-united-states) begin to blanket the ground, it's also time to refresh your TV programming. Certain shows and movies just give off an autumnal vibe and must be watched during that season. Let's take a look at some of the best shows and movies to watch during this time of year. [The Vampire Diaries](https://amzn.to/3XOkHmB) The series was released in September 2009, coinciding with the back-to-school season. And, of course, vampires are spooky, and spooky = autumn. The aesthetics and moody vibe create the perfect fall atmosphere. It can sometimes be a little corny (Hey, it's a teen drama!), but that makes it fun! Katherine Pierce is also a fun villain and one of my favorite characters. I even dressed up as her for Halloween one year. [Twilight](https://amzn.to/47wIN8C) Staying on the vampiric nostalgia train, we have Twilight. I remember seeing the movie when it premiered around Thanksgiving time in 2008. It was such a craze. We just couldn't resist vampire romances during this time! Between Edward's sparkly skin and an iconic soundtrack, Twilight has it all. And who can forget the blue tint the whole movie seemed to have? Some disliked this aesthetic choice, but I'm quite a fan. Go ahead and watch the whole series if you want to dive in, but the first one is the best. Fun Fact: While the first Twilight movie premiered before The Vampire Diaries, the book series was actually published after the initial few volumes of The Vampire Diaries. [Gilmore Girls](https://amzn.to/4gsakw5) While I've never watched the show myself (please don't come for me), many people consider it a fall classic. It's a cozy show set in a small town and heavily features coffee, making it perfect for the fall season. Get comfy with this easy, light-hearted watch while sipping hot coffee with Lorelai and Rory. [Virgin River](https://www.netflix.com/title/80240027) I used to watch Virgin River with my friend, and while it's silly and soapy, it's very comforting. It has that whole small-town thing going for it that feels extra cozy for the autumn season. [Coraline](https://amzn.to/3XtG3o9) Coraline brings together cute and creepy. The Neil Gaiman movie is geared toward children (it has a PG rating), but it's a little spookier than most kid's movies. The animation style adds to the overall whimsy, and the whole ambiance feels perfect for the season. Coraline is also a great example of \"be careful what you wish for.\" [James and the Giant Peach](https://amzn.to/47FYSsP) Another scary kids' movie is James and the Giant Peach. What TF was this movie? It traumatized a generation, but it holds a space in our hearts. This truly bizarre movie is best paired with a blanket and some snuggles, whether you're cuddling with your partner, pet, or besties. [The Haunting of Hill House](https://www.netflix.com/title/80189221) The Haunting of Hill House has eerie, spooky vibes, making it one of the best watches for the season. As someone who isn't typically a fan of scary stuff (I'm a baby), I absolutely loved this series. It is a bit creepy, and there are some jump scares, but it's so beautifully done. I'd honestly say it's more sad than anything. Like, this show makes me cry. It's so emotional and perfectly crafted. The storytelling is so good, switching between the past and the present. The child actors are so cute and did a good job, and the older actors are great. Also, the ending of the episode \"The Bent-Neck Lady\" sends chills down my spine. I love everything about this show. Fun Fact: The actor who played Elliot in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is in it as the dad. [E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial](https://amzn.to/4gxWd8I) That brings us to our next recommended autumn viewing, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. This movie is an absolute classic! It's a sweet, heartwarming story with a little something creepy going on. Despite his unique appearance, E.T. is an endearing and curious alien. Although the world fears him because he's different, they end up acting like the real monsters. It's a great message not to judge people (or aliens) because they're different. [Wednesday](https://www.netflix.com/title/81231974) Wednesday is mysterious supernatural fun. It's pretty cheesy (maybe even more so than The Vampire Diaries), but that makes it easy to watch. As we enter the harsher weather, it's nice to have something easy and comforting. [American Horror Story](https://amzn.to/47A3e4T) I've seen this show's bits and pieces, and it is well-suited for the spooky season. Fans can debate which season is their favorite (it's my understanding that the newer seasons aren't as well-liked) and enjoy the super creepy aura and interesting storylines. [To All The Boys I've Loved Before](https://www.netflix.com/title/80203147) This [Netflix movie](../../../P/every-title-coming-to-and-leaving-netflix-this-month) is one of the cutest and best modern-day Romcoms/coming-of-age films. It starts off in the back-to-school season, making it a fun watch for the fall. It's highly focused on crushes, making returning to school a little more tolerable. I love this movie and the love story between Laura Jean and Peter. Although I never read the book series, the story is reminiscent of many teen romance books in general, making it a very enjoyable watch with a nostalgic feeling. I think a re-watch is in order! Football Unfortunately for me, football season has returned. I'll watch a few games at the bars as an excuse to put on a cute outfit and drink some beers, but I can tell you that I'm not particularly invested. And the games are simply way too long. With that being said, football is a quintessential fall activity, and many people look forward to it every year. Whether you're a die-hard fan or just casually watch for the social aspect, football definitely has a place on our autumn watch list (even for me). Like, I can't not recommend it, ya know? This selection of movies and shows captures the essence of the autumn season. Whether you're in the mood for heartwarming tales, spine-chilling mysteries, or supernatural adventures, there's something on this list for everyone to enjoy. So grab a warm blanket and a mug of your favorite seasonal beverage, and let these stories transport you to familiar and fantastical worlds. *This post may contain affiliate links, at no additional cost to you, and OurCommunityNow.com may earn a small commission.",
