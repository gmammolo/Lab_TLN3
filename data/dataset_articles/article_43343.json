  "text": "Agartala (Tripura) [India], September 19 (ANI): Tripura has witnessed a significant rise in tourist footfall over the past few years, Chief Minister Manik Saha said on Thursday while addressing a gathering at the inauguration of tourism facilities.\nHe also blamed the previous state governments for not working to increase tourism in the region adequately, saying that they blamed the central government and neglected Tripura.\nAlso Read |\nRG Kar Hospital Rape-Murder Case: Junior Doctors Call Off Protest Partially in Wake of Flood Situation in West Bengal.\n\"The number of tourists is on the rise, and it will continue to increase. People often visit Sikkim, Darjeeling, Meghalaya, and other parts of the Northeast, so why not Tripura? Those who were in power for many years never worked towards promoting Tripura's tourism. They simply blamed the central government and neglected Tripura. There are numerous hidden treasures in the state. Since the BJP formed the government, we have been exploring these hidden spots. We have also introduced the Tripura Tourism Policy to attract investors, and investors are indeed showing interest,\" CM Saha stated.\nWhile addressing a gathering after the inauguration of tourism facilities at the Sulma Dongur Tuisoi Waterfall, located in Sanaiya Reang Para, Dhalai district, he also highlighted that in financial year 2023-24, 4.7 lakh domestic tourists and over 75,000 international tourists visited Tripura.\nAlso Read |\nJPC Meeting on Waqf Amendment Bill 2024: Heated Debate Between Muslim Representatives and Committee Members Over Property Seizure.\nThe Sulma Dongur Tuisoi Waterfall is located at 130 km distance from Agartala.\nThe CM further highlighted that the state has benefited from former Indian Cricket Team captain, Saurav Ganguly, becoming the ambassador for Tripura tourism.\n\"After Saurav Ganguly, the former captain of the Indian cricket team, became the brand ambassador for Tripura Tourism, tourist footfall has increased,\" he added.\nStressing on the importance to use social media for promotion of tourism, he said, \"If we can effectively use social media to promote such attractions, more people will visit. Tripura has many hidden gems that people are unaware of. We are leveraging social media and brand ambassadors to promote Tripura Tourism. More efforts are needed to make Tripura better known.\"\nThe CM also highlighted initiatives like organising light and sound shows, the PRASAD scheme to renovate the Mata Tripura Sundari Temple and the Swadesh Darshan 2.0 scheme.\n\"Additionally, we have organized light and sound shows that highlight the princely regime at Ujjayanta Palace. It is essential to treat tourists from outside Tripura with politeness, ensure their safety, and make them feel welcome. Under the PRASAD scheme, we are renovating the Mata Tripura Sundari Temple, and the work is nearly complete. Once the development work is finished, even more visitors will come. Additionally, under the Swadesh Darshan 2.0 scheme, the development of tourist spots in Agartala and Unakoti has been principally agreed upon,\" he added.\nTourism Minister Sushanta Chowdhury, Dhalai Zila Parishad Sabhadhipati Sushmita Das, MLAs Manoj Kanti Deb and Swapna Das Pal, Tripura Tourism Director Prasant Badal Negi, Dhalai District Magistrate Saju Vaheed, and Dhalai SP Avinash Rai were also present during the inaugration.
