I am ecstatic and hungrier than ever before for what's to come,\" the actor said.\nThe International Emmys, to be held in New York on November 25, will be hosted by Indian comedian Vir Das, who won an award last year for his stand-up special \"Landing\".\nNominees for International Emmys come from different countries such as Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, India, Chile, Colombia, France, Japan, Germany and many others.\n\"Every year the international television community competes to be recognized on the International Emmys' much coveted global stage,” said International Academy President & CEO Bruce L.
