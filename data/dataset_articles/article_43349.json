  "text": "We know it’s tough to sort through the offerings on the 700,000 streaming services churning out content, so we’re bringing you a curated little list of what to watch. This week: Frasier! Menendez murders! “The Traitors Canada” returns!\n1. Frasier\n“Frasier” fans freaked out when they discovered beloved OG series characters like Niles and Daphne wouldn’t return for the reboot. Now they can rejoice as Roz and Bulldog pop up in the second season of the surprisingly charming sitcom sequel. Stream it on\nParamount Plus.\n2. Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story\nIt’s unclear why Serious Actor Javier Bardem is slumming it in Ryan Murphy’s newest ladleful of addictive true-crime slop (does Penélope need another villa?), but whatever, we’re grateful for the gravitas he’ll bring to the guilty-pleasure material. Murphy regular Chloë Sevigny is also in peak form, spitting out all-timers like “I regret having you — I could’ve been a movie star like Kim Novak and you’re what I got?” Stream it on\nNetflix.\n3. The Penguin\nWe’re not much for comic adaptations, but we’ll make an exception for the chance to gawk at the truly eye-popping prosthetic work and actorly skill that turn notable hot person Colin Farrell into the uggo supervillain lumbering to the top of Gotham’s underworld. Stream it on\nCrave.\n4. The Queen of Villains\nDid you know Japan has a massive wrestling culture? Take a peek inside this fascinating scene as the mousy Kaoru Matsumoto (Yuriyan Retriever) adopts the wild new heel persona of “Dump” to make it in the competitive women’s wrestling game in the ’80s, becoming the country’s most hated woman in the process. And it’s based on a true story, too! Stream it on\nhttps://www.netflix.com/search?q=The%20Queen%20of%20Villains&jbv=81351263.\n5. A Very Royal Scandal\nEarlier this year, Netflix released “Scoop,” which detailed how BBC Two secured its rep-destroying sit-down between Prince Andrew and “Newsnight” host Emily Maitlis. In a serious déjà-vu moment, Prime has another retelling of this story, this time in series form, featuring Michael Sheen as the prince and “The Affair” MVP Ruth Wilson as the dogged reporter, with more of a focus on Maitlis herself. Stream it on\nPrime Video.\n6. Paid in Full: The Battle for Black Music\nIdris Elba executive produces and Jully Black narrates this sobering series about how often Black artists get screwed over in the music industry, from copyright disputes to shady contracts. Interviewees include Chaka Khan, George Clinton, Gloria Gaynor, Ice T, Smokey Robinson and\nlocal treasure Cadence Weapon. Stream it Saturday on CBC Gem.\n7. The Traitors Canada\nThe faithfuls gather once more in TV’s most devious reality show to ferret out who are their fellow faithful — and who’s a traitor secretly gunning to bring them all down. This season, we’re rooting for messy marvel Melinda Verga of “Canada’s Drag Race” and comedian Tranna. Stream it Monday at 10 p.m. at\nCTV.ca and on the CTV app.\n8. Brilliant Minds\nZachary Quinto may be on our naughty list due to his\nallegedly causing a scene at Ossington hot spot Manita earlier this year (tsk tsk!), but we are here for anything based on the work of Oliver Sacks, the pioneering neurologist and author (previous books were made into “Awakenings” and “At First Sight”). Quinto plays a doctor inspired by Sacks, complete with face blindness and an unorthodox style of patient treatment. Steam it Monday at 10 p.m. at citytv.com and Citytv Plus.\n9. Penelope\nThe Duplass brothers return to TV with the quiet little YA story of a 16-year-old who strikes out into the forest for a little adventure and to find out who she really is. The towering trees of Washington state will have you hankering for a jaunt out west yourself. Stream it Tuesday on\nhttps://www.netflix.com.\n10. Midnight Family\nMed school is utterly exhausting. Now imagine working nights as a paramedic to boot. Renata Vaca stars as the workhorse Marigaby, who is torn between dedicating herself to her new studies and continuing to work alongside her clan of paramedic lifers in Mexico City’s underserved communities, including her jolly papa (Joaquín Cosío of “Narcos: Mexico” and “The Strain”), rebellious older brother (“Babylon”’s Diego Calva) and sassy little brother (Sergio “Kiko” Bautista). Inspired by the documentary of the same name. Stream it Wednesday on\nApple TV Plus.\n11. Mr. McMahon\nOn the one hand, Vince McMahon is one the most successful entertainment magnates in history, single-handedly turning the WWE into a multibillion-dollar enterprise. On the other hand, his legacy has been riddled with controversy. This docuseries delves into his career highs and lows. Stream it Wednesday on\nhttps://www.netflix.com/search?q=Mr.%20McMahon&jbv=81048394.\n12. OceanXplorers\nCool job alert: the crew of the OceanXplorer spend their workdays underwater, studying whales and tracking sharks, among other fascinating activities in the name of science. Tag along on their seaside adventures and get to know a little bit of the vast territory of the deep (80 per cent of oceans are still an uncharted mystery!). Stream it Wednesday on\nDisney Plus.\n13. The Knowing\nAnishinaabe author and journalist Tanya Talaga adds showrunner to her CV with this new docuseries about her family’s decades-long journey to track down their matriarch, and the residential schools and systemic racism that have torn Indigenous families apart. Stream it Wednesday on\nhttps://gem.cbc.ca/the-knowing.",
