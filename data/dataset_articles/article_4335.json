  "text": "Punjab launches Pakistan's first green policing unit with electric patrol cars\nPakistan\nChief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif was given a detailed briefing on the Green Policing Unit and the electric vehicles.\nLAHORE (Dunya News) – Punjab has earned the distinction of introducing the country’s first electric vehicle–based police patrolling system. Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif formally inaugurated Pakistan’s first Green Policing Unit.\nThe chief minister inspected the electric patrol vehicle of the Green Policing Unit and personally drove it. Lahore will be the first city where modern BYD electric vehicles will be used for traffic and police patrolling.\nOn the occasion, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif was given a detailed briefing on the Green Policing Unit and the electric vehicles.\nDuring the briefing, it was shared that the environment-friendly electric vehicle has a range of 410 kilometers on a single charge and can be fast-charged from 30 to 80 percent in approximately 30 minutes. The vehicle is equipped with a modern surveillance PA system, police lights, a 360-degree camera, and speed detection equipment.\nIt was further stated that 103 patrol vehicles currently in use consume 28,000 liters of fuel per month at a cost of 7.42 million rupees. Each electric vehicle will save approximately 4,500 liters of fuel annually, reduce operational costs, and ensure zero carbon emissions.\nChief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif directed that the number of electric vehicles for the Green Policing Unit be increased gradually and ordered steps to expand the unit to other districts in phases.\nShe said that the use of electric vehicles will reduce fuel expenses and result in zero carbon emissions, adding that green policing reflects the vision of clean air and good governance.",
