  "text": "The Great American Sh*t Show will be presented 7:00pm, Thursdays, September 26, and October 3 at The Marsh Berkeley and October 10 and 24 at The Marsh San Francisco. The Marsh will present the return of Brian Copeland’s The Great American Sh*t Show. Originally created by Brian Copeland in collaboration with [Charlie Varon](/people/Charlie-Varon/) as a duet, the show is now performed solo by Copeland. This collection of monologues on life in the Age of Trump explores a range of topics, including navigating family dynamics with a Trump supporter, the idea of when America was last “great,” #MeToo, and more. The Great American Sh*t Show will be presented 7:00pm, Thursdays, September 26, and October 3 at The Marsh Berkeley and October 10 and 24 at The Marsh San Francisco. The Great American Sh*t Show originated with Brian Copeland performing a 15-minute monologue at The Marsh San Francisco, describing the day after the 2016 presidential election. While Copeland was driving on the Bay Bridge, a bearded white man driving a Prius pulled up next to Copeland and yelled, “N****r!” “I haven’t been called that word in years,” Copeland noted. “Years actually. But on that day, the day after [Donald Trump](/people/Donald-Trump/) is elected president, it’s almost like the Prius driver was granted permission.” Collaborator [Charlie Varon](/people/Charlie-Varon/) said, “Brian’s monologue was equal parts truth, pain, and comedy. I left the theater disturbed and invigorated. A few days later, I called Brian and suggested we do a show together. He said yes, and we got busy writing.” As a duet, Copeland and Varon performed The Great American Sh*t Show to sold-out audiences at The Marsh, with the material evolving in response to unfolding political events. The audience reaction was electrifying, with one member describing the show as “much-needed catharsis. Finally, someone saying all the things we have been feeling during the sh*t show.” The San Francisco Chronicle praised the show as “smart, funny, provocative, and at times, unexpectedly deeply moving,” while Marinscope Newspapers lauded Copeland and Varon as “incredible storytellers.” Videos",
