  "text": "Tom Brady Names Bucs as Top 5 NFL Team 7-time Super Bowl champion turned [broadcaster](https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/tampa-bay-buccaneers-news/bucs-games-tom-brady-fox-2024-schedule) Tom Bradyâ€” and the last QB to hoist the Lombardi Trophy as a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers â€” recently did a segment for FOX where he unveiled his Power Rankings of the top 5 teams in the NFL heading into Week 3. Although Brady's broadcasting skills have received mixed reviews, his knowledge of the NFL, and more specifically, what makes a great team, cannot be disputed. Not only did Brady list the [Bucs ](https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/news/tampa-bay-buccaneers-still-need-to-fix-their-running-game)as one of the five best teams in the NFL right now, but he took it a step further and listed them as one of his top 3.

They got revenge from their playoff loss last year in Week 2 vs. the Lions. They played a great game. Defense was the definition of bend don't break. The Lions were one of seven in the red zone. They picked off Goff twice and they played great defense when it mattered most.\" Brady believes, at least based on what the [Bucs](https://www.si.com/nfl/buccaneers/news/tampa-bay-buccaneers-deemed-contenders-among-nfl-undefeated-teams) have put on tape so far this season, that only the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills are better. Some may suggest Brady is showing his bias as a former Buccaneer, but I don't see the New England Patriots â€” who dominated the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 1 â€” on this list.
