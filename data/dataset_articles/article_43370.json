  "text": "OAKLAND — Forester Melissa Nash has received the National Field Forester Award from the USDA Forest Service and the National Association of State Foresters. She serves as the Garrett/Allegany project manager for the Maryland Forest Service of the Department of Natural Resources. The award is given to those who have made a significant contribution toward advancing the Forest Stewardship and Rural Forestry Assistance Program across the landscape. Nominees have demonstrated exceptional leadership and service, consistently delivered a strong program that is a model for other foresters, and found innovative approaches to providing technical assistance to landowners and partners. Nash was previously recognized as the Maryland Forester of the Year and Northeast-Midwest State Foresters Alliance Forester of the Year in 2020. “I’m honored,” Nash said. “I just found out about the award about a week or so beforehand, so it was a pleasant surprise. It means a lot to have my work recognized. I’ve also had a lot of support and been a part of many great partnerships that have enabled me to do the work I’ve done.” Nash graduated from Allegany College of Maryland with an AAS in Forest Technology (2008) and WVU with a BS in Forest Resource Management (2010). She began working seasonally for the Maryland Forest Service at Green Ridge State Forest while still in school. In 2011, she was hired full time as a watershed forester. She worked in Maryland’s four western counties with private landowners on buffer planting projects, coordinated the Backyard Buffers program and coordinated management activities on the Frederick City Watershed. “In 2015, I accepted the Garrett County Project Manager position for the Maryland Forest Service, where I have been providing management assistance and support to 350+ private landowners on 20,000+ acres,” Nash said. This includes helping landowners plan tree planting projects, giving recommendations for commercial and non-commercial forest harvest operations, invasive plant control and prescribing burning, wildfire response, educational and outreach programs. In her current position, Nash also serves as secretary of the Garrett County Forestry Board. In 2023, the Garrett and Allegany projects were merged into the Garrett-Allegany Project, so she now oversees the stewardship staff in both counties. “I get to meet a lot of interesting people,” Nash said in speaking about her favorite part of the job. “Some have a long family history with their property to share, while others may be new forest landowners. They all have goals for the future and I’m able to help them achieve those goals.” Nash noted that sometimes this does take time or she may have to get creative and utilize multiple/different funding sources and involve different partners. “But it’s really rewarding to come back a few years down the road and see a tree planting, invasive plant control or thinning project and how their forest has benefitted from it,” she said. Nash said she grew up near Frostburg, but spent a lot of time in Garrett County as a kid, especially fishing with her Granddad. She’s lived near Grantsville since 2014. “My husband Kenny and I typically spend our free time centered around our hunting dogs,” she said. “We have Bluetick coonhounds and Mountain Feist squirrel dogs. We enjoy hunting locally for raccoon and squirrel and also travel frequently to participate in show and hunt performance events with our dogs. We are active in local hunting clubs in Maryland and Pennsylvania.” The couple also enjoys fishing, camping and foraging for mushrooms. Nash volunteers with the 4-H program in the county and have been a 4-H volunteer for 15 years.",
