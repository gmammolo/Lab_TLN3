  "text": "Henderson, Tennessee — (Sept. 19, 2024) — Freed-Hardeman University’s Physical Therapist Assistant (PTA) program recently completed a transformative medical missions trip to Honduras from July 27 to August 3, 2024. Collaborating with Misión Para Cristo, an organization dedicated to sharing Jesus and serving people in Nicaragua, Haiti and Honduras since 1997, the group of six PTA students and three licensed physical therapists provided essential care to underserved communities.\nThe team worked at The Good Samaritan School, known as “Kingdom Kids,” under the direction of Benny Baker. The school, which serves impoverished children by providing education, food, medicine and care, almost faced closure in 2016 but has continued to thrive through support and dedication. The mission also included service at Predisan Hospital, where students delivered much-needed physical therapy to patients who otherwise lack access to healthcare.\nImpactful Experiences\n“Our goal is to make this trip an annual event,” said Brian Vaughn PT, M.Ed. director of clinical education at the Freed-Hardeman University PTA program. “Through our partnership with Harding’s PT department, we ensure that patients are seen at least twice a year. Our mission is to serve the physical needs of the community first, demonstrating Christ through our actions and service.”\nThe students’ experiences were deeply impactful and eye-opening. Senior Noah Johnson described how witnessing the living conditions in Honduras reshaped his perspective, stating, “It was eye-opening to see the living conditions in Honduras compared to America. Treating the patients and seeing their reactions made me realize this is the career I want to pursue – possibly even on an international level.”\nJoshua Puente echoed this sentiment, highlighting the power of resourcefulness: “We accomplished so much with limited equipment, proving that physical therapy doesn’t always require advanced tools. It reinforced how impactful our work can be even with the basics.”\nGrace Bennett reflected on the patients’ appreciation, saying, “This trip shifted my perspective. The patients’ appreciation, despite having so little, was humbling. It made me want to give even more, though we had to adapt to the limited time and resources.”\nBrylie Johnson added, “This mission felt different because we directly impacted hundreds of individuals. Even small improvements in patients were incredibly rewarding.”\nAnna Kate Norton, participating in her first mission trip, found the experience enlightening, sharing that it made her more conscious of the disparities in healthcare access. “It was very eye-opening and really touched my heart. Being able to do just a little was big to them, and it made me grateful for what we have here.”\nChase Daniel also shared a memorable encounter with a patient who had been told she needed surgery but was able to avoid it with proper therapy, emphasizing the tangible impact of their work: “Being able to tell her that you don’t necessarily need surgery just lit her face up. She had been saving for surgery that would have cost far more than she could afford, and it was rewarding to know we could help her avoid that.”\nA Broader Vision of Service\nThe PTA students conducted screenings for over 400 children, assessing balance, strength and other physical health indicators, and worked in clinics to provide care for adult patients. This service was critical in a country where 18 percent of the population lacks access to healthcare, and 90 percent of people have no insurance coverage.\nThis trip serves as an additional opportunity for students to put their clinical skills and knowledge into practice while being immersed in a diverse cultural environment,” Vaughn added. “Next year, we plan to expand our efforts by including pre-med students and construction teams, aiming to make an even greater impact.”\nAbout Misión Para Cristo\nMisión Para Cristo operates in Nicaragua, Haiti and Honduras, striving to promote physical, spiritual, social and economic health according to God’s plan. The organization’s mission is to bring wholeness to communities by meeting physical needs first, creating opportunities for spiritual outreach.\nThis partnership between Freed-Hardeman University, Harding University and Misión Para Cristo exemplifies how service-based healthcare can bring, not just physical healing, but also hope and encouragement to those in need.\nFor more information on supporting or joining future missions, visit misionparacristo.com\nThe mission of Freed-Hardeman University is to help students develop their God-given talents for His glory by empowering them with an education that integrates Christian faith, scholarship and service.
