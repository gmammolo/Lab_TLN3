  "text": "Together for a Cure: Fundraising Event Aims to Unite the Community for Breast Cancer Research and Support\nSusan G. Komen ® , the world’s leading breast cancer organization, today announced it will host a MORE THAN PINK Walk this Fall. The Walk will take place on Saturday, November 2, 2024, bringing together survivors, supporters and advocates to raise critical funds to advance Komen’s mission and provide support for people facing this disease now.\nEvery 12 minutes, a woman in the U.S. dies from breast cancer. In 2024 alone, an estimated 23,290 women in Texas will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 3,280 will lose their lives to the disease. Experts say one-third of breast cancer deaths in the U.S. could be prevented with universal access to modern treatments. Funds raised at the Walk will allow Komen to meet the immediate needs of breast cancer patients through its free Breast Care Helpline and offer services such as patient navigation, financial assistance and emotional support. It will also fund research breakthroughs that allow more lives to be saved from breast cancer and bring us closer to the cures for all breast cancers.\nIn 2024, the Komen Financial Assistance program provided financial assistance totaling $1,257,750 to 2,267 people in Texas who are in breast cancer treatment or living with metastatic breast cancer. Additionally, Komen’s Patient Care Center provided 7,796 services to 6,259 people living in Texas, working to address 8,453 barriers to care that may otherwise prevent someone from getting the breast health care or support they need.\nThis year’s event will be held at Methodist Hospital | Westover Hills and will be the first public event held in the space. The new facility will be a full-service, acute care hospital designed to bring an elevated level of care to the San Antonio area and its neighboring communities and Walk participants will be the first to tour the new hospital and view the new facility.\nWe are excited to partner with Susan G. Komen this year for the San Antonio MORE THAN PINK Walk,” said Imelda Guzman, Director of DEI for Methodist Healthcare. “Methodist is committed to delivering high-quality patient care and ensuring that our services are accessible to everyone in need. Partnering with Susan G. Komen connects us to the individuals that we serve in the breast cancer community, and we look forward to a continued relationship where we can assist in their mission to end breast cancer for all.\n\"We are thrilled to welcome the community to the San Antonio MORE THAN PINK Walk this year, where together we can make a profound impact in the fight against breast cancer,\" said Monique Stensrud, Komen Executive Director for Central Texas. \"Supporting individuals in our community who are facing breast cancer is essential to our mission, but we cannot do it alone. This year’s Walk is not just an event; it is a pivotal moment to secure vital funds that will make equitable care available to all. We hope you can join us as we take a powerful stand against this devastating disease.\"\nWhat: San Antonio MORE THAN PINK Walk\nWhen: Saturday, November 2, 2024\nWhere : Methodist Hospital | Westover Hills, San Antonio, TX\nPark & Ride : Northwest Vista College\nRegistration Details: For registration details visit www.komen.org/sanantoniowalk\nThis year’s Walk is made possible by the following sponsors: Thomas J.
