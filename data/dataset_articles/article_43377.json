  "text": "Erika Torrejon loves Steamboat Springs. She has a wonderful community, a good life and has had a great career in education. But for Torrejon, who was born in Peru and came to the United states as a young adult, there was still something missing.\n“We grew up dancing, since preschool,” Torrejon said. “There are so many dances, from the jungle, the mountains, the coast, I don’t know how many. Probably hundreds. I’d been living in Steamboat for nine years — 10 now — and you crave that.”\nThere was another piece to that craving, she said.\n“Now I have daughters, and you can’t stop thinking, ‘How can they have what I had?'” she said. “I always felt there has to be a way to bring more of my culture to my girls.”\nThen she realized something.\n“I thought, ‘I bet all of these Peruvians are feeling the same,'” Torrejon recalled. “So I reach out to a friend, another Peruvian, and I talk to her and she says, ‘Yes, me too. I want to do it too.'”\nAnd it spread. Suddenly, there was a group of Peruvian dancers.\n“We were ready to do this,” she said. “We gather. We talk. What do we want to do?”\nThe purpose was clear: not to make money, not to make a business, but to get together and create community.\n“We crave that,” she said. “Even though we have community within the community, there’s nothing like being around people with that same sense of humor, that same way of talking.”\nThey picked a dance and the World Dance Collective was born.\n“We’re not professional dancers, but we grew up with this,” Torrejon said.\nFor Torrejon and the Collective, the opportunity to recall this visceral childhood experience, one deeply ingrained in their cultural heritage, awakened something. And not only something Peruvian.\n“There are a lot of countries that would like to show their culture,” she said. “We’re inviting all different countries to join us. Right now it’s Peruvian, but I’ve talked to Colombian friends, and even a woman from Bulgaria.”\nThe dancers have performed at Art in the Park and elsewhere, and there’s more to come. Steamboat Creates is coming up next.\nThe first dance they’ve worked to prepare for performance is Afro-Peruvian: Festejo. And its own history has a perhaps unintentional echo of what the troupe is doing now.\n“It’s a mix of native and African influence,” Torrejon said. “When the Spanish came to Peru, they brought slaves with them. The slaves didn’t have the instruments they were used to from home, so they adjusted, and it’s a mix of African and native Peruvian.”\nIn other words, it’s the dance and music of a people from one place, who were moved to another, mixing with the culture of a people who were there when they got there.\n“This is in us, it’s in our DNA,” Torrejon said. “We’re born and we listen to this, see it everywhere. It brings our culture close to us and it feels like home. It’s such a good feeling. I’m dancing with Peruvians from all over who I didn’t know three months ago. Now we’re family. I love them all, and it’s brought so much joy to my life.”\nAnd her own family is part of that family.\n“My daughters are dancing now, too,” Torrejon said. “And my mother, she’s doing it. There’s a part where we’re in a circle in the dance. My mom didn’t dance these dances—she’s seen them, listened to them —but I said do you want to dance? All of a sudden, I see this circle, my mom’s face looking at me, my daughter’s face, and we’re all dancing. And we just created this. It brings me a lot of joy.”\nFor more information, to join the World Dance Collective or to donate, email Erika at peruvianraices@gmail.com.\nSarah Meade is the collaborative partnerships manager ath the Health Partnership.",
