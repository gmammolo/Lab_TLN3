  "text": "Barron Trump has been praised after he saved a woman’s life by calling emergency services after witnessing her being violently assaulted during a FaceTime call.\nThe incident, which took place on January 18, 2025, came to light during a court trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court.\nThe 19-year-old son of President Donald Trump received a FaceTime call from a friend, whose identity has not been publicly revealed.\nDuring the call, Barron saw the woman's ex-boyfriend, 22-year-old Matvei Rumiantsev, repeatedly striking her, The Independent reported.\nIn a panic, he dialed 999, and urgently told the operator: \"I just got a call from a girl, I know.\n\"She's getting beaten up...It's really an emergency, please.\n\"I got a call from her with a guy beating her up.\"\nIn a tense moment on the call, Barron struggled to answer the operator's questions about his location and the details of the situation.\nAfter being reprimanded by the operator for not answering clearly, he apologized, stating: \"I met her on social media.\n\"She's getting really badly beat up and the call was about eight minutes ago, I don't know what could have happened by now,\" GB News cited.\nIn a recording of the call played in court, the teen described what he saw during the brief, 15-second FaceTime call: \"I just saw a ceiling and could hear screaming. I could see a guy’s head on the phone, and then the camera turns to her crying and getting hit,\" he said.\nHe added: \"I called you guys - that was the best thing I could do. I wasn’t going to call back and threaten things to him because that would just make the situation worse.\"\nDetails of the Assault and Police Response\nProsecutors at the trial revealed Rumiantsev allegedly became enraged after seeing the woman’s friendship with the president's son.\nDuring the FaceTime call, he was seen grabbing her hair, pushing her to the ground, and calling her derogatory names such as \"slut\" and \"whore.\"\nHe is also accused of kicking her in the stomach while she lay helpless on the floor.\nBarron's call to emergency services prompted officers to be dispatched to Rumiantsev's home in Poplar, east London.\nThe Impact on the Victim and Legal Proceedings\nThe alleged victim testified in court that Rumiantsev assaulted her after they got into an argument last January.\nIt was also disclosed that months later, she filed a complaint to cops that she’d been raped by him twice - the second assault occurring just hours before authorities responded to the January incident.\nThe suspect, who faces a range of charges including assault, actual bodily harm, two counts of rape, intentional strangulation, and perverting the course of justice, denies all accusations.\nProsecutors claim that he tried to trick officers into allowing him to phone the woman from custody and later sent a letter through a friend urging her to retract her statement.\nInitially, she withdrew her complaint, but later retracted that decision, reaffirming her original account.\nDuring cross-examination, she was questioned about her claim that Barron “saved” her, and she stood by her testimony, saying: “He helped save my life. That call was like a sign from God at that moment.”",
