  "text": "After a 20-year break, the Southeastern Conference will relaunch the SEC Volleyball Championship beginning in 2025 and has signed a three-year agreement to host the event at Enmarket Arena in Savannah, Georgia. The 2025 tournament is slated to take place on November 21–25, 2025, at Enmarket Arena. In addition, upcoming tournaments at the venue are scheduled for November 20–24, 2026, and November 19–23, 2027. “With the restoration of the SEC Volleyball Tournament, we will now host a championship event in every conference sport, providing our programs additional competitive opportunities as they prepare for NCAA postseason competition,” said [SEC](https://www.sportstravelmagazine.com/tag/sec/) Commissioner Greg Sankey. “We look forward to providing a memorable experience for SEC student-athletes, coaches and fans as we make Savannah home to the SEC Volleyball Tournament for the next three years.” The SEC Volleyball Championship previously took place from 1979 to 2005. The tournament was held on campus sites from 1979–1987 and 1994–2005, while the event took place at neutral locations from 1988–1993. Earlier tournament champions include Florida (12 titles), Kentucky (5), LSU and Tennessee (4 each) and Arkansas and Georgia (1 each). “Welcoming the SEC Women’s Volleyball Championships for the next three years marks one of Savannah’s most significant sports milestones,” said Joseph Marinelli, president and chief executive officer of [Visit Savannah](https://www.sportstravelmagazine.com/tag/visit-savannah/) and [Savannah Sports Council](https://www.sportstravelmagazine.com/tag/savannah-sports-council/). “Hosting these exceptional athletes and this prestigious event is a tremendous honor for our city. It will draw visitors nationwide and provide fun, inspirational family entertainment for our community and Low Country.” Enmarket Arena, which is a part of the [Oak View Group](https://sportstravelmagazine.com/tag/oak-view-group/), is a multi-purpose complex that opened in February 2022. It includes a 9,500-seat arena and is home to the Savannah Ghost Pirates of the East Coast Hockey League. “We at OVG are thrilled to host the SEC Volleyball Tournament at Enmarket Arena and we thank the SEC for choosing us as the site of the championship these next few years,” said Monty Jones Jr., general manager of Enmarket Arena. “Our partnership with Visit Savannah and the Savannah Sports Council underscores our commitment to bringing high-caliber sports to Savannah and will help elevate Savannah’s status as a premier destination for major sports and entertainment.” The Savannah Convention Center will serve as the official practice facility for the tournament. “The Savannah Convention Center is proud to be the official practice facility for the 2025, 2026, and 2027 SEC Volleyball Tournaments,” said Kelvin Moore, senior vice president and general manager of the Savannah Convention Center. “We’re excited to showcase our newly expanded venue, now better equipped to host even more premier sporting events.”",
