  "text": "Last year, Skyler Kling, a sixth-grade social studies and language arts teacher at Steamboat Springs Middle School, had her students conduct a research project on how the environment shapes culture.\nAfter the research, Kling challenged her students to conduct a “Call to Action” and write a letter to an organization related to their research and cause. Owen David went right to the top and sent a letter to President Biden regarding the importance of incorporating more culture into schools. As a result, Owen received correspondence from President Biden.\nDear Owen,\nThank you for sharing your thoughts with me. Vice President Harris and I love hearing from students. Even at your age, you have the power to change the future and make history.\nOur country faces many challenges, and the work we have ahead of us is going to be really tough. I’m certain that if we set aside our differences and come together as a Nation, we will make positive change. It won’t be easy, and I’m going to need your help.\nI urge you to remain curious, creative, and fearless. Students like you are the future of our great Nation, and it’s important that you speak up on issues that matter most. When you make your voice heard, adults listen.\nI wish you the best in the years ahead, and I look forward to seeing where your future takes you. Study hard. Keep challenging yourself. And be kind.\nSincerely, Joe Biden\nOwen said he wasn’t expecting to get a response from President Biden but was excited and proud of himself when he did. He wants more celebrations of culture around the U.S., especially in schools and the letter encouraged him to keep pursuing his cause. The letter is now framed and prominently displayed in Owen’s house.\nSPE fifth-grade camping trip Fifth-grade students from Strawberry Park Elementary work together to navigate a ropes course during a recent field trip to Snow Mountain Ranch. Steamboat Springs School District/Courtesy photo Fifth graders at Strawberry Park Elementary recently had a fantastic trip to Snow Mountain Ranch. This was an incredible learning experience and a chance to connect and build trust and community with their classmates.\nThe students worked together to set up their own tents, practice “Leave No Trace” principles and challenge themselves on the low ropes course. Students learned about being independent and responsible and how to lean on each other when needed.\nThe trip would not have been possible without the support of Assistant Principal Jaime Passchier, Strawberry Park fifth-grade teachers and all the families and parent chaperones. Thank you to all those who supported the event, giving their time and energy to support the students.\nStudents from Strawberry Park Elementary enjoy working on projects during a recent trip to Snow Mountain Ranch.

They earned a Meets Expectation on Postsecondary Readiness and Academic Achievement and an Approaching Expectations on Academic Growth.\nFor more information, read the full story on SSSD’s website.\nUpdate on affordable housing\nWe are committed to addressing the affordable housing needs of Steamboat Springs School District staff and want to update you on recent developments.\nWe recently secured a Department of Local Affairs grant to assist in creating a request for proposals for affordable housing. However, as of Aug. 30, the Colorado Division of Housing has issued a stop-work order on this technical assistance due to state budget issues. This pause is beyond our control.\nWhile unsure how long the stop-work order will last, we are exploring alternative options, including developing on property owned by Steamboat Springs School District next to Sleeping Giant School. We are collaborating with Paul Major from Rural Homes Colorado to evaluate the sites, and we expect the results in late October or early November.\nThese findings will help us assess the feasibility of potential affordable housing on these properties. Additionally, we will carefully consider all options regarding the Whistler Park property as part of our broader efforts to address these housing challenges after receiving the final feasibility study from Rural Homes Colorado.\nCeline Wicks is the superintendent for the Steamboat Springs School District.",
