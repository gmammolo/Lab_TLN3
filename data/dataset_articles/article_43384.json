  "text": "As our short growing season is coming to an end, here is a collection of top tips collected from Routt County Master Gardeners.\nNever give up on a transplanted plant. Keep watering and you may be surprised after a long winter. The plant may look barely alive in the fall, but by the next spring — if watered — will be a blooming plant. This also works for some bulbs. Nancy Porter, MG 2017\nDon’t water houseplants on a schedule — check them on a schedule and only water when the soil actually needs it. Specifically, jade plants do best with much less water than you think. Depending on the size of the pot and how much sun that plant gets, that could mean watering only once a month. They don’t seem to mind some benign neglect, making them an excellent houseplant choice for haphazard inside gardeners like me. Ali Mignone, MG 2024\nWhen I plant a tree, I plant a small viola or violet even a pansy next to it as an “indicator.” If the small flower starts to look dry or stressed, I can tell something is wrong sooner than later and, most importantly, before it affects the tree. Stephanie Appel MG 2024\nIf you need to encourage marmots to move on, try putting a cordless radio on loud in their hole. It takes a while for them to get the idea, but it does seem to work. Adele Carlson, MG 2020\nIt is okay to use weed killer on rock crevices to rid your rocks of weeds, especially if you have a big garden. Nancy Porter, MG 2017\nThe soil here is a challenge and the growing season is especially short in Steamboat so it’s particularly important to effectively adapt to the conditions. Choosing plants that are native to the region is a great strategy for finding the right plants to fit the right places. Logan Molen, MG 2024\nCheck your soil moisture and PH often and adjust your management regimes accordingly. Our clay soils are so unforgiving. Regenerating our soils regenerates entire ecosystems. Simply adding fertilizer then mining it off again in the form of harvests doesn’t do much for soil health long term. Nancie McCormish, MG 2024\nRaised Beds: Plan for wildlife invasion by lining your raised beds with hardware cloth before putting in your soil. Make sure your beds are high enough to save your back and no wider than 3 feet to easily reach across. Install a high fence so deer can’t interfere. Plan for season extensions with simple rebar, PVC piping, frost cloth and clips. You should also consider installing some type of irrigation system. Tracy Zuschlag, MG 2000\nYou can grow vegetables here in the Yampa Valley, even tomatoes and pumpkins. Choose short-season varieties of the crops you want and start them inside to extend your growing season. I’ve been harvesting “Beaverlodge” tomatoes with a 55-day maturation for more than a month. I’ve also harvested “Cinnamon Girl” pumpkins, which are small pie pumpkins delicious in baked goods. Becky Edmiston CMG 2018\nAlthough I’ve read that both cucumbers and sunflowers don’t like their roots messed with so it’s better to direct seed them; after failed crops the last two years (mostly because of critters eating the seeds) I started seeds inside this year and transplanted the seedlings out when they were about 3 inches tall. It worked great. Adele Carlson, MG 2020\nAs you are doing fall garden cleanup, try not to toss weed seeds around or put in compost piles. I try to segregate them, and they go in plastic trash bags and get removed from the site. Ditto some flowering plants that are pretty but are pretty much taking over — I practice birth control this time of year by cutting off and removing the seeds. Plants I want more of, I do the same, but will toss around or stratify over winter then spread into new locations. Nancie McCormish MG 2024",
