  "text": "What does the recent sale drama of the Boston Celtics tell us about the future of the team? [Justin Quinn](/staff/74879608007/justin-quinn/) What does the drama over the potential sale of the [Boston Celtics](https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/basketball/nba/teams/boston-celtics/2/) tell us about the future of the team? When news broke in the New York Post this week about some trouble in paradise in terms of the Grousbeck family reportedly being at odds about the swiftly ballooning payroll of the storied ball club, the reasoning for the sale began to take on a new feel. The hosts of the CLNS Media \"Still Poddable\" podcast, Brian Robb, Sam Packard, and Jay King, took some time on a recent episode of their show to look at the New York Post article and what it could mean for the potential sale of the team and its hopes of hanging Banner 19 at the end of the NBA's 2024-25 regular season ahead. Take a look at the clip embedded below to hear what they had to say about how the news might change the future of this team's contention arc as the penalties of the league's new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) start to take hold.
