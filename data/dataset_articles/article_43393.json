  "text": "There’s something delightful about having a flask of your favorite tipple on hand when you’re out and about. And while the most common use for a flask is carrying spirits like whiskey or brandy, if you’re feeling adventurous then you can also try your hand at flask cocktails . Given that this is Negroni Week, today I’m sharing my personal favorite recipe for a negroni on the go.\nHow to make a flask negroni I have a flask of about 200ml, but you can adjust this recipe up or down for the size of your flask.\nIngredients:\n50 ml gin (I like to use Tanqueray, but you can use whatever you prefer) 50 ml Campari 70 ml sweet vermouth (I’m using good old Martini & Rossi, but again you can use your preferred brand) 30 ml water generous dash of orange bitters Method:\nRecommended Videos Rather than attempting to mix the ingredients directly in the flask, which is messy and annoying, it’s easier to mix everything in a kitchen jug. Pour everything in and mix well, then taste to see if it needs any tweaks. If not, use a funnel to pour it into the flask and enjoy your negroni on the go.\nRelated How to make pour-over coffee to complete your perfect morning routine The best blended Scotch worth trying this fall Ardbeg released the latest batch of its 19-year-old single malt whisky The art of flask cocktails The trick to making a good flask cocktail is understanding how to mix a room temperature drink. Virtually all traditional cocktails are drunk chilled, but with a flask cocktail, even if you start with chilled ingredients, you’ll end up with a warm drink after carrying it around with you all day. So you need to adjust your recipes to account for that.\nThe biggest factors to allow for with a room temperature drink are water and sweetness.\nIt may seem odd to add water to a cocktail, but think about shaking or stirring a cocktail with ice — this doesn’t only chill the drink, it also melts the ice into water which is an essential part of a balanced drink. If you made a negroni using the traditional ingredients but didn’t stir it with ice and drank it at room temperature, it would taste harsh and unbalanced. Stirring a drink adds around 15-20% of water to its volume, so you want to add this much water into your flask cocktail too.\nThe other issue to consider is sweetness. When a drink is chilled, its flavors tend to be rather muted. Chilling spirits helps to round off their harsh edges — just think of throwing a bottle of vodka into the freezer before doing shots to make them smoother. If a drink isn’t going to be chilled, it is going to taste more boozy and less mellow. To counteract that, I like to add more sweetener to room temperature drinks than I normally would.\nIn the case of a flask negroni, that means upping the proportion of sweet vermouth as this is the main sweetner in the drink. The exact ratio can be adjusted to your liking, but I like to add around one third more of the sweet vermouth than I would normally, changing the traditional ratios of 1:1:1 for this drink.\nEditors’ Recommendations Hennessy Cognac and Lebron James unite to launch a limited-edition expression Bird Creek Whiskey’s new releases are made with rare barley types Gray Whale Gin launches limited edition whale-shaped pitcher Keeper’s Heart Whiskey just released a 21-year-old Irish single malt For great cocktails, you need to squeeze your citrus",
