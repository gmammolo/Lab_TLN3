  "text": "OK, so this is not a secret—I’m a self-proclaimed hack enthusiast, especially when they\nsave time and ramp up efficiency! But have I ever gushed about my love for planners? As a teacher, leaving my trusty bullet-point planner behind felt like heading out without a limb. Even during my rookie years, I clung to my lesson plans like a lifeline, making sure I wouldn’t miss a beat.\nNow, as I’ve embraced my seasoned wisdom, I’m slowly transitioning to the digital planner realm (though I haven’t completely ditched my physical one—old habits die hard!), especially when I remember all the times I tried to handwrite my documentation of parent contacts in that overstuffed planner. Let me tell you, I’m all about this fantastic planner hack that TikToker\n@alldayapril has been sharing with teachers to make documenting parent contact a breeze.\nShe uses Google Sheets—linked to her planner and student accommodations list—to document parent contact quickly, efficiently, and in one place.\nAt around 1:43 in her video, @alldayapril explains how she uses a parent contact log to track every time she communicates with a parent. She integrates this log into her digital planner, which helps her keep everything organized. This system is especially useful if a parent hasn’t responded, allowing her to easily reference her attempts to reach out. It’s a simple way to ensure that all communication is thoroughly documented and nothing slips through the cracks.\nAre you a little stumbled up on the step about linking Google Forms to her digital Google Sheets planner? Don’t worry, we’ve got you. I love that\nthis video is spelled out step-by-step, too, because sometimes I really need it broken down! Here are the steps:\nHere’s how to do it yourself!\n1. Create digital planner calendar on Google Sheets\nLook at how cute this calendar is!\n2. Click responses from Google Forms, and then click “Link to Sheets”\nSo far, so good!\n3. “Select existing spreadsheet” and click on the Google Sheets you want to link to\nIn this case, it’s called the 23/24 Digital Planner for\n@alldayapril.\n4. Change the name of your form at the bottom of your sheet, and format your sheet to your liking\nHow far you want to format your new sheet is just personal preference. I know I like all my fonts to match!\nFeeling overwhelmed creating something cute and functional from scratch? Check out All Day April’s ready-made templates on\nTeachers Pay Teachers.\nIn wrapping up, embracing this digital planner hack not only simplifies your teaching life but also injects some fun into your organizational habits. Whether you’re a digital newbie or a seasoned pro,\n@alldayapril’s tips ensure your transition to digital planning is smooth, visually appealing, and efficient. So, what do you think? Utilize digital planners and watch your calendar planning increase in efficiency!",
