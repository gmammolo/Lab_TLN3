  "text": "A record number of runners raised a record sum for the fight against cancer at the Luxembourg Times BusinessRun on Thursday.\nMore than 6,600 runners from more than 400 companies put on their trainers on Thursday evening for a 5km run through the heart of Luxembourg City’s business district in Kirchberg.\nWith the sun slowing setting, Luxembourg Times editor-in-chief Cordula Schnuer rang the starting signal at 19:00.\n“It’s great to see so many people come together for a good cause,” she said. “We’re proud to be part of this event that is all about team spirit and reaching a common goal.”\nWith €2 of every registration fee collected for charity, the BusinessRun raised €36,262 for the Fondation Cancer, which support cancers patients and their families in Luxembourg as well as funding research in the fight to prevent and cure the disease.\nThe fastest teams were rewarded with special prizes, with awards handed to:\nSauerBeen Asport – with Gil Weicherding, Bob Bertemes and Luc Scheller - for the fastest men’s team,\nLes Gazelles de l’INLL – with Elsa Eiller, Silvia Cano and Sabrina Masciocchi - the fastest women’s team,\nPwC Team 2- with Joffrey Perrot-Legros, Yohan Maurin and Emma Waechter - the fastest mixed team.\nThe INLL and PwC teams upheld their company record, with teams from both organisations also winning last year.\nSpeed wasn’t the only winning formula though. The Gym Tonics received the prize for the most creative team name, while runners dressed in Titanic costume were rewarded for the best costume.\nThe Chamber of Skilled Trades of Crafts sponsored a special Handwierk prize, which went to Gio-Go Go (Nelson Ferraz, Antonio Barros and Natalia Faria).\nThe latest edition of the run broke last year’s record when 5,400 runners participated.\nWith the after party getting in full swing, the Luxembourg Times hosted hundreds of thirsty and hungry runners to fuel the crowd.\nBNP Paribas once again sent the largest team into the race, with 680 employees from the company taking part, up from 291 last year. Clearstream followed in second place with 292 runners and ArcelorMittal coming third with 161.\nMore pictures to follow",
