  "text": "LANSING, Mich. (WNEM) - A fifth grader from DeWitt won two tickets to the Super Bowl LIX as a part of the American Heart Association’s Kids Heart Challenge program. The American Heart Association, in collaboration with the NFL and the Detroit Lions, awarded the tickets to Roman Lopez, a student at Herbison Woods Elementary School in DeWitt. He was surprised with his tickets at his school last week along with a Detroit Lions “swag bag.” Roman, along with four other winners from across the U.S., was selected as a winner after he completed the Kids Heart Challenge Hands-Only CPR online learning module. In support of the program, the NFL included an introduction video to the module made by Damar Hamlin, who is a safety for the Buffalo Bills and a cardiac arrest survivor. Related: Going home: Bills’ Hamlin released from Buffalo hospital In Hamlin’s video, which appears before the learning module begins, he shares how CPR saved his life and he encourages children to learn the lifesaving skill. The American Heart Association said its collaboration with the NFL is its most recent demonstration of the vow to CPR education with the commitment to double survival rates of cardiac emergencies by 2030. Nearly three out of four cardiac arrests happen outside of the hospital at home, so knowing how to perform CPR is critically important. Click here for more information on how you can learn CPR.
