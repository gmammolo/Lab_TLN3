The acronym stands for \"automatic prohibited item detection systems\". This technology uses artificial intelligence to help aviation security personnel evaluate x-ray images by automatically detecting items that aren't allowed in carry-on luggage. The on-site security check personnel make the final decisions on how to deal with them.\n\"By introducing APIDS, we're defining a new standard of aviation security,\" says Alexander Laukenmann, Fraport AG's Senior Executive Vice President for Aviation. \"The system provides valuable support to our security personnel, enabling them to make more precise checks more efficiently and helping to additionally raise the already high standard of security at Frankfurt Airport. With strategic foresight, the German Federal Ministry of the Interior defined certification requirements that have facilitated fast, smooth implementation in collaboration with the German Federal Police.\"\nAPIDS is now being used in all of the airport's terminals for a total of more than 50 CT scanners from Smiths Detection. With this large-scale rollout, Fraport is now also leading the way in Europe. The new system had been thoroughly tested beforehand at Frankfurt Airport within the scope of a test phase enabled by the European Union. Attention focused on determining its suitability for use and integrating it into the overall process. Close collaboration among Fraport, the German Federal Police and the German Federal Ministry of the Interior enabled its successful national certification, thus paving the way for its operational deployment.\nKerstin Kohlmetz, President of the Federal Police Office at Frankfurt Airport, says: \"On the basis of joint intensive testing of the APID system over the course of several months, Fraport AG and the German Federal Police were able to obtain valuable results from its ongoing operation. These then played an important role in getting it certified and approved for use. Once again, we have achieved a successful result by closely collaborating in the field of innovative aviation security technology.\"\nSince assuming responsibility for the management of aviation security checks, Fraport has so far invested around €50 million to install new, innovatively designed security check lanes and equip them with state-of-the-art CT technology. In this way, Fraport is steadily driving the further development of the aviation security checkpoints for passengers and their luggage at Frankfurt Airport.\nYou can find more information on the responsibilities at the aviation security checks at Frankfurt Airport in this infographic .\nPress Contact Maria Linden Communications Manager - Airside and Terminal Operations\n+49 69 690 - 70557 m.linden@fraport.de A print-quality photo is available here AEM APIDS\nJPG, 4 MB Press Archive Press Releases\nPress Releases Attachments\nOriginal document Permalink Disclaimer\nFraport AG published this content on January 22, 2026 , and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.
