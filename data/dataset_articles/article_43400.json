  "text": "Archive renovation at UAA helps preserve Alaska's stories Before the work, the archive was 90% full ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - The Archives and Special Collections at the University of Alaska Anchorage/Alaska Pacific University Consortium Library is located on the third floor of the University of Alaska Anchorage library. A year and a half ago, they faced a large problem. The vault was at 90% capacity. They were running out of room. Today, thanks to a year-long $1 million renovation, they have some room to breathe. The work included an updated sprinkler system, covering over two windows to block out damaging sunlight and replacing all of the shelving with high-density storage shelving. That’s a large undertaking. Everything had to be removed from the vault and put into storage; almost 7,000 boxes. Once the new shelving was in place those boxes all had to be returned to their very specific locations. The new shelving increases the storage space from 9,000 cubic feet to over 13,000 cubic feet — a total of 2.64 miles of shelves. Copyright 2024 KTUU. All rights reserved.",
