  "text": "While tying up your little brother on an electric chair may be fun for Wednesday Addams, other kids need something less dangerous (but just as spooky!) to play with instead. Hey, sometimes a new toy is the best way to distract your kids from torturing each other! If you are looking for a toy that’s “creepy and kooky” to play with this Halloween, then you have to check out The Addams Family new toy collaboration with Polly Pocket . It’s frightfully cute!\nMorticia, Gomez, Wednesday, and Pugsley Addams are all included in The Addams Family x Polly Pocket compact , designed in miniature like the ‘90s toys we all know and love. The details are picture-perfect. Morticia has sleek black hair and a form-fitting black dress, while Gomez wears a blue pinstripe suit, with his dark brown hair parted in the middle. Pugsley has on his classic red-and-white striped t-shirt, and Wednesday is in all black with two black braids hanging over her shoulders.\nTHE ADDAMS FAMILY, from left: Jimmy Workman, Christina Ricci, 1991. ph: Melinda Sue Gordon / © Paramount Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection © Paramount Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection Although not every family member is included in the set — Cousin It and Lurch, you are missed! — but the most important person (part of person?) is there: The Thing! The creepy cool expressive hand never moves far from the Addams family, so of course it needed to be in this collaboration as well. It can clip on to any of the family members while you play.\nThe bottom part of the compact features the outside grounds, complete with a tiny coffin Puglsey can nap in, gravestones, and a Piranha plant. The top half features the inside of the mysterious home, complete with a knight-in-shining-armor, a crystal ball, a piano, a candelabra, and a bookshelf filled with interesting items. And just like ever great haunted house, there are hidden secrets and moving parts everywhere!\nThe Addams Family x Polly Pocket/Amazon The Addams Family x Polly Pocket/Amazon Even the outside of the compact holds a spot of magic! The four family members sit in front, and if you twist the top they slowly transform into skeleton-looking characters.\nShop this creepy toy (and cool collector’s item!) below.\nPolly Pocket Collector Playset 'The Addams Family' Compact $30 Buy Now The world’s kookiest family is so cute in Polly Pocket form!\nCheck out these sweet & spooky Halloween books for the kids!",
