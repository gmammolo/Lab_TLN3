  "text": "[Rachel Bloom](https://playbill.com/person/rachel-bloom)'s solo show, Death, Let Me Do My Show, which she previously performed in two Off-Broadway runs, is coming to Netflix next month under the new title Death, Let Me Do My Special. [Per an earlier report in Variety](https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/rachel-bloom-netflix-special-death-let-me-do-my-show-1236064205/), the show was filmed at Williamstown Theater Festival July 12-13. Death, Let Me Do My Special will premiere on the streamer October 15. Bloom, best known as the writer and star of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, performed the show Off-Broadway at the Lucille Lortel Theatre in September 2023 and in an encore run at the Orpheum later the same year. The work has also played sold-out runs in London, Chicago, Boston, and more. According to ironic press notes from the Off-Broadway run, the one-woman musical comedy is \"NOT about the ever-present spectre of death ... [and] will in NO way explore the pandemic and all the tumultuous events that ensued in her personal life.\" [According to Playbill's interview](https://www.playbill.com/article/in-rachel-blooms-new-musical-she-sings-about-death) with Bloom, the show is about death and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. “I hope they think about the role death plays in their own lives,” Bloom says of what she hopes audiences take away from the show. “I hope that it makes them realize we shouldn't push down what happened in 2020. We shouldn’t forget.” Directed by [Seth Barrish](https://playbill.com/person/seth-barrish) (The Old Man & The Pool), the production featured scenic design by [Beowulf Boritt](https://playbill.com/person/beowulf-boritt-vault- 20789), lighting design by [Aaron Copp](https://playbill.com/person/aaron-copp-vault- 20572), projection design by Hana S. Kim, music direction by Jerome Kurtenbach, and costume design by [Kristin Isola](https://playbill.com/person/kristin-isola-vault-0000126968). [Mike Lavoie](https://playbill.com/person/mike-lavoie) and Carlee Briglia produced the Off-Broadway runs.",
