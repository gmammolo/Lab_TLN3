  "text": "CARLYLE - Michelle Cooper of Carlyle has always been a big supporter of her community. Recently she was awarded the Bowl of Hygeia, a prestigious award and the highest honour in the pharmacy profession. The Pharmacy Association of Saskatchewan held its conference Sept. 14-15 in Regina, and Cooper was presented with the honour. Cooper's connection to Carlyle runs deep. She and her husband Brad made their home in Carlyle where she was raised. Together they are raising two children, Jessica and Ryan, who attend school in Carlyle. The town has always been a strong anchor for Cooper, and she has continuously given back to the community that has shaped her for many years. Being a founding partner of Legacy Pharmacies, which operates seven pharmacies across Saskatchewan under the Pharmasave and Pharmachoice banners, she still finds time to be part of the community through volunteer work. Cooper is actively involved in several organizations, including the Carlyle Lions Club, the school community council, Carlyle Fun Dayz committee and the White Bear Cottagers Association. She has volunteered hundreds of hours to help keep organizations going, while being busy with her career. To be nominated for this award, one has to be a licensed pharmacist within the jurisdiction in which the award is presented, not have received this award before, and have an outstanding community service record apart from being a pharmacist. The Bowl of Hygeia was first presented in 1958 in the U.S. and came to Canada in 1961. It is now recognized in the 10 provinces, as each province holds its own awards. Nominations are usually done in secrecy. The word Hygeia is rooted from Greek mythology. It is said that Hygeia was the daughter of the god of health, and she tended to the temples and people of her time. Her cup has come to represent medicine and her snake to represent healing. This award is one of the longest-standing, continuously-presented pharmacy honours in Canada.",
