  "text": "Bridgerton season 4 is truly a lesson in good things come to those who wait. Following the end of season 3 (AKA after waiting for months), we were over the moon to find out Luke Thompson's Benedict would lead the senior season, even if we originally thought Luke Newton spoiled it would actually be about Eloise . And after literal years of waiting to see who would play Ben's love interest Sophie, including a major theory Cressida had actually been Sophie the whole time , we were introduced to Yerin Ha as Sophie Baek .\nThe Halo actress told Tudum how much she's enjoyed joining the Bridgerton cast family, and how much she's enjoyed her dance lessons so far . It looks like the dance lessons are paying off because we just got the first leak from the Bridgerton season 4 set and it's proof that Yerin and Luke are the perfect match.\nCheck Out The First 'Bridgerton' Season 4 Leak!\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Bridgerton (@thebridgertonfamily)\nThe first thing I thought of when I saw these Bridgerton season 4 leaks was just how perfect the height difference between Luke Thompson and Yerin Ha is. I can't wait to see them dance!!!\nPlus, I just cannot get over Sophie's dress. We know from the books that her masquerade ball persona becomes The Lady In Silver, and the bows and beaded detail are a gorgeous addition to an outfit book fans have been waiting so long for. While less feminine or over-the-top, I'm also digging Ben's vest and trousers. Last year we got pirate Colin, maybe now we get pirate Benedict?\nWe knew that Bridgerton season 4 would capture the magic of Cinderella , but these leaks prove the Netflix series is dedicated to shaking things up. Instead of Sophie running away and making her way down the stairs solo, she's actually joined by Benedict for an outdoor dance, which is totally giving A Cinderella Story . Private moments are few and far between in the Ton, so here's hoping Benedict and Sophie get to steal quite a few.\nRead up on This Bridgerton Season 4 Detail Is The Perfect Catalyst For Eloise's Love Story for more!\nFrom Your Site Articles Attention, Anthony Lovers!
