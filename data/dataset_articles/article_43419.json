  "text": "ASSINIBOIA — Harvest is nearly complete in southwest Saskatchewan as 95 per cent of crops have been taken off, which continues to lead the province in harvest progress.\nProducers are significantly ahead of the five-year average of 77 per cent and the 10-year average of 73 per cent for harvest progress.\nAll fall-cereal, oat, triticale, soybean and field pea crops have been harvested. Ninety-nine per cent of lentil crops and 91 per cent of chickpeas have been harvested. Harvest is nearly complete for the remaining spring-seeded cereals as 98 per cent of barley, 97 per cent of spring wheat and durum and 87 per cent of canary seed is off. Lastly, most oilseed crops have been combined with 97 per cent of mustard, 94 per cent of canola, and 74 per cent of flax in the bin.\nSome areas in the southwest received rain during this reporting period. The most rainfall seen in the southwest was around Richmound, which got 26 mm of precipitation, followed by areas around Dollard and Leader that received 15 mm.\nThe rain did not significantly impact topsoil moisture and conditions remain dry in the southwest. Cropland topsoil moisture is rated nine per cent adequate, 31 per cent short and 60 per cent very short. Hayland topsoil moisture is four per cent adequate, 33 per cent short and 63 per cent very short. Pasture topsoil moisture is also dry as four per cent is adequate, 39 per cent is short and 57 per cent is very short.\nThe poorest pasture conditions in the province are found in the southwest as a mere five per cent are in good condition, 40 per cent are fair, 30 per cent are poor and 25 per cent are in very poor condition.\nThe main sources of crop damage this past week were from dry conditions, wind and grasshopper activity. Now that harvest is largely wrapping up, producers are hoping for lots of rain this fall to improve soil moisture and mitigate some of the negative effects of the dry conditions.\nFor more information about Southwestern Saskatchewan, explore the\nCrop Report Dashboard.\n|\n|\nSouthwest Saskatchewan\n|\n|\nCensus Division\n|\n|\nPer cent Harvested\n|\n|\n3\n|\n|\n95\n|\n|\n4\n|\n|\n94\n|\n|\n7\n|\n|\n92\n|\n|\n8\n|\n|\n98\n|\n|\nRegion Average\n|\n|\n95",
