  "text": "Congratulations are in order for Charlie Puth, who just tied the knot with his now wife, Brooke Sansone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nView this post on Instagram\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA post shared by Charlie Puth (@charlieputh)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe couple celebrated their nuptials at the groom’s family home in Montecito, California, on September 7. “Thank you for making me the happiest man alive. It has always been you,” Puth wrote in an Instagram post alongside a slideshow of photos from their special day.\\nThe lovebirds – who both grew up in New Jersey – have been engaged since September 2023.\\n\\nHere’s what we know about Charlie Puth’s new wifey:\\nWho are Brooke Sansone’s parents?\\n\\nBrooke Sansone, who also goes by the nickname Brookie, was born to her parents, Paul Sansone Jr and Chris Sansone. According to The Statesman, her father is an auto dealer and has been married to his wife for over 33 years.\\nPuth, 32, has said that their families have been intertwined for years. “I mean, she grew up one town over from me in New Jersey, and my parents know her parents,” he told People magazine. “Her dad has been best friends with my dad since the third grade, so it’s kind of like I’m just gaining another family right away, even before the wedding. And they’ve also known me before the fame, before everything, so I can’t think of a better situation, quite frankly.”\\nWhere did Brooke Sansone go to university?\\n\\nThe 25-year-old is a marketing graduate. According to her LinkedIn profile, she obtained a bachelor of science in marketing, in 2021.\\n\\nBefore that, she studied at Red Bank Catholic High School, where she was the president of the “hot topics club” and played girl’s lacrosse.\\nWhat does Brooke Sansone do for work?\\n\\nWhile her partner is a multimillionaire singer, Sansone has a totally different career path.\\n\\nPer her LinkedIn page, she is currently a digital marketing and PR coordinator at Butter and Eggs Interiors in New York. She’s also worked at companies like Hyer Home in Charleston and was an influencer for RewardStyle.\\nHow did Brooke Sansone meet Charlie Puth?\\n\\nPuth and Sansone go way back. During an interview on SiriusXM’s The Howard Stern Show, the “We Don’t Talk Anymore” musician said that they grew up together as friends. “ [She’s] someone that I grew up with,” he said. “As my life gets more turbulent and I travel everywhere, it’s really nice to have someone close to you that you’ve known for a very long time … and I would assume that when times inevitably are hard in the future – because what is life without valleys and peaks – she would be there for me as well.”\\nIt seems like Sansone also helps to keep Puth grounded. “Honestly, I get so scared of people now, like, I can’t really walk anywhere for whatever reason, and I think the more that happens, the more I just want to retreat to someone that I’ve known for a long time. I’m not really interested in going out like I used to and being crazy,” he added.\\nWhen did Brooke Sansone and Charlie Puth get engaged?\\n\\nThe pair reportedly started dating at some point in 2022. The “One Call Away” singer announced their engagement in an Instagram post he shared in September 2023.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nView this post on Instagram\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA post shared by Charlie Puth (@charlieputh)\\n\\n\\n\\n“I flew to New York to ask my best friend to marry me, and she said yes. I am the happiest, best version of myself and it is all because of you Brookie. I love you endlessly forever and ever and ever,” he wrote.\\nWho else has Charlie Puth dated?\\n\\nBefore finding his happily ever after with Sansone, Puth was romantically linked to a number of celebs including singer Charlotte Lawrence, Prodigal Son actress Halston Sage, Disney star Danielle Campbell, model Bella Thorne, and Rare Beauty founder Selena Gomez, per Cosmopolitan.\\n",
