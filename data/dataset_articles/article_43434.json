  "text": "By CBS Sports Staff ,\n2 hours ago USATSI The largest NFL favorites the first two weeks of the 2024 NFL season lost outright, another example of parity across the NFL. The Bengals (-7.5) are the largest favorites on the Week 3 NFL schedule, according to the latest Week 3 NFL odds from the SportsLine Consensus, against the Washington Commanders. How should you feel about playing the Bengals with a high spread in Week 3 NFL betting picks and NFL parlay picks? Elsewhere, the San Francisco 49ers are 7-point favorites against the Los Angeles Rams in the latest Week 3 NFL betting spreads, the only other game with a touchdown spread or higher on the Week 3 NFL Vegas odds.\nEleven of 16 games were decided by seven points or fewer last week, so how should that factor into making Week 3 NFL predictions? Before you make any Week 3 NFL picks, you need to see the NFL against the spread, over-under, and money line predictions powered by SportsLine AI .\nBuilt using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each game. The AI predictions are determined by statistically learning from each team's historical data and then quantitatively evaluating the strength of the opponent's defense by assigning a numeric value out of 100 called a matchup score.\nOnce a prediction is formulated, the AI rating is generated using the prediction, the matchup score, and the odds of the market. For example, you could see an A-rating on an over bet if a team is facing a poor defense, their prediction differs from the line and there are favorable odds.\nIn addition, SportsLine AI is the first fully automated predictive model at SportsLine. It continuously refreshes on the most recent available data and can help you spot the biggest discrepancies in the lines. Last season, SportsLine's AI PickBot hit a whopping 1,674 4.5- and 5-star prop picks. Anyone who has followed it is way up.\nFor Week 3, the AI PickBot has evaluated the NFL odds and provided NFL betting predictions for all 16 games. You can only see the AI predictions for the Week 3 NFL schedule here .\nTop Week 3 NFL AI picks After analyzing every game in Week 3, the AI PickBot says the Rams cover as seven-point home underdogs against the 49ers . The Rams are dealing with some devastating injuries at the moment, especially on offense. Cooper Kupp (ankle) and Puka Nacua (knee) are both out and the Rams offensive line is dealing with injuries as well. But Stafford has dealt with leading an offense without Kupp due to injuries in previous seasons as the 36-year-old quarterback can read a defense and spread the ball around to the open player even without an elite receiver on the field. The Rams averaged 24.5 points per game in their first four games of the season last year without Kupp.\nThe 49ers aren't entering at full strength either with Christian McCaffrey (calf/Achilles) and Deebo Samuel (calf) out. Brock Purdy hasn't been the same MVP-caliber QB this season without some of his top playmakers as he's averaging 11.7 yards per completion, the fewest of his three-year career. Purdy had two turnovers (one fumble, one interception) as the 49ers lost 23-17 to the Vikings last week and AI PickBot expects the Rams to hang with San Francisco on Sunday. See its other Week 3 football predictions and football picks at SportsLine .\nHow to make Week 3 NFL picks In addition, the AI PickBot has generated five other A-rated picks for Week 3. You need to see the AI PickBot's picks before making any Week 3 NFL bets of your own. You can only see them at SportsLine .\nWho wins and covers each Week 3 NFL game, and which A-rated picks should you target? Visit SportsLine now to see the top NFL picks against the spread, over-under, and on money line, all from the brand-new SportsLine AI PickBot that nailed 1,674 top-rated picks last season .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
