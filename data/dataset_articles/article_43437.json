The incredibly rare car in a ‘Tungsten Grey’ finish with silver racing stripes and an ebony leather interior still had its original delivery tags, stickers, and plastic covers. One of 541 in the shade produced that year, it’s powered by a 5.4-liter DOHC V8 engine and packs 550HP. It’s currently en route to the lucky buyer in Texas from a private collection in Canada – and with just a 5 percent buyer fee, it sold for a fraction of what traditional auction houses would charge at $450,000. Produced only during the period 2005-2006, the Ford GT was Ford’s tribute to the GT40 race cars that dominated at Le Mans from 1966-1969. Its aluminum body and chassis honored the original design with a few modern upgrades. Later 2005 models featured improved suspension and an easier hood release, with these changes carried into 2006. Its retro-inspired interior and unique cut-out doors set it apart. Priced at $139,995 when launched, the Ford GT became a modern icon, rivaling much pricier European supercars.
