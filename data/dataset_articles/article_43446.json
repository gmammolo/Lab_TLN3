  "text": "Hamzah Sheeraz appears destined to go right to the top, and his plan to match Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury's stardom is clear. The rising middleweight star is undefeated, earning huge plaudits on UK shores and already growing into a major player in the sport under promoter Frank Warren . Sheeraz has fought on some huge occasions in his career so far, including the Queensberry vs Matchroom 5 vs 5 in June, and is starting to generate the hype of a superstar in the making. He will next take on a domestic clash against Tyler Denny under the bright lights in front of 96,000 people at Wembley Stadium on the Anthony Joshua vs Daniel Dubois undercard . And the 25-year-old carries an aura of supreme confidence that he can become a leading figurehead of British boxing alongside heavyweights Joshua and Fury. Read More In Boxing \"I definitely want to be the face of British boxing with AJ and Fury,\" he told talkSPORT.com. \"I'd be a fool to think otherwise. You can only dream big and everything I have dreamed of is becoming reality. \"I have already started fulfilling dreams by continuing to work hard and show dedication, so I need to keep that up. \"And like I said with my team, if I listen to them and I'm sure within the next two years or so I can be up there.\" Most read in Boxing Joshua and Fury have become the most prominent figures in a bright age for domestic boxing talent, both selling out Wembley Stadium for huge fights. The pair are both at the peak of their powers and are firmly in the world title mix alongside Oleksandr Usyk . Sheeraz has high hopes of reaching world level in the imminent future, which will help him grow his name further in line with his mercurial talent. His promoter Warren has heavily backed him to reach the pinnacle of the sweet science, and Sheeraz has also linked up with Saudi boxing chief HE Turki Alalshikh as a Riyadh Season Ambassador to lead the revolution. Some huge fights are being made domestically on UK shores across the globe, with a host of big names campaigning including Chris Eubank Jr. Sheeraz is also 6ft 3ins, a towering operator, who will easily be capable of switching to heavier divisions for success including 168lbs where Canelo Alvarez has dominated for so long. The British talent has spoken fondly of fighting at a time when opportunities are becoming bigger and better for boxers to reach new heights. He continued: \"It's the best time to be in boxing. \"Having the Saudis involved, they have brought boxing back to how it used to be in the 80's. \"The best are fighting the best and them fighting four or five times a year. When someone comes along and changes the game like that, you can only be thankful. \"I suppose the only way I can thank these guys is by carrying on putting on these devastating performances at every opportunity I get.\" For now focus will switch for Sheeraz to making another statement against Denny. A win for Sheeraz, straight after dispatching of prospect Ammo Williams in such dominant fashion, could see the star awarded a world title shot. And he believes it won't be long until he knocks on the door too heavily for other contenders and champions to ignore. He concluded: \"This fight against Denny is giving me a buzz but any fight does at this stage. \"I prepare for him like I would any opponent, but I look at it as any day in the office as I progress forwad. Read More on talkSPORT \"But this one feels massively important for me given the amount of people, but I need to carry on winning. \"But god willing I will become one of the biggest names in boxing, I just need to take one step at a time, beat Denny and keep listening to those advising me.\" talkSPORT will bring you exclusive live commentary of the heavyweight clash at Wembley Stadium between Anthony Joshua and Daniel Dubois on Saturday, September 21.
