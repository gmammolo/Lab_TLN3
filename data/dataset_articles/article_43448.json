  "text": "Local News For SoCal wildfire victims, state blocks insurance companies from dropping coverage for a year By Marissa Wenzke\nSeptember 19, 2024 / 12:02 PM PDT / KCAL News\nCBS News Live CBS News Los Angeles Live For 750,000 people affected by Southern California wildfires, the state has blocked insurance companies from dropping or refusing to renew their coverage — issuing a one-year moratorium to stop this from happening across four counties.\nInsurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara announced the mandatory year-long freeze Thursday, and it's intended to preserve home home insurance coverage for thousands of residents who faced wildfires earlier this month across Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange and Riverside counties. Altogether, the Airport , Bridge and Line fires burned through over 100,000 acres, or more than 150 square miles, in less than a week as thousands fled their homes, several people were injured and dozens of homes were lost .\nGov. Gavin Newsom declared states of emergencies, with with FEMA assistance secured and the National Guard deployed.\nThe one-year moratorium shields people who live \"within the perimeters or adjoining ZIP Codes\" of where the fires burned from insurance non-renewal or cancellation for one year from the date of the governor's emergency declarations — regardless of whether they sustained a loss.\nHe first declared a state of emergency on Sept. 7 for the Line Fire in San Bernardino County. Then, on Sept. 11, he declared states of emergency in LA and San Bernardino counties for the Bridge Fire and in Orange and Riverside counties for the Airport Fire.\n\"By law, I am able to place moratoriums on insurance company homeowners cancellations and non-renewals in areas stricken by wildfires,\" Insurance Commissioner Lara said in a statement Thursday, describing the moratorium as a \"temporary protection.\"\n\"This creates much-needed breathing room for homeowners while my Sustainable Insurance Strategy takes effect, Lara said. \"Wildfire survivors should not have to worry about insurance while they are recovering.\"\nCalifornia's Department of Insurance is sending staff members to wildfire disaster areas help with filing claims and give guidance on avoiding insurance fraud and abuse. They can be found at local assistance centers currently open across four SoCal counties.\nMore information for homeowners affected can be found by visiting here or by calling 800-927-4357 with any insurance-related question. A full guide to resources and information for wildfire recovery can be found here .\nBelow is a full list of assistance centers currently open in Southern Californian where those affected by recent wildfires can get help with home insurance claims and related information.\nLos Angeles County - Bridge Fire LA County Fairplex – Expo Hall 8 (Enter Gate 3)\n1101 W.
