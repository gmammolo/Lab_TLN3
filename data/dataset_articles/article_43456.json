  "text": "Former President Donald Trump’s third post-presidency book, [Save America](https://45books.com/collections/books-by-president-trump/products/save-america?variant=45465486033108), debuts on the New York Times [bestseller list](https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2024/09/22/hardcover-nonfiction/) this weekend, a shocker of sorts because of the newspaper’s effort to ignore the book, as well as the book’s $99 price tag. While it is just the latest [bestseller list](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/3134746/trump-new-book-save-america-surges-no-1/) to feature the [360-page large format book](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/3099342/new-trump-book-offers-peek-into-next-presidency/), it is clearly the most important for the New York real estate developer. “I just learned that my newest book, SAVE AMERICA, is a New York Times BEST SELLER! No other book takes you behind the scenes like this coffee table book. I picked each photo, and I can tell you it is FANTASTIC. Get your copy today at 45books.com,” he wrote on Truth Social. For the New York Times Sept. 22 list of hardcover nonfiction books, Trump’s opens at No. 11. Save America is similar to his two other post-presidency books that feature photos accompanied by his commentary. The first, [Our Journey Together](https://45books.com/collections/books/products/copy-of-our-journey-together-2023?variant=43455258984660), featured photos of his administration with comments on several. His second, [Letters to Trump](https://45books.com/collections/books/products/letters-to-trump?variant=43651757441236), was a collection of notes from celebrities, sports figures, and world politicians and his thoughts on each. His newest features key moments in his first administration to help lay out the foundation of his plans should he beat Vice President Kamala Harris in November, making the 45th president the 47th president. The cover is the iconic photo of Trump with his fist in the air, yelling, “Fight, fight, fight” after an assassin’s bullet clipped his right ear in July. “We are thrilled President Trump has made multiple bestseller lists, including the New York Times. Considering that his book is worth much more than any other book on the list, it’s an incredible accomplishment,” said Sergio Gor, CEO of [Winning Team Publishing](https://45books.com/), which he and Donald Trump Jr. created. [SEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets) Its placement as No. 11 is surprising, considering that Save America is by far the most expensive book on all the New York Times lists, at $99. What’s more, the New York Times list does not include those sold through Trump’s publisher, with which the vast majority were preordered. Had the New York Times included all the direct sales, it is likely the book would have been the nation’s No. 1 bestseller, according to industry sources.",
