  "text": "Lucknow: Terming cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) a key life skill, head of cardiology department at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Prof Aditya Kapoor, underscored need to spread awareness on sudden cardiac arrest and how CPR could save lives.CPR is a simple life-saving skill which can be learned easily, thereby giving the patient the few crucial extra minutes before medical help arrives.He was speaking at a CPR awareness workshop organised at the department of planning and programme implementation here on Thursday to benefit employees and staff.\\\"Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) kills around 7 lakh people annually in India and it can happen to anyone, anytime and anywhere. About 95% victims do not survive due to minimal public awareness and knowledge on how to handle such emergencies,\\\" said Prof Kapoor.Adding that a delay of a single minute could decrease chances of survival by 10%, he added that if the public was made aware of how to perform CPR, they could help save lives.Principal secretary Alok Kumar told reporters that hands-on training included key tips on how to recognise sudden cardiac arrest besides the technique of CPR. \\\"The expert spoke about using lifesaving device called automated external defibrillator (AED), besides taking questions on cardiac health,\\\" said Kumar.",
