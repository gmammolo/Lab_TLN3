Having toured Canada together earlier this year to incredible acclaim, City and Colour and Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats are ready to deliver their extraordinary live show to audiences down under. TUESDAY 14 JANUARY- Riverstage | Brisbane QLD (Lic. All Ages) THURSDAY 16 JANUARY- Hordern Pavilion | Sydney NSW (Lic. All Ages) SATURDAY 18 JANUARY- Sidney Myer Music Bowl | Melbourne VIC (Lic. All Ages) MONDAY 20 JANUARY- Adelaide Entertainment Centre Theatre | Adelaide SA (Lic. All Ages) THURSDAY 23 JANUARY- Red Hill Auditorium | Perth WA (Lic. 13+) On his last nationwide tour of Australia in 2023, City and Colour played intimate venues that sold out immediately, along with a string of appearances at SummerSalt Festival, stunning audiences with his trademark vocals, raw honesty and dialogue, talents that have endeared him to music lovers around the world since City and Colour’s inception in 2005. 2025 will mark Green’s nineteenth tour of Australia, having previously visited ten times as City and Colour, and another eight times with the band Alexisonfire. City and Colour released his critically praised seventh studio album The Love Still Held Me Near last year. Over the course of seven studio albums, City and Colour has compiled a canon ripe with songs born of adoration and devotion, amassing a legion of dedicated fans worldwide and garnering him three JUNOs, including two Songwriter of the Year awards, plus multiple triple, double, platinum and gold certifications in his native Canada. One of the most recognisable forces in contemporary rock ‘n roll, eight-piece Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats are an undeniable live act, most recently in Australia in 2023. Since 2015, Rateliff has led his denim-clad, horn-flanked Night Sweats to stages across the globe, leaving awed audiences in their wake. Their combustible mix of soul and rock quickly cemented them as a rare generational band who balances ecstatic live shows with engrossing and rich records. South Of Here, the fourth Night Sweats album reckons with a lifetime of pain and trauma and transforms it into a stirring and soul-baring rumination on love, loss, hope and resolve. Following And It’s Still Alright, Rateliff’s beloved 2020 solo LP, and The Future, The Night Sweat’s acclaimed 2021 release, the new album blends both sides of his immense talent: emotionally potent, vivid storytelling and the rugged, R&B revivalism that has powered the band to world-wide acclaim over the past decade. Unrivalled talents, don’t miss City and Colour with Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats when they tour Australia together for the very first time in January.
