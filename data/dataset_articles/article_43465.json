  "text": "Introducing 199X, born Marquis Jackson on September 27, 1996, an emerging force in American music whose path reflects unwavering resilience and commitment. Originating from Wichita, Kansas, 199X’s early life was steeped in the realities of street culture and a passion for sports. However, a pivotal move to Atlanta, Georgia, expanded his musical horizons.\nTragedy struck with the untimely passing of his two younger cousins in a drive-by shooting, a devastating event that propelled 199X to pour his emotions into rap more earnestly. Seeking new opportunities after high school, he relocated to Orlando, Florida. There, he became an integral part of the local music community, connecting with notable artists such as Tyla Yaweh, XXXTENTACION, and WifisFuneral.These experiences were instrumental in refining his songwriting and production skills.\nAt 19, 199X ventured to Los Angeles, a move marked by significant hardship, including a period of homelessness. This challenging time led him to shift his focus behind the scenes, working as a producer and songwriter with established artists. In LA, he honed his craft under the mentorship of industry heavyweights like Ronny J (OMG RONNY) and the GRAMMY-nominated duo “TheHitList.” Selling beats and crafting hooks, he steadily built a reputation within the competitive music industry.\nDespite his accomplishments behind the scenes, 199X felt a persistent pull back to performing. His ties to street life momentarily sidetracked his artistic pursuits, creating a tension between his past and his ambitions. A turning point came when That Mexican OT discovered his talent, offering him a spot as an opening act on an upcoming 2024 tour. This opportunity marked a significant leap forward, allowing him to present his music to a wider audience.\n199X’s debut single, “ STNDBY ,” has already made a significant impact, soaring to #1 on the iTunes Hip Hop/Rap charts. This achievement underscores his potential to leave a lasting mark on the music scene. Anticipation is building for his forthcoming project, “I NEVER FORGOT WHAT YOU TOLD ME,” which promises to delve deeper into his personal journey and artistic vision.\nFrom the streets of Wichita to the spotlight of Los Angeles, 199X’s story is one of perseverance, creativity, and the relentless pursuit of his dreams . His music not only entertains but also tells a powerful narrative of overcoming adversity. As he continues to rise, 199X embodies the spirit of an artist who has transformed personal trials into a compelling and inspirational musical journey.",
