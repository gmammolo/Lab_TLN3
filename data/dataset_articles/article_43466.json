  "text": "Texas Longhorns coach Steve Sarkisian has announced Arch Manning will start at quarterback against UL Monroe at DKR on Saturday night. Sark says Ewers continues to improve and will rest this week.\nManning replaced Quinn Ewers after a 2nd quarter oblique injury against UTSA and accounted for five touchdowns, which included a 67-yard touchdown run and a 75-yard TD pass to WR Ryan Wingo. This was the first time in Longhorns history a player recorded a run and throw of at least 65 yards in the same game. Only Colt McCoy and Vince Young had done it in the same season for Texas, according to ESPN .\n“Arch is more than capable, as I think we all know. I mean, you go out and you have five touchdowns coming in off the bench, you’ve already proved you can play. Now, it’s about executing the plan, doing it with confidence and fixing some of the issues on the field when they arise.” — Steve Sarkisian\nLet’s ride 🤘 @ArchManning pic.twitter.com/MzmCBnYi75\n— Texas Football (@TexasFootball) September 19, 2024\nSark says Ewers will continue treatment for his strained oblique and will be on the sideline supporting Manning and the rest of the team.\n“Quinn has made great strides ever since Saturday night into where he’s gotten to. But my decision is I’m looking forward to his future as a player, but also the future of the season for us. … And getting him possibly one more week healthier for the long term, I think, is good for us as we’re getting ready for SEC play. Quinn will obviously have an earpiece in. He’ll hear every play call. Without question, his support of Arch is critical, and I don’t foresee anything different than that.” — Steve Sarkisian\nIt sounds like the plan is for Ewers to only miss this weekend’s game. The Texas coach has told Ewers that a week off doesn’t change anything as far as who the Longhorns permanent starting quarterback will be.\n“All the goals [Ewers] had and that we’ve had for him coming into this season are all still there for him. I think we have a national championship-caliber team, and he’s the quarterback of that team. And I think we still have that in front of us to go do that. … This guy’s going to be in New York for the Heisman … and I think he has the ability to be a top-five NFL draft pick.” — Steve Sarkisian.\nSarkisian says it will be different for Manning operating the game plan from the opening series rather than just being thrown into the game.",
