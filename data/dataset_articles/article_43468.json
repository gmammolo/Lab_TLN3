  "text": "Chicago’s Seraphina returns with a heavy-hitting “…comeback from heartbreak…” type of joint entitled “ Life After Love “. From the opening background scream of frustration to the heavy metal guitar-led musicbed the young dynamo gets after it in a superior fashion. The single is accompanied by a cinematic music video that harkens back to a different era but the message is clear…love lost is not a new thing, why haven’t humans evolved beyond centuries-old pain.\nThe main question of the song is, “Will anger consume you within your love life…how will you cope”…Seraphina certainly gives us some clear thoughts on the matter.\nOur continuing coverage of this dynamic young lioness has foretold of a movement led by Seraphina that’s crossing both generational and international boundaries. Her pull on listeners appears to be her “Old Soul” perspectives as she crafts music some may say should be well beyond her years. Needless to say, we’re not surprised at this wave.\nSerphina’s arrival isn’t by happenstance , it’s been crafted! Starting at the prestigious Chicago Academy for the Arts, where she honed her skills in acting, dance, and vocal performance. This rigorous training has shaped her into a dynamic performer, with her talents extending into modeling engagements as well. At just a teenager, she has already made a significant impact in 2024 including getting a synch placement with EA Sports alongside iconic Chicago collaborator Twista when their song “Nothing” got picked up for the new Madden game AND, her video “You’re The One To Blame”, got selected for rotation on MTV’s “Brand Spanking New” show, airing in the US, Latin America, and Mexico.\nWe’ve said it before but it bears repeating , “Seraphina’s journey from the underground music scene of Chicago to global recognition is a testament to her talent and hard work. As she continues to break barriers and set new benchmarks, the industry watches closely. With her current trajectory, Seraphina is poised to become a major player in the music world, bringing fresh energy and a unique sound that resonates across demographics. Keep an eye on this rising star; she’s just getting started. Join the conversation on TikTok @seraphina.sanan ”",
