  "text": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton (D-North Shore/South Brooklyn) worked with other elected officials to get the JCC’s new Early Childhood Center open after the center faced yet another potential delay. “As a parent of two young children, I understand firsthand how crucial access to childcare is,” said Scarcella-Spanton. “It was important to me that we resolved the issue as soon as possible. The JCC’s Early Childhood Center is an essential resource for local families, and I am proud to have worked in ensuring it opens as soon as possible.” The center —which can be found at Temple Israel — was initially supposed to open on the first day of school. A halt of the center’s opening came from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, according to a written statement, “leaving 70 North Shore families scrambling for alternate plans.” When alerted about the issue, the senator and Councilwoman Kamillah Hanks (D-North Shore) worked with the necessary city departments and agencies to get the center up and running before another two-week delay, including the Department of Health, the FDNY, and the Office of Children and Family Services. “This success highlights the power of collaboration between city and state officials. By working closely with the FDNY and the NYC Department of Health, my office was able to fast-track the approvals needed to ensure the JCC’s Early Childhood Center could open in a timely manner. It took coordinated efforts across multiple agencies to overcome the hurdles that could have delayed the opening by weeks. The teamwork between my office, and local elected officials made it possible for us to cut through the red tape, expedite background checks, and secure the necessary approvals, all within a tight timeframe. This was truly a team effort, and I’m proud of what we accomplished together for the families in our community,” Kamillah Hanks said. JCC CEO Orit Lender said, “I am incredibly grateful for the support of our local elected officials who worked hard behind the scenes to make this happen. We received support from the governor and mayor’s offices, Senator Scarcella-Spanton, Assembly Member Pirozzolo, Borough President Fossella, and Council Member Hanks in pushing the city and state to allow us to open. Our partner organization UJA-Federation of NY was also a huge help in moving the process along. Without all of their support, we would not have been able to open this week. It was incredible to see the smiling faces of the children and parents as they entered their new school for the first time.”",
