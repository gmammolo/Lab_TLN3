Feel free to get creative with this sugar cookie base, and add orange extract, or lemon extract to make some new cookie flavors that are just as delicious.

How To Store Storage – Store these cookies in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days.\nFreezing – You can also freeze the cookies for up to three months. I like to wrap them individually in plastic wrap and then store them in a freezer bag. Thaw in the fridge overnight or on the counter for 30 minutes before enjoying.\nSandra’s Pro Tips ​The bottom of a drink glass can help you get the cookies flattened to the size that you need. Be careful not to overbake these cookies as overbaking will change the texture of the cookies. You don’t want these cookies to be golden brown when you remove them from the oven. Once you add the dry ingredients to the cookie dough, don’t overmix. Mix until just combined. You want the frosting to be a spreadable consistency but not overly thick.

Then, line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium mixing bowl combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and cream of tarter. Set aside. With an electric mixer cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and 3 tablespoons of powdered sugar until fluffy, then mix in the oil. Add the egg and vanilla to the butter mixture and beat until combined. Slowly add the dry mixture, and mix until just combined. Form the dough into 2 1/2″ balls or 130 g each. Flatten the dough ball into a 4-5″ cookie. Place the cookies on the baking sheet at least 2 inch apart. Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 9-12 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on a wire rack. For the frosting, cream together the butter and powdered sugar until smooth. Slowly add the milk and vanilla until you reach your desired consistency. Add a few drops of pink food coloring. Frost the cooled cookies and store them in the fridge until ready to serve. Notes If you want perfectly sized cookies, I highly recommend that you use the scale method to measure your cookie dough balls. Don’t worry if your cookies are misshapen when they come out of the oven. While they are still warm, gently place a glass upside down over the cookie, and gently roll the cookie inside of the glass. This will give you the perfect round cookie. It’s important to use completely room temperature butter to get a smooth cookie dough and a smooth frosting. For a natural pink color in the frosting you can add beet juice, raspberry puree or strawberry puree in place of pink food coloring.
