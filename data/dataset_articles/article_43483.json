Broadnax says Garcia will take on his new position beginning November 4.\nThe memo says Garcia will oversee the public safety portfolio, which includes the Austin Fire Department, Austin Police Department, Austin/Travis County Emergency Medical Services.\nGarcia is reportedly retiring from law enforcement to take over the role.\nChief Garcia was looked at for the chief roles in Austin and Houston earlier this year.\nIn May, the chief announced that he had reached an agreement with the city that would keep him in Dallas into 2027.\nThe agreement included a retention bonus for Garcia. Starting in November 2024, he would get a $10,000 bonus every six months. The agreement also included a year&apos;s severance pay if he was terminated before 2027.\nThe severance pay would not be included if he voluntarily resigns.\nGarcia also agreed to help the city with the selection of a new police chief before he left.\nThe chief is not under contract because of the city&apos;s charter.\nSince Garcia arrived in Dallas in 2021, city leaders have credited him with reducing crime and improving morale.\nGarcia sent a memo to Dallas Police Department employees about his resignation:\nDallas Mayor Eric Johnson and interim Dallas City Manager Kimberly Tolbert released a joint statement on Garcia&apos;s resignation:\nThe Source Information from City of Austin memo and FOX 4 Dallas.",
