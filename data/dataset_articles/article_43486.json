It allows us to share our story and our beer with even more of our Wisconsin family,” said co-owner and founder Ben Johnson.\n“We’re proud to be rooted in Elkhorn, and we’re excited to have Milwaukeeans experience a piece of our farm life through every pour.”\nThese are the Duesterbeck's brews (with descriptions from Johnson) that will be distributed in Milwaukee:\n- Barn Quilt Blondie: A light and refreshing blonde ale that celebrates the colorful barn quilts of Wisconsin’s farmlands. Crisp and approachable, this brew is perfect for any occasion.\n- Dairy Air Hazy IPA: Bold yet balanced, Dairy Air Hazy IPA delivers a juicy hop flavor with notes of citrus and tropical fruits. Named for our dairy farm roots, this hazy IPA is a crowd favorite for those who enjoy a more adventurous flavor profile.\n- Pig Farmer Pale Ale: Inspired by our farming background, Pig Farmer Pale Ale offers a balanced malt body with just the right amount of hop bitterness, delivering a smooth and easy-drinking experience.\n- Roosterbeck Amber Ale: This rich and malty amber ale packs a slightly sweet caramel flavor with a subtle hop finish. Roosterbeck Amber Ale pays homage to the early risers and hardworking farmers that inspire us.\n- Nutty Bill’s Peanut Butter Porter: Creamy, smooth, and packed with real peanut butter flavor, Nutty Bill’s Porter is a decadent dessert beer that satisfies with every sip.\nFor more information on Duesterbeck’s and a beer finder, go to\ndbcbrewery.com.\nBorn in Brooklyn, N.Y., where he lived until he was 17, Bobby received his BA-Mass Communications from UWM in 1989 and has lived in Walker's Point, Bay View, Enderis Park, South Milwaukee and on the East Side.\nHe has published three non-fiction books in Italy – including one about an event in Milwaukee history, which was published in the U.S. in autumn 2010.
