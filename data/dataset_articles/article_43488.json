  "text": "How To Celebrate The Fall Equinox For Sweet Seasonal Transition\nWhen the days grow shorter and the air turns crisp, I find myself eagerly anticipating the arrival of the fall equinox. Living in Brooklyn, New York, a place where the city’s energy never seems to slow, it might seem odd to seek out the subtle seasonal transitions. But, for me, special days like the\nequinox and solstice are major touchstones for grounding my spirit and nourishing my creativity.\nThis means I eagerly anticipate the autumnal shift. Every year, as the fall equinox approaches, I find myself leaning into the quieter, more reflective rhythms that this time of year invites.\n“This day is a celebration — a time to honor the harvest and all that we’ve gathered, both literally and metaphorically.”\nAnd, it’s a good time to exist in the liminal space between light and dark, work and rest. An observance, if you will. Essentially, this day is a celebration — a time to honor the harvest and all that we’ve gathered, both literally and metaphorically.\nAs you keep scrolling, I’ll share not only the science behind this special day but also the rich tapestry of cultural celebrations that have honored the equinox throughout history. If you’re like me and looking for meaningful ways to celebrate, I’ve gathered a few ideas (from experienced experts and practitioners!) that can help you welcome the season with intention and grace. 🍂\nSo, what is the fall equinox? Let’s dive right in.\nOccurring usually on September 22nd or 23rd, the fall equinox marks a pivotal moment in our yearly journey around the sun. (This year, in 2024, we’ll be celebrating on Sunday, September 22nd.) This day is significant because it represents a perfect balance between daylight and darkness. Astronomically speaking, the equinox happens when the sun crosses the celestial equator, moving from north to south. As a result, day and night are almost equal in length everywhere on Earth. This balance is a direct consequence of Earth’s tilted axis, which is inclined at approximately 23.5° relative to its orbit around the sun. (Pretty cool, huh?)\n“This day is significant because it represents a perfect balance between daylight and darkness.”\nFYI: The word equinox itself comes from Latin, meaning “equal night.” On this day, the sun’s rays strike the equator perpendicularly, creating this equal distribution of daylight and darkness. Then, the nights gradually grow longer, and the days shorten, leading us into the cooler season of fall in the northern hemisphere.\nAstrologically, there are also other things in play.\nCristina Farella, astrologer and host of Soror Mystica podcast, says, “The fall equinox is observed when the Sun crosses out of the sign Virgo and enters the 0° of the sign Libra, ending summer and beginning autumn, officially.”\nThe transition from summer to fall isn’t just about a change in temperature (tell me about it, I have an entire mood and vibe shift!). It’s also an adjustment in the energy and rhythms of the natural world. The earth’s gradual cooling and the lengthening of nights encourage a slowdown, mirroring the natural process of harvesting and preparing for the winter months.\nHistorically, how have cultures and societies observed the equinox?\nThe fall equinox has been more than just a day of equal light and darkness. It has been a time steeped in meaning and celebration, reflecting a deep connection to the cycles of nature and the cosmos.\nIn ancient Mesopotamia and India, precise astronomical observations were vital to daily life, with the equinoxes playing a significant role in their calendars. According to\nDallas Athent, author and researcher, “People quite literally lived and died by their calendars. Their calendars meant everything.”\n“In ancient Mesopotamia and India, precise astronomical observations were vital to daily life, with the equinoxes playing a significant role in their calendars.”\nThe Incas, who revered the sun as a deity, made the equinox a time of significant ritual. Machu Picchu, the renowned archaeological site, features a stone called Intihuatana, which is aligned so that it casts no shadow at noon during the equinox. This alignment underscores the Incas’ deep reverence for the sun and their intricate understanding of its celestial path. Athent notes: “The focus on the sun and its physical placement is pretty cool!”\nIn many cultures, the fall coincides with harvest festivals. For example, Sukkot, celebrated by Jews in October, is a time to give thanks for the bounty of the earth and prepare for the coming winter. This reflects a universal theme of preparation and gratitude, resonating across different societies.\n“In many cultures, the fall equinox coincides with harvest festivals.”\nPagan traditions are also celebrated with the Mabon festival, too. As Athent found in her research, “Mabon is celebrated by picking apples and using them in rituals to thank the gods.”\nToday, modern conveniences have changed how we experience the world. Athent points out, “Even if we were to mimic fall equinox celebrations in their original forms, a lot of the meaning may be lost due to technology and convenience.”\nHow to celebrate the fall equinox\nReady to celebrate? There are quite a few big benefits to ringing in the equinox — inside and out — even though our world has changed significantly from the days of yore. “The collective, at this time of the year, benefits from pulling back from the extremes of summer, and gently setting their sights on balancing their inner and outer realms, goals, and desires,” says Farella.\n“With any transition, it gives an opportunity to reset your intentions and find a better routine. Ask yourself, ‘What do I need during this period of time?’”– Wendy Tran, LMFT\nThere’s much more to behold for your inner and outer self, too.\nWendy Tran, licensed marriage and family therapist (LMFT) and mental health recruiter, offers this food for thought: “With any transition, it gives an opportunity to reset your intentions and find a better routine,” she says. “Ask yourself, ‘What do I need during this period of time?’ Is it more rest and prioritizing sleep? Is it nurturing your body with good food to remain healthy during cold and flu season? Is it visiting a sauna or doing some light therapy to make up for the loss of heat and light? There are so many different ways to incorporate more self-care during this time.”\n1. Support your health\nThe fall equinox is a perfect time to check in with your health and well-being. As Tran suggests, “Many of us have heard of seasonal affective disorder which typically impacts folks during the fall and winter seasons. With less time in the sun, our bodies may be impacted by a vitamin D deficiency.” Checking in with your medical and mental health care providers can help you prepare for the shorter days ahead and ensure you have strategies to stay balanced and healthy.\n2. Seek balance\nEmbrace the equinox as an opportunity to find balance in your life. This might mean slowing down or, for some, stepping up your activity. According to Tran, “Balancing often means learning to be mindful day in and day out. Sometimes grounding and maintaining balance is as ‘simple’ as listening to your body.” Pay attention to your needs, whether it’s more hydration, movement, or adjusting to the changing season.\n3. Incorporate mindfulness\nAs the season shifts, sprinkle mindfulness practices into your routine. Tran notes, “Practicing acceptance can be really helpful when you have to enter into a (literal) season of life that is particularly challenging.” Whether it’s through breathwork, meditation, or simply being present, mindfulness can help you navigate the changes of the equinox with a sense of calm and acceptance.\n4. Set intentions\nUse this transitional period to set new intentions and adjust your routines. Tran shares, “With any transitions, it gives an opportunity to reset your intentions and find a better routine.” Reflect on what you need during this time, whether it’s more rest, nourishing food, or different self-care practices, and align your actions with these intentions.\n5. Go outside and engage with nature\nReconnect with nature by spending time outdoors. Tran explains, “Nature oftentimes can keep us present by helping us give in to all of our 5 senses.” Enjoy a walk, breathe in the crisp air, and immerse yourself in the beauty of fall. This can be a grounding way to embrace the season’s changes.\n6. Clean and declutter your home\nConsider a thorough home cleaning as a way to clear out physical and psychic space. Farella advises, “Getting rid of physical objects that hold energy from old cycles can be really healing.” Light candles, journal, and reflect on what balance means to you as you declutter and refresh your living space.\n7. Go within\nTake time to reflect and explore your inner world. Farella suggests, “Use this fall equinox to set your inner sights on exploring the world of your dream space, your imagination, or perhaps your deeply held feelings that are yet unprocessed.” Journaling or meditating on your thoughts can help you embrace the introspective energy of the season.\nIt’s a wonderful time to embrace the shift and find your own rhythm within it. Remember, it doesn’t have to be completely idyllic or picture-perfect. Instead, focus on finding the positives. As Tran says, “Not every season is going to be a ‘great season’ or your ‘favorite season’, but you can find good in every season.”\n“Not every season is going to be a ‘great season’ or your ‘favorite season’, but you can find good in every season.”– Wendy Tran, LMFT\nThe equinox is a moment for reflecting on how far you’ve come in this cycle, and reaping the rewards of this growth. Farella also reminds us, “The equinox is a harvest moment. What can you harvest from this summer’s season of growth? What deserves to be saved for future nourishment, and what, like a weed, should be pulled for now?”\nSeek balance in your own way, without stressing perfection. The process of finding balance is more about experimentation and understanding what elements of your life truly matter. Farella offers some advice: “The scales don’t just help us balance, they help us discern what is balanced, and therefore help us understand the value of different elements of our life.”\nEmbrace the equinox as an opportunity to enjoy the experience and focus on what feels right for you in this season of change.\nStephanie Valente is a Contributing Editor at The Good Trade.
