  "text": "HYDRAA action: 2,500 sq yards park saved in Gachibowli, road encroachments cleared in Shamirpet\nThe layout was developed in 1982 over 32 acres, with due approval from the then HUDA, reserving about 4,000 square yards for a park\nByNewsmeter Network\nHyderabad: The Hyderabad Disaster Response and Asset Protection Agency (HYDRAA) carried out coordinated enforcement action at two locations on Thursday, successfully removing encroachments and restoring public assets.\nThe HYDRAA action included safeguarding a designated park area at Gachibowli and clearing long-pending road encroachments at Shamirpet, bringing relief to the locals.\n1,500 square yards of park area encroached at Gachibowli\nIn the Gachibowli Telecom Nagar area, HYDRAA intervened to protect land earmarked for a public park. The layout was developed in 1982 over 32 acres, with due approval from the then HUDA, reserving about 4,000 square yards for a park.\nOver time, nearly 1,500 square yards were encroached upon and residential structures came up. When attempts were made to encroach upon the remaining 2,500 square yards by claiming them as plots, Telecom Nagar residents approached HYDRAA through its Prajavani grievance mechanism.\nActing on the directions of HYDRAA Commissioner AV Ranganath, officials from HYDRAA, the Revenue Department and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) conducted a field inspection and confirmed the land’s reservation as a park.\nExcluding the already-built residential portion, HYDRAA removed encroachments from the remaining 2,500 square yards, erected boards clearly marking it as parkland and installed fencing to prevent future encroachments.\nAccess to public routes was blocked in Shamirpet\nIn a separate operation, HYDRAA cleared road encroachments in Friends Colony at Shamirpet in Medchal–Malkajgiri district. The colony layout, formed in 1987 over 4.20 acres in Survey No. 1198, included a 20-foot-wide road meant for public access.\nOver the years, portions of this road were encroached upon, with boundary walls and a gate constructed, blocking access, particularly the route leading towards Shamirpet Police Station. Following a complaint to HYDRAA Prajavani, officials conducted a ground-level inquiry and confirmed the encroachment.\nOn Thursday, HYDRAA removed the illegal structures and restored the road, reopening access for residents. Locals expressed relief, stating that despite raising complaints with various departments for over 15 years, it was HYDRAA’s intervention that finally resolved the issue.\nResidents welcome action\nResidents at both locations welcomed HYDRAA’s swift action, noting that the enforcement not only protected public land but also ensured long-denied access and amenities for the community.",
