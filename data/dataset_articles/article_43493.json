  "text": "Dirk Petersen, a Northeast Community College Board of Governors member, hosted a campaign rally Wednesday ahead of the November general election. Petersen will face Timothy Miller of Norfolk, who is challenging the incumbent for his District 5 seat. This district covers Norfolk, where the college’s main campus is located. “We’re working hard on making sure our college runs like a business. Doing the right things, watching our costs … because we don’t want to keep tuition up through the roof,” Petersen told the crowd of roughly 50 people at District Table & Tap, a business he co-founded. He shared anecdotes from his upbringing, explaining his journey from a one-room schoolhouse in Pilger to earning an engineering degree from the University of Nebraska. Petersen said his 38-year career at Nucor Steel was marked by a commitment to safety and leadership development. “That was a really important thing — to make sure you develop people that work for you to be the best they can be and to be leaders to take over in the future, whether it’s a family business, like a lot of you are in, whether it’s a (corporation) like Nucor. It doesn’t really matter. We have a responsibility as leaders to do that. I look at our board that way, too.” Petersen worked as Nucor’s vice president and general manager of the Norfolk branches in his last 17 years there. He touched on his return to Nebraska in 2004 to manage the Norfolk branches, saying “it was the best day of my life.” He said Northeast’s role in alleviating workforce woes is to prepare students for the future, adding that 13,000 students across a 20-county service area attend the college. He also supported dual credit programs that allow high school students to earn college credit. “We’ve got 2,000 students in our northeast area that are in dual credit,” Petersen said. Other Norfolk officials spoke in support of Petersen at the rally, including Jeff Scherer, the board of governors chairperson; Jeanne Reigle, a former board of governors member and candidate for the District 19 state Legislature seat; Julie Robinson, a board of governors member; and Shane Clausen, president of the Norfolk City Council and candidate for Norfolk mayor. “The policy manual (at Northeast) was probably this big, and Dirk decided that we needed to go through it,” Robinson said. “I will do a lot of things, but policy work is not on my list. And he was like a dog to a bone. And I believe as of right now, every policy has been reviewed and changed and put back in order and gives us so much better governance and ability to handle what we’re doing.”",
