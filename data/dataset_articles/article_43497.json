  "text": "The singer HK and his band definitely love the Lot! They have already performed there in August and now they are back, at the Gariottes du Causse farm in Nissac, in the commune of Saint-Martin-Labouval, for a farmers’ ball this Thursday, September 19 (from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.). They support the AELC (Lot Célé Environmental Association) which is fighting to protect the Causses du Quercy regional natural park. This place, known for the beauty of its sites, the quality of its landscape, and its generous sunshine, is coveted by operators who want to install photovoltaic plants. “Ecocidal projects that would be to the detriment of local biodiversity, that would harm the trees and dry lawns of the Causse, and the region’s tourist activity” and that are not accepted by part of the population.\nHK, an activist and committed artist, sings to help finance legal appeals, especially against the TotalEnergies project (20 ha in Tour-de-Faure). The local group “Un pas d’côté” will also contribute to the musical entertainment of this gathering. You can pre-register on the HelloAsso website: www.helloasso.com/associations/aelc-association-environnementale-lot-cele/evenements/19-septembre-2024-bal-paysan-avec-hk . The organization of the event will be greatly facilitated. More information on solairelot.fr / aelc@solairelot.fr",
