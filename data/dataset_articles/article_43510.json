  "text": "When they arrived in Kloten, it was “only” a tour of the airport. The ticket was a “joke”. However, the tour was “very impressive and interesting” for the women.\nThe next destination was Winterthur, where they received instructions for “urban golf” at the tourist office. Equipped with golf clubs, balls and brushes, the women left the station building towards their accommodation in the train depot.\nAfter checking into their rooms and having a snack on the terrace of the depot, five groups of four to five women tackled the golf course starting in the Sulzer area. From the Sulzer area they went up towards Frohbergpark, past the rose garden to Büelrainpark. Everyone had a lot of fun, hitting the balls from the cobblestones into the trash cans, playing eagerly\nWe walked back to the depot. We rounded off the first day with a convivial dinner and a subsequent walk through Winterthur’s old town.\nAwakened by bats In the morning, bats woke the women from their sleep and after breakfast they marched to Winterthur train station. From there they continued to Dietikon, then took the bus to Geroldswil, where they leisurely climbed the Altberg.\nAfter more than half of the women had climbed the observation tower and were back on solid ground, there were plenty of drinks and potato salad with sausages in the Waldschenke. An espresso, house coffee or coffee Baileys rounded off the culinary offering and, strengthened, the women tackled the descent towards Weiningen.\nAfter marching more than eleven kilometers every day and taking in many new impressions around Zurich Airport, they reached Herisau train station as planned in the early evening.",
