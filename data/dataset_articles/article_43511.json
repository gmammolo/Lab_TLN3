  "text": "Nico Gonzalez, who scored last Tuesday in the Champions League match, was presented to the press a little while ago as a new Juventus player.\nHis first goal with Juventus:\n« I am very happy, it was a dream for me to score with this jersey. It was a dream for me to score with this jersey. It is also the right moment to win the match, I am very happy. »\nHis role on the ground:\n« As I said the other time, we know what to do, we have a clear idea: to be free, to take responsibility for each other, what to do on the pitch. That’s what gives the right result. That’s why we won. That’s what the coach asks (…) To play good football. The ball on the ground. That’s what we want. To get a positive result, that’s what we have to do. We all want, as a group, to have an idea. I said it. The idea is clear. We are united, compact, we are a good group, and that’s what will bring a positive result. »\nHis role on the ground:\n« When you play football, you are happy. If I have to be a goalkeeper, I do it without any problem. That is my answer. »\nHis complicity with Dusan Vlahovic:\n« Yes, I know him. He has improved a lot, really a lot. When I saw him in the first game, I said: guys, he is really strong. He hasn’t scored a goal in three games, but he is always positive, he helps the team, he is a good guy who deserves the best. If I can give him assists, that’s perfect. It’s the same for me. He is doing very well (…) Our idea is clear. We help the team. That’s our job. It’s not about scoring goals, helping, but doing our best for the team. We have to continue with this team, which brings positive results. That’s all there is to it. »\nObjective Scudetto?\n« We are Juventus. We can’t think about tomorrow. We live in this moment and we think game by game. That’s the idea. I don’t want to think about what’s next. It doesn’t work like that. To be mentally healthy, you have to think game by game. »\nThe season is going to be long:\n« For us it’s great, we are all young people who want to play. So many games is good for the team. As I heard the coach say: for this we have to rest, eat well, sleep well. Three clear objectives. »\nHis integration into Juventus:\n« I am happy, I found a great group, good guys. I have been part of the team since day one. Thank you for that. »\nThe Juventus version Thiago Motta:\n« Impressed by Juve and Thiago? He impressed me a lot, I didn’t imagine anything else, I know how Juve works. I spoke a lot with Paredes, Dybala, Soulé, Di Maria. There were many Argentines who passed through here, who are now teammates in the national team. They explained to me how everything works, the organization. I also thank him, he is great, he made me feel like a son. Thiago? He is incredible. He gives me the freedom I need to enjoy every game, every training session. I also want to thank him. »\nThe upcoming clash against Naples:\n« Of course, we want a positive result. I keep saying the same thing as before, we work day after day, training after training. When the match comes, we are ready. We have to think like that. »\nNico Gonzalez was presented to the press. 🇦🇷⚪️⚫️ pic.twitter.com/utTyYow7PQ\n— Juventus FR (@Juve_France) September 19, 2024",
