  "text": "Portenhagen (red). On Friday, September 20th, a very special evening awaits visitors to the “Zur Goldenen Glocke” restaurant in Portenhagen: The Bremen singer-songwriter Marno Howald will take the stage at 7:30 p.m. and delight the audience with his satirical, humorous and at the same time profound songs.\nMarno Howald is known for not mincing his words in his songs. With a unique mixture of irony, sarcasm and melancholy, he always hits the nerve of the times. His songs are musical snapshots that not only entertain, but also make you think. He doesn’t limit himself to a specific genre, but remains stylistically flexible. Whether it’s socially critical topics or personal experiences – Howald knows how to get to the point both skillfully and with a wink.\nThe Bremen singer-songwriter has already performed on stage with Konstantin Wecker and is one of the most unusual musicians in the German singer-songwriter scene. His lyrics are both autobiographical and romantic, sometimes biting and sometimes humorous. But one thing is certain: you never know whether Howald is singing with a mischievous smile on his face or is musically processing a “nasty” political truth.\nThe audience can look forward to a varied evening that will both make them laugh and reflect. Admission to the event is free, but donations are requested.\nThe restaurant “Zur Goldenen Glocke” at Portenhäger Straße 17 opens its doors to all music lovers who want to experience an unforgettable evening with an extraordinary artist.\nWhen? Friday, 20 September 2024, from 7:30 p.m.\nWo? “To the Golden Bell”, Portenhäger Straße 17, Portenhagen/Dassel\nEntrance fee? Free – donations are requested.\nPhoto: Marno Howald",
