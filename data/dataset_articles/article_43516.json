  "text": "HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Motorcyclists from across the Southeast gathered on Saturday, Sept. 21, for the 31st annual [Trail of Tears Commemorative Motorcycle Ride](https://www.facebook.com/Trailoftearsmotorcycle), a scenic journey across northern Alabama to honor Native Americans. The ride began in Bridgeport and traveled through North Alabama to Waterloo. Festivities included a kick-off rally in Bridgeport on Friday, featuring live music, street dances, and fireworks. Event organizers expected up to 10,000 riders to participate. The town of Waterloo is hosting an Indian Festival through Sunday, presented by the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission. Highlights of the festival include a \"living history\" exhibit of a soldier encampment, as well as demonstrations from Native American artisans and vendors. \"When I see all these bikers and these people, I hope that we're bringing awareness to that bad and dark chapter of history. and, you know, our history, good or bad, needs to be remembered,\" Ike Moore, President of Trail of Tears shares. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 called for the removal of all Indians from the eastern United States to the state of Oklahoma, whether voluntary or by force. In May 1838, the deadline for voluntary native removal, prompted the Cherokee \"Trail of Tears,\" known as one of the darkest episodes in relations between the United States and Native Americans. \"I don't remember much of what most of my teachers said, but I remember her saying, boys and girls, this is just like you and your family we're sitting at home and having dinner and soldiers showed up at the door and took you out of the house,\" Moore explains. \"You didn't finish your dinner; you didn't put on your shoes. you just got snatched up out of your house and moved away at home. I thought man, that's awful\" It was during that year that the U.S. government hired wagon master J.C.S. Hood to transport Native Americans by foot and wagon from Ross's Landing in Chattanooga, Tennessee to what is now Waterloo. Much of the journey followed what is now Highway 72, at the cost of as many as 4,000 Native American lives.
