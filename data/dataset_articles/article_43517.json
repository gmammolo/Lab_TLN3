  "text": "Every season, without fail, an animal print rises to the top of the fashion food chain. Last winter, for example, was all about mob wife -inspired leopard print . But this fall, fashionistas are trading it in for an even cooler, if not a bit unexpected, pattern that totally embraces a Western aesthetic. Yes, I'm talking about Cowboy Core cow print, and mark my words, it's about to take over fall fashion . So, grab your cowboy boots and get ready to channel Aly and AJ in Cow Belles in the most literal sense, because cattle print is totally the moo-d. Moo-ve over, leopard print PureWow editors select every item that appears on this page, and the company may earn compensation through affiliate links within the story.

Last winter, for example, was all about Why Is Cow Print So Popular Right Now? There are many reasons why cow print is so popular right now, starting with my guess that trendsetters are experiencing a wave of leopard-print fatigue. Of course, it was only a matter of time before cow print reigned supreme. Thanks to Cowboy Carter, Beyoncé's country album , the Western aesthetic has been at the forefront in 2024—see also: the rise in brown suede boots and handbags . And with cow print being the epitome of yee-haw style, it only makes sense that it would have a *huge* moment this year. How to Nail the Trend The cow print fashion trend is super easy to incorporate into your capsule wardrobe , given that cowhide often has an earth-toney palette that can easily be paired with fall neutrals like beige, black and brown. So when you find yourself reaching for a pop of print to go with your basics, resist the urge to go leopard and grab a cow-print option instead. In other words, skip your basic black silk skirt and make a statement with this rodeo-ready cow-print one . Or, just scoop up these Tory Burch Mellow studded mules ($328), which are guaranteed to take your fall fits to Bey-approved heights. Ready to get your cowgirl style on? I've rounded up eight styles that will help you pull off the cow print trend before anyone else. Giddy up! Want to know which buzzy products are *really* worth buying? Sign up for our shopping newsletter to uncover our favorite finds. 1. Tory Burch Mellow Studded Mules Tory Burch For those looking to soft launch the pattern in their OOTDs, look no further than these beautiful Tory Burch mules that will add a subtle, glamorous touch of it. Crafted from calf hair and leather, and featuring a gold hardware logo and studs for polished edge, it's safe to say they're as luxe as can be. But are they as comfortable as they are effortlessly cowgirl chic? All signs point to *yes,* especially since they have a flexible sole and suede-lined cork footbed, which one buyer says feels \"marvelously cozy\" on their feet. 2. Free People We The Free Calico Flannel Shirt Free People If there's ever a time not to pull out your go-to plaid flannel shirt, it's now. Instead, you should scoop up this cow-printed pick, which will give any fall fit some wild and Western flair. It has contrast seams and cuffed sleeves, as well as a collared neckline and pockets on the chest, so rest assured that Free People thought of everything when creating this layerable style—even down to the material, which is 100 percent cotton and 100 percent soft and comfy, per reviewers. Allegra K Trade in your basic denim skirt for this cow-print mini, and you're guaranteed to bring in the compliments 'til the cows come home. I love that it has elastic in the back for some stretch at the waist, while the brand says that its cotton fabrication \"ensures all-day comfort without compromising on style.\" And that's all that really matters, right? Well, besides the fact it's on sale at Target for as low as $31 RN! 4. Renee C Satin Cow-Print Skirt Renee C PureWow Editorial Assistant (and fashion guru) Courtney Mason recently gave us a lesson on slip skirts that proves we can incorporate the style into our wardrobes year-round. That's moo-sic to my ears when it comes to styling this on-trend option. Whether you want to keep it casual with sneakers and a knit top, dress it up with a classic button down or give it a demure twist with a tailored vest, the possibilities are endless. But here's why one buyer is obsessed with this satin piece: \"I really like that this is thicker satin and not paper thin like a lot of skirts on the market! This is the perfect addition to my work wardrobe. I’m 5-foot-4, and this skirt is the perfect length. Fits true to size.\" Sounds like it's petite-approved to boot! Getting all dressed up for a (cow)girls' night on the town? This slinky maxi will definitely get you noticed, and it's not just because it has a cool cow-print design that'll stand out in a sea of LBDs. The high neck, slim fit and cheeky cutout trim are sure to wrangle up a few head-turns in the best way. 6. WDIRARA Cow-Print Wide-Leg Jeans WDIRARA Just wait—all the cool girlies will be wearing cow-print pants this fall, so why not get ahead of the trend with these wide-leg jeans? They've earned nearly 400 5-star reviews thanks to their supposedly soft, non-stretch fabric, and there's a high chance they'll make you look snatched in all the right places. But of course, I still hit up the review section to see what they're really all about. \"The material is very nice and feels just like a rough denim. They are definitely high-wasted and fell exactly where they do on the model,\" writes one reviewer. \"They stopped right at the base of my ankle, and the flare is just as shown in the photo. I bought them for a concert and can't wait to wear them!\" Um, same, which is why I'm adding them to my cart before they sell out. 7. Aerosoles Pull-On Western Booties Aerosoles Nothing says Cowboy Core quite like a good pair of Western-inspired booties, and these certainly fit the bill. Not to mention, they'll probably be a lot more comfortable than your typical cowboy boots—they are designed by Aerosoles, after all. Between their diamond flex outsole and an OrthoLite Aerofly removable footbed, these boots are designed to offer optimal cushioning and support. So, yeah, you can say they're made for walkin', two-steppin' and everything in between. Cyrus Want an easy, low-commitment way to try out the trend? Just throw it over your shoulders in the form of a cardigan, like this number that boasts a cool, geometric-take on cow print. Not only is the oversized style totally budget-friendly ( Maxxinistas already know ), but I imagine it's also as soft and cozy as it looks due to its knit blend of rayon, polyester and nylon. And, yes, it has two front pockets, so you can keep small items on hand while you lounge around the house or head out for the day.",
