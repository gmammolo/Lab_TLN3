  "text": "24 water tanks were also provided for residents of the region south of the Municipality.\nWith an investment of more than 3.2 million pesos, the City Council of La Paz acquired two new garbage collection trucks, which were assigned to the Delegations of San Antonio and El Carrizal to improve the service in these communities, reported the Municipal President, Milena Quiroga Romero, during the delivery event.\nIn this regard, the General Director of Municipal Public Services (SEPUM), Daniel Cabral Ramírez, explained that for the first time the Delegation of El Carrizal receives a garbage truck for exclusive use in the northern area of ​​the Municipality, since previously units were sent from the city of La Paz.\n“One unit will remain in San Antonio and will also provide service in El Triunfo, El Rosario and surrounding communities. The same will apply to El Carrizal, where La Matanza, Melitón Albañez and La Trinidad will be served. Delegates will have to be organized to provide better coverage,” added the Mayor.\nLikewise, the General Directorate of Welfare and Economic Development benefited 24 families from San Antonio, San Blas and El Triunfo with the delivery of the same number of water tanks with a capacity of 1,100 liters, for which 127 thousand 855 pesos were allocated from the Municipal Social Infrastructure Fund (FAISMUN) 2024. In addition, the Municipal DIF distributed 100 cleaning packages, in order to prevent possible diseases during the current rainy season.",
