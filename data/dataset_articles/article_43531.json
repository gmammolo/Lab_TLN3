  "text": "Subscribe | UPI Odd Newsletter Subscribe Sept. 19 (UPI) -- A pair of pigs on the loose for two days in a British Columbia city were wrangled after a prolonged chase before an audience of cheering elementary school students.\nThe pigs, which had been wandering the neighborhoods of West Kelowna for at least two days, were spotted Wednesday near Mar Jok Elementary School, leading police, animal control and multiple rescue groups to respond.

So probably about 30 minutes of up and down the hills, we ended up getting him in the corner of a yard with a bit of fencing that had broken,\" Jacenda Byer of Petra's Pawdicures told Castanet.\nFaith Affleck, owner of Star's Piggly Wiggly Sanctuary, said the watching elementary school students were clearly on the side of the pig.\n\"They were cheering hard for him to 'Go, piggy, go,'\" she said.\nThe pigs are being cared for at Star's Piggly Wiggly Sanctuary while officials attempt to identify their owner.
