  "text": "[](/authors/marina-magomedova/) 19 Sep 2024 22:43 Cristiano Ronaldo, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner and forward for Saudi Arabia’s Al-Nassr, has expressed his admiration for the young talent of Barcelona winger Lamine Yamal. Ronaldo was quoted by insider Fabrizio Romano: I see (in Lamine) huge potential, great talent. He needs luck because he is very young, I hope he doesn’t get any (physical) problems. His context helped him a lot, the Spain national team is very good. I believe he is going to be one of the best players for this new generation. Yamal's current contract with Barcelona is valid until the summer of 2026. The 17-year-old player has enjoyed success with the Spanish national team, helping them win the UEFA Euro 2024. He has also been named among the nominees for the 2024 Ballon d'Or. Lamine Yamal has expressed his desire to spend his entire career with Barcelona. The young Spanish forward has also commented on the frequent comparisons made between him and Lionel Messi, the star player of Inter Miami.
