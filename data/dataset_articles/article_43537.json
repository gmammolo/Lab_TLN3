  "text": "Author, food critic, and television series host Matthew Evans adds another arrow to an already crowded quiver by hosting Grounded Australia on Fat Pig Farm, the 32-hectare farm he runs with his wife Sadie in Tasmania's Huon Valley. It will be held on December 4 and 5, and Matthew says it's no coincidence that World Soils Day is December 5. He said the decision to establish Grounded was inspired by attending Groundswell 2023 in the UK and has received the blessing from the British event to host a similar event down under. He says Grounded Australia is re-imagining farmer learning by running multiple talks and demonstrations on farms for farmers organised by farmers. Over the two days, there will be roughly 40-hour-long sessions in three large marquees with a fantastic and inspiring range of speakers. You can click [here](https://groundedaustralia.com.au/speakers/) to see a list of the proposed speakers. One of the many speaker highlights is UK farmer and author James Rebanks, who lives in the Lake District, where his family has lived and worked for more than 600 years. His number one bestselling debut, The Shepherd's Life, won the Lake District Book of the Year, was shortlisted for the Wainwright and Ondaatje prizes, and has been translated into sixteen languages. Another top-tier speaker will be Dan Kittredge, an organic farmer for more than 30 years and the founder and executive director of the Bionutrient Food Association (BFA), a non-profit whose mission is to \"increase quality in the food supply.\" Matthew said Dan is known as one of the leading proponents of \"nutrient density,\" and he works to demonstrate the connections between soil health, plant health, and human health. Iain and Di Haggerty farm more than 26,315 hectares in the West Australian wheatbelt, beginning their journey in 1994 when they bought about 660ha of land. They realised their system was vulnerable to dry seasons; input costs were steadily increasing without corresponding increases in productivity, maximising crop production in dry years had become a real struggle, and hard pans in their soils severely restricted root growth. So, the Haggerty started researching biologically based farming systems to increase their soil's microbial population, nutrient availability, and moisture-holding capacity. What followed was a massive learning curve combining and adapting some of the world's best ecological knowledge with much ground truthing and extension in harsh Western Australian semi-arid agricultural zone conditions. Matthew said that to cater to land stewards' thirst for knowledge, thought-provoking discussions on a range of topics should be held in a safe, supportive space where a diversity of views is treated with respect. He added that these talks will aim at different levels of prior knowledge while offering hope and plenty of chances for social interaction. \"That's because farming is the answer to so many of the world's ills, be it climate, soils, biodiversity, or human health,\" he said. Another exciting speaker is Dr Anita Fleming, the research manager of the Lincoln University Integral Health Dairy Farm near Christchurch, New Zealand. Matthew said Dr Fleming's expertise focused on ruminant nutrition, agricultural system design, and identification of connections between pastures, livestock, and consumers. He said Dr Fleming and her team, using metabolomic techniques, have identified metabolic signatures pertaining to different pastures that are identifiable in not only grazing cattle but also humans who consume beef. \"Anita was drawn into agricultural science following a rural upbringing. She also runs a successful dairy business in mid-Canterbury with her husband and is a practical thinker who is merging practical on-farm experience with cutting-edge, innovative science.\" Fat Pig Farm is a revitalised old apple farm that was the stage for many of Matthew's SBS television series episodes. It also plays a role in his explorations for better ways to widen the production scope for small acreages. He is trialling wheat under minimum or no-till processes but without knockdown chemicals like the glyphosate family (see the above image where the wheat is on Matthew's right and a 13-species pasture is on Sadie's left). A small strip of wheat was sown onto the ground that was flail-mowed. He says growing wheat is a natural fit for poultry and pig production but has many challenges. In the region south of Hobart, for example, only one header is available for harvesting. It's also part of a broader conversation about what suits the best methods of producing nutrient-dense food (part of the topics Dan Kittredge will explore). Organic, regenerative or conventional farming systems are close in levels of nutrient density. \"The only correlation is biological activity, how much life there is in your soil,\" Matthew said. \"That's what defines the end production.\" Grounded will run on December 4 and 5, with tickets now on sale.
