  "text": "Toni Storm will challenge for the IWGP Women’s Championship. Athena makes Ring of Honor history. WWE kicks off its inaugural WWE Speed Women’s Championship tournament. Jordan Blade chats with WrestleZone and more! Let’s break it down in this week’s edition of Women’s Wrestling Wrap-Up!\nWWE Women’s Speed Championship Tournament Kicks Off In the upcoming weeks, WWE will crown its first-ever Women’s Speed Champion. Like its male counterparts, this champion will be determined through an eight-person tournament featuring three-to-five-minute matches. So far, three women have advanced in the tournament: IYO SKY, Naomi, and Kairi Sane.\nThe inaugural WWE Speed Women’s Championship tournament kicked off on September 4 with an opening round matchup between SKY and Lyra Valkyria. Valkyria and SKY fought back and forth throughout the bout, but a surprise pinfall ultimately sealed the win for SKY.\nThe following week, Naomi defeated Blair with her Feel the Glow submission to advance to a semi-finals matchup against SKY.\nMost recently. Kairi Sane defeated Elektra Lopez with an Insane Elbow. She too now looks ahead to the semi-finals, where she will take on either Candice LeRae or Piper Niven.\nRELATED: Lyra Valkyria On Competing In The First Women’s WWE Speed Tournament: It’s A Huge Opportunity\nTODAY on #WWESpeed :\nDamage CTRL's @KAIRI_official takes on Legado del Fantasama's @elektralopezwwe ! Who will punch their ticket to the WWE Speed Semifinals? ? pic.twitter.com/TstdwugkCZ\n— WWE (@WWE) September 18, 2024 Toni Storm To Challenge Mayu Iwatani For IWGP Women’s Championship Toni Storm may be down, but her fighting spirit is not out.\nAt AEW All In, Mariah May defeated “Timeless” Toni Storm to claim the AEW Women’s World Championship. Coming off that loss, many expected Storm to request a rematch for the AEW Women’s World Championship. In a turn of events, Storm has now shifted her gaze to another title, over in the land of STARDOM and NJPW.\nLast weekend, Storm issued a challenge to IWGP Women’s Champion Mayu Iwatani in a new vignette, set by a fireplace.\n“Did you forget about me? STARDOM. Do you remember who I am? Because I have never forgotten you,” Storm said. “I have done a lot in your land. And I will always respect Japanese pro wrestling, but there is one thing that I must do. In 2017, I became the World of Stardom Champion. Some say it was a mistake. I must prove that it wasn’t. October 5th. Nagoya. I challenge you, Mayu Iwatani for the IWGP Women’s Championship. Mayu-san, you are the icon of stardom. You are the icon of Joshi Pro wrestling, but you couldn’t even wash my diaphragm. I will become IWGP Women’s Champion and I will ruin your life.”\nFormer #AEW Women’s champ Toni Storm has challenged Mayu Iwatani for her IWGP Women’s title in Nagoya 10/5! #STARDOM\npic.twitter.com/fAV8kg2Jsf\n— We Are Stardom (@we_are_stardom) September 14, 2024 Two days after Storm’s challenge, Iwatani officially accepted it . As such, she is now slated to defend the IWGP Women’s Championship at STARDOM’s Nagoya Grand Fight event on October 5. For Iwatani, this will mark her first title defense since June, when she defeated Tsukasa Fujimoto in Ice Ribbon by referee’s decision. For Storm, this will mark first STARDOM match since July 2019, when she, Iwatani, and Arisa Hoshiki beat Andras Miyagi, Kagetsu, and Natsuko Tora in six-woman tag action.\nAthena Makes Ring of Honor History Earlier this week, Athena cemented herself as the longest-reigning champion in Ring of Honor. This feat comes after Athena, the current ROH Women’s Champion, surpassed Samoa Joe’s previous 645-day reign as ROH World Champion.\nThe long-time women’s champion has commented on her impressive accomplishment through a post on Twitter . She wrote:\n“I have tried to write this a billion times and figure out the right words to say and i still dont think i know what to say… But it boils down to this I am thankful for my minions that have supported me. I am thankful for all the trolls that give me the motivation to prove them wrong. I am thankful to every hussy I have beaten along the way to show everyone that I am the THE BEST IN THE WORLD!!!! With love and anger, Athena”\n. @ringofhonor\nI have tried to write this a billion times and figure out the right words to say and i still dont think i know what to say…\nBut it boils down to this I am thankful for my minions that have supported me.
