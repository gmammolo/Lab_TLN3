  "text": "Ken Shamrock has signed a Legends contract with the WWE.\nThe WWE and UFC legend was a big star during the Attitude Era. Despite only spending two years with the WWE, Ken Shamrock had some huge feuds during this time.\nHe had big matches with star like Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart and The Undertaker, and was a part of Vince McMahon’s “The Corporation” stable. Shamrock won the Intercontinental and Tag Team titles in the WWE, while also becoming the King of the Ring in 1998.\nUnfortunately, he left the company in 1999 to return to MMA. He subsequently returned to wrestling with TNA in 2002, becoming the first NWA World Heavyweight Champion in TNA history.\nKen Shamrock is fondly remembered by fans, and his contributions to the WWE have earned him a legends deal with the company.\nHe recently appeared on Insight with Chris Van Vliet where he confirmed that he was under a Legends contract with the WWE.\nKen Shamrock added that he’s part of the WWE family, and will be forever.\n“I’ve had a relationship with them forever, even since when I went away, we did a legends contract, so I’ve always been a part of them. It’s one of those things where I think I spent enough time there and did enough there that I feel like I’m a part of that family forever.”\nWhen asked bluntly if he is under a legend’s contract with the WWE, Ken Shamrock said “I am. Yes.”\nThis marks Ken Shamrock’s first return to the WWE in 25 years.\nRead More: Ken Shamrock: Nobody In Pro Wrestling Could Have Held A Candle To Me As A Shoot Fighter",
