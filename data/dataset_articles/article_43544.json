  "text": "Tyrus thinks Donald Trump is the real people’s champion, despite criticism aimed at him.\nThe former NWA World’s Heavyweight Champion has not kept his political leanings a secret in recent times. He wore the NWA title proudly on TV for months as a regular contributor to the Fox News late-night program Gutfeld !\nHe is part of a panel that discusses the major political discussions of that week. However, even after losing his belt and retiring, he remains a key fixture of the show. He even appeared on a Superbowl advert last year , giving the NWA more promotion than they’ve had in years.\nFNC's @greggutfeld ad airs during Super Bowl halftime pic.twitter.com/IbqpukwU7c\n— Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) February 13, 2023 In a recent episode of the show, Tyrus was sat next to former US President Donald Trump . The WWE Hall of Famer is still campaigning for this year’s election, as he aims to beat Kamala Harris and sit in the White House again.\nWanting to show his appreciation for Trump, the former NWA Champion handed him his own custom championship. The gold belt was emblazoned with “Trump 2024” on the front, showing Fox’s support for his campaign.\n“Thank you for WrestleMania IV and V, by the way” Tyrus said, referencing the events that were held at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City. “Thank you very much. But if you’re going to sit in that chair. If you’re going to do the Tyrus experience, you have to do it right. Because you are the people’s champion, Mr Trump.”\nDonald Trump was impressed at how heavy the belt was, exclaiming that it was a “real one”. Tyrus the joked with the former President, yelling “Like I’m gonna give a fake belt to the next President of the US!”.\nTyrus replied to the video on Twitter, simply calling him “The people’s champion”\nThe people’s champion https://t.co/OmQWP8ZpeO\n— Tyrus (@PlanetTyrus) September 19, 2024",
