  "text": "Jaci Yula (Courtesy photo)\nJulie Burton (Courtesy photo)\nShow Caption 1 of 2 Jaci Yula (Courtesy photo)\nExpand A new school year means new faces and Ayres Elementary has quite a few, nine to be exact.\nJaci Yula Jaci Yula is a new second grade teacher. She was born and raised in Sterling and education has always been in her family with both of her parents teaching in the district for a combined 65 years. Yula taught for three years at the college level and loved every minute of it.\n“Truly I’ve been ‘teaching’ and educating since high school, however; whether it be choreography, trainings for communities and behavioral health populations, or coaching. Now, I’m excited to educate our future leaders,” Yula said.\nWhile she has been in marketing and advertising all of her professional career, she wanted to do something where she truly felt she was making a difference in the lives of children, so she turned to teaching. She also thought the school schedule would be very nice so that she has the opportunity to spend more time with her own two children.\nAs for why she decided to join the staff at Ayres, Yula said it’s simple, she loves kids. She works in the community with Sterling Miracle Players and the SHS Theatre Program and loves spending time getting to know each student.\n“I am blessed to have amazing educational mentors from my husband John, both of my parents, Bernie and Melverie Mathis, and also my mother-in-law Mary Yula. Your advice, mentorship, and keys for success have been heard and will be used now and in the future. Even if you don’t think I’m listening,” Yula said.\nJulie Burton Another new face is first grease teacher Julie Burton. She is from Sterling but grew up in Akron. Her primary education is in soil and crop sciences/agronomy.\nBurton quietly wanted to go into the education field for years. Countless professional assessments steered her toward teaching, however, she found herself securely in a position in the banking world for 20+ years.\n“It made me a little unsure about making the move to education,” she said.\nBut after several summers of discussions with the RE-1 Valley administration, she decided to take the plunge and apply. She was offered a position at Ayres quickly after her interview and everything fell together.\n“I love teaching in general. Seeing someone have those ‘ah ha moments’ is incredibly fulfilling for me,” Burton said, adding that she chose elementary education because she loves children, the way they absorb things like a sponge and love unconditionally with no ulterior motives. “Education allows me something with the time I have on Earth that truly impacts others. The future of our world is in our classrooms today!”\nTori Karr\nAlso joining the staff is kindergarten teacher Tori Karr. She is from Wyoming and is currently enrolled in the T-Prep program through Northeastern Junior College seeking her bachelor’s degree in elementary education.\nKarr chose to go into education to give back. Growing up she had many amazing teachers who truly shaped who she is today.\n“I hope that I can encourage my students to dream and find a true love for learning,” she said.\nKarr decded to join Ayres because she was ready for a career change.\n“I wanted to do something that would make a difference and I’ve always loved working with children. It’s an amazing opportunity to get to teach while going to school and I’m blessed to be a part of the awesome team at RE-1 Valley,” she said.\nOthers joining the staff are kindergarten teacher Micaela Prettyman, librarian Kyra Essman, teacher assistants Ally Seriani and Aaliyah Ingram and social emotional learning specialist Joyce Vasquez and new to the school but not new to the district is Kaitlin Kirschbaum who transferred over from Sterling Middle School to teach second grade.",
