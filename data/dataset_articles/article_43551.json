  "text": "Senior Research Associate Tanu Parmar, PhD was selected to participate in the [2024 ](https://www.eyeresearch.org/emerging-vision-scientist-program)[Emerging Vision Scientists Program](https://www.eyeresearch.org/emerging-vision-scientist-program), held September 16-17, 2024 in Washington, DC. The program is run by the Alliance for Eye and Vision Research (AEVR) and is sponsored by Research to Prevent Blindness. During the event, Parmar had the opportunity to present the cutting-edge research happening at Duke Eye Center and meet with and educate many congressional members about the importance of vision research. The program provided an excellent platform to bridge the gap between the scientific community and legislative bodies and advocate for continued support and investment in vision science. Parmar said about the event, \"I strongly believe that these efforts are crucial in raising awareness about the importance of vision health and the need for continued investment in scientific research to combat eye diseases that affect millions of Americans.\"",
