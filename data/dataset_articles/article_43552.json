  "text": "The idea came from the bride's mother who “coordinated, choreographed and recorded” the dance to send to family members so they could practice\nBy Kimberlee Speakman Kimberlee Speakman Kimberlee Speakman is a digital writer at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2022. Her work has previously appeared in Forbes and she has also worked in broadcast television as a reporter for Hawaii-based news station KHON2 News. People Editorial Guidelines Published on September 19, 2024 03:53PM EDT Comments One bride got the surprise of her life on her big day!\nIn a new viral video, shared by Storyful, bride Katherine Martineau can be seen at her wedding in Montreal, Canada, where her family members and friends broke out in a choreographed dance to ABBA' s hit song “Dancing Queen.”\nIn the video, the bride could be seen on the balcony of the St. James Theatre in Montreal getting ready to toss her bouquet into the crowd of guests who gathered below before the song suddenly came on and the crowd broke out into a dance filled with several iconic moves — similar to the ones featured in the Mamma Mia! movie.\nDozens of the wedding guests could be seen moving in sync with practiced moves as they pointed up to the bride, waved their hands in the air from side to side, clapped and moved about the dance floor with big smiles on their faces.\nBride Surprises Her Parents with Emotional First Dance at Her Wedding 25 Years After They Eloped The bride “was the only person” at the reception “who had no idea” that her guests had planned to do this, Melissa Bizdikian, who captured the video, told Storyful.\n“In her mind, the plan was to do a bouquet toss over the balcony but a flash mob broke out!,” Bizdikian said.\nThe idea for the dance came from her mother, who “coordinated, choreographed and recorded” the dance to send to family members so they could practice ahead of time, according to Good Morning America , which reshared the video.\nBride’s Mother Surprises Her at Wedding by Performing ABBA Song in Costume — Watch! Martineau could be seen in the video turning to her groom, Jim Haesaerts, who was standing next to her in shock before breaking out into a wide smile, seemingly overjoyed by the display.\nThe pair shared a sweet moment as they embraced and the groom kissed his new bride on the forehead before they turned back to watch their guests perform from the balcony. As the dance went on, the bride could be seen swaying along to the music as the groom clapped in time with the song.\nABBA songs appear to be a popular choice for weddings, as another bride in California was surprised by a performance from her mother and some friends who danced to ABBA’s classic “Super Trooper” on stage last year.\nFor that performance, the bride's mother danced and lip-synced the words to the song and incorporated the same moves from the film including pointing up and to the side, and wiggling her hands — all while in similar flare pants from the film.\nComments All comments are subject to our Community Guidelines .
