  "text": "The Golden State Warriors are entering the new NBA season as underdogs in the Western Conference. After years of being the pace setters in the NBA, their new position within the league is likely taking some getting used to, and perhaps even firing up some of the veteran players to prove the doubters wrong. Recently, an anonymous NBA coach likened Golden State to an aging rock band that's still on tour. The comment came during an interview with Steve Bulpett of Heavy on Sports. Those comments wouldn't have sat well with the Warriors roster, many of whom are just two years removed from their last championship with the franchise. “I was thinking about this the other day,” [The coach told Bulpett.] During a recent interview with Laura Britt of NBC Sports Bay Area, Brandin Podziemski admitted that the Warriors' don't enjoy hearing that sort of criticism but are using it as fuel ahead of the new season. He also noted how the lower expectations will allow Golden State to play freely next season, which could help them unlock a level that we didn't see last season. “We don’t love to hear that, but we love to hear that in the fact that we’re going to do something that no one expects us to do,” Podziemski said. “They don’t think that we’re the Warriors that we were before, and for us, I think it’s just the best feeling when you don’t have anything to lose out there, and you just go out and prove people wrong. I think there’s a bunch of guys with that mentality that thrive off proving people wrong, and I know Steph [Curry] is one of those guys. So just to be alongside him in the backcourt and in combination with all of our other guys, we’re just excited to prove people wrong.” After adding De'Anthony Melton, Kyle Anderson and Buddy Hield this summer, Golden State will have a deeper, more talented team than the one Steve Kerr had available to him last season. Whether that additional depth will be enough to catapult the Warriors back into championship contention will remain to be seen. One thing is for sure, though: counting out Steph Curry before the season has even begun could prove to be a costly mistake. This post originally appeared on Warriors Wire !
