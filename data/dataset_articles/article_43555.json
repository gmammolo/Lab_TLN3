  "text": "Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow says that Tom Brady helped him in a key area before the 2024 season. Burrow, during an appearance on the \"Rich Eisen Show,\" revealed that he uses every chance he can to pick the brains of legends like Brady and Peyton Manning. \"I've talked to Tom several times this offseason,\" Burrow said. \"He's a good resource for me. Peyton, I've known Peyton since after my first year at LSU, you know he's helped me a lot along the road. And so whenever I get a chance to pick those guy's brains about how they operated, what their process was, how they thought about certain things, maybe it's not even football, maybe it's off the field, how they handle certain things, that's always an opportunity that I'm going to take advantage of.\" But the one thing Burrow singled out as the most important from Brady was \"how to handle off-the-field situations\" away from the team in a way that sets him up for success. Burrow wouldn't dive deeper when prompted, beyond hints it pertains to real-world items like friends, relationships, etc. For Bengals fans, it has to be nice to hear that Burrow has access to one of the best possible resources when it comes to dealing with all that comes with being a top NFL passer.
