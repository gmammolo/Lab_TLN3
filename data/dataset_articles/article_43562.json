Oktoberfest is here! Get ready for the smell of sizzling bratwurst, the clinking of beer steins, the merry sounds of polka bands, and a good ol’ time.

Sure, the endless beers and brats play a part, but nothing compares to the joy of celebrating with friends and family. So grab a friend or two and gear up to experience Oktoberfest, Texas-style!
