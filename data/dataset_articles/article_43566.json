Staging at Los Angeles’ The Bellwether, the event will unite the folk-rock mainstays–recently slimmed down to the two core members Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith–with an impressive rotation of special guests, tapping some of the biggest bands in the worlds of alternative and indie rock for a thrilling holiday get-together. The band’s second annual Christmas show will stage on December 7, and fans can expect more information on the guests to attend as the event approaches.\nDawes debuted their “Dawes & Friends: Christmas in LA” format in 2023, assuming the spotlight on Dec. 9, 2023. Through the course of the evening, the group–then also featuring keyboardist Lee Pardini–performed 17 originals and fan favorites from their guests, liberally sprinkling in Christmas-themed entries. The friends to support Dawes included X Ambassadors’ Sam Nelson, who covered Donny Hathaway’s “This Christmas,” Panic! At the Disco’s Mike Viola, who gave his own “Paul McCartney” and Dawes’ “Comes in Waves,” Matt Koma of Winnetka Bowling League, who shared his band’s “Feeling California” and his hosts’ “When the Tequila Runs Out” and Madison Cunningham, who performed “Broken Harvest” with the band.\nThe evening’s latter half saw a highlight with the arrival of My Morning Jacket’s Jim James and Bo Koster, who issued their classic “Oh My Christmas Tree” with the Dawes trio. The final familiar face to join was Simon Dawes co-founder Blake Mills, who shared his original “Skeleton Is Walking” before returning to Dawes’ roots with the Simon Dawes favorites “Lazy Daisy” and “Salute the Institution.” If last year’s show is any indication, fans can look forward to a star-studded celebration of Dawes’ catalog and community at their 2024 Christmas show.\nPre-sale tickets for “Dawes & Friends: Christmas in LA” are available now with code HOUSEPARTIES.
