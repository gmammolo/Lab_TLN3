  "text": "Former Browns kicker Phil Dawson will be honored as a Browns legend this weekend. Joshua Gunter, cleveland.com\nBy Dan Labbe, cleveland.com BEREA, Ohio — It’s fitting that former Browns left tackle Joe Thomas crashed the Zoom call for kicker Phil Dawson, a member of the 2024 Browns Legends class being inducted this weekend. Earlier in the call, he cited the support he got from players like Thomas when discussing his longevity in the NFL.\n“I got a message from Joe Thomas this morning and the things he said to me, I can’t even believe because I was just the kicker over there doing my thing,” Dawson said, “and here’s the greatest left tackle to ever play professional football thanking me for the job I did and how I helped him. That’s the special sauce, when your teammates and coaches could count on you to do your job. I can’t think of anything more rewarding than that.”\nMore Cleveland Browns coverage The on-the-fly adjustment the Browns made with Denzel Ward: Defensive takeaways Giants vs. Browns NFL Week 3 prediction, odds and best bet: Can Cleveland cover a big spread?
