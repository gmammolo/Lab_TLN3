  "text": "Travis Head gave a solid batting display against England in the first ODI at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. Head scored an unbeaten 154 from 129 balls as the Aussies chased down England's score of 315. Australia scored 317\\/3 in just 44 overs as the visitors claimed a 1-0 lead in the five-match series. Marnus Labuschagne made his presence felt with an unbeaten 77. Head took the charge for Australia and came out unscathed. Head looked a bit sketchy in the powerplay but found his substance and played aggressive cricket. His blitz helped Australia stay ahead of the asking rate. He shared fifty-plus stands alongside Steve Smith and Cameron Green before adding an unbeaten century-plus partnership with Labuschagne. Head hit 20 fours and five sixes (SR: 119.38). Head's solid 154* takes him to 2,551 runs from 66 ODIs at 44.75. In addition to 6 tons, he has slammed 16 fifties. As per ESPNcricinfo, in 15 matches versus England, Head owns 800 runs at 61.53. This was his 2nd ton versus England (50s: 6). Head also surpassed 100 fours (101) versus England. Head has gone past 1,500 away runs (home of opposition) in ODIs. He has 1,554 runs at 45.70. This was his 3rd ton in away matches (50s: 10). Highest scores for Australia vs England in ODIs: 161* - Shane Watson, Melbourne, 2011; 154* - Travis Head, Nottingham, 2024; 152 - Travis Head, Melbourne, 2022.",
