  "text": "AwkwardLookMonkeyPuppet English19•4 hours ago\nPhysical therapy will rapidly accelerate your recovery time and results.\n[@[email protected]]http://lemmy.world/u/henfredemars@infosec.pub English46•5 hours ago\nOne is a requirement to be an organism. The other is a nice to have. A great many creatures simply die after reproducing, for example, which we can interpret to mean the minimum requirement has been met and anything beyond that isn’t as important, if we like to view it that way.\nForming that small person is also a bit of a chaotic and messy process involving chance errors of various kinds and variations in the way parts grew. In a sense, the person formed would never be exactly the same if you tried again with the same inputs either.\nThat this system works as well as it does is a miracle.\nEDIT: Missing words.\n[@[email protected]]http://lemmy.world/u/jballs@sh.itjust.works English4•30 minutes ago\nI feel like once you hit your 40s, you really start to understand that concept of your body only being evolved enough to ensure that you can reproduce and the next generation survives.\nIn your 40s and you hurt your knee? Fuck you, your knee now hurts for the rest of your life - why aren’t you dead already?\n[@[email protected]]http://lemmy.world/u/henfredemars@infosec.pub English2•28 minutes ago\nMeanwhile, kids take hits all the time that would kill me instantly.\n[@[email protected]]http://lemmy.world/u/jballs@sh.itjust.works English2•12 minutes ago\nWhen my son was a toddler, he went down a slide feet first but on his stomach. I had a complete brain fart and forgot to catch him at the bottom of the slide like I had always done in the past. He few about 3 feet, then landed on the ground on his stomach, his head whipped back and then slammed face first into the ground.\nI remember thinking at the time, Jesus Christ, I would be DEAD if that happened to me. But yeah, he cried a little bit and walked it off.\nHubertManne 23•5 hours ago\nSo if I don’t have kids I can be immortal. I can be the midlander. THERE CAN BE MORE THAN ONE!\n[@[email protected]]http://lemmy.world/u/henfredemars@infosec.pub English9•5 hours ago\nYou die and whatever factors that lead you to not reproduce will become less common in the future.\nThat’s the theory anyway!\nHubertManne 14•4 hours ago\nWoohoo. Income inequality and pollution will become less common.\n[@[email protected]]http://lemmy.world/u/Kecessa@sh.itjust.works 8•4 hours ago\nFree will and vasectomies will become less common!\n@HeyThisIsntTheYMCA English1•41 minutes ago\nexplosive public shitstorms will become less common!\nThe Picard ManeuverOP 9•5 hours ago\nNature is messy and incredible.\n[@[email protected]]http://lemmy.world/u/imaqtpie@sh.itjust.works 12•5 hours ago\nHave you tried jizzing on the ankle? That’s the secret sauce.\n[@[email protected]]http://lemmy.world/u/Imgonnatrythis@sh.itjust.works 4•3 hours ago\nTrue, this can knock it down to like 4 years.\nbizarroland 3•4 hours ago\nNo way. That’s how you get a second ankle and then you got to support it for 18 years before it makes its way in the world.\n[@[email protected]]http://lemmy.world/u/itsgroundhogdayagain@lemmy.ml 16•5 hours ago\nOh good. 4 more years to go.\n@SpruceBringsteen 7•4 hours ago\nReminds me of this\nscene HEXN3T 1•34 minutes ago\nΘ∆?\nbizarroland 4•4 hours ago\nDoes anyone else just want those bacta tanks that they had Luke floating in after his hand was cut off or is that just me?\nI bet you could do some serious shit to a person if you had something like that. Just crawl back into this cyber womb and we’ll get you fixed up in a week.\n@Exulion 2•52 minutes ago\nStill couldn’t regrow limbs. Would definitely be nice though.",
