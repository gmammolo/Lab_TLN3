The US Board of Geographic Names voted on Wednesday in favor of a request from the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians to officially change the name Clingmans Dome to Kuwohi, according to a news release from the park. The Cherokee name for the mountain translates to mulberry place. The Great Smoky National Park team was proud to support this effort to officially restore the mountain and to recognize its importance to the Cherokee People, Superintendent Cassius Cash said in the release. The Cherokee People have had strong connections to Kuwohi and the surrounding area, long before the land became a national park. The National Park Service looks forward to continuing to work with the Cherokee People to share their story and preserve this landscape together. https://www.yahoo.com/news/smoky-mountains-highest-peak-returns-022638709.html [InfoView thread info, including edit history](/?com=thread&info=1&address=100219481651) [TrashPut this thread in your Trash Can (My DU » Trash Can)](/?com=login) [BookmarkAdd this thread to your Bookmarks (My DU » Bookmarks)](/?com=login)14 replies, 916 views [ShareGet links to this post and/or share on social media] [AlertAlert this post for a rule violation](/?com=login) [PowersThere are no powers you can use on this post] [EditCannot edit other people's posts] [ReplyReply to this post](/?com=post&post&forum=1002&pid=19481651) [EditCannot edit other people's posts] [Rec (56)] [ReplyReply to this post](/?com=post&forum=1002&pid=19481651) [NoneDon't highlight anything](#!)

Lots and lots of dead Firs and hemlocks from insects, but the 360 view far away is amazing. Too touristy for me, we took Dendrology students there every year for high elevation tree ID. But if youre close, well worth a look. And Cherokee just legalized rec weed. But I would not attempt to buy and do takeout. The surrounding counties will not play, and these police are hard core MAGAs. Waiting at the tribal boundaries for hippies.

I live just one mile outside of Cherokee and I have not seen a step up by law enforcement since the first few days of them opening the dispensary. Everyone I know just drives to the dispensary, purchases what they want and then drive home with no problems. Cherokee does have to fly their product via helicopter from their land where they are growing it to the boundary, because the Swain County Sheriff threatened to stop the transport. On a political note----our current Congressman, Chuck Edwards (R), came out strongly against Cherokee selling cannibis, going as far as to suggest he would introduce laws taking away Tribal sovereignty and funding. The Democratic candidate, Caleb Rudow is working hard to get the Cherokee people's vote. (34,515 posts) [maxsolomon](/?com=profile&uid=105187) \"Clingman's Dome\" always sounded gross. Now change Mt. Rainier back to Tahoma. (15,535 posts) [leftieNanner](/?com=profile&uid=266513) (28,294 posts) [LisaM](/?com=profile&uid=103353) I kind of like when places are known by both names, unless there is some compelling reason to change it to just one name (which in this case, it sounds as if there was, another example being Squaw Peak). A lot of places traditionally have multiple names. I have no issue with that.

Anyone know how to pronounce that name? (71,799 posts) [Botany](/?com=profile&uid=159729) The original Americans need to be honored and respected. Kuwohi is a beautiful name.

Clingman was a lawyer, former U.S. House member and was serving in the U.S. Senate at the time. He gave that up to join the forces of the CSA in 1861. That said, his eventual siding with seditionists is enough to have his name removed. That the mountain's name was changed to reflect the native culture of the area, much like Denali in Alaska, is fitting.",
