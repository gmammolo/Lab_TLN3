  "text": "[Schools](/maryland/belair/schools) $92K State Grant Awarded To Harford Community College For Childcare Apprenticeship Program Harford Community College has received a $92K state grant to support its childcare apprenticeship program. HARFORD COUNTY, MD — The Maryland State Department of Education has awarded $92,578 grant to Harford Community College for its childcare apprenticeship program. The only program of its kind in Maryland, the grant will be used to support the apprenticeship program that will become part of the statewide Child Care Career and Professional Development Fund and include preparation for the Child Development Associate exam and portfolio submission. Launched in early 2023, the childcare apprenticeship program at Harford Community College is part of its behavioral and social sciences division. Managed by a part-time childcare apprenticeship coordinator and supported by instructors, the program integrates field experiences with classroom learning, catering specifically to childcare professionals working in licensed Maryland facilities. The apprenticeship is designed to meet the new standards outlined in the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future. Find out what's happening in Bel Airwith free, real-time updates from Patch.
