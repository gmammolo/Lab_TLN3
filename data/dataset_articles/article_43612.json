  "text": "VIGO COUNTY, Ind. (WTHI) - At the Terre Haute Convention Center, tourism officials are celebrating a record-breaking year for tourism revenue in Terre Haute. On Thursday, the Terre Haute Convention and Visitors Bureau hosted a \"Tourism update event.\" In 2022, visitors spent $283 million annually. In 2023, revenue topped that number by 14.8%. Mayor Brandon Sakbun says the city's tourism revenue for 2024, is already ahead of last year by 18 percent, with still three months to go. Another success the event highlighted was Hulman Links being recognized as the best golf course in the state of Indiana. As well as the city being named a premier college town. The mayor says these accomplishments create a lot of potential to keep moving forward. \"You need to keep adding to your deck, adding to your portfolio, cause if not, another community is, right? Sakbun said. \"So we have got to evaluate these opportunities, as well as recognize the performances we got.\" The addition of the new downtown hotel will be Terre Haute's biggest feature in tourism in the near future. There will be dining, drinking, and pedestrian sky bridges connecting to the convention center, that will come with the new hotel. \"This helps in some of those winter months when it is a little bit cold, bringing more conventions and trade shows to the community,\" Sakbun said. \"Where we really need to get to is leveraging a Hulman center, a convention center, and a downtown, instead of just a downtown and a convention center.\" Chris Switzer, the Vigo County commissioner says there are more upcoming projects being tossed around. Some of them he couldn't tell me. One of those is a renovation of the Indiana theatre. He says that could be a $15 to $30 million project, depending on how they go about improving it. Another potential project that he says continues to come up in conversations is a sports park east of Terre Haute. The sports park would be an indoor-outdoor athletic complex. He says that the project can't move forward without proper funding. \"We were certainly a little underwhelmed with the ready funds that we received in this region,\" Switzer said. \"That would be a big part of spurring that project immediately.\" The mayor also says the city is looking at the demolition of the downtown former police station. The mayor says a multi-use facility will replace it, with commercial and retail opportunities on the 1st floor, and residential opportunities on the 2nd, third, and fourth floor. The mayor says tourism features in Indianapolis have been a big inspiration. \"Indianapolis is one of the premier convention destinations in the United States of America,\" Sakbun said. \"While we don't have that downtown capability just due to our size, you take a scaled-down approach and model it off of that.\" The mayor says the next steps will be to start demolition of the old Vigo County School Corporation building for the new downtown hotel. That will start this fall.",
