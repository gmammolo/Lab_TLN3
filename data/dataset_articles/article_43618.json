  "text": "If you or a loved one have breast cancer, you are not alone. With support groups at local hospitals and the Susan G. Komen’s Share Your Story project, women can draw strength from one another (we’ve listed a number of tools and resources at the end of this article). One local breast cancer survivor, Carolyn Hersh, spoke to TBN about her journey. Hersh was 54 years old at diagnosis and never missed an annual mammogram since age 40. With no family history of breast cancer and genetic testing indicating she did not have the BRCA gene, she was surprised when she learned that she had triple negative breast cancer, Stage 2 (because of size of the tumor). “Luckily there was no lymph node involvement or worse, which would have made it Stage 3 or 4 respectively,” said Hersh. She was diagnosed Dec. 30, 2022 and because it was triple negative, she had 16 rounds of chemotherapy before surgery. “The first 4 rounds are fondly nicknamed ‘Red Devil’ because they are red in color, and so potent that you can only have 4 rounds of them in a lifetime,” she said. After the chemo rounds and concurrent immunotherapy injections, Hersh met with her Moffitt oncologist. “Because I responded so favorably to the treatment and my tumor had shrunk, I was able to choose a less invasive surgery,” she said. “Choosing the lumpectomy immediately required me to go through 15 radiation treatments, but I was able to forgo the invasive surgery.” Some bad news required other interventional treatments. Pathology results revealed Hersh still had live cancer cells in the tumor. She wound up taking nearly 900 doses of pills. “All in all, I had 16 chemo infusions through my port, 15 Keytruda immunotherapy infusions, three hospitalizations, two surgeries, 15 radiations, and the above-mentioned pills!” she said. “This was over an 18-month period.” Today, Hersh has been in “active observation,” formerly called remission, for about 4 months. “I don’t worry about it coming back per se, but I do have some residual side effects which stay at the forefront of my daily living,” she said. “I was hospitalized once for Neutropenia (a common side effect of chemotherapy because of what it does to your blood and immune system), once for the surgery, and a third time for a hematoma related to the lumpectomy.” She still does regular mammograms. “I grew up in a household where you get your teeth cleaned twice a year, and at appropriate ages, you get annual exams, so this was my life. Because TNBC is fast growing and aggressive, I can’t even imagine what my prognosis would have been if it hadn’t been found in a routine mammogram,” she said, recommending that women find a good physician and oncologist and trust their knowledge. Each woman’s journey is unique, says Hersh, and although it is terrifying, you are not alone. “The biggest thing I can say about mental health during this journey has been to stay off of any internet searches outside of those written by medical professionals,” she said. “This is a very scary time, and I learned very early that my journey is not like any other woman’s journey, and the internet can be a landfill of stories with negative outcomes. I’ve also turned to Pilates as a recovery tool and have found it to ease my mind and aches and pains.” Hersh’s encore chapter started August 1, when she retired from her 21-year career as an Allstate agent. “The cancer did have an impact on my decision,” she says. She will continue her work with Dogs, Inc. (formally Southeastern Guide Dogs) as a puppy raiser, the New Port Richey Rotary and plans to be a Moffitt volunteer. What You Need to Know Know your family history and consult your physician about your risk for breast cancer. Depending on your age and family history, your physician will remind you how frequently you should get a mammogram and how to do a monthly at-home examination. An excellent website to help women navigate breast cancer detection and treatment can be found at the Susan G. Komen website. SGK’s mission is to save lives by meeting the most critical needs in communities and investing in breakthrough research to prevent and cure breast cancer. Its real-women journeys provide a beacon of hope to those going through the cancer diagnosis and treatment journey.
