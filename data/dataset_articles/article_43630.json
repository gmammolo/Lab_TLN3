  "text": "By Amanda-Marie Howard ,\n3 hours ago Bob Donnan-Imagn Images The Los Angeles Chargers are currently 2-0, which has been a rarity. And this week’s matchup will be a big test of their new and improved team. Here are their 5 keys to victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers:\nLos Angeles Chargers Keys to Victory More J.K. Dobbins (And Other Chargers Running Backs) J.K. Dobbins is having a time. He’s the first Charger since Hall of Fame running back LaDainian Tomlinson to have more than 130 rushing yards in back-to-back games. He’s become the standout running back in this offense throughout the last two weeks and has shown he’s up to the challenge.\nHis highlight moment this past game was the breakout run up the sideline and the front flip into the end zone for the touchdown.\nThe Steelers’ run defense did well this past week but the Broncos don’t have good running backs to contend with. They will have Dobbins’ number this next game, but with the confidence these two past matchups have given him, he’ll still be a force.\nRunning back Gus Edwards will hopefully make more of an impact in terms of rushing yards this next game, it’s great that Dobbins is doing well, but with his injury history, too much activity is a worry for him.\nGive Justin Herbert Time To Make Plays With His Legs Bob Donnan-Imagn Images Since the pass and run blocking was much better this week, when quarterback Justin Herbert was pressured, he turned those broken plays into productive ones.\nAccording to Pro Football Focus (PFF) Herbert’s average time to throw on all dropbacks last week was 2.59 seconds while this week it was 3.05 .\nOn the fourth drive of the third quarter, Herbert was pressured and rolled out to his right, where he was able to make a completion to wide receiver Quentin Johnston for the first down. And similarly on the fourth drive of the second quarter, Herbert got an open lane and scrambled for positive yardage.\nNow Herbert couldn’t always produce. A few plays after he completed a pass to Johnston in the third quarter, the pocket collapsed, and he turned over the football.\nThe pass rush in Pittsburgh, with Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt and defensive lineman Cameron Heyward, is going to be similar to the pass rush from Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby and defensive tackle Christian Wilkins. If the protection can hold up, the more Herbert is making plays with his legs, the better.\nHerbert started the week on the injury report. He did not practice on Wednesday.\nButton Up The Run Defense Dale Zanine-Imagn Images Running back Chuba Hubbard only had 64 rushing yards but had two explosive runs of over10-yards. One of those occurred during the first drive of the third quarter, where Hubbard made a few people miss for a 23-yard gain and it was up to safety Derwin James to push him out of bounds.\nThe Chargers defense managed to stop the run well enough throughout but runaway moments like Hubbard’s are worrisome. They will see a lot of rushing attempts when facing Steelers running back Najee Harris and quarterback Justin Fields . The Chargers can’t let any of these rushes get away from them or it’s going to be a long game.\nContain Justin Fields (or Russell Wilson ) The Chargers pass rush has been firing on all cylinders so far this year. Edge rusher Joey Bosa had another sack this past week while linebacker Denzel Perryman also had his first sack of the season.\nThe Chargers just have to use the weapons at their disposal to make sure that Fields can’t escape the pocket and make plays with his legs. If Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson is playing, which doesn’t seem likely, it’s really just a matter of doing the same and collapsing the pocket, as Wilson is not as mobile, especially since he’s been recovering from a calf injury. So a heavy pass rush should really disrupt him. And against a rookie center in Zach Frazier , this Chargers unit can cause damage.\nKeep Using the One-Two Punch of Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston Kirby Lee-Imagn Images The Steelers do have some great receiver coverage in safeties Minkah Fitzpatrick and DeShon Elliot , and in cornerback Joey Porter Jr. but Herbert should still continue to utilize Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston.\nJohnston went off this past week, tying his 2023 receiving touchdown total ( two) , and has double digits so far in targets (11). Johnston’s first touchdown of the game happened on the first drive when Herbert uncorked an absolute bomb to Johnston, who was running a go route. He caught the ball with Panthers cornerback Jaycee Horn in tight coverage for a 29-yard touchdown.\nThe chemistry and the trust are starting to show with these two. Johnston’s emerging as one of Herbert’s top targets. McConkey had the second most targets ( four ) last Sunday and during that first drive, managed to slip a tackle to get to the 29-yard line and most of his receptions resulted in positive yardage. Johnston is becoming that “contested catch guy” while McConkey is becoming the go-to for intricate slot route-running. Which is why, even with this receiver coverage, if Herbert can get some short passes to them, Johnston and McConkey may still be successful.\nMore must-reads:\nThe Los Angeles Chargers Have The Ultimate Secret Weapon Los Angeles Chargers News: 4 Bold Predictions, Including HUGE J.K.
