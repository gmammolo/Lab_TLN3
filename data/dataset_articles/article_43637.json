  "text": "Enhancing safety and security at Bright Local Schools By Jason Iles Superintendent Bright Local Schools At Bright Local Schools, the safety and security of our students, staff, and community is our top priority. We understand that a safe learning environment is essential for academic success and the overall well-being of our school family. With this commitment in mind, we are excited to announce a significant step in enhancing our security efforts. We have contracted services in partnership with the Highland County Sheriff Office to bring an added layer of protection through a School Resource Officer (SRO) across all Bright Local Schools. This decision comes in response to growing concerns about school safety nationwide, as well as the commitment to our strategic plan for the need to ensure that our students feel secure in their daily educational environment. The presence of an SRO will not only provide an immediate response to potential threats but also serve as a proactive deterrent, fostering a sense of security among our students, staff, and families. The SRO will perform crucial duties, including supervising drop-off times, ensuring exterior doors are secure, and monitoring hallways. Additionally, the SRO will be present at extracurricular events such as sports games, dances, and performances, providing a constant and reassuring presence. This role will also involve coordinating safety drills, working with law enforcement to conduct K-9 sweeps, and partnering with school leadership to ensure our safety protocols are up to date and effective.We believe this new addition will strengthen our ability to create a safe and welcoming environment for learning. The presence of an SRO is not just about addressing potential issues; it’s about preventing them and building trust between our schools and the community. We are excited to extend a warm Wildcat welcome to Detective Vincent R. Antinore as he joins Bright Local Schools. Detective Antinore, currently employed at the Highland County Sheriff’s Office for over 12 years, brings a wealth of experience and leadership to our district. As a supervisor with expertise in child crimes since 2018, he has undergone extensive training in areas critical to school safety, including child abuse, criminal investigations, active shooter scenarios, interviews, and de-escalation techniques. Detective Antinore and his family reside in the Bright Local School District. His commitment to protecting and serving our community aligns perfectly with our focus on student and staff safety. We are confident that Detective Antinore’s presence will be an invaluable asset as we continue to enhance our security measures at Bright Local Schools. Together, we will continue to prioritize safety while maintaining our commitment to academic excellence and the well-being of our Bright Local family.",
