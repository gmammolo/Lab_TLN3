  "text": "Wilmington College men's soccer achieves first regional ranking since 2022 The United Soccer Coaches (USC) announced their second Region VII (Seven) rankings of the 2024 season Tuesday, and for the first time since 2022, the Wilmington College Quakers are ranked. Wilmington slots in at No. 7 after beginning their season 4-0-3 and tying their win total from last season. Two Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) schools are ahead of Wilmington in the rankings in Ohio Northern University (No. 2) and John Carroll University (No. 3). Both those schools are ranked nationally, as the Polar Bears sit at No. 15 and the Blue Streaks are at No. 23. The Quakers are the final team that is undefeated in the OAC, as they continue to play solid soccer. Freshman Parker Burke has 15 points this season with six goals and three assists, which already ties the Quakers top point scorer from 2023. Randy Harris has 11 points with four goals and three assists, which bests the Quakers second highest point scorer from a season ago. Wilmington looks to keep their undefeated season alive Saturday night in the Quaker Bowl against the Earlham College Quakers on homecoming weekend at 7 p.m. Wilmington bested Earlham in this matchup last season, 1-0.
