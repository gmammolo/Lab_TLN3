  "text": "Everybody say “Yeah!” Stevie Wonder is coming to Greensboro next month. The legendary musician announced on Thursday a mini-tour that will include a stop at the Greensboro Coliseum on Oct. 17. Tickets go on sale Friday at noon through Ticketmaster. The concerts are being marketed as a call for joy, kindness and peace during a contentious election season. Titled “Sing Your Song! As We Fix Our Nation’s Broken Heart,” the 10-date tour will include performances in several swing states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin as well as the concert in Greensboro. Wonder, 74, performed “Higher Ground” at the Democratic National Convention in August. A 25-time Grammy winner, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee and one of the pillars of American popular music, Wonder has a few noteworthy connections with Winston-Salem. People are also reading… Clarence Paul, a Winston-Salem native, was among Wonder’s earliest mentors while working as an executive with Motown Records in Detroit. Paul co-wrote Wonder’s first big hit, “Fingertips (Parts I and II),” and produced much of his early work. Paul can be seen directing Wonder’s band in a performance of “Fingertips” on YouTube. Paul was born Clarence Pauling, eventually dropping the last three letters of his last name to avoid confusion with his brother, Lowman Pauling, who was the guitarist and main songwriter for the “5” Royales, a local R&B group that was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. In 1973, Wonder spent 15 days at Baptist Hospital recovering from a crash that nearly killed him. Wonder, then 23, was riding in a car on Interstate 85 near Salisbury when it crashed into the back of a logging truck. Well-wishers, including Paul McCartney, flooded the hospital’s switchboard, hoping to pass along messages to the injured Wonder. John Lennon and Yoko Ono sent flowers. Dr. Courtland Davis performed life-saving surgery on Wonder, who was at the peak of his career, having just released his masterpiece, “Innervisions,” days before the wreck. In an interview in 1974 after a concert in Greensboro, Wonder said he “was very, very close to death — even closer than anybody knew about.” Wonder was back on the road in five months. In ensuing concert stops in the state, he frequently mentioned the care he received while at Baptist, and even sent a card to Davis when he turned 60. 336-727-7420 @lisaodonnellWSJ",
