  "text": "Super Eagles forward, Victor Boniface was in action as Bayer Leverkusen commenced their Champions League campaign on a winning note, beating Feyenoord 4-0 on Thursday. The Nigerian international who was making his first appearance in the competition, gave a good account of himself. He was substituted in the 63rd minute for Patrik Schick. His Nigerian compatriot Tella was on the bench for the entire 90 minutes of the game. It was a poor start to the match for the Rotterdammers as they went a goal down in the fifth minute. Ramiz Zerrouki lost the ball in the midfield, which was punished by Florian Wirtz, who hit it low and hard into the bottom corner. Read Also: Wright Thumbs Up Aina’s Display Vs Liverpool Leverkusen’s second goal came in the 30th minute. Boniface powered past two Feyenoord players before playing a skillful no-look pass to Dutch international Jeremie Frimpong, whose low cross found the team’s other wing back, Alejandro Grimaldo, at the far post. The Spanish fullback only had to tap it home to make it 0-2. Six minutes later, it was 0-3. A counterattack gave Frimpong the space to get his second assist as he played an inch-perfect cross to Wirtz, who side-footed it home with ease. A free kick from Grimaldo was sent to the far post, where Edmond Tapsoba headed it back across and saw it go in via some poor goalkeeping from Timon Wellenreuther. Got what it Takes?
