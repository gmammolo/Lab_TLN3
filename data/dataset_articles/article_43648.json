  "text": "BRATTLEBORO — The Estey Organ Museum and Brattleboro Historical Society are partnering to host \"EsteyFest,\" a multi-day festival that includes the biennial gathering of the International Reed Organ Society.\nBetween Sept. 26 and 30, more than 100 organists and organ enthusiasts from around the world will gather in Brattleboro for workshops, lectures, field trips, and musical events. The festival will include public concerts on Sept. 28 and 29, special visiting hours at the Estey Organ Museum and Brattleboro Historical Society, and the opportunity to acquire an antique Estey Organ and be guided through the restoration process.\nFor over a century, the Estey Organ Company of Brattleboro brought music to parlors, churches, lodges, and communities around the world. Thanks to this year's EsteyFest, the public is invited to a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience a variety of performances at Epsilon Spires that will showcase some of the finest musical instruments built in Brattleboro, in the hands of masters from every corner of North America.\nAt 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 28, Boston's acclaimed Arpeggione Ensemble will lend a spooky touch to the festivities, bringing to life the original score of F.W. Murnau's cult-classic silent film of 1922, \"Nosferatu: a Symphony of Horrors.\" Arpeggione's 10-piece chamber orchestra will create an authentic cinema experience, performing on instruments of the period including a prominently featured 1920s Estey reed organ. Seating is limited for this event and purchasing advance tickets at epsilonspires.org is highly recommended.\nFree concerts on Sunday On Sept. 29, renowned scholar and keyboardist Artis Wodehouse will perform contemporary music at 1:30 p.m. specially adapted for Estey reed organs. Wodehouse's program includes the world premiere of a new harmonium sonata composed by Michael Calabris (b.1984), idiomatically suited to the Estey \"Z56 Artist's Model\" from 1919 on which she'll perform.\nA special Festival Concert at 3 p.m. presents a once-in-a-lifetime chance to hear Estey's best instruments in the hands of masters from every corner of North America, all gathered in Brattleboro for EsteyFest24. Instruments featured will include two newly restored organs from the Estey Organ Museum collection: a rare 1874 \"Double Bank\" organ with two full keyboards, and a very grand 1925 Chapel Organ; as well as two organs from private collections: a \"Philharmonic\" from 1892 (one of the largest single-keyboard reed organs ever built), and a musically exquisite \"Artist's Model\" from 1919. Six organists from the International Reed Organ Society will perform a variety of repertoire written or arranged for reed organs. They will showcase several of Estey's top-of-the-line instruments from various periods of the company's history. The concert organs are on loan from the Estey Organ Museum and private collections.\nThe day of music will conclude at 7 p.m. with celebrated organist Susan Ferré who will present a recital of \"Music in the Ste. Clotilde Tradition\" on the Estey pipe organ. Ferré studied and worked at Ste. Clotilde with organist and composer Jean Langlais. She will perform works from the same 100-year-old period that Estey built organs in the United States. Through the music of César Franck, Theodore Dubois, Charles Tournemire, and Jean Langlais, Ferré will showcase the subtlety and power of the Estey pipe organ.\nBrattleboro Community Television will be live broadcasting the Artis Wodehouse Talk and the Festival Concert on Sunday at brattleborotv.org/live/events , BCTV's YouTube channel, Facebook page, and on local Comcast channel 1078.\nIn addition to all the concerts, EsteyFest also offers the opportunity to fix up that old pump organ sitting around. Expert organ restorer Allen Myers will conduct a workshop at the Estey Organ Museum on Sept. 28 entitled \"Take Apart a Reed Organ.\" The program is designed to get the project underway. Simple tools, a mechanical mind, and some spare time is all that is needed. Participants will receive a written manual and ongoing support. For those without a reed organ, the EOM and BHS will provide a restorable organ for free from their storeroom of antique organs that are seeking new homes. For more information, contact Allen Myers directly at: mudfog.reedorgan@gmail.com .\nIn addition to manufacturing reed organs, the Estey Organ Company designed and built pipe organs in the early 20th century. One of the company's finest extant examples of the 3,000 pipe organs was designed for Brattleboro's First Baptist Church (now Epsilon Spires,) where the Estey family worshipped for generations.\nBetween 1852 and 1960, Estey manufactured over half a million organs, making history as the most prolific organ builder of all time. Many companies across America manufactured reed organs (also called pump organs or harmoniums) at the turn of the last century, but Estey's organs stood out for their quality.\nFor more information about EsteyFest, visit esteyorganmuseum.org . The Estey Organ Museum is located at 108 Birge Street on the site of the historic Estey factory in Brattleboro and is open seasonally on Saturdays or by appointment.",
