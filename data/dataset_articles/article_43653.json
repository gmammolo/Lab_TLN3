  "text": "MaineDOT begins accessibility work in Boothbay Harbor Maine Department of Transportation (MaineDOT) started work Sept. 17 in downtown Boothbay Harbor, causing some complications for both foot and car traffic. The project aims to make the town compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. Mathieu Cutler, a MaineDOT representative on site, said over a handful of sites are planned for Boothbay Harbor. He said the work is focused along Route 27, which is managed by the state, and will not take place on side streets; sites include on Oak Street, Todd Avenue, Union Street and by the library. The work is part of an item in MaineDOT’s three-year plan to make $750,000 of ADA improvements in Boothbay Harbor, Camden and Rockport. Cutler said the entire contract for all three towns is over Nov. 1. According to Cutler, the work in Boothbay Harbor will only be at crosswalks to smooth slopes, reduce tripping hazards and, in some places, add signs. Overall, he said the goal is to make the areas safer for people with disabilities such as the blind or those in wheelchairs. Town Manager Julia Latter said she inspected several sites with MaineDOT last year when it informed the town what needed to be done for ADA rules. However, the timing of this work was a surprise to both the town and local businesses. “We couldn't have let (businesses) know beforehand,” she said. “We don't know when the state is going to do their work.” The work also involves tearing up sections of downtown sidewalk bricks, some of which were recently installed as part of the town’s sidewalk rehabilitation project. Cutler said MaineDOT will be covering the cost of repairing the altered sections, but they would likely be concrete to match ADA requirements. Despite some disruptions, Latter said the MaineDOT project is a good thing. She said there are many reasons for it including hazard mitigation and safety. “I’m thankful they are making our town ADA compliant.”",
