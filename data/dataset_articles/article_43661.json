  "text": "Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute Receives Accreditation From Association of Zoos and Aquariums The Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI) has been awarded a five-year accreditation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Widely regarded as the “gold standard” of zoological accreditation, AZA accreditation certifies the Zoo has met or exceeded AZA’s rigorous standards for animal care, veterinary programs, conservation, education and safety. “I am incredibly proud of our dedicated, passionate team who demonstrates daily their commitment to our mission,” said Brandie Smith, the John and Adrienne Mars Director of NZCBI. “AZA’s support of the zoo community is critical to advancing and evolving all aspects of animal care and management. We’ll build upon this milestone and continue to inspire visitors, train the next generation of zoo professionals and remain a global leader in cutting-edge research and conservation.” To remain a member of AZA, NZCBI must undergo a thorough investigation process every five years to ensure it meets the association’s continually rising standards. As part of this process, NZCBI submitted its protocols, facilities, operations, finances and research activities as well as had a five-day site inspection in May by leading zoo-industry experts. AZA inspectors review every aspect of a zoo’s operation—animal husbandry, veterinary, conservation and research programs, finances, education programs, public outreach, safety policies and procedures, security, physical facilities, guest services and the quality of the institution’s staff. The documents submitted by NZCBI, as well as the report filed by the AZA inspection team, were thoroughly evaluated by the AZA’s independent Accreditation Commission. A formal hearing was held during AZA’s Annual Conference with top NZCBI officials, and accreditation was fully granted Sept. 16. “Earning AZA accreditation reflects excellence and unwavering dedication to the highest standards of animal care and conservation,” said Dan Ashe, president and chief executive officer at AZA. “We are proud to count the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute as an accredited member. This incredible facility models our vision for a modern zoo, with engaging, inspiring, and educational exhibits that are linked to powerful wildlife conservation programs.” NZCBI leads the Smithsonian’s global effort to save species, better understand ecosystems and train future generations of conservationists. Its two campuses are home to some of the world’s most critically endangered species. Always free of charge, the Zoo’s 163-acre park in the heart of Washington, D.C., features 2,100 animals representing 400 species and is a popular destination for children and families. At the Conservation Biology Institute’s 3,200-acre campus in Virginia, breeding and veterinary research on 250 animals representing 20 species provide critical data for the management of animals in human care and valuable insights for conservation of wild populations. NZCBI’s more than 300 staff and scientists work in Washington, D.C., Virginia and with partners at field sites across the United States and in more than 30 countries to save wildlife, collaborate with communities and conserve native habitats. NZCBI is a long-standing accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.
