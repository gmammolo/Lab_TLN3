  "text": "A new Rouses Market opened in Picayune yesterday, introducing a 40,000-square-foot supermarket at 1701 Highway 43 North in the River Ridge Shopping Center. This location is the fourth Rouses store in Mississippi, with a fifth planned for Biloxi in October.\nRouses Markets purchased the River Ridge Shopping Center in 2022, bringing the store closer to Picayune and Pearl River County residents who previously traveled to Slidell for shopping. CEO Donny Rouse explained the decision to open the store.\n“We receive customer requests to build in their neighborhoods, but we can only open a few stores yearly. Our customers in Picayune and Pearl River County have been shopping with us in Slidell, so we wanted to offer a closer option,” Rouse said.\nThe store will employ up to 150 people, offering full—and part-time positions. Departments include a full-service seafood section, butcher shop with in-house steak aging, bakery, deli, hot food options, sushi, poke bowls, and a Mongolian grill. The store also offers online shopping and curbside pickup.\nRouse acknowledged the role of local government in the store’s development and thanked Picayune Mayor Jim Luke for his involvement.\n“I want to thank Mayor Jim Luke for his support throughout the process,” Rouse said.\nMayor Luke commented on the economic impact of the new store.\n“This new store provides 150 jobs and adds to our local economy. It also offers a new grocery option for our residents,” said Luke.\nCouncilwoman Ana Turnage, who represents the district where the store is located, noted the potential economic benefits.\n“Hiring this many people may encourage them to shop locally and possibly settle in Picayune, further boosting the community. It’s also an additional shopping option for our citizens,” said Turnage.",
