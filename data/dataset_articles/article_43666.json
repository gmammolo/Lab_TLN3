  "text": "Help Coach Doe and Family with new beginnings\nDonation protected\nFor over 10 years, Coach Doe has dedicated his life to the community, volunteering as a coach and mentor to countless young athletes. His unwavering commitment to helping others grow both on and off the field has shaped the lives of so many. But now, Coach Doe needs our help.\nRecently, tragedy struck when a fire destroyed his home, leaving him and his family with nothing. Despite this heartbreaking setback, Coach remains focused on staying strong for his family and community, just as he always has.\nNow it’s our turn to give back. We are seeking donations to help Coach Doe and his family get back on their feet during this difficult time. Any support—whether financial or simply sharing this campaign—will go a long way in helping them rebuild their lives.\nLet’s come together, just as Coach Doe has done for so many of us, and assist him and his family in creating a new beginning. Thank you for your kindness and generosity.\nDonations\nOrganizer\nSavanah Martin\nOrganizer\nSchenectady, NY",
