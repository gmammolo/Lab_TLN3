  "text": "By BringMeTheNews ,\n10 hours ago The AMBER Alert for 7-year-old Brynlee Nelson, of Zimmerman, has been canceled after she was found safe early Thursday.\n“Great news. She has been found. Safe. Thank you to everyone who helped. More info to come,” the Sherburne County Sheriff’s Office said around 1:30 a.m.\nThe Minnesota BCA says a suspect is in custody.\nThe alarming situation began Wednesday night when a Facebook post shared by law enforcement agencies said Brynlee didn't get off the bus earlier on Wednesday, and her parents could not locate her.\nShe had last been seen on the 26000 block of 13th Street West at 3:55 p.m. .\nThe Zimmerman/Livonia Fire Department posted about the child at 8:03 p.m., saying people were canvassing the area. Authorites asked anyone who lives between Caseys and the Zimmerman Home and Garden store to check outbuildings, campers, ice castles, and doorbell cameras.\nThe AMBER Alert was issued around 11:45 p.m.\nThe Sherburne County Sheriff's Office also shared an apparent surveillance video snapshot of the Brynlee dressed in winter gear from earlier in the day.\nWhat the missing child from Zimmerman was last seen wearing.
