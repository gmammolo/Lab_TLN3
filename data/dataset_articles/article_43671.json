  "text": "schools resumed in July 2024, Mangaldan, Pangasinan has faced over 10 days of class suspensions because of bad weather. To help students catch up, Mangaldan National High School will hold remedial classes.\nDanilo Eden, the assistant principal, said each teacher will focus on helping students who need extra support.\n\"Ang bawat teacher ay nag re-remedial sa mga estudyante na nila kailangan na kasi,\" Eden said.\nStudents have responded positively, recognizing the importance of catching up on lessons missed before the upcoming first quarter exams.\n\"Para makahabol na rin po kami, andami naming naiwan na activities,\" Crisanto Martinez, a student, said.\nThe remedial classes will last between 30 minutes to an hour.\nThe school administration is also considering the possibility of make-up classes and will inform parents, students, and teachers about any updates.\n\"Need namin i-inform muna ang mga magulang, learners at lalo na ang mga teacher kasi sila ang nakakaalam ng mga lessons,\" Eden said.\nDuring the class suspensions, the Department of Education (DepEd) implemented modular learning to ensure students could continue their studies from home.",
