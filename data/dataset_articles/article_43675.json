  "text": "By Mike Moraitis ,\n1 hours ago\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers need all the help they can get on the offensive side of the ball after a slow start to the season, and they may get at least one reinforcement in Week 3.\nAccording to the team's injury report on Thursday , rookie wide receiver Roman Wilson logged a full practice, which was an upgrade from Wednesday when he was limited. This is the second full practice for Wilson since the season began.\nOf course, we know the full practice doesn't guarantee that Wilson will play, as he logged one full session on Thursday last week before he was limited on Friday and was ultimately ruled out. Fingers crossed that won't be the case this time, though.\nWilson suffered an ankle injury in late July, which forced him to miss a ton of training camp, all of the preseason and the first two games of the regular season.\nBefore suffering the injury, Wilson appeared to be making inroads to landing himself a role early on in the season, as he was having a strong camp. However, he's unlikely to do much if he does make his debut in Week 3, as he's missed a ton of practice time.\nThe hope is that Wilson will eventually take the slot role, a job that currently belongs to Calvin Austin, who isn't doing much to secure it. In fairness to Austin, nobody on the Steelers is doing much through the air, and his snaps have been limited with the Steelers utilizing multiple tight ends often.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
