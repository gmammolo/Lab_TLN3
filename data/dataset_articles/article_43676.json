The fall equinox is a time where the energies of light and dark are held in balance as the length of day and night are perfectly equal. Following the equinox, the days continue to grow shorter and give way to longer nights, marking the start of our slow descent into winter in the Northern Hemisphere. The days continue to shorten until the winter solstice in December. Aside from being a cyclical seasonal and astrological shift, the fall equinox on September 22 also has a strong practical and spiritual significance. By deepening our awareness of these seasonal energies and planetary shifts, we are connecting to something larger. We are plugging into the inherent wisdom of the Earth. We can utilize that connection in our self-care and spiritual practices. One of the biggest themes for this time of year is balance. Although we may strive for balance throughout the year, how often do we give ourselves a chance to deeply reflect on this idea and how it plays out in everyday life? Consider where you intuitively feel out of balance and ponder ways to bring yourself back to the center. What’s the balance between giving and receiving in your life? How about creating and allowing? If possible, avoid acting on the urge to jump right into fixing and more doing. The energy of this time of year is quieter and less assertive. See if you can embrace surrender, grace, and trust. Allow yourself the time to take in what has already transpired this year. After this equinox, the energies of Earth are turning inward toward rest and respite. Prioritizing slowness and self-care is what we are being asked. The fall equinox yoga practice that follows takes a soothing approach to honoring the balance of light and dark. It helps you integrate your left and right side bodies, each of which contain different energies, through active balancing poses and restorative twists. Also, hip openers help you release tension so you can slow down and honor the annual turn toward rest and regeneration. A Fall Equinox Yoga Practice To Help You Feel Balanced I suggest some comfy clothes, soothing lighting, and perhaps a blanket or two in case you crave some extra cushioning or warmth during your fall equinox yoga practice. Alternate Nostril Breathing (Nadi Shodhana) Alternate nostril breathing ( Nadi Shodhana ) is believed to help create a soothing equanimity between the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Start in a comfortable seated position. Rest your right index finger and two middle fingers against your palm. Using your thumb, close your right nostril and inhale deeply through your left nostril. Then using your right ring finger, close your left nostril. Release your thumb from your right nostril and slowly exhale through your right nostril. When you’re ready, inhale through your right nostril and then exhale through your left nostril. Inhale through your left nostril and exhale through your right nostril. Continue for 5 rounds, taking your time and breathing intentionally. Child’s Pose (Balasana) From your seat, keep your knees bent as you release your legs behind you and come to sit on your heels. Separate your knees as wide as feels comfortable and then release your belly toward the floor as you extend your arms alongside your legs, palms up, or in front of you, palms down in Child’s Pose . Breathe fully and feel your side body lengthen and your shoulders release with each breath. Stay here for 5 breaths. Child’s Pose With a Side Stretch If your arms are alongside your body, reach them toward the front of the mat. Release your shoulders. Walk your palms over to the right side of your mat to give your right side body a stretch. Rest your forehead on the mat and breathe into your left side body. Keep your left shoulder relaxed and releasing toward the mat. Stay here for 5 breaths. Return to center and pause here for a few breaths. When you’re ready, repeat on the other side. Low Lunge (Anjaneyasana) From Child’s Pose, slowly lift yourself to hands and knees. Step your right foot forward and inch your left knee closer to the back of the mat until you feel as stretch along the front of your left hip and thigh in Low Lunge . Tuck a folded blanket beneath your back knee if you need cushioning. Sink into your hips as you also lift through your chest. Draw your right outer hip back a little and hug your inner thighs toward one another for steadiness. Stay here or reach both hands toward the ceiling and bring your palms together overhead in prayer position. Exhale as you lean your hands and upper body toward the right as you stretch your left side. Stay here for 5 breaths. As you inhale, return to center. As you exhale, lean toward the left and remain there for 5 breaths. Inhale as you come back to center. Slowly return to hands and knees and repeat on the left side. Pigeon Pose (Eka Pada Rajakapotasana) From hands and knees, bring your right knee toward your right wrist, and your right ankle toward your left wrist. Extend your left leg straight behind you and sink your hips toward the mat. Lower your chest toward the mat and rest your forehead or forearms on the mat or blocks in Pigeon Pose . Soften any gripping you might feel in your hips and stay here for 5 breaths. Lift your chest slightly reach your right arm across your chest and under your left bicep, as you would in Thread the Needle, for a twisted Pigeon. Rest your forehead on the mat or turn to gaze at your right hand. Stay here for 5 breaths. Take a few breaths to slowly unwind before you repeat on the other side. Seated Spinal Twist (Marichyasana C) Find a seated position. Extend your left leg straight in front of you. Draw your right knee toward your chest and place the bottom of your right foot on the floor. Sit up tall and try to lift your waist away from your hips. Open your chest toward your right, bringing your right hand behind you for support like a kickstand. Wrap your left arm around your right knee and slowly turn toward the right in Marichi’s Pose . Turn your gaze over your right shoulder. Stay here for 5 breaths. Slowly unwind to center and repeat on the other side. Reclined Spinal Twist (Supta Matsyendrasana) Lie on your back and bring either your right knee or both knees toward your chest, wrapping your hands around your shin. Extend both arms straight out from the shoulders and lower your right knee or both knees across your body toward the left. Pause wherever your body needs you to. Gaze toward your right fingertips or close your eyes. Release your shoulders into the mat and stay here for 5 slow breaths. Slowly unwind and bring your knee(s) back toward your chest. Repeat on the other side. Savasana (Corpse Pose) Extend yourself long on the mat, perhaps taking a couple rolled blankets beneath your knees to release tension in your lower back or hamstrings. Release your arms by your sides, palms facing up, and let your feet fall away from one another. Let yourself be heavy and release any hold you had on your breath. Stay still with your breath for 4-10 minutes. When you’re ready, slowly start to lengthen your breath, slowly make your way back to seated following your fall equinox yoga practice, and ease back into your day or night.
