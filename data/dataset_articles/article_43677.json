  "text": "Your yoga mat is such an essential part of your practice—it’s literally your support system and bonded bestie, all rolled into one. That means finding—and investing in—the mat that’s correct for you is a serious consideration. One YJ editor- and teacher-approved contender is Manduka’s PROlite Yoga Mat and it’s currently on sale in an array of bright colors.\nMy first Manduka Prolite mat was stolen from my car and I hope it’s still living its best life somewhere out there. Our time together was brief but full of the sort of support that made any yoga class doable—even for a (then) newbie like me.\nAlthough the seriously durable classic Manduka PRO (6mm thick) is what many yoga teachers consider their go-to, I found the PROlite (4.7 mm thick) the perfect thickness and weight for toting to and from class. The PROlite stays in my trunk, where its always at the ready for a spontaneous drop-in, whereas my PRO lives in my living room. (The PRO is durable enough that is may outlive us all. But it’s also heavy.)\nManduka PROlite Yoga Mat for $81 ( $108 )\nWhen you buy through our links, we may earn an affiliate commission. This supports our mission to get more people on their mats. Learn more .\nThe PROlite’s thinner build means less cushioning, which may be a deal-breaker for some, but certain fan-fave Manduka qualities, like the no-slip dot pattern on the bottom of the mat, remain. Expect a wrinkle-free, no-slide experience, no matter how quickly you transition between poses. Yoga Journal editors and friends have noted that all Manduka mats require a bit of time to break in but that the extra effort is well worth it. The PROlite also comes with Manduka’s lifetime guarantee.*\nPlayful colors like Passion Berry, Vulcan, Ray, Eden, and Galilee are included in the sale.\n* Should your mat peel, flake, or fade, Manduka promises a replacement.",
