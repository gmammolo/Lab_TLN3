  "text": "Solsma’s Punkin Patch marks 25 years of operation\nSome folks may like to keep up Christmas decorations for as long as possible. For Amy Solsma, it’s fall decor all year round.\nThat may have something to do with owning and operating Solsma’s Punkin Patch near Sanborn for the past 25 years.\nAnd that’s something they’ll be celebrating all season long.\n“I decided that instead of just celebrating one day, why not do a month? You never know what the weather’s going to do,” Solsma said. “So we’re having a few events starting Sept. 21 with free face painting and some wine tasting with Hidden Vineyard. In addition to our regular activities we’ll start having food trucks that weekend as well. On Sept. 28 we’ll have car cruise-in, then Oct. 5 we’ll have the Great Punkin Smash. People that visit that day can sign up and if they’re chosen they get to smash a pumpkin with a prize inside. And then Oct. 12 we’ll have a pumpkin decorating contest that will be a lot of fun.”\nFun is something families have been able to have at Solsma’s for many years, and it’s something Amy looks forward to each autumn.\n“It’s hard to comprehend that I’ve been doing this that long, but it’s true and we’ve got the pictures to prove it!” Solsma said. “I’m certainly proud of what we’ve done over the years and we’ve tried to add something fun every year, sometimes it’s big things and sometimes it’s little things but we keep it fresh and it’s always free to come out to the yard, which has always been important to me — making it affordable and family friendly.”\nSomething new this year is a break from their usual corn maze.\nSolsma said they don’t typically do designs but in celebration of their 25th year decided to give it a shot.\n“So I wrote out Solsma’s with a big pumpkin and XXV for 25 — it’s free hand and actually turned out really cool!” Solsma said.\nAs usual there are a few new varieties of pumpkins and gourds to see.\nIn the general store there is the always popular Ruby Red Popcorn and products from about 17 local consignors including at least one that has been on had every year the shop has been open.\nThere are plenty of visitors that come by the pumpkin patch every year as well.\n“It’s so cool to see kids that have grown up, and some have kids of their own now that they bring out too,” Solsma said. “It’s pretty special.”",
