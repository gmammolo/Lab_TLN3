  "text": "THE GLUE-GUY: Robinson the unsung puzzle piece of Willis' success in 2024\nTHE WILLIS WILDKAT FOOTBALL TEAM HAD A HISTORIC SEASON IN 2023, GOING UNDEFEATED IN THE REGULAR SEASON, WINNING DISTRICT AND GOING THREE ROUNDS DEEP IN THE POSTSEASON.\nOne of the unsung heroes of that team was athlete Daylion Robinson.\nThe 6-foot athlete didn’t leave the field much as a running back, receiver and defensive back.\n“To play both ways, you have to be a good athlete, well-conditioned and smart,” he said. “You have to be an overall team player because you won’t get as much shine at your primary position because you are spread all over the field. You have to know the concepts on both sides of the ball and know where everyone needs to be on the field.”\nD-Rob was the District Newcomer of the Year in 2022 as a sophomore. He accounted for over 750 yards of offense as a junior, as much of the offense went through Gatorade Player of the Year QB DJ Lagway.\n“I’ve seen a lot of players, like DJ, make it big,” he said. “I just know I can do it too. I’m looking forward to an opportunity in college, where the coaches love me. I love football, it’s fun to me and I want to find an environment that will fill that space. I can’t wait.”\nBradley C. Collier (\nThe bar has been set at Willis under the direction of coach Trent Miller, and now Robinson and company yearn to continue the success from a year ago.\n“It was a special year and a special team, but we want more this year,” he said. “We have worked so hard in the off-season and summer to keep this thing going. We want to come back strong and get to State.”\nRobinson will be looked to for more production as a senior and he welcomes the responsibility.\n“I want it to fall on me,”he said. “I lean to the offense just because I love scoring and making plays, but I like to play defense because my team needs me there. I’m pretty good at it.”\nFueled on his favorite snack of Hot Fries and chicken alfredo, Robinson loves to watch film of his favorite players Saquon Barkley (Philadelphia Eagles) and Jahmyr Gibbs (Detroit Lions), when he’s not working out or playing the game he loves.\n“Honestly, my best memories come from football,” he said. “I love being with my guys. Times like hanging at the hotel at the State 7-on-7 Tournament and team dinners. It’s has just been my life for so long.”",
