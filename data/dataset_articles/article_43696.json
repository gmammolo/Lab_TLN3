Daniel Stark Injury Lawyers hosted their 17th Annual Car Seat Safety Event to provide essential car seat inspections and distribute new child car seats at no cost to families who needed them. During the event, 113 car seat inspections were conducted but only one child was found to be a property-restrained seat. The statistic highlights the critical need for increased car seat safety awareness, said organizers. In total, Daniel Stark provided 93 new car seats to local families. Over 30 students from Bryan Collegiate High School volunteered to join Daniel Stark and Texas A&M AgriLife Extension during the event. “Proper use of child safety seats not only reduces medical costs but also prevents lost future earnings and improves a child’s quality of life following a collision,” said Daniel Stark Public Communications Director Linda McMillan.” According to Texas A&M AgriLife, the Bryan event had an estimated economic impact of $234,889.
