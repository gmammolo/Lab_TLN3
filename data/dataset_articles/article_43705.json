  "text": "By John Canady ,\n1 hours ago\nThe Brooklyn Nets have announced a date for the organization to honor one of the best athletes to wear a Nets jersey.\nThe Nets franchise has had some of the best basketball players in the game suit up for them. From their time in New Jersey to the transition to Brooklyn, the team has had the privilege of multiple superstars representing them on the court. Now, they’ll honor a future Hall of Famer during this upcoming season.\n“The Brooklyn Nets will retire Vince Carter’s jersey in a ceremony on Saturday, January 25, 2025, at Barclays Center,” HoopHype’s Michael Scotto reported on Thursday. “This is the seventh jersey retirement in franchise history, joining Dražen Petrović, Jason Kidd, John Williamson, Bill Melchionni, Julius Erving, and Buck Williams”\nCarter was selected with the No. 5 overall pick in the 1998 NBA Draft. The versatile guard spent seven seasons with the Toronto Raptors before being dealt to the Nets in a blockbuster trade in 2004. During his five-year tenure in New Jersey, Carter averaged 23.6 points, 5.8 rebounds and 4.7 assists through 374 games.\nDuring his time there, the former Top-5 pick led the team to three playoff berths and two Eastern Conference Semifinals appearances.\nThe ceremony for Carter will be the second of the season as the Raptors also have honored the former star with their new City Edition jerseys.\nMore NBA: Lakers legend Shaquille O'Neill sounds off on Timberwolves' Rudy Gobert as beef continues\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
