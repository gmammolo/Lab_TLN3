  "text": "The fundraiser with the long title and the long list of noted South Bay chefs is returning on Sunday, Sept. 29.\n“Star Chefs and the Wines & Spirits They Love” will feature gourmet bites paired with cocktails, wines or brews — all to benefit this year’s nonprofit recipient, Momentum for Health, which offers behavioral care for adults in Santa Clara County. The event’s being held this year in Saratoga.\nThe participating chefs will be Peter Armellino (Plumed Horse), Jeffrey Stout (Orchard City Kitchen, Be.Steak.A), Jackie Jackson (Jackie’s Place), Ross Hanson (Oak & Rye), Ricky Nguyen (The Bywater), Jacob Farleigh (Silos), Marcelo Hernandez (Asa Los Gatos), Jonathan Toste (Flowers), Jose Mendoza (Hero Ranch Kitchen) and Patrick Capurro (Be.Steak.A).\nEach chef will prepare an appetizer and present it with a complementary beverage — wine, beer or a specially crafted cocktail.\nBeverage partners for the event are Testarossa Winery, Grgich Hills, The Prisoner Wine Co., Brassfield Estate Winery, Joyce Vineyards, Remy Cointreau, No. 3 London Dry Gin, Narrative Fermentations and Sante Adairius Rustic Ales.\nStar Chefs will run from 3 to 7 p.m. at a private Saratoga residence. Tickets, $150 each or $250 for a pair at https://momentumforhealth.org/starchefs/ .",
