  "text": "The holiday season brings with it Halloween festivities, a period of thanks, and Christmas cheer, along with new films and TV shows. The anticipation for Blockbuster movies builds up throughout the duration. “As we entered 2024, there had been much agonizing from theater owners and movie executives as to the future of cinema,” Steve Cypert, a local moviemaker, said. “Many people held their collective breaths and kept their fingers crossed. Would people still go to see movies in the theater? The answer didn't come until July and August. Out came ‘Inside Out 2,’ ‘Deadpool & Wolverine,’ ‘Despicable Me 4’, ‘Dune: Part Two,’ ‘Twisters,’ then finally, this September, ‘Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.’ Theater owners could breathe easy again. People love going to the movies.” Christopher Coursey, a Cherokee County film director and producer, said he is looking forward to watching some movies that have already come out. Some of them are “Alien: Romulus,” released in August; “Deadpool & Wolverine,” from late July; and the “Beetlejuice” sequel, called “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,” which was released in early September. Coursey said it has been a while since he has noticed a classic Christmas movie make an appearance on the big screens, but he has observed a lot of superhero and scary or thriller films showing up lately. “Some of it, I think, has to do with the [SAG-AFTRA] strike that went on last year, and it sort of put things behind,” Coursey siad. “It’ll probably be a year or so before things finally get back going, with all the writers who were on strike for that.” The SAG-AFTRA strikes are also why Coursey said movies sure to be hits, such as superhero films, are coming out in droves. Jeremy Scott, another local filmmaker, said he has not noticed any upcoming movies he believes will be especially good, other than “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,” but he is looking forward to some TV shows. “The Penguin,” a TV mini-series on HBO following the events of the 2022 “The Batman,” is one Scott is hoping to see. Scott is also waiting for the next season of “The Last of Us” and the new “Daredevil: Born Again,” both of which will premiere in 2025. “Star Wars: Skeleton Crew” is another TV show, set to be released in December, that Scott is hoping to check out. Scott said he believes TV shows have been in a \"golden age\" for a while, and that will eventually start to drop off in quality. But he recently has been having a hard time finding interesting shows. “Right now, I think as far as the shows on TV, I’m struggling to find something that’s just captivating me to the point where I can’t wait for the next season,” Scott said. Cypert said October will be filled with drama and thriller movies, including a musical, “Joker: Folie à Deux”; “Venom: The Last Dance”; and “Conclave.” Cypert said the action/drama movie “Gladiator II” will debut in November. “What's Santa bringing? Well. There's ‘Kraven the Hunter’ and’ The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim.’ Will one of those be a lump of coal? We'll see,” Cypert said. Cypert said the “odd” film he will be attending later this month is “Megalopolis,” a sci–fi/drama set to an architect rebuilding a utopia-like New York City after a disaster. Horror fans will have a slew of films to pick from, including “Bagman” in September. The month of spookiness, October, will feature “Things Will Be Different,” “The Unraveling,” “Terrifier 3,” and “Smile 2.” Cypert said November will also offer a horror genre movie called “Heretic.” Children’s films this year will feature a lot of animation, including September’s picks of “Transformers One” and “The Wild Robot.” Cypert said October’s movies made for kids will include “Piece by Piece,” “My Hero Academia: You’re Next,” and “Kensuke’s Kingdom.” “Moana 2” is what Cypert said will probably be a blowout in November, with “Hitpig” and “Overload: The Sacred Kingdom” to also make an appearance in theaters. “There are plenty of other genre films coming as well – drama, thriller, comedy, and documentary, you name it: ‘How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies,’ ‘The Substance,’ ‘What We Find on the Road,’ ‘Man vs. Phone,’ ‘Empire Waist,’ ‘She Taught Love,’ ‘White Bird,’ ‘The Forest Hills,’ ‘Detour 95,’ ‘Blitz,’ ‘A Real Pain,’ ‘Love Bomb,’ ‘Christmas Eve in Miller's Point,’ ‘Wicked,’ ‘Bonhoeffer: Pastor,’ ‘Spy,’ and ‘Assassin,’” Cypert said. “Best be saving up for the popcorn. It's gonna be wild.”",
