  "text": "Simone Biles [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/simone-arianne-biles/]‘ athletic influence has just gained her another acknowledgment. Biles made it to the recently released list of the most influential sports personalities from all across the globe by Sports Illustrated. As she returned with all the grace to the mat after the Tokyo setback, it appears that she will claim glory in every way possible. To prove her worth, she has gained a position that has not been captured for more than 16 years. Biles’ journey reveals a fact: the fact that he has consistently pushed limits. Moreover, her impeccable achievements in the athletic realm count way more than her historic medal count or eponymous skills. In Sports Illustrated’s 2024 Power List, Biles once again earned her place as one of the most influential figures in sports—the first time it has happened for an American Olympian in the last 16 years. Her name has rightfully gained a seat alongside the names of several other legends of the sports realm. Reshaping the conversation and thoughts surrounding the mental well-being of athletes, Biles stepped back in her sport, going against all the backlash and criticism that came her way. A topic once whispered about in locker rooms is now openly discussed on the world’s biggest stages way more often than before.

Simone Biles of United States celebrates with her medals. REUTERS/Hannah Mckay After her brave decision to prioritize her mental health at the Tokyo Olympics, Biles returned stronger, both physically and emotionally. And competing as an olympian in gymnastics at the age of 27 and earning four medals, she showed the world that vulnerability is a form of strength. With 11 Olympic medals and with the total count for World Championships and Olympics standing at 41, Biles unapologetically admitted the fact that she doesn’t keep a count of her medals. With five skills on her name, she was brutally honest, as she stated, “I would have to google,” when asked about her medal count. Simone Biles, with an unparalleled list of achievements, now graces her throne alongside groundbreaking athletes. Biles is on the same page as NBA legend LeBron James, golf king Tiger Woods, former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, and others, proving that she is unquestionably the G.O.A.T. of her sport. Moreover, she solidified her place in the broader legacy of Olympic legends similar to Michael Phelps. Wonder how? HAS SIMONE BILES REACHED MICHAEL PHELPS’ LEGENDARY STATUS IN SPORTS HISTORY? It was the Beijing Olympics that saw Michael Phelps [https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/michael-phelps/] reach the zenith of his swimming career. With an unparalleled performance, it was after 2008 that Michael Phelps secured a spot in the power ranking list of Sports Illustrated. Phelps made it to the list just on the caliber of his Olympic performance. Since then, no other athlete has made it to the list as just an Olympian before Simone Biles, this year. [https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1624501452.jpg]BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA – AUGUST 18: Honoree Michael Phelps speaks onstage during the Harold & Carole Pump Foundation 2023 Gala at The Beverly Hilton on August 18, 2023 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Tiffany Rose/Getty Images for Harold & Carole Pump Foundation) While several NBA athletes have undoubtedly graced the Olympic stage, their names have been reflected on the list not solely because of their Olympic performance. Rather, it has been dependent upon the way they dominated their respective leagues. While Phelps left an indelible mark on swimming with his unmatched haul of 23 Olympic gold medals, Biles has carried the torch for gymnastics in her own right. Just as Beijing was Phelps’ land of dominance in 2008, Biles undoubtedly owned the City of Love as she won back-to-back four Olympic medals. This justifies the presence of her name in the list of the top fifty influential sportspersonas. Do you think Biles too has achieved the same level as that of Michael Phelps in her own realm?
