  "text": "KEREMEOS — Canada’s only hot pepper festival is back this weekend at Memorial Park in Keremeos. If you like your food spicy and enjoy good family fun, the annual Similkameen Sizzle Festival is back on Saturday, Sept. 21 and hotter than ever. This isn’t just any hot pepper festival, it’s Canada’s only hot pepper festival and it’s all going down in charming Keremeos. Organizers are telling anyone who might want to attend for the first time to not let the small-town vibes fool you, as the Similkameen Sizzle promises big flavours and even bigger fun. Attendees can shop till they drop at the Sizzle market, which will be selling artisanal goodies to the freshest produce from local agricultural lands. There will be plenty of live music all day and evening as there will be classic rocks bands performing throughout the day. The Kids’ Zone will keep the little ones happy with entertainment, games and a bouncy castle. The highlight of the festival will be the infamous “Sear Factor” Hot Pepper Eating Contest. Registration takes place throughout the day and you must be at least 18 years of age to sign up. For all the hot sauce maestros out there, the Hot Sauce Battle also returns. Sign-up forms for the hot sauce contest will be available on site. There will also be a licensed adult beverage area, where you can sip on local wines, beers and ciders.
