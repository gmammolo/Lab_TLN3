  "text": "Michelle Obama delighted shoppers at a Costco in Livermore, CA, by promoting her new healthy beverage, Plezi Fizz.\nA TikTok video shared on Tuesday captured the former first lady standing in front of a substantial display of the drinks, which were launched in March.\nCustomers gathered around Michelle and her bodyguard, eager to take photos, the DailyMail.com reported. Several photos were also posted to social media.\nMichelle Obama at my Costco today giving out samples pic.twitter.com/UgYgF8J6Jv\n— 𝕶𝖎𝖗𝖇𝖘 (@BasedKirby) September 18, 2024\n@shakeandstirco2024 Costco in livermore! #costcodeals ♬ original sound – Shake&Stir\nIn the 25-second video, Michelle Obama informed the audience that the beverage was healthy, calorie-free, and delicious. A Costco employee named Oscaldo told DailyMail.com that the event took place on Wednesday, during which Obama was promoting her new business.\nMichelle Obama serves as the co-founder and strategic partner of Plezi Nutrition. According to the brand’s website, she is guiding the company to become a leader in creating healthy food and beverage brands, the outlet reported.\nOn the company’s website, she noted in a statement: “We’re starting with a beverage because we know how much concern parents and pediatricians have about sugary drinks.”\nPlezi Fizz comes in three flavors: Lemon Lime Squeeze, Cherry Limeade and Strawberry Lemonade. They reportedly contain 70 percent less sugar than other leading fruit juices.\nEarlier this summer, the former first lady sent a gaslighting message to black Americans that voting in the November elections is “critical” to protecting their “freedom.”\n“Juneteenth is all about celebrating our collective freedom and fighting to protect it,” Obama said in a video posted on X.\n“Our power, our rights, and even our planet are on the ballot this year,” Obama said. “So, now is the time to think about how you’re going to make your voice heard in this election.”\nThe desperate message comes as recent polling shows that former President Donald Trump may be on the verge of capturing a historic number of votes from black Americans.\nThe former first lady established the voter registration and engagement organization “When We All Vote” in 2018, and pushed her 22 million followers on X to visit the group’s website.\n“Get yourself registered to vote, and then text three friends to do the same,” she said. “Do not sit on the sidelines this year, because this is a critical moment for all of us.”\nWATCH:\nOn Juneteenth, we celebrate our freedom, our resilience, and our progress. Today we’re honoring all the Black folks who came before us – who helped build our country with their bare hands – who marched and fought to do everything they could to build a better future for us all.… pic.twitter.com/NmdjgcUK3t\n— Michelle Obama (@MichelleObama) June 19, 2024\nDuring a January interview on Jay Shetty’s “On Purpose” podcast, Obama put out another over-the-top call to action, claiming she was “terrified about what could possibly happen” in the election.\n“Because our leaders matter,” she then said. “Who we select, who speaks for us, who holds that bully pulpit — it affects us in ways that sometimes I think people take for granted.”\nIn March, Obama’s office confirmed again that she “will not be running for president,” as many had speculated she would amid disturbingly low poll numbers for Biden.\n“As former first lady Michelle Obama has expressed several times over the years, she will not be running for president,” Crystal Carson, director of communications for Obama’s office, told NBC News at the time.\n“Mrs. Obama supports President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ re-election campaign,” she added.\nOthers continued to predict that the former first lady would eventually throw her hat into the ring, but that was before President Biden chose to end his reelection bid and essentially anoint Harris as his successor, which the Democratic Party officially did at its August convention.",
