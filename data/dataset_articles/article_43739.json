  "text": "Norma Dumont explains why UFC Noche was no different as Las Vegas unbeaten streak extended\nEXCLUSIVE: Norma Dumont grew her winning streak to five with a unanimous decision victory over Irene Aldana at UFC Noche and has never lost a fight in Las Vegas\nNorma Dumont walked away from UFC Noche victorious, continuing her streak to five in a row and advancing to a 12-2 record. Both fighters predicted an all-out war between two ranked UFC bantamweights, with the Brazillian and\n[Irene Aldana](/latest/irena-aldana) delivering on their pre-fight hype claims.\nThe event, also known as UFC 306, was designed to honor Mexican heritage and took place in Las Vegas at The Sphere. The UFC said that due to\n[high production costs](/sport/mma/137560/Dana-White-UFC-306-Sphere-Las-Vegas), the show would [become historic as a one-night-only event](/sport/mma/148843/joe-rogan-andrew-schulz-agreement).\nAfter the preliminary card headliner, all three judges awarded Dumont a 30-27. Dumont utilized her range and power to punch her way through the crowd favorite, but the fight was most notably marked by Aldana's eye injury, which was instantly labeled as \"\n[the worst cut in UFC history](/sport/mma/148716/ufc-star-suffers-worst-cut-in-history).\" [Irene Aldana shows off horrific eye injury after severe facial lacerations from UFC 306](/sport/mma/148884/irene-aldana-shows-off-horrific) [Jake Paul sneaks into UFC 306 undercover after being banned by Dana White](/sport/mma/148800/jake-paul-ufc-306-disguise-ban-dana-white)\nBefore\n[UFC Noche](/sport/mma/148715/ufc-306-results-in-full-omalley-dvalishvili), Dumont made headlines outside the octagon with her announcement of joining [OnlyFans](/latest/onlyfans). Some fans initially leaped to their own conclusions about the content she would be posting, but Dumont set the record straight, explaining that the platform was a way for her to connect with fans through her training and daily life.\n\"The first reaction was that people thought I was going to post more private content,\" Dumont explained to Express U.S Sports. \"But they soon understood that it was more about my daily life, my training, and the preparation that goes into my career.\"\nDumont admitted that her tireless schedule during a fight camp features two daily training sessions, with the cameras always rolling. She balances training and content creation with assistance from teammates who train at whichever gym she's at for the day.\nFor Dumont, joining OnlyFans wasn’t just a platform for interaction but a chance to showcase the work behind the scenes that often goes unseen. The UFC bantamweight exhibits harsh physical preparation that the average athlete wouldn't dare to try and unforgiving technical drills that shape her success on fight night.\nFans quickly followed the page with initial assumptions but were converted to eager-to-learn students from her insights and routines. \"People started following because they enjoyed my physical preparation workouts and technical routines,\" she admitted. Over time, her audience expanded, and Dumont used the platform to bridge the cage and her personal life, connecting the dots with nutrition and fitness as topics.\nUFC Noche also saw Dumont preserve her unbeaten streak in Las Vegas, where she has fought eight times and never tasted defeat. \"I think it's the best place for everyone. I feel totally at home here. I've already lived here, so I feel at home,\" she said.\nDON'T MISS\n[Georgia goes wild in streets after Merab Dvalishvili's Championship victory over Sean O'Malley](/sport/mma/148728/georgia-goes-wild-in-streets) [Jon Jones confirms UFC retirement plans after Stipe Miocic announcement](/sport/mma/148886/jon-jones-confirms-ufc-retirement) [Dana White receives rare gift from WWE legend at UFC 306 in Las Vegas Sphere](/sport/mma/148725/dana-white-ufc-receives-gift-wwe-legend)\nDespite the event honoring Mexican heritage and her facing a Mexican opponent on the\n[same night of a Canelo Alvarez boxing event](/sport/boxing/144312/canelo-alvarez-announces-next-fight-undisputed), Dumont felt just as at home in the city.\"I've never lost in Las Vegas, and I'm going to continue not to lose here. Even though the night is Mexican, Las Vegas is my home and I felt 100 percent comfortable.\"\nHer comfort in the city translated into another star performance inside the octagon. After the win, Dumont rose three slots in the official UFC bantamweight rankings, making her No. 5 worldwide.",
