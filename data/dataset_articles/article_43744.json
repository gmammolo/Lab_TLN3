  "text": "What, dear reader, was the greatest week of your life? Think back on that moment. Treasure its beautiful memory. Then THROW IT IN THE TRASH, because the [Portland Mercury](https://everout.com/portland/events/mercury-wing-week-2024/e185575/)[’s Wing Week](https://everout.com/portland/events/mercury-wing-week-2024/e185575/) is about to make every other week you’ve ever experienced look like GARBAGE. That’s right: From Monday, September 30 to Sunday, October 6, the Portland Mercury’s Wing Week returns—with creative, one-of-a-kind chicken wings available at 70 Portland locations! Even better? Each order of six delicious wings will only cost you a mere $8! Yes, it will be amazing—because the Mercury and our Wing Week partners at [Jim Beam](https://www.beamdistilling.com/) and the [Rose City Rollers](https://rosecityrollers.com/) wouldn’t have it any other way! [Check out pics and descriptions of this year’s delectable wings right here](https://everout.com/portland/events/mercury-wing-week-2024/e185575/)—and once you stop drooling, keep a few things in mind: TIP, AND TIP WELL! Wing Week’s a ton of fun—and making it happen takes a ton of work! Make sure everyone behind Wing Week—everyone working on the floor, in the kitchen, and behind the bar—knows how much you appreciate them. Wing Week couldn’t happen without ’em! WINGS... AND MORE! As subtly implied by the name “Wing Week,” wings ARE the focus of Wing Week. BUT! Each Wing Week location also has an amazing array of sides and drinks that are a perfect match for their wings! Don’t miss out! HAVE FUN! This is Portland’s biggest Wing Week ever—and it’s almost guaranteed that despite everyone’s best efforts, there’ll be lines, sell-outs, and more. So if one location is too crowded? Just come back another day, and in the meantime, [hit another Wing Week location](https://everout.com/portland/events/mercury-wing-week-2024/e185575/)! #MERCURYWINGWEEK The Mercury’s got you covered with Wing Week updates, reviews, and tips on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/portlandmercury/), as well as [Twitter,](https://twitter.com/portlandmercury?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/portlandmercury/?hl=en) (just search the #mercurywingweek hashtag for loads of up-to-the-second info, and don't forget to tag yourself enjoying those... mmmm... wings). And on the [WING WEEK homepage](https://everout.com/portland/events/mercury-wing-week-2024/e185575/), you’ll find useful stuff like[ a handy map of all WING WEEK locations](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/viewer?mid=1HIAl1srahHgvaVkFyUKe7be9wSV7NVo&ll=45.49148966860521%2C-122.6469126 1&z=11), which also makes for a great tattoo. WE ADORE YOU! Thank you so much for partaking and enjoying in the Mercury's food weeks and supporting small local businesses—especially those who may not get the attention they deserve! YOU'RE THE BEST. And, as always, if you appreciate the Mercury's daily efforts to keep you informed and entertained, please consider dropping[ a small contribution](https://www.portlandmercury.com/contribute) so we can keep it going!
