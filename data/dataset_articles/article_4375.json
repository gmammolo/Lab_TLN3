  "text": "Downing Applauds Passage Of Funds for Law Enforcement\nLast week, U.S. Rep. Troy Downing (MT-02) released a statement following House passage of H.R. 6938, the Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act of 2026. The legislation includes nearly $3,629,000 in total funding for local priorities across Yellowstone, Lewis and Clark, Cascade and Toole counties which can be referenced in Division A and Division C of the bill‚Äôs Joint Explanatory Statement. Funded projects include the replacement of a critical piece of infrastructure in the Billings Bench Water Association‚Äôs canal system, upgraded crime scene and communications equipment for law enforcement, and detention center upgrades.\nPassage of H.R. 6938 is a critical step in securing funding for the projects. Following approval by the full House of Representatives, the legislation must be approved by the Senate and signed into law by the president. Each member is limited in the number of projects they can submit, and the application process is extremely competitive. This is the first time in years that a Congressman from Montana‚Äôs Eastern District has advocated for community project funding.\n‚ÄúMontanans, not Washington bureaucrats, know best when it comes to addressing the needs of our communities,‚Äù Downing said. ‚ÄúThese funding requests were submitted in close consultation with local stakeholders and promise to greatly expand law enforcement capabilities and critical infrastructure. If there‚Äôs money to be spent in Montana‚Äôs Second District, I‚Äôll fight for every cent to deliver for my constituents.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhile national trends show some violent crimes declining in major cities, our county has experienced significant strain on our existing detention infrastructure,‚Äù said Toole County Commissioner Terry Tomsheck. ‚ÄúOur current facility is operating well above the recommended 8085 percent capacity threshold for safe and effective facility management. The proposed new detention center will incorporate essential modern features including enhanced supervision capabilities, advanced security monitoring systems, improved safety measures, and specialized housing units.‚Äù",
