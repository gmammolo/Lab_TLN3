  "text": "LOGAN - The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources is giving free access for those sportsmen who have a Utah hunting, fishing or combination license to [Cache Valley Public Shooting Range](https://wildlife.utah.gov/cache-valley.html), located at 2851 W. 200 North in Logan on National Hunting and Fishing Day, Saturday, Sept. 28. Interested people can shoot for free at the rifle, handgun and archery facilities on that day. The [Lee Kay Public Shooting Range](https://wildlife.utah.gov/lee-kay.html), located at 6000 W. 2100 South in Salt Lake City, is offering the same opportunities. “Hunters and anglers are the backbone of wildlife conservation in the U.S.,” DWR Director J. Shirley said. “The discounts at these shooting ranges are a small token of our appreciation to hunters and anglers for funding crucial wildlife projects that help maintain healthy populations of a variety of wildlife species in Utah.” To participate in this offer, people need to show a valid Utah hunting, fishing or combination license at the facility on Sept. 28. They can present either a paper or electronic license. People can download and store their electronic licenses via the [Utah Hunting and Fishing app](https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting-and-fishing-app.html) DWR is also offering rounds for shooting at half price at the trap and skeet ranges at the facilities that day. “These are some of the best outdoor shooting ranges in Utah, whether you are practicing for an upcoming hunt or you just want to have some fun shooting targets,” DWR Hunter Education, Ranges and Shooting Sports Programs Coordinator Gary Cook said. “We hope you’ll take advantage of this offer and visit our two ranges on National Hunting and Fishing Day.” Both shooting ranges will also offer an ongoing, year-round promotion allowing people to shoot for free or at a discounted rate if they’ve purchased a firearm or archery equipment within 30 days of their visit. Proof of purchase must be provided to qualify for the deal. “We want to promote not only fishing and hunting — which are both family-friendly activities — but also shooting sports in general,” Lee Kay Public Shooting Range Manager Blanche Smith said. “Shooting at the range can be a really fun outing for the whole family. Since our ranges and programs are funded through excise taxes from the purchase of shooting equipment and ammunition, as well as the sale of hunting and fishing licenses, we proudly celebrate National Hunting and Fishing Day as a way to thank those who support us.” [Visit the DWR website](https://wildlife.utah.gov/news/utah-wildlife-news/1712-celebrate-national-shooting-sports-month-at-two-ranges.html) for more details about the amenities offered at each DWR shooting range.
