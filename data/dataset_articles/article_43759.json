  "text": "Tommy Fury , already known for his boxing success and famous last name, is now targeting a new arena: mixed martial arts (MMA). Following his win over Jake Paul in the boxing ring, Fury is looking to extend their rivalry into the cage.\nIn a recent video posted to his YouTube channel, Fury made his intentions clear.\nRoberto Ortega \"I'm gonna smash his face in when I get good at MMA,\" he declared confidently.\nFury believes that with a year to two years of dedicated MMA training, he'll be well-equipped to defeat Paul both in boxing and in the cage.\nHis current training includes sessions with UFC interim heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall , which has only bolstered his confidence.\nAspinall 's involvement could significantly enhance Fury 's MMA skills, making this potential matchup even more intriguing.\nThe combination of Fury 's boxing expertise with Aspinall's UFC guidance sets the stage for a compelling crossover fight.\nFans are eager to see if Fury 's striking prowess can translate to the MMA cage and how Paul 's wrestling skills might counteract his opponent's strengths.\nVer esta publicación en Instagram Jake Paul responds to Fury's challenge with verbal jabs The feud between Paul and Fury remains as heated as ever since their boxing clash in Saudi Arabia last February. In that bout, Paul suffered his first professional loss, leading to a desire for a rematch.\nFury recently teased the possibility of a second fight by posting a video of his one-handed sparring on Instagram, inviting Paul to step up for another round. Paul quickly fired back with a cutting comment.\n\"You need money, Tommy? Learn from big bro and stop letting daddy manage your career and finances. You lost out on the biggest opportunity of your life, #PaulTyson. My next offer is going to be half that,\" Paul posted.\nPaul 's comment alluded to a past offer he made to Fury-reportedly a 20-million-dollar deal for two fights, one in boxing and one in MMA.\nPaul claimed Fury turned down this opportunity, and now he is focusing on other significant challenges, including a potential fight with Mike Tyson .",
