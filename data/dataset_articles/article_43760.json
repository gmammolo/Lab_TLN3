  "text": "The Washington Spirit signed defender Tara McKeown to a new four-year contract Thursday.\nMcKeown's contract take effect immediately and now runs through the end of the 2027 season and includes a fifth-year option for 2028. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\"I'm so happy and grateful to be extending my time with the Spirit,\" McKeown said in a news release. \"DC has become my second home and I'm looking forward to the future with this coaching staff and my teammates.\"\nMcKeown, 25, has tallied five goals and six assists in 73 matches (63 starts) over four seasons with Washington, which drafted her eighth overall out of Southern California in 2021. She spent her first two seasons with the team as a forward before moving to defender in 2023.\n\"Tara quickly became an important part of our back line last year and has grown into one of the best center backs in the league,\" team president Mark Krikorian said.. \"Keeping her with the club is an important step as we look to compete for championships.\"\nMcKeown has played every minute of all 20 of the Spirit's matches this season.\nWashington (14-4-2, 44 points) is in second place and trails the league-leading Orlando Pride by four points with six matches remaining in the regular season.\n--Field Level Media",
