  "text": "Tony's dramatic walk-off tater delivers sweet, sweet relief to Birdland BALTIMORE -- Once [Anthony Santander](https://www.mlb.com/player/623993)'s walk-off two-run homer had just barely cleared the right-center-field wall -- a heroic ninth-inning blast that lifted the Orioles to a crucial [5-3 win over the Giants](https://www.mlb.com/gameday/giants-vs-orioles/2024/09/19/746985/final/box) on Thursday afternoon -- the emotion poured out from everywhere at Camden Yards. From the fans roaring. From Santander screaming. From his teammates storming the field. This one felt bigger than most. “We needed it -- a lot,” Santander said. Baltimore has scuffled for much of the second half, but especially of late. The O’s (85-68) had lost eight of their previous 10 games, not able to keep pace with the Yankees (89-63) in the [American League East](https://www.mlb.com/orioles/standings/). They were on the cusp of getting swept by San Francisco. Earlier in the day, manager Brandon Hyde lamented how nothing -- not even the wins -- has been coming even remotely easy for his club, owners of a 27-30 record since the All-Star break. This one wasn’t easy, either. The Orioles couldn’t hold onto a 3-2 lead in the top of the ninth, as Seranthony Domínguez (perfect over his first nine save chances for the team) blew a save opportunity by giving up a game-tying RBI single to Casey Schmitt. However, the contest remained tied after Gregory Soto entered and got Mark Canha to ground into an inning-ending double play on one pitch. San Francisco turned to right-hander Ryan Walker, who had a 1.77 ERA over 72 appearances this season. Baltimore was about to flip its lineup to the top of the order. This one wasn’t getting away from the O’s. “I thought it felt like the guys were doing everything they can to win this game today,” Hyde said. “Not that they haven’t been, but for me, this was a needed win.” After Emmanuel Rivera struck out to open the bottom of the ninth, Gunnar Henderson knocked a one-out single. Then, Cedric Mullins went down swinging. That set the stage for Santander -- the first-time All-Star who has so often served as the heartbeat of the team during his eight-year tenure in Baltimore. Hyde later admitted he was already starting to think about his pitching plans for extra innings, solely because of Walker’s dominance this season. Others knew this one wouldn’t reach extras. “I told [Ryan] O'Hearn that I thought [Santander] was going to hit a homer,” said rookie [Jackson Holliday](https://www.mlb.com/player/702616), who hit a two-run single during a three-run fourth. “I've seen it. I know kind of how he thinks and his approach, and I thought he was going to hit a slider for a homer.” Santander immediately fell behind, 0-2, but the 29-year-old battled. He took an inside sinker for a ball. Then, he fouled off four consecutive pitches, trying to stay alive while waiting for Walker to make a mistake. It finally came in the form of a 1-2 slider -- as Holliday predicted -- that caught the middle of the plate. Santander jolted the offering to right-center, but many in the ballpark held their breath, not sure if it would clear the fence or land in the glove of a leaping Canha for an inning-ending out. “I was hoping for a wind gust. I was yelling, ‘Blow, blow, blow,’” Hyde said. “I didn’t know if he had enough of it or not.” “I was like this [blows three times]. ‘Keep going. Please,’” Santander said. The Statcast-projected 390-foot blast was enough for a home run, Santander’s career-high 42nd of the season. The pressure was finally off the Orioles a bit. Pandemonium ensued. Santander yelled, “Let’s go!” and flexed his arms, starting the celebration for his third career walk-off home run (and his first of the season). “I let them know that that’s who we are,” Santander said. “That’s a reminder of who we are. Close game. We stay positive. We stay together.” Henderson pumped his fist as he rounded the bases. When Santander turned third and headed for home, he tossed his helmet up into the air -- and Colton Cowser swooped in and caught it, using a leaping snag to keep the team’s energy high. Santander got doused with Gatorade, then jumped up and down with his teammates, grabbing their heads. Heston Kjerstad clutched Santander by the front of the jersey and shook him. O’Hearn rubbed Santander’s scalp, then gave him a hearty high-five. “Orioles Magic” blared over the loudspeakers. “That,” Holliday said, “was an unbelievable win.” This one could provide the positive momentum shift the Orioles have needed. Baltimore has nine games to go in the regular season, and it can clinch a spot in the postseason as soon as Sunday. Even if the O’s don’t catch the Yanks in the AL East to capture a second consecutive division crown, a [Wild Card berth seems likely](https://www.mlb.com/orioles/standings/wild-card/league), especially because they control their own destiny. Get into October, and anything can happen. That’s been proven time and again in baseball. This one could be the start of a special run for the Orioles. “It feels huge. ... It was a breath of fresh air, for sure,” said right-hander Zach Eflin, who allowed two runs in six innings. “I think we’re just trying to find our way the past couple weeks. But if everybody continues to do their job and we can continue to rely on each other and pull for each other -- it’s going to be a lot of fun.”",
