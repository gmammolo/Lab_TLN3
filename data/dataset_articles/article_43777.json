  "text": "I am pleased to offer my strong support for Alan Lazar’s candidacy for the LVUSD Board of Education.\nAs a dedicated parent with children currently in our schools, Alan understands firsthand the challenges students face today. He will bring a vital, fresh perspective to the board and serve as a passionate advocate for our children’s success.\nAlan’s past experience supporting our schools and his commitment to being a strong voice for parents is undeniable, and I know he will work tirelessly to represent the needs of our community.\nOne area where Alan and I are particularly closely aligned is the critical issue of limiting cellphone distractions during the school day. He will be a powerful advocate for new policies that help our students stay focused on their education and well-being.\nAlan recognizes that tackling the dangerous effects of social media and unfettered cellphone access during the school day is key to improving both the academic performance and the mental health of our students.\nAlan Lazar’s dedication to fostering a productive learning environment while addressing the social and emotional needs of our students makes him the right choice for our community.\nI urge everyone to vote for Alan—he will be a dedicated and effective advocate for students, parents, and educators.\nDallas Lawrence\nCalabasas\nDallas Lawrence is vice president of the Las Virgenes Unified School District Board of Education.\nI am writing to endorse Alan Lazar for the LVUSD School Board election this November.\nI have had the pleasure of knowing Alan and his family for many years now, and I can confidently say he possesses the outstanding qualities and skills to excel in this position. Alan’s dedication to LVUSD is clear.\nOur kids have grown up together and during that time, very few parents have been as involved and dedicated to improving LVUSD as Alan. I have also had the opportunity to interact with Alan in the business world and I can confidently say that Alan’s ethical standards are solid and unshakable.\nAs a citizen of Calabasas, a parent of three current LVUSD students, and as a former LVUSD student myself, I believe that it is important to elect leaders who are committed to improving our community.\nAlan has demonstrated his commitment to public service and community volunteering, and also sits on several industry boards, as a successful businessman.\nIt’s understandable why all four mayors in our school district have endorsed Alan, along with 12 other City Council members.\nThe most important thing for me is that my kids have the best academic opportunities available to them, and a well-rounded education without ideology of any sort.\nI strongly urge you to vote for Alan Lazar in the upcoming election. I am confident that he will make a positive impact for our schools and our children as an LVUSD School Board member.\nDaniel Schwartz\nCalabasas",
