  "text": "Since beginning his role as interim president of Cal Lutheran University on June 1, John Nunes has immersed himself in the campus culture.\nHe can be seen shaking hands with faculty at concerts and athletic events, learning how to speak Spanish to connect with more students, and waving to Thousand Oaks residents from the golf cart he drives around campus. He believes that connecting with the community matters.\n“I’m called and I’m honored to serve,” said Nunes during an interview hours after his Aug. 29 installation ceremony. “I pray every morning and every night and sometimes I say, ‘Just pinch me’ because this job is such a great job and I thank God every day for the opportunity to serve.”\nMost recently serving as the pastor at Pilgrim Lutheran Church in Santa Monica, Nunes considers his current position the next step in his mission.\nHe said his career has been spent in the faith-based nonprofit space in an effort to help marginalized communities flourish.\nHe was CEO of Lutheran World Relief, a member of the Bipartisan Policy Centers’ Academic Leaders Task Force on Campus Free Expression, a senior fellow at the Center for Religion, Culture and Democracy, and president of Concordia College New York from 2016 to 2021 when the school closed.\nHe describes his leadership style as one of decisiveness but, most importantly, empathy.\n“I’ve really worked hard to be collaborative and transparent and to engender an environment where everyone is valued and everyone has a voice,” Nunes said.\nWith students of color making up 54% of its undergraduate population and 38% of the population being first-generation college students, CLU has the ability to transform lives, he said.\n“I come from a family that has flourished due to the benefit of an education and the access to an education,” said Nunes, who holds a doctorate of philosophy from Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago. “Education is the best anti-poverty program that we have in the United States.”\nThough he was hired on a two-year interim basis to replace CLU President Lori Varlotta, whose resignation became effective May 31, he sees his role as more than a mere placeholder.\n“Two years means there’s some work to be done in the interim, and I’m really excited about that,” he said.\nHe plans to lead a thorough analysis of the university’s business model and budget challenges. This will likely result, he said, in difficult decisions that are necessary to adapt the university and its programs to the current environment of higher education.\nEnrollment has dropped roughly 23% since 2019, and from 2019 to 2023, total operating revenue decreased 4%, according to university data.\nPerhaps the president’s top priority, however, will be improving CLU’s relationships in the community.\n“The board is really concerned around strengthening the culture at California Lutheran University, and bolstering trust and confidence and joy on campus among faculty and staff,” Nunes said. “I hope I can be helpful in that.”\nDuring her four years as president, Varlotta faced criticism regarding her relationships with students, faculty, staff, alumni, donors and community partners. Critics claimed former U.S. Rep. Elton Gallegly’s lawsuit and the departure of the Los Angeles Rams under her leadership damaged the university’s reputation, and she received an overwhelming vote of no confidence by faculty in January.\nFaculty leaders told The Acorn that Nunes has already improved campus morale.\n“I am very hopeful about Cal Lutheran’s future under President Nunes’ leadership,” said Sharon Docter, chair of the Faculty Senate.\n“Nunes already has established very positive relationships with students, faculty, staff and the broader community. He is an inspirational leader who has a keen understanding of what a special place Cal Lutheran is,” she said.\nMichael Hart, faculty representative to the Board of Regents, said: “I have found him to be thoughtful, open to dialogue and collaboration, and very perceptive.”",
