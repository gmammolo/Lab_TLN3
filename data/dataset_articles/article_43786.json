(Photo by Paul Liberatore) By Paul Liberatore | p.liberatore@comcast.net | IJ correspondent UPDATED: September 19, 2024 at 12:52 p.m. In his long and acclaimed career, Marin’s Narada Michael Walden is known primarily as a three-time Grammy-winning record producer who churned out hits for some of the biggest names in pop: legends like Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey.\nIn 1987, two years after he opened his Tarpan Studios in San Rafael, he won the Grammy for producer of the year, non-classical, a prestigious award that has been bestowed on the likes of Quincy Jones, Rick Rubin and, most recently, Jack Antonoff for his work with Taylor Swift.\nWalden’s success as a producer, though, has sometimes overshadowed his prominence as a world-class musician, a jazz-rock fusion drummer who has toured and recorded with such greats as British guitarist John McLaughlin and his groundbreaking Mahavishnu Orchestra, the jazz fusion group Weather Report and Hall of Fame rock guitarist Jeff Beck.\nA new coffee table book, “Narada Michael Walden: Drumming, Spirit and Music” (Hudson Music, $29.99), shines a light on the 72-year-old’s life as a musician, beginning with his childhood in Michigan as a drum prodigy and his career-defining association with McLaughlin, who introduced him to his guru, Sri Chinmoy, an Indian spiritual leader and meditation teacher who gave him his spiritual name, Narada (pronounced NAR-duh), Hindu for traveling musician and storyteller.\nWritten by Canadian drummer Aubrey Dayle, the book is both a biography and a technical manual for drummers featuring transcriptions of Walden’s best-known drum parts.\nA graduate of McGill University and the Manhattan School of Music, Dayle, who’s 60 and lives in Toronto, has been a fan of Walden’s drumming since he was a teenager.\n“Narada’s my hero,” he says. “As a teenager just learning how to play, he was super inspirational. He’s a groundbreaking drummer.”\nThe book is designed to appeal to casual music fans as well as drummers and musicians. It’s packed with photos, stories and interviews with fellow musicians, including McLaughlin and former Journey drummer Steve Smith, who credits Walden with creating “a new way to play jazz, with this big rock approach.”\nNarada Michael Walden plays with guitar great Jeff Beck. (Courtesy of Narada Michael Walden) Billy Cobham, who played with Miles Davis and the Mahavishnu Orchestra and is widely considered the greatest fusion drummer of all time, wrote the book’s foreword.\nCobham wrote about one of his last concerts with the Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1973 and his first encounter with Walden, the then-21-year-old drummer he didn’t know at the time would succeed him in the band.\n“Sitting behind me and my drum kit on the stage floor is a young man with his eyes closed, a smile that indicates total bliss and a full commitment to be exactly where he wanted to be right then,” Cobham wrote, adding, “In Narada, there was a positive image that he projected to all whenever I was around him.”\nDuring an interview about the book last week in the memorabilia-stuffed control room of his San Rafael studio, Walden reminisced, at times emotionally, about his devotion to Sri Chinmoy, who died in 2007, his reverence for McLaughlin, who’s now 82 and lives in Monaco, and those heady days of spirituality and musical exploration at the dawn of his career.\nSitting in an overstuffed leather easy chair, he was wearing one of his signature sleeveless vests and a shiny golden military-style hat of the kind he wore when he was in his high school marching band in Kalamazoo, Michigan, his hometown.\nHe remembered the come-to-God moment when he first heard McLaughlin and Cobham playing a concert in Hartford, Connecticut, that was ear-splittingly loud, but nevertheless precise and clean, combining jazz, rock and funk with unfamiliar Indian influences into an exotic brew that he had never imagined let alone heard before.\n”Their playing was so fierce for so long that I was like, you’ve got to change your life, you’ve got to be like this,” he says. “This is what you’re looking for. You can live and do this music. This is God’s music. This guy loves God. This is the new way.”\nAfter the show, Walden talked his way backstage, hardly believing his luck when he wrangled an introduction to the guitar god he had just seen on stage.\n“I swear to you it was like meeting Abraham Lincoln,” he says. “It was like meeting the hero you never thought you were going to meet. And there he was in front of me.”\nAfter Walden told him that he was a drummer and wanted to be able to play the kind of divine music he’d heard him play that night, McLaughlin arranged for him to meet Sri Chinmoy. During that first encounter, Walden was graciously accepted into the guru’s fold.\n“As he walked away, I felt within me deep gratitude,” he says. “It kind of hit me hard, these eruptions of gratitude or love or whatever those things are. I couldn’t process it all. It was bigger than my mind, bigger than anything I knew.”\nAfter becoming a disciple, he had to wait three years, longer than usual, before the guru would give him his spiritual name during a ceremony called “God’s hour.”\n“I look at this book and that’s what hits me,” he says. “This whole name thing is something I cherish. But it didn’t come easy for me.”\nRight around this same time, he remembers, he played his first impromptu jam session with McLaughlin, who was already a top echelon jazz guitarist and a veteran of Miles Davis’ band, having played on Davis’ historic early electric jazz fusion albums, including “Bitches Brew,” a milestone 1970 record that made musical history as a progenitor of jazz rock.\nNarada Michael Walden plays with guitarist John McLaughlin and his Mahavishnu Orchestra in the mid-1970s. (Courtesy of Narada Michael Walden) The session took place in McLaughlin’s vegetarian restaurant with McLaughlin playing an acoustic guitar and Walden, who didn’t have his drums with him, beating out the rhythm on the guitar case.\n“I think he was playing in some odd meter, but I could hang with him,” he says. “And that was my first test.”\nThe next one came when McLaughlin jammed with Walden and some other musicians in a barn on a farm in Canaan, Connecticut, where Walden was living.\nWalden’s voice quavers with emotion when he describes a solo that McLaughlin took during that life-altering session.\n“What he does is he looks at me with a face I had never seen before, a stone face, and the sound was enormous, like Jimi Hendrix,” says Walden, choking back tears. “I said to myself, ‘I am not going to let this man freak me out.’ So I closed my eyes and then I was fine. I could play and get out there and roar with him. But he was trying to freak me out and it was terrifying. To this day, it freaks me out. He was really just trying to see what kind of man I was, that’s what I think.”\nWhatever his reason, McLaughlin would ask him to join the band after Cobham left. Walden would tour internationally with the Mahavishnu Orchestra for three years and record three albums, “Apocalypse” in 1974, “Visions of the Emerald Beyond” in 1975 and “Inner Worlds” in 1976.\nThat experience, portrayed in the new book, would turn Walden into the powerhouse drummer he became and would give him the spiritual foundation that has sustained him through the rest of his life and career.\n“That saved me,” he says. “At the time, I thought, ‘I’m going to live.’ It saved my life.”\nContact Paul Liberatore at p.liberatore@comcast.net\nOriginally Published: September 19, 2024 at 12:00 p.m. Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Most Popular Most Popular Student arrested after ‘altercation’ at San Rafael middle school Student arrested after 'altercation' at San Rafael middle school Marin Senior Fair draws crowds Marin Senior Fair draws crowds Asking Eric: My husband’s strong feelings about my yearbooks raise a red flag Asking Eric: My husband’s strong feelings about my yearbooks raise a red flag Mill Valley preschool files $2.5M claim against district Mill Valley preschool files $2.5M claim against district Larkspur approves general plan, housing element Larkspur approves general plan, housing element Prep basketball: Season of change as Carr joins Redwood, commits to Cal Prep basketball: Season of change as Carr joins Redwood, commits to Cal San Rafael fire damages business, vehicles San Rafael fire damages business, vehicles Inverness resident arrested on assault allegations Inverness resident arrested on assault allegations Kimberly Guilfoyle ‘blindsided’ by Donald Trump Jr.’s ‘dalliance’ with Palm Beach socialite: report Kimberly Guilfoyle ‘blindsided’ by Donald Trump Jr.’s ‘dalliance’ with Palm Beach socialite: report MCE weighs association with Diablo Canyon nuclear energy MCE weighs association with Diablo Canyon nuclear energy Trending Nationally",
