The program supports the Alliance for Catholic Education (ACE), sending graduates to teach in underserved Catholic schools while pursuing a master's degree. Highlight events include a banner ceremony at St. Jude Catholic School and recognition of ACE teachers during the Notre Dame vs. Miami (OH) game on September 21. Donations to ACE will be matched by the Foundation up to $125,000 until December 31. This partnership enhances ACE’s programs and fosters community connections surrounding education.\n- Over $5 million raised for Catholic schools through Extra Yard for Teachers.\n- Nearly $200,000 allocated for grant projects by ACE teachers over the years.\nWhile the initiative has garnered significant funding and support, challenges remain in addressing the specific needs of underserved schools and attracting more volunteers for teaching positions.State of Play\n- Ongoing fundraising through matched contributions until the end of the year.\n- ACE continues to develop partnerships to improve educational offerings and recruitment.\nFuture initiatives may focus on expanding grant opportunities for ACE teachers and possibly increasing partnerships with more universities to broaden the program's reach.Bottom Line\nThe Extra Yard for Teachers initiative represents a significant commitment to education in underserved communities, showcasing the importance of collaboration between educational institutions and local organizations to foster long-term improvements.\nRead more at\n Notre Dame Fighting Irish - Official Athletics Website\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
