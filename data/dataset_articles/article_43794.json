  "text": "The Turkey Day Dash committee will award two $500 scholarships in the name of a Thousand Oaks High School graduate who lost his life in 2023.\nSuccessful applicants for the Zack Zernick Memorial Scholarship must be high school juniors or seniors who have participated in at least two extracurricular activities and have a 3.0 GPA or higher. They must attend school in one of the following communities: Agoura Hills, Calabasas, Camarillo, Moorpark, Oak Park, Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Westlake Village or Ventura. Home-schooled students are eligible.\nThe deadline to apply is Tues., Oct. 22.\nThe scholarship is named for Zachary “Zack” Zernik, a Thousand Oaks native who died at the age of 22 while hiking near Mount Boney outside Newbury Park. As an Eagle Scout and avid hiker and climber, Zack loved the natural world and everything in it. He also was active in wrestling, volleyball, distance running, saxophone, Scouting and woodwork.\nZack was passionate about everything he did. He sought to make the most of every moment, and encouraged others to do the same.\nApplicants should be individuals of strong character with a wide range of interests, particularly related to fitness and the outdoors. Applicants should have some record of community service, whether through a sports team, school club or nonprofit organization.\nThe application form is available at\nfive07turkeydaydash.org/zack-zernik-scholarship.\nWinners will be selected by the Dash committee, which includes Zack’s mother, Elizabeth, and announced at this year’s Five07 Turkey Day Dash, happening Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 28 on the campus of Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks. The event includes a 5K and the Zack Zernik Mile.\nEvent host Five07 is a locally-owned community coffee shop. Its name represents the five steps owners Sean and Amber Rendineo believe lead to creating something of importance: inspiration, build-up, resistance, overcoming and collaboration.\nFor more information about the scholarship, email or go to\nturkeydaydash.org.",
