  "text": "When Brianna Adams told me she was running for the Oak Park Municipal Advisory Council, I could not have been more overjoyed. I have had the privilege of working with Brianna for four years now as a parent volunteer and can tell you with the utmost confidence there is no better candidate for this board than her.\nBrianna brings heart, tenacity, experience, reliability, strength, accountability, respect, a vision aligned with goals in place as well as her focused determination, to the table. Not to mention, her positivity and uplifting personality make it a joy to work with.\nI have seen Brianna come in and out of two schools now, having entered and left it better than she found it. Over the years, she has helped improve general facilities at Oak Hills Elementary and Medea Creek Middle School for the entire student body to enjoy and benefit from.\nWhen she focuses on the betterment of an Oak Park community project, there is no project too big or too small that she can’t handle. It seems her main objective is always to serve the community as a whole, not just projects that benefit a small group of people.\nWe are a community that will benefit not just from her friendship as a kind, patient and graceful person but also as a strong leader with heart who is an agent of change. I strongly feel she will listen to the concerns of the entire Oak Park community when it comes down to making citywide improvements.\nI am excited to see where Brianna will help take Oak Park in the years to come, or for she truly believes it is a worthwhile endeavor to always help make your community a better place for everyone.\nJennifer Moeller\nOak Park",
