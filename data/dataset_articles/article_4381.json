  "text": "(Luis Cornelio, Headline USA) President Donald Trump’s youngest son, Barron, helped save a woman’s life in London after calling law enforcement when he saw her being attacked during a FaceTime call, according to court records.\nThe Daily Mail reported Wednesday that Barron contacted London police after allegedly witnessing a man assault the woman during an argument over her relationship with him.\nDetails of the call were disclosed during the criminal trial against the alleged assailant, 22-year-old Russian national Matvei Rumiantsev.\nCourt documents alleged that the suspect became enraged after answering the woman’s ringing phone and realizing she was speaking with Barron.\n“You are not worth anything,” the man allegedly shouted while grabbing the woman’s hair and pushing her to the floor, according to the outlet.\nNEW: Barron Trump is being credited with saving a woman's life after she was being attacked by her ex-boyfriend in the UK, according to Metro.\nThe revelation came from the woman, who told a London court that Barron Trump's quick thinking saved her life.\nAccording to the report,…\n[pic.twitter.com/BSFABt6yxp]— Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg)\n[January 21, 2026]\nRumiantsev is facing charges of rape, assault, bodily harm and perverting the course of justice. He has denied all charges.\nThe Mail noted that an emergency dispatcher initially struggled to obtain details from Barron, who was presumably calling from the United States.\nBarron told the dispatcher he had met the woman through social media, though the dispatcher pressed for additional details.\n“Can you stop being rude and actually answer my questions?” the dispatcher said. “If you want to help the person, you’ll answer my questions clearly and precisely, thank you. So how do you know her?”\nIn response, Barron stated that he “met her on social media,” adding: “She’s getting really badly beat up and the call was about eight minutes ago, I don’t know what could have happened by now.”\nHe later apologized, reportedly telling the dispatcher that he was “sorry for being rude.”\nThe call was placed shortly after 2:00 a.m. on Jan. 18, 2025.\nAccording to body-cam footage from responding officers, the woman told police that she was friends with Barron, prompting one officer to remark: “So apparently this informant from America is likely to be Donald Trump’s son.”\nThe woman credited Barron with helping save her life, describing his call as a “sign from God.”\nThe Mail reported that the trial is ongoing.\nA transcript of the purported call appears below:\nOPERATOR: City of London Police how can I help you?\nBARRON: Oh I’m calling from the US, uh I just got a call from a girl, you know, she’s getting beat up. The address is [Redacted]. This was happening about eight minutes ago. I just figured out how to, how to call someone. Uh, uh it’s really an emergency.\nOPERATOR: What’s her name?\nBARRON: Her name is [Redacted].\nOPERATOR: Her date of birth?\nBARRON: It’s really an emergency, please.\nOPERATOR: How do you know her?\nBARRON: I mean these details don’t matter, she’s getting beat up like I…\nOPERATOR: Yeah I know but I need to take information from you so how have you come by this information?\nBARRON: Uh I got a call from her with a guy beating her up.\nOPERATOR: Okay how do you know her?\nBARRON: I don’t think these details matter she’s getting beat up but okay fine, also I met her on social media, I don’t think that matters.\nOPERATOR: You know I can…\nBARRON: She’s getting beat up!\nOPERATOR: Can you stop being rude and actually answer my questions. If you want to help the person, you’ll answer my questions clearly and precisely, thank you. So how do you know her?\nBARRON: I met her on social media.\nOPERATOR: Okay.\nOPERATOR: Know the partners name or the person that’s beating her up at all?\nBARRON: No.\nOPERATOR: And they’re at home, they’re not out into the street?\nBARRON: Correct. She’s getting really badly beat up and the call was about 8 minutes ago, I don’t know what could have happened by now.\nOPERATOR: Okay.\nBARRON: So, sorry for being rude.",
