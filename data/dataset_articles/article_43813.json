  "text": "The\nIndiana Chapter of BHA hosted their 4th annual Rendezvous at Rockville Lake Park Campground this last weekend. The event was a massive success and rollicking good time!\nThree dozen people descended on the\nRockville Lake Park property Friday afternoon and kicked things off with cold beverages around the campfire, stories of success and near misses on big game public land hunts, and some folks enjoyed late night catfishing.\nSaturday began with a stewardship event, including trail work, clearing brush to create better access for shore fishing, and paddling kayaks to pick up trash along the shoreline. After that, the group gathered for a wild game taco bar, provided for free by members of the Indiana Chapter Board of Directors. This included caribou, smoked barbacoa venison, and wild turkey fajitas.\nWe were joined for lunch by members of the Indiana State Trappers Association, who following the feast gave a shortened version of the Trapper Education Class. Participants learned about the history of trapping, types of traps, where to strategically place them, and a trap setting demonstration.\nAfter this, the group stoked the fire, grabbed cold beverages, and kicked back and prepared for the raffle. This is one of our biggest fundraisers of the year, and in addition to merch sales we were able to raise significant funds that will go directly back into supporting the national BHA and defending Indiana's public lands, waters, and wildlife.\nSome great prizes were available this year from our sponsors, including swag bags with items from the Indiana Turn-In-a-Poacher, deer scent from Hoosier Trapping Supply, our state-level sponsor who also donated an awesome coyote trapping kit. We also had a BullDog XP Archery target, ground blinds from FeraDyne Outdoors, binoculars from Vortex, a dozen full body speck decoys donated from our members, and gift cards from Waltons, SportDog, and Work Sharp.\nSaturday night we gathered around the campfire and talked about some of the most pressing conservation issues in Indiana. After the fundraising, conversation, and recruitment, we called our Rendezvous a success. Following the event, we had folks who were in attendance sign up for memberships and follow us on our social media. We are looking forward to the next one!",
