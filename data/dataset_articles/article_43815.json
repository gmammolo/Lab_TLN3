  "text": "The\nPhillies magic number for the National League East is four games. As it happens, the Phillies will be playing their next four games against the second-place team in the division. Which means that if the Phillies win this series, they will clinch the division in the home stadium of one of their division rivals.\nWouldn’t that be nice?\nNew York Mets\nRecord: 84-61, Second place in National League East (Seven games back)\nThe last time they Met\nThe\nMets came to Philadelphia last weekend, and after Aaron Nola had a rough time in the series opener, the Phillies rebounded to win the next two thanks to unexpected heroes like Buddy Kennedy and Cal Stevenson.\nSince then?\nWhile the series loss to the Phillies severely damaged their hopes of winning the division, it clearly didn’t dishearten the Mets. They rebounded to sweep the Nationals, scoring 23 runs across the three-game series.\nWho’s cold?\nJ.D. Martinez has had a down season, and it’s been especially down lately. He’s batting just .163 over the past month, and it's been a minute since he last recorded a base hit. The six-time All Star just turned 37, and if the full-time DH can’t hit anymore, this might be the end of the road for him.\nJD Martinez needs a day off... Maybe 2 days off.— Mike Peters (@Mike_Peters_LGM)\nHe's 0 for his last 24\n[September 18, 2024]\nWho’s the Manaea?\nYou could probably guess that Francisco Lindor leads the Mets with 6.6 wins above replacement. But do you know who ranks second behind him? It’s pitcher Sean Manaea at 3.2. Manaea has gone slightly under the radar this season, but he’s had a very good year and has been excellent in the second half.\nSean Manaea's last 10 starts:— Frank Stampfl (@Roto_Frank)\n2.49 ERA, 0.80 WHIP, 75 K over 65 IP\nHe's gone 7 IP in six of those starts.\n[September 17, 2024]\nManaea will get the ball on Saturday, his third start against them this season. Of the previous two, one went well for him (One run in six innings), the other did not (Six runs in 3.2 innings). Let’s hope this start is another for the “not” category.\nAnother Acuña?\nThe Phillies caught a break when Braves star Ronald Acuña, Jr. missed most of the season with an injury. And now all of a sudden, there’s another Acuña in the division who looks like he could be a pain in their butts. Mets rookie shortstop Luisangel Acuña was arguably their best player in their sweep of the Nationals,\nImagine saying in April Acuña has played a big role late in the National League Wild Card race...— Mark Suleymanov (@TheMARKOut1)\n...And that Acuña being the one on the Mets, not the reigning MVP\n [September 19, 2024]\nTake care of business\nObviously, the Phillies are in the driver’s seat as far as the National League East goes, but it would be really nice if they made it official and didn’t give the Mets even the faintest glimpse of pulling off a miracle. (Also, if the Phillies have clinched the East, they can root for the Mets when they play the\nBrewers in the final series of the season.)\nAnd what of the wild card?\nThe Padres have a strong hold on one of the National League’s Wild Card berths, while the other two are still being contested by the Mets,\nArizona Diamondbacks, and Atlanta Braves.\nEach team in the National League Wild Card race snagged a win last night, so the Mets will head into their massive four-game set with the Phillies holding a two-game advantage over the Braves in the standings— SNY Mets (@SNY_Mets)\n[pic.twitter.com/9a2om4LmpV] [September 19, 2024]\nPhillies fans have reasons to dislike all three of those teams, and while it would be nice for all of them to miss the postseason, that fate will befall only one of them.\nThe Mark Brendanwicz award\nZack Wheeler\nWheeler is likely going to finish in the top two of National League Cy Young Award voting in 2024, but you may not have realized that the Phillies’ ace once pitched for their division rival, the New York Mets.\nJust kidding, we all knew he used to be a Met. I just wanted to make fun of the Mets for developing him so that he could become a star for the Phillies.\n\"[We] helped him parlay two good half-seasons over the last 5 years into $118 million\"— SNY (@SNYtv)\nBrodie Van Wagenen took a jab back at Zack Wheeler\n [pic.twitter.com/sHFv2yv2Lb] [February 14, 2020]\nWhere and when?\nBecause the television executives apparently think that Phillies vs. Mets will be a ratings draw, we’re going to get all four games of this series on different networks. Thursday night will be nationally televised by Fox. Friday is an AppleTV+ exclusive. Saturday afternoon’s game will be on NBC Sports Philadelphia, and the finale will be on ESPN’s Sunday Night Baseball.\nGood luck to everyone with relatives who aren’t tech savvy!\nClosing thought\nI haven’t gotten to see the Phillies clinch the National League East in 13 years. I’d love to see it happen this weekend.",
