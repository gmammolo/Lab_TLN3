  "text": "By Jeremy Jenkins ,\n1 hours ago\nTickets now on sale for Heartland International Film Festival INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) – Tickets are now on sale for the 33rd edition of the Heartland International Film Festival , which will take place from Oct. 10 – Oct. 20 across multiple venues in Indianapolis.\nThis year, the festival is inviting moviegoers to “Expand Your Universe” with an intergalactic theme and a robust lineup of over 120 films from around the globe.\nArtistic Director Greg Sorvig appeared on Daybreak with News 8’s Jeremy Jenkins to discuss what audiences can expect from this year’s festival, highlighting its diverse film selection and unique focus.\n“We ask everyone to expand their universe with this year’s theme,” Sorvig said. “But what can cinema really do? It can expand your viewpoints, tackle different topics, and explore new themes. We have a great lineup—over 120 films from around the world.”\nThe festival will screen films at five different venues across the city, including The Tobias Theater at Newfields , Emagine in Noblesville, Kan-Kan Cinema , and Living Room Theaters . According to Sorvig, many of the films will play twice, with major studio releases typically scheduled for a single screening.\nOne of the biggest highlights of the festival is the opening night screening of “A Real Pain,” directed by and starring Jesse Eisenberg. The film, which premiered at Sundance and won the Screenwriting Award, also stars Emmy-winner Kieran Culkin.\n“This is a phenomenal film,” Sorvig said. “Jesse Eisenberg writes, directs, produces, and stars in it. He wears an IU hat for two-thirds of the film, so there’s a fun Hoosier nod there. It’s sharp, and you’ll be one of the first audiences in the world to see it on Oct. 10.”\nThe festival will also feature the Indiana Spotlight category, showcasing 11 films by Hoosier filmmakers. One standout is “A Waiting Game,” which focuses on ABA players and the NBA merger, spotlighting the fight for players’ pensions and support. Cash prizes will be awarded in this category to support local talent.\nSorvig noted the festival’s personalized and welcoming atmosphere, encouraging attendees to connect with filmmakers who will be present throughout the screenings.\n“You can make real connections with these amazing creatives,” Sorvig said. “It’s what makes this festival special.”\nTickets for individual screenings and virtual options are available now.
