  "text": "Ventura County Animal Services successfully found homes for 77 animals during a recent Clear the Shelters adoption drive in Camarillo and Simi Valley.\nAbout 150 people braved the high temperatures and waited outside the Camarillo shelter’s gates before the 11 a.m. opening in hopes of adopting their next best friend.\nThis marked the 10th year VCAS has participated in Clear the Shelters, a nationwide initiative where adoption fees are waived. It’s become VCAS’ largest pet adoption event of the year.\nServices such as neutering, spaying, vaccinations, flea treatments and a voucher for a free veterinary checkup were included in the adoption process.\nEven though fees were waived, adoption counseling and screening still ensured that each animal went to a suitable home, with potential adopters informed of any medical or behavioral issues.\nThe event is part of a broader campaign spearheaded by NBCUniversal Local and Telemundo in partnership with local shelters and rescue organizations.\nSince 2015, Clear the Shelters has helped more than 500,000 pets across the country find homes.\n“This is our one pet adoption event of the year where we try to clear out as many animals as we can to amazing homes,” said VCAS spokesperson Randy Friedman.\nOver the course of the six-hour event, all 46 cats and kittens available for adoption found homes. Seven rabbits, a guinea pig and a turtle also left the shelter.\nHowever, out of about 170 available dogs, only 22 found were adopted.\nIn past years, the combined number of pets adopted at the Camarillo and Simi shelters has often exceeded 100.\n“If it hadn’t been for the heat, we believe more families would have adopted dogs,” Friedman said.\n“Despite the heat wave we are thrilled to share that 74 animals still found loving homes.”\nAmong the dogs adopted last Saturday were Rusty, a husky, and Wiley, a husky mix puppy renamed Slick. Another dog, Penelope Pillow, a Labrador retriever mix, also found her forever family.\nNot all animals were ready for adoption at the event and more animals have since arrived, so VCAS encourages visitors to return and help find homes for the remaining pets.\nLast month, VCAS declared an “extreme crisis” due to a surge in stray dogs and a nationwide decline in adoptions. The shelter was overcrowded and dogs were forced to share limited kennel space.\nAs of Sept. 8, 193 dogs and 54 cats were available for adoption, including those that were not ready to be adopted at the event. Twenty-nine rabbits and a chicken were available, too.\nTo view available animals and for more information, go to\nvcas.us",
