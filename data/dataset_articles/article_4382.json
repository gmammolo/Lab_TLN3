  "text": "Five volunteers officially joined the Bossier Parish Sheriff’s Posse after successfully completing a five-day training course at the Viking Substation. Sheriff Julian Whittington welcomed the new members and emphasized the importance of the Posse and the vital role it plays in supporting deputies and serving the community.\nParticipants received hands-on training in driving evaluations, funeral escort procedures, accident response, traffic direction, communications and radio procedures, crime scene preservation, officer safety and much more.\nSheriff Whittington said, “Volunteers are becoming harder to come by, and we are extremely proud of the men and women who choose to serve on the Sheriff’s Posse. They selflessly give their time to help keep our parish safe, and their commitment makes a real difference in our community.”\nFounded in 1995, the Bossier Sheriff’s Posse is made up of dedicated men and women volunteers who assist with patrol and community service responsibilities, allowing deputies to focus on critical law enforcement duties.\nInterested in joining the Bossier Sheriff’s Posse? Contact Lt. Mason (Viking Substation) at (318) 747-8600.",
