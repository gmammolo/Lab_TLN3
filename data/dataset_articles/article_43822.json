Fantastic to keep a clean sheet.\"\nIt was the first ever clash between the sides with Atalanta having qualified for the competition by finishing fourth in Serie A last season, while they also won the Europa League.\nWhile Atalanta will be frustrated at not beginning with a notable victory, Gian Piero Gasperini's side showed that they will be a tough nut to crack in the group phase.\nSource: Reuters Sign up for our newsletters Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nSubscribe here Get the CNA app Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nDownload here Get WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nJoin here Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...
