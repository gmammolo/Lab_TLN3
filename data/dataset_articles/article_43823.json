BERGEN COUNTY, NJ — Friends of the Bergen County teen whose parents and sister were killed in a crash on the Garden State Parkway on Saturday have raised more than $140,000 to help him finish college and honor his family's memory. Max Dryerman, 19, of Woodcliff Lake was at college in Philadelphia when his sister Brooke, 17, and his parents, David and Michele, were killed in a single-car accident on the Parkway in Woodbridge this weekend. Friends said they were heading home after attending the Sea Hear Now music festival in Asbury Park. The GoFundMe was started with a goal of just $1,000 for Max to give to his sister Brooke's favorite charity. But the fundraiser took on a life of its own.
