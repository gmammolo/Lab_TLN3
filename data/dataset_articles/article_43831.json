  "text": "For his 90th birthday this year, Russell Walton's only wish was to demonstrate his enduring skill and determination by shearing a sheep, just as he did back in his prime. Born in the Geelong district of Victoria, Mr Walton's early years were shaped by the tough but rewarding world of shearing. Leaving school at just 14, he started as a rouseabout and quickly learned the ropes of the trade, driven by a determination to build a better life for himself. At 16, Mr Walton was shearing 70-80 sheep a day, and by 17, he was shearing 100 sheep a day. \"It was a big deal, much like scoring a century in cricket,\" Mr Walton said. Despite earning good money, Mr Walton said his wages still went straight to his father, which was a common practice at the time. In 1975 Mr Walton, his wife Marie and their four children moved to Queensland, leaving behind the tradition of handing his wages to his father. \"I certainly was no gun shearer, but considered myself a good local shearer that shore between September and into November,\" Mr Walton said. \"I could shear consistently 140-160 per day, with my best tally being 183 in good quality merino ewes and 202 weaned merino lambs. \"I liked sheep and wanted to shear, being a rousy for two local brother shearers, one, Tom, was a very good shearer, and I just wanted to shear like him. \"All this was done on narrow shearing gear.\" Today, Mr Walton is still active and works on the farm, splitting his time between the home property Tarcoola, near Macalister, and Milrae, at Jandowae, where he loves working with his dogs, black Angus cattle and improving his property. The desire to \"shear one more sheep\" was sparked by a casual remark, which led Mr Walton to believe he was still physically up to the job. \"A few months ago, when my son asked what I wanted to do to celebrate turning 90, I said 'I reckon I could shear one more sheep,\" Mr Walton said. \"We recently restored our old dairy and bull shed for a family wedding, and it turned out a treat, so we thought that would be a great place to have smoko after the shearing. \"We worked at restoring the old gear in the woolshed on our farm, getting the 80-year-old engine going, and restoring the old narrow cutting gear.\" Mr Walton travelled three hours to Warwick Saleyards and sorted through 1500 sheep to find one that was just right for the big day. \"We only have a few sheep on the farm that I use mostly to train my dogs,\" he said. \"We didn't have one quite the right size, so I headed to Warwick three hours away and amongst the 1500 head going to market that day, I found one just the right size for me to show off on my birthday.\" In preparation for the milestone event, Mr Walton restored old shearing equipment and ensuring the experience was authentic to recreate the traditional shearing environment. The old scales, press, basket, and table were cleaned and placed in their traditional spots in the restored shed at Tarcoola. Mr Walton even set up a clock with a sweeping second hand, just as he had used in his earlier days, to time his shearing. \"I put up a clock in the old shed, because in my day, I spent a lot of time in single stand sheds and really had to watch the second hand to make sure I could get through one sheep in three minutes to get my quota done so I could make that 300 pounds,\" he said. Family and friends, many wearing Jackie Howe blue singlets, joined in to celebrate his achievement. The atmosphere was filled with joy and reverence as Mr Walton, dressed in his work clothes, threw off his shirt and began shearing in his blue singlet with a towel slung over his shoulder-just as he had done so many years ago. A traditional celebratory smoko, featured his late wife Marie's famous home-baked goods. \"We had a great spread of home cooked baking and cups of tea for smoko, and my late wife Marie would have been proud of what was on display, because she was a great cook,\" Mr Walton said.
