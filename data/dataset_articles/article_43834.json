  "text": "Houston, Texas – The Houston Dash is gearing up to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month with exciting festivities at Shell Energy Stadium. As part of the club’s commitment to honoring the rich culture and contributions of the Hispanic community, fans can engage in interactive and educational activities celebrating Latin American culture throughout the concourse.\nLocal artists, including the renowned Donkeeboy, will be honored during the pre-match ceremonies. His custom-painted soccer balls will be displayed in front of the Legends Wall, offering fans a chance to see art inspired by soccer and Latin culture. There will be a wall map of Latin America where fans can pinpoint their heritage, and various stations highlighting the contributions of the Latin community in Houston.\nFor younger fans, coloring stations will offer opportunities to create sugar skull art, country flags, and designs inspired by Mola and Embera Tribe Art. Face painters will also be on hand to add an extra splash of color to the festivities.\nThe Dash’s Noche Latina match against Seattle Reign FC on Saturday, Sept. 21.
