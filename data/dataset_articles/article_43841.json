  "text": "Are you in the market for a private island?\nIf yes, a newly-listed cottage country property should be high on your radar.\nPerched in the midst of Lake Muskoka, in a sought-after pocket of Ontario's coveted cottage country,\n1 Bass Island is a private island and luxurious remote abode all in one.\nThe value and privacy of the whole island is a rarity, highly sought after by the affluent and famous, ensuring solitude all to yourself. For those looking to entice the entire family to live on Bass Island, the land is approved to be further severed — with potential for five lots — where each lot can hold their own cottage and boathouse. The listing offers a serene hideaway alongside unrivalled custom designs and world-class amenities.\nAnd when we say world-class, we're not exaggerating. From a tennis court to a Nordic spa-style plunge pool and sauna, through to a helipad, this cottage compound has it all.\nSpanning the entire 11-acre Bass Island, this jaw-dropping property is home to a 6,652-sq.-ft main cottage, complete with six bedrooms (four of which have private ensuites), a two-storey boathouse with living quarters, a network of walking trails, and more.\nSpecs\n- Address:\n1 Bass Island\n- Bedrooms: 6\n- Bathrooms: 6\n- Size: 6,652 sq. ft on 11 acres\n- Price: $14,950,000\n- Listed By:\nBen and Dan Imrie, Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd. Brokerage\nOnce you've touched down on the helipad, you're invited to meander through the professionally landscaped property to arrive at the island's main event: a three-storey cottage featuring stunning contemporary designs (both inside and out) and expansive floor-to-ceiling windows that afford residents unobstructed lake vistas.\nInside, you're greeted by a light-filled interior, defined by modern design touches that elevate the already-stunning space even further.\nA sunken living and dining room pairing, which overlooks the lake, serves as the heart of the home, offering a cozy hub for friends and family to gather. And with various walkouts to a spacious upper deck, the space mingles seamlessly with the surrounding natural environment.\nSharing the open-concept space, a dazzling kitchen overlooks the living area, boasting high-end appliances and marble galore. And while each of those aforementioned bedrooms is retreat-like in its own right, the primary — with a spa-like ensuite and direct lake views — is particularly swoon-worthy.\nOur Favourite Thing\nOur favourite thing about this property is, naturally, that it includes its own private island. And, the incredible sense of seclusion considered, it's still ultra easy to access. With East Bay Landing and Mortimer's Point Marina a quick boat ride away, all you have to do is ensure you pack the boat.\n(Although, there's always the helipad...)\nNow for the true call of any cottage: relaxation and leisure.\nWhat really sets this property apart is the sheer number of top-tier creature comforts it offers residents and guests. On the home's lower level you'll find a jetted workout pool, hot tub, cold plunge, cedar sauna, steam room, and massage shower. Plus, there's no shortage of activities, with walking trails, a tennis court, and a three-slip boathouse for launching a day of water sports.\nWith built-in fun and relaxation, you'll likely never want to leave Bass Island. But when it's time for a food run or you want to spend an afternoon shopping locally, vibrant Port Carling is a scenic boat ride away. Plus, the region is home to several high-end golf clubs and stunning hiking trails.\n\"Rare Muskoka gem\" is a common moniker for upscale cottage country getaways, but few truly earn the descriptor. This sprawling cottage estate is a rarity, and a way to make your mark on the Muskoka landscape. Combining prime location with sleek designs and an incredible slew of amenities, you simply won't find another cottage like it any time soon.\nWELCOME TO 1 BASS ISLAND\nENTRY\nLIVING AND DINING ROOM\nKITCHEN\nBEDS AND BATHS\nLOWER LEVEL AND AMENITIES\nOUTDOOR\nPhotography: Ben Carlin,\nMuskoka Virtual Tours\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________",
