  "text": "Tovino Thomas starrer ‘Ajayante Randam Moshanam (ARM)’ continues to run houseful in many centers across the state. The film directed by debutant Jithin Laal, features Tovino Thomas in triple roles. As the film garners appreciation and wins the hearts of the audiences, Basil Joseph has lauded the team’s effort.Basil Joseph, who is a successful director has acted in ‘ARM’ along with his confidant Tovino. In a note shared on Instagram, Basil Joseph recalled how Jithin Laal, the director of ‘ARM’ started off his career with him, and has finally delivered his debut directorial. “ARM is making waves globally, and as someone who has closely followed the journey of these two blessed talents, I couldn’t be more proud. Jithin and I started our filmmaking careers together with short films, and later he joined our direction team for ‘Kunjiramayanam‘ and ’Godha’. I remember him sharing his dreams for ARM during the ‘Godha‘ days back in 2017. Fast forward seven years to 2024, and witnessing his hard work pay off in such a historic way is incredible. I can confidently say, Jithin is here to stay. I’ve seen firsthand the challenges he had to overcome to bring this mammoth of a film to life, especially as his debut. The roadblocks were many, even a day before its release, but his dedication and passion never wavered. His journey proves that genuine effort and perseverance always pay off in the end,” Basil said, lauding the ‘ARM’ director. Basil Joseph was also thrilled to see his friend and frequent collaborator Tovino Thomas acing three roles for the film. “As for Tovi—he absolutely nailed all three avatars: Ajayanan, Kunji Kelu, and Maniyan. But it was Maniyan that truly blew me away, a career-defining performance. The swagger, the intensity—it shows just how much Tovi has grown as an actor. I’m immensely proud to call him my friend and to have witnessed his evolution. Tovi has been Jithin’s strongest pillar throughout this journey, going above and beyond what an actor typically does. Together, they’ve proven once again that hard work pays off. Congrats, guys! There’s so much more to come. Keep making us proud!” he added. 113436713113494047Meanwhile, ‘ARM’ is also making solid numbers at the box office.",
