  "text": "Forget the rig, you can go enjoy nature with your project car. We hear excuses all the time about reasons people do not drive their cars: Too much money invested, the parts are “rare”, and so on. These amazing builds end up collecting dust. Enjoyment of your car can go beyond the collection of parts and comparison of spec sheets amongst others. Some enthusiasts, such as this NSX owner shows us what enjoyment really can be.\nThis particular owner packed up his tent, supplies, trusty co-driver and went straight for the mountains. A weekend break with his favorite car and friend. As he drives, details such as updates to the car that are being planned and reasons like needing functional air conditioning were covered. Reflecting on the thoughts we also have for our own cars.\nUpon arrival the NSX beautifully sits with a vast natural background. A big change from the car show venues, cars and coffee parking lots, and other typical locations. The Thule cargo box and trunk full of goods gets removed slowly as the owner enjoys the fresh air.\nThe tent and camping gear setup creates a comfortable space for him and his dog. Dinner prep begins with refreshing soups and beverages. There is a sense of peace when preparing a meal instead of just ordering out.\nAfter going for a good walk, it is time to settle down for the night. A warm cup of coffee pairs well with a gloomy evening.\nAs the night settles, another view of the NSX in different lighting occurs. The aero kit, aftermarket wheels, and other modifications all work in harmony to bring you to a new adventure.\nThe joy of exploration also brings rock chips and other forms of patina. Each blemish holds a memory that adds to the overall story of the car. Collect memories, not dust, as others have stated before.",
