  "text": "A few weeks ago, I enjoyed a car show that took place in a wealthy and well-known suburb just north of Indianapolis.\nThe remarkably well-attended event served as a testament to the community’s shared passion for classic beauty on four wheels. The cars were phenomenal — polished to a mirror sheen, each curve and contour a celebration of craftsmanship intertwined seamlessly with utility (no sport necessary). It was an outdoor congregation of engineering marvels and a nostalgic homage to the automotive achievements of many nations.\nThe weather contributed its own melodic note to the symphony of the day — temperate and forgiving, as if nature consciously fostered an environment of enjoyment and appreciation. The ambiance was effortlessly pleasant, characterized by the kind of light-hearted camaraderie that can be hard to find these days.\nIn a world that is increasingly polarized by political puffery and the cacophony of constant campaigning, it is rare to find a sanctuary that affords one a temporary reprieve from the seemingly relentless struggles of life. Amid this serene backdrop, where politics seemed as distant as the moon, I was starkly reminded of our current social climate by a bold statement that was emblazoned on a passerby’s T-shirt: “I’m Voting for the Felon.” This unexpected jolt back to reality underscored an ironic truth — the oasis of calm was but a veneer, beneath which the tumult of political strife continued to churn.\nThe person who was wearing the T-shirt wasn’t grandstanding; he was merely one of thousands of people whose fascination with luxury and classic automobiles was being sated. Nonetheless, the sentiment called to mind the rapacious spread of misinformation and disinformation that is infecting our body politic specifically, and our social fabric more broadly. In this case, the disinformation is that Donald Trump has been unfairly targeted by a “weaponized” judicial system — by political enemies who will stop at nothing to keep him out of the White House.\nFaith in the integrity of the electoral process is an indispensable component of genuine democracies, including our own. The cynicism that has engulfed American political discourse is a corrosive force that, if left unaddressed, could ultimately lead to our demise as a nation. The good news is that the antidote to such poison is evident and abundant: just tell the truth. Accept victory with humility; accept defeat with grace.\nUnfortunately, such faith is incredibly low today, especially among Republicans, whose political and “news” leaders have shamelessly lied to them. Led by Donald Trump, they have increasingly trafficked in lies about how the 2020 presidential election was “stolen.” Tragically, this political game of throw-the-rock-and-hide-your-hand led to a failed coup and ongoing violence. Words have consequences — deadly ones when those words are highly irresponsible.\nOur nation, and much of the world, is starving for integrity of actions and the courage to uphold truth. Instead, we feast on half-truths and whole lies, then are somehow surprised at the ensuing political and social indigestion. History is replete with examples of the perils that await us if we succumb to the expedient over the ethical, the popular over the principled.\nIn such tumultuous times, events like the car show can become more than just a welcome distraction; they represent a fleeting, yet vital, simplicity and a communal appreciation for more innocent joys. These gatherings highlight the contrast between the world as it is as compared to how it could be — a place where shared interests bridge divides.\nAs we stand at the crossroads of history, facing down the specter of continued political disillusionment, we must ponder: What will lead us to a path of unity and faith in our collective endeavor? The answer lies not in the overt exercises of power but in fostering genuine connections and understanding. Fortunately, we’re in the driver’s seat.",
