  "text": "Magelang (ANTARA) - The Environment and Forestry (LHK) Ministry on Thursday organized the Festival of Collaboration for Sustainability at Menoreh hill, Magelang district, Central Java, as part of an effort to promote the rehabilitation of watersheds. On the occasion, Dyah Murtiningsih, the ministry's director general of watershed management and forest rehabilitation, said that the government has devised the Forest and Land Rehabilitation program to help Indonesia achieve the targets outlined in its Nationally Determined Contributions document. According to a statement received from the Magelang government, she made the remarks while speaking on behalf of LHK Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar at the festival. Murtiningsih said that efforts to rehabilitate watersheds in Menoreh are a follow-up to the directives of President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) regarding the development of agritourism. \"We can see that the Menoreh hill genuinely lacks water. For that reason, President Jokowi has instructed Madam Minister to take rehabilitation measures,\" she informed. The director general then highlighted that the main objective of the rehabilitation of Menoreh's watersheds is to identify the most suitable planting and preservation measures and enable more transparent and accountable evaluation schemes. Meanwhile, Magelang regional secretary Adi Waryanto said that the festival is meant to step up collaboration between the government, people, and business actors to support the continuous rehabilitation of forests and watersheds. He noted that the district government has taken a variety of environmental preservation measures, which have included forming the Jogo Tuk community, establishing a tree bank, conducting periodic reforestation, organizing dissemination and mentoring, creating infiltration wells, and arranging a profile book of water springs.
