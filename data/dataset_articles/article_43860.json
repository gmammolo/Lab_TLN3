I was curious about the answer myself, so I did my research! In this blog post, we’ll identify the top\nlab-grown engagement rings with suggestions on what styles and shapes are trending.\nBut first, let’s talk about sparkle.

Here are some of the best lab-grown diamond rings, rated with high reviews and accolades in their categories, by one of the experts in the industry:\nBen Garelick.\nLet’s get started: you have a proposal to plan! :)\nBest Princess-Cut:\nAstra\nGo with this timeless and interstellar style featuring a 2-carat princess-cut diamond on an artistic setting that features meticulous milgrain detailing.

Anyone can tell you to purchase lab-grown vs. mined, but what are the actual reasons why couples are going wild over this alternative? Here are three major reasons why lab-grown rings are the best option when choosing a diamond.\n1. Affordability\nMany favor lab-grown jewelry simply due to the affordability factor. Lab-grown diamonds are less expensive than mined diamonds. Since they can be produced in large batches in a short period of time, lab-grown are considerably less expensive than natural diamonds.\n2. Ethical and Conflict-Free\nOne major reason couples turn to an alternative to mined diamonds is simple: they’re ethical, eco-friendly, and conflict-free.\n3. Brilliance of Lab Grown vs. Natural Diamonds\nOne major reason why couples are looking to buy lab-grown diamonds for engagements is that most people cannot tell the difference. No one can tell the difference because they are both diamonds. Lab-grown diamonds are the best option when choosing a diamond ring if you want to purchase a diamond that shines just as bright as a natural one.\nTo the untrained eye, you will not likely be able to tell the difference between the two. Can a lab-grown diamond pass a diamond tester? Likely, an expert jeweler may be able to tell the difference between these two kinds of diamonds based on special inclusions under high magnification. They have different types of inclusions that occur when the diamond is created. However, as mentioned, most won’t be able to look at your diamond and tell it’s lab-created; it is just as sparkly and brilliant. No one will be able to tell, since both options are true diamonds.\nAre Lab-Grown Diamonds Real Diamonds?\nYes. According to diamond expert\nhttps://www.bengarelick.com/collections/lab-grown-complete-diamond-engagement-rings, lab diamonds are, in fact, real diamonds. “From breathtaking engagement rings to stunning necklaces and earrings, our complete collection features an array of exquisite designs, expertly crafted to showcase the extraordinary beauty of lab-grown diamonds. Embrace a future-forward choice that celebrates love and supports sustainability with Ben Garelick’s lab-grown diamond collection.”\nAre Lab-Grown the Same as Simulation Diamonds?\nNo. It’s important to note that lab-grown diamonds are NOT the same as simulated diamonds. Simulants to diamond rings — like cubic zirconia and moissanite — have a different chemical makeup and composition when compared to a diamond. So, don’t search for simulated and think you’re getting lab-grown diamond rings: they are made entirely differently.\nLab-Grown diamonds are diamonds, they are just made by humans instead of mother nature. Focus on the 4 C’s when you shop: cut, color, clarity, and carat are just as important on lab-grown diamonds as mined diamonds.\nHow to Spot Quality Lab-Grown Diamond Rings\nThe best way to spot quality diamond rings that are lab-grown is to find a retailer that is reputable (read reviews online!), offers a vast collection of lab-grown diamond rings and NOT simulated diamonds, and also has independent GIA certification on your ring when you order it. This is important: you want to have a ring with certification, whether you buy lab-grown or natural diamonds.\nAs shown on this list, lab-grown diamond rings offer many benefits vs. natural earth-mined diamonds. You are expressing your love and commitment, so you should always choose the best ring that is right for you. Whether that is lab-grown or natural, you’ll find plenty of options to suit your needs.\nFor more on lab-grown diamonds and how they’re made,\nread this guide.\n► Now that you know more about lab-grown vs. natural diamonds and their benefits, let’s go shopping! You can build your own ring starting with a lab-created diamond\nhere. It’s easy and completely customizable.\nThis is a partnered post.",
