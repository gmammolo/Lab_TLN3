  "text": "XWas Niel going to enter the Olympia stage in socks? Those black socks or those with tartan patterns that he shows off by putting his feet on the table when we visit him in his office at the [Paris](/tag/Paris) headquarters of Free? No. For his show How to become a billionairethe head of the telecom operator bursts out from the orchestra in well-polished black shoes and a black tuxedo of a… gala billionaire. In the audience, curious onlookers, young thirty-somethings with an entrepreneurial spirit, guests, Free employees, students from the 42 computer science schools or the Station F start-up incubator. The seats sold out in a few hours, at a price between 2 and 40 euros, like Free’s packages. “It will be childish,” he warned before claiming the tone of the influencers Squeezie and Léna Situations, or even the Pessi, this community of “bald Messis” on social networks. From the outset, Xavier Niel makes fun of the way in which the creation of the operator Free 25 years ago has changed its image. He thus shows the qualifiers with which he is saddled on the Internet: “reptilian ex-pornocrat”, “pimp”, “satanist” (the Free messaging number is 666)… “People think I got Macron elected. They’re right!” he says to a laughing audience. And the ninth richest person in [France](/tag/France) (22.1 billion euros according to the magazine Challenges) to assure that one does not “need to be a genius to be a billionaire” but that it is enough to be an entrepreneur. Albert Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci… “A high IQ but no start-ups”, he sneers. Elon Musk “completely crazy” His voice sometimes stressed while looking at his discreet prompter when needed, Xavier Niel lets loose through the laughter that his jokes provoke. His first piece of advice? “Go to prison.” And the founder of Free returns to the hours he spent in the Santé prison after being arrested for “pimping” because of his risky investments in sex shops in 2004. According to him, the entrepreneur must “bite the yellow line without ever crossing it”, like Uber which plays with the taxi legislation or Airbnb with that of hotels. He quotes a maxim that is taught in business schools: “All success is made up of lots of failures.” “I messed up on M6, on CGR cinemas, on Casino. I spend my time messing up. Do you think I had a chance of winning M6? No, but we played.”READ ALSO “Elon Musk can be seen as a visionary philanthropist or a ruthless capitalist” Xavier Niel praises diversity, mentioning the “five founders of Free with three different religions”, and professes that the important thing is the team with which you start. A team of more or less eight people, who, like at Amazon, do not need more than two pizzas to feed themselves. To entertain the public and catch their breath, the entrepreneur has prepared video clips: a sketch with Léna Situations as a styling consultant and him in Louis Vuitton jogging pants or a Batman costume, a fake documentary from his pink Minitel years, an exchange with Squeezie or even a pseudo-report from the Brut media in which he invested and which he takes on a tour of the catacombs. “The catacombs are super weird, the entrepreneurs are a bit weird too,” he says, back in a relaxed version – jeans and white sneakers. He therefore advises to “Make a Pact with the Devil”, that is to say to ally yourself with the most shady people on Earth, like a Elon Musk “completely crazy but his company is worth 50 times more than the other manufacturers”. Xaviermedoit20balles.com Of course, Xavier Niel loudly praises the “purchasing power he has given back to the French” with Free. But he doesn’t tell the whole story. He doesn’t advise, for example, investing in property, he who made so much money betting on real estate. He seeks the public’s love by offering them pizzas, giving out his real email address or promising to reimburse 20 euros to those who bought their ticket to the Olympia on the website xaviermedoit20balles.com. With his advice and “schoolboy” jokes, as he had promised, the billionaire seems to be getting a taste for the stage. He wants, he confides, to leave the spectators with a positive message. Even if it sometimes seems like he’s taken from a self-help book, like: “We don’t care about business plans. The only limit is you. The best investment is investing in yourself. You have to believe in your dreams.” READ ALSO Thiel and Niel, the visionary and the tycoonThe former kid from Créteil talks about the social ladder that sometimes remains too blocked, as in his book of interviews with his friend Jean-Louis Missika, former vice-president of Iliad and former deputy for urban planning at Paris city hall, A real desire to cause trouble. He leaves the Olympia hall hoping to have sown “a little seed of entrepreneurship” in at least one spectator. At the exit, queues form to buy the book of the “guru” to be published by Flammarion. “The ego-trip” by Xavier Niel in TEDx mode seems to have won over. On the Boulevard des Capucines, two thirty-somethings motivate each other: “Let’s stop being employees and start a company. Okay, but we’re going to have to come up with an idea.” A young girl fumes: “It’s not with this rotten advice that I’m going to become a billionaire!”",
