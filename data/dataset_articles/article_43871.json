  "text": "An 8-year-old boy from Baie-Comeau, suffering from leukemia, has broken the Canadian record for the longest rock snake by assembling 11,840 rocks in less than a month. Hugo Jobin wanted to create the longest rock snake in the world at Parc des Pionniers in Baie-Comeau. This idea came to him during his treatments to fight leukemia. At 8 years old, this gesture was a way of giving back to the community. TVA News Screenshot Hugo’s rock snake has over 18,500 rocks so far, and is over a kilometer long. The city of Baie-Comeau has even changed the mowing of the lawn at Parc des Pionniers so as not to damage the rock snake. TVA News Screenshot This phenomenon now extends beyond the borders of Baie-Comeau. The rocks and stones come from all over Quebec and even overseas. Individuals and companies help Hugo transport and varnish the rocks. TVA News Screenshot Hugo’s parents and friends invest several hours a week in the project. The 8-year-old’s next goal is to break the North American record, located in Texas, which has more than 25,000 rocks. See the full report above.",
