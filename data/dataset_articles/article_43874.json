  "text": "[Andrea Deyrup, MD, PhD](https://pathology.duke.edu/profile/andrea-t-deyrup), has been named to the [Pathologist Magazine’s Power List 2024.](https://thepathologist.com/power-list/2024) The Pathologist solicited nominations of pathologists and laboratory professionals in any stage of their careers who have made accomplishments in the past year in one of the following categories: - Heroes of Pathology – problem-solvers for those in difficulty - Champions for Change – drivers of environmental, social, and governance initiatives - Idols of Innovation – researchers, inventors, and transformers - In the Wings – non-pathologist laboratory medicine professionals - Destined for Excellence – rising stars Deyrup was one of 20 Champions for Change awardees, selected by The Pathologist’s judging panel composed primarily of past Power Listers. Deyrup was recognized for her advocacy work to inspire pathologists to reject race-based medicine and discard outdated beliefs about biological race. In [her award biography](https://thepathologist.com/power-list/2024/champions-for-change/andrea-deyrup) she implores pathologists to commit to science-based data instead of conjecture or prejudice and calls for an honest evaluation of science and the truths it holds. She recognizes as an inspiring leader Joseph L. Graves, Jr., the first African American to earn a PhD in evolutionary biology. “He is one of the most extraordinarily productive scientists I know, and his role as an antiracist leader is readily apparent in his numerous books on the topic,” wrote Deyrup. “But it is not just Dr. Graves’ scholarship that inspires me; it is also his fierce commitment to justice, truth and scientific accuracy. The opportunity to work with and learn from someone who embodies this commitment has helped me reframe my role in this work and urges me to push even harder.” Deyrup is a nationally renowned speaker on the topic of race in medicine. In March 2024, she participated in a panel discussion following a presentation on “Using Race, Ethnicity, and Ancestry as Population Descriptors in Genetics and Genomics Research.” It was hosted by Duke’s [Precision Genomics Collaboratory](https://medschool.duke.edu/research/research-initiatives/precision-genomics-collaboratory/people/precision-genomics-0) and [Trinity College of Arts and Sciences](https://trinity.duke.edu/). Leaders were Duke professor [Charmaine Royal, PhD](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/charmaine.royal), and New York University professor [Aravinda Chakravarti, PhD,](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/aravinda-chakravarti) co-chairs of the [2023 National Academics of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) Report](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26902/using-population-descriptors-in-genetics-and-genomics-research-a-new). It emphasized the importance of ensuring that genetics research benefits all groups in society and mitigates harm. A large focus of Deyrup’s work has been to examine the questionable science that supports race-based associations in medical texts and board exams. After finding that the data were often inaccurate and misinterpreted, she has been building connections through presentations and a popular video series to end racialized medicine.
