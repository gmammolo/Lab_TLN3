  "text": "SOSHANGUVE residents receive title deeds. The City of Tshwane has taken a significant step towards empowering its citizens by handing over 197 title deeds to deserving beneficiaries in Soshanguve Extension 6, Ward 90, Pretoria. This milestone marks a major breakthrough in the city's quest to provide security and property ownership, unlocking the doors to economic empowerment, social mobility, and a brighter future for hundreds of families. During the handover ceremony on Wednesday, September 18, the city announced that it has successfully handed over a total of 2 311 title deeds in the area. In recent months, visits were conducted in other parts of Eersterust, Soshanguve, and Elandspoort to hand over title deeds. MMC for Human Settlement, Ofentse Madzebatela, said: \"As a city, we are proud to facilitate security of tenure for these beneficiaries and will continue to prioritise the handover of title deeds as we recognise the importance of giving ownership rights to beneficiaries.\" [ALSO READ: RINGA NATHI: She calls patients tokoloshes](https://www.snl24.com/dailysun/news/mzansi-speaks-out-hospital-horror-stories-and-healthcare-worker-struggles-20240919) She reminded residents that a title deed is a legal document and must be kept in a safe place as proof of ownership and for future reference. Madzebatela further emphasised the importance of protecting properties against fires, storms, and natural disasters. \"Residents must make protection arrangements with reliable, registered, and reputable insurance companies in the event of damage to their properties,\" she said. The city still has a large number of unclaimed title deeds due to difficulty locating some beneficiaries. \"Beneficiaries without title deeds are encouraged to visit local regional offices to enquire about the status of their documents,\" Madzebatela said. The handover of title deeds showcased the administration's dedication to safeguarding housing beneficiaries' property rights. Residents like Mmanoko Mabaso were overjoyed and expressed gratitude for the city's efforts in educating them on the importance and proper care of title deeds. \"I was unaware of its purpose, but now I understand,\" Mmanoko said. Michael Mokimisi, who inherited his parents' home, praised Legal Aid South Africa for helping him navigate the complex ownership transfer process. \"I faced a lot of challenges, even going to court to protect my family's home from unauthorised sale. I'm thrilled to have secured my title deed,\" said Michael. [this link](https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaHB5ez7tkj0FuHQkQ0s)",
