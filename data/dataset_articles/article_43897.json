  "text": "A year in, the Hurd Welcome Center has become an anchor on Baylor’s campus A year ago this time, Baylor was celebrating the opening of the brand-new Mark and Paula Hurd Welcome Center. Since then, the Hurd has become exactly what university leaders hoped it would become: the new “[front door to campus](https://www2.baylor.edu/baylorproud/2023/08/hurd-welcome-center-now-open-as-baylors-front-door-to-campus/),” and an important part of campus life for both current and prospective students, faculty, staff, and alumni. A quick look back at the Hurd’s first 12 months: After a ribbon-cutting ceremony, the Hurd held its first official event last September: [Howdy at the Hurd](https://www2.baylor.edu/baylorproud/2023/09/hurd-welcome-center-dedication-followed-by-howdy-at-the-hurd-celebration/), a new twist on [Baylor’s annual Texas welcome](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cw9UpBlNGvl/) for new students.
