  "text": "Consent Practices for Performing Arts Classrooms is out now! Consent Practices in Performing Arts Education By Elaine DiFalco Daugherty and Heather Trommer-Beardslee This book explores consent as a foundational principle to guide practices and policies in university level performing arts education. It includes descriptions of the structural power dynamics present in educational spaces as well as tools for defusing them. It adapts the consent-forward protocols that are foundational to intimacy training in order to apply them to classroom and rehearsal spaces across performing arts disciplines. This includes opening lines of communication, actively discussing personal boundaries and modeling behavior that respects those boundaries. Additionally, the book uses experiential reflections to address the real-world challenges that teachers face as they work to reshape their teaching habits and processes to include consent practices.[www.intellectbooks.com/consent-practices-in-performing-arts-education](https://www.intellectbooks.com/consent-practices-in-performing-arts-education)",
