  "text": "Groundbreaking begins at Catholic Memorial High School for Sullivan Campus\nMILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- A new era at Catholic Memorial High School Begins today.\nEarlier this afternoon, Catholic Memorial High School students, staff and alumnus gathered for the ceremonial groundbreaking of what's being called the Sullivan Campus.\nThe moniker is dedicated to the project's lead donor and Catholic Memorial High School alum Tim Sullivan.\nAt the groundbreaking on Thursday, Sept. 19, he said the gift is an opportunity to pay it forward to the next generation.\n\"I've been very successful in my career, and I think it all stems from where you get your education,\" said Sullivan. \"It's incumbent on us to give back and make sure the next generations coming up have the same kind of opportunity that we had to become successful.\"\nOnce it is complete. the Sullivan Campus is expected to both elevate and expand the athletic and education facilities on the property, something Catholic Memorial High School calls a historic step for the school.",
