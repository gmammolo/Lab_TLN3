Every night before bed it's meal prep time for the following day, which generally consists of some overnight chia pudding, a simple salad with a boiled egg, and some tofu for protein. It seems silly, but it saves time and mental energy for the following day. And for the editorial staff at [ICanHasCheezburger](https://cheezburger.com/36889349/21-hissterical-fluffy-feline-memes-for-funny-feline-fursday-feels), the vast majority of our mental energy must be invested in [ our fancy feline friends](https://cheezburger.com/36922629/20-charismatic-cat-memes-to-meowtivate-feline-lovers-to-laugh-their-way-to-the-end-of-the-week) and writing content that both entertains and appeals to our friendly feline-loving readers.
