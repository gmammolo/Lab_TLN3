  "text": "Shawn and Serena Levy have found their place with A Sense of Home.\nThe couple will be honored at the nonprofit’s fourth annual gala, set to take place at the L.A. home of Ted Sarandos and Nicole Avant on Oct. 24. The Levys are longtime champions of the organization, which works to prevent homelessness by creating first homes and a community for youth aging out of the foster care system. Their support is said to have been vital in furthering A Sense of Home’s work.\nIn a joint statement, the Levys said it’s an honor to be acknowledged for their support “but it is even more of an honor” to contribute to A Sense of Home’s mission and the lives changed by its work, led by founder and CEO Georgie Smith.\n“Our involvement with A Sense of Home for close to a decade now has been one of the most fulfilling experiences of our family’s life,” the couple continued. “Few philanthropic organizations allow for such an intimate and visceral connection with the people they serve, and the several home-creations we have done with ASOH are core experiences and memories for our daughters and us. We have been so inspired by witnessing the work and impact of ASOH in the lives they touch, the futures they help shape. The homes that ASOH provides for former foster youth often make the difference between a new chapter infused with hope and a life on the streets, and so it is our pleasure to support this groundbreaking organization in any way that we can.”\nThe gala — an event that connects Shawn Levy and his Netflix boss together after having worked closely with the streamer on the Stranger Things franchise and All the Light We Cannot See — will also feature a performance by American Idol alum Phillip Phillips with an additional surprise musical guest to be revealed in the coming weeks. Other highlights include curated food and beverages and a silent auction. Sponsors include Ruggable, Living Spaces, OSEA and Pomello. The first two companies, named as critical partners of A Sense of Home, will be outfitting the space for the night.\nEvent co-chairs include Jena King and Michael Rosenfeld, and Charlotte and Gary Gilbert, who were honored last year . The host committee is star-studded: Millie Bobby Brown, Jake Bongiovi, Jennifer Garner, Amy Adams, Hugh Jackman, Channing Tatum, Matthew Macfadyen, Tobey Maguire, Amanda Anka, Jason Bateman, Kaia Gerber, Michelle Rodriguez, Camila Morrone, Chord Overstreet, Emma Corrin, Kevin Feige, Jeremiah Brent, Nate Berkus, Mark Duplass, Katie Aselton, Molly Sims, Scott Stuber, Rachel Zoe, Rodger Berman, Jennifer Meyer, Soleil Moon Frye, Ari Emanuel, Patrick and Pia Whitesell, Alan Bergman, Kristin Hahn, Jeneva Bell, Drew Scott, Elyse and David Walker, Sara Gilbert, Emily and Jon Favreau, Hanna and Tommy Vietor, Richard Weitz, Antoine Fuqua, Emile Hirsch, Lukas Linemayr, Teddy King, Alexandra Trustman, Linda Konner, Britt and Harvey Mason Jr., Bela Bajaria, Charlotte McKinney, Ivette Rodriguez, Julie and Jimmy Darmody, Kat Samick, Lyndie Benson, Irena and Mike Medavoy, Susie Sheinberg, Regina Louise, Lucila Sola and more.\nAs for the hosts, Sarandos and the former U.S. ambassador Avant say they are honored to open up their home for another gala. “We have been working side by side with ASOH from the very beginning and we are dedicated to providing comfortable living spaces to young people who are aging out of the foster care system,” said Avant. “Join us as we celebrate our friends and honorees, Shawn and Serena Levy, who have dedicated their efforts to empower these young individuals and help them build a better and stronger future for themselves.”\nSpeaking of the future, proceeds raised from the gala fundraiser will be directed towards A Sense of Home’s effort’s to scale and continue to create homes in L.A. and grow supportive services in employment, education and wellbeing. Over the next year, A Sense of Home is eyeing an expansion into communities in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.\n“A Sense of Home was born from a random act of kindness — turning one empty apartment into a home for a former foster youth. It spawned a movement to prevent homelessness and break the cycle of acute inequality and poverty for those impacted by the foster care system. What has resulted is young people exiting foster care with a sense of home and a sense of community. The life-changing impact we’ve seen this have on one of our most vulnerable populations – those aging out of foster care – affords a corrective experience, after a lifetime of displacement and associated trauma,” founder and CEO Smith said in a statement.",
