  "text": "CHENNAI: Madras high court has ordered 5 lakh each as compensation to two minor girls who were subjected to penetrative sexual assault at a fake NCC camp conducted by a private school at Krishnagiri last month.The first bench of Acting Chief Justice D Krishnakumar and Justice P B Balaji also directed the state to provide Rs 1 lakh each compensation to other survivors who too were targeted at the camp.The court ordered that the compensation awarded shall be recovered from the private school that allowed the fake NCC camp.The court passed the orders on a public interest writ petition filed by advocate A P Suryaprakasam who sought a CBI probe into the incident.Earlier, when the plea came up for further hearing on Thursday, Tamil Nadu Advocate-General P S Raman requested the court to conduct an in-camera proceeding as the issue pertained to minor girl students and as the state had to share details of the sexual assault.Opposing the request, Suryaprakasam submitted that even the Supreme Court had refused such a request made by senior advocate Kapil Sibal in the RG Kar Hospital case.Recording the submission, the bench directed the AG to submit the details of the probe in a sealed cover so that the court could take a decision on the request for in-camera proceeding.The state further informed the court that the school education department has appointed a special officer to administer the private school. The court then adjourned the hearing to Sep 30.",
