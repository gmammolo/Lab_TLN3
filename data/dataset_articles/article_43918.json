  "text": "Join me for an exciting flight summiting Africa’s Highest Peak; Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m / 19,341 ft). Later on, I traveled on Air Tanzania for the first time. I boarded a chartered Cessna Caravan flight from Arusha Airport. The flight came with oxygen mask and supplies. We must use oxygen once reaches over 14,000 ft as it is an unpressurized flight. There was a lenticular cloud that covered the top of Mt Kilimanjaro. The view was absolutely incredible at 20,000 ft. Kilimanjaro is the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world. We circled around and managed to see the volcanic peaks of Kibo and Mawenzi. Before returning, we also looked at Mount Meru (4,562m/14,967 ft), Africa’s tallest mountain before eruption. The view was out of this world. We saw the peak in just an hour by flight compared to a 10-day trek. Next, I flew out of the bush and headed for the beach at Zanzibar and stayed at the newly opened Bawe Island Resort. At the end of my trip, I traveled on Air Tanzania Dash8-400 from Zanzibar to Dar es Salaam, which is just 15-minute hop. From there, I flew on Air Tanzania B737 MAX 9 to Dubai. Check out my flight and Air Tanzania Twiga Lounge.",
