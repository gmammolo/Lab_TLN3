  "text": "ROSEBURG, Ore. – A rededication ceremony for the Douglas County Veterans War Memorial was hosted by the Douglas County Board of Commissioners and local veterans groups on Wednesday at the Douglas County Courthouse, county officials said. Douglas County officials said that the memorial, which stands on the courthouse grounds and was first constructed in 1971, honors those Douglas County residents who died while serving their country. After receiving an Oregon Heritage Veterans and War Memorial grant from the state parks and recreation department in 2023, the memorial underwent a year-long renovation effort that began in September of last year, the county said. Officials said that the renovation project included replacement of four of its bronze plaques that commemorate fallen Douglas County veterans, refurbishment of the memorial grounds, a new Purple Heart memorial, new gold star and blue star bronze plaques, two new flag poles to display the POW/MIA flag, and beautification of the grounds around the memorial. Previously, a minor restoration project was done in 2007 but some repairs were left unfinished, county officials said. “Speaking on behalf of Commissioner Chris Boice, Commissioner Tom Kress, and myself, we dedicate this Douglas County Veterans War Memorial as a sacred place in Douglas County where veterans will gather to share experiences or sit alone where they can ponder thoughts of which they can never share with anyone,” said Commissioner Tim Freman, during his keynote speech at the ceremony. “Those who need to can use this memorial as a place of healing. We dedicate this memorial as a place where children will learn lessons of freedom from their parents and grandparents. We dedicate this memorial as a place where those coming after us will recognize our desire to acknowledge those who have sacrificed so much for our freedom, and they will be encouraged to place the same importance on this site as we do today. Thank you and May God Bless the United States of America.” Douglas County officials said that the commissioners also issued a proclamation during the ceremony declaring September 20 as POW/MIA Recognition Day in Douglas County. A live video recording of the ceremony can be found on Douglas County’s",
