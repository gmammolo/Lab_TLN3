  "text": "By Adam Holt ,\n2 hours ago\nThe New Orleans Saints have won a lot of folks over in the first two weeks of the 2024 NFL season. Apparently, their dominance over there Carolina Panthers and Dallas Cowboys has not proven enough to one star wide receiver for an NFC foe.\nDetroit Lions wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown made his stance on the Saints clear once again earlier this week on he and his brother's podcast, The St. Brown Podcast .\nLions WR Amon-Ra St.Brown still doubts the Saints \"\"I'm not retracting any statements that I made earlier.\"\n\"I feel like the Cowboys have those games. They'll have great games then have a bad game. You probably just caught them in one of their bad games. You guys still don't move me.\" -- Amon-Ra St. Brown\nThe Cowboys are, in fact, known for rough games out of nowhere. Those have come in both the regular season and the postseason. That being said, there cannot be an excuse for every big win from the Saints.\nSt. Brown has a point when it comes to the Cowboys. While they routinely churn out 12-win seasons, the Cowboys do have a tendency to lay an egg every so often. And while the Cowboys have said themselves that they weren't at their best, the Saints obviously deserve credit for how well they played. -- CBS Sports\nIn Week 1, the reasoning was the weak opponent in Carolina. Now, Week 2's victory does not mean much because of Dallas' struggles rather than New Orleans' production.\nAmon-Ra made some headlines during the offseason for his Saints discussion with his brother, Equanimeous, too. The latter is on the Saints' practice squad.\nThe Lions wideout has doubted New Orleans for months. He did not believe that even Saints players, themselves, believed that they were contenders entering this season.\nMeanwhile, the Saints WR is not phased by his brother's comments. He's focused on his team continuing their hot start and looking forward - rather than backwards.\n\"We know about all the shit-talking going on about the Saints, from the springtime, everyone counting us out. We knew about all that. You counting us out.\"\n\"We're not on our high horse. We've got to focus on the Eagles right now. We've won two games, but that doesn't matter now. It's in the past. We're onto our next game.\"\n-- Equanimeous St. Brown\nAll in all, we will see which one of them is correct about the Saints over the rest of the season. New Orleans plays the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 3 .\nRelated: NFL drops the hammer on Saints QB Derek Carr for having too much fun during win over Cowboys\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
