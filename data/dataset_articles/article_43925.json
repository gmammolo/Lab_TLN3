The two artists also discuss their shared history of coming up in the hip-hop world during the 1990s, the enduring legacy of Wu-Tang Clan, and balancing Method's very public career while preserving his privacy as a family man.

With an acclaimed career that has spanned four different decades, Joe has cemented his legacy as a hip-hop heavyweight, having amassed several multiplatinum and gold studio albums, mixtapes, singles, and collaborations, including \"Lean Back,\" \"What's Luv,\" \"Make It Rain,\" and \"All The Way Up,\" among countless others. Beyond his unprecedented longevity, Joe - who is of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent - has played an integral role in bridging the intersection of hip-hop and Latin music, collaborating with Gloria Estefan, Thalia, Ricky Martin, etc. Joe has also displayed an eye for discovering and developing new talent, having signed the likes of DJ Khaled, Big Pun, Remy Ma, and more to his Terror Squad label imprint. Most recently, Joe reinvented himself into a media personality, hosting the 2022 and 2023 BET Hip-Hop Awards and episodes of The Drew Barrymore Show and The Wendy Williams Show. His pivot into media began in 2020, when he launched \"The Fat Joe Show,\" an Instagram Live talk show where he interviewed a wide array of guests, such as Dr. Anthony Fauci, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Floyd Mayweather, Jamie Foxx, etc. Those experiences ultimately paved the way for Joe to get his own show on STARZ. The Bronx native expanded his résumé and became an author in November 2022, releasing his memoir, The Book of Jose, which pulled back the curtains on the trials, tribulations and triumphs throughout his personal life and professional career. Joe's acclaimed memoir is in the process of being converted into a television series on Showtime that will be executive produced by Kenya Barris. He has shined in acting roles, most notably starring alongside Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish in \"Night School\" as well as in Spike Lee's \"She's Gotta Have It\" Netflix series. He is also slated to star alongside Susan Sarandon in an animated comedy series called \"The Movers\" that is currently in development at FOX. Joe is also the owner and founder of three UP NYC stores in New York City, which sells exclusive sneakers from brands such as Jordan and Nike as well as sports apparel, caps, etc. Joe is also the co-owner of Rewind It 10, a men's at-home beard and hair coloring collection.
