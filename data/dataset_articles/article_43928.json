  "text": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) - Is it Tee time? Bengals receiver Tee Higgins returned to practice on Thursday. The 25-year-old missed the first two games of the season with a hamstring injury, and he was a limited participant in the practice. He had not practiced at all since suffering the injury on Sept. 5, three days before the Bengals opened the season at home against the New England Patriots. He also did not participate in either of the first two games. \"See where it goes from there,\" head coach Zac Taylor said ahead of practice. \" We need him.\" The Bengals, who started the season with losses against the Patriots and at the Kansas City Chiefs, host the Washington Commanders for Monday Night Football. \"He's a top player in this league,\" said Taylor of the possibility of getting Higgins back. \"That makes every personnel grouping better when he's in it. Him and Ja'Marr (Chase), obviously two guys that draw a lot of attention singularly, so when we've got them on the field together, it's certainly good assets to have.\" Higgins is playing this season on the franchise tag that pays him a guaranteed $21.8 million after his agent and the Bengals couldn't come to terms on a contract extension. The Bengals used a significant amount of two tight end, two wide receiver alignments in last week's game against the Kansas City Chiefs, due in part to not having Higgins. The alignment worked so well that it may even continue when Higgins returns with him and Chase manning the two wide receiver spots. \"I think having Tee on the field, I don't care what we're in, we're better,\" said offensive coordinator Dan Pitcher. \"It helps getting him back, regardless of what personnel grouping we're in, certainly 12 with Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins out there is pretty -- you know, I think it'll be a good grouping for us.\" Said quarterback Joe Burrow: \"We’re obviously a better team with Tee out there. He’s going to continue to get healthier and healthier. Hopefully we have him on (Monday). If we don’t, we still feel confident in the guys that we have. We’re obviously more dynamic and a much better team with Tee out there.\" The Bengals are also dealing with several other injuries. Neither of the team's starting defensive tackles -- Sheldon Rankins and B.J. Hill -- participated in Thursday's practice as they are each dealing with a hamstring injury that knocked them out of the Kansas City game. \"We'll just keep going day-to-day,\" Taylor said of their status. The good news at that position group is that rookie Kris Jenkins Jr. was a limited participant after missing the first two games due to a thumb injury leading up to the opener that required surgery. Rookie offensive tackle Amarius Mims, who missed the first two games due to a pectoral muscle injury, was also a limited participant. Veteran safety Vonn Bell (ribs) and veteran tight end Mike Gesicki (calf) were surprise limited participants in Thursday's practice. Tight end Tanner Hudson did not participate due to a knee injury.",
