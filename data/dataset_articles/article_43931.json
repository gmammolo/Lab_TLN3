Singo D RM L. Camara MF CM Barcelona LaLiga Monaco Ligue 1 Real Madrid LaLiga Arsenal Premier League Stade Brestois Ligue 1 Reading time: minutes [Barcelona](https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona) got into trouble. Monaco celebrated the earliest dismissal in the Catalan side's continental history with Eric Garcia sent off until Lamine Yamal scored his first Champions League goal. Marc-Andre ter Stegen exceeded his confidence levels on the ball and Takumi Minamino was on hand to make it 1-0 in the goalmouth. A situation that forced the No.24 to react and leave his side a man down in the 10th minute of the match. With [Monaco](https://www.besoccer.com/team/monaco) 1-0 up and down to ten men, Lamine Yamal took the team on his back for a change. He took advantage of Marc Casado's long run to cut inside his left foot and beat Philipp Kohn at the near post. The No.19 celebrated his first Champions League appearance with the whole of the second half still to play. [September 19, 2024]",
