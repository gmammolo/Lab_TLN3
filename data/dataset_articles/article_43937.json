Quest CDC creates resilient communities and fosters social equity through collaboration and service integration, focusing on developing affordable and supportive housing for formerly homeless and extremely low-income residents in metro Atlanta. \"For more than two decades, Quest has served Atlanta's Westside with a dedicated focus on assisting the most vulnerable residents in our city,\" said Leonard L.
