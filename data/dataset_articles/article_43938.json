  "text": "- published: 14 Apr 2016 - views: 121867 Grammatical person, in [linguistics](https://wn.com/Linguistics), is the grammatical distinction between [deictic](https://wn.com/Deixis) references to participant(s) in an event; typically the distinction is between the speaker, the [addressee](https://wn.com/Addressee), and others. Grammatical person typically defines a language's set of personal [pronouns](https://wn.com/Pronoun). It also frequently affects [verbs](https://wn.com/Verb), sometimes [nouns](https://wn.com/Noun), and [possessive](https://wn.com/Genitive_case) relationships. In [Indo-European languages](https://wn.com/Indo-European_languages), first-, second-, and third-person pronouns are typically also marked for [singular](https://wn.com/Grammatical_number) and [plural](https://wn.com/Plural) forms, and sometimes [dual](https://wn.com/Dual_grammatical_number) form as well ( [grammatical number](https://wn.com/Grammatical_number)). Some languages, especially European ones, distinguish degrees of formality and informality ( [T-V distinction](https://wn.com/T-V_distinction)). Some other languages use different classifying systems, especially in the plural pronouns. One frequently found difference not present in most Indo-European languages is a contrast between [inclusive and exclusive \"we\"](https://wn.com/Inclusive_and_exclusive_we): a distinction of first-person plural pronouns between including or excluding the addressee. In the [canon law](https://wn.com/Canon_law_(Catholic_Church)) of the [Catholic Church](https://wn.com/Catholic_Church), a person is a subject of certain legal rights and obligations. The age of [reason](https://wn.com/Reason) is the [age](https://wn.com/Ageing) at which [children](https://wn.com/Children) attain the use of reason and begin to have [moral responsibility](https://wn.com/Moral_responsibility). On completion of the seventh year a [minor](https://wn.com/Minor_(law)) is presumed to have the use of reason, but [mental retardation](https://wn.com/Mental_retardation) or [insanity](https://wn.com/Insanity) prevent some individuals from ever attaining the use of reason. The term \"use of reason\" appears in the [Code of Canon Law](https://wn.com/Code_of_Canon_Law) 17 times, but \"age of reason\" does not appear. However, the term \"age of reason\" is used in canon law commentaries such as the New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law published by Paulist Press in 2002. Children who do not have the use of reason and the mentally handicapped are sometimes called \" [innocents](https://wn.com/Innocence)\" because of their inability to commit [sins](https://wn.com/Sin): even if their actions are objectively sinful, they sometimes lack capacity for subjective [guilt](https://wn.com/Culpability). In the [Eastern Catholic Churches](https://wn.com/Eastern_Catholic_Churches), the [Eucharist](https://wn.com/Eucharist) and [Confirmation](https://wn.com/Confirmation_(sacrament)) are given immediately after baptism, even to infants who do not yet have the use of reason. In [Latin Rite](https://wn.com/Latin_Rite) Catholicism, Confirmation is conferred, except in danger of death, only on persons who have the use of reason; and [Holy Communion](https://wn.com/Holy_Communion) may be administered to children only if \"they have sufficient knowledge and careful preparation so that they understand the mystery of Christ according to their capacity and are able to receive the [Body of Christ](https://wn.com/Body_of_Christ) with [faith](https://wn.com/Faith) and devotion.\" In danger of death, the Eucharist may be administered also to children who lack the use of reason, if the child can distinguish the sacrament from ordinary food and receive it reverently. This is likewise true for those who are not so mentally retarded that they are not assumed to ever gain use of reason. The concept of hypostasis as the shared existence of spiritual and corporal entities has been used in a number of religious and intellectual settings. The word hypostasis (Greek ὑπόστασις) means underlying state or underlying substance, and is the fundamental reality that supports all else. In [Neoplatonism](https://wn.com/Neoplatonism) the hypostasis of the [Soul](https://wn.com/Soul), Intellect ( [nous](https://wn.com/Nous)) and the [One](https://wn.com/Monad_(philosophy)) was addressed by [Plotinus](https://wn.com/Plotinus). In Christian theology, a hypostasis or person is one of the three elements of the [Holy Trinity](https://wn.com/Holy_Trinity). Neoplatonists argue that beneath the surface phenomena that present themselves to our senses are three higher spiritual principles or hypostases, each one more sublime than the preceding. For [Plotinus](https://wn.com/Plotinus), these are the soul, being/intellect ( [Nous](https://wn.com/Nous)), and the One. [Aristotle](https://wn.com/Aristotle) used hypostasis in reference to a material substratum underlying change in the unqualified sense of generation and corruption, and otherwise in reference to ousía or substance in a secondary sense for [genera](https://wn.com/Genus) and [species](https://wn.com/Species) understood as [hylomorphic forms](https://wn.com/Hylomorphism). Primarily, however, he used it with regard to his [category](https://wn.com/Categories_(Aristotle)) of [substance](https://wn.com/Substance_theory), the specimen (\"this person\" or \"this ox\") or [individual](https://wn.com/Identity_(philosophy)), qua individual, who survives [accidental change](https://wn.com/Accident_(philosophy)) and in whom the [essential properties](https://wn.com/Essence) inhere that define those [universals](https://wn.com/Problem_of_universals). In contrast, [Plato](https://wn.com/Plato) and later [Neoplatonism](https://wn.com/Neoplatonism), spoke of the objective reality of a thing or its [inner reality](https://wn.com/Theory_of_forms) (as opposed to outer appearance or [illusion](https://wn.com/Allegory_of_the_cave)). [Plotinus](https://wn.com/Plotinus) taught that God exists in Three Hypostases, The One, The Divine Mind and The Word-Soul. In the [Christian Scriptures](https://wn.com/New_Testament) this seems roughly its meaning at [Hebrews 1:3](http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=Hebrews+1:3&version=niv). Allied to this was its use for \"basis\" or \"foundation\" and hence also \"confidence,\" e.g., in Hebrews 3:14 and 11:1 and [2 Corinthians](https://wn.com/2_Corinthians) 9:4 and 11:17. China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a [sovereign state](https://wn.com/Sovereign_state) in [East Asia](https://wn.com/East_Asia). It is the world's [most populous country](https://wn.com/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population), with a population of over 1.35 billion. The PRC is a [one-party state](https://wn.com/One-party_state) governed by the [Communist Party](https://wn.com/Communist_Party_of_China), with its seat of government in the [capital](https://wn.com/Historical_capitals_of_China) city of [Beijing](https://wn.com/Beijing). It exercises [jurisdiction](https://wn.com/Jurisdiction) over 22 [provinces](https://wn.com/Provinces_of_China); five [autonomous regions](https://wn.com/Autonomous_regions_of_China); four [direct-controlled municipalities](https://wn.com/Direct-controlled_municipalities_of_China) (Beijing, [Tianjin](https://wn.com/Tianjin), [Shanghai](https://wn.com/Shanghai) and [Chongqing](https://wn.com/Chongqing)); two mostly self-governing [special administrative regions](https://wn.com/Special_administrative_region) ( [Hong Kong](https://wn.com/Hong_Kong) and [Macau](https://wn.com/Macau)); and claims sovereignty over [Taiwan](https://wn.com/Taiwan). Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, China is the world's [second-largest country by land area](https://wn.com/List_of_countries_and_outlying_territories_by_land_area), and either the [third or fourth-largest by total area](https://wn.com/List_of_countries_and_outlying_territories_by_total_area), depending on the method of measurement. China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from [forest steppes](https://wn.com/Mongolian-Manchurian_grassland) and the [Gobi](https://wn.com/Gobi_Desert) and [Taklamakan](https://wn.com/Taklamakan_Desert) [deserts](https://wn.com/Desert) in the arid north to [subtropical](https://wn.com/Subtropical) forests in the wetter south. The [Himalaya](https://wn.com/Himalaya), [Karakoram](https://wn.com/Karakoram), [Pamir](https://wn.com/Pamir_Mountains) and [Tian Shan](https://wn.com/Tian_Shan) mountain ranges separate China from [South](https://wn.com/South_Asia) and [Central Asia](https://wn.com/Central_Asia). The [Yangtze](https://wn.com/Yangtze_River) and [Yellow Rivers](https://wn.com/Yellow_River), the third- and sixth-longest in the world, run from the [Tibetan Plateau](https://wn.com/Tibetan_Plateau) to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometres (9,000 mi) long, and is bounded by the [Bohai](https://wn.com/Bohai_Sea), [Yellow](https://wn.com/Yellow_Sea), [East](https://wn.com/East_China_Sea) and [South China Seas](https://wn.com/South_China_Sea). João Pedro dos Santos Gonçalves (born 15 April 1982 in [Beja](https://wn.com/Beja,_Portugal)), known as China, is a Portuguese professional [footballer](https://wn.com/Association_football) who plays for Cypriot club [Nea Salamis Famagusta FC](https://wn.com/Nea_Salamis_Famagusta_FC) as a [left back](https://wn.com/Defender_(association_football)). |RADIO STATION||GENRE||LOCATION| | | Courses on Khan Academy are always 100% free.
