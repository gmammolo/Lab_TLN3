  "text": "By Adam Holt ,\n2 hours ago\nThe Green Bay Packers are looking to get to 2-1 in Week 3 against the Tennessee Titans. If they want to do that, they will need to succeed on the ground once again.\nJosh Jacobs dominated in Week 2 with Malik Willis at quarterback. Jordan Love may return for the matchup against Tennessee, but we won't know that until ninety minutes before kickoff, according to head coach Matt LaFleur.\nRegardless, Jacobs just received some extra motivation to have an impressive outing against a Titans rushing defense that has allowed 92.5 yards per game in two games this season.\nJeffery Simmons doubts Packers' run game Simmons said that nobody runs the ball on the Tennessee Titans.\nIs he actually correct , though?\nThe New York Jets averaged around 4.5 yards per carry against the Titans last weekend. In Week 1, Tennessee did play the run a bit better. Chicago Bears starting running back Deandre Swift averaged just three yards per carry on ten carries.\nTennessee has the talent on the defensive line to slow down the Packers running game, but you can argue that Green Bay has had the best rushing attack in football through two weeks of play.\nThey're averaging 212 rushing yards per game, and Jacobs looks fresh in their offense. Emanuel Wilson has been efficient for GB, too. He's averaging 6.1 YPC so far this season. He deserves the clear backup role for the Packers.\nNo matter what - Jacobs is the X-Factor for the Pack in Week 3. He's breaking off chunk plays better than any other RB in the league, and that needs to play a factor this Sunday against the Titans.\nNow, the recent disrespect from a top Titans talent may raise his standards for himself in this matchup even more.\nRelated: How to watch, stream, and listen to Green Bay Packers at Tennessee Titans in week 3\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
