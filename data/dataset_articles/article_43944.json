  "text": "By Ian Valentino ,\n2 hours ago\nThe 2024 Ohio State Buckeyes certainly aren't hurting for talent. With two commanding wins in the book and another certain victory in Week 4, the Buckeyes are loaded. No one can complain about the team's ability to replace three key departed playmakers from last year's team.\nWide receiver Julian Fleming and running backs Chip Trayanum and Dallan Hayden had moments of brilliance while with the Buckeyes. Most of their best moments came in 2022.\nWhether it was Hayden's combined 248 yards against Indiana and Maryland in 2022, Trayanum's 83 yards against Michigan that season, or Fleming's solid outings against Iowa, Michigan, and Georgia, these three were major parts of the offense. Let's see how each has done in their new homes.\nDallan Hayden, Colorado Hayden fled to Colorado, which seemed like a promising place for him to see the field and play a ton. A talented runner who can effectively find space, Hayden hasn't lived up to expectations for Coach Prime. Injuries have played a part, as he'll likely be out again in Week 4.\nWith only 14 carries for 52 yards and three receptions for 41 yards, Hayden has been a major disappointment thus far. Ohio State hasn't needed him, and he'd likely be behind James Peoples anyway, but it's an unfortunate start to his career in Boulder, and he could be looking for a new home again this winter.",
