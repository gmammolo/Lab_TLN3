  "text": "By Tyler Forness ,\n2 hours ago\nThe Minnesota Vikings have a winner in defensive coordinator Brian Flores. He has been a renaissance with his defensive scheme in helping elevate a poor unit into the top half of the league in 2023 and things look even better in 2024.\nFlores used a lot of different three edge rusher packages in 2023 and has taken that one step further in 2024 with even more confusion and players who are smart enough to handle it.\nJason McCourty talks Brian Flores' brilliant scheme NFL Live has done a great job recently talking about scheme on their show and breaking plays down. Former quarterback Dan Orlovsky and former Flores cornerback Jason McCourty break down how the Vikings can do anything out of the same look because of their player's intelligence.\n\"And what's most impressive about this,\" said McCourty, \"you can only do this if you have smart players, because you just said it looks just like the last one. In order for it to look like that, you have to be matched up with a guy, man-to-man. So the only way Brock Purdy's going to believe it, Stephon Gilmore can't be standing over a running back if he's out here. You have to match...\"\n\"Personel wise,\" said Orlovsky.\n\"Yes,\" said McCourty. \"And now he has to know if I'm the guy here, and Harrison Smith is here now, I've become a safety play in the half-field, and Harrison Smith is now playing cornerback in the flat. So at all of these positions, we have Josh Metellus a DB running through as a middle linebacker. You have to be able to play all the different spots in cover to Tampa to be able to run.\"\nFor context, here are the two looks the Vikings used in their two games this season.\n&commatdanorlovsky7 on Twitter&solX\n&commatdanorlovsky7 on Twitter&solX",
