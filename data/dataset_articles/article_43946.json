The actor has signed his ambitious and challenging project #Sharwa38 that will be directed by Blockbuster Maker Sampath Nandi who is known for making commercial entertainers in his trademark style. KK Radhamohan will be producing the movie prestigiously on a high budget with rich production and technical standards on Sri Sathya Sai Arts as Production No. 15, with Lakshmi Radhamohan presenting it. It's a pulsating period action drama set in the rural backdrop of North Telangana, on Telangana-Maharashtra border, in the late 1960s, which was rarely explored on Indian celluloid. The story unfolds in a world ruled by fear where blood becomes the answer to many problems. #Sharwa38 will be a raw and intense narrative with gripping action and emotionally charged sequences. It will be a hatke and first-of-its-kind film from Sampath Nandi and Sharwa with a story and elements never told and discussed before on the silver screen. Given the subject’s universal appeal, they are making it at Pan India level, which is a first for both Sharwa and Sampath Nandi. The director who has been working on the story for some time will be presenting Sharwa in a never-before-seen character, and the actor will be undergoing a remarkable makeover to play the character from the 60s. The announcement poster shows fire erupting in a waste land. #Sharwa38 will boast exceptional technical standards with some top-tier technicians on board. Soundar Rajan S who is selective will crank the camera, while the sensational composer Bheems Ceciroleo will provide the music. Kiran Kumar Manne is the art director. The ensemble cast and other prominent technicians to work on this most awaited movie will be revealed soon. #Sharwa38 will be released in Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, and Hindi languages.",
