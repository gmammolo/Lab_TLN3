  "text": "By Kelsey Kramer ,\n2 hours ago\nFormer Bulldogs Georgia star safety Javon Bullard is transitioning well at the NFL level.\nAs a rookie starter for the Green Bay Packers, Bullard has been credited with 12 total tackles and one pass breakup through two weeks so far. He's also allowed just three receptions and has missed one tackle.\nFollowing his Week 2 performance against the Indianapolis Colts where he logged five tackles and a pass breakup, Pro Football Focus gave him a grade of 78.3 -- the highest of any rookie safety from that week.\nBullard, a two-time national champion at Georgia, went 58th overall to the Packers back in April.\nHe entered the NFL fresh off a 2023 season with the Dawgs where he did not allow a single touchdown and forced seven incompletions.\nAt 5-foot-11 and 198 pounds, Bullard is a lot smaller than your average NFL safety, but his size hasn't stopped him from making those physical plays.\nGeorgia head coach Kirby Smart once referred to him as a \"little stick of dynamite\" and \"fearless\" after he posted a two-sack performance against the Tennessee Vols during the 2022 season.\n“He’s like a little stick of dynamite,\" Smart said.\"...He’s physical and he’s passionate about playing the game.”\nIt was after that same game that Smart explained exactly what it was Georiga saw in the former 3-star undersized prospect from Milledgeville, GA when they were recruiting him back in 2021.\n\"His film showed the toughness, he tackled well,” Smart said. “You can tell people who run through tackles don’t fear contact, and he was a fearless player.\"",
