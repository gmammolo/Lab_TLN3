  "text": "Loris Cabirou led the way in the final of two Lamborghini Super Trofeo North America practice sessions at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Thursday, edging out Ryan Norman by a mere 0.008 seconds in a session that saw multiple red flag stoppages. The ANSA Motorsports driver set his benchmark 1:25.516 lap time early in the session aboard the No. 30 Lamborghini Huracan Super Trofeo EVO2 he shares with Bryson Morris. His time held firm, despite multiple challenges from Norman and Danny Formal’s Wayne Taylor Racing with Andretti entry. Scott Huffaker was third-quickest in the No. 22 WorldSpeed Lamborghini, despite bringing out the first of two red flags when he went off at Turn 4 early in the session. ANSA’s Nico Jamin managed to record the session’s fourth fastest time before teammate Kiko Porto found the Turn 4 runoff, bringing the second red. The Pro-Am No. 66 Forty7 Motorsports entry of Joel Miller rounded out the top-five. Cole Kleck was once-again quickest in Am, with Rocky T. Bolduc holding a commanding margin over the rest of his LB Cup competitors. The exit of Turn 6 proved troublesome for many of the drivers as they increased their pace in second practice, with race control issuing 24 track limits warnings and penalties for violations at the corner during the 45-minute session. Qualifying is scheduled to begin at 10:20 a.m. EDT tomorrow morning, with Race 1 going green at 4:00 p.m. EDT later that afternoon featuring live streaming coverage on Peacock and IMSA.tv.
