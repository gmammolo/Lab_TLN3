  "text": "The FSU baseball team is looking to build off their trip to the College World Series last season and will have one of the best prospects in the country.\nMLB Pipeline announced their top 20 college prospects in the 2025 MLB draft this week and Jaime Arnold was named their No. 4 prospect. He was their top left-handed pitcher and No. 2 pitcher overall. Here is what Jim Callis had to say about Arnold.\nArnold misses a ton of bats with his fastball, which sits at 93-95 mph and touches 97 with plenty of carry from a low arm slot and flat approach angle, and his sweeping 82-85 mph slider. He hasn’t employed his changeup much but didn’t need it while logging a 2.98 ERA with a 159/26 K/BB ratio in 105 2/3 innings as a sophomore.\nArnold emerged as one of the best pitchers in the country as a sophomore and was a first-team All-American from Perfect Game, D1Baseball, the NCBWA, and ABCA and a second-team choice of Baseball America.\nHis 159 strikeouts were fifth in program history and the most since Paul Wilson – the No. 1 overall pick in the 1994 MLB Draft – struck out 163 in 1994. Arnold’s 11 wins are the most for a Seminole since 2012, while his 17 strikeouts at Pittsburgh on May 10 were the most at Florida State since 1987.\nFSU is set to play a three-game fall schedule starting on Oct. 12. They are set to play the Auburn Tigers and Alabama Crimson Tide and will conclude it with their annual Garnet and Gold game on Nov. 1.\nContact/Follow us @ FSUWire on X (Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Auburn news, notes, and opinions.
