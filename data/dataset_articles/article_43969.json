  "text": "Local jazz orchestra Swingin’ Door Big Band will perform at Door County Gala, 1023 Egg Harbor Road in Sturgeon Bay, on Sept. 26, 7 pm.\nA $5 cover charge will benefit the group’s summer band camp scholarship program. Refreshments will be available for purchase.\n“We will hit all the high notes, including charts by Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman,” Swingin’ Door Big Band director Jason Palmer said. “I’m sure the audience will recognize many of the great tunes from the big band era.”\nThe band features 25 musicians, including Company B, a female vocal trio that covers Andrews Sisters’ charts like “Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy” and “Don’t Sit Under the Apple Tree.” Company B members Mary Hall, Kristin Malnory and Jamie Palmer will each perform a solo, and trumpeter Mark Fischer will perform Frank Sinatra’s “You Make Me Feel So Young.”\nFunds raised by the Swingin’ Door Big Band provide summer band camp scholarships for Door County middle and high school students. In spring 2024, the band funded ten scholarships.",
