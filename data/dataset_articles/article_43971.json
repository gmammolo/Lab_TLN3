  "text": "A peek at preliminary annual population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau for Door County municipalities shows the county continuing to grow, particularly in the northern portion of the county and in the City of Sturgeon Bay. Given the boom in housing and apartment construction in Sturgeon Bay and Sister Bay, it’s not surprising those communities are seeing some of the largest population gains. The Town of Egg Harbor, where several apartment buildings have been built, added 81 people, and the Village of Egg Harbor has nearly doubled its population since 2010, growing from 201 residents to 387. With 819 more residents since the 2020 Census – when the resident population grew 8.2%, or 2,281 people, since 2010 – the county has now added 3,100 residents since 2010, an 11% increase. The county hasn’t grown so rapidly since the 1970s, when the county added 4,923 residents in 10 years, then grew by only 2,756 people from 1980 to 2010. Graphic illustration by Eleanor Corbin.
