  "text": "HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - A new chapter in affordable housing is unfolding in Downtown Honolulu for young professionals. The first office-to-residential conversion under the city’s Bill 7 program is now complete, providing a much-needed option for those seeking affordable rentals. The newly opened building at 1060 Bishop Street adds 52 affordable units into Oahu’s housing stock. It also signals a continuing gradual transformation of the downtown from a place to work -- to a place to live. The building offers a variety of units for residents earning 80% or less of the area median income. “This was an existing building beforehand,” said Luke Williams of 1060 Bishop Street. “We gutted it completely, added new plumbing stacks and whatever is needed into an old office building, and now it’s a residential building.” ”We’re grateful for the opportunity to contribute to finding solutions to Hawaii’s affordable housing crisis through this new project,” said Robert Kurisu, principal of 1060 Bishop Street, LLC. “This project aims to address a critical need in our community by repurposing an existing structure for much-needed housing in the heart of Honolulu and revitalize our downtown community.” The project was built under Bill 7, which is meant to spur developers to build more affordable housing. “Incentives include real property tax exemptions and GET (general excise tax) exemptions, which ultimately allow the developer to pass along the savings to residents,” said Kurisu. Another incentive for developers until Bill 7 -- they don’t have to include parking, which, according to national trends, isn’t a problem for young urban dwellers. “They are looking to not have to drive, especially young people under 35. They want to have all of their entertainment within a five-block radius,” said real estate expert Stephany Sofos. “They’ll bike to the gym, they’ll bike to the beach, but that’s it,” she added. “After or on the weekends it’s pretty dead, it’s pretty dormant, it’s pretty quiet,” said City Council Member Tyler Dos Santos-Tam, who represents the area. “So to have residents down there who are going to patronize the coffee shops and the restaurants and help bring new energy in -- that’s super important.” A lot of the transformation is happening on Bishop Street, which is still the center of Hawaii’s financial district. But the area now includes the AC Hotel Honolulu, on the corner of Hotel Street. There’s also the 22-story Davies Pacific Center, which is being transformed into a mixed used condo called “Modea.” It will have 352 units ranging from $400,000 studios to three-bedrooms units starting at $1 million. The reduction in available office space isn’t a bad thing, according to Sofos. “At one point they were about 25 percent vacant,” she said. ‘Now with these buildings being taken out, the inventory’s gotten smaller, so people are getting into these office buildings faster.” 1060 Bishop Street includes 52 units, with studios ranging from 281 to 391 square feet for $1,950 per month. One-bedroom units range from 372 to 581 square feet, starting at $2,089 per month, while two-bedroom units are 791 square feet and rent for $2,506 per month. Utilities are included, and a discounted TV and high-speed internet package is available for an additional fee. Applications for studio, one and two bedroom apartments are being accepted now.
