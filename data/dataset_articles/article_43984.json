  "text": "The Hudson Companies and St. Nicks Alliance on Wednesday, in collaboration with the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), broke ground on the second phase of Kingsland Commons, a transformation of the former Greenpoint Hospital campus into an affordable housing complex. Designed by Magnusson Architecture and Planning (MAP) and Architecture Outfit , this phase includes an 18-story building with 311 permanently affordable units for extremely low- and very low-income residents, including formerly homeless individuals and families.\nCredit: Julienne Schaer The groundbreaking at the 3.4-acre site in East Williamsburg, located at 288 Jackson Street, comes after Hudson Companies and St. Nicks secured $235 million in funding in July for the project’s construction.\n“In transforming a historic former hospital campus into a vibrant community of affordable housing, retail, and community services, Kingsland Commons is a prime example of what our city needs more of–developments that not only provide homes but make a positive impact on the neighborhood for generations to come,” Ernesto Padron, development director of Hudson Companies, said.\n“As we officially begin the second phase of redevelopment at Kingsland Commons, we look forward to soon welcoming 311 new families, including those who are formerly homeless, to our growing community.”\nConstructed in 1915, the Renaissance-Revival-style hospital was established to serve accident victims from nearby factories. During the city’s financial crisis in the 1980s, the hospital closed, except for one building, the Barbara S. Kleinman Residence, which continues to house homeless New Yorkers.\nIn the 1990s, four auxiliary buildings were redeveloped as affordable housing, and the city converted a fifth building into the Greenpoint Renaissance Center a few years later. In 2017, HPD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the site to address the needs of its residents.\nIn September 2018, HPD announced it would work with HPD, St. Nicks, the Hudson Companies, and Project Renewal on revitalizing the site.\nThe first phase of the project included the relocation of the existing 200-bed shelter into a rehabilitated building with 267 units on vacant land, and the construction of the Greenpoint Hospital site located south of Skillman Avenue.\nThe 54,000-square-foot facility is being converted in partnership with the state’s Historic Preservation Office to preserve its historic facade and character, restore various indoor elements, and install modern building systems, finishes, and landscaping. Construction on the first phase is led by Broadway Builders and is slated for completion in 2025.\nSituated directly next to the project’s first phase, the 311 residences created in the second phase will be available to low-income individuals and families earning between 30 and 80 percent of the area median income . Additionally, 93 units will be set aside for formerly homeless individuals.\nThe apartment building will include a range of studios, one, two, and three bedrooms, and feature an outdoor courtyard and playground, a rooftop terrace, laundry room, fitness center, bike storage, a children’s playroom, and a tenants’ lounge.\nBroadway Builders is also leading construction on the second phase, with completion slated for 2027.\nOnce the fourth and final phase is complete, the project will rehabilitate and transform two existing buildings, construct two new buildings with roughly 557 affordable homes, a 200-bed men’s shelter, a health clinic, a senior center, a workforce development center, a cafe, and public open space.\nRELATED:\nPlans revealed to convert abandoned hospital in Greenpoint into affordable housing complex City will convert long-vacant Greenpoint Hospital into hundreds of affordable housing units 1,000 new affordable homes for NYCHA seniors coming to Central Brooklyn",
