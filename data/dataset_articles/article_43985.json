  "text": "Converted industrial spaces often lack the warmth of other types of pre-war properties. This fourth-floor loft at 176 Duane Street , asking $5,600,000, is wrapped in warm wood and natural brick, with a wood-burning fireplace and burnished wood floors. Built in the 1800s and used as a spice and coffee grinding factory, the Neo-Grec building in the Tribeca West Historic District–just across from Duane Park–was converted to lofts in 1999. The two-bedroom loft doesn’t sacrifice warmth for loft luxuries like open spaces and soaring ceilings.\nThe heart of this 2,336-square-foot apartment is a sprawling great room beneath 10-foot-high beamed ceilings. A massive fireplace anchors one side of the room. Windows overlook the city’s second-oldest park.\nTall loft windows provide views of the historic neighborhood. A well-designed kitchen blends natural, organic materials with clean industrial details. Hard-working supersized appliances fit the big-shouldered proportions of the space. Exposed pipes accent the kitchen, and track lighting gives individual living and dining areas top billing.\nInternal walls form a hallway, along which internal rooms are cleverly divided by sliding panels of steel and tinted privacy glass. A cozy home office and den could also be used as bedrooms or guest rooms.\nThe two main bedrooms have convenient pocket doors. The larger of the two boasts a walk-in-closet. Bathrooms are luxuriously appointed with modern comforts and plenty of space and storage. There is a washer/dryer in the unit as well.\nWith a retail base, the elevator building contains only five full-floor loft apartments. In addition to the adjacent park, the surrounding district offers a spot in the heart of one of the city’s most iconic loft neighborhoods.\n[Listing details: 176 Duane Street, #4 at CityRealty ]\n[At Douglas Elliman by Karan Chopra ]\nRELATED:\nGaze at the sun, moon, and stars above from this $5.45M Tribeca penthouse Love is a large, lovely $2.9M Lispenard Street loft For $3.1M, an authentic condo loft in a Tribeca landmark Designed by Shigeru Ban, this $12M Tribeca penthouse glows atop a historic neighborhood landmark",
