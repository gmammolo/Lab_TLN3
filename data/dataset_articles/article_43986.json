  "text": "An Oakville father of two is celebrating his first big lottery win.\nAndrew O matched the last six of seven Encore numbers in exact order in the Ontario 49 draw on November 18, 2023, to win $100,000.\nSaying yes to Encore paid off big time for the Oakville dad.\n“When I had my ticket validated, I was in disbelief and froze! It was quite a surreal moment,” said Andrew, who has been playing the lottery with OLG for about five years. “When I told my mother, she was shocked!\n“All my family and friends were filled with joy when I shared the news.”\nThe 51-year-old father says he enjoys playing Ontario 49 and Lotto 6/49 whether he’s choosing his own numbers or using OLG’s Quick Pick feature to make his selections.\nAndrew plans to save and invest his winnings.\n“I feel extremely lucky and fortunate,” said Andrew while visiting the OLG Prize Centre in Toronto to pick up his winnings. “I can’t explain this feeling. It’s such a unique experience!”\nThe winning ticket was purchased at Canadian Tire Gas+ on Dundas Street East in Oakville.",
