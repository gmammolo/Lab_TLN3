  "text": "The No. 20 Kentucky women’s soccer team began the season with eight straight victories, riding into conference play undefeated on the year.\nKentucky women's soccer makes history, improves to 8-0 for first time ever PHOTOS: Kentucky Womens Soccer wins 3-1 over Kent State. Kentucky women's soccer seeks to continue dominant season against Kent State Kentucky women's soccer records statement 2-0 victory over No. 9 UCLA Now looking at the SEC, the Cats play Florida in their next game, which will be a crucial test as they get into a gauntlet of a conference.\nKentucky has an opportunity to extend its winning streak given its current form and stellar defensive record, but the SEC opposition will certainly be dangerous.\nKentucky forwards Makala Woods, Alexis Tylenda, and Maddie Kemp celebrate a goal during the Kentucky vs. Kent State women’s soccer game on Friday, Sept. 13, 2024, at Wendell and Vickie Bell soccer complex in Lexington, Kentucky. Kentucky won 3-1. Photo by Sydney Yonker | Staff After Florida, South Carolina steps up and the Gamecocks are a powerful opponent, particularly when playing at home. They’ve played well against Kentucky in the past and have a strong defensive squad including former Cat Anna Young.\nSamantha Chang is a vital member of the Gamecocks’ midfield, a powerful player noted for her leadership and playmaking skills.\nAfter that, Georgia will present Kentucky with yet another important challenge as the Bulldogs are a well-rounded team that features a mix of young and seasoned players.\nDepending on the state of both teams when that match arrives, it’s certainly expected to be a competitive game, but Kentucky has a high chance to win if it can maintain offensive pressure and midfield possession.\nFollowing the home stand against Georgia, Kentucky will face off with a brand new face in the SEC as Oklahoma joined the conference in the offseason. Although Kentucky has more experience and is currently playing better than Oklahoma, the Sooners have shown potential in their last few games.\nElla Pappas is Oklahoma’s leading scorer and she’s capable of both creating and finishing scoring opportunities.\nAll in all, Kentucky’s women have a strong chance to keep winning in these next few match ups, but now that conference play has arrived, any team on any night can strike and change that.\nNo. 20 Kentucky will face off against Florida tonight, Sept. 19, at the Wendell & Vickie Bell Soccer Complex with kickoff scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET. The contest will air live on ESPN+.",
