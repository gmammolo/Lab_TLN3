  "text": "A decade of construction on homes for thousands of Gold Coast residents is underway at Lewis Land’s Harbour Shores community. Greyburn Building Contractors is forging ahead with construction of the project’s first stage with 40 per cent of the first two residential collections already sold. Don’t miss the Developing Queensland section, every Saturday in The Courier-Mail The vacant 16ha site has been held by Lewis Land for more than 40 years and will be transformed into a village of villages, which will become home to more than 4000 people. Located across the road from Lewis Land’s Harbour Town, Harbour Shores has access to the retail, dining and events precinct, as well as amenities to be developed on site, including a new community parkland and public boardwalk. Lewis Land directors Marnie Lewis-Millar and Shay Lewis-Thorp said the group had a long history of creating vibrant and innovative communities, especially on the northern end of the Gold Coast. “Projects such as The Sovereign Islands, Ephraim Island, Runaway Islands and Harbour Town Shopping Centre stand as testament to our commitment to this city,” Ms Lewis-Millar said. “Harbour Shores represents the largest and most dynamic community development in Lewis Land’s 65-year history, delivering architectural homes and apartments immersed in nature and world-class amenities adjoining the Harbour Town shopping precinct.” Designed by BDA architects, Harbour Shores will evolve over the next decade to deliver a mix of apartments and villas, communal open spaces and parklands, a 1.2km waterfront boardwalk, private marina berths, and resort-style amenities for residents. The masterplan has received a 6 Star Green Star Communities rating from the Green Building Council of Australia, making it the most sustainable development in the history of the Gold Coast. Lewis Land chief executive Brett Draffen said the project would deliver the most sustainable homes on the Gold Coast and create up to 5000 construction jobs over the next 10 years. “From the outset, we assembled a first-class team of architects, landscape designers, planners and placemaking experts and set an ambitious sustainability goal for Harbour Shores to become the group’s first completely fossil-fuel free development,” he said. “Over 200,000 new native and tropical plants will immerse the residential spaces in nature, while rainwater harvesting and retention tanks, solar power, and electric vehicle charging stations will ensure Harbour Shores is built for the future. “More than 40 per cent of the first release is already under contract and based on the current timeline, the first residents will be welcomed to Harbour Shores in mid-2026.” The first residential releases at Harbour Shores include the apartment collection The Waterline and a collection of waterfront villas known as The Residences, connected by landscaping, green spaces and pedestrian networks. Apartments within The Waterline, which enjoys water and park views, start from $1.22m for a two-bedroom apartment and $1.62m for a three-bedroom apartment. The collection of three and four-bedroom waterfront villas at The Residences, each with their own private plunge pools, are priced from $3.05m. Harbour Shores is being marketed by Colliers International.
