  "text": "- September 27, 2024 Loading On the Sept. 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance, more than 235 volunteer members from [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng), spanning more than 13 different local congregations in West Orange, gathered in honor of that day to serve the local community. Volunteer members provided more than 700 hours of service at nine different nonprofits in the area, including the Christian Service Center in Ocoee, Habitat for Humanity in Winter Garden, the Oakland Nature Preserve, Hope Center in Winter Garden and Special Hearts Farm in Winter Garden. “We are thankful to join with other people of goodwill in service to God and our community on this special day of remembrance,” said Stake President Gary Hansen, who oversees 13 of The Church's congregations in and around the Horizon West area. “It was really meaningful to be a part of the 9/11 National Day of Service,\" said Jackson Bratt, 15, who worked as a volunteer trimming back weeds and sticks at the Oakland Nature Preserve. \"I think it’s important to get out and serve in our community so we can give back.”",
