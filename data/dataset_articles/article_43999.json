  "text": "AUBURN, Ala. – Proceeds from Auburn’s men’s basketball exhibition vs. Florida Atlantic Nov. 1 at Neville Arena will benefit Auburn University’s Melton Scholars Program, an initiative close to the heart of head coach\nBruce Pearl.\n“I tell my guys: there are going to be roadblocks, obstacles and detours, but you can navigate them and be anything you want to be,” Pearl said. “Auburn can help you do that. I believe that Auburn is a place where anybody can be successful.”\nLaunched in 2023, the Melton Scholars Program increases access for underrepresented students and supports them throughout their Auburn experience.\nNamed in honor of 1988 Auburn graduate Harold Melton, the former Chief Justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, Auburn’s first Black student body president and the namesake of the university’s Student Center, the program empowers students to thrive academically, socially and personally.\nThe initial cohort of 11 Melton Scholars enrolled in the fall of 2023 with nine students receiving $10,000 annually for four years.\n“Our basketball student-athletes are on full scholarships,\" Pearl said. \"I made sure my players and their families knew we really wanted them, and we were committed to them graduating. That’s the way you have to recruit first-generation students or students of color. Recruit, retain and invest in them.”",
