[Image credit: WWE.com] The Rock has been one of the most influential WWE figures over the past two decades. Recently, Mia Yim, aka Michin, detailed her heartfelt interaction with The People's Champion and stated how she was influenced by him.\n2024 was a breakout year for Mia Yim as she became a notable face in the women's division on WWE SmackDown. Regardless of her loss at Saturday Night's Main Event, Michin hasn't given up on her dream of winning championship gold in 2025.\nIn an interview with The Wrestling Classic , the 35-year-old star detailed how The People's Champion influenced her while growing up to become a wrestler. Moreover, Yim explained that she got a chance to express her gratitude to The Final Boss and he took time to talk to her and gave her advice:\nTrending \"Yes, when I could get through some. When I could get through the tears, I told him, 'You changed my life. You're the reason why I started watching wrestling in the first place,' and he was so sweet. So many people wanted to pull him left or right; they were trying to pull him everywhere, but he took the time to actually listen to me and give me advice. People say do not meet your heroes, but everybody that I met that I always wanted to meet has always been super sweet and respectful. And it was just like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm a bigger fan now just meeting you,'\" Michin said. (From 02:28 to 03:12) New Champs in WWE! More RIGHT HERE\nCheck out the video below:",
