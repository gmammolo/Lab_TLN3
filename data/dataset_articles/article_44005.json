  "text": "Riding a four-game winning streak, the Los Angeles Rams are playing some of their best football as they close in on a possible NFC West title. The Rams will aim to maintain their impressive form Saturday night against the Arizona Cardinals in Inglewood, Calif. Los Angeles (9-6) is coming off a 19-9 road win over the New York Jets last week in freezing temperatures after trailing 9-6 entering the fourth quarter while being outgained by nearly 100 yards. The Rams matched their largest margin of victory this season. They have won eight of 10 games since their bye week, when they were 1-4. \"You don't want to ride the emotional roller coaster that these games can take you on,\" Los Angeles coach Sean McVay said this week about persevering through the early-season struggles. \"You do have the ability to stay steady, to stay the course and try to right the ship. \"Certainly that's not complete by any stretch, but our guys have done an excellent job of not allowing the way that we started, especially in those first five games, to affect what we did coming off that bye.\" The Rams have clinched their seventh winning record in eight regular seasons under McVay. The franchise endured 13 consecutive non-winning seasons before McVay took over in 2017, when he was only 31 years old. A productive running game led by Kyren Williams has provided support for quarterback Matthew Stafford during the Rams' winning run in December. Williams, a Pro Bowl selection last season, has a career-high 1,243 yards and 13 rushing touchdowns on 303 carries following his 122-yard game against New York. Arizona (7-8), which has dropped four of its past five games, was eliminated from playoff contention with a 36-30 overtime loss to the host Carolina Panthers last week. The Cardinals may have to play their last two games without running back James Conner, who came out in the third quarter last week with a knee injury after producing 117 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries. Arizona coach Jonathan Gannon said on Monday that Conner wants to continue playing despite his injury and the Cardinals' out-of-contention status. \"If they're healthy enough to play, they'll play,\" Gannon said in general of his injured players. \"We're gonna play who we think gives us the best chance to win.\" Conner has never played a full season in his eight years in the NFL, missing at least one game due to injury each year. He has a career-high 1,090 rushing yards. His 410 receiving yards are close to his career-high total of 497 set in 2018. Right tackle Jonah Williams and left tackle Paris Johnson Jr. were both placed on injured reserve Tuesday due to knee ailments. Arizona quarterback Kyler Murray completed 20 of 32 pass attempts for 202 yards with one touchdown and an interception in the loss at Carolina. Murray also rushed eight times for 63 yards and a TD. Conner was his top receiver with 49 yards on four receptions. Gannon plans to play Murray in the last two games. The Cardinals close with a home game with the San Francisco 49ers next week. \"He gives us the best chance to win,\" Gannon said. \"He's gonna play.\" Arizona safety Joey Blount (ribs) and cornerback Elijah Jones (ankle) did not practice Wednesday, while Conner was limited. For the Rams, right tackle Rob Havenstein (shoulder) was the only player on the Wednesday injury report. He was listed as limited in practice. --Field Level Media\nRams on rise entering matchup with hurting Cardinals\n- Field Level Media\n- Updated\nToday's Weather\nRight Now\n48°\n- Humidity: 67%\n- Cloud Coverage: 74%\n- Wind: 22 mph\n- UV Index: 0 Low\n- Sunrise: 07:30:13 AM\n- Sunset: 04:06:22 PM\nToday\nWindy with periods of light rain.
