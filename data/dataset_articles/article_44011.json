Versatile : Works as a side dish for any main course, from roast chicken to ham or even a casual burger night. Ingredients The full printable recipe card with measurements and instructions is found at the bottom of the post.\nFrozen diced hash browns : These are the base of the dish and save you time by skipping the peeling and chopping. Thaw them out in the fridge for a few hours before you use them in the recipe. Yellow onions : Add a bit of sweetness and texture to balance the creamy sauce. Melted butter : Gives the dish richness and helps everything bake to perfection. Cheddar cheese : The star of the show, adding that irresistible cheesy goodness. We like old cheddar in our house! Cream of chicken soup : Acts as a creamy binder and infuses the dish with savory flavor. Don’t add any water. Sour cream : Adds tanginess and creaminess to the potatoes. Onion salt : Enhances the flavors and gives a subtle hint of extra onion taste. Pepper : A touch of seasoning to balance the richness. Fresh chives : Sprinkle them in for a pop of color and a mild oniony flavor. If you don’t have chives, you could also use chopped green onion. How to Make Party Potatoes Follow along to learn how to make party potatoes.\nStep One: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Step Two: Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl. Spread the mixture in a 9×13-inch baking dish. Step Three: Bake for 1 hour, uncovered. Step Four: Turn the oven to broil on low. Broil for 1 minute or until the top starts to brown. Watch it carefully, as it will burn quickly! I like to do this so the top is nice and golden. You can skip this step if you want. Step Five: Remove from oven and serve hot. If you have any leftover chives, add them to the top for extra garnish and flavor. Shop Recommended Products!

Perfect for holiday dinners or Sunday supper. Ham or Pork Tenderloin : The cheesy richness of the potatoes balances the smoky, savory notes of ham or tenderloin. Grilled or Baked Fish : Lighten up your plate with a flaky, buttery fish like salmon or cod alongside these hearty potatoes. Steak or Meatloaf : Whether it’s a juicy grilled steak or a classic comfort food meatloaf, Party Potatoes add a creamy, indulgent touch. BBQ Dishes : Ribs, pulled pork, or grilled chicken all pair wonderfully with these potatoes for a casual, crowd-pleasing meal. Vegetarian Options : Serve alongside a veggie-packed casserole or grilled portobello mushrooms for a satisfying vegetarian dinner. Salads : A fresh green salad or a tangy coleslaw provides a nice contrast to the richness of the potatoes. Variations and Substitutions Switch Up the Cheese : Try swapping the cheddar for Monterey Jack, mozzarella, or a blend of your favorites for a different cheesy flavor. Add a Crunchy Topping : Sprinkle crushed potato chips, panko breadcrumbs, or buttered cornflakes on top before baking for a crispy finish. Make It Spicy : Add a kick with diced jalapeños, a dash of cayenne pepper, or some chopped green chilies. Go Vegetarian : Replace the cream of chicken soup with cream of mushroom or cream of celery soup for a vegetarian-friendly version. Lighten It Up : Use reduced-fat sour cream, light cheese, or a smaller amount of butter to make a lighter version without sacrificing too much flavor. Herb It Up : Experiment with fresh herbs like parsley, thyme, or dill for a unique twist. Add Protein : Mix in cooked, crumbled bacon, diced ham, or even shredded chicken to turn this side dish into a hearty main course. Use Fresh Potatoes : If you prefer, peel and dice fresh potatoes instead of using frozen hash browns—just make sure to parboil them first. Storage Instructions Refrigerating Leftovers : Allow the Party Potatoes to cool completely, then transfer them to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. Reheating : Warm leftovers in the oven at 350°F until heated, about 15-20 minutes. You can also reheat individual portions in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between. Freezing : For longer storage, you can freeze the potatoes. Wrap the baking dish tightly with plastic wrap and aluminum foil, or transfer the potatoes to a freezer-safe container. Freeze for up to 2 months. Reheating from Frozen : Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then bake at 350°F until heated through, about 30-40 minutes. To keep the top crispy, broil for a minute or two at the end. Make Ahead Instructions Party Potatoes are perfect for prepping in advance, saving you time on busy days or before a big gathering.\nPrepare the Dish : Assemble the casserole as directed, but don’t bake it yet. Cover the dish tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Bake When Ready : Remove the dish from the fridge about 30 minutes before baking to let it come to room temperature. This ensures even cooking. Then, bake as directed, adding a few extra minutes if needed. Recipe Tips and Tricks Thaw the Hash Browns : Make sure the frozen hash browns are fully thawed and patted dry to prevent excess moisture from making the dish soggy. Shred Your Own Cheese : For the best melt and flavor, shred your own cheese instead of using pre-shredded cheese, which can contain anti-caking agents. Mix Thoroughly : Stir all the ingredients well to ensure the flavors are evenly distributed throughout the dish. Keep an Eye While Broiling : The broiling step adds a beautiful golden top, but it can go from perfectly browned to burnt in seconds. Stay close and watch it carefully. Use Fresh Chives for Garnish : Sprinkle fresh chives on top after baking for a pop of color and an extra layer of flavor. Double the Recipe for a Crowd : Feeding a large group? This recipe is easy to double—just use a bigger dish or bake in two separate pans. Customize to Your Taste : Don’t be afraid to tweak the seasoning, cheese, or add-ins to make the dish your own.
