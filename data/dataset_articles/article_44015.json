  "text": "NEW YORK — Vincent Shavers wore a grin and a black practice jersey he’d been eyeing all season. The Miami kid never would have guessed the next step in his college football career would play out in the snowy Big Apple.\nNot that the Nebraska freshman linebacker hasn’t done plenty already in his Husker debut. He is the only 2024 signee to appear in every regular-season game as a steady contributor on defense while making plays on special teams too.\nHis role in Saturday’s Pinstripe Bowl will be more. Through merit. And because multiple other NU linebackers transferred elsewhere. He’ll rotate with seniors John Bullock and Javin Wright against a run-heavy Boston College attack.\n“I kept working, kept working, staying patient waiting for my time to come,” Shavers said Thursday after a brisk and sunny practice at Fordham’s home stadium in the Bronx. “Just kept putting in the work and finally got my Blackshirt. I’m proud, I’m happy, I’m ready to work.”\nPeople are also reading… Name of fire victim released, investigation remains ongoing Fremont's Juan Gonzalez commits to University of Oregon What’s open and closed on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day 2024?

It’s also about the next wave of Huskers setting a tone inside Yankee Stadium for what’s to come in 2025. Nebraska’s depth chart is littered with names of those getting an opportunity amid transfers and opt-outs. Many of those snaps will become harder to earn when a fresh crop of portal additions and high-school signees arrive in January.\nChances abound at defensive line where — beyond outgoing seniors Ty Robinson and Nash Hutmacher — new contributors must emerge on a more full-time basis next season. Riley Van Poppel is a lead candidate to do so now free from redshirt restrictions. His first trip to New York City has been fun, he said, but now it’s time to win a game. That’s the top priority.\n“Go out there and get a win to not only finish this year right… but then that leads you into next year,” the 6-foot-5, 290-pound Van Poppel said. “That really sets the tone for when we get back in January for winter workouts how those go, spring ball and then next season. This game is going to show a lot about who our team is next year.”\nThe extra bowl work — something Nebraska hasn’t had in eight winters — means more runway for what’s coming. Like culture, with coach Matt Rhule emphasizing that trips like this are a chance to act like professionals and leave places better than players found them. Like development, with former quarterback Heinrich Haarberg leaning more into a shift to tight end as one example of bowl-season tinkering.\nLike relationships too. Shavers is around snow for just the second time in his life, he said. But this is the first time he’s spent this much quality time with teammates at any level, touring the 9/11 memorial and snowball fight in Central Park included. It’s leaving him thankful and motivated.\n“Everybody’s happy,” Shavers said. “It’s like a brotherhood. We family. I’m happy for them. It’s all for the seniors.”\nShavers, perhaps not jokingly, said he’s embracing a bigger role Saturday even if it means playing long snapper or safety or something else. A glance at the defensive depth chart suggests he won’t be alone with the likes of underclassmen like linemen Keona Davis and Van Poppel, linebacker Dylan Rogers, rover Rahmir Stewart, safety Caleb Benning and others to potentially see their first extended looks.\nShavers is the latest success story from Nebraska’s Miami freshmen after Jacory Barney, who broke out quickly as the team’s leading pass-catcher. Linebacker Willis McGahee IV is also seeing a role increase while defensive backs Amare Sanders and Larry Tarver continue to impress behind the scenes.\nNew receivers coach Daikiel Shorts called the value of bowl practices “phenomenal.” They’ve helped him integrate quicker into the program in the few weeks since he left Kentucky. They’ve provided more practice repetitions to rising playmakers like Jaylen Lloyd and Carter Nelson.\nOne game left to show the gains. Then take that momentum in a carry-on back to Nebraska and into an offseason blessedly shorter than the Huskers are used to navigating.\n“All the younger guys, we know what to do,” Shavers said. “We know the standard. Let’s get it done. We don’t got time to be playing no more. It’s going to be our show.”",
