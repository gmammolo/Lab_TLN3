  "text": "Sonic 3 was released on December 25, 2024 in Mexico; and the spin-off film of the live-action film of the Lion King: Mufasa, which came out on December 19; They are being competitors at the box office at the end of the year, to which everything indicates that the third installment of the blue hedgehog and his friends will destroy the competition. Just as it did with its previous deliveries in 2020 and 2022 that also subjected the competition.\nTo understand the magnitude of this victory, Sonic 3 raised 60 million dollars, while Mufasa only reached 35 in an entire weekend domestically; However, it is expected that from Christmas to December 29 the blue hedgehog will manage to get another 50 million more and the Lion King spin-off will only get 45, so if we do the math there is a clear winner.\nFuente: Paramount Pictures\nEven before the commercial success of Sonic 3, the fourth installment of the blue hedgehog had been confirmed in development, since it is already a fact that Paramount Pictures found its goose that laid the golden eggs, managing to dominate the box office even during the holidays. . We still do not have more information about this film four, only that it is a reality and that we will probably see it released until 2027 if everything goes according to the schedule.\nWe also recommend: Sonic: his best video games to play after his third movie\nSonic 3: Who is Shadow? Shadow is a character straight out of video games, more specifically from Sonic Adventure 2 where the black hedgehog made his debut, from which it is known that the film will take inspiration and leave some clues from the game.\nFuente: Paramount Pictures\nThe origin of Shadow in video games is thanks to Mr. Gerard Robotnik, his creator and grandfather of the Dr. of the same surname, who we know will appear in the new Sonic the Hedgehog movie and will also be played by Jim Carrey.\nTell us, have you already gone to see Sonic 3?
