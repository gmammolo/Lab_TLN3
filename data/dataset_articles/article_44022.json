  "text": "Last weekend, Jump Festa 2025 was held, an event where some of the great news for the anime industry was announced. If you are a fan of Shonen Jump works, then we share with you all the most important details of this event.\nJujutsu Kaisen Fans of Gege Akutami’s work have much to celebrate. Although at the moment there is no release date, a new art of the third season of the Jujutsu Kaisen anime was shared. Likewise, it was confirmed that Hidden Inventory/Premature Death, a film that recapitulates the first five episodes of the second season of the anime, will hit theaters in Japan on May 30, 2025. Finally, it was confirmed that the Jujutsu manga Kaisen will have a 16-page epilogue that will be available alongside the last volume.\nDemon Slayer Despite everything that is on the way for Demon Slayer, at Jump Festa 2025 we saw Natsuki Hanae, Hiro Shimono and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka who confirmed that the Swordsmith Village arc will have a theatrical adaptation, although at the moment there are no more details about this production .\nSakamoto Days Sakamoto Days, one of the most anticipated anime for 2025, revealed a new trailer, with the closing theme Fuutsu by Conton Candy. Likewise, the additional cast was confirmed to include Hiroki Yasumoto as Hyo, Hochu Otsuka as Takamura, and Daisuke Namikawa as X/Slur.\nSpy x Family During Jump Festa 2025 we had the opportunity to see Special Mission 5, a special retrospective of the last years of the manga. Along with this, it was confirmed that the third season of the anime will be available sometime next October 2025, so it will be some time before we have the opportunity to have more information about the expected return of the Forger family. .\nTaste After a fantastic first impression with the first season, Science Saru confirmed that the second season will arrive in July 2025, and the cast reunited to review highlights from the first season. Along with this, a trailer was shared of what awaits us in Dandadan.\nMy Hero Academia After hundreds of rumors, during Jump Festa 2025 it was finally confirmed that the spin-off manga of My Hero Academia: Vigilantes will have an anime adaptation, although at the moment there is no release date for this series. Likewise, the eighth, and final, season of My Hero Academia will be available in the fall of 2025 for season 8.\nChainsaw Man After years without new information, MAPPA confirmed that Chainsaw Man: The Reze Arc will hit theaters sometime in 2025. The film will continue the events of the anime, and while there is a change of direction, fans are happy that this beloved arc finally has an adaptation.\nOne Piece As expected, the new voice actor for Franky in Japanese was revealed at the Super Stage. Kazuki Yao passed the baton to his colleague, Subaru Kimura. Likewise, a special illustration was shared confirming that the One Piece anime will return in April 2025, after a long wait.\nThese were the most important announcements of Jump Festa 2025, but not the only ones, since multiple productions confirmed new seasons, revealed more illustrations, and some of the plans for Shonen Jump adaptations for next year were announced. On related topics, this is the date for the third season of One Punch Man. Likewise, Dragon Ball Daima will hit theaters in Mexico with dubbing.\nAuthor’s Note:\nOf all the announcements, my favorite was the one for Chainsaw Man. After a couple of years of silence, it’s good to see that MAPPA is doing everything it can to make the adaptation of Tatsuki Fujimoto’s work a success, even when it seems that it is not.\nVia: Anime Corner",
