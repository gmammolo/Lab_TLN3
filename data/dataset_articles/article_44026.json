  "text": "Liverpool came from behind to take advantage of results elsewhere and move seven points clear at the top of the Premier League table thanks to a 3-1 win over Leicester.\nLiverpool 3-1 Leicester Premier League (17) | Anfield\nDecember 26, 2024\nGoals Ayew 6′\nGakpo 45+1′ (assist: Mac Allister)\nJones 49′ (assist: Mac Allister)\nSalah 82′ (assist: Gakpo)\nHeavy fog cast doubt over the fixture in the lead-up to kick-off and the mist that settled over Anfield made for tricky viewing – whether you were at the ground or watching from afar.\nArne Slot was armed with a strong squad missing just Ibrahima Konate and Conor Bradley through injury, and almost saw his side take an early advantage through Curtis Jones and Mo Salah.\nHowever, for the third time in the last five Premier League games, Liverpool allowed the visitors to strike first as Jordan Ayew outmanoeuvred Andy Robertson on the turn to make it 1-0.\nA deflection off Virgil van Dijk took it away from Alisson, but the goal was representative of the Reds’ sloppy start – perhaps we were fortunate we couldn’t see it clearly through the fog!\nUrged on by an expectant Anfield crowd, Robertson clipped the upright as balls were then readily sent into the Foxes’ box without success – which played into the hands of a deep-lying Leicester.\nAfter more than 30 crosses without a breakthrough, Gakpo showed the route to goal with a sumptuous finish into the side-netting after cutting inside onto his right boot.\nIt came moments after Salah clipped the crossbar and on the cusp of halftime – the relief was palpable amid the frustration at the officials’ inability to manage the clock.\nHalf time: Liverpool 1-1 Leicester\nGakpo, Jones and Salah with the goals in comeback win Federico Chiesa returned to squad Dominik Szoboszlai suspended for West Ham trip Reds move seven points clear at the top",
