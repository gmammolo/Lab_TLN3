  "text": "Marshawn Lynch Visited a Skittles Factory and Immediately Went Full Willy Wonka\nMarshawn Lynch loves his Skittles.\nThroughout his NFL career and well into his time as a broadcaster, Lynch has [never shied away from his love of the chewy candy](https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2015/06/30/marshawn-lynch-skittles-conan-obrien-video).\nAhead of Prime Videoâ€™s broadcast of Thursday Night Football this week, Lynch is taking that love to a new level. In a video posted in the lead-up to the nightâ€™s game between the Chicago Bears and Seattle Seahawks, Lynch can be seen visiting the Skittles factory in Yorkville, Illinois.\nHeâ€™s like a kid in a candy store. Or rather, a grown man in a candy factory. Either way, heâ€™s clearly excited.\nLynch went as far as to sign a box of Skittles that was being prepped for delivery.\nâ€œThatâ€™s the Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,â€� Lynch said. â€œThe golden ticket. Make sure that one gets out.\nâ€œWhen you find that package that I just signed, send that [expletive] to me. Iâ€™ve got a couple dollars for you.â€�\nSomewhere out in the world, there is a box of Skittles with Lynchâ€™s signature. Time to go Veruca Salt mode and find that golden ticket.",
