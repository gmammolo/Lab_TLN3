Menzel sang the opening of the number, but it was when Fallon hit play on the Casio keyboard that the soaring ballad was kicked up a notch to the showtstopper the world knows by heart.\nThe Tonight Show Host provided some backing vocals, but left the difficult high notes for Menzel, who belted them effortlessly — while sitting down, no less.\nElsa is just one of the iconic roles Menzel has played throughout her career. She originated the role of Elphaba in [Wicked](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/franchise/wicked) on Broadway, and even [made a special cameo](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/wicked-movie-cameos-from-the-musical) in the 2024 film adaptation alongside with her original Wicked co-star Kristin Chenoweth.\n\"Let It Go\" has been a phenomenon since its 2013 release — so much so that the song has been certified Diamond, meaning it \"has moved at least 10 million equivalent units by combining sales and streaming numbers.\"\n[RELATED: The Wicked Broadway Cameos You May Have Missed in the Wicked Movie](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/wicked-movie-cameos-from-the-musical)\n\"I'll never get sick of it, honestly. People always think you get sick of singing a song over and over,\" Menzel said on the [American Idol red carpet](https://youtu.be/yzrpbZ8OYsg?si=A4fMP1YCFUgAyyiq) in May 2024 after [accepting the Diamond certificate](https://youtu.be/e7zvi34fo2I?si=IK3pR0p5nQ7WpmJp) for the song's milestone achievement. \"But the truth is, if you really listen and embrace it, songs take on new meanings depending on what's happened in my life, who's sitting out there in the audience, maybe a young kid in a blue dress.\"\n\"You always have different people to sing it for or different realizations about yourself and what it means to you,\" she continued. \"I have heard a million stories, and each one is very profound and moving to me.\"\nWatch Menzel's amazing Classroom Instruments performance in The Tonight Show video above.",
