The lyrics ring too true for anyone who’s ever left an accessory behind, and Fallon dropped a cute fan-sourced video on TikTok for Christmas that features lonely gloves around the world.\nFallon and Ferrell overlapped as [Saturday Night Live](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/show/saturday-night-live) cast mates from 1998-2002, co-starring in iconic sketches like \"[More Cowbell](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/best-will-ferrell-sketches-snl),\" and they've [joined forces](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/lip-sync-battle-will-ferrell-kevin-hart-jimmy-fallon-watch) for [many collaborations](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/will-ferrell-chad-smith-drum-off-twins-video-jimmy-fallon) [on ](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/will-ferrell-nick-jonas-jimmy-fallon-jorts-video-song-mullets)[The Tonight Show](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/will-ferrell-nick-jonas-jimmy-fallon-jorts-video-song-mullets) in the years since. (Please note: “One Glove” has zero cowbell.)\n[RELATED: Chloe Fineman's Impression of Elmo Singing \"Jingle Bells\" Is Brilliant](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/chloe-fineman-elmo-jingle-bells-impression)\nJimmy Fallon and Will Ferrell's \"One Glove\" lyrics are so relatable\n\"One glove lying in the snow / Where’s the other one? Will we ever know?\" Fallon sings on the track. Appropriately, he was moved to produce a TiKTok slideshow from pictures of single gloves that fans sent in, which you can [(you can watch here](https://www.tiktok.com/@jimmyfallon/photo/7451184225048366366?lang=en)). Has anyone kept a set of gloves together for longer than a few years?\nIn the song, Ferrell and Fallon paint a picture of a lonely, half-chilled pedestrian, singing, \"Someone’s all alone, shivering in the cold / On her left-hand side, but her right hand's warm / Well, her hands are two different temperatures, In the middle of the storm.\"\nFortunately, the song has a happy ending, as the glove-finder returns the glove to the glove-needer, and — hand in gloved hand — they walk on.\n[RELATED: Matthew McConaughey Singing \"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\" Is Pure Holiday Joy](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/matthew-mcconaughey-singing-christmas-baby-please-come-home-jimmy-fallon-haim)\nWill Ferrell's on Jimmy Fallon's Christmas album\n\"One Glove\" is from Fallon's celeb-filled album of humorous holiday songs, [Holiday Seasonings](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/jimmy-fallon-holiday-seasoning-album-release-date-songs-artists), and it's available now.\nIn fact, Holiday Seasoning [debuted at No. 2](https://www.billboard.com/pro/jimmy-fallon-holiday-seasoning-debuts-billboard-charts/) on Billboard’s Top Holiday Albums chart and at No. 1 on the Comedy Albums chart.\n\"I am truly humbled by the success of Holiday Seasoning. When I asked Chat GPT to make a 'fun holiday album' I had no idea that it would be this big,\" Fallon joked [on X](https://x.com/jimmyfallon/status/1856147296389329121), following the news. \"Thank you everyone for supporting my album. (What a great list to be on?!?!?).\"\nThe collection includes singles “[It Was A… (Masked Christmas)](https://youtu.be/bSHz5S3yIzg?si=D1Nt9bogj_vASsNA)” featuring [Ariana Grande](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/people/ariana-grande) & Megan Thee Stallion, “[Almost Too Early For Christmas](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/dolly-parton-and-jimmy-fallon-christmas-song-2022-listen)” with [Dolly Parton](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/people/dolly-parton), and “[Wrap Me Up](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/jimmy-fallon-meghan-trainor-christmas-song-wrap-me-up-details)” featuring Meghan Trainor.\n[RELATED: Chloe Fineman's Transformative Impression of Elmo Singing \"Jingle Bells\" Is Brilliant](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/chloe-fineman-elmo-jingle-bells-impression)\nDuring Justin Timberlake's Tonight Show appearance on September 16, he and Fallon [teased their duet](https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/justin-timberlake-tour-update-jimmy-fallon-interview) for the new album. \"It's a silly song. It's called 'You'll Be There' and it's about a bromance,\" said Fallon. \"I mean, it's us,\" added Timberlake as Fallon played a snippet of the song, which starts with a ukulele. \"Nothing says Christmas like a ukulele,\" joked JT.\nGuess comedy and Christmas music go together like...well, like a pair of gloves.",
