  "text": "By Monojit Mandal\nThe Indian Super League (ISL), touted as India’s premier football competition, has steadily become a breeding ground for exceptional talent from across the country.\nAmong the brightest stars emerging from Meghalaya, Ricky Shabong and Samuel Kynshi, playing for Punjab FC, have carved their own niche.\nBoth players believe that with consistent improvements, such as the introduction of technologies like VAR and enhanced grassroots initiatives, the ISL can position itself as one of the premier leagues in Asia, driving the overall growth of the sport in the country.\nIn an exclusive interview with The Shillong Times, the duo shared insights into their journey, aspirations, and the state of Meghalaya football.\nA Sense of Pride and Responsibility\nFor both Shabong and Kynshi, representing Meghalaya on India’s biggest football stage is more than just personal achievement; it is a responsibility. “It’s a huge honour,” said Shabong, a central midfielder known for his composure on the ball. “It inspires others back home to chase their dreams and proves that talent from Meghalaya can make a mark on the national level.”\nKynshi, a defensive midfielder hailing from the village of Nongbah Bynther, echoed similar sentiments. “Playing in the ISL and making my national team debut at the Asian Games have been proud moments for me. They highlight the strides Meghalaya football has made, with grassroots development and coach education at the forefront.”\nThe ISL Experience: A Platform for Growth\nBoth players agreed that the ISL’s competitive environment pushes them to constantly evolve.\n“The level is high, and as a professional, you have to work hard, focus, and improve every day,” said Kynshi.\n“Being surrounded by experienced players in the squad helps you learn and grow, both on and off the pitch.”\nShabong highlighted the importance of specific skill sets for his role as a central midfielder.\n“Improving ball control, passing accuracy, and dribbling has been foundational for me. A central midfielder needs to drive the team forward, and these skills are crucial to fulfilling that role.”Aspirations Beyond BordersWhile excelling in the ISL remains their immediate focus, both players harbour dreams of playing abroad. “Experiencing new playing styles and higher levels of competition is every player’s dream,” said Shabong. “For me, playing abroad would be a great opportunity to grow further.”\nKynshi, however, remains grounded in his approach. “With experience and maturity, you understand the game better. For now, my focus is on improving with each passing day and contributing to my team’s success.”\nPunjab FC: A Family Beyond Football\nBoth Shabong and Kynshi had high praise for Punjab FC, a club they describe as pivotal in their development. “Punjab FC feels like a family,” said Shabong.\n“The club provides young players with the confidence and opportunities they need to showcase their talent. It’s been the best place for me to grow as a player.\n”Kynshi emphasized the team’s culture of togetherness. “Football is a team game, and at Punjab FC, we have experienced and talented players who help each other grow. The effective communication and teamwork translate well on the pitch, which is key to our success.”\nMeghalaya Football: A Bright Future\nBoth players are optimistic about the future of football in Meghalaya. “A lot of work is being done at the grassroots level,” said Kynshi. “Competitions for young players and the rise of academies are providing talent with the right platform. This progress is already visible in Meghalaya’s performance at national-level competitions.”\nShabong believes the ISL has a role to play in uplifting Indian football as a whole.\n“The ISL has improved year by year, but introducing technologies like VAR could further elevate the league and make it one of the best in Asia.”\nRicky Shabong and Samuel Kynshi embody the aspirations of a football-loving state like Meghalaya.\nTheir journey from local fields to the ISL serves as an inspiration to countless young footballers in the region.",
