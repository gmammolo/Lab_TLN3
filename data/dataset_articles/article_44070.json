  "text": "By : Lillie-Beth Brinkman//The Journal Record//December 26, 2024//\nBy : Lillie-Beth Brinkman//The Journal Record//December 26, 2024//\nWe’ve wrapped up a midweek Christmas Day and are looking ahead!\nI hope everyone had a merry one. I’m writing this column in one of my favorite holiday spots – the Great Hall of the beautiful and Oklahoma-historic First National Center in Oklahoma City. It’s a beautiful building on a regular day and even more spectacular decked out for the holidays – if you get a chance, stop by for some photos and marvel that this marble-covered lobby is in Oklahoma City.\nSince the two-story Christmas tree in the First National will put anyone in a festive mood, let’s talk about events coming up and those still here for the holidays that I know about so far.\n– First, Oklahoma Ranch is presenting the Oklahoma Opry’s “New Year’s Eve Eve” concert and fundraiser on Monday in Oklahoma City’s Bricktown at 425 Kings of Leon Lane with a variety of performers.\nThe VIP cocktail reception is at 6 p.m. for ages 21 and older, followed by the 7:30 p.m. show for all ages.\nPerformers include America’s Got Talent winner Darci Lynne and Friends, as well as Zach Ray, OK3, Owen Pickard, Kyle Earhart, Amanda Earhart, Tanner Massey, Maddox Ross, Cutter Elliott, Tammy Brasier, Jarrid Matlock, Cindy Scarberry, Haylie Bagwell and Dustin Jones.\nProceeds benefit the Opry Heritage Foundation of Oklahoma and its nonprofit programs, which include the Oklahoma Opry, Guitars for Vets: Oklahoma City Chapter, and the Granville Community Music School, show information states.\nThe evening includes a silent auction. For tickets, go to ohfo.org.\n– I can’t wait to hear the Oklahoma City band Soft Hands play their New Year’s (Eve Eve Eve Eve) show – NYEEEE – at the Tower Theatre in the Plaza District on Saturday, Dec. 28. They’re performing selections for their Yacht Rock Spectacular and Neon Mix Tape shows at 8 p.m. Every time I have heard this band perform live, I have had the best time watching this ensemble local group. For information or tickets go to com.\n– The Myriad Botanical Gardens continues its “Myriad and Bright” holiday celebration through Sunday with a light and music show in the Inasmuch Foundation Crystal Bridge Conservatory each night through 8 p.m. In addition, the Devon Ice Rink is open through Feb. 2 on the Myriad grounds in downtown Oklahoma City. For information about both, go to org.\n– While you’re downtown, check out Scissortail Park’s Holiday Lights Around the Park through New Year’s Day along the Upper Park and at Union Station. For details go to https://scissortailpark.org/ or stop by for a walk.\n– You have one week to see the Oklahoma City Zoo’s Safari Lights presented by OG&E through Jan. 1. Drive through the wintery wonderland scenes of wildlife and holiday decorations or walk through or do both nightly through 11 p.m. The drive-thru and walk are separate experiences. Drive-thru admission for per car ($75 on Friday and Saturday and $70 on the other days) includes four tickets to the walk-thru. Walk-thru tickets are $18 and $16. For tickets or information, go to https://www.okczoo.org/.\nHave an idea, item or event for On the Town? Email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).",
