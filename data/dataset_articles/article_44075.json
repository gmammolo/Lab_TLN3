  "text": "Independent TTRPG designer Graham Gentz has released a new project. The game, Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti, is an experience about groups of criminals, doomed heists, and character development through adversity. Furthermore, the game's sales will go towards assisting trans youth.\nBreaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti on Itch\nAs described on its [Itch page](https://grahamgentz.itch.io/breaking-the-vault-of-viditya-voleti), Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti is a nonlinear collaborative game where your group becomes a team of criminals on a heist that goes wrong.\nThe group decides on the setting of the heist and their final goal. That goal can be assassination, rescuing a prisoner, or sabotaging a doomsday weapon. The setting can be in Ancient China, World War 2, or even in a dieselpunk fantasy setting. Either way, the group is given an ultimatum and most fulfill their mission.\nAs the game progresses, character and context is revealed, culminating in a death scene where the group succeeds thanks to one character's sacrifice. The players themselves must decide if this act of selflessness was out of genuine character growth or not. To quote the game's description, \"You are not a good person, but will you die that way?\"\nBreaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti may be a reference or homage to another indie designer in the space. The titular Viditya Voleti has a distinct body of work, producing system-agnostic fantasy work as well as the competitive card game The Anatomy of Fear.\nThe author, Graham Gentz, has similarly eclectic work, including Immortal Lich Henry Kissinger, Aggressively Strange: Sailing The Spooky Wildsea, and [Under The Autumn Strangely](https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/under-autumn-strangely-pastoral-horror-and-shared-stories).\nLastly, 100% of all sales of Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti will go to the [Trans Youth Emergency Project](https://southernequality.org/tyep/). This nonprofit organization provides logistical and financial support for transgender youth throughout the American South. This includes travel expenses, medication, as well as mental health and wellness needs.\nThe game is available now in PDF format for as little as $6.",
