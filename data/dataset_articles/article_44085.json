  "text": "The overall takeaway to proposed plans to provide a walking trail down Brewery Hill was one of enthusiasm and positivity if last week’s meeting is anything to go by.\nApproximately 100 residents turned out to hear Brandon Duffey, PE, GreatWest Engineering talk about the recently conducted feasibility study.\nThe study was carried out at the request of the Red Lodge CCE, Alpine Basin HOA, and the Red Lodge Urban Renewal Agency. If supported City could pursue MDOT TA grant application that would be due April 9.\nIf awarded the design process would being in 2026 with construction 2027.\nThe estimated cost would be just over $1 million with a local match requirement of 13.42 percent amounting to $140,357 that would include 20 percent contingency and 4 percent inflation to 2027 costs.\nThe favored plan is to add to the existing north side trail at Lazy M taking it down passed the entrance to Alpine Basin where a crosswalk to the south side of the Highway will be installed allowing residents to walk down the south side of Brewery Hill.\nThe cross walk at Alpine Basin is considered a safer option because of better visuals for traffic and people.\nDuffey said that the study took into account obvious obstacles such as the narrow corridor, utilities, the pond on the south side, and the wetlands on the north side wetland, along with driveway approaches, and ADA crossings.\nAt the meeting Duffey took into consideration a request for extending the lighting along Highway 78 to make it safer for people walking.\nConcerns were raised regarding the placement of the proposed crosswalk just at the top of Brewery Hill especially as the hill ices up in winter but were addressed by suggestions to reduce the speed limit to 25 mph. Duffey said he would talk to MDOT about this at the next meeting.\nMayor Dave Westwood added that he was concerned about coming out of Alpine.\n“It is less scary than pulling a left from Lazy M, and if there is a cross walk there, it does push MDOT to lowering the speed limit further up that hill.”\nA suggestion was made to extend the path from the Rodeo Grounds, as there was already a cross walk there and keeping the path on one side.\nDuffey thought it was a valid point but questioned if people were going to walk down the north side to the present cross walk only to cross and then start back the way they came but on the south side.\nDuffey acknowledged there was a safety concern with Word Ave. coming on to Brewery Hill and proposed walkways and it needs evaluation.\nHe added it is a “challenging intersection.”\nFor the majority of the meeting there was an air of excitement that Red Lodge could have a new source of connectivity to the Red Lodge by 2027.\nThe City as well as Beartooth Trails are taking in correspondence for the Brewery Hill Trail.\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters (0 Ratings)",
