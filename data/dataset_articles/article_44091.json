  "text": "In the name, image, and likeness (NIL) era, recruiting is shaped by the dollar figure. Duke showcased a record-breaking example earlier this month.\nThe Blue Devils, more often associated as a basketball powerhouse, received a commitment from Tulane transfer quarterback Darian Mensah on Dec. 11. On Monday, CBS Sports reported Mensah’s NIL deal with Duke to be worth $8 million over two years, with a $4 million average annual salary that would make him the unofficial highest paid player in the history of college football .\nThe offer showcases the steep year-over-year rise of the NIL market as Mensah, ranked by 247Sports as the No. 7 quarterback in the transfer portal , received deals worth more than twice as much as Cam Ward and Riley Leonard, two of last season’s top transfer quarterbacks. Former Washington State QB John Mateer, the No. 1 ranked transfer quarterback according to 247Sports, committed to Oklahoma on Dec. 18 and will reportedly receive a deal similar to Mensah.\nMensah’s commitment to Duke came just a day after AJ Dybansta, the No. 1 men’s basketball high school recruit in the Class of 2026, chose BYU over Alabama and bluebloods UNC and Kansas. The Cougars reportedly offered Dybantsa close to $7 million for one year of service .\nThe rising deals are likely not going to stop as schools, especially if the House v. NCAA settlement receives its final approval in April. Division I schools will be allowed to share revenue with players, and starting next year, some can pay up to around $22 million to all athletes .\nBut with revenue-sharing expected to come, some schools are already starting to spend big in anticipation of the spike. Others that already have massive budgets from their collectives are trying to use up what they’ve already raised before the new rules take effect.",
