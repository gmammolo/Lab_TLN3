  "text": "As a student manager for the UA men’s basketball team, Canyon Torres’ love for his favorite sport has evolved over the years. Growing up in Tucson, Torres played the game throughout his youth and in high school.\nHe said he realized at some point that he wouldn’t continue playing basketball competitively after high school, but still was passionate about the game and didn’t want to leave it behind. So, during his freshman year, Torres joined the UA men’s team as an equipment manager.\nNow, as a sophomore, Torres has bigger goals. After connecting with the players and coaches, learning and gaining knowledge, he hopes to join the men’s coaching staff after he graduates.\nBeing a student manager has many benefits, he said, but it also has its challenges.\n“Nobody knows what goes into the program,\" he said. “And it feels like a 9-to-5 with a lot of work.”\nPeople are also reading…\nStudent managers are expected to be available to staff and coaches, help scout for the team, help the program with team film and support the coaches.\nAs a student manager, preparing for game days means making sure players are ready and there on time, and that their equipment is well organized. It also means helping players arrive on time for film sessions and warm-ups before the game starts.\nTorres said on game days, the McKale Center’s fan base creates a lot of great energy, and even on-the-road energy is contagious. Torres loves the environment as he is walking out with the players onto the court — especially when they are about to play against a good opponent. After a win? Torres describes it as a great feeling and said celebrating in the locker room with the team is electric.\nOne of the challenges of working with the team, however, is missing out on college life because you are so busy with basketball.\n“You get FOMO, and if you don’t love being around the game, you’re wasting your time,” he said. “You don’t have much free time, you never know what days you have off while making time for yourself to be available for the team.”\nTorres said his time with the team has changed him, both personally and professionally. He used to be silent around players and coaches. His time on the team has helped him communicate better, he said. Now, he speaks up about what he believes in. He’s also learned directly from Arizona’s men’s basketball head coach Tommy Lloyd, as well as Brian Briggs, the program’s equipment manager.\nWith more than 20 years of experience in basketball management, Briggs has spread his skills and knowledge among his student managers and the program. Working together for a common goal and making sure players are taken care of is his philosophy for success.\nBriggs said Torres is a hard worker who is always on the move, and he appreciates what Torres has brought to the program and team.\nFew students work with the UA basketball team, and Torres has taken full advantage of the opportunity, making a name for himself with Briggs and the staff. As Torres enters his second year as equipment manger, Briggs said he will continue pushing him to be better at his work and craft.\nArizona Sonoran News is a news service of the University of Arizona School of Journalism.",
