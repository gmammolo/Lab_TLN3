  "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nEmmy Russell is pregnant with Baby No. 1!\nRussell, 25, revealed in a recent episode of the Got It From My Momma podcast that she’s expecting a baby with her partner, fellow singer-songwriter Tyler Ward , 40. The American Idol finalist and her mother, Patsy Russell , appeared together on an episode of the podcast earlier this month. It was previously recorded live on Music Row in Nashville, Tennessee.\nHost Jennifer Vickery Smith launched the podcast to feature conversations with mothers of entertainers, including about their childhoods and family lives. Vickery Smith said at the top of the episode that “Emmy Rose has some special news to share tonight.”\n“Y’all, me and Tyler are expecting a baby girl,” Emmy announced. Ward briefly joined her on stage and cradled his hands over Emmy's growing baby bump “I’m so excited. Right out of American Idol , I didn’t know. So, you know, that’s kind of been the journey. So I’m so excited. I’m so looking forward to it. …This is the first time I’m actually fully announcing that. I thought it was fitting for this.”\nThroughout the conversation, Emmy and Patsy spoke about their lives with their grandmother and mother, respectively, Loretta Lynn . The beloved country trailblazer “passed away peacefully…in her sleep” the morning of October 4, 2022 at her ranch in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee. She was 90. Emmy previously shared how Lynn empowered her to write her own music . She also honored her late grandmother with emotional tributes during her run on American Idol earlier this year.\nFind Got It From My Momma on iHeartRadio here .",
