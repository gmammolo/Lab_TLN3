(Photo/Evan Walsh) SHREWSBURY – There’s no place like home for these Shrewsbury officers.\nEvery member of the Shrewsbury Police Department take their role of protecting the community seriously, but the job simply “means more” to a group of officers who grew up in the community, attended Shrewsbury High School, and continue to support the town today. The department estimates that approximately 50% of Shrewsbury officers police their hometown.\n“It just means more. The business that got broken into, you can remember shopping there as a kid. The medical call is your brother’s friend. The people you deal with — it’s not just another call, it means something. A lot of us live in town, and you’re making your own community better,” said Detective Jeff Svendsen, a 2014 graduate of Shrewsbury High School.\n“You know a lot of the people, the streets you’re going through. You know the town, the backstories. You know, or you know through association, the families you deal with,” said 2016 graduate Patrolman Tyler Vlass. “Seeing different communities and seeing what Shrewsbury has to offer — it’s a great community. Everything you need is here. Great school system. Great police department to come work for. It is something really special, and you want to be a part of that. I wanted to serve the community.”\nAnd while members of the Shrewsbury Police Department experience strong support from the community, they’ve made it their mission to return the favor, establishing a Community Engagement Team that seeks to create positive interactions and foster meaningful relationships with residents throughout town. It’s all part of the department’s “community policing” philosophy.\n“I can tell you first-hand how much it means to serve the community that shaped me,” said Chief Kevin Anderson, who grew up in Shrewsbury. “I think it is invaluable to have police officers serving the community that they grew up in … When we deal with youth in town we don’t just see young people, we see our younger selves. Being able to form these connections and to build this trust and relationships with the people we serve is our goal.”\n“Our mission, our goal, is to serve the community and strengthen those relationships that we have. That’s basically our mission statement … The public can see us as real people — not just a badge, a gun, and a bulletproof vest. The community engagement gets us out of the cars. I’ve seen a huge shift in policing since I’ve been a cop,” said Sergeant David Faucher, a 1996 Shrewsbury High School graduate.\nThe department’s community-focused approach has led to events like Community Night, which includes food trucks, bounce houses, live music, and more. The Shrewsbury Police Department has organized charitable events — the Stuff-a-Cruiser Food Drive and December’s Toy Drive, for instance — and has made a concerted effort to be wherever the community is gathering, including October’s Truck or Treat event.\nAnd sometimes the smallest interactions are the most meaningful, the officers said. The department’s monthly “Coffee with a Cop” event has drawn crowds at the Senior Center, and its outreach to Shrewsbury’s youth has also increased. Police have given presentations at Sherwood Middle School, and in September, the Shrewsbury Police Department distributed free ice cream vouchers to children who were wearing a helmet while riding bicycles or scooters throughout town.\n“One of the goals of the Community Engagement Team is trying to connect and interact with the younger generation. You see elementary-school kids or middle-schoolers — we want their first interaction with the police to be positive. We want them to see us at their basketball games, at their sporting events, plays, concerts. We want to interact with those kids early and often,” said Patrolman Dillon Zona.\nIt’s all about creating a stronger community. Because for many officers, it’s their community too.\n“The town of Shrewsbury did a lot for me when I was in town growing up. I wanted to give back to the town, and I figured, ‘What better way to do it than becoming a police officer?’ I try to be involved in the community as much as I can — I still coach baseball. Shrewsbury did a lot for me, so it’s time for me to give back,” Zona, a 2017 Shrewsbury High School graduate, added.",
