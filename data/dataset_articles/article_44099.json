  "text": "LEAVENWORTH, Wash. — Leavenworth's Front Street Park lawn reopened for sledding thanks to fresh snowfall, [days after it was vandalized](/article/news/local/downtown-leavenworth-park-sledding-hill-vandalized-days-before-christmas/281-145a9f06-5543-4e6e-a51e-aef70ce220b8) by a pickup truck doing donuts in the grass.\nOn Thursday, the city said the park was back open for sledding after a foot of snow fell overnight. Photos in the post announcing the reopening showed people already enjoying the snow-covered hill.\nThe Bavarian mountain town is a popular winter destination, especially over the holiday break.\nOn Saturday around 11:30 p.m., a truck was captured on video driving through the Front Street Park lawn, sending icy mud flying and crashing into nearby snow drifts.\nA 90 foot by 50 foot section of the park lawn was damaged by the vehicle, the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said. At the time, the city described the park as \"unusable, unsafe, and severely damaged.\"\nThe park was temporarily closed following the incident and city employees worked to restore the park throughout the week, as conditions allowed.\nThe Chelan County Sheriff’s Department confirmed the incident is under investigation.\nLaw enforcement told KING 5 the pickup that caused the damage appears to be a 2024 silver Toyota Tundra with the Texas license plate TTR1528. The driver appears to be a man in his 20s to 30s. He has not been identified.\nOnce the driver is identified, police expect probable cause will be found for reckless driving and second-degree malicious mischief.\nAnyone with information about the incident or the suspect driver should contact the Chelan County Sheriff's Office at (509) 667-6845.",
