  "text": "For those who appreciate a good cocktail, this holiday season offers patrons a mix of caffeine and alcohol – including energy drinks, as well as coffee-flavored liquor and beer.\nJaxon Blunt, a bartender at Kroner and Baer Pub, said besides holiday drinks like the Yippe-Ki-Yay Moscow Mule with cranberry juice, thyme and Tito's vodka, cocktails featuring coffee-flavored vodka are popular.\n\"We also have a coffee bock beer that's pretty popular, made by Rose Rock Coffee,\" Blunt said. \"The same guy who does the coffee has a brewery.\"\nA post on Kroner's Facebook page states the beer is \"triple local\" and brewed by Downing Brewery, using Rose Rock Coffee.\nTera Webb and her husband James Webb, said on Dec. 21 that they had just come from Emery's Grill, taking advantage of that restaurant's Saturday brunch specials, and then went to Kroner's for drinks.\n\"They do a great mimosa at Kroner, and James loves Red Bull and vodka,\" Tera said. \"We love coffee vodka; this weekend was James' birthday and we made a shot out of coffee vodka and chocolate Baileys [Irish Cream] – it made a killer shot.\"\nAt the Squeeze Inn, Brendan Barlow said hot chocolate and coffee, with alcohol added, is one of the preferred choices this year.\nEggnog with a shot of liquor is always a favorite of the season, and Barlow said he heard on an NPR report that when making homemade eggnog, the alcohol should be added to the egg mixture before the cream, which purportedly makes it safer because it kills any bacteria in the eggs.\n\"Red Bull is back and that's weird to me; when I was working [as a bartender] in 2010, Red Bull with vodka was so popular at that point it was called an RBV,\" Barlow said.\nFlavored alcohol is popular, like Jose Cuervo's Devil's Reserve pineapple and mango combinations, and \"are kind of fun.\" Flavored vodkas are sweeter alcohols and most like it combined with some kind of soda, or combining two flavors of the liquor – like vanilla and blueberry, Barlow said.\n\"The most popular vodka is Tito's; Oklahoma has a love-hate affair with Texas and it's a Texas product,\" Barlow said.\nHe pointed out that the bottle for Stoli's used to have more Russian script on it, and the brand featured the whole name – Stolichnaya Vodka – but now it just says \"Stoli Vodka,\" Barlow said.\n\"It just says imported from Latvia; [Russia] is obviously not a popular topic to bring up,\" Barlow said.\nIn March 2022, the company that produces this vodka rebranded it because the owner of the company has been a critic of President Vladimir Putin, states an NPR article.\n\"Exiled Russian-born billionaire Yuri Shefler, who owns the company that produces the vodka, has been a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin for decades,\" states an article on NPR titled, \"Stolichnaya Vodka rebrands as 'Stoli,' trying to distance itself from Putin,\" published March 22, 2022.\nIn recent years, the vodka has been produced in Latvia by the Luxembourg-based Stoli Group, states the article.\nHannah Trude, bartender and server at Linney Breaux's Cajun Eatery, serves a smoky old-fashioned, with a hand-cut, round, crystal-cut piece of ice.\nThe ingredients are Bulleit bourbon, bitters, a \"Luxardo Maraschino\" cherry, simple syrup and finished off with smoke using maple wood chips in a handheld smoker, Trude said.\n\"And always stirred, never shaken,\" Trude said. \"I'm pretty sure James Bond said something like that.\"\nCo-owner of Linney Breaux's, Mike Linney, said Trude makes one of the best old-fashioneds \"in America.\" She travels to different places to learn more about making cocktails, he said.\nLinney said the most popular drink at his restaurant is the smoky old-fashioned, and Trude said people are also ordering martini's and mules.\n\"There are different versions of mules – the Moscow Mule, Dark and Stormy, and our own mule that has spiced rum in it – Kickin' Cajun Mule – with cayenne,\" Trude said. \"And our spiked eggnog is popular – the eggnog is homemade.\"",
