  "text": "Hello fellow hivers on chain, hope the season is going well on your side. 26/12/2024 met me with lots of good new of which I'm going to share one of it with you. You know a blind Man can never lead a blind man. You can only lead when you can see and know how to walk and where to go.\nFew months ago, I signed up a friend on Hive but inconsistency affected me and him and he didn't really understand what [#Hive](/trending/hive) ecosystem is all about. This morning I chatted him up to revive his interest on Hive and you know what, He was very happy I did. He asked a lot of questions to really know what I e stand to benefit on hive if he brings in value on Hive. Some of his questions are, * what is HBD?\n- How can I stake HIVE?\n- What is HIVE POWER?\n- How to buy HBD and HIVE and how to withdraw it?\n- Is there any referral program and how does it work?\n- How does Hive keychain work?\n- What is ecency point?\nTo answer some of this questions, I send to him link of[leoGgrossary](/hive-167922/@leoglossary/leoglossary-hive-backed-dollar-hbd)that explained almost all the questions and give answers on it.I helped him to login to his hive account through Whatsapp video and screen sharing. He also set up his hive keychain account and ecency app. He also learn about\n[#AlIVE](/trending/alive)token and the We Are Alive Front End. It was almost full day work for us today. My joy was that he really love the system and want to onboard others on Hive.\nSome of his beautiful comments to show that Hive blockchain has what he has been looking for.\nOn going training on Hive keychain explaining different tokens and their community. I showed him how to claim[#ZING](/trending/zing)token of he buy Hive and power it up then delegate to[#holozing](/trending/holozing)community. I also showed him how to stake ALIVE and the benefit of staking.\nStill on hive keychain on how to buy Hive using fiat currency from different exchange and to make it more easier, I sent to him a link that explained that more[link](https://youtu.be/sVx8IJTWIo8?si=ywuyumYIGUPvUYgr)I made it clear to him that he needs hive power to write and perform so many activities on hive which he is getting ready to do now. Now I know that many of our newbies who are inactive is because they have not understood the chain and don't have proper guide.In summary, let's reach out to friends and relatives out there to tell them about hive blockchain. Unemployment is high out there and so many of them do not know what to do. Information they say is power, we need to inform them about hive and help them to take their stand on Hive.",
