Scott, Michael Caine or a duck, the central character of Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol is an iconic grouch. He’s the 19th century version of the guy yelling at the neighborhood kids to get off his lawn, the meanie who won’t give their ball back once it lands in his yard. But he’s also, next to the person on whom the entire season is based, someone who represents one of the most important tenets of our humanity— the understanding that we are responsible for our neighbors, and that in acting on that belief we grow and become better people . That beautiful notion is also the core value of The Foodbank Players , which makes our third annual production of the play something nearly sacred.\n[Richmond ·](/richmond-ca)16d\n[ · Followuser · 627 followers](/m/feelingvegas-1713562)\nFeelingVegas\n11 Free Activities in Las Vegas That’ll Make Christmas Unforgettable\nIs it possible to dive into the glitzy world of Las Vegas without emptying your wallet, especially at Christmas?
