  "text": "ATLANTIC – The Atlantic Police Department and Atlantic Reserves programs — including Family Dreams Christmas and Shop with a Cop- helped 99 children and 21 adults in Cass County in 2024, according to an email from Atlantic Police Chief Devin Hogue. Hogue also said the number of people helped in the Shop with a Cop program was 55, and that number is the highest number of children that participated in the program’s history.\nHogue said in the email that on Saturday, Dec. 21, Atlantic Police Reserves held their annual Family Dreams Christmas Program. During this program, families are paired up with Reserve Officers and taken around town shopping. This year’s program assisted eight families for the full shopping experience and six families that were invited to pick items from our mobile toys store. Each family also received a full Christmas dinner that they could take home and make. Organizers were assisted this year by the Atlantic Girls Basketball Team as well as a couple of past Reserves. In total, this program assisted 44 children and 21 adults from 14 families.\nHe also said on Sunday, Dec. 22, officers from the Atlantic Police Department held their annual “Shop with a Cop” event at the Atlantic Walmart Store. This program pairs a family with an officer and they go shopping for items they need and some that are on the wish list. Officers were assisted this year by the Atlantic Police Reserves, deputies from the Cass County Sheriff’s Office,troopers from the Iowa State Patrol, members of the Iowa DNR, and members of the SWI Chaplains Association, as well as retired officers and some officer’s children and spouses. In total, participants shopped for 55 children during this year’s program, making it the largest in their history by far.\nHogue said he appreciated all the people who supported the programs because they make it possible for the programs to happen.\n“In total, the Family Dreams Christmas and Shop with a Cop programs assisted 99 children and 21 adults from 32 Cass County Families in having a much more enjoyable holiday,” Hogue said. “ We would not be able to make these programs happen without the tremendous support of our community. Thank you to all of the businesses, groups, organizations, and individuals who donated and make these programs possible!”\nOriginally published on swiowanewssource.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .",
