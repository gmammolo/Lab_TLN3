  "text": "A group of good Samaritans “lifted” a New York City cab that had jumped a curb and hit several people in Manhattan on Christmas Day, rescuing a mother and child who were trapped under the car.\nAccident occurred when northbound taxi driver became confused outside Macy's I hit it Several people were standing on the sidewalk at the intersection of 34th Street and 6th Avenue just after 4 p.m., ABCNY reported.\nThe 58-year-old driver reportedly experienced medical symptoms that may have contributed to the accident.\nOne eyewitness, a tourist from Oregon, told the magazine how he made sure his wife, who had been hit in the back of the shoulder by a taxi, was okay before taking action.\n“I ran over and there was a little boy, his foot was under the passenger tire and it was spinning, and there was a group of people,” the man said. “One gentleman…got into it to cut it off. Our whole group ripped off the fender and lifted the car back up. And that's when I grabbed the little boy and threw him into the corner. I eventually realized that it was his mother underneath.”\nThe Good Samaritan noted that despite her injuries, the 9-year-old boy's mother appeared “incredibly” stable and responsive considering the circumstances.\nA total of six pedestrians were hit by the car, but only the mother and child (41) and another victim (49) were taken to the hospital after being pulled out from under the car. Police said none of the injuries were life-threatening.\nPolice added that the driver was also taken to the hospital.",
