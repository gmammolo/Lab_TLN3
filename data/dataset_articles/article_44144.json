  "text": "In the video that was captured by a Reddit user, a son can be seen hugging his mother during a Jelly Roll concert.\nThe connection between a [mother and a son](https://scoop.upworthy.com/mother-son-graduate-from-same-university-promise-made-20-years-ago) is often one of the purest on this planet. It is a relationship built on deep emotional understanding that begins from the moment of birth. A mother is often the very first caregiver and ends up having a strong influence on the young brain. Similarly, in a heartwarming video shared by [u/jshump](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/1hjm58z/mom_finds_reel_of_her_and_her_son_sharing_a/) on Reddit, a young son [can be seen embracing](https://scoop.upworthy.com/emma-watson-embraces-aging-with-a-positive-attitude) his mother during a Jelly Roll concert. \"The video already had me smiling, but then I opened up the comments and found Mom's comment,\" read the caption of the video.\nThe video was uploaded by somebody who had accidentally recorded the [sweet moment](https://scoop.upworthy.com/veteran-actor-gets-standing-ovation-at-sag-awards) between the mom and the son. The person later shared the video with the overlay text, \"I was looking through my favorites folder and forgot I caught this moment on video. Someone find them so I can send this video to them.\"\nTo the poster's [pleasant surprise](https://scoop.upworthy.com/landlord-faces-backlash-for-doubling-the-rent-ex2), the video did find the mother, who later took to the comment section and wrote: \"Thank you so much for capturing this moment of me and my son. You have no idea how much that moment meant to him and, of course, to see the joy in his eyes (and how much it meant to me as well). The first thing he said to me after bumping Jelly Roll was I love you, Mama. I am so thankful. I was scrolling and found this tonight. Thank you a million times over.\"\nPeople in the comment section were taken aback. \"The fact that his first instinct upon having something amazing happen to him that makes him really happy is to tell his mother he loves her is just really hitting me where it hurts right now, I don't know. It tells me the kid has a good heart,\" wrote [u/Therefore_I_Yam](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/1hjm58z/comment/m39lx2z/).\nAnother person talked about Jelly Roll and his kind heart. \"Nice! On another note, I've seen Jelly Roll like 12-15 times live back when he was doing rap. He'd come through after his set and talk to everyone. He's a genuinely great guy. I'm so happy he blew up because he deserves all the success in the world,\" added [u/Heyguysimcooltoo](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/1hjm58z/comment/m3bi6u2/).\nA son's love for his mother is unparalleled. It's deeply profound, a relationship that truly stands the test of time.\n[In another heartwarming story](https://scoop.upworthy.com/mother-son-graduate-from-same-university-promise-made-20-years-ago), a mother from Maryland and her son received their college diplomas together from the same university. Back in December 2022, Immanuel Patton, who was 23 at the time, and Carolyn, who was 63, accepted their university degrees from the University of Maryland Global Campus (UMGC) in Adelphi. According to [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/01/06/mom-graduate-college-maryland-patton/), Patton promised Carolyn when he was in kindergarten that they would graduate together. \"I'd brought it up several times over the years, especially when my sister got her bachelor's degree,\" he said. \"I told my mom, 'It's almost time. We can get this done together.'\" The single mother of two was always motivated to earn her bachelor's degree.",
