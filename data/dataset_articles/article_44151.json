  "text": "The man received different goodies in the package that the woman left for him and other delivery executives.\nThe delivery executives and mailmen play an essential role [in our daily lives](https://scoop.upworthy.com/25-hilarious-memes-that-accurately-describe-the-daily-lives-of-shy-introverts). Without thinking much about their daily challenges, be it long hours, heavy loads, or weather conditions, they try their best to make our lives easier and functional. This is one of the reasons why we must think about their wellbeing. After all, it is the little gestures that create the greatest impact. In one such heartfelt post uploaded by a woman, [u/miranda-the-dog-mom](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/1hgu7du/i_leave_a_basket_of_treats_on_my_porch_for/), on Reddit, a photo showcases [how much a bit of kindness can mean](https://scoop.upworthy.com/ups-driver-left-kind-message-doorbell-camera-kindess-rewarded-557052-557052-557052) to somebody.\nThe woman shared a note she received from her mailman after she left baskets of treats on her porch for delivery men on multiple occasions. \"Hello. Thank you for having goodies on your porch when I [deliver packages](https://scoop.upworthy.com/delivery-driver-pretends-to-be-a-preacher-after-noticing-womans-hide-packages-from-husband-doormat). They really make a difference, Your Mailman Todd,\" read the handwritten note. \"I leave a basket of treats on my porch for delivery folks. Today, my mailman left me a note about it,\" the woman added in the caption. In her comment, the woman also shared the contents of the package. \"Bottles of water, liquid death, various Gatorades, Lay's chip snack packs, and always a container full of candy. Right now, it's Ghirardelli Christmas chocolates,\" she added.\nPeople in the comment section were quick to talk about the [thoughtful initiative](https://scoop.upworthy.com/former-librarian-starts-a-brilliant-initiative-to-promote-literacy-in-low-income-neighborhoods-ex1) that is much needed in this economy. \"We have a mini-fridge full of sodas, water, and snacks for the delivery people. They appreciate it. Especially since my wife orders so much shit,\" wrote [u/Temporary_Tune5430](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/1hgu7du/comment/m2m4i41/). \"OP gets a dub for the goodies. Mailman gets a dub for the note. And I'm now getting to go to bed in an excellent mood with a little more faith in humanity. Frickin dubs all around. Thanks for sharing!\" added [u/Adventurous_Hope_101](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/1hgu7du/i_leave_a_basket_of_treats_on_my_porch_for/).\nAll it takes to [brighten up somebody's day](https://scoop.upworthy.com/25-hilarious-and-sarcastic-comic-strips-from-everyday-life-that-can-brighten-up-a-dull-day-643594-643594-643594-643594-643594) is thoughtfulness. [In another encounter](https://scoop.upworthy.com/mailman-family-invites-mailman-to-thanksgiving-dinner-after-his-heroic-act-saved-their-loved-ones-life), a mailman saved an elderly man from major injuries and earned him a new buddy. It was just another day for Guy Miller, who was out on a walk with his dog Bentley. While on the walk, he slipped and fell on the road, injuring himself. Miller, a resident of Aurora, Chicago, was thankfully seen by United States Postal Service worker Jaylen Lockhart, who, without any second thoughts, jumped to help him.\nHe rushed Miller to a nearby hospital. The worker later told reporters that he had spotted Miller, who took a tumble in his rearview mirror while driving his truck in the neighborhood. He[ immediately called 911](https://scoop.upworthy.com/a-little-boy-called-911-with-an-urgent-message-the-police-showed-up-to-the-cutest-surprise-ex1) and ensured that Miller's wife, Marcia, was informed about the incident. \"I wasn't sure exactly what I was getting myself into. But I did know that whatever he was going through on that ground, we were going to go through it together,\" Lockhart told [WLS-TV](https://abc7chicago.com/post/mail-carrier-jaylen-lockhart-given-honor-lighting-official-aurora-illinois-christmas-tree-saving-guy-miller-after-fall/15578145/). Later, to thank him, the Millers invited Lockhart to join their family feast on Thanksgiving. \"I said, 'What are you doing for Thanksgiving? Do you have a family?' We said, 'We're family, definitely,'\" Marcia shared with NBC Chicago, adding that it was great to see his kindness, compassion and care for the world.",
