  "text": "FOX News Channel host Sean Hannity and Ainsley Earhart are engaged. (Fox News)\nFOX News Channel hosts Sean Hannity and Ainsley Earhart have officially taken their relationship to the next level.\nHannity proposed to Earhart at their hometown church on Christmas, cementing their long-term bond. The newly engaged couple received blessings and support from their children and said they “couldn't be happier.”\n“We are so happy and so grateful to our families for their love and support during this wonderful time in our lives,” Earhart and Hannity said in a statement.\nEarhardt and Hannity have always been bonded by their deep faith and have put God first in their relationship, so proposing at their home church was the “perfect place” to ask that question, the couple said. After their engagement, they met with the minister.\nFOX News dominates viewership in 2024, joins CNN and MSNBC to lead in unprecedented news year\nAlthough the couple prefers to keep their personal lives out of the spotlight, they make their long-distance relationship work by taking weekend trips between New York, where Earhart is based, and Florida, where Hannity lives. Out of respect for each other's careers, Hannity and Earhart have signed long-term contracts to remain with Fox News Media. Earhart will continue to co-host “FOX & Friends” in New York, while the prime-time star will continue to host the show. “Hannity” is a show of the same name from Florida.\nEarhart and Hannity were both previously married, and she and her ex-spouse “are still good friends” and “we all support each other.”\n“In fact, we informed them in advance that this was happening,” they said.\nEarhart and her ex-husband have a friendly relationship and are “progressing well” in raising their daughter.\nHannity has continued to receive the highest ratings in his time slot for the past 15 years, making him the longest-running cable news host in history. A Fox News original, he joined the network when it launched in 1996 and previously served as co-host of “Hannity & Colmes.” In addition to his prime-time show, Hannity reaches millions of viewers with his hit radio show, which is syndicated to 750 stations across the United States.\nThe FOX News Media Spotlight Awards recognize team members who have gone above and beyond in 2024\nHannity recently added the new FOX Nation show “Shaun” to his portfolio. The show includes long-form interviews and debuted earlier this month featuring a sit-down with the iconic Sylvester Stallone and his wife Jennifer Flavin Stallone. He also recently hosted the 5th Annual FOX Nation “Patriot Awards,” which honors everyday heroes for their service and patriotism.\nEarhart joined the network in 2007 and has been co-host of “FOX & Friends” since 2016. This popular three-hour morning show has held the number one spot for more than 20 consecutive years. Earhart is the author of four New York Times bestselling books, including three No. 1 children's books, and also hosts Ainsley's Bible Study on FOX Nation. Earlier this year, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from the University of South Carolina for her professional accomplishments as a broadcast news and writer.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBrian Flood is a media editor/reporter for FOX News Digital.
