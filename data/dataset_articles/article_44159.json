  "text": "A man from Bihar spends 22 years carving through mountains to establish a shorter path between the village and its nearest hospital after his wife's death.\nLove knows no boundaries. It surpasses all human limitations and transforms ordinary individuals [into extraordinary beings](https://scoop.upworthy.com/food-delivery-rider-shows-extraordinary-bravery-by-jumping-off-bridge-to-save-a-woman-from-drowning) who break through impossible barriers. Dashrath Manjhi, fondly called the \"Mountain Man,\" is a prime example of someone who epitomized the profound truth of love through an [incredible act of determination](https://scoop.upworthy.com/20-year-old-redefines-determination-by-cycling-1500-km-from-italy-to-grandparents-house-in-england) for his late wife. While talking to [World Documentary HD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4_ex3ZB7S8), Manjhi revealed how his wife's unfortunate and untimely death turned his life upside down and motivated him to achieve the unbelievable.\nAfter his wife Falguni Devi's heartbreaking demise due to a lack of medical access because of the dangerous mountain, Manjhi embarked on an unbelievable journey. He single-handedly carved a 360-foot-long, 25-foot-wide passage through a rocky mountain to reduce the distance from 75 kilometers to 10 kilometers between his village and the nearest hospital. According to [My Modern Met, ](https://mymodernmet.com/dashrath-manjhi-mountain-man-path-carved/)Manjhi's wife fell from a mountain ridge in Gehlaur, Bihar, India, where the hospital was over 30 miles (approximately 48 km) away. While he saw his wife pass away from serious injuries, he was determined not to let anyone else lose their loved ones due to [inadequate medical assistance](https://scoop.upworthy.com/people-rally-around-doctor-who-refused-to-provide-medical-assistance-on-flight-for-a-valid-reason-ex1). That was how his journey to bring the hospital closer to his village by manually carving a path began.\n\"When I started hammering the hill, people called me a lunatic, but that steeled my resolve. Most villagers taunted me initially, but quite a few lent me support later by giving food and helping me buy my tools,\" Manjhi shared. With just a [hammer and a chisel](https://scoop.upworthy.com/people-cant-believe-granny-mistakenly-used-grenade-as-hammer-to-crack-walnuts-for-20-years), he worked tirelessly to reduce the distance that separated his village from essential services for 22 years. Manjhi's extreme dedication symbolizes the massive human determination that can turn an impossible challenge into a tangible path. \"I was sleeping beside a well. It was 12 in the night and I heard a voice from the sky asking me to break the mountain. Since then, I forgot to sleep. I started thinking about how to break the mountain,\" Manjhi shared with World Documentary HD.\nWith a twinkle in his eyes, Manjhi playfully reflected on his tremendous work and humorously suggested that had his wife been alive, he would have been preoccupied with pleasing her and possibly could not have accomplished such a task. \"If my wife was alive, I would have been busy pleasing her. How could I have done such a mammoth task? No, I am just joking,\" he added. Manjhi's legacy extends far [beyond carving the mountain](https://scoop.upworthy.com/everyones-grandmother-barbara-heralds-the-halloween-season-with-impressive-pumpkin-carving-hack). His determination was once again witnessed when he addressed the unstable river crossing that threatened villagers' lives.\n\"Do you see this river? We cross it every day to reach the market. During monsoons, it gets flooded. Once, I was crossing the river when I slipped and had a close escape from drowning. But that day, I thought how many must have drowned in this river. Then I started making a bridge on this,\" he revealed.\nWith exceptional dedication, Manjhi embarked on yet another astonishing journey, walking 1100 miles along railway lines to secure funding from the Indian government for bridge construction. It is important to note that Manjhi passed away on August 17, 2007, after [battling gallbladder cancer](https://scoop.upworthy.com/anchors-powerful-message-as-she-tearfully-admits-shes-battling-stage-3-breast-cancer-on-air-ex1) for a long time, as reported by [The Viewspaper](https://web.archive.org/web/20090227175828/http://theviewspaper.net/the-mountain-man/). After his demise, the local government built an official road over the path that Manjhi had carved through the mountain. Additionally, Manjhi was honored with a statue and a memorial in his hometown.",
