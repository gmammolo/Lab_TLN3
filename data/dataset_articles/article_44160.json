In a world that tends to quickly judge and dismiss, [offering a helping hand](https://scoop.upworthy.com/soft-robotic-glove-offers-a-helping-hand-to-those-relearning-to-play-piano-after-a-stroke) instead of making fun of someone's shortcomings can make all the difference. Kindness doesn’t require grand gestures; it reminds us that everyone has their struggles, and [a little compassion](https://scoop.upworthy.com/teachers-inspiring-act-of-compassion-for-mourning-student-ex1) can improve someone's life. Josh Cyganik, a track inspector for Union Pacific Railroad in Pendleton, Oregon, is a prime example of how empathy can bring joy into the world.\nIn 2015, [35-year-old](https://scoop.upworthy.com/this-35-year-old-mom-is-the-worlds-fastest-woman-victory-for-motherhood) Cyganik was working across the street from Leonard Bullock's house when he overheard two teenagers making harsh comments about the senior's residence. \"One called it the f*****g ugliest house I've ever seen and said it should be burned down,\" he shared with [BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/claudiakoerner/a-guy-gathered-volunteers-to-paint-an-old-mans-house-after-t). Notably, Cyganik was not the only one who overheard the distasteful comments. The [then-75-year-old](https://scoop.upworthy.com/75-year-old-homeless-womans-considerate-gesture-turns-her-life-upside-down-thanks-to-social-media-ex1) Bullock also overheard the teenagers' cruel words, which appeared to trouble him. Although the two men had never spoken beyond casual waves, they were familiar with each other.\nWe're proud of UP employee Josh Cyganik, who took action in his community. \"It's a matter of respect.\"\n— Union Pacific (@UnionPacific)[http://t.co/7F4nMkhcbK][August 6, 2015]\n\"I was brought up to treat people with respect, respect your elders. He didn't deserve that. I had to do something,\" Cyganik shared. Determined to help the senior, Cyganik arranged for paint by speaking to a friend at a local lumberyard. He then approached Bullock, asking if he could repaint his house. The elderly man was stunned by the offer. \"He was speechless,\" Cyganik recalled. To make his vision a reality, Cyganik turned to Facebook, initially hoping for a few railroad workers to join. To his surprise, over 100 people showed up to help give the house a [complete makeover](https://scoop.upworthy.com/homeless-man-reunited-with-family-after-ten-years-viral-makeover-photos).\n\"It was just overwhelming how people would come together to lend a hand to do something for Leonard; it's still hard for me to wrap my head around it,\" Cyganik revealed to [ABC7 Eyewitness News](https://abc7.com/josh-cyganik-union-pacific-oregon-man-paints-old-mans-house/919669/). After successfully giving Bullock's house a fresh makeover, Cyganik shared that the new coat of paint fills the older gentleman with pride every time he sits on his porch. \"Every time I see him, I wave to him still. He just smiles from ear to ear,\" Cyganik said. The heartwarming story of Cyganik's act of kindness grabbed a lot of [attention across the globe](https://scoop.upworthy.com/this-map-showing-etiquette-practices-in-different-countries-is-the-perfect-guide-for-travelers). \"For me, it was no big thing,\" the man said, reflecting on his thoughtful gesture for Bullock.\nCyganik expressed his happiness for having the opportunity to brighten someone's life in a world often filled with negativity. He also urged people not to hesitate in offering help whenever they have the chance. \"Don't be afraid to go out there and help them. Don't be afraid to take the first step, Cyganik shared. Interestingly, it took Cyganik four years of simple waves before he finally took the step to connect and build a compassionate relationship with Bullock. Since then, they’ve shared regular conversations, with Cyganik often checking in on the older man and offering support with other home [improvement projects.](https://scoop.upworthy.com/couple-gives-each-other-performance-improvement-plan-to-fix-their-relationship-sparking-debate)\nRemember Josh Cyganik, the Track Inspector who rallied people to paint a home?
