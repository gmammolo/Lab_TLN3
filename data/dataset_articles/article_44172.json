  "text": "NEW DELHI: Elevating the Veer Bal Diwas - the martyrdom day of Guru Gobind Singh's sons known as Sahibzadas - to a pan-India event, PM Narendra Modi on Thursday launched the 'Suposhit Gram Panchayat Abhiyan' to encourage healthy living and combat malnutrition while drawing a parallel between the Sahibzadas' valour and the ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The day, which celebrates the bravery of Sahibzadas Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh, who, at a tender age, faced the tyranny of the Mughal empire with unwavering faith and courage, saw 17 young achievers being honoured for their bravery, innovation, and contributions to science and technology, arts and sports. On the occasion of the third Veer Bal Diwas, Modi paid homage to the sacrifice of the Sahibzadas and underscored their enduring legacy as an inspiration for national unity and youth empowerment. \\\"The robust democracy that India takes pride in today is built on the foundation of the courage and sacrifices of the Sahibzadas,\\\" Modi said. Highlighting the Constitution's commitment to equality and welfare, he noted its resonance with the teachings of the Gurus. He stressed the transformative potential of the youth in shaping a developed India. Initiatives like the National Education Policy, Atal Tinkering Labs, and campaigns like Fit India and Khelo India were highlighted as steps to modernise education, foster innovation, and ensure a healthy, future-ready generation.The Suposhit Gram Panchayat campaign was launched to encourage healthy competition among villages, aiming for a nourished and prosperous India.",
