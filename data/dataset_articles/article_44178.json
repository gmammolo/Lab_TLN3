  "text": "Construction of the long-anticipated Miracle League Field in Tyler began in November. Crews have started dirt work, site preparation is in progress and plumbing is being installed section by section — bringing the project one step closer to completion each day.\n“We are hoping to have the field ready by the fall season, so that they can have fall ball,” said Leanne Robinette, Director of City of Tyler Parks and Recreation. “Everyone’s done a really great job partnering on the many moving parts and working together.”\nAfter nearly five years of discussions, fundraising and planning, the Miracle League of Tyler is set to bring an all-inclusive baseball field to Faulkner Park — the first state-of-the-art inclusive ballfield in Smith County.\nDifferent project managers are overseeing various aspects of the construction for the city, while parks and recreation is also managing specific portions of the project. The Miracle League of Tyler has its own contractors and representatives involved in the oversight. Bi-weekly meetings and on-site visits are being conducted to ensure all parties remain aligned and up to date.\nBuy Now Workers carefully level and treat the subgrade with cement to provide a durable foundation for the Miracle League Field in Tyler. (Katecey Harrell/ Tyler Morning Telegraph)\nBuren Reed, Capital Improvements Project Manager for the City of Tyler, oversees projects funded by the half-cent sales tax, including roads, streets, bridges, utilities, ball fields and facilities. He manages construction for these capital improvement projects.\nUntil now, families had to drive to Gregg County for their children with disabilities to join the sports league. This project will provide an accessible and welcoming environment where children and adults of all abilities can enjoy many sports.\nThe current stage of the project focuses on site preparation, which involves moving large amounts of earth. This includes removing dirt, bringing in new material and properly compacting it to create a stable foundation. The goal is to prepare the ground for key structures, such as the ball field, concession stand, bathrooms, and dugouts.\nThis ensures the subgrade can support the weight of the planned structures and their future use. The goal is to guarantee the longevity of the field by keeping it firm and level for years to come.\nBuy Now Crews work to install utilities at the Miracle League Field, bringing the project closer to completion. (Katecey Harrell/ Tyler Morning Telegraph)\nStrict guidelines are followed regarding flatness and minimal slopes and the field’s design aims to avoid obstacles and maintain compliance with ADA standards.\nThe subgrade is being treated with cement to create a firm, durable foundation that will last. This process involves adding concrete to the dirt and compacting it to ensure stability, while the entire area is backfilled and compacted to the highest standards.\nIn Smith County, about 9.1% of families have a child with mental and physical challenges that qualify for the Miracle League, Shannon Glenney, Miracle League of Tyler board member, said in a previous interview.\nThe complex will feature a rubberized field that accommodates wheelchairs and other assistive devices while helping to prevent injuries, accessible bleachers and restrooms and a concession stand to ensure everyone, regardless of their abilities, can participate.\nThe project has already moved into the next phase. Utilities are being installed for the bathroom, including sanitary sewers, and electrical work was set to begin this week. The building pad for the bathrooms is already prepared and ready for construction.\n“We are very excited to see it finally come to life,” Robinette said. “We are hopeful that in the future, that every park will have some sort of all-inclusive play equipment or field in it.”\nBuy Now The construction site for the Miracle League Field is secured with fencing and locked gates, ensuring the safety of both workers and the public. (Katecey Harrell/ Tyler Morning Telegraph)\nThe parking lot is sectioned off to separate public access from the construction area, ensuring safety for workers and the community. A superintendent is on-site at all times, and safety measures are in place, including secure fencing and locked gates at night.\n“We have had a little bit of rain that can slow some of the process down, but it hasn’t really been so much rain yet that it’s caused any kind of concern or delay,” Reed said.\nCompletion is anticipated at the end of Summer 2025.\n“We’re hoping that we will have a ribbon cutting in time for fall ball,” Robinette said.\n— Harrell can be reached at kharrell@tylerpaper.com .",
