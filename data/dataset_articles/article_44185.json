  "text": "Latest news about Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies. Your daily crypto news habit.\nThe Dogecoin price is replicating a bullish fractal from 2021, signaling the [potential for a price breakout](https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-breaks-out-of-a-bullish-chart-formation/amp/) to new highs. A crypto analyst has shared a price chart comparing this historically recurring fractal to Dogecoin’s current trajectory, [predicting a massive surge](https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoins-third-and-final-leap-analyst-highlights-potential-mid-august-peak/amp/) to new all-time highs by January.\nHistorical Fractal To Trigger Dogecoin Price Rally Above $4\nIn an X (formerly Twitter) [post](https://x.com/TATrader_Alan/status/1871823205708738568) on Wednesday, Trader Tardigrade, a prominent crypto trader and analyst, predicted that Dogecoin, the number one meme coin, could record an [explosive price rally ](https://bitcoinist.com/parabolic-rally-dogecoin-price/amp/)beyond $4 by January 2025. The analyst announced that Dogecoin is repeating a crucial fractal observed during its huge price pump in the 2021 bull run.\nHe presented two parallel charts comparing Dogecoin’s movements between 2020 and 2021 and that of 2024. The right side of the chart shows [Dogecoin’s price action](https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-rsi-90-again/amp/) in 2020, which led to a massive spike in January 2021.\nBefore this significant price surge, Dogecoin underwent a series of [consolidation patterns](https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-stuck-in-range/amp/). The blue triangle in the chart indicates a local peak, the green curve highlights a price recovery after a dip, and the orange arc represents a period of gradual consolidation.\nThese distinctive price movements culminated in a sharp breakout for Dogecoin, allowing it to skyrocket past $0.065 in January 2021.\nBased on Trader Tardigrade’s analysis, Dogecoin is repeating this bullish setup, with the same consolidating patterns appearing on its price chart. The blue triangle on the left side of the chart shows that Dogecoin has already formed an initial peak. Additionally, the green curve highlights a price recovery, and the orange arc signals a rounding consolidation pattern.\nIf these [bullish fractals](https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-fractal-points-ath/amp/) hold, Dogecoin could mirror its previous price action and experience a strong rally similar to the [2021 pump](https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-bullish-2021/amp/). Consequently, the analyst labeled January “the big bang month,” emphasizing its importance during this [bull market](https://bitcoinist.com/uaes-bitcoin-holdings-to-40-billion-as-bull-season/amp/). Trader Tardigrade predicts that if Dogecoin repeats the historical fractal, it could trigger a surge strong enough to propel the meme coin’s price above $4.\nAnalyst Predicts 570% Surge For Dogecoin\nCrypto analyst Javon Marks has also[ predicted](https://x.com/javontm1/status/1871995033685311804?s=46) a massive bull rally for Dogecoin, emphasizing the importance of [historically repeating patterns](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/if-history-repeats-dogecoin-has-potential-for-a-parabolic-rally-details/amp/) in determining the meme coin’s future trajectory. The analyst shared a chart outlining [Dogecoin’s price behavior](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/heres-why-dogecoin-is-poised-for-a-major-bullish-reversal/amp/) across three distinct cycles — Cycle 1, Cycle 2, and Cycle 3.\nEach cycle follows a similar consolidation pattern within a descending triangle, followed by a breakout that leads to a substantial price rally. Dogecoin surpassed the 1.618 [Fibonacci Extension level ](https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/dogecoin-path-to-23-fibonacci-extensions-hint-at-massive-upside-with-musk-trump-influence/amp/)during each cycle after successfully replicating the historical consolidation patterns.\nBased on this analysis, the current Dogecoin price action in Cycle 3 aligns with the recurring pattern. If this trend persists, Marks forecasts that Dogecoin could experience a massive surge of over 570%, potentially reaching $2.28 or higher.\nDisclaimer\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not reflect the views of Bitcoin Insider.
