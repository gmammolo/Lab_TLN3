  "text": "By Wes Woods II and Jorge L. Ortiz, Ventura County Star ,\n3 hours ago Most of California's Dungeness crab fishing will be able to return on Jan. 5.\nThe California Department of Fish and Wildlife announced on Dec. 20 that it will open commercial Dungeness crab fishing from the Sonoma/Mendocino county line to the U.S./Mexico border next month.\nThe crab, which attains a width of 9 inches across the back, is one of the largest edible crabs along the Pacific Coast, according to the department .\nThe official start time is 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 5.\nThe state has delayed the start of the commercial crab fishing season for the sixth year in a row. The reason is to protect endangered humpback whales from getting entangled in vertical fishing lines, which can result in injuries and death.\nThe area from the California/Oregon border to the Sonoma/Mendocino county line will open for Dungeness crab fishing 10 days later at 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 15, according to the department.\nThe delay in this area is due to the inability to conduct industry-sponsored crab meat quality testing, according to the department.\n\"Delays are difficult, and fisheries management is becoming increasingly complex,\" said Lisa Damrosch, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations in a statement . \"Commercial fishing representatives remain committed to being productive partners in finding workable, long-term solutions, and we very much appreciate CDFW’s hard work and commitment to collaborating with the industry to set an opening date that balances harvest opportunities with the need to reduce risks to marine mammals.\"\nWhy is the crabbing season delayed? The delay is meant to provide more time for the whales, who have built up blubber feeding off the shore, to migrate south for the winter.\nSurveys in October by the state in five of the state’s six fishing zones found 99 humpback whales one day in the zone encompassing San Francisco and 73 another day in the next zone south of the city, which includes Santa Cruz and Monterey. The numbers are considerably higher than the threshold of 20 in a zone that triggers a delay to the season’s opening.\nWes Woods II covers West County for the Ventura County Star.
