Two individuals and their dogs were rescued from rising flood waters while camping under the Oak Patch overpass along a section of the Fern Ridge Trail south of West 11th Avenue in Eugene during a thunderstorm early Thursday.\nThe Eugene-Springfield Fire Department responded to the scene around 1:15 a.m. and found fast-moving water from Wednesday night's thunderstorm encroaching on several tents in the area.\nWhile one individual was able to self-extricate, two others and their dogs were trapped inside their tents.\nFire Department officials said rescue teams worked quickly to deploy a ladder down the side of the slough and was able to turn the tents and safely extricate the individuals and their canine friends before the water overtook them.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement No injuries were immediately reported following the incident.\nHaleigh Kochanski is a breaking news and public safety reporter for The Register-Guard.
