  "text": "Kaavia James experienced what pretty much every adult has experienced this holiday season — the infuriating frustration that comes with knowing you know the right way to do something (stuff the turkey, wrap the presents, yada yada), and being downright ignored by your family. The 6-year-old looked like she might lose her mind in a new video where she’s gearing up to sing “The Twelve Days of Christmas” with her parents Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade .\n“You need to play the song,” she says to the adults who are listing off the lyrics and repeating them back to one another. Kaavia — who keeps throwing her head back, sighing, and rolling her eyes — is clearly thinking, “Why are we yapping when we could just get to singing?” Related story Kaavia James Models Matching Pjs With Her Mom Gabrielle Union in a New Video & She’s the Cutest Kid Influencer",
