  "text": "Henwood Park have unveiled their new Pascoe Cup coaching line-up for next season.\nAfter a couple of years away from senior football, Bryan Lucas and [Scott Rohrich](https://www.dailyadvertiser.com.au/story/7301134/wagga-united-search-for-the-right-combinations/) are taking on the job as co-coaches.\nThe pair have a fair bit of experience coaching at both junior and senior level and take over the role vacated by [Jake Ploenges.](https://www.dailyadvertiser.com.au/story/8251706/ploenges-to-coach-henwood-park-in-hopeful-return-to-pascoe-cup/)\nLucas said he was excited about taking on the role and working alongside Rohrich at the Hawks.\n\"I'm looking forward to it,\" Lucas said.\n\"Scott and I had a chat about getting into it together as we've both had a couple of years off.\n\"I'm really excited to get back into it.\"\nLucas revealed he's been thinking of getting back into senior football coaching for a couple of years and noted he believed the time was now right to step back into a top role.\n\"I've been looking to get back into it for a couple of years,\" he said.\n\"I've been helping a mate out at CSU with the Aussie Rules for a couple of years just to see what they do and learn about their program.\n\"I just thought this year was the right year and I'm ready to go.\"\nRohrich was also eager for the upcoming season and he noted that he and Lucas work extremely well with one another.\n\"We've coached previously with each other,\" Rohrich said.\n\"I first met Bryan when he coached my son, I came along just to watch games and I ended up getting dragged in along Bryan where we spent a good three years after that together.\n\"We found that we work really well together then after that we coached at different clubs and against each other which was quite amusing at times.\n\"We've got a bit of a background with the juniors, I've also coached senior women's for a couple of years then did one year coaching senior men.\n\"I then stepped away for three years I think it has been now, Bryan and I keep in touch and we've been talking about getting back into it on and off over a few beers.\n\"We had a few players approach us saying they wanted us back so we had a little talk and we've come over to the club.\n\"It's very exciting and I'm looking forward to it, we're getting the old coaching team back together.\n\"It's going to be fun and a few of the players we've coached over the years at Wanderers are either at this club or coming over to the club.\n\"We're going to know some faces and meet some new.\"\nWith their experience in coaching juniors, Lucas added they are extremely interested in making the most of Henwood Park's solid junior system.\n\"We're quite excited about bringing the juniors through,\" he said.\n\"This club has a great junior system and we want to be able to push them through and give them the tools to push themselves into senior football with the new 18's comp which should be good.\n\"Players that are looking to come back to the club or new players that want to join the club, we're more than happy to have a chat to them.\n\"Just reach out to one of us and we can go from there.\"\nHenwood Park senior vice president James Thompson was delighted to have Lucas and Rohrich on board for next season.\n\"After what Jake (Ploenges) did last year in building a foundation for the club I think it was pivotal that we got some good coaches in,\" Thompson said.\n\"Bryan and Scott have worked together for a number of years and they have good connections with some of the players at the club already.\n\"I think that's going to go a long way in building the club up from what it already has as well as bringing in other players as well.\"\nThe Hawks had a solid first season back in the Pascoe Cup competition in 2024 and Thompson was hoping to build on that progress next year.\n\"I think we built a very good team culture within the club and that's what we want to continue to build on,\" he said.\n\"Results last year may not have gone our way, but I think as a club and specifically as a first and reserve grade team we built off each other.\n\"I think that's a big credit to Jake (Ploenges) for last year and Bryan and Scott are the best candidates to keep pushing that forward in 2025.\"",
