  "text": "Mikal Bridges outdueled Victor Wembanyama in the fourth quarter on Wednesday afternoon, when Bridges scored 15 points in the period to lead the host New York Knicks to a 117-114 comeback win over Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs.\nBridges and Wembanyama combined to score 26 points in a fast-paced fourth quarter in which the teams combined for 60 points while shooting a collective 54.8 percent (23-of-42).\nBridges finished with a season-high 41 points - the second-most by a Knicks player on Christmas Day behind Bernard King’s 60-point effort in 1984.\nIt was the seventh 40-point game of Bridges’ career and his first since he had 42 points for the Brooklyn Nets on Jan 7, 2024.\nWembanyama had 42 points, 18 rebounds, four assists and four blocks in his Christmas Day debut.\nMiles McBride hit the tiebreaking 3-pointer with 2:43 left to give the Knicks the lead for good as the hosts won their season-high fifth in a row and improved to 15-4 since Nov 15.\nKarl-Anthony Towns scored 21 points with nine rebounds for New York and just missed his 19th straight double-double, while Josh Hart had 12 points and 12 rebounds.\nJalen Brunson finished with 20 points.\nJeremy Sochan had 21 points and nine rebounds for the Spurs, who fell to 5-6 this month. Chris Paul scored 13 points while Devin Vassell added 11 points.\nA chaotic and entertaining final 14 minutes began with the Knicks scoring the last 10 points of the third quarter to take an 88-83 lead. The Spurs then scored the first nine points of the fourth before Wembanyama outscored Bridges 7-6 during a span of 1:22. Tre Jones converted a three-point play to extend the Spurs’ lead to 102-94.\nBridges, Hart and OG Anunoby answered with three straight 3-pointers before the teams traded the lead on five consecutive trips. Hart’s tip-in of a Bridges miss put the Knicks up 109-106, after which Sochan tied the game for the final time with a 3-pointer with 3:04 left.\nMcBride answered with his tiebreaking basket to begin an 8-2 run for the Knicks. Paul sank a 25-footer with 42 seconds left, but Hart collected two offensive rebounds on the final possession as New York ran out the clock.\nNew York Knicks forward Mikal Bridges (right) reacts after hitting a three point shot in the fourth quarter against the San Antonio Spurs at Madison Square Garden.",
