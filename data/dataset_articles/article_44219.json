  "text": "NFL NFL News: Ravens QB Lamar Jackson reacts to career-high speed against Texans It was Lamar Jackson's record-setting speed that proved to be the difference against the Houston Texans. The Baltimore Ravens quarterback's career-best rushing performance propelled his team to a crucial victory in Week 17 in the NFL. Steelers make final decision about Russell Wilson's contract and future Bengals' Joe Burrow might be without a key weapon against the Broncos By Santiago Tovar\nDecember 26, 2024 04:39PM EDT\nDecember 26, 2024 04:39PM EDT\n© IMAGO / ZUMA Press Wire Owings Mills, Md, USA: Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson (8) during a practice session at the Under Armour Performance Center on Dec 23, 2024, in Owings Mills, Maryland. By Santiago Tovar\nBaltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson , renowned for his electric speed that disrupts game plans, outdid even himself during their recent matchup against the Houston Texans . Jackson, a player who stands out for his mobility among NFL quarterbacks, clocked the fastest speed of his career on the field.\nWhile official figures weren’t immediately available from the Ravens, reports suggest Jackson surpassed 21 miles per hour during his electrifying 48-yard touchdown run against Houston . This impressive feat not only shatters his personal record but further cements his status as one of the league’s fastest players, regardless of position.\nThe media, naturally intrigued, bombarded Jackson with questions about his record-breaking speed and its significance. However, his response was laced with humor, catching everyone by surprise. “I was jogging,” Jackson chuckled, then playfully redirected the question back to the reporters, “I didn’t have to do anything, but that was cool.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement This performance raises a crucial question: can Jackson maintain this explosive level of athleticism throughout the season? Given the grueling nature of NFL competition, staying healthy is absolutely critical.\nRavens Nation 𝙇𝙄𝙑𝙀\n@LIVERavenNation · Follow\nLAMAR JACKSON. MVP IS OVER. CROWN HIM.\nWatch on X 11:34 PM · Dec 25, 2024\n9.2K\nCopy link Read 180 replies",
