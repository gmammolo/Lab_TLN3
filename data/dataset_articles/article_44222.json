  "text": "President praises fellowship among citizens as society's basis during Christmas speech\nSalvador Illa calls for peace in his first Saint Stephen's Day address\nPresident Salvador Illa emphasized the importance of \"fellowship\" among Catalans, describing it as the foundation of \"any society, country, or democracy\" during his first Saint Stephen's Day address, delivered on Thursday at 9 pm.\n\"We must nurture our fellowship not only during these festive days but throughout the entire year,\" Illa urged, calling for unity among \"family members, neighbors, and regions.\" This is not the first time the Socialist president has [called for unity among Catalans](https://www.catalannews.com/politics/item/president-salvador-illa-speech-catalan-national-day-2024), after doing so in September.\nThe president also highlighted the importance of shared values, asserting that it is \"essential to strengthen what we share and celebrate our diversity, which enriches us as a society.\"\nEncouraging Catalans to take pride in their identity and achievements, Illa added, \"We should feel glad about who we are and what we have accomplished as a community. But let us remain humble and continue striving to bring out the best in ourselves.\"\nLooking ahead, Illa expressed hope for 2025, describing it as a year of \"promise and opportunity\" that should translate into \"better lives for everyone.\" However, he acknowledged the challenges that lie ahead and urged Catalans to reject divisive or hateful rhetoric.\nSaint Stephen's Day address is Salvador Illa's first [after he was named Catalan president on August 8](https://www.catalannews.com/podcast/item/podcast-new-socialist-cycle---whats-next-for-catalan-politics), following the May 12 election.\nPeace and solidarity\nReflecting on global conflicts such as those in Ukraine, Gaza, and Syria, Illa remarked, \"Peace means being able to sleep safely at home with your loved ones.\" He tied the Christmas season to the principles of Christianity and universal human rights, including peace and fraternity.\nThe president extended gratitude to public servants working during the festive season, saying, \"Thanks to their dedication, we can all enjoy this special time of year.\"\nHe also called for compassion toward those experiencing loneliness or hardship: \"Let us ensure that those facing undesired solitude or difficult times feel the warmth of our support.\"\nIn solidarity, Illa offered encouragement to residents of Valencia still recovering from the [DANA storm](https://www.catalannews.com/politics/item/king-felipe-vi-christmas-speech-2024) that caused widespread devastation two months ago. \"Catalonia will stand by Valencia until the very end,\" he pledged.\nIndependence, financial crisis, and Covid-19\nSalvador Illa's speech is the first by a socialist in over a decade since former president José Montilla lost to center-right-wing Convergència i Unió leader [Artur Mas in 2010](https://www.catalannews.com/politics/item/artur-mas-voted-the-129th-president-of-the-catalan-government).\nDuring the last decade-long, presidents have all addressed different issues, from Mas' \"more equalitarian finance deal with Spain\" to Carles Puigdemont's independence referendum, Quim Torra's Covid-19 pandemic, or more recently, Pere Aragonès' clarity act and negotiated independence.\nIn these last 13 years, Catalonia has lived through the 2014 independence non-binding vote on November 9, the self-determination referendum on October 1, 2017, and the Covid-19 pandemic. Additionally, there were early monetary cuts in public services due to the financial crisis of 2008 and some presidents being barred from holding public office.\nArtur Mas urged Spain to \"listen to Catalans and to let them vote\" during his 2013 New Year's speech, broadcast on December 30. Because of the crisis, he had been tackling financial issues in previous years. A year later, he accused Spain of wanting a \"weak, divided, and vulnerable\" Catalonia and said he would pursue the Catalans' desire to hold an independence referendum.\nHis last official speech was in 2015 after a Catalan election and before Carles Puigdemont was named president in early 2016.\nPuigdemont only got to make an official statement in 2016, as there had been an election in December 2017. During his official Christmas address, Puigdemont said he would enforce the result of the 2017 referendum \"with no delays nor excuses.\"\nAfter the [elections on December 21](https://www.catalannews.com/politics/item/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-catalan-election?), he gave an unofficial speech from Belgium, where he had been living [since leaving Spain](https://www.catalannews.com/politics/item/puigdemont-will-be-sworn-in-as-president-insists-jxcat) in late October.\nHis successor, Quim Torra, [tackled the Supreme Court ruling on pro-independence figures](https://www.catalannews.com/politics/item/torra-urges-spain-to-engage-in-credible-honest-and-bold-dialogue) for their involvement in the 2017 referendum, as well as [a future referendum](https://www.catalannews.com/politics/item/president-torra-sees-no-honest-dialogue-with-spain-without-a-referendum). After being barred from holding public office, Torra spoke from Girona in late 2020 on Spain's \"petty and interested Covid-19 pandemic management.\" It was also [an unofficial statement](https://www.catalannews.com/politics/item/february-14-election-formally-called-with-delay-not-ruled-out), as at the time, Pere Aragonès was the vice-president acting as president.\nDuring the last term, pro-independence Esquerra Republicana Pere Aragonès addressed the independence push and the confrontation with Spain during his Christmas speeches. He was the first president to change the date[ from December 30 to December 26](https://www.catalannews.com/politics/item/aragones-says-2022-to-bring-light-into-covid-19-darkness), coinciding with Saint Stephen's Day, a public holiday in Catalonia but not in the rest of Spain.\nAragonès discussed a negotiated independence referendum with Spanish authorities and [pursued the Clarity Act](https://www.catalannews.com/politics/item/catalan-government-to-launch-national-debate-in-2023-on-potential-independence-referendum) to establish the basis for this arranged vote.",
