  "text": "The question is, do babies born on December 25 get a Christmas and a birthday present? Or does one gift cover both?\nA lot of parents are going to have to figure that out after five babies were born on Christmas Day 2024 at the Launceston General Hospital.\nBeckett Riley was born at 3.30am on Christmas morning and weighed 3.118 kilograms.\nParents Tia and Shaun said Beckett's older sister was very happy to have a little brother on Christmas morning.\nThe first Christmas Day baby was Sadie Cowen, who was born at 12.15am and weighed 3.005 kilograms.\nParents Arianne and Aaron said they didn't expect a Christmas delivery.\n\"I thought I was going to have her out by Christmas Eve but pushing is harder than it looks,\" Arianne said.\n\"I can't top this present.\"\nFirst-time father Aaron was in awe of his daughter and couldn't wipe the smile off his face.\nAlso born on Christmas morning was Luca Cuttris who arrived at 9.25am and weighed 4.14 kilograms, making him the heaviest baby born on the day.\nParents Fhian and Taykyn were delighted with their son.\nTwo more came in the evening, at which point one staff member commented to The Examiner that it \"must be a record\".\nLGH maternity staff said five deliveries on Christmas Day was unusual and, most years there are no babies born on Christmas Day.",
