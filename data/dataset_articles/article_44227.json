  "text": "Love and lyrics: Oklahoma couple's rap vows go viral\nAn Oklahoma couple made headlines by reciting their wedding vows through rap, showcasing their unique bond as hip-hop artists.\nAaron and Mariah Sawyer decided to break tradition during their September wedding, held in their front yard, by surprising their 100 guests with a rap performance after reading their paper vows.\n\"She goes, 'Oh my God, oh my God, we should rap our wedding vows,'\" Aaron told Tulsa-area television station Fox 23.\nThe couple's vows quickly went viral, amassing over 10 million views on TikTok and Instagram. However, the response was mixed, with many comments turning negative.\nDespite the backlash, Mariah said, \"Even though people were hating on our wedding vows, we were still living our dreams as hip-hop artists. It fueled that fire, that passion, that drive to continue being our authentic selves.\"\nAaron added, \"It's a testament to how solid our love and relationship is because a lot of people can put a lot of stress on the relationship with negative comments.\"\nBoth Aaron and Mariah have faced criticism in their music careers before, with Mariah even deleting Instagram at times to avoid negativity.\nThe couple remains grateful for the attention, as it helps them gain recognition in the hip-hop scene. They plan to track and release their wedding vows as a song in the future.",
