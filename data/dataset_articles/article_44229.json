  "text": "Home » Stories » 2024 » December UB Greensfelder Attorney Emma Tomsick Accepted into Ladder Down Cleveland Class of 2025\nLaw Firm | Unsplash by Tingey Injury Law Firm\nBy Press Release Dec 26, 2024 UB Greensfelder LLP is pleased to announce that Associate Emma Tomsick has been accepted into the Ladder Down Cleveland Class of 2025. Tomsick was one of 28 attorneys accepted into the leadership, business development, and mentoring program created by women lawyers for women lawyers. Ladder Down Cleveland runs from January to November and includes women attorneys in private practice, solo practitioners, and in-house counsel at all levels of experience practicing in Northeast Ohio.\nIn her legal practice, Tomsick represents clients in employment and employee benefits matters, including defending employers in discrimination, harassment, restrictive covenant, retaliation, and wage and hour, and benefits litigation. She also helps clients manage labor relations, including addressing union campaigns, and represents broker-dealers and registered representatives in arbitrations before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Using her previous business litigation experience, Tomsick helps clients mitigate risks and, when necessary, defends them in court and arbitration. She has been named to Best Lawyers: Ones to Watch® in America for her work in commercial litigation.\nLaunched in 2019, Ladder Down Cleveland for Women Lawyers is part of the Ladder Down program created in 2012 in Arizona by two female lawyers who wanted to help increase the number of women in law firm leadership positions by giving them the tools to rise and hold the \"ladder down\" for other women to follow and climb.\nThe Ladder Down Cleveland program provides nearly 20 hours of coaching in the critical areas of leadership, business development and mentoring. In addition, law firm partners, in-house counsel, judges, and other women leaders engage with the class through a series of panel discussions and other events. The program also includes periodic accountability sessions, where the class members work in focused, small groups to create and execute their leadership and business development plans.\nOriginal source can be found here .\nORGANIZATIONS IN THIS STORY\nGreensfelder ORGANIZATIONS IN THIS STORY\nGreensfelder Most Popular 1 Former officer indicted for involvement in drug trafficking within correctional facilities 2 Correctional officer charged with conspiring in inmate assault 3 Indiana woman admits embezzling nearly $1.2 million from employer 4 Biden commutes sentence for son of onetime Mississippi lawyer who bribed judge 5 Keller Postman says Tubi's lawyers should be DQ'd; Case says firm files frivolous claims More News",
