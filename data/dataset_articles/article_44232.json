  "text": "Travis Kelce—who first rejected a suggestion that he review his girlfriend Taylor Swift’s favorite Christmas movie for his and brother Jason Kelce’s New Heights podcast—recently gave in to the idea.\nIn early December, Jason Kelce’s wife, Kylie Kelce called into the New Heights podcast to recommend that her husband and brother-in-law watch the 2003 Christmas movie classic Love Actually to review on the Film Club segment of their show.\nNeither Jason nor Travis Kelce were enthused by the prospect of watching the film, even though it’s reportedly Taylor Swift’s favorite Christmas movie—and a favorite of Kylie Kelce’s, too.\nForbes Blockbuster Musical ‘Wicked’ Gets Digital Streaming Premiere Date By Tim Lammers “Yeah, don’t f—-ing torture me; torture your husband,” Travis Kelce told his sister-in-law on the podcast (via The Daily Mail ). “I’m an innocent bystander here, Ky. Don’t f—-ing come for me.”\nBlockbuster Musical ‘Wicked’ Gets Digital Streaming Premiere Date Google User Data Purge Underway—What You Need To Know Dark Web Facial ID Farm Warning—Hackers Build Identity Fraud Database However, the Kelce brothers had a change of heart and recently watched Love Actually .\nThe duo reviewed the film—which features a huge ensemble cast including Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightley and Liam Neeson—during the Dec. 24 episode of the New Heights podcast.\nForbes Travis Kelce Calls Taylor Swift’s Favorite Christmas Movie ‘Torture’ By Tim Lammers In Love Actually, a group of loosely connected characters’ stories all intertwine around Christmastime in the U.K.\nSurprisingly, Travis Kelce gave the film a positive take at the beginning of the podcast despite his previous comments.\n“Jason, you might be the oddball out here. I actually enjoyed Love Actually ,” Travis Kelce told his brother.\nJason Kelce responded, “I will concede it’s not an unenjoyable movie to watch. My issue is the Christmas aspect of it and then … but the overall sentiments and lessons and overall values that it expunges—expounds—are absolutely horrendous.”\nTravis Kelce Admits ‘I Didn’t Feel Christmas At All’ In Taylor Swift’s Holiday Favorite Kylie Kelce, who joined her Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce on the podcast, held her ground before their full critique of Love Actually , noting, “I really do love the movie.”\nKylie Kelce did, however, have a sneaking suspicion about her husband’s take, “I can’t wait for him to sit her and s—t on the movie for 10 minutes.”\nAnd while the retired Philadelphia Eagles didn’t completely pan Love Actually , he did have some harsh observations about it.\nForbes 25 Big Movies Coming To Theaters In 2025 By Tim Lammers “ Love Actually may be the worst Christmas movie I’ve ever seen,” Jason Kelce said. “I don’t even know if it’s up for debate.”\nTravis Kelce then added, “I didn’t feel Christmas at all during the movie.”\n“There was zero Christmas spirit or anything resembling [it],” Jason Kelce continued.\nTravis Kelce agreed with his brother about the Christmas aspect of Love Actually , noting, “I enjoyed the movie … I just didn’t understand how much it really tied into Christmas.”\nForbes ‘A Complete Unknown’ Reviews: Are Critics In Tune With Bob Dylan Film? By Tim Lammers “Not only does it not tie into Christmas … It was the worst family values of all time tied into Christmas,” Jason Kelce said. “[They’re], like, bad people.”\nWhile Jason Kelce wasn’t a fan of Love Actually, he was album to take in a different form of entertainment on Christmas Day when Travis Kelce suited up for the first-ever NFL game on Netflix as his team, the Kansas City Chiefs, took on the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nTravis Kelce, who plays tight end, caught eight passes for 84 yards and scored a touchdown in the Chiefs’ victory over the Steelers, 29-10.\nForbes In Memoriam: Movie And TV Actors Who Died In 2024 By Tim Lammers",
