Valter Wiklund of our student partner at WOWL in Madawaska has the story.\nEarlier this year a Madawaska business decided to purchase the old Frasier Credit Union building on main street. Crown Lakes Realty owner Matt Dechaine took a moment to discuss his purchase.\n“So in the state of Maine if you want to run your own brokerage which is your own real estate agency, then you have to have your own office to do it. So last year we started out by renting an office but we always wanted to own our own so that we could develop it and you know try to have rental income beyond just our office so we had seen this building for sale, we actually had it listed ourselves and we got to the point where it seemed to fit our needs and we had the budget to renovate so we bought it earlier this year and you know it’s been great since.”\nHe also discussed his future plans.\n“So we’ve been fixing it up just to kind of one, look good enough for our business. It was empty for you know ten years before we bought it so there was a lot of dusting, cleaning, just getting the furnace going was a big job. But now that we’re getting settled in, we are trying to see who else might have some office needs. When we were looking for an office, we had a hard time finding a nice space for rent so I figured there’s gotta be that need for other people. So as we find people that want you know whether it’s an accountant, someone who works from home, a massage therapist, if they need a space we’ll show them what we got and you know one by one we’ll start getting the different offices filled up.”\nWhat are some of the community benefits with buying this building?\n“I think it’s a benefit for a couple of reasons. One is as you notice on main street there’s some buildings that are unoccupied, you know people aren’t in there, the front doesn’t look great, but its slowly been coming back so I’m really happy to be part of that sort of resurgence of main street in Madawaska. We got a coffee shop across the street, Bry’s Quick Stop has come back as Habib’s now, this building is coming back. So I think that’s great and then as for the extra space we’re providing, you know there’s a need for good office space and single practitioner space so the fact that we can provide what we needed a year ago you know, hopefully helps other people move into their own business.”\nFor WOWL, this is Valter Wiklund\nCopyright 2024 WAGM.
