  "text": "CANTON, N.C. (WLOS) — Many people stepped up during Helene to help fellow mountain residents, and now, some have been recognized by the State of North Carolina for going above and beyond.\nThe [Dogwood Award](https://ncdoj.gov/about-ncdoj/the-attorney-general/attorney-generals-dogwood-awards/) is reserved for people finding community solutions to challenges. The owner of WPTL Radio in Canton and the Canton Police Chief demonstrated that during Helene.\n“I got an email from Raleigh and[it] said: 'Congratulations, I've been chosen for the Dogwood Award,'\" said WPTL owner Terryll Evans.\nThe award from Attorney General and now Governor-elect Josh Stein came as a surprise to Evans.\n“I was thrilled and was very honored for my station,” she said.\n[GOVERNOR-ELECT JOSH STEIN HONORS STORM HEROES WITH DOGWOOD AWARDS IN ASHEVILLE](https://wlos.com/news/local/josh-stein-dogwood-awards-asheville-hurricane-helene-western-north-carolina-yancey-county-sheriff-chimney-rock-lake-lure-mayors-businesses-community)\nDuring Helene, power, internet and cell service were wiped out for many residents.\n“But they did have radios with batteries,” Evans said.\nSo, WPTL became a lifeline.\n\"We just stayed on 24/7 getting out the information as quickly as we received it: where to get food, where to go... 'Stay home right now. This is the best thing – please stay home.' Curfews, people then without power – they needed food, water, cleaning supplies, everything. If you were hurt, you could go here,\" said Evans on the station's broadcasts during Helene.\nThe radio station became the conduit for family members to find each other and relieve stress.\n[EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: GOVERNOR-ELECT JOSH STEIN VOWS TO PRIORITIZE WNC RECOVERY EFFORTS](https://wlos.com/news/local/exclusive-interview-governor-elect-josh-stein-vows-to-prioritize-wnc-recovery-efforts-asheville-western-north-carolina-compromise-committee)\nEvans was part of a group of Western North Carolina residents who contributed during the storm who were then given the Dogwood Award, including Canton Police Chief Scott Sluder. Stein says he has been instrumental in moving Canton forward and helping people live safer, happier lives.\n\"Although our town has faced great difficulty in the last few years, we, the whole town staff, strive daily to provide a safe place for our citizens and visitors,\" said Sluder.\n“They deserve the award just as much as anybody else,” Evans said.\nShe and fellow radio stations, KISS Country and WWNC, were also recognized for their service during Helene and named [grand marshals in Canton's Christmas parade](https://wlos.com/news/local/representatives-three-radio-stations-named-grand-marshals-canton-christmas-parade-helene-information-kiss-country-wwnc-wptl).\n“[It was] wonderful for all of us to be on that float together,” Evans said.\nIt is a recognition that a simpler, tried and true technology still transmits power.\n[DOGWOOD HEALTH TRUST ADDS $20M IN HELENE RELIEF FUNDING TO SURPASS $70M TOTAL](https://wlos.com/news/local/dogwood-health-trust-adds-20m-in-helene-relief-funding-to-surpass-70m-total)\n[It's] still a very important part of our way of life,” said Evans.\nRadio stations played a vital part during Helene, one that was award-worthy.\n“When you are the only radio station and the only means, that's the award we get – by helping,” said Evans.\nStein says Sluder navigated Canton during difficult times, and Evans, he says, provided comfort during a time of uncertainty.",
