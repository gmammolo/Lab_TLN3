  "text": "The resort town of Paracas, located in Pisco Province, Ica, is ready to host more than 60,000 visitors during the Christmas 2024 and New Year celebrations for 2025, says the president of The Peruvian Chamber of Tourism and Foreign Trade of Paracas (Capatur), Eduardo Jaúregui.\n“This confirms its status as one of Peru’s top tourist destinations, renowned not only for its beaches, radiant sunshine, the Ballestas Islands, and the Paracas National Reserve but also for its traditional seafood-based cuisine”, he said to Andina News Agency. Capatur reported that a week before Christmas, 70% of hotel capacity had been reserved, with expectations of full bookings in the following days.\n“This aligns with the sector’s forecast of closing 2024 with approximately 900,000 visitors, both domestic and international”, told Jáuregui Cabrera.\n“There is significant anticipation among local tourism businesses, operators, restaurants, craft vendors, wineries, and merchants to welcome tourists during Christmas, particularly for the traditional holiday dinner, and for the New Year’s Eve festivities”, explained.\nCruises Driving Tourism Growth\n\"We are growing thanks to the concerted efforts of the business sector investing in Paracas,\" Jáuregui stated.\n\"A key factor in attracting more international tourists is the cruise ship market. This year, we have received about 20 cruise ships, and we expect the arrival of 30 in 2025.\", added.\nHe explained that each cruise ship brings an average of 3,000 tourists from various countries. This influx generates bustling markets, featuring local folklore, crafts, and tastings of Pisco and wines.\nJáuregui noted that cruise arrivals also mobilize around 100 buses from Lima, transporting visitors to key attractions such as the Ballestas Islands, the Huacachina Oasis, and the Paracas National Reserve.\nHe added that in 2025, Paracas expects to surpass one million tourists, potentially exceeding that figure by 100,000 or more. However, these numbers could increase significantly if the \"Capitán FAP Renán Elías Olivera\" International Airport in Pisco becomes fully operational.\n\"This delay in the airport’s functionality has hindered tourism growth,\" he emphasized, reiterating ongoing calls to authorities for action. Despite these challenges, tourism activity in Paracas continues growing.\nWedding Tourism on the Rise in Paracas\nJáuregui also highlighted the growing popularity of Paracas as a destination for weddings, citing its peaceful environment, favorable climate, and stunning sunsets.\n\"Paracas is becoming a sought-after location for weddings. Recently, four weddings were held here. Just last week, additional ceremonies took place, mostly hosted by beachfront hotels\", he said.\nHe also explained that wedding tourism in Paracas is flourishing, largely due to its proximity to Lima and its extensive hotel infrastructure, which can accommodate family and guests.\nOn average, each wedding hosts around 200 attendees. Four weddings in one night can bring approximately 1,000 visitors. A wedding of this scale typically costs no less than 50,000 soles, excluding live music arrangements.\nMore in Andina:\n#AndinaEnglish Peru’s public investment of S/ 49.7 billion aims to boost decentralized development\n?? https://t.co/wYJi8otMMJ pic.twitter.com/w8zfcv0Ucl\n— Agencia Andina (@Agencia_Andina) December 26, 2024\n(END) JCB/ JMP / MDV",
