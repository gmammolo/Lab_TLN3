  "text": "Owner and lawyer, GBC Law\nAge 35\nWhat career highlight are you most proud of?\nTaking over GBC Law in 2022 was a defining career moment. It gave me the chance to breathe new life into an established firm by reshaping its mission, vision and core values to reflect a modern, people-centric approach. Balancing the demands of a busy law practice with learning the complexities of business ownership has pushed me to develop a new level of resilience and adaptability that I am very proud of. The transition into being a business owner has truly been a journey of personal and professional growth.\nWhat has been your toughest business or professional decision to date?\nChoosing to prioritize the firm’s needs over a loyal employee who had also become a close friend. Despite my emotional inclination to support them, I had to objectively assess the situation to protect the firm’s growth and team dynamics. Ultimately, I made the difficult choice to put the business’s long-term success first, even though it strained a personal relationship.\nHow do you lead?\nI aim to lead with compassion by emphasizing the importance of growth and development within my team. Empathy is central to my approach, as I believe that understanding my team members’ perspectives fosters a supportive environment. I strive to be a good listener, ensuring that everyone feels heard and valued. Additionally, I adapt my leadership style based on the specific situation, recognizing that different challenges require tailored approaches.\nWhat is the biggest lesson you’ve learned in business?\nYour level of achievement is directly tied to your willingness and ability to confront the challenges that accompany it. I have learned that success does not eliminate problems; rather, it requires us to develop greater skills in managing them. Embracing this perspective has encouraged me to view challenges as essential opportunities for growth.\nBest piece of advice ever received?\nFailing is critical to success. Each setback brings valuable lessons that help us grow. When we let go of the fear of failure and embrace it, we create space for innovation and creativity. Every misstep teaches us something new and leads us toward better choices and stronger strategies down the line. This perspective has really changed how I approach my goals and reminds me that every stumble along the way is just part of the journey to success.\nWhat is your definition of success?\nTo me, success is about fulfillment and impact. Success means setting meaningful goals that align with my values and pursuing them with passion and integrity. It’s about building authentic relationships, both personally and professionally, and creating a positive impact on those around me. I believe success also involves continuous growth and learning, adapting to challenges and remaining open to new opportunities. Ultimately, it’s about finding balance and joy in the journey while making a difference in the lives of others.\nWhat are you most passionate about outside of work?\nI am passionate about creating memorable experiences and sharing them with my friends and family—whether it’s a spontaneous weekend getaway, a milestone celebration or trying out a new restaurant for a dinner. I also have a deep love for travelling and learning about different cultures and perspectives. As well, I often seek out opportunities to get involved with my community. Currently, I am training my dog to be a certified St. John’s Ambulance therapy dog so that we can volunteer together.\nWhat’s left to accomplish?\nSo much more. As I continue to learn and evolve as a business owner, I aim to have a positive and meaningful impact on both my clients and the community. I am committed to making a difference in the legal industry by advocating for people-centric and authentic leadership, fostering a positive work culture, and empowering employee growth and development.\nIs there anyone you would like to thank or acknowledge?\nThank you to my friends and family for their unwavering support during challenging times; your encouragement has meant the world to me. I also want to acknowledge my incredible team at GBC Law for their trust and collaboration. Your dedication and hard work inspire me every day. Lastly, a special thank you to our loyal clients—your confidence in us has been a driving force behind our firm’s success. I am truly grateful to have such a strong support network.\nA personal motto, favourite phrase or saying that resonates with you?\nIf it’s meant to be, it will be\nA philanthropic, charitable or community cause or organization you support?\nBC SPCA\nWhat do you do to unwind, relax or de-stress?\nMove my body, listen to good music and cuddle my dog\nFavourite place in the province?\nSea to Sky Highway\nFavourite restaurant(s)?\nOsterio Savio Volpe, Nightingale, Sushi Bar Maumi\nA book or podcast you would recommend?\nDon’t Sweat The Small Stuff\nWhat is your best habit?\nDrinking a lot of water\nA B.C. business leader you admire?\nKathy Kinloch\nTell us one surprising or little-known fact about yourself.\nEven though I was born and raised in Toronto, I could not speak a single word of English on my first day of kindergarten",
