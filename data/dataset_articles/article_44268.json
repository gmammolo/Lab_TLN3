Meat is prepared in a custom-made smoker built by the pitmaster, and many people say the brisket is the best they've ever had. You order at the counter; choose your meat (brisket, pulled pork, turkey breast, house-made sausages, or ribs) by weight, then add on sides like smoky pinto beans, green chili born pudding, and tangy coleslaw. Kick back in the huge outdoor area and enjoy.\" See the full list at lovefood.com to read up on more of the tastiest barbecue joints around the country. In the mood for something sweet?
