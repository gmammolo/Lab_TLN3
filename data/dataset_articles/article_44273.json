  "text": "Emanny stopped by HOT 97 to talk with Nessa about his journey in music, life, and his new EP Before H3R. He opened up about the challenges of returning to the industry after a 10-year break, the loss of both his parents, and how these experiences shaped his music.\nEmanny shared how he used to practice interviews and discussed his frustrations with the music business, explaining how the politics of the industry made him fall out of love with it at one point. In their conversation, Emanny touched on his relationships, including the emotional story behind the cover of Before H3R, which features his ex—the one he describes as “the one that got away.”\nHe candidly admitted to a “forever cheat” that led to the end of their five-year relationship, but shared that they remain cordial. Emanny also spoke about his mentors, Jadakiss and Joe Budden, his growth as an entertainer, and how being on Joe Budden’s podcast has impacted him creatively. He also admits his thoughts on the podcast and spoke on the fight he and Ish had. He wrapped up by talking about fatherhood, life lessons from his late mother, and his efforts to enjoy life outside of music. Stream his EP Before H3R, out now!",
