([WDBJ](https://www.wdbj7.com/2024/12/25/two-killed-fiery-christmas-eve-crash/)/Gray News) – A fiery crash in Virginia on Christmas Eve left two adults dead, and a newborn baby was flown to a hospital.\nThe crash happened Tuesday afternoon on Chatham Road in Halifax County.\nVirginia State Police said the driver of a Jeep crossed the center line into oncoming traffic, and the driver of a Ford Explorer traveling in the opposite direction attempted to swerve out of the way.\nThe two vehicles collided head-on, police said.\nA good Samaritan and first responders pulled three people – including two adults and a 1-month-old baby – from the Jeep, which had caught fire.\nOfficials said the Jeep’s driver, identified as 22-year-old Danyelle Hankins, and passenger 30-year-old DaShawn White both died at the scene.\nThe 1-month-old infant was flown to the hospital, along with the driver of the Ford Explorer.
