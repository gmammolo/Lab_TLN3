  "text": "There was no sitting room, and barely any standing room, at TinyBrickOven on Thursday, a day after the South Baltimore pizza shop had originally been slated to close.\nThe post-Christmas full house was anticipated after the small Light Street pizza shop got a publicity boost and a $60,000 commitment on Monday from Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy. Jeff Taylor, owner of Westminster-based catering business Staglio Pizza, was in to assist TinyBrickOven owner William Fagg as the team made pies for customers.\n“His pies are amazing, his attitude’s amazing,” Fagg said of his pizza-tossing friend.\nFagg received the five-figure influx of cash after telling Portnoy that he would need roughly $60,000 to stay in business for the next year. Portnoy, a part-time pizza influencer reviewing the Federal Hill shop, replied that it was “done” before offering Fagg a handshake during his “one-bite” critique posted Monday.\nIt’s been like a “crazy firehose of positivity” since then, said Fagg, who described the past few days as a “pretty big love fest” at the pizza shop.\nWhat’s next for TinyBrickOven? Fagg has been seeking a liquor license for years after opening up the small New York-style pizza shop in 2019. While cooking pizzas during Thursday’s lunch rush, he said getting a license to serve beer and wine would mean “that we’d be on an even playing field” with competitors in South Baltimore.\nChief among the competition is Cross Street Market, which is located next door, and includes a pizza shop that can serve beer with its slices. Fagg said that he has nothing against the market or Pizza di Joey, but thinks that there should be room for his small business to compete.\nFagg, a Navy veteran, said that his pizzeria obtaining such a liquor permit hinges on not just the Baltimore City Board of Liquor License Commissioners, but also the state legislature. The Maryland General Assembly would need to pass legislation adjusting certain alcohol control rules before he can be granted an application, he said.\nAs he cooked pizzas on Thursday, Fagg noted that couldn’t completely wrap his head around the specifics of what the state legislation would entail. Federal Hill, already densely packed with noisy bars as well as residential buildings, is a notoriously difficult place to secure a license, and TinyBrickOven is located in a central area close to the main drag. The city’s liquor board did not return a request for comment on Thursday.\nThe pizzeria’s website urges supporters to contact Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson and Baltimore Del. Luke Clippinger, who did not return requests for comment on Thursday, about passing legislation needed to grant Fagg a beer and wine license. Fagg said he’s also pitched legislation that would create a “locals-only” liquor permit for small businesses to serve locally made beer and wine.\nThe $60,000 cash infusion from Portnoy should help the shop stay open for at least a year and get its license, Fagg said. His restaurant, previously on the brink of closing, is now eyeing its own commercial space .\nFagg’s restaurant is known for its involvement in the surrounding community, often running fundraisers for people in need. During the holiday season, the restaurant runs a “Pay-It-Forward Program” where donations help provide hot pizzas to struggling families and people experiencing homelessness.\nWho is Dave Portnoy? The local pizza shop’s booster, Dave Portnoy, is most widely known for the sports and pop culture media brand he founded, Barstool Sports. Starting as a weekly print publication in 2003, Barstool has grown into a national digital media empire churning out sports and pop culture content.\nPortnoy, who serves as Barstool’s president, has branded himself through a blunt, pizza- and sports-loving persona as “El Presidente.” He has a history of making misogynistic comments and using racist language , defending himself as “ uncancellable .” Portnoy recently lost a defamation lawsuit against Insider.com after the outlet published two reports citing women who accused Portnoy of sexual misconduct.\nOn top of being a major promoter of online sports betting, Portnoy, 47, is considered to be one of the pizza world’s biggest influencers . His “one bite” pizza reviews have enough reach to either rescue struggling pizza shops or kill business for good when he renders his score on a 0 to 10 scale, including decimals.\nHis verdict after taking multiple bites of a TinyBrickOven pie outside the Baltimore shop this week was a 7.9, praising the pizza’s “good undercarriage” and Fagg’s “upbeat” spirit.\n“There’s no way this place should be going out of business,” Portnoy said.\n“Cost me 60 dimes right there, but whatever,” Portnoy added as he left the shop, using an expletive while commenting that he’s a “nice” person.\nHave a news tip?
