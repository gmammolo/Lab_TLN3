  "text": "Heart of Lions have moved three points clear at the top of the Ghana Premier League table with a slim win over Young Apostles.\nThe Kpando-based side claimed a 1-0 home win over Young Apostles on match day 15.\nKwesi Pong scored the only goal of the game in the second half to ensure Lions kept their position at the top of the league table.\nYoung Apostles came into the game on the back of three winless games and were hoping to turn their fortunes around.\nHowever, they were denied a win with Lions condemning them to yet another defeat, their seventh of the season.\nThe two teams enjoyed a bright start to the game but it was the home side who threatened for the majority of the game.\nThe two teams went into the break with nothing to separate them.\nThe second half of the encounter was almost a similar story to that of the opening 45 minutes.\nWhen the game seemed to be heading for a draw, Lions found the breakthrough.\nPong found an opening and ensured his strike beat the Young Apostles goalkeeper, handing Lions a late win.\nThe wins means Bashir Hayford’s men, with a game more than Bibiani GoldStars, take a three point lead.",
