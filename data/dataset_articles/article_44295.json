  "text": "While Silicon Valley and Austin have long dominated America's technology landscape, a new powerhouse is emerging in an unexpected corner of Texas. This is where Texas A&M University is rapidly transforming College Station into one of the most promising up and coming tech hubs in the nation, with over $1.5 billion invested in research and development initiatives since 2020. The university serves as a catalyst for diverse economic growth and technological advancement across the southern United States through its complete approach to building a tech hub.\nThe Breakdown You Need To Know:\nWhen engineers come together with diverse perspectives , they can approach problems from new angles, find more creative solutions, and ultimately drive innovation forward. This is where Texas A&M’s college of engineering shines and has grown into a major economic growth engine over the years. Throughout the Brazos Valley region the university propels growth. Its influence reaches way beyond traditional academic boundaries and supports about one in every four jobs in the local area.\nAt the helm of this tech push for the region is the engineering school's unique and innovative approach that speaks directly to the diverse mindset of the campus. “We have developed several programs to encourage an entrepreneurial mindset among our students. These programs provide the foundations of entrepreneurship, such as a deep understanding of business and societal problems and iterative learning,” said Dr. Robert H. Bishop , Vice Chancellor for Engineering at Texas A&M University System to CultureBanx .\nInnovating College Station’s Economy:\nTexas A&M's entrepreneurial ecosystem draws industry innovation naturally. University start-ups and spin-off companies added $165.40 million to regional income and created 1,727 jobs. Specifically, the university’s economic effect reached $20.80 billion in FY 2021-22, supporting 244,650 jobs across the state.\n“Twelve years ago, the head of the higher education coordinating board said we were preparing too many engineers with our plans to double the number of engineering graduates. My response was, look out the window, everything you see was made by God or an engineer. There will always be a high demand for engineers,” said Texas A&M University System Chancellor, John Sharp.\nBlockbuster Musical ‘Wicked’ Gets Digital Streaming Premiere Date Google User Data Purge Underway—What You Need To Know It Took Nearly Two Years, But Large Numbers Of German-Made Leopard 1 Tanks Are Finally Arriving In Ukraine Other things the university has working in its favor include the fact that Texas is a business friendly state with modest regulations and affordable housing options. It has no income taxes spurring corporations like Tesla, Oracle and Hewlett Packard amongst others to move its headquarters to the area.\nEngineering Industry Change:\nProfessional engineering demographics could still be improved across the board with 13.7% of all engineers are women , while 86.3% are men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Also, the most common ethnicity of engineers is White at 67.9%, followed by Asian at 15.0%, Hispanic at 9.1% and Black 3.3%. The university heavily leans into its women engineering base and has one of the largest female engineering student populations in the country.\nAs part of its quest to turn College Station into the next great tech hub, the university has drawn several lessons from established tech ecosystems such as Silicon Valley’s relationship with Stanford. Partnerships like the recent $2 million Samsung Austin Semiconductor one aims to build a talent pipeline to support the growing semiconductor ecosystem in Central Texas will help the region establish a bigger tech foothold.\nDr. Bishop noted the bold outlook leadership has for the region and stated that “through the vision of Chancellor Sharp, and as part of the Texas A&M University System, the RELLIS Campus was created. It affords opportunities for research and technology expansion that may not be available for universities in urban settings such as the University of Texas at Austin.”\nWhat’s Next:\nThe university’s detailed approach to diversity of thought across engineering combines substantial economic benefits with breakthrough initiatives to create a self-sustaining ecosystem for technological advancement. This evolution shows that breakthrough excellence can thrive beyond traditional tech centers and create new opportunities for economic growth in unexpected places like Aggieland.",
