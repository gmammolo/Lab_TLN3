  "title": "The arrival of Poland's first two F-35A Husarz stealth fighters at Ebbing Air Base",
  "text": "Two days before Christmas, Poland has received two big gifts with wings: its first fifth-generation fighter aircraft.\nThe two aircraft, numbered 3501 and 3502, arrived at the Air National Guard (ANG) base in Ebbing , Arkansas, on Monday morning. They will be used there to train the first Polish F-35A pilots from January 2025 on the US base. Here you can see the video published by the ANG showing the landing of these fighters:\nIn 2000, the former conservative Polish government signed a contract to purchase 32 F-35A Lightning II fighters for the Polish Air Force . The Polish F-35s are of the conventional takeoff and landing variant for dry land runways, the same version used by the United States Air Force (USAF). The F-35s will replace two Soviet fighter models still in service in Poland: the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29 and the Sukhoi Su-22.\nOnce delivered to Poland, the F-35s will be deployed at two air bases: Łask (in central Poland, where F-16 fighters currently operate) and Świdwin (in the north-west of the country, from where Polish Su-22s currently fly).\nOn August 28, on the occasion of Święto Lotnictwa Polskiego (Polish Aviation Day), Lockheed Martin held the presentation of the first of these fighters, nicknamed \"Husarz\" , in honor of the famous Polish winged hussars - the best heavy cavalry of their time - who liberated the city of Vienna at the Battle of Kahlenberg in 1683, with a sweeping charge led by King John III Sobieski against the Ottoman forces.\nThese aircraft will be the Polish Air Force's first fifth-generation fighters, the first to be stealthy (i.e. with a very low radar signature that will allow them to go unnoticed), and they are also the first Polish military aircraft to carry the traditional Polish checkerboard pattern in a low-visibility version , i.e. in two shades of grey instead of the white and red colours of the Polish national flag, something that has sparked some debate in that country.",
