  "text": "Scholarship to Empower Future Indigenous Leaders in Sport and Education The Melbourne Cricket Education Academy (MCEA) and Cricket Victoria Foundation are proud to announce the launch of the Scott Boland Indigenous Scholarship in partnership with Australian and Victorian fast bowler and proud Gulidjan man, Scott Boland.\nThe new scholarship is designed to provide financial and personal support to Indigenous students pursuing a Dual Diploma in Business and Leadership & Management, with the goal of developing a career in the sports industry.\nThe Scott Boland Scholarship will cover annual tuition fees at MCEA (through the Skills First Aboriginal Access Fee Waiver program), RMIT student amenity fees, and material and learning fees. Funding has been secured through Cricket Victoria Foundation's partnership with the Australian Sports Foundation, the charitable fund for sport in Australia.\nIn addition to financial support, recipients will gain access to non-financial opportunities, including career development, opportunities to spend time with Scott and exposure to the operations of the sports industry through Cricket Victoria, Melbourne Stars, and Melbourne Renegades. Boland said the new scholarship was a proud moment for him.\n\"I am incredibly proud to put my name and support to this scholarship. It reflects my commitment to providing the next generation of Indigenous students and athletes with the opportunities they need to succeed. I look forward to supporting these students, sharing my experiences, and learning about their personal journeys.\"\nCricket Victoria Foundation Chair Paul Gardner AM welcomed the news.\n\"The Cricket Victoria Foundation's work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities continues to grow and this scholarship will help increase opportunities. I'd like to thank Scott for his support and desire to see this program grow in the years ahead,\" Gardner said.\nCricket Victoria CEO Nick Cummins added, \"This scholarship offers a unique and exciting opportunity for young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who want to make a mark in the world of business and sport. We look forward to seeing the students thrive in the program.\"\nRMIT Program Manager, Jeremy Glover added that \"RMIT we're proud to support this scholarship and it continued to reflect our longstanding commitment to empowering Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students to succeed in their studies, sport and life and head towards meaningful employment in an industry they are passionate about.\"\n[here](https://www.miragenews.com/boland-indigenous-scholarship-launched-by-1384807/).",
