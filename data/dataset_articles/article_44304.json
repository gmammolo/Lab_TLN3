On this solemn occasion, let us pledge to uphold the unity and integrity of the nation and strengthen the bond of brotherhood.”\nThe Lieutenant Governor urged the youth to honor the sacrifices of the brave Sahibzades and respect the legacy of Guru Gobind Singh Ji.

This co-existence has enriched and diversified our cultural heritage.”\nThe Lieutenant Governor also highlighted the significance of Lord Jesus Christ’s teachings in today’s world, particularly his emphasis on the brotherhood of mankind, harmony, selfless action, and the fight against discrimination. “Lord Jesus Christ’s life is a testament to love, non-violence, peace, and forgiveness, and his teachings are a source of inspiration for all humanity,” he concluded.\nMost Rev.
