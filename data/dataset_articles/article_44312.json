  "text": "The annual custom and ancient tradition of lighting the Hanukkah menorah takes on profound significance this year as Jewish communities worldwide face rising antisemitism . At the heart of this festival lies a powerful concept, referred to in the ancient Aramaic of the Talmud as pirsumei nisa , the obligation to publicize the miracle. But this commandment extends far beyond simply retelling an ancient story of military victory and miraculous oil that burned eight times longer than it was supposed to. It represents the Jewish people’s enduring mission to serve as a light unto the nations, even in the darkest of times.\nA story that I recently heard while I was on a trip to London beautifully illustrates this principle. A newly converted Jewish woman from Hungary, just three weeks into her Jewish journey, experienced what could have been a threatening moment. She was walking on her way to the synagogue on the first Shabbat after she converted when someone from a passing car rolled down their window and shouted “Jew!” at her. Instead of shrinking in fear, she paused and thought, “Oh yes, I am,” her heart swelling with pride in her new identity. This simple yet profound response embodies the spirit of Hanukkah: standing tall in our Jewish identity, transforming moments of darkness into opportunities for light.\nAnother telling anecdote comes from the former Soviet Union, where hecklers were constantly yelling, “Zhid! Zhid!” (Jew! Jew!) at a Jewish woman. She asked a Chabad rabbi whom she knew and who was more outwardly identifiable as a Jew how he endured constant insults. He told her that he saw such remarks as compliments and that it really didn’t often happen to him, seeing as they probably realized that he wouldn’t be insulted by their words. These stories teach us about the power of unwavering Jewish pride. This attitude doesn’t just deflect hatred — it transforms it.\nThe miracle of Hanukkah isn’t just about the oil that burned for eight days. The true miracle is the survival and thriving of the Jewish people against all odds throughout history. Like the Maccabees who refused to abandon their faith and values in the face of overwhelming pressure to assimilate, today’s Jews proudly continue to kindle their menorahs in windows and public spaces worldwide, declaring their unshakeable commitment to their heritage.\nThere’s a profound lesson in the physics of candlelight that perfectly captures the Jewish approach to spreading light in the world. When you share material possessions, such as apples, even though you are doing something good, you end up with less. But when you use one candle to light another, the original flame isn’t diminished. Instead, the total amount of light in the world increases. This principle perfectly encapsulates the Jewish mission of spreading the miracle. By sharing our light — our values, our wisdom, our kindness — we don’t diminish our own flame; we multiply the light in the world.\nAntisemitism has once again reared its ugly head in universities , streets, and social media, and this is indeed a challenging time in Jewish history, as our people are attacked on all fronts. It is specifically at this time that the message of Hanukkah becomes more relevant than ever. Each menorah lit in a window, each dreidel spun in public, and each proud display of Jewish identity serves as a powerful response to those who would prefer we hide in the shadows.\nThe obligation of spreading the miracle reminds us that our response to hatred and darkness must never be to dim our own light. Instead, we must shine brighter, stand taller, and continue our ancient mission of bringing light to the world. By doing so, we don’t just commemorate an ancient miracle, we become part of the miracle of Jewish survival and the triumph of light over darkness.\nRabbi Dov Ber Cohen is a senior lecturer at the Aish World Center in Jerusalem and founder and director of Living in Tune: Authentic Jewish Mindfulness .",
