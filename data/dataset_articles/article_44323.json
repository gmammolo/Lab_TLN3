By Jenna Herazo Published: Dec. 26, 2024 at 4:45 PM EST | Updated: 4 hours ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nCHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC) - A new recovery program for those who suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD, is coming to Charleston soon in an effort to help those struggling.\nAccording to the National Center for PTSD, seven out of every 100 veterans will experience symptoms of PTSD during their lifetime.\nSt. Timothy’s Anglican Catholic Church announced Thursday morning they’ll be launching the 12-week Deep Recovery Program starting Jan. 9.\nThe program targets those who have made the selfless decision to serve and protect our local communities, like veterans and first responders.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, data collected from 2019 to 2023 shows around 8,500 veterans live in the Charleston area.\nFather Jeffrey Monroe with St. Timothy’s Anglican Catholic Church said there are 12 spots open for those who would like to participate, however, it’s on a first come first serve basis.\n“It’ll be a program that focuses on individuals. Key thing to keep in mind with all of this is that it’s for veterans, obviously, but we also recognize that police, fire, nurses, EMTs, doctors, all of these folks generally will see the aspects that can trigger PTSD in them, and a lot of times they don’t recognize,” Father Monroe said.\nMonroe said although the program fundamentally focuses on veterans, it’s for anyone who’s experienced or thinks they’ve experienced PTSD.\n“One of the things that people don’t often recognize is we immediately think of veterans all the time, people who have been at sea, people who have faced war, people have seen death. But we also recognize that police, fire, our EMTs, and certainly doctors and nurses in the hospitals, they all experience the same thing, and it’s ongoing. Even we as priests, we see this. We see deaths in not only members of our congregations who pass away, but also with people who are facing struggles in their marriages dealing with alcoholism,” he said.\nAccording to the National Library of Medicine, 10% of first responders report having PTSD.\nMonroe said despite their occupation, participants will come together and focus on building a community that offers ongoing support.\nData from the National Center for PTSD shows PTSD is more common among female veterans and is three times more common among veterans who served a deployment.\nThe data reveals if you’re a veteran, the war you served in and the trauma you were exposed to all impact your risk of developing PTSD.\nAccording to the center, 29 out of 100 veterans who served in Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom will endure PTSD at some point in their lives- 15% of those who served during that period of time say they’ve experienced PTSD in the past year.\nMonroe said people who’ve experienced a traumatic situation will sometimes repress the memory, but he said holding in those emotions is unhealthy, and oftentimes leads to destructive habits.\n“So, all of these aspects are things that oftentimes get repressed. And what this is about is helping them to confront, to get repression and to confront what is causing this problem. The big issue we run into many times is people don’t recognize that they have PTSD. They’ve experienced something dramatic in their life, and all of a sudden, it keeps working away at them, and it affects their personalities, it affects who they are, it affects their relationships. They treat it sometimes with alcohol, they treat it with drugs, they treat it with everything except trying to confront it. That’s what this program is about,” he said.\nMonroe said the free course is an opportunity for people to open up, talk about their thoughts and feelings, and finally overcome their fears.\n“Every one of us faces some trauma in our lives, and we can’t suppress that. We have to face it, and that’s what this program is about, to help people in essence, confront what those fears are, and maybe rebuild their lives, or at least get beyond it so that they can really focus on their relationships, and also focus on their own personal mental health,” Monroe said.\nHe said both the church and an anonymous source are sponsoring the program. He added that the church will supply the materials, so all you have to worry about is showing up.\n“It comes with a workbook and obviously some videos and a trained facilitator. Basically, people have an opportunity to talk a little bit about what’s going on in their lives and also express some of the fears that they’ve had, including their repressed memories regarding PTSD,” Monroe said.\nHe said the program will start at 6:30 p.m. and most likely run until 8:00 p.m.- dinner will be provided.\nIf you’re interested in applying, you must do so before Jan. 6.\nMonroe said if there’s enough demand, they will run the program again sometime in the future.\nCopyright 2024 WCSC.
