Thanks to a matching gift, every donation will be matched dollar-for-dollar up to $5,000 per donation.\nKarl Pettit, acting director of Valley Mission, located at 442 N. Arthur Ave. in downtown Pocatello, said in the news release that it is important the roof be completed as soon as possible so Valley Mission will be able to be a shelter for people during the winter months.\n\"This is not just a building,\" Pettit said in the news release. \"It's a beacon of hope for people... who survive in their vehicles, on the streets or in tents during these cold months.\"\nThe fundraising campaign to finish the roof is part of the Avenues for Hope Housing Challenge, which will run until the end of this month.
