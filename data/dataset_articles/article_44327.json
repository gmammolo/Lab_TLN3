  "text": "By Sarah Tate ,\n3 hours ago Photo: golubovy/iStock/Getty Images Barbecue comes in many forms — ribs smoked for hours and slathered in sweet and smoky sauce, slow-cooked brisket covered in a flavorful dry rub, juicy pulled pork or shredded chicken perfect for crafting a delicious sandwich topped with slaw. Fortunately, there are plenty of incredible barbecue restaurants found all around the country that offer everyone the chance to dine on classic dishes.\nAccording to a list compiled by LoveFood , the \"best barbecue restaurant\" in all of South Carolina is Lewis Barbecue. This popular eatery serves Texas barbecue that is worth sampling alongside its Carolina-style counterpart. Lewis Barbecue has locations in Charleston and Greenville. Find out more by visiting the restaurant's website .\nHere's what the site had to say about the best \"unmissable\" barbecue in the state:\n\"At this popular joint, Texas barbecue is taken seriously. Meat is prepared in a custom-made smoker built by the pitmaster, and many people say the brisket is the best they've ever had. You order at the counter; choose your meat (brisket, pulled pork, turkey breast, house-made sausages, or ribs) by weight, then add on sides like smoky pinto beans, green chili born pudding, and tangy coleslaw. Kick back in the huge outdoor area and enjoy.\" See the full list at lovefood.com to read up on more of the tastiest barbecue joints around the country. In the mood for something sweet?
