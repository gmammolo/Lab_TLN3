  "text": "The Biles family is super close, and Christmas has always been a time for them to come together and celebrate as a family. But this year, Simone Biles switched things up. Instead of spending Christmas with the family, she decided to head to Chicago to be with her husband, Jonathan Owens.

While Biles is celebrating Christmas with Owens in a hotel room, the rest of the Biles family is sticking to their usual tradition!\nSo, Baby Biles, aka Ronni Louise Biles, who’s always hanging out with her “TT” (Aunt Simone), is spending Christmas down in Texas this year for her second one, and she’s loving every minute of it! Meanwhile, Simone’s sister, Adria Biles, who honestly looks like Biles’ twin, posted a sweet “Merry Christmas” message on her Instagram story.\nIn the video of her, Baby Biles is sitting on Adria’s lap, trying to say the alphabet but it comes out as pure gibberish. Then, their family dog hops in and starts nibbling on Adria’s hands. The best part? Adria and Baby Biles are wearing matching Christmas-themed pajamas. It’s too cute, especially since Baby Biles used to copy Simone’s outfits, but now she’s all about matching with Adria!
