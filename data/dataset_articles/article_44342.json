Courtesy Hapstance Films\nBy Kristi Turnquist | The Oregonian/OregonLive Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, the crime-solving characters created by author Arthur Conan Doyle, have inspired all sorts of interpretations, from movies to TV series. But the Portland-made “Fogtown” adds its own twist to the duo, presenting them as puppets.\nCreated and directed by Austin Hillebrecht and Sean Parker, “Fogtown” was conceived to be a potential TV series. The filmmakers have completed a pilot episode, “Mystery of the Moth Napper,” which had a Portland theatrical premiere in August, at PAM CUT’s Tomorrow Theater, the Southeast Portland venue operated by the Portland Art Museum’s Center for an Untold Tomorrow.\nThe journey to get “Fogtown” to reach more viewers -- and to generate support for the project -- is continuing, as the pilot episode is now available to watch online.",
