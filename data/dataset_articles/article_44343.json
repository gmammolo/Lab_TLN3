  "text": "Free Beacon Names Scott Jennings 2024 Person of the Year\n“Jennings might be the first normal dude who has ever been given a regular platform on a mainstream news channel.”\nThe Washington Free Beacon chose CNN’s Scott Jennings as the 2024 Person of the Year, for obvious reasons.\nI mean, Jennings is single-handedly saving CNN:\nSeriously, though. The fanatical resistance Jennings encountered over the course of the election was on par with Imperial Japan. Night after night, he faced down psychotic freaks who insisted to the bitter end that Joe Biden was fit to run for reelection, that Kamala Harris was a competent candidate, that slapping a camo hat on a prancing Tim Walz would help Democrats win back normal male voters. Few individuals did more to expose the alarming degree to which the liberal journalists who claim to speak for all Americans have become hopelessly detached from their fellow citizens.\nJennings might be the first normal dude who has ever been given a regular platform on a mainstream news channel. That would explain why his commentary, which accurately reflects what most Americans believe, is constantly melting the brains of his highly credentialed fellow panelists. Videos of Jennings schooling libs on CNN often\n[get more]views than CNN itself, which makes sense because the only people watching CNN these days are in the Joe Biden demographic when it comes to age and cognitive function, dozing off in the nursing home common room, or waiting for the hospice nurse to come change their adult diaper.\nWho could forget Jennings dismantling the left’s “Trump is Hitler” narrative?\nCNN's\n[@ScottJenningsKY]absolutely shredded this Trump/Hitler news cycle by the left and John Kelly.Scott's correct to point out the decades now of Republicans from George W. Bush to McCain to Paul Ryan and now Trump all being called Nazis by their opponents.\n[pic.twitter.com/yyE4MqRMIm]— Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck)\n[October 23, 2024]\nRemember when Jennings made the CNN panel gasp when he told them that most men of all races think Democrats care more about men who pretend to be females? He wasn’t wrong, considering the left hates men and blames them for everything.\nMe, on Harris’s problems w/ working class men of all races on\n[@cnn]: “Alot of men think Democrats care more about dudes who want to become women than they do about dudes just wanna be dudes. No amount of hunting cosplay or cringy videos is gonna change it. The bed is made.”[pic.twitter.com/X5BW2xJzOj]— Scott Jennings (@ScottJenningsKY)\n[October 13, 2024]\nYes, the antisemitism we’ve seen since October 7, 2023, has come from the left.\nThe progressive left is the source of the ugly anti-semitism in America since Oct 7 & everyone knows it. I was happy to point it out this morning on\n[@cnn].[pic.twitter.com/bExVI70oPe]— Scott Jennings (@ScottJenningsKY)\n[September 20, 2024]\nJennings pointed out the Democrats staged a coup against President Joe Biden.\nFolks, we need to take up for President Biden. The “party of democracy” is organizing an undemocratic coup against our President & we need to speak up for the very fabric of our Constitution. My latest tonight on\n[@cnn]w/[@abbydphillip]& friends.[pic.twitter.com/WdgITPmay1]— Scott Jennings (@ScottJenningsKY)\n[July 20, 2024]\nThe Free Beacon concluded:\nFor holding his own in hostile territory on a nightly basis, and for owning the libs on national television with a ruthlessness that few possess, Scott Jennings is a Washington Free Beacon Man of the Year. We never thought we’d say this, but we’re starting to hope CNN survives (at least a few more months) so we can keep watching.\nDONATE\nDonations tax deductible\nto the full extent allowed by law.",
