  "text": "By Casey Harper\nPensacola Police Officer Anthony Giorgio heard a puppy whimpering inside a vehicle Sunday when he decided to break in and save the dog, all of which was caught on his body camera. Giorgio said it was likely between 140 and 160 degrees inside the vehicle, ABC News reports. The owner got the puppy back but had to pay a fine.\nIn the body camera video, a few bystanders watch as the officer pulls out his baton and smashes the front passenger window, shattering the glass. The cop reaches inside to unlock the door.\n“Come here little guy,” Giorgio says before he retrieves the dog.\nA nearby good Samaritan offers a water bottle for the pup. The cop puts the dog in the front seat of his police car where the air conditioning can cool him down.\nFlorida enacted a new law in March that made it legal to break a car window to save a dog left in a hot car. As long as the person calls 911, makes sure the car isn’t unlocked, doesn’t do more damage than necessary, and waits for authorities to arrive, they cannot be sued for breaking in, the Miami Herald reports.\nThe Pensacola Police Department posted on Facebook warning others not to leave a dog in a hot car.\n“We will drive your pooch to the caring folks at the Escambia County Animal Shelter and we will drop you off with the caring folks at the Escambia County Detention Facility,” the department wrote.\nWATCH:\nSend tips to .\nFollow Casey on Twitter and like him on Facebook.",
