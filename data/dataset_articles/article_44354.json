  "text": "Updated: Dec. 26, 2024, 5:10 p.m. | Published: Dec. 26, 2024, 5:10 p.m.\nDetroit Lions right tackle Penei Sewell, left, and quarterback Jared Goff lead the team out of the tunnel before the game between the Detroit Lions and the Green Bay Packers on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024 at Ford Field. The Detroit Lions defeated the Green Bay Packers 34-31. (Jake May | MLive.com)\nBy Benjamin Raven | braven@mlive.com ALLEN PARK -- It’s hard to compete with new cars, expensive toys and fancy jewelry this time of the year.\nBut Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff did his best to show his appreciation for his offensive line. Goff said he got his big guys in the trenches a YETI cooler care package and a ton of beef for the holidays.\n“It’s hard when you got guys giving out Toyota trucks to try and keep up with that,” Goff told reporters on Thursday. “But I got them a nice YETI package with a ton of Wagyu -- steaks and beef. I hope they like it.”\nGoff’s mention of Toyota trucks comes on the heels of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy gifting his offensive linemen a new fleet of vehicles . In other gift news, Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts and running back Saquon Barkley joined forces to get their offensive line golf carts as a show of thanks.\nLast year, Goff got his offensive linemen $11,000 watches -- Breitling Super Chronomat watches -- while teaming up with Jared (the jeweler). Those also came with an inscription on the box that read:\n“Every second of this year was timeless. Thank you for a historic season and bringing gridiron glory back to Detroit. Enjoy this gift by Jared. From your Jared.”\nRelated: Lions insist veteran QB addition isn’t indicative of Hendon Hooker’s growth\nRelated: Lions’ focus on tuning out noise fuels streak of avoiding back-to-back losses\nKevin Zeitler said he was waiting to get his hands on that care package. But the Wisconsin native and veteran offensive lineman responded with a “Sign me up,” when asked about his present.\nDetroit’s offensive line remains the foundation of this team. They have taken some hits once again with injuries this year. But the starting five of Taylor Decker, Zeitler, Frank Ragnow, Graham Glasgow and Penei Sewell remains as good as it gets.\nThe Lions average 4.6 yards per rush attempt, ranking 10th in the NFL. Goff has been sacked 27 times on 472 passing attempts on the year, which ranks in the bottom half of the league among regular starting quarterbacks.\nPro Football Focus ranks Detroit’s offensive line 15th in pass protection and third overall on the ground. And from another perspective, ESPN analytics is higher on Detroit’s pass blocking, ranking them 10th in pass-block win rate.\nThe Lions also have some key standouts, with Sewell ranking fourth among offensive tackles, and Ragnow ranking third among centers, per PFF.\n“Yeah, I mean, they’re so dang tough, first of all, and the resiliency and that whole thing,” Goff recently said of the line. “But, obviously, they’re so talented and I’m lucky to be behind them. I don’t take it for granted.\n“You look around the league, a lot of guys are taking a lot of hits. I don’t have to be one of those guys, so it’s a fortunate thing to be in and I’ve got to them their credit.”\nBETTING: Check out our guide to the best Michigan sportsbooks , where our team of sports betting experts has reviewed the experience, payout speed, parlay options and quality of odds for multiple sportsbooks.
