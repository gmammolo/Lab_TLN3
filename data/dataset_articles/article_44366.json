  "text": "Forum for Dec. 26, 2024: A refugee story\nPublished: 12-26-2024 12:36 PM |\nA young woman, nine months pregnant, compelled by forces beyond her control to leave home and make an arduous journey to a foreign land, unsure of their welcome there.\nAt this time of year, those familiar with the Christmas story might imagine this young woman as Mary, “heavy with child,” traveling to Bethlehem, for a required census.\nIn fact, this is the story of someone who came to Vermont recently. She walked through the treacherous jungle of the Darien Gap and on to the US-Mexico border, all while many months pregnant, to seek asylum from the violence and hopelessness of her native land. This woman’s story is far too common, and one that at times has resulted in the death of the mother and her unborn child, either due to the terrible conditions of the journey or her treatment at the border.\nSince 2018, nine community-based organizations of the VT-NH Asylum Support Network have organized to welcome “strangers” much like this family. From Peterborough, N.H. to Burlington, and right here in the Upper Valley, residents have banded together to provide safe and warm places to stay, friendship and other assistance while new lives are built. Our new neighbors are working hard, contributing to our communities, and living in peace.\nWe ask that, together, we all welcome the newest immigrants to our country — whether refugee, asylum seeker, migrant worker, or some other designation — with generosity of spirit and the understanding that we — or others in our background — once were strangers here too.\nMartha Tecca\nOrford\nThe writer is writing on behalf of SHARe (Supporting and Helping Asylum-seekers and Refugees in the Upper Valley).\nFun on the Polar Express\nSanta was here this month when the Polar Express rolled into town! We volunteered as elves at the White River Junction train station. Many “Happy Holidays” were delivered to excited children, many of whom were dressed in their PJs. Hot cocoa was plentiful for everyone! Volunteers from all over the area took this weekend to help the Upper Valley kids have a day to remember.\nMy child was the first to get her “jingle bell” on the Comet train, which offered cookies, a book reading of Polar Express, and had friendly conductors and cooks. The holiday train singer with his amazing red and white outfit and light-up necklace ornament evoked Christmas in an instant.\nAs a single parent to my 7 -year-old, volunteering at Polar Express was a way to give my child an opportunity to see Santa and to get in the Christmas spirit. Paying the fee wasn’t in our budget. Our tickets were paid for unexpectedly by the Rotary Club. That act of giving to our family was what the true spirit of Christmas is about. Scarlett loved it!\nValerie Lynn\nWilder",
