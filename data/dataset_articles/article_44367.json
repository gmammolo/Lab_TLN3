  "text": "FALMOUTH, Maine — For many young musicians, recording in a professional studio can feel out of reach. As a singer-songwriter himself, Aedan MacDougall understands this firsthand. \"Studios can be so expensive,\" MacDougall explained. \"It can be $1,000 a day or more.\" But MacDougall and many other artists have found a creative sanctuary at Monaco Studios in Falmouth. Once a private home studio for Portland native Sam Monaco, it has been transformed into a hub for artists looking to hone their craft. After offering student discounts and seeing the impacts lowering cost-barriers can be, Monaco then founded the nonprofit Equal Measure Arts to continue that success. RELATED: Mobile Art Bus providing activities to families as a therapeutic outlet The nonprofit offers scholarships and mentoring through grants and community donations. Applications for its scholarships open in January 2025. The result is a judgement-free space for musicians and artists of all experience levels. \"Like, 'no dumb questions' kind of thing,\" Monaco added. \"Come in here if you want to learn about the process. We're happy to share our knowledge.\" RELATED: Where do songwriters get their inspiration? Sometimes the songs just pour out of them For artists like MacDougall, the impact has been immense. \"I've made a whole record here and have recorded a bunch of singles,\" he said. The nonprofit has already garnered support through community donations, allowing Monaco to continue nurturing the southern Maine music scene he grew up loving. \"It's really gratifying to come back as an adult and be able to give something back that can really sustain it into the future,\" Monaco shared.",
