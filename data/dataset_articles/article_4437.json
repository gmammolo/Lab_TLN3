  "text": "CEDARBURG — The Cedarburg Fire Department welcomed 13 members who joined in 2025.\nOf those who joined as active paid-on-call members and can respond to fire and EMS calls, there are four who joined already licensed/certified in EMS and/or the fire service. Two are currently completing their courses/testing to receive their licensure, and three are enrolled for EMT Basic or Fire 1 courses this spring semester at MATC.\nFour members joined as passive, which is a support role to help the department conduct fundraising events and public education for grade school students.\nThe department also runs an Explorer Post for students ages 14 to 18 (registered through the Scouting America program), which brought on four new high schoolers in 2025. The Explorer program prepares students for what it takes to pursue a career in both firefighting and EMS services.\nOne of CFD’s Explorers, who graduated and stayed in the area, joined the department as an active paid-on-call member.\nThe Fire Department also hired full-time firefighter/paramedic, Katrina Schoen. A member since 2022, Schoen responded to calls as an EMT/firefighter. She completed her paramedic course during the year upon being hired in December.\nFor more information on becoming a CFD paid on-call volunteer, contact the department at 262-375-7630 or go to cedarburgfiredept.com to fill out an application form.",
