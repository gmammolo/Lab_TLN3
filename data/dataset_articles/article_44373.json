Focusing on children and adults, making preventative care and wellness your priority, working with underserved populations, and even having your own practice are all possible with your new career. But, before you can practice, you need to pass the FNP board exam.\nStep one, let’s choose the FNP exam you’d like to take.\nYou’ve made it! You accessed all the top nurse practitioner student resources. You used the best tools for nurse practitioner students. You mastered your nurse practitioner coursework. You aced the NP school exams. You impressed your instructors with your clinical knowledge and bedside manner. So, what’s one more little test? Kidding! We know the FNP board exam – whether you’re taking the exam for the ANCC Family Nurse Practitioner Certification (FNP-BC™) certification or AANP Family Nurse Practitioner certification – is a big deal. That’s why we’re here to help.\nYou’ve got the passion, education, drive, vision, and skills to help patients. Teaming up with Picmonic for Nurse Practitioners will ensure you do well on the board exam standing between you and your dream career.\nFNP Board Exams: AANP or ANCC\nAmerican Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) and American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) official certifying boards. One exam is not necessarily better than the other. However, due to the historically higher AANP passing rate, the AANP exam was previously rumored to be the easier of the two.\nBut, numbers now tell us otherwise! In 2022, the ANCC passing rate was approximately 10% higher than the AANP. Other exam differences include the number of questions, time, and content distribution, but these are minimal. Below are the 2024 content outlines for both exams.\nANCC Outline:\n- Assessment (19%)\n- Diagnosis (17%)\n- Planning (19%)\n- Implementation (29%)\n- Evaluation (15%)\nAANP Outline:\n- Assess (32%)\n- Diagnose (26.5%)\n- Plan (26.5%)\n- Evaluate (15%)\nWhich FNP certification exam should I take?\nThe truth is, either the ANCC or the AANP FNP exams are widely accepted and weighted equally when hiring. There are slight differences between these exams including:\nAmerican Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) | American Association |\nQuestions: 175 – 200 | Questions: 150 |\nLength: Approximately 4 hours | Length: 3 hours |\n2022 Pass Rate: 86% | 2022 Pass Rate: 74% |\nIf you still want to know more about the ANCC and AANP? No worries, go ahead and dig into more of the format and content of each exam.\nHow to Pass the AANP and ANCC FNP Exams\nOkay, we promised tips for passing the FNP, but first, let’s get something out in the open. You are smart. You have studied for more hours than you can count. You’ve planned, practiced, and made lifelong friendships from study groups. We know you know a thing or two about taking and passing nursing exams. Now’s the time to give it all you have to pass this years FNP exam.\n1. Schedule your FNP exam studying\nPlan to start studying about six months before your FNP exam. This gives you time to plot a timeframe for different areas of the ANCC FNP Exam or the AANP FNP Exam, and also allows you to schedule time for the areas in which you need additional review. Don’t fret if your exam is sooner than six months, keep reading for great tips and we’ll get you there! The important thing is to take whatever time you have, and thoughtfully and realistically schedule your studying.\n2. There’s no wrong way to study\nIf it helps you learn, retain and actually use the information, how you learn doesn’t really matter. There are so many different studying formats for the FNP exam:\n- Elaborative interrogation – ask questions about the information such as, “Why?” “How do I know this is true?” “What makes this happen?”\n- Self-explanation – explain or teach the information to others\n- Studying before bed – research has shown your brain does some of its best work while you sleep and studying before falling asleep can help\n- Visual or Auditory learning – seeing or hearing the information to better comprehend and retain information, rather than reading it\nNo matter your FNP study method it’s important to forgive yourself for errors and learn from them. You will learn so much from mistakes and missteps, and when you learn how to work through them now, it will be a tremendous asset in your practice later.\nChances are, you may be a mix of different styles. Some days you may have great success studying one way, and another day, that method just isn’t working. Mix it up! Working with Picmonic’s Nurse Practitioner videos and spaced repetition quizzes can help prepare you regardless of your study format. Our research-proven mnemonic learning system helps you retain important course information by using auditory and visual reinforcement techniques. And you can access it day or night on your computer, tablet or phone; whenever you are ready to study.\nQuiz → Learn → Repeat Method for FNP Exam Studying\nIf you’re looking for a more specific plan for studying for your FNP, consider the Quiz → Learn → Repeat study model offered by combining the Family Nurse Practitioner Question Bank powered by TrueLearn with Picmonic. Turn weak areas into strengths and quickly zero in on what you need to review\nUsing this method you’ll create a schedule to take the 1,800+ FNP-style questions included in TrueLearn’s FNP question bank. When remediating the questions you answered incorrectly — and correctly for that matter — you’ll receive detailed explanations guiding you to the most important Picmonics to master. These in-depth explanations reinforce learning points to strengthen your understanding. And, of course, don’t forget to repeat this process daily!\n3. Practice, practice, practice!\nPractice exams take time and money, but there’s a reason you hear about them from everyone and every advice blog providing tips and techniques for successfully studying for the FNP (like this one); because they work!\nPractice exams give you the experience and confidence to approach each question efficiently. It will also help you build the stamina needed to complete the three- or four-hour exams. You can opt from full practice tests that, we’ve heard, can have some of the same questions as the exam.\nThe important thing is to get in a lot of practice questions (see above for a method for incorporating a highly-effective question bank with Picmonic).\nDoing practice questions and exams will set expectations for the ANCC or AANP FNP exams, and will help you know which areas to spend more time studying.\nGraduate Admissions\nBonus tip: Practice questions and exams are mapped to exam content so you’ll know what to expect. And, each organization offers an FNP blueprint, so you’ll know which are the highest-yield areas to study.\n4. Be the boss on exam day\nWhen the big day gets here, it’s only natural to be nervous, excited, anxious or have a little bit of an adrenaline rush. Stay as calm as possible. Take your time to read everything thoroughly. We mean it. If you are one of those people who get excited and rush through things (we are all “one of those people,” it’s okay), remind yourself to chill out! You’re in control, you’ve prepared for this day and you are going to do well.\nIf you used Picmonic you not only increased your retention by more than 300%, but you also joined the ranks of thousands of NP professionals who used Picmonic on their way to a successful career.\nThe exam results are available immediately upon completing the exam.
