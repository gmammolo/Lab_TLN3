  "text": "Summary\n- A Pokemon fan received a Christmas gift showcasing original Game Boy Pokemon games in a custom display case.\n- The gift includes all Gen 1 games and a Game Boy Color system, evoking nostalgia for fans of the series.\n- Nostalgia for Pokemon Red and Blue remains strong, as seen in fan creations and gifts.\nA Pokemon fan received a gift from their wife for Christmas that shows off a clever use of their old game cartridges of the original Game Boy titles and a unique way to display them on their wall. The gift showcases copies of every game in the first generation of [Pokemon](https://gamerant.com/tag/pokemon/) in a custom-made display case along with a Game Boy Color system adorned with icons from the franchise.\nPokemon as a franchise is over 28 years old, having debuted in 1996 with [Pokemon Red and Blue on the original Game Boy](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-red-blue-strongest-stats/), and quickly became a cultural icon when it eventually released internationally a couple of years later. Due to its massive popularity at the time, a lot of fans get nostalgic about their first time getting one of the games, especially on Christmas or a birthday.\n[Related\n](/pokemon-regi-fan-art-vegetable/)\n[\nPokemon Fan Designs Vegetable-Themed Regi\n](/pokemon-regi-fan-art-vegetable/)\nThe legendary Titans from Pokemon get a new member after a fan creates a veggie themed variant with a set of custom abilities and moves.\nThat feeling of nostalgia is exactly what Reddit user TheGarlicMonkey was reportedly after when they received a custom frame and display case for their old Pokemon games and Game Boy Color system for Christmas. The creation came from their wife and includes every game from [the first generation of Pokemon](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-red-blue-hd-unreal-engine-5/), serving as a nostalgic surprise for Christmas day, as per the user's request.\nPokemon Fan Gets A Dose Of Gen 1 Nostalgia For Christmas\nThe framed gift even includes a reproduction copy of [the Japanese-exclusive Pokemon Green](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-fan-makes-working-cartridges-of-crystal-and-green-for-nintendo-64/), which was never officially released internationally, which is reportedly a new addition to the fan's collection. Fans were quick to express praise and envy for the collection, stating how excited they would be to receive such a gift, while others shared their own anecdotes about getting the games when they were young.\nDespite how far the series has come since its original titles, the Kanto region from Pokemon Red and Blue continues to have a lasting legacy for the fanbase, with many pining nostalgically for the old days of the franchise. Creations like this and many others from fans can show the longevity of those original games and the impact they have seemingly had on the series, which continues to reference them to this day.\nIn fact, nostalgic Christmas surprises from the series don't stop there, as another fan received [a gift wrapped in paper from the classic Pokemon anime](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-nostalgic-classic-christmas-wrapping-paper/) series, featuring Ash, Brock, Misty, and Pikachu. Considering that the Kanto region from Pokemon Red and Blue continues to appear and get referenced in modern games, and the place it seems to have in many fans' hearts, it seems likely that its legacy will continue to go strong as the series moves forward.\n[\nPokemon\n](/tag/pokemon/)\nPokemon is a franchise that needs no introduction. One of the most successful media empires in history, Pokemon spans games, television, films, manga, merchandise, music, and more.\n- Created by\n- Satoshi Tajiri",
