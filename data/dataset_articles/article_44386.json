  "text": "The Los Angeles Dodgers re-acquired Kiké Hernández at the 2023 MLB trade deadline and wound up re-signing him to a one-year contract for the 2024 season.\nThe utility man struggled for most of the year but rose to the occasion to help the Dodgers win their eighth World Series title in franchise history.\nHernández hit .294/.357/.451 with one triple, two home runs and six RBI in 14 postseason games, including a 5-for-18 showing against the New York Yankees in the Fall Classic.\nHernández has been a fan favorite in his two stints with the Dodgers and said he wanted to repay everyone who supported him over the years, via “The Shop:”\n“From the moment I got to L.A., it was a humbling experience for me to have a fanbase that embraces me and loves me the way that they do. The support. I’m a guy that I’m probably a better player than what the back of my card says numbers-wise. I bring more to the table than my stats, and the way that they love me, you’d think that I am the best player on the field each and every day I step on a baseball field.\n“That is not even remotely close to being the case, but thank you. There’s nothing more that I appreciate than everything they throw my way. From the bottom of my heart, I’ve always said I never know how to repay this fanbase for the way that they love me, but this year, signing late, coming into Spring Training late and joining a team that has a lot of expectations, I figured the best way to repay this fanbase was when I get my chance in October, I do my thing and help this team win. I feel like I did just that.”\nHernández has been part of two World Series championships with the Dodgers, and each time played a big role in the postseason.\nHe is a career .278/.353/.522 hitter with seven doubles, two triples, 15 home runs and 35 RBI in 86 postseason games, 75 of which came with L.A.\nThe 33-year-old is now a free agent and made it clear that his preference is re-signing with the Dodgers.\nKiké Hernández enjoyed Dodgers fans embracing f-bomb interview Hernández’s home run against the San Diego Padres in Game 5 of the National League Division Series helped the Dodgers stave off elimination and continue their postseason journey.\nAfter the game, Hernández dropped an uncensored expletive during an interview with MLB insider Ken Rosenthal on live television.\nWhile it ruffled the feathers of some, Hernández thinks the moment added some fun to the Dodgers’ postseason run because of how the fans took to it.\nHave you subscribed to the Dodger Blue YouTube channel ?
