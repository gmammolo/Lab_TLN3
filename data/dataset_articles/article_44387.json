  "text": "The Los Angeles Dodgers accomplished their offseason goal of adding at least one impact starting pitcher by signing Blake Snell to a five-year, $182 million contract.\nThe left-hander is set to join a 2025 rotation that should include former Tampa Bay Rays teammate Tyler Glasnow, Yoshinobu Yamamoto and eventually Shohei Ohtani.\nTony Gonsolin and Dustin May are also slated to return after missing the entire 2024 season while recovering from respective surgeries.\nAnother option should be Bobby Miller, who struggled mightily this year but showed promise during his rookie season in 2023. The Dodgers are also expected to re-sign longtime ace Clayton Kershaw.\nDuring an appearance on “The Chris Rose Rotation,” Glasnow expressed excitement for the potential of the 2025 Dodgers rotation:\n“It’s going to be fun. Snell, Shohei, Yama, Bobby, Kershaw. There’s so many people. It’s going to be insane. It’s going to be a really, really good rotation.”\nAs Glasnow pointed out, the Dodgers rotation is stacking up to be one of the most talented groups in all of baseball next year.\nThe aforementioned pitchers have combined for 17 All-Star Game appearances, five Cy Young Awards and four MVPs in their illustrious careers.\nGiven the injuries that plagued them last season, the Dodgers will be counting on more stability in their rotation as they look to repeat as World Series champions.\nTyler Glasnow ‘feels really good’ Glasnow was one of the Dodgers starters who missed a significant amount of time this year due to injury. The 31-year-old dealt with right elbow tendinitis and did not pitch again after Aug. 11.\nWhile there was some uncertainty over Glasnow potentially needing surgery this offseason, he revealed that his elbow has essentially healed on its own.\nIn a more recent update, Glasnow said he has resumed throwing for the first time since his season-ending injury.\nHave you subscribed to the Dodger Blue YouTube channel ?
