  "text": "Santa has raised thousands of pounds for Isle of Wight charities during his tour around towns, villages and events this festive season.\nFlying around the Island spreading festive cheer for the fourth year running, Santa's visits, organised by IW Round Table, brought smiles and excitement in the lead-up to the big day.\nMany will have spotted Santa at various locations across the Island and Christmas events, including Newport's Carnival Parade.\nSanta at Newport's Christmas Carnival Parade (Image: Pamela Parker)\nRecommended reading:\nNewport comes alive with festive cheer for Christmas Carnival Parade Hundreds of festive swimmers brave the chill on Boxing Day! In doing so, Round Table has raised over £4,000, with still more to come.\nThe final amount will be shared between three local good causes, the IW Brainy Bunch, Carers IW and the Alzheimer’s Cafe in Cowes.\nJames Metcalfe, IW Round Table’s lead organiser for the sleigh event, said: “We’ve been blown away with this year’s event, but there is still time to donate, so please head to our Facebook page and click on one of the donation links.”\nFind the IW Round Table Facebook page HERE. Mike Grist, chair of IW Round Table, added: “The organising committee would like to thank all of their main sponsors, our friends at Ryde Round Table and all the adults and children who walked with us and collected money on our behalf.\n“And also, to every person who put money in our buckets to pass on to these wonderful charities.”\nCharity Isle Of Wight",
