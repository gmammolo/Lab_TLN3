  "text": "Several sportspersons, including wrestlers and bodybuilders, joined the AAP in the presence of party chief Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday, giving a boost to the party ahead of the upcoming Delhi Assembly polls.\nKejriwal welcomed Tilak Raj, Rohit Dalal and Akshay Dilawari, who are associated with sports and fitness, at the AAP office and handed party scarves and caps to them.\n“I am very happy that Tilak Raj, Rohit Dalal, Akshay Dilwari, and around 70-80 bodybuilders and wrestlers are joining the AAP. It is very important for all of us to stay healthy. Without health, everything else becomes meaningless. Rohit, Tilak, and Akshay have represented India at various levels—national and international—in wrestling and other sports. They also train many young people and children in Delhi and inspire the general public to stay healthy by offering various types of training,” he said, promising that after retaining power in the capital, the AAP will work towards resolving the issues faced by sportspersons.\nKejriwal said in the coming days, many more gymnasium owners and sportspersons will join the party. Speaker of the outgoing Assembly Ram Niwas Goel said those who joined the AAP on Thursday have significant influence, especially in Delhi's gyms, and wanted to contribute to the party's mission.\nDalal praised the party's initiatives, such as free yoga classes and support for sports development, which inspired him to join it. \"The work done for sportspersons and gyms is commendable. I want to contribute to this mission,\" he added.\nTilakraj expressed optimism about the sporting fraternity's growing involvement in politics. \"Many players from Delhi are planning to join us. We are committed to working hard and strengthening the party,\" he said.\nThe AAP is aiming for a third consecutive full term in the Delhi polls and hoping that this strategic outreach to sports and fitness professionals will resonate with voters.",
