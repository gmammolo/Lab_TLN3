  "text": "The minor girl who went missing from Berasia, Bhopal, four years ago has been found. The police successfully located her and recorded her statement. The girl, now an adult, revealed that she had left with her lover voluntarily.\nThe two got married and now have a three-month-old child. In connection with the case, the police have arrested her husband and sent him to jail.\nAccording to Station In-Charge Arun Sharma, the girl, who was 16 at the time, went missing on November 11, 2020. The police had filed a kidnapping case against an unknown person after her disappearance. Despite extensive efforts, there were no clues about her whereabouts for the next four years. In an attempt to gather more information, the Superintendent of Police (SP) had announced a reward of Rs 2,000 for any information that could lead to her recovery.\nRecently, the police received a breakthrough when the missing girl's suspected companion contacted his family from an unknown number. With this lead, the police obtained the Call Data Record (CDR) of the number and discovered it was registered in Nagpur. This crucial information led the police to send a team to Nagpur, where they found the girl and her husband.\nThe girl's husband, who had been working in a hotel in Nagpur, was arrested. In her statement to the police, the girl explained that she had married the man after turning 18, and they now have a young child. The police are investigating further, and her husband has been charged and taken into custody for his role in the case. The case, which had puzzled the authorities for years, has finally been resolved, but questions remain about the circumstances surrounding the girl's disappearance and her relationship with the accused.",
