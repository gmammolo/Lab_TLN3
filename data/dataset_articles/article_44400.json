  "text": "Honey, Apricot, and Almond Goat Cheese Spread is the ultimate party appetizer! Perfect for holidays and cheese boards, this goat cheese appetizer will add a burst of color and a whole lot of deliciousness.\nTo me, appetizers are often more exciting than the main event. Entrees are great and dessert is just peachy, but to me the fun really lies in the pre-meal nosh.\nAt holiday gatherings, where everything from appetizers to desserts is in wondrous abundance, I’m often left with a choice to make. Do I fill up on appetizers? Beeline for the sweet stuff? Save room for roast turkey or ham?\nTrick question!!! It’s all about the apps!\nWhen I’m hosting a shindig, I always always always like to have some sort of cheese spread situation on hand. It feels far more civilized than noshing on a plate full of cubed cheese and is way less hazardous than a communal dip.\nDouble-dipping is not an option people. I repeat: not. an. option.\nMaking a cheese board, charcuterie board, or assorted appetizers for your next party? This gorgeous goat cheese spread should 100% be part of it! It’s fast and flavorful!\nHoney, Apricot, and Almond Goat Cheese Spread\nThis super simple cheese spread fits the bill. It’s creamy, cheesy, sweet, and salty… perfecto!\nI have a total weakness for pairing creamy goat cheese with sweet sticky preserves and toasty almonds, and it’s downright heavenly spread on crackers, bagel chips, fresh apple and pear slices, and flaky croissants.\nAs an added bonus, it only takes MINUTES to make! Let’s do this!\nHoney, Apricot, and Almond Goat Cheese Spread\nIngredients\n- 8 oz goat cheese or cream cheese\n- ⅓ cup lightly salted almonds\n- 4-5 dried apricots (chopped)\n- 2-3 tsp fresh chopped parsley or basil\n- 1/4-1/2 cup apricot preserves\n- honey for drizzling\nSERVE WITH:\n- an assortment of crackers\n- fresh sliced granny smith apple\nInstructions\n- Remove goat cheese from protective packaging and soften to room temperature.\n- Spread fresh preserves on a cheese tray or serving platter.\n- Place your almonds in a bag or between two sheets of paper towel and crush using a blunt object, like a glass olive oil bottle.\n- Next chop your apricots and mix together with the almonds and parsley.\n- Roll your goat cheese in the mixture, pressing gently to coat.\n- Set the goat cheese log atop the preserves and surround with crackers and fresh fruit.\n- Finish it off with a hearty drizzle of honey and you’re good to go!\nNotes\nNutrition\nmore craveable cheese topping combos:\n- cranberry sauce (or jam!) + dried cranberries + lightly salted almonds\n- fig preserves + golden raisins + honey roasted almonds\n- lightly salted almonds + crispy bacon + chopped green onion\nIf by some miracle you have a little leftover, it tastes absolutely divine spread on a toasted bagel or flakey bakery croissant the next morning with extra honey. Delicious!\nIf you get a chance to try this Honey, Apricot, and Almond Goat Cheese Spread, let me know!\nYou can leave me a comment here (LOVE checking those daily!) or tag @PEASandCRAYONS on Instagram so I can happy dance over your awesome appetizer creations! I can’t wait to see what you whip up!",
