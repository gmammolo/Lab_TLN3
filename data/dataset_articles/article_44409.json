  "title": "Sean Strickland shares Christmas reunion with former best friend after bitter public fallout as he prepares for UFC 312 title fight",
  "text": "Sean Strickland appears to have reunited with a close friend with whom he shared a bitter falling out last year.\nFor years, Strickland and Chris Curtis shared a bond that seemed unlikely at the best of times, and even co-hosted a podcast together. But eventually their differences became too much last year and they ended up having a public spat which resulted in the pair blocking each other on social media.\nHowever, a new social media post showed the pair standing next to one another smiling after taking to the mats on Christmas day. They are both preparing for big fights, Strickland at UFC 312 for the middleweight title against Dricus Du Plessis , and Curtis in two weeks against Roman Kopylov.\nWho is Sean Strickland? Get to know the controversial former UFC Middleweight champion Sean Strickland and Chris Curtis had bitter public falling out Last summer, after years of unlikely friendship, Sean Strickland and Chris Curtis had a very public blow-up that happened over social media. The pair are on completely opposite ends of the spectrum politically and socially, making their pairing always one that seemed doomed to struggle.\nHowever, they managed to maintain their bond for a long time, until what seemed to be a boiling point was reached over a training session. After Curtis blocked Strickland on social media, a fan asked what had happened between the pair.\nPhoto by Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images The former champion replied: “Weakness is cancer man, literally it spreads through the gym like a virus…. It effects everyone… I can be pretty hard. Probably too militant But Curt wanted to drill during sparring and I said no do it on your own time and his lost it. Very gay… Curt we miss you lol.”\nThis led to further public feuding, with Curtis writing a veiled tweet that many fans believed to be directed at his former pal. “For those wondering,” he wrote. “I believe there is a certain amount of respect that you give to those who support you.\n“When that respect is not reciprocated, it doesn’t matter who it is, those people can no longer be involved in your inner circle. It’s that simple. Life goes on guys.”\nSean Strickland and Chris Curtis feud caused rift in the gym The pair were teammates for years at Xtreme Couture in Las Vegas, but their relationship falling apart threatened to cause issues at the famed gym. Head coach Eric Nicksick explained that even his own mother was monitoring the feud on social media and making sure all was okay.\n“I remember them going back-and-forth on Twitter,” he explained during an appearance on the The Casuals MMA podcast. “And I’m like ‘on Twitter, you two idiots?’ Keep this s*** in-house, don’t put this out on Twitter, both of you.\n“My mom was like ‘is everything okay with Chris? Is Chris leaving the gym?’ I’m like ‘what are you talking about?’ For a while there I had to calm my mom down in the comments because mom will clap at somebody.\n“There’ll be 100 positive comments and one guy will say ‘yeah, that dude sucks’ and my mom will be like ‘excuse me, motherf***er’. I’m like ‘mom, you don’t have to do that’.”\nSean Strickland and Chris Curtis reunite in training photo However, it’s beginning to look as though the pair have mended their relationship, at least to the point where they can train together. After a few posts showing Curtis training at American Top Team, he was spotted on Christmas day working out at Xtreme Couture.\nView Instagram Post And in an Instagram photo shared by undefeated prospect Reese Watkins yesterday, he and Strickland were seen smiling and standing next to one another after a session. Alex Polizzi stood between them, but they were close together and appeared happy.\nWatkins captioned the photo: “Swing on sight order for all captured Santa Deniers. Merry Christmas.” He is also currently preparing for a fight; he takes on fellow unbeaten prospect Christopher Ewert at Fury FC’s 100th event on January 12 in Houston.\nWho is Dricus Du Plessis?
