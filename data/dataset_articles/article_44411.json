  "text": "Bryce Hall is supremely confident ahead of his Bare Knuckle FC showdown with ‘Baby Slice’ Kevin Ferguson Jr.\nBryce Hall emerged as the latest addition to influencer boxing when he debuted in the ring in June 2021. More than three years after his first appearance in the ring, Hall has a showdown with the son of a street-fighting legend on his radar for his return to Bare Knuckle FC.\nHall’s BKFC debut went superbly last year when he finished Gee Perez by doctor’s stoppage at BKFC 48. It was Hall’s first professional bare-knuckle fight and he solidified himself as another intriguing name on the BKFC roster.\nHall will return to the BKFC ring next month against Kevin Ferguson Jr., the son of MMA legend Kimbo Slice. Hall wants to put an end to Ferguson’s combat sports career and surpass him in the BKFC hierarchy.\nREAD MORE: Dana White names his four top MMA fighters including Jon Jones and other UFC legends Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images Bryce Hall sends a message to ‘Baby Slice’ ahead of BKFC return During a recent interview with DAZN , Hall sent a message to Ferguson and his vocal fanbase.\n“This time I’m going to solidify another major upset in BKFC history,” Hall said. “I apologize to all Kimbo Slice fans when I’m about to do to him.\n“I wanted to see Kimbo in person, and it’s just majorly disrespectful [he didn’t show up]. I have no words other than I’m going to do my thing on January 25th.”\nThe 32-year-old Ferguson didn’t appear for a scheduled face-to-face with Hall at BKFC Hollywood. His upcoming BKFC booking with Hall is his bare-knuckle boxing debut, after an MMA stint in Bellator and his professional boxing debut last year.\nFerguson is 3-3 in his MMA career and is still searching for his first victory in boxing. He lost to Okema Jibunor at MF & DAZN X Series 6 by second-round TKO.\nREAD MORE: Claressa Shields explains why she won’t take MMA fight with Cris Cyborg amid calls for crossover boxing clash Bryce Hall faces Kimbo Slice’s son at BKFC: KnuckleMania 5 Hall is an American media personality with over 23.6 million followers on TikTok, and a 3.29 million following on YouTube. He’s hinted that his upcoming match with Ferguson will be the last fight of his short-lived combat sports run.\nFerguson’s father, Kimbo Slice (Kevin Ferguson Sr.), is a street-fighting pioneer after his backyard brawls accumulated millions of views online. He also made a name for himself on The Ultimate Fighter 10, competing alongside the likes of Roy Nelson, Brendan Schaub, and Justin Wren.\nKimbo Slice made his UFC debut on the TUF 10 Finale, defeating Houston Alexander by unanimous decision. He lost to Matt Mitrone by second-round stoppage at UFC 113, his final fight with the promotion.\nHall is looking to steal the Slice spotlight at BKFC’s show in Philadelphia next month.\nREAD MORE: Sean Strickland shares Christmas reunion with former best friend after bitter public fallout as he prepares for UFC 312 title fight",
