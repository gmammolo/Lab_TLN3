  "text": "Just ahead of the year's end, an incredibly lucky lottery player in Australia scored a prize of more than one million dollars after trying his luck with a popular game.\nEarlier this week, The Lott, Australia's official lottery provider, announced that its Weekday Windfall draw on Monday saw two winning entries.\nOne of the winning entries belonged to a lottery player from Queensland, while the other one was to a person from New South Wales.\nA [press release](https://mediacentre.thelott.com/media-releases/holiday-joy-penhurst-grandfather-ushers-in-new-year-with-1-million-weekday-windfall-win/) from The Lott confirms that the New South Wales winning ticket is held by a Penshurst grandfather who recently visited the Lottery headquarters to claim his big prize.\nMatching correctly the winning numbers on Monday night's drawing 4485, the fortunate player scored an AU$1,002,459.70 jackpot.\nThe seasoned lottery player purchased their winning entry from The Lott's official website.\nMonday night's Weekday Windfall draw 4485 saw winning numbers 28, 15, 5, 26, 30 and 16, as well as supplementary numbers 14 and 9.\nRecently, the Penshurst grandfather, whose name was not publicly released, spoke to Lottery officials.\nThe man confirmed that he has played the lottery for more than three decades.\nWhile the [fortunate player](https://casino.guru/news/hot-picks/fortunate-lottery-player-in-north-carolina-turns-usd25-into-usd1-million--5852) quickly realized that he had just won AU$1m, he remained calm.\nSpeaking to officials from The Lott, the man said: \"I've got a big family with lots of grandkids and great-grandkids, so I dare say a lot will go to them.\"\nMoreover, the lottery player added: \"I actually used all family members' birthdays on my ticket, so it's a special win.\"\nRecalling his experience with lottery games, the Penshurst grandfather admitted that he remembered previously matching five winning numbers but never all six.\n\"I'm excited but I'm pretty calm. I won't do anything extravagant, just save it a bit and look after the kids,\" the [lottery player](https://casino.guru/news/hot-picks/novice-lottery-player-in-maryland-in-disbelief-after-usd50k-scratch-off-win-6450) added.\nRemembering his mother's words, the man said that she used to tell him that his family wasn't lucky with \"competitions and things.\"\nHowever, considering the recent windfall, the man said that this bad luck changed to good, adding that he hopes to see this luck stick to him.\n\"What a win for Christmas Eve. Thank you to everyone at The Lott,\" the lucky New South Wales resident said in conclusion.\nFor the fiscal year 2025, so far, there are 227 division one winning entries. Out of that total, some 61 entries belong to customers from New South Wales.\nImage credit: Pixabay.com",
