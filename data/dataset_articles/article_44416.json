  "text": "Other than Swedish meatballs and Christmas stollen, Swedish Christmas foods might not be something with which you’re all that familiar.\nHowever, after checking out the 15 tasty recipes, you’ll want to get much more acquainted with them.\nWANT TO SAVE THIS RECIPE?\nEnter your email below & we'll send it straight to your inbox.\nAnd luckily, there’s a little something for everyone on this list.\nWhether you’re in the mood for Swedish-style Christmas ham, Christmas caramels, or even beetroot salad, there are plenty of options on this list.\nSo keep reading if you’re looking for something sweet, savory, smoky, or spicy.\nYou’ll find a dish to suit your tastes, and you’ll love having a Swedish-inspired holiday feast!\nIf you aren’t sure where to start, try your hand at the St. Lucia saffron buns. They’re simply divine!\n15 Popular Swedish Christmas Dishes\n1. Jansson’s Frestelse Med Lax (Jansson’s Temptation with Salmon)\nI realize that the name of this recipe is quite the mouthful, so when people ask, you can just tell them you’re making “Swedish salmon casserole.”\nIt’s a hearty, complete meal in one dish, and it takes less than an hour to make. The ingredients are carefully chosen to maximize the salmon’s flavor.\nThe dill, butter, pepper, and peppercorns give it an excellent taste, and the breadcrumbs add a bit of crunchiness that really sets it off.\n2. Julskinka (Swedish-Style Christmas Ham)\nThe thing to remember about julskinka, or Swedish-style Christmas ham, is that it isn’t something you can make the night before Christmas.\nThe ingredients list is simple; all you’ll need is the ham and the ingredients to make the brine and glaze.\nHowever, the entire process for preparing and cooking the ham takes over 2 weeks!\nDon’t worry, though. That’s primarily idle time. The ham needs to soak in the brine for 14 days.\nThe actual cooking doesn’t take nearly as long – just an hour for every pound of ham.\nWANT TO SAVE THIS RECIPE?\nEnter your email below & we'll send it straight to your inbox.\nThe glaze is flavorful and gives the ham a crisp, fragrant, golden-brown skin, but the meat inside remains tender and pink, and the whole thing tastes phenomenal.\n3. Swedish Potato Sausage (Värmlandskorv Or Potatiskorv)\nSwedish potato sausage is succulent, wonderfully spiced (though not spicy), and filling.\nYou can serve it as an appetizer or as the main course.\nEither way, people will be sure to come back for more, so you might want to make an extra one just in case.\n4. Swedish Meatballs\nIf you love Ikea’s Swedish meatballs as much as I do, then this is the recipe for you.\nWith it, you can make the same thick, spicy meatballs with the yummy rich, creamy gravy.\nPlus, you can make enough to serve five people in under an hour, and it doesn’t take much longer to double the recipe and make enough for 10 people instead.\nSo, if you’re looking for a tasty, filling Christmas appetizer, give these Swedish meatballs a try.\n5. Cured Salmon Gravlax\nIt doesn’t get much simpler than this 10-minute recipe for cured salmon gravlax.\nJust be sure you don’t wait until the last minute because 10 minutes is just your hands-on time.\nYou’ll need to let the salmon chill in the refrigerator for several hours before it’s ready. It’s best to make it about a day and a half to 2 days ahead of time.\nIt has the perfect salty-but-not-too-salty, herby, and tangy flavor, and the fresh dill adds a nice kick, as well.\nServe it on crackers, toast, or rye bread with lemon wedges.\n6. St. Lucia Saffron Buns\nThese gorgeous, golden-yellow saffron buns are one of my very favorite options on this list. They’re perfect in every way.\nThey’ll take some time to make, but even if they took twice as long, they’d still be worth it for their light, airy texture and sweet, buttery flavor.\nNot to mention, they’re gorgeous!\n7. Delicious Mandelmusslor Recipe (Swedish Cookies)\nThese lovely cookies are a holiday staple in most Swedish households, and after just one bite, you’ll understand why.\nThey have a mild, sweet, and nutty flavor, and the tangy cream cheese filling and sugary jam complement them perfectly, but you can also enjoy them plain with a mug of hot chocolate.\nThere are plenty of other toppings you can try, too – chocolate, peanut butter, whipped cream, caramel, etc.\nYour options are limited only by your imagination.\n8. Swedish Christmas Caramels\nYou can make these fantastic Swedish caramels with just seven ingredients: ginger, heavy cream, honey, sugar, butter, orange zest, and flaky salt.\nThey’ll have the same texture, consistency, and color as traditional caramels, and while there’s a ton of caramel flavor there, as well, you’ll also get notes of the orange zest and ginger.\nPro tip: If you enjoy the flavor of salted caramel, you can add some salt into the mixture as it cooks instead of just waiting to put it on top as a garnish.\n9. Swedish Rice Pudding with Sour Cherries in Syrup\nThis holiday favorite is a pudding, porridge, and sweet treat topping all in one. It’s creamy and features intense holiday flavors like cinnamon, cardamom, sugar, and whipped cream.\nIt’s thick and has a consistency that isn’t for everyone. Still, if you don’t mind the texture of cottage cheese or oatmeal, you’ll probably enjoy this, as well.\nThe berries and jam add a tartness to the dish’s overall flavor, but if they’re too tangy for you, you can help tone them down with chocolate, caramels, or whatever else you like.\n10. Vegan Swedish Beetroot Salad\nIf you aren’t a fan of beets, then this vegan Swedish beetroot salad might not be something you’ll enjoy.\nIf you do like them, though, then this bright pink dish will be a genuine hit that’ll brighten up your table.\nIt’s effortless to make, requiring only 10 minutes and fewer than 10 ingredients (three of which are salt, pepper, and a parsley garnish).\nYou won’t have to do any cooking, and it pairs well with Swedish meatballs (or vegan meatballs), crackers, or anything else you want to serve with it.\n11. Swedish Midsummer Cake with Berries and Cream\nI realize that this is a Swedish midsummer cake, meaning it isn’t exactly in season around Christmas. However, just look at it. It’s stunning!\nRhubarb and custard recipe\nSo, if you can find the berries in the grocery store (which you should be able to do), then why not make it as a beautiful centerpiece for your Christmas dessert table?!\nI promise that no one will complain that it’s out of season, especially once they taste it.\n12. Swedish Almond Tart\nYou’ll only need seven ingredients for these simple Swedish tarts, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have a massive dose of flavor.\nThese crunchy tarts are buttery, nutty, and 100% luxurious. In no way does their simplicity negatively impact how much you’ll love them.\n13. Swedish Kanelbullar (Cinnamon Buns)\nIf you’re looking for a dessert that’ll really wow your guests, check out this recipe for Swedish kanelbullar.\nThey’re sweet and flavorful cinnamon buns, but they’re the prettiest ones you’ll ever see.\nThey also aren’t sticky and messy like traditional American cinnamon buns.\nInstead of a melted glaze on top, you’ll use an egg wash and a dusting of pearl sugar.\nThey take a bit of time to whip up, but everyone will love them.\n14. Pepparkakor (Swedish Ginger Cookies)\nIf you prefer your desserts with unique, complex flavors instead of tons of sugary sweetness, then you’ll enjoy pepparkakor cookies.\nThey’re similar to gingersnaps, but they’re thinner, spicier, and a bit less sweet.\nStill, if you enjoy crunchy cookies and the flavors of cinnamon, ginger, and cloves, you’ll be hooked on these.\nAnother great thing about them is how easy they are to make. You can easily have two dozen of them ready to serve in less than an hour.\n15. Cherry Swedish Tea Ring: “Christmas Stollen”\nI’m absolutely crazy about Swedish tea rings at Christmas because they look so much like festive Christmas wreaths (not to mention how amazing they taste).\nAnd despite their intricate design, they aren’t all that difficult to make. They’ll take a little over 3 hours, but a huge chunk of that (over 2 hours) is rising time.\nAnd the rings are so flavorful! The sticky icing is a fast favorite for everyone, but the cherry pie filling with almonds, cinnamon, and butter is just as wonderful.\nIf you’re a fan of cherry cream cheese danishes, that’s kind of what this tastes like, only without the cream cheese.\n15 Traditional Swedish Christmas Foods\nHave a Swedish holiday with these traditional Swedish Christmas foods. From ham to meatballs to caramels and cookies, these dishes are worth celebrating!\nIngredients\nJansson’s Frestelse Med Lax (Jansson’s Temptation with Salmon)\nInstructions\n- Select your favorite recipe.\n- Organize all the required ingredients.\n- Prep a Swedish Christmas food in 30 minutes or less!\nDid you like the recipe?\nClick on a star to rate it!\nAverage rating 5 / 5.
