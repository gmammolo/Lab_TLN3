And so we’re pretty excited about these little things.”\nThe local Albers family dropped off the handmade outfits to Cook’s during their seventh annual Prayer Bear drop off, donating 552 bears to the kids in the hospital.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Close\nThanks for signing up!\nWatch for us in your inbox.\nSubscribe Now\nDaily News Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
