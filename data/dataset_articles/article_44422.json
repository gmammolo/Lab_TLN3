In the aftermath of the pandemic and with rising inflation, many are struggling to make ends meet. For many, fresh produce is the first thing to fall off their grocery lists. This lack of nutritious food can be associated with a variety of adverse health and social outcomes that can affect nearly every aspect of one’s life. This is why Hawaiʻi Foodbank prioritizes the distribution of nutritious foods—particularly fresh fruits and vegetables.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement There are lots of ways that people in need can find help.\n“Those seeking assistance can go to the “Find Help” tab on our website, hawaiifoodbank.org/help, which has a food assistance finder with distribution locations, food pantries, and some of our program sites. The page also lists assistance links by island for those residing outside of Oʻahu. We and our network of over 200 agency partners are here to help you and your ʻohana, so please, do not hesitate to reach out for support,” Bartenstein said.\nYou might be surprised with how far a donation can go.\nFind more Hawaii, Oahu, Maui and Kauai news here “Monetary donations are a great way to support Hawaiʻi Foodbank. It allows us to purchase exactly what we need, and with our deep discounts, we are able to purchase food in larger quantities at a lower cost than the average person at a regular grocery store. A donation of just $25 can help us to provide food for more than 40 meals. In addition to monetary donations, you can volunteer, host a food drive, donate food, and advocate. For a list of ways you can support, visit our website at www.hawaiifoodbank.org.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
