  "text": "By Jon Rudder ,\n4 hours ago\nLOWELLVILLE, Ohio (WKBN) — The day after Christmas isn’t always the best day to hit the links, but with some peeks of sun and warmer temperatures, it made for the perfect day to try out a new set of sticks that Santa dropped off.\nFirst News found a handful of golfers squeezing a round in Thursday afternoon. Knoll Run in Lowellville is one of the few courses that’s open year-round, and they say if there’s now snow on the greens, it’s fair game.\nGolf pros said with warmer temperatures on tap this weekend, tee times are already filling up.\n“Typically it’s very quick,” said Michael Shulas, Knoll Run PGA Pro. “They start watching the weather. For tomorrow already, I’ve got almost 70 golfers. For Saturday we’re nearly at 100. So it’s very fast.”\nShulas says they typically get a few diehards who brave the cold to get in a round in every month of the calendar year.\nDave Tabak and his two buddies Tom and Jeff are three of the regulars that roam around Knoll Run. If the course is open, they’re ready to tee it up.\n“You could have the worst day in the world on the golf course and one or two swings will bring you back every time,” Tabak said. “The old saying is, a bad day at the golf course is better than a good day in the office.”\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
