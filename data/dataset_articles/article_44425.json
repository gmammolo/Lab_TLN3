  "text": "Daniel Cormier gave high praise to a UFC lightweight contender he once pleaded to walk away from fighting after a past losing skid.\nDaniel Cormier isn’t one to mince words when it comes to his opinions on various MMA-related topics. As 2024 draws to a close, Cormier gave superb credit to a fighter he once called to retire after a series of struggles in the cage.\nThere are many intriguing cases for who deserves the UFC’s ‘Most Improved’ award after another eventful calendar year inside the Octagon. Renato Moicano, Kayla Harrison , and others have set themselves apart from the pack despite some initially low expectations to begin 2024.\nFor Cormier, one name sticks out as his ‘Most Improved’ after a sudden ascent into the lightweight Top 5.\nREAD MORE: ‘I apologize to all Kimbo Slice fans’…Tik Tok star Bryce Hall vows to land upset in BKFC comeback against legend’s son Photo by Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC Daniel Cormier honors Dan Hooker with ‘Most Improved’ title During a recent episode of Good Guy/Bad Guy , Cormier named Dan Hooker as his ‘Most Improved Fighter’ of 2024.\n“At least to me, it’s unquestionable,” Cormier began on Hooker. “A couple of years ago…I was talking about him like he needs to be done! He’s not good anymore, this guy’s fighting through the pandemic more than anybody else. He’s losing to Chandler, Poirier, Makhachev, and Arnold Allen, and the fights aren’t getting competitive.\n“Dan dyes his hair yellow, unbelievable tattoos, and comes back as the predator! Beats Gamrot,” Cormier continued. “Made the necessary changes to extend his career. For me, it’s Dan Hooker all day, and he’s on the verge of one of the biggest fights he’s had in his entire life. Finding himself in those [great] positions today though, because he’s winning and beating the best in the world.”\nHooker is on a three-fight winning streak following a skid of four losses in five previous fights. He most recently defeated Mateusz Gamrot by split decision at UFC 305 to earn a Top 5 slot in the lightweight division.\nAfter a failed featherweight return , Hooker has found a revitalized spirit since returning to 155lbs. He’s in the mix for a potential showdown with Conor McGregor after the former two-division champion hinted at a future fight in an exclusive interview with Bloody Elbow .\nREAD MORE: Sean Strickland shares Christmas reunion with former best friend after bitter public fallout as he prepares for UFC 312 title fight Dan Hooker is knocking on the door of a potential title shot Before the victory over Gamrot, Hooker earned back-to-back wins over Claudio Puelles and Jalin Turner. During his promotional tenure, Hooker notched victories against the likes of Al Iaquinta, Paul Felder, and Gilbert Burns.\nHooker is inching closer to a potential rematch with current UFC lightweight titleholder Islam Makhachev . After taking a short-notice gamble at UFC 267, Hooker fell to Makhachev by first-round submission.\nAs Hooker looks ahead to 2025 and beyond, he’s on the cusp of a world title shot and will look to add another belt to City Kickboxing.\nREAD MORE: Tommy Fury ripped by MMA legends after absurd Darren Till fight pullout over press conference jibe",
