  "text": "Nashik: Wineries in the city and tourist sites are teeming with tourists because of the Christmas season and upcoming New Year.All rooms in resorts of prominent wineries and all hotels across Nashik city-Igatpuri-Trimbakeshwar areas are 100% booked till Jan 4 next year.Wineries said that the footfall of tourists has doubled since Saturday.The Boat Club of Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC), located on the backwaters of Gangapur Dam, is also drawing tourists. The Boat Club was closed for the past five months since July 31 and reopened on Dec 24.Usually, the rides at the boat club are stopped during the rainy season from July 15 to Oct 15. But this year, MTDC stopped boat rides at the club from July 1 due to low water level in the dam. Later, it could not get the Water Resources Department's (WRD) nod to restart the club due to model code of conduct in place for assembly polls.\\\"We have started boat club rides from Tuesday (Dec 24). Most tourists don't know whether the boat rides have started. But the footfall will increase in the next few days as more tourists come to know about it,\\\" said an MTDC official.The Nashik city-Trimbakeshwar-Igatpuri belt has around 2,000 hotels offering 45,000 rooms, alongside 1,000 farmhouses with 6,000 rooms. All the rooms in the wineries and hotels in and around Nashik city have been booked 100% till January 4, said Datta Bhalerao, chairman, tourism committee of Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture (MACCIA).Nashik is drawing tourists not only from Mumbai and Pune but also Gujarat, Karnataka, and other states in the country. It has also become easier for tourists to travel to Nashik due to air connectivity with various cities like Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Indore, Ahmedabad, Goa, and Nagpur, said Bhalerao, who is also a senior member and past president of Travel Agents Association of Nashik (TAAN).Nashik is already famous for religious tourism due to Kalaram Temple, Godavari, and Trimbakeshwar Temple. But at the same time, it has also emerged as the wine capital of the country. Hence, those who come for religious tourism visit the different wineries in and around Nashik, added Bhalerao.Jagdish Holkar, president, All India Wine Producers Association (AIWPA), said, \\\"The footfall of tourists visiting prominent wineries in Nashik has already doubled in the last four-five days compared to the footfall around a week ago. The number of tourists will increase further in the next nine days till Jan 4,\\\" said Holkar.Apart from Sula Vineyards and Soma Wine, other wineries such as York, Vallonnie, Grover Zampa, Renaissance, Good Drops, etc are also attracting a good footfall of tourists. Sula Vineyards attracts around 60% of total footfall of tourists in wineries in Nashik. Sula has 104 rooms, including a 67-room resort in the winery.\\\"All the rooms in our resort is fully booked. The footfall of tourists also increased significantly in the last five days since Saturday,\\\" said Monit Dhavale, senior vice-president, Sula Vineyards.Pradeep Pachpatil, chairman of another major winery, Soma Wines, said that all the rooms in his 60-room resort are booked till Jan 3. The footfall of tourists to the winery also doubled in the last five days due to the festive season.Nagendra Sardeshpande, a medical practitioner from Mumbai, said that this is his third visit to Nashik winery in the last five years. \\\"I stay here for at least a couple of days whenever I come here. I also like to taste different types of wine,\\\" he said.Yogesh Patil, another tourist from Mumbai, said that he came to the city with his family members on Wednesday and will stay here for the next two days. \\\"Nashik is a beautiful city and the climate is also pleasant. Staying at the resort on the premises of a winery near the backwaters of Gangapur Dam has been a good experience for us,\\\" he said.",
