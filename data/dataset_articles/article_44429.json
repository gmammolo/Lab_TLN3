  "text": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — On the day after Christmas, the Miami Dolphins granted veteran edge rusher Shaquil Barrett his wish.\nThe Dolphins on Thursday, according to agent Drew Rosenhaus, are waiving Barrett, the 32-year-old defender who signed with the team in March, retired in July and wanted to return from retirement in November.\nThe Dolphins opted against activating Barrett from the reserve/retired list on Nov. 28, when he expressed his wishes to unretire. That made it so he wouldn’t be eligible to play for Miami for the rest of the season. They also at that time decided not to release him, which would’ve allowed him to play for another team.\nNow that the team did grant Barrett the opportunity to play elsewhere, he is first subject to waivers. But if a team claims him off waivers, he’s in the same boat he was in with the Dolphins.\nBarrett can sign with any team, likely a contender bound for the playoffs, if he clears waivers Friday.\nRosenhaus told ESPN, which first reported the latest news on Barrett, that his client is in great shape and ready to play immediately.\nInjury report\nDolphins wide receiver Jaylen Waddle returned to practice Thursday after injuring his knee Dec. 15 in Houston.\nWaddle had not practiced all last week before missing last Sunday’s win over the San Francisco 49ers. As the Dolphins didn’t practice on Christmas Day, Waddle was listed as a non-participation in an estimation of an injury report released Wednesday.\n “I’m expecting to get absolutely everything from Jaylen Waddle that he can do,” Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said Monday. “I’ve learned over time to not forecast with him, just his pain tolerance, his competitiveness. I’ve been talking to our head athletic trainer at length about making sure that we protect him from himself because he’s one of those guys that will try to will himself to performance.\n“We’ll see how the week progresses. I don’t really know exactly what it’ll look like at a couple positions, but at this point in the season, that’s old hat. You have a lot of people that are ready to contribute and you have to be able to adjust and we’ll take it day by day and see how it goes.”\nMissing from the Dolphins’ Thursday practice were left tackle Terron Armstead, cornerback Kendall Fuller and linebacker Anthony Walker Jr.\nWalker was added to the team’s injury report Wednesday with a knee injury.\nWhile safety Jordan Poyer was listed as a non-participant Wednesday with new knee and finger ailments, he was seen with the team during stretch.\nAlong with Waddle, fellow Miami wide receiver Dee Eskridge (knee) was practicing Thursday.\nWorth noting: Miami star wide receiver Tyreek Hill, according to wide receivers coach Wes Welker, has dealt with a hurt ankle this season. He is currently listed as receiving treatment on his ailing wrist.\n©2024 South Florida Sun-Sentinel. Visit sun-sentinel.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare",
