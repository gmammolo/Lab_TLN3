  "text": "3 hours ago Wine grapes on the vine. Image from cover of 2022 report by the San Diego County Vintners Association Residents and officials of Temecula will greet 2025 on Tuesday night with a salute to fruit, lowering a batch of grapes from the city’s clock tower to mark the final moments of the current year — on New York time — and welcome the New Year.\nThe annual “grape drop” celebration will begin at 6 p.m. in Town Square Park , which will undergo a temporary conversion to a Times Square-themed venue for celebrations on the last night of 2024.\nUnlike in previous years, this one will feature only one grape drop, coinciding with the traditional extravaganza in New York City.\nIn prior years, there were up to three drops, joining festivities on the East Coast, in the Midwest and finally West Coast. Toward the end of the 2010s, the drops were narrowed to two, celebrating the New York ball drop, and then the arrival of midnight in California.\nThere was no explanation for the celebration narrowing to one event.\nA large cluster of illuminated grapes, measuring 12-by-7 feet, will be gradually reeled down 65 feet from the third story of the Civic Center clock tower, marking the seconds before midnight eastern time, or 9 p.m. Pacific.\nThe countdown celebration will be open to the public outside Temecula City Hall and will feature live music by Bad Chemistry and Groove Squad , food vendors, and children’s activities, including a “giant slide.”\nA local “drone show” is planned just ahead of the Times Square celebration.\nCity officials are expected to stop by, and public safety personnel will be on hand. The party is slated to wrap at 10 p.m. Tuesday.\nAll of the grape drop celebrations, which began over a decade ago, have been in person except for the 2020-21 event, which was entirely virtual, broadcast via the city’s social media channels, because of the COVID lockdowns.\nTemecula Valley is home to dozens of vintners, and grapes are the staple product.",
