  "text": "Sometimes, less is more.\nJoel Embiid has seemingly carried the weight of the entire franchise on his back for the entirety of his NBA career. He’s won an MVP and led the Sixers to their best era of basketball since Allen Iverson was in town.\nAfter so many injuries and playoff disappointments though, something had to give. Embiid needed to change the way he played and what he did to prepare. We’ve already seen how seriously he’s taken issues with his surgically repaired knee. Though it’s been frustrating for everyone involved, the big man has listened to his body and the advice of the medical staff.\nOn the court, he knows he has two All-Star teammates in Tyrese Maxey and Paul George — plus a slew of reliable role players — to help him carry the load. Before the season started, Embiid frequently said his goal wasn’t individual accolades or to put the whole team on his back. His goal this season was to make things easier for his capable teammates.\nIn a huge Christmas Day win over the Celtics in Boston, Embiid did just that.\nIt was evident from the start of the game that Embiid, who was controversially ejected from Monday’s win over the San Antonio Spurs, had a little extra juice for this one.\n“He certainly brought some energy and some competitiveness to the game,” Nick Nurse told reporters postgame in Boston.\nOf course, what would a Joel Embiid game be without an injury scare?\nThis one happened pregame, with Embiid stepping on a security guard’s foot during warmups and tweaking his ankle. An awful setup in Boston nearly cost Embiid more time on the injury report, but we digress. Embiid was able to suit up and play — and looked mighty spry throughout the contest.\n“Just a little sore, but it’s Christmas,” Embiid told reporters. “Got to play on Christmas.”\nOver the course of his career, Al Horford has always played Embiid tough, but, as much credit as everyone gives the veteran big man, it’s the Celtics’ team defense that causes Embiid fits. Horford uses his strength and savvy to try to push Embiid away from his spots while the rest of Boston’s defense does so well playing on a string and taking away Embiid’s outlets.\nEarly in the game, it seemed like the strategy was for Embiid to use his gravity to get Maxey going. The two-man game between the duo has been unstoppable at times this year, typically leading to an open look for someone on the floor. Their chemistry helped Maxey put up 12 points and four assists in the opening frame.\nBefore it was cool to rip Victor Wembanyama for shooting too many threes and “not getting his butt on the block,” it was Embiid who heard that refrain. Embiid has never taken the volume of triples Wemby is currently taking, but the three-ball has been a regular part of his game. The reason: it opens up everything else.\nWith the way the Celtics were playing him, Embiid simply took what was there — which included making three threes in the first half and going 4-of-5 on the night. Without those makes, especially for a Sixers team that has been brutal from deep this season, who knows how this game would’ve turned out.\n“He had a good scoring night, shot the three-ball really well,” Nurse said. “That’s always going to be available for him, I think, especially when him and Tyrese are playing.”\nThere were instances throughout the game where Embiid looked great physically, likely the result of his knee feeling better and also all the weight he lost this offseason.\nLate in the first quarter, Paul George stripped Jayson Tatum, spurring a fast break. Maxey pushed the ball and Kelly Oubre, Jr. was ahead of the pack, occupying Jaylen Brown. That allowed Embiid, who busted it down the floor, to find a seam between Brown and Payton Pritchard for an under-control, nimble finish at the rim.\nbeep beep! big fella coming through!\n— Philadelphia 76ers (@sixers)[pic.twitter.com/8eNQvWeo0n][December 25, 2024]\nThe fact that Embiid was in the play at all after running the floor is a great sign. Oftentimes a play like this would end in Embiid either trying to plow over Brown and drawing an offensive foul or attempting to get fouled himself, leading to a funky turnover.\nHe had a couple other moments that should instill some optimism.\nWith the Celtics making a late push and the Sixers seemingly unable to run any type of offense, Nurse called a timeout with 2:25 left while clinging to a three-point lead. Out of the timeout, the Sixers went back to their bread-and-butter offense.\n“We finally got the ball across mid-court and ran a side screen-and-roll with Tyrese and Joel,” Nurse said, “and Joel rolled hard, and we hit him and he got fouled. That was kind of a stabilizing possession. It’s pretty dangerous when both guys can shoot the ball, and you’ve got size and quickness in that combination.”\nSuch a huge play for so many reasons:\n— Paul Hudrick (@PaulHudrick)\n-Sixers needed a stabilizing possession. Maxey-Embiid two-man game delivered\n-Embiid set a good screen, rolled(!) and got to the rim vs. Horford, drawing a foul. Set up a big Maxey layup later\n-Embiid came up gimpy but finished the game[pic.twitter.com/SG38G322OH][December 26, 2024]\nFor as physically imposing as Embiid is, he hasn’t always been the best screener. Much like he did during the Olympics for Steph Curry, Embiid consistently freed up Maxey with good, hard screens throughout the day. Embiid is typically not a roller either, generally preferring to pop to the elbow or the three-point line. It likely was just enough of a changeup for Horford that it caught him off balance.\nThat play also set up a critical basket that (almost) sealed the game.\nEmbiid found George for a corner three after the Sixers had the Celtics scrambling. Horford had to rush to the corner to contest George, leaving Brown to have to account for Embiid on the glass off the George miss. Embiid crashed hard, forcing Brown to yank him to the ground and foul him.\nThe following possession was clunky, with the Sixers nearly turning the ball over before it went out of bounds with 1.1 seconds left on the shot clock. Nurse called the perfect play at that moment, which led to a huge Maxey bucket.\nTYRESE MAXEY.\n— Philadelphia 76ers (@sixers)[pic.twitter.com/xekbPjFk2B][December 26, 2024]\nMaxey’s speed, along with Horford being unable to leave Embiid for the possibility of a quick three or roll to the basket, led to an open layup.\n“Really, what I was thinking was, ‘They’re not going to get off Joel’s body,’” Maxey said. “So he set a good screen, and I could curl it and have a chance to make a layup.”\nIt’s been a brutal season for Embiid.\nIn addition to his knee issue, he was suspended for shoving Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes, suffered a sinus fracture that’s forced him to wear a mask (again), and as mentioned was recently ejected after some ... spotty officiating.\nIt might not mean much to the outside world, but Embiid appeared to play with joy. He was fired up after the game, mobbing The Boston Strangler 2.0, Caleb Martin, who made a career-high seven threes. He busted Maxey’s chops while the guard was discussing his bounce back from a miserable Christmas Day game last season. He spoke glowingly about and expressed confidence in George, who had another dismal shooting night.\nThis was the type of game that can turn a season around — with a decent amount of luck.\n“I think we’ve got a high ceiling,” Embiid said. “It’s all about us pulling it together. I don’t think we played our best basketball, but Tyrese was great. I could’ve been better, PG could’ve been better, and we will be better. … Caleb gave us a good boost. The bench was great, but I don’t think that was our best basketball. But we’ve got a pretty good chance, so it’s all about waiting for some luck and staying healthy.”\nAnd continuing to trust his teammates to do more while he does a little less.",
