  "text": "Britney Spears Spends ‘Best Christmas of My Life’ with Her Sons\nReading Time: 2 minutes\nBritney Spears had a lot to celebrate this Christmas, as she apparently spent the holiday with her two sons, Jayden James and Sean Preston. Spears posted a video with Jayden on Instagram, calling it the “best Christmas of my life.”\nBritney Spears Spends Christmas with Her Sons\nOn Wednesday, Spears posted a video to Instagram in which she can be seen with her son Jayden, 18. “This is my baby,” she tells the camera before giving Jayden a kiss on the cheek. In another clip, they sit at a table by a fireplace, wishing everyone a merry Christmas.\n“Best Christmas of my life!!!” Spears wrote in the post’s caption. “I haven’t seen my boys in 2 years!!! Tears of joy and literally in shock everyday koo koo crazy so in love and blessed!!! I’m speechless thank you Jesus!!!”\nAlthough Spears mentioned her “boys” in the post, she didn’t share any photos or clips of her older son Preston, 19. However, The Daily Mail reports that he was also present with his mom for the Christmas festivities. A source said they surprised Spears for the holiday.\nSEE ALSO: BRITNEY SPEARS IS ‘MUCH HAPPIER’ AS SHE REUNITES WITH SON JAYDEN\nSpears Reunited with Jayden Earlier This Year\nChristmas was apparently not the first time Spears spent time with Jayden this year. TMZ reported in November that they had reunited in person, after Jayden and Preston reportedly wished Spears a happy Mother’s Day on the phone in May.\nA source recently shared that Spears “seems much happier than she was last year,” adding of her reunion with Jayden, “He’s open to mending the relationship with his mom and seeing where things go. Britney was very excited to hear from him; [it] means everything to her.”\nSpears had previously been estranged from her sons since 2022, when they chose not to attend her wedding to ex-husband Sam Asghari. They later moved to Hawaii with their father, Spears’ ex-husband Kevin Federline.",
