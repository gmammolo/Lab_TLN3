  "text": "The Tournament of Roses Parade is a time-honored tradition that rings in the new year with meticulously decorated floats, marching bands and equestrian units.\nThe annual floral spectacle will take shape on New Year’s Day with three groups from San Diego County marching down the streets of Pasadena in front of thousands of fans in person with millions more watching on television.\nREAD MORE: Rose Parade 2025 lineup: Your guide to every float, band and equestrian unit, in order\nHere is your guide to each float, band and equestrian unit with ties to San Diego.\nSan Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance The arrival of two giant pandas in 2025 marked a new chapter for the San Diego Zoo. Xin Bao and Yun Chuan, the first giant pandas to enter the United States in 21 years, will be honored with a float called “Friendship Across the Earth.”\nFrom delicate cherry blossoms to specially transported golden and black bamboo, the 55-foot float boasts more than 700,000 individual plants curated by San Diego Zoo horticulturists.\nA 25-foot ridgeline combines thousands of plants and flowers to create lush landscapes where the pair of floral pandas will sit and greet parade fans. The giant pandas won’t be the only beloved animals on display. Red pandas Lucas and Adira and Malayan tiger Connor will be replicated using thousands of flowers.\nThe San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance says more than 3,100 diverse plant species were used to create the float.\nU.S. Marine Corps West Coast Composite Band United States Marine Corps West Coast Composite Band (Courtesy Tournament of Roses) One of the many talented marching bands set to perform in the parade is the United States Marine Corps West Coast Composite Band. The military band, led by drum major Gunnery Sergeant Geoffrey A. Parks, includes U.S. Marines from the 1st Marine Division Band, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing Band and Marine Band San Diego.\nMembers of the band are professional musicians and fully combat trained with years of military experience.\nThe annual Rose Parade is the only event that brings the group of world-class musicians and service members together to perform at the same time.\n Scripps Miramar Ranch Members of the Scripps Miramar Ranch walk down Colorado Boulevard during the 135th Rose Parade in Pasadena on Monday, Jan. 1, 2024. (Photo by Libby Cline-Birmingham, Contributing Photographer) The group of world-renowned equestrians from Scripps Miramar Ranch will make another appearance on the parade’s five-and-a-half-mile route.\nThe team includes horses trained at the prestigious equestrian site in San Diego County. Marshal Michele Macfarlane will lead the team joined by television personality Carson Kressley and a team of professional equestrians.\nMacfarlane is a trailblazing world champion in the sport, earning multiple recognitions, including the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) Horse Person of the Year Award.\nHow to watch If you can’t make it to Pasadena, you can still celebrate the Rose Parade’s theme, “Best Day Ever,” from home. The 2025 Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade will be livestreamed and broadcast live on ABC, NBC, Univision and other networks starting at 8 a.m. PT on New Year’s Day.\nOriginally Published: December 26, 2024 at 2:30 PM PST",
