The best hand creams for dry skin treat a concern that’s hardly rare. “Dry, chapped hands are one of the most common issues that I see in clinic,” affirms Courtney Rubin, board-certified dermatologist and the cofounder of Fig.1.“For these patients, using a deeply moisturizing and occlusive hand cream that seals any breaks in the skin and acts as a protective barrier against moisture loss is critical.”\nWhile the best hand creams run the gamut from fancy and perfumed to biotech infused and all-natural, dermatologists warn that the best products for dry hands will stay within certain parameters. “By focusing on key aspects—ingredients, texture, and fragrance—you can choose the best hand cream for dry skin,” says Divya Shokeen, a board-certified dermatologist and hair-transplant surgeon based in Torrance, California. “Always remember that the best hand creams balance hydration, protection, and sensitivity to fragrance and other irritants.”\nVogue’s Favorite Hand Creams for Dry Skin:\n- Best Antiaging:\nRéVive Fermitif Hand Renewal, $90 - Best Water-Resistant:\nAvène Cicalfate Restorative Hand Cream, $27 - Best for Sensitive Skin:\nLa Roche-Posay Cicaplast Hand Cream, $12 - Best for Nail Care:\nSisley Paris Restorative Hand Cream, $120 - Best Overnight Treatment:\nSoft Services Theraplush Overnight Repair Treatment, $62 - Best for Eczema:\nSkinfix Eczema+ Hand Relief Cream, $25\nIn This Story\n- What do dermatologists recommend for extremely dry skin on hands?\n- What to Look for in a Hand Cream\n- Meet the Experts\nWhich creams achieve this balance? Ahead, eight board-certified dermatologists share their top creams for keeping skin soft and supple against eczema, harsh winter winds, and regular ol’ dishwashing duty.\nL’Occitane Dry Skin Hand Cream\n- Why We Love It: A Vogue editor favorite, this creamy salve contains 20% shea butter sourced from women-run cooperatives in West Africa. The ingredient is a powerful emollient; here, it’s paired with moisturizing sunflower seed and coconut oils for keeping skin smooth and supple. The cream is also infused with beta-glucan, a sugar-derived complex that helps soothe and nourish the skin, while rapeseed phytosterols (or plant-based lipids) help balance and protect it.\n- Key Ingredients: Shea butter, beta-glucan, rapeseed phytosterols\n- Fragrance: Yes\n- Size: 1 oz.\nCeraVe Therapeutic Hand Cream\n- Why We Love It: One of Dr. Rubin’s go-to recommendations is this, “a good option for a protective, hydrating, barrier-supportive, and occlusive hand treatment from a derm-favorite brand,” she says. Dr. Shokeen also recommends the drugstore pick for patients with dry hands as it’s infused with hyaluronic acid and ceramides to “strengthen the skin barrier.” What’s more, the cream has a stamp of approval from the National Eczema Association.\n- Key Ingredients: Niacinamide (for soothing and calming the skin), hyaluronic acid (for hydration), ceramides (to support the skin barrier)\n- Fragrance: No\n- Size: 3 oz.\nNécessaire the Hand Cream\n- Why We Love It:\nHoward Sobel, a board-certified dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon based in New York, says that Nécessaire’s cream restores elasticity to the skin on the hands while keeping it hydrated and plump. The cream is infused with ceramides for moisture, peptides for volume, and niacinamide to support the skin barrier. To take the hand-care-as-skin-care theme one step further, the brand recommends pairing it withthe Hand Retinol, which can be used at night. - Key Ingredients: Marula butter and oil, five ceramides, peptides, niacinamide\n- Fragrance: No\n- Size: 2.2 fl oz.\nAvène Cicalfate Restorative Hand Cream\n- Why We Love It: “This hydrating and nourishing cream helps to replenish moisture and boost the skin barrier,” says\nMarisa Garshick, a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York and New Jersey. “Plus, it’s been shown to last through five hand washings.” With an antibacterial copper-zinc complex and sucralfate—a wound-healing agent that supports skin repair—the cream is also infused with Avène’s thermal spring water (which Dr. Garshick explains “has been shown to soften, soothe, and calm the skin”). - Key Ingredients: Copper-zinc complex (an antibacterial ingredient), sucralfate (for soothing), Avène thermal spring water\n- Fragrance: No\n- Size: 3.3 fl oz.\nSoft Services Theraplush Overnight Repair Treatment\n- Why We Love It: “Soft Services Theraplush Overnight Repair Treatment uses 0.05% pure retinol in a satiny cream that smells like cake batter and left my hands gleaming through the morning,” Vogue.com editor Chloe Malle once wrote. (Though Malle detected a bakery-like scent, note that the product is technically fragrance-free.) Dr. Sobel adds, “With a combination of retinol and colloidal oatmeal, this helps lighten age spots while deeply hydrating the skin.” Also made with the humectant panthenol, the intensely moisturizing treatment should be used as the last step of a nighttime skin-care regime. As such, it comes with a pottery-like case meant for display on a bedside stand.\n- Key Ingredients: Retinol, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol\n- Fragrance: No\n- Size: 1.7 fl oz.\nRéVive Fermitif Hand Renewal Cream\nRéVive\nFermitif Hand Renewal Cream\n- Why We Love It: “Not only does this rose-scented hand cream work to hydrate the skin, but it also helps restore elasticity and firmness, improving the overall appearance of the skin on the hands,” says Dr. Garshick. The firming effects are linked to Révive’s Firming Hand Complex, made with a mix of collagen-and-elastin-stimulating peptides. As a bonus, the cream has SPF 15 for sun protection.\n- Key Ingredients: Bio-firming peptide, Firming Hand Complex (a mix of peptides and tea tree oil), mango seed, jojoba, and shea butters (for moisture)\n- Fragrance: Yes\n- Size: 3.4 oz.\nMedik8 H.E.O. Balm\n- Why We Love It: What’s the meaning behind H.E.O.? It’s simply an acronym for the balm’s ingredients, which work together to attract moisture and lock it into dry skin on the hands and face. “This moisture-boosting cream uses humectants, emollients, and occlusives, leaving the skin on the hand looking healthy and hydrated,” says Dr. Garshick. “Specifically, it harnesses allantoin to soothe the skin, beta-glucan to support the skin barrier, and arnica to calm the skin. It can also be great for post-procedure use or simply if the skin is feeling very dry.”\n- Key Ingredients: Allantoin (to soothe redness), beta-glucan (to support the skin barrier), and arnica (an anti-inflammatory)\n- Fragrance: No\n- Size: 1 oz.\nKiehl’s Ultimate Strength Hand Salve\nKiehl's\nUltimate Strength Hand Salve\n- Why We Love It: “This thick formulation is a great option for those with dry hands as it incorporates shea butter, avocado oil, and sesame-seed oil,” says Dr. Garshick. “It also helps to protect and repair the skin barrier, providing overall benefits for the skin.” A strong skin barrier protects the skin from irritants and pollution while balancing moisture levels and preventing water loss.\n- Key Ingredients: Shea butter, avocado oil, sesame seed oil\n- Fragrance: No\n- Size: 5.0 fl oz.\nEucerin Advanced Repair Cream\n- Why We Love It: Enriched with ceramides to support the skin barrier and alpha hydroxy for gentle exfoliation, Eucerin’s reparative cream can be used all over the body. It targets dryness with amino acids, which support hydration by facilitating the flow of moisture throughout the skin. The classic cream has a stamp of approval from Dr. Shokeen: “It’s rich in ceramides and restores moisture effectively.”\n- Key Ingredients: Ceramide-3 (to strengthen the skin’s moisture barrier), amino acids, alpha hydroxy (for exfoliation)\n- Fragrance: No\n- Size: 8 oz.\nAveeno Intense Moisture Skin Relief Hand Cream\n+t+inset-right\n- Why We Love It: With a rich consistency, “this oatmeal-based cream soothes and moisturizes deeply,” Dr. Shokeen says, adding that thick creams often work best for dry skin since the rich texture stays on the skin longer. In addition to oatmeal, the formulation contains glycerin, which “is ideal for drawing moisture into the skin,” Shokeen notes. Petrolatum helps seal it all in.\n- Key Ingredients: Glycerin, petrolatum, prebiotic oat\n- Fragrance: No\n- Size: 3.5 oz.\nLa Roche-Posay Cicaplast Hand Cream\nLa Roche-Posay\nCicaplast Hand Cream\n- Why We Love It: “This nongreasy hand cream has been shown to provide 48-hour hydration and is a great option for those with sensitive skin, as it is fragrance-free and paraben-free,” Dr. Garshick says. “It combines shea butter, glycerin, and niacinamide as well as thermal spring water”—an anti-inflammatory ingredient that tones and boosts hydration.\n- Key Ingredients: Niacinamide (to soothe and restore the skin), shea butter (an emollient), glycerin (a humectant)\n- Fragrance: No\n- Size: 1.69 fl oz.\nSkinfix Eczema+ Hand Relief Cream\n- Why We Love It: Designed to soothe eczema-prone skin, Skinfix’s salve is packed with ingredients that provide instant relief for itching and repair the skin barrier over time. “It has colloidal oatmeal and ceramide complex, plus extra hydration with glycerin, shea butter, and seed and vegetable oils,” says\nKseniya Kobets, director of cosmetic dermatology at Montefiore Einstein Advanced Care in Elmsford, New York. Thanks to the patented B-L3 Complex, the formulation is also infused with bio-mimetic peptides and lipids that support the skin barrier, helping the skin retain moisture while keeping it soft and smooth. - Key Ingredients: 5% colloidal oatmeal (to relieve itching), 3.75% patented B-L3 Complex (to repair the skin’s moisture barrier), 1% ceramide complex (to hydrate and protect the skin barrier)\n- Fragrance: No\n- Size: 3 fl oz.\nSisley Paris Restorative Hand Cream\nSisley Paris\nRestorative Hand Cream\n- Why We Love It: The cuticle-softening cream tends to the nails while keeping the hands soft and smooth. Angela Lamb, a board-certified dermatologist based in New York, previously spoke to Vogue about the efficacy of its ingredients. “This formulation contains chestnut extract with antioxidant properties to support intrinsic barrier function,” she said. “It’s also formulated with almond oil and vitamin B5, which can soften cuticles and promote nail strength.”\n- Key Ingredients: Biosaccharide solution and plant-based sugar (to attract and retain moisture), chestnut extract (to support the skin barrier)\n- Fragrance: No\n- Size: 2 fl oz.\nWhat do dermatologists recommend for extremely dry skin on hands?\n“For those with extremely dry skin, it is best to moisturize frequently, including after handwashing, to help retain moisture and nourish the skin,” Dr. Garshick instructs. “It is best to use a thick cream or ointment as this helps to lock moisture in and provides a protective barrier to minimize external irritation.” For example, Kiehl’s Ultimate Strength Hand Salve is a thick cream she often recommends.\n“For those with very dry skin, it can help to apply moisturizing cream and then wear cotton gloves to keep the area occluded and seal moisture in,” she adds.\nThose with ultradry hands should also modify their behavior around the house, Dr. Garshick suggests. “It is important to avoid prolonged exposure to water and to wear gloves when washing dishes,” she says. “When washing hands, it’s best to use lukewarm water and avoid hot water as this can dry out and irritate the skin.” Finally, it’s always wise to seek guidance from the pros. “If you experience itching or redness associated with the dryness, it’s important to see a board-certified dermatologist for further evaluation and management,” Dr. Garshick adds.\nWhat to Look for in a Hand Cream\n- Ingredients: To attract and retain moisture, “look for products that combine humectants like hyaluronic acid and glycerin with emollients like shea butter or oils,” says\nBrooke Jeffy, a board-certified dermatologist based in Scottsdale, Arizona. “The addition of ceramides and lipids helps to restore the skin barrier, which aids hydration as well.” - Texture: According to Dr. Garshick, “Those with dry skin should opt for a thicker cream or ointment as these work to lock moisture in and create a protective barrier on the skin to minimize further dryness and irritation.”\n- Fragrance: “While fragrance can make a hand cream more appealing, it can sometimes trigger irritation,” says Dr. Shokeen. “For extremely sensitive skin, it’s best to choose fragrance-free options. If fragrance is desired, ensure it’s derived from natural sources and is hypoallergenic to minimize potential irritation.”\nMeet the Experts\nhttps://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md, MD, FAAD, is a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York and New Jersey.Brooke Jeffy,MD, is a board-certified dermatologist based in Scottsdale, Arizona.Kseniya Kobets, MD, is the director of cosmetic dermatology at Montefiore Einstein Advanced Care in Elmsford, New York.Angela J.
