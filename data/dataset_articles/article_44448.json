  "text": "Ex-NFL Star DeSean Jackson to Take Head Coaching Job at HBCU Delaware State\nSeventeen years after leaving [California](https://www.si.com/college/college-football/team/california-golden-bears), longtime NFL wide receiver DeSean Jackson appears to be going back to school.\nJackson is finalizing a deal to become the head coach of Delaware State's football program, according to a Thursday afternoon report from Pete Thamel of ESPN. The 38-year-old played 15 years in the NFL, ending his career in 2023 after spending time with six different teams.\nThe Hornets—an HBCU program in the MEAC—have not had a winning season since 2012, and went 2–10 in 2024.\nJackson's hire is the latest in a trend of former NFL players taking HBCU jobs. [Colorado](https://www.si.com/college/college-football/team/colorado-buffaloes) coach Deion Sanders spent three years at Jackson State, Eddie George has led Tennessee State since 2021, and Michael Vick [was hired ](https://www.si.com/college-football/michael-vick-hired-norfolk-state-new-head-coach)as Norfolk State's coach on Friday.\nOver the course of his NFL career, Jackson reached three Pro Bowls and won a Super Bowl ring for his stint with the [Los Angeles Rams](https://www.si.com/nfl/team/los-angeles-rams) in 2021.\nDelaware State is scheduled to open its 2025 season on Aug. 28 against Delaware.",
