  "text": "Nearly a dozen AdventHealth hospitals have been recognized as Leapfrog Top Hospitals for 2024 , a distinction awarded to fewer than six percent of eligible hospitals in the United States. The awards highlight facilities that excel in patient safety, quality of care and transparency, based on rigorous evaluations by The Leapfrog Group , a national health care watchdog organization.\nAdventHealth hospitals were recognized in all four categories: Top General Hospitals, Top Teaching Hospitals, Top Rural Hospitals and Top Children’s Hospitals. Notably, one out of every six named as Top General Hospitals for 2024 are AdventHealth hospitals.\nRigorous standards for excellence\nThe Leapfrog Top Hospital Award is based on a comprehensive evaluation of safety and quality metrics.\nHospitals are measured on infection prevention, surgical safety, maternity care, ethical billing practices and more.\nThe data-driven approach allows The Leapfrog Group to identify hospitals that demonstrate consistent, exceptional care.\n\"It takes leadership, teamwork and absolute dedication to patients to achieve this award,” said Leapfrog Group President and CEO  Leah Binder .\nIn 2022, AdventHealth also received Leapfrog’s Emerald Award  for Outstanding Achievement by a Health Care System in recognition of its strong culture of safety and accountability -- the first and only health system to earn the distinction.\nA culture of caring for patients and team members\nAt AdventHealth, the culture of safety and quality is embedded within its service standards -- Love Me, Own It, Make It Easy, Keep Me Safe — which guide every interaction with patients, families and fellow team members.\n“Our team members are the heart of our safety and quality journey. Their dedication, compassion and commitment to excellence are what make achievements like the Leapfrog Top Hospital awards possible,” said William Scharf, MD, executive clinical director of quality and safety for AdventHealth. “When team members feel supported and valued, they are empowered to deliver the safest, highest quality whole-person care to our patients.”\nThe organization’s culture is symbolized by the “heart badge” worn by team members. “Our badge represents our promise to care for patients and each other like we care for our own loved ones,” said Dr. Scharf.\nFor a complete list of 2024 Leapfrog Top Hospitals, visit The Leapfrog Group’s website.\nRecent News 3 items.
