  "text": "A large group of freshmen led by Cayden Lancelin and Shadon Lee have the Westgate High boys basketball team on a hot streak.\nLancelin and Lee combined to score 43 points as the Tigers knocked off another young talented local squad, Lafayette Renaissance, in the opening round of the St. Thomas More Sunkist Shootout on Thursday.\nIt was the fourth win in five games since Dec. 20 for the Tigers, who erased a double-digit deficit for the 68-58 victory.\nWestgate (5-3) beat Iowa, which reached the 2023-24 Division II nonselect state tourney, on its home court last weekend, and blew out Division V select runner-up J.S. Clark by 17 points on Monday.\n\"We've had some really good wins,\" said Westgate oach Oliver Winston, whose team will face the St. Thomas More/Patterson winner at 6 p.m. Friday in the second round.\n\"It's really important when you're young like that, to get some success against a tough schedule. We've had a couple of games where we got blown out by teams with older guys.\"\nWestgate, which has lost to Lafayette High (9-0), Sulphur (11-2) and H.L. Bourgeois. fell behind LRCA 12-2 in the first quarter as coach Brad Boyd's Tigers made their first five field goals.\n\"It was a little bit of youth and me not doing a good job of making sure we're tuned in at the beginning of a game,\" Winston said of the slow start. \"I thought we did a good job once we started making some adjustments and turning up the tempo of the game.\"\nLRCA (7-3) was led by Matthew Gordon (17 points, 4 rebounds, 3 assists, three steals), Bubba Etienne (14 pts, 4 rebs, 3 steals) and Tavion Gallien (9 pts, four assists).\nThere were seven lead changes during the game, which was tied seven times. Antonio Quetel, one of 10 Westgate freshmen, put the Tigers ahead 53-52 with 5:15 remaining.\nQuetel (7 points, 5 rebs, 3 assists) added a jumper from the baseline a few seconds later after a steal by Lancelin, whose 3-pointer made it 59-56 with 2:13 to go.\n\"Cayden really kept us in the game in the first half offensively,\" Winston said of the freshman, who made 5 of his first 6 field goals and finished just shy of a triple-double with nine rebounds and eight steals (five assists). \"It's good to have a kid who can do that.\n\"In the second half, we had other guys step up and help him. Lee does a good job defensively. He's all over the ball, attacking the rim and making shots. He's an overall scorer.\"\nLee finished with five rebounds and four steals. Freshman forward Chance Archangel (7 pts, 8 rebs) and senior forward Peyton Knatt were able to stay in the game despite foul trouble. The two big-bodies were a force inside.\nArchangel, who picked up his fourth foul in the third quarter, asserted himself in the lane with two buckets in the closing minutes.\n\"I thought we did a good job of hustling, taking charges and getting steals,\" Winston said. \"Once we sped up the game, it's a little better style for us.\"\nFour players fouled out and another nine finished the game with either 3-or-4 fouls.\n\"We're carrying 14 players,\" Winston said. \"We're going to play 12. We'll play 14 if we have to. If you're sitting on the bench, you have to be able to play.\"",
