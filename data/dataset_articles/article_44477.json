  "text": "During the course of Dancing With The Stars Season 33, Gleb Savchenko and Brooks Nader caused quite a stir among fans. At first, viewers strongly believed the two were embroiled in the middle of a scandalous showmance. But as time went on, it seemed they sincerely seemed to care for each other.\nAfter some chaotic TikTok drama, Gleb and Brooks reunited for the DWTS Season 33 finale, where they performed alongside Jenn Tran and Sasha Farber .\nIn a new social media post, it seems like Brooks and Gleb have taken their relationship to the next level as they spent the Christmas holidays together.\nBrooks Nader & Gleb Savchenko Kept Their Love Alive Off The Dance Floor Dancing With The Stars viewers weren’t at all surprised to see Gleb and Brooks flirting on social media and onscreen. However, few thought their showmance would blossom into something greater.\nSeason 33 ended a month ago, but Brooks Nader and Gleb Savchenko are still spending quite a bit of time together.\nGleb Savchenko/Instagram Now, they’re even spending time with each other’s families. Gleb got a chance to know Brooks’ sisters during rehearsals for Dedication Night. But the Russian dancer decided it was time his new girlfriend met his daughters.\n“ I don’t need anything else ♾️” Gleb shared on Instagram . In the first photo, he poses with his oldest daughter, Olivia. But as the slides continue, Brooks Nader appears. In the fourth photo, Gleb snapped a picture of Brooks and Olivia strolling down the sidewalk together.\nIt’s not immediately clear when Gleb decided to introduce his new girlfriend to his children. However, Olivia and Brooks appear to be close already.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Gleb Savchenko (@glebsavchenkoofficial)\nDWTS Fans React To The Photo Dump Several Instagram users raised eyebrows at Gleb’s caption, noting his youngest daughter Zlata wasn’t present in the photos. More than likely, she was with her mother, Elena Samodanova . But even so, it seemed like an odd choice of words when both his children couldn’t be present.\nZlata’s absence aside, other fans thought the photos were incredibly sweet. At first, they found Gleb and Brooks’ romance incredibly shallow. But now, it seems like the couple is growing on DWTS fans.\nInstagram users wrote:\n“ The hard launch we’ve been waiting for 😍😍😍” “ I knew it was meant to be the moment you guys were partnered up… love you both so much 😭🫶🏼🤍 happy holidays” “ Finally, what we were waiting for…. it’s official!!!
