  "text": "Wheel Of Fortune is, at the end of the day, a game of chance. However, based on recent scenes, one player had luck on their side, and their hefty winning total even shocked host Ryan Seacrest. So, what happened in recent game show scenes, and how much did this player walk away with?\nWheel Of Fortune Is A Game Of Luck While Wheel Of Fortune players may be some of the best puzzle solvers around, an unlucky break can completely change the trajectory of someone’s game. As longtime fans have seen over the years, one bad wheel spin can completely kill someone’s momentum, especially if a player lands on the dreaded bankrupt spot on the wheel.\nIn addition to that, unlucky breaks when it comes to the letters players choose can also mean the difference between walking away with a huge payday or going home with nothing. As Wheel Of Fortune fans see on a regular basis, picking the wrong letters once you get to the big money puzzle at the end is enough to keep someone from solving the puzzle, right at the finish line to boot.\nWheel Of Fortune: Ryan Seacrest Recent Player Had Luck On Their Side In recent scenes, one Wheel Of Fortune player seemed to have all the luck in the world right in his back pocket. Thomas Russo from Scarsdale, New York, was a big winner on a recent episode of the game show. So much so that he even shocked host, Ryan Seacrest.\nFollowing a relatively slow start to his Wheel Of Fortune game, Russo quickly made up for lost time. He won several rounds, and even snagged a trip to the Caribbean in the process. Prior to advancing to the coveted Bonus Round, he had already pocketed more than $17k in cash winnings.\nWheel Of Fortune: Ryan Seacrest Wheel Of Fortune Player Brings It Home In The Bonus Round By the time Russo made it to the final Wheel Of Fortune round, he already built up considerable momentum going into it. Looking at the puzzle in front of him, he selected the letters “H, G, C, and I” to go with the usual “R, S, T, L, N, and E.”\nAll said and done, Thomas Russo was looking at a puzzle like this: “_ _ _ I N G / T H _ N G S / H _ _ _ E N.”\nLuckily for him, it did not take Thomas Russo very long to call out: “MAKING THINGS HAPPEN.”\nThe shock came a few moments later, when it was revealed that he would be adding an extra $40k to his winning total. All included, he walked away with an impressive $57,100.\nFor all the latest Wheel Of Fortune and other game show news, come back again to TV Shows Ace for more.",
