AND S\nAdvertisement\nBig Red Barn gets unanimous approval to host bigger events\nThe Monterey County Planning Commission unanimously approved a permit that would allow the popular Big Red Barn to host bigger events. Currently, the venue is used to host the flea market every Sunday. With the new permit, the venue hopes to attract events such as weddings, quinceañeras, electric carts, weddings, outdoor movies, paintball and more. The plan is to also increase parking for the area and increase the number of vendor spaces available.
