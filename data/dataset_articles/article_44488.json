  "text": "Liverpool 3-1 Leicester City: Salah scores 100th home Premier League goal in comeback win\nCody Gakpo, Curtis Jones and Mohamed Salah scored as Liverpool came from behind to beat Leicester City 3-1 on Boxing Day.\nLiverpool extended their lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points by fighting back to beat a spirited Leicester City 3-1 at Anfield.\nJordan Ayew opened the scoring after just six minutes as Leicester, who dropped into the relegation zone earlier on Boxing Day, threatened a monumental upset.\nHe swivelled on Stephy Mavididi's cross while holding off Andrew Robertson before squeezing his finish inside the near post, giving Leicester a timely boost after Wolves' win over Manchester United dropped them into the bottom three.\nRobertson and Mohamed Salah both struck the woodwork before Liverpool finally broke through with an outstanding strike from Cody Gakpo, and it was one-way traffic from then on.\nCurtis Jones put them 2-1 up early in the second half, sweeping Alexis Mac Allister's cross home from six yards out, before Salah made the points safe in the 82nd minute.\nThe Egyptian advanced into the area before tucking a neat finish inside the far post to score his 100th home Premier League goal, and his 16th overall in the competition this term.\nLiverpool's lead at the summit could be cut to six points when Arsenal host Ipswich Town on Friday, while Leicester are now 18th, one point behind Vitor Pereira's resurgent Wolves.\nData Debrief: Salah brings up big 250\nMaking his 250th Premier League start for Liverpool, Salah registered his 250th goal involvement for the Reds in the competition.\nHe is just the fourth player to achieve that feat for a single club, after Wayne Rooney for Manchester United (276), Ryan Giggs for the same side (271) and Harry Kane for Tottenham (259).\nSalah also has 100 home Premier League goals, with 98 of those coming for Liverpool and two for Chelsea.\nHe is just the eighth player to reach that milestone and has done so in the fourth-fewest games, after Alan Shearer (91 appearances), Thierry Henry (113) and Sergio Aguero (125).",
