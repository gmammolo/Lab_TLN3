  "text": "By Michael Katz | Thursday, 26 December 2024 04:36 PM EST\nGiven that Thursday marked the feast of St. Stephen, recognizing the first martyr of Christianity, Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, told Newsmax the message for this time of year is about something deeper than God showing us love.\n\"Saint Stephen's martyrdom leads us deeper — something that both Jews and Christians acknowledge,\" Pavone told \"American Agenda.\" \"We are to love the Lord, our God, with all our heart, mind, soul, and strength.\"\n\"So, Jesus takes on a body and blood so that he can offer it on the cross. Greater love than this no one has, than to lay down his life for his friends and for his God [John 15:13]. This is what we see — not only God loving us, but Christmas shows us the power that He gives us to love Him, even if it means the sacrificing of our lives.\"\nPavone said it is what the celebration of the martyrs, as well as the celebration of love, is about throughout the year.\n\"And love, when you think about it, is at the center of every calling,\" he said. \"Spouses to love one another, parents to love their children — born and unborn — clergy to love their congregation. All of us, whether married or single or in the religious life or any vocation and every vocation, is one of self-giving love.\"\n\"That's the whole message that both Christmas and the Christian gospel are meant to convey and to empower us to live.\"\nAbout NEWSMAX TV:\nNEWSMAX is the fastest-growing cable news channel in America!\nMichael Katz is a Newsmax reporter with more than 30 years of experience reporting and editing on news, culture, and politics.\n© 2024 Newsmax.
