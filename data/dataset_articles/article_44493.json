  "text": "Every week, Washington Commanders rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels seems to make history. On Sunday, Daniels and the Commanders will host the Atlanta Falcons, and he will make more history.\nAccording to NBC Sports, Sunday night’s game between the Commanders and Atlanta Falcons will be the first time in NFL history that two first-round rookie quarterbacks will start in a prime-time game.\nMichael Penix Jr. will make his second career start vs. Washington after replacing Kirk Cousins last week. Penix was the No. 8 overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft, while Daniels was the No. 2 overall pick.\nIt’ll be an NFL first on Sunday Night Football when Michael Penix Jr. and Jayden Daniels take the field. pic.twitter.com/BUJV9wg1tq\n— Sunday Night Football on NBC (@SNFonNBC) December 26, 2024\nPenix completed 18 of 27 passes for 202 yards in his first NFL start with an interception. The Falcons defeated the New York Giants 34-7.\nMeanwhile, Daniels is coming off a performance in which he passed for five touchdowns, including the game-winner with six seconds remaining, to lead Washington to an upset win over the Philadelphia Eagles. Daniels was named FedEx Air Player of the Week for the third time and the P epsi Zero Sugar Rookie of the Week for a record 10th time this week .\nEarlier this week, Daniels spoke of his appreciation for Penix as a person and player.\nSunday’s game features playoff implications for the Commanders and Falcons. Atlanta (8-7) currently leads the NFC South, while Washington (10-5) can clinch a playoff berth before the game even starts .",
