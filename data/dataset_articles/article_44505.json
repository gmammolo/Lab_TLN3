  "text": "The state Economic Development Authority has granted Explore Siouxland a $ 10,000 tourism grant. The funding is intended to support the Wheel the World project, which aims to make attractions more accessible for travelers with access needs.\nSpokesperson Kristen Heimgartner shares about the Wheel the World project and the support for Explore Siouxland: \"We pick a couple of restaurants, hotels, and attractions that we think would be a good fit.\" Then, people with mobility issues are asked to take a survey in order to help the project leads assess how accessible the hospitality establishments and attractions really are. The feedback is taken into consideration and the businesses, alongside Explore Siouxland, take proactive steps to address the issues associated with access.\nIn this initial round, ten businesses are taking part in the Wheel the World initiative.\nImage Credit: Explore Siouxland\nExplore Siouxland Receives a Grant to Bolster Accessibility\nReferences:\nwheeltheworld&radioiowaTrend Themes\n1.
