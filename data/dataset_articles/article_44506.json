  "text": "The Airey Group and Andrea McLean Studio are local design firms that have joined forces to create the Big Sky Beach House. It is a light and urban home by the beach defined by details including its open roof decks and the folding screened facade. Nestled in Vancouver, the home rests on a narrow lot and opens up views with the folding screen facades to enjoy its surroundings.\nThe interior architect and founder of her studio, Andrea McLean shares with Dezeen, \"Conceptual images that were gathered by the clients included many Australian projects, all that felt comfortable, natural and forgiving. Ultimately, the goal for this small house was to create a sense of space that was open and airy, yet connected to the ground and making the most of a close proximity to the beach and ocean air.\"\nImage Credit: Ema Peter\nThe Airey Group and Andrea McLean Design the Big Sky Beach House\n[Amy Duong](/amyduong)— December 26, 2024 —\n[Art & Design](/artdesign)\nReferences:\nandreamclean&dezeenTrend Themes\n1.
