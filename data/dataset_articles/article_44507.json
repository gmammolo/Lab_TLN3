  "text": "Completing a well-rounded education is difficult enough as a young adult, let alone doing so later in life. Nonetheless, Glendive resident Robert Worthington, 57, is yet another step closer to fulfilling his lifelong dream of becoming an attorney.\nWorthington officially kicked off his journey to the legal sector in 2022 when he graduated with an associate's degree from Eastern Gateway Community College's Paralegal Program.\nAlthough getting started later than most legal pupils, the profession is not entirely absent from Worthington's life.\nHe explained his late uncle was a judge in Germany for more than 20 years and helped teach the eastern part of the European country western German law after the Berlin Wall came down. His German cousin, the son of his uncle who sat as a judge, also currently serves in the country as an attorney.\nVisiting them every two years growing up, it was Worthington's uncle who planted the idea that he may one day have what it takes to work as an attorney.\n\"My uncle is the one who saw the potential of me being in law when I was just 13,\" Worthington said, adding he recalls spouting legalese and pounding his uncle's gavel as if he were Perry Mason from the hit TV drama.\nAfter 15 years of military service and several more years living and working in Glendive, Worthington ultimately decided he would make good on the promise he made to his uncle; to look into and go through law school.\n\"I decided it was time I did something for myself,\" Worthington said. \"When I got through (the paralegal program), it ignited a fire of this is what I've got to do.\"\nSince graduating the paralegal program at EGCC in 2022, Worthington also obtained a second associate's degree in criminal justice before graduating with a bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice from Youngstown State University earlier this month. More than that, he was able to complete the four-year degree in just two semesters due to previously having more than 220 credit hours.\nWorthington is currently working with the Law School Admission Council in taking the LSA Test and applying to at least five different law schools. He will take the LSAT in April of 2025 and hopes to be enrolled and starting law school by the fall next year.\nAt this time, Worthington is most interesting in focusing his practice in family and Native American law, but realizes that could change in the future once he is in the middle of law school.\nHe added his sights are mainly on family law due to some personal experience as well as observing the effects different cases involving families can have on each individual person involved.\nNonetheless, he believes he could be an asset to Glendive by adding another attorney to the few practicing in eastern Montana.\n\"I think Glendive needs lawyers,\" Worthington said.\nUnderstanding his feat to become an attorney later in life is a bit abnormal in society, Worthington knows it is not impossible. He noted some people even start the long journey as late as 65 years old.\nNo matter when he gets it done, he is determined to see the process through and make a reality of what was once just a pipe dream.\n\"It's more about fulfilling a dream and then putting that dream into action,\" Worthington said.\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters Brendan Heidner can be reached at bheidner@rangerreview.com\n(0 Ratings)",
