  "text": "Good Old Games is back with another epic holiday sale, and this year it features over 6,500 deals. Though its work preserving the history of gaming via its Preservation Program is its greatest feat, there’s a lot to love about these discounts, too. While Santa readies his reindeer and Frosty dons his magical hat, there’s no better time to dive into some seasonal deals. The Nerd Stash has tracked down some of the greatest games getting the biggest cuts, and there’s more to choose from this year than ever before. Here are 10 of the best deals of the GOG winter sale, in no particular order.\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2\nBetween Space Marine 2, Boltgun, and Total War: Warhammer 3, there’s arguably never been a better time to be a fan of 40k and classic Warhammer. Saber Interactive’s third-person co-op shooter delivers gore and desperate firefights on the grandest scale. This 75% discount means it’s cheaper than ever to wade into the Tyranid trenches and show those bugs what the Emperor’s wrath looks like. It’s time to shine the light of violence through that grimdark veil.\nDisco Elysium\nBetween the Thought Cabinet, Revachol, and Kim, it’s hard to know what to praise first. ZA/UM’s eccentric CRPG is nothing short of genius. By literally giving voice (and identities) to your character’s thoughts and personality traits, Disco Elysium makes you feel like you’re solving the mystery of yourself. Of course, you’re supposed to be solving a murder mystery, but Hobocop didn’t get this far by making good decisions. You can now experience the pinnacle of the genre for 75% off.\nDivinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition\nBefore Larian Studios rocketed to fame and glory with its beloved D&D adaptation Baldur’s Gate 3, the studio created one of the best new fantasy IPs of the last decade. Iconic characters like the sorcerous skeleton Fane bring the studio’s meticulous plot and dialogue to life, but it’s the deep customization and sandbox problem-solving that make the game so good. If you’ve never played Original Sin 2 and want to scratch that Astarion itch, this 70% discount is as good an excuse as any.\nMetro Franchise Bundle\nOkay, it’s a bundle, not a single game, but you can’t argue with getting this level of quality for 84% off. In it you get 2033, Last Light, Exodus, and both Exodus DLCS (Two Colonels and Sam’s Story), letting you experience the entire frostbitten saga. The claustrophobic tunnels of Last Light and 2033 give gritty FPS fans plenty of reasons to dive in, but it’s the open zones of Exodus that deliver peak immersion. Nothing says “bad time” like a cracked gas mask.\nFrostpunk: GOTY Edition\nFrostpunk feels like a test of your moral flexibility as much as your resource management skills. Tasked with keeping an isolated community alive in a frozen, post-apocalyptic wasteland is no easy task. Of course, it would be a bit easier if you were willing to put children to work mining coal. Someone has to keep the heat stacks running, after all. At 78% off, getting Frostpunk: GOTY Edition is one of the best deals of the GOG winter sale. It’s also the perfect way to warm up your skills before the sequel.\nCyberpunk 2077\nFew devs have a better redemption arc than CD Projekt Red. Forget Cyberpunk 2077‘s rocky launch. Gone are the glitch montages and crashes. In their place is one of the best and boldest open-world FPS games in existence. Night City is a sci-fi crime playground whether you want to hack, shoot, or slice your problems up with a katana. Even without the exceptional Phantom Liberty, there’s almost endless entertainment to be found here. A 55% discount is the perfect reason to lock, load, and show Arasaka what V’s made of.\nDeus Ex: Mankind Divided\nA divisive follow-up to the original Deus Ex, Mankind Divided is still one of the most interesting immersive sims around. Jensen’s arsenal of weapons and augments gives you a ton of control over your approach to objectives, and the solid gunplay means even spoiled plans can have satisfying ends.\nMankind Divided‘s level design also encourages exploration and innovation, giving the game replayability to rival the year’s best games. There’s no problem that careful planning and plentiful guns can’t solve. Now they can do it at 85% off.\nDragon Age: Origins Ultimate Edition\nIf Veilguard piqued your curiosity regarding BioWare’s storied fantasy franchise, let this 75% discount be the nudge you need. While the combat in Origins isn’t as flashy, the game’s story arguably sets the bar for emotional depth. Many RPGs promise that they’ll make your choices matter, but Origins is the rare game that delivers. Customize your party, wield deadly magic, and do the right thing (or just romance Morrigan). Ultimate Edition includes the Awakening expansion and all nine Content Packs, making it one of GOG’s best deals at this price.\nKingdom Come: Deliverance Royal Edition\nWith or without mods, Henry is a simple lad. He likes practicing his reading skills, making friends, and narrowly avoiding getting gutted by rogue knights. Okay, maybe he enjoys the latter a bit less. Life in the Middle Ages was often tedious and cruel. Warhorse Studios’s award-winning ARPG is just as cruel but far more fun. Though it’s a great deal grittier than most RPGs (illiteracy being as great a foe as bandits), the lows of Kingdom Come: Deliverance only make its highs that much higher. At 80% off, that’s an easy pick.\nYakuza Complete Series\nYakuza 0, Kiwami, Kiwami 2, 3 Remastered, 4 Remastered, 5 Remastered, and The Song of Life are a steal at almost any price. 60% off that bundle is robbery of a scale even Kazuma Kiryu would struggle to thwart. Infinite Wealth might be the franchise’s biggest entry, but it has tough competition for the honor of being the best. There’s a soap opera-worthy plot, beat-’em-up combat, and hundreds of hours of side content. For both scope and quality, the Yakuza complete series bundle ranks amongst the best of the GOG winter sale.",
