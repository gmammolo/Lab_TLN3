The event is named for Key West’s geographical location at the beginning of U.S. Highway 1, which is marked with a green “MILE 0” sign.\nAttendees can enjoy five nights of main stage shows at Key West’s Coffee Butler Amphitheater, located at 21 Quay Road, beside Truman Waterfront Park. Intimate acoustic jams and songwriter swaps at other island locations are to complement the main-stage action.\nThe musical lineup features groups and bands ranging from emerging artists to critically acclaimed Americana and “Red Dirt” stars. As well as the genre standouts already listed, performers include Stoney LaRue, Wade Bowen, 49 Winchester, Django Walker, Bri Bagwell, Adam Hood, Taylor Hunnicutt and other notables.\nNow in its eighth year, Mile 0 Fest has become a popular musical gathering acclaimed for its laid-back Key West atmosphere, balmy subtropical weather and the opportunity for up-close interaction with featured performers.\nWhile enjoying the onstage shows, audience members can purchase offerings from local food trucks, mobile bars and other vendors. As well as the musical experience, they can choose to participate in Key West activities ranging from a fishing derby to offbeat “Tipsy Tikis” cocktail cruises.\nAmong festival admission options are five-day packages that include accommodations, entrance to all event venues, private VIP parties, a live-music sailing excursion and more. Multi-day and single-day passes without accommodations, each allowing entrance to all event venues, also are available.\nFestival information and ticketing: [mile0fest.com](http://www.mile0fest.com)\nAttendees can enjoy five nights of main stage shows at Key West’s Coffee Butler Amphitheater as well as intimate acoustic jams and songwriter swaps at other island locations: Photos courtesy Mile 0 Fest.\nMile 0 Fest has become a popular musical gathering acclaimed for its laid-back Key West atmosphere, balmy subtropical weather and the opportunity for up-close interaction with featured performers.",
