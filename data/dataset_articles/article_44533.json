  "text": "As Operation Safe Arrival continues across Tasmania, police and road safety advocates are urging young drivers to keep themselves safe these holidays.\nAssistant Commissioner Adrian Bodnar said young drivers are at a higher risk of being involved in crashes.\n\"Studies show that the first six to 12 months on P-plates sees one of the highest spikes of crash rates throughout a driver's life.\"\n\"It's crucial for all drivers to obey road rules, but it's even more important for younger drivers with less experience.\"\n\"We want young drivers to understand that our enforcement is about protecting them and others on the road.\"\nRACT Head of Advocacy Mel Percival said keeping young Tasmanians safe on the road is one of RACT's top priorities.\n\"We know that young people are sadly over-represented when it comes to deaths and serious injuries on our roads,\" she said.\n\"That's why we launched the More than a Statistic campaign earlier this year, to draw attention to the tragic impact of road trauma on young Tasmanians.\"\n\"Many young Tasmanians are on the road this summer for the first time and there are a few areas where younger drivers are especially vulnerable.\"\n\"It is a great opportunity for friends and family to be involved in planning journeys, including rest stops, allowing enough travel time and being aware of the fatal five: speed, distraction, fatigue, drug or drink driving and not wearing a seatbelt.\"\nAssistant Commissioner Bodnar said Operation Safe Arrival would continue across the state.\n\"With more drivers of all ages on our roads this festive season, our police will be looking out for everyone across Tasmania in a bid make sure everyone reaches their destinations safely.\"\n\"While Christmas has come and gone, we know people will be out and about celebrating the New Year and enjoying other events across the state.\"\n\"My message to all drivers, and especially those who are new to driving, is to please make good decisions.\"\n\"Don't drive if you've been drinking or taking drugs, stay under the speed limit, leave your phone alone, wear your seatbelts and take the time to rest rather than trying to drive if you're fatigued.\"\n\"If we all make an effort to do these simple things, we can make our roads safer for everyone.\"\n[here](https://www.miragenews.com/young-drivers-urged-stay-safe-on-roads-this-1384810/).",
