  "text": "Premier League: Liverpool 3 (Gakpo 45, Jones 49, Salah 82) Leicester City 1 (Ayew 6) Liverpool have kicked off at 8pm on a St Stephen’s Day twice in their history. The first time was in 2019, when Jürgen Klopp’s team demolished Leicester en route to winning the Premier League title with ease. The second time ended with another convincing defeat of the Foxes. That may not be the only repeat.\nArne Slot’s soaring leaders moved seven points clear of their closest challengers for the title, with a game in hand, courtesy of a controlled comeback against Ruud van Nistelrooy’s side. Leicester took a shock early lead through Jordan Ayew and, while Liverpool never hit the heights of their 2019 performance at the King Power Stadium, goals from Cody Gakpo, Curtis Jones and Mohamed Salah’s 19th of the season ensured the outcome remained the same.\nAnfield was shrouded in fog for the night-time kickoff but, for Liverpool, there was an opportunity to put daylight between themselves and Chelsea following a perfect set of results elsewhere.\nThe league leaders’ prospects appeared healthy against a Leicester team that had been soundly beaten in their previous two fixtures and had a Premier League debutant in goal. Jakub Stolarczyk replaced Danny Ward as a result of the merciless barracking the Wales goalkeeper received from his own supporters in Leicester’s 3-0 defeat by Wolves on Sunday.\nREAD MORE Mikel Arteta hoping Gabriel Martinelli can help fill void following Saka’s injury",
