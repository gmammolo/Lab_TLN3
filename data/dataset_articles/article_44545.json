All you need to get started is a baking sheet, skillet and wooden spoon or spatula.\nThis recipe will make 8 servings, perfect for sharing! Of course, if you have a large crowd you can always double the recipe!\n- Make the tater tots. To begin, toss the 28 ounces of frozen tater tots with 2½ teaspoons of taco seasoning then prepare them as directed on the package. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat.\n- Cook the meat. Next, add 1 pound of ground beef taco meat to the pan and cook until no pink remains. Use a spatula to break it up as you go.\n- Combine ingredients. Once the tater tots are done, remove them from the oven and add the cooked ground beef taco meat, 15 ounces of black beans, ¾ cup of shredded cheese, 1½ cups of nacho cheese sauce, and 15.25 ounces of sweet corn. Return the tots to the oven to bake at 350°F(175°C)for 10 minutes.\n- Remove and add toppings. Remove the totchos and add on 1 cup of tomatoes, the remaining ¾ cup of shredded cheese, and any additional toppings you want. Serve immediately.\nThese yummy totchos would be a great, hearty side dish for a Travis Scott burger or Wagyu burger. Of course, they would be completely delicious by themselves as well! Enjoy!\n💭 Tips & Notes\n- To make these totchos vegan simply omit the shredded cheese and ground beef and use vegan nacho cheese instead of the nacho cheese sauce!\n- While typical nachos are an easy-going finger food, these totchos definitely require using a fork!\n- I recommend using my ground beef taco meat for the most flavorful experience! However, any ground beef would work as well.\n- To store: Totchos are best eaten fresh, but if you happen to have leftovers, you can store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.\n- To reheat: Bake your totchos in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until heated thoroughly.\n❓ How Do I Get The Crispiest Tater Tots?\nOne trick to get extra crispy tots is to cook them in the oven for about 5 minutes longer than the packaging directs. Another trick is to roll the tater tots in bacon grease before cooking (flipping them halfway through cooking).\nAdditionally, you could utilize your air fryer to make the tater tots perfectly crisp! Make sure to let it fully preheat before adding in your tots. You can follow your packaged instructions or cook for 15-20 minutes at 400°F (205°C).\n❓ What Do You Eat With Totchos?\nTotchos make a great standalone dish! Of course, you could serve it alongside some burgers or sandwiches. It would also be fantastic on an appetizer table alongside some grape jelly meatballs or chicken wings!\n❓ What Are Totchos Made Of?\nTotchos are incredibly customizable, so the toppings truly depend on what you love! The tater tot base and nacho cheese sauce are what make these tater tot nachos, everything else is up to you!\nSome great topping recommendations are black beans, avocado, shredded cheese, tomato, shredded lettuce, bacon, black olives, sour cream, salsa, onion, pico de gallo, and jalapenos!\n🏈 More Game Day Appetizers!\n- Mozzarella Sticks\n- Baked Mac N Cheese Bites\n- Stuffed Pizza Bombs\n- Sausage Cream Cheese Balls\n- Rotel Dip\n- Pinwheel Sandwiches\nDo you love a recipe you tried?
