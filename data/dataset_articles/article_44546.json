  "text": "(Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)\nThe Atlanta Falcons have been the talk of the town in the NFL when it comes to the quarterback position this season.\nThey signed veteran Kirk Cousins to a major four-year deal this offseason before drafting rookie Michael Penix Jr. out of Washington in the first round of the NFL Draft.\nNow, Penix has replaced Cousins as the team’s starter with just a couple of weeks to go in the regular season.\nAccording to insider Aaron Wilson, the franchise has recently made another move at the position: They have signed Emory Jones to the practice squad.\n#Falcons signing quarterback Emory Jones to their practice squad, per a league source @KPRC2 #NFL\n— Aaron Wilson (@AaronWilson_NFL) December 26, 2024\nRaheem Morris’s team is currently sitting in first place in the NFC South at 8-7, as they also own the tiebreaker over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nThat is why there has been immediate pressure on Penix to produce.\nIn his first start last week against the New York Giants, he completed 18 of 27 passes for 202 yards and an interception.\nThe team won, but the former All-American will have to perform better this weekend in a Sunday Night Football matchup against the Washington Commanders.\nIf he struggles, the team might have to return to Cousins, which would be awkward in both the locker room and the quarterback room.\nRegarding young Emory Jones, the former Florida Gator is on his second NFL team after spending time with the Ravens last season and the DC Defenders of the UFL.\nIt will be interesting to see how long he stays on the practice squad.",
