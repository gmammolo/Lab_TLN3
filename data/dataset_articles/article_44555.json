  "text": "Longshot J B Strikes Back (Goldencents) upset the inaugural running of the GII Laffit Pincay, Jr. Stakes (previously run as the San Antonio Stakes) Thursday in his first try facing stakes company for trainer Doug O'Neill.\nThe 3-year-old gelding, understandably one of the least experienced runners in the field and the second longest wagering price, broke his maiden in his third start in a $20,000 claimer at Del Mar and was claimed out of that start from these same connections who promptly bought him right back in a $25,000 conditioned claimer when he was sixth in his very next start. Off the board in his next two tries over both dirt and turf, J B Strikes Back jumped up to put up a big number in an optional claimer going one mile at Del Mar Nov. 3 and responded with yet another win facing similar company at the same distance Nov. 23.\nGuided from an inside draw with Antonio Fresu taking over from Juan Hernandez, J B Strikes Back was briefly outrun as the field passed the wire for the first time but quickly got himself into stride to contend for the lead outside of Ashcroft ( Munnings ) around the first turn and into the backstretch. Still two wide and joined by Tarantino (Pioneerof the Nile) to his outside nearing the half-mile pole, J B Strikes Back took advantage of Ashcroft fading along the rail to shoot ahead and turned for home with both Tarantino and Express Train ( Union Rags ) looming. But with a safe margin built up, the 16-1 chance turned the tables on the older horses and came home clear with only 20-1 shot American Admiral ( American Pharoah ) making up ground on him late and just missing for the placing.\n“It's such an honor to win this race,” said O'Neil. “My mom Dixie was really good friends with Laffit Pincay Jr.'s mom and we are really good friends with his brother Alonso, so the Pincay family really means a lot to us. He still looks like he can still ride today, it's amazing and a huge honor. Janie Buss and the whole Buss family they are so generous. She donates all of the earnings of any of her beautiful horses that make any money to different causes. This is really to her because she wanted to take a chance after his last couple of efforts. We took a chance, and it worked out perfect.”\nFresu added: “My trip was great, amazing it was what we had planned. What about this training performance by Doug (O'Neill)? This horse he kept improving and now he is in graded stakes, that was amazing. I feel very excited to see where he goes next. Today, what I was thinking was if the track was fast, to get a nice trip out in front, or be pretty close. I thought the horse had a good chance. He proved to us his ability.”\nPedigree Notes :\nJ B Strikes Back is now the second graded stakes winner under stakes-winning first dam Allanah, joining his talented older half-brother Reincarnate ( Good Magic ) who took the GIII Sham Stakes and also placed in the GI Arkansas Derby, the GI FanDuel Racing Pacific Classic Stakes and the GI Santa Anita Handicap. Allanah, who last went under the hammer for $105,000 at Keeneland November in 2018, is a half to MGSP Over Emphasize (Overanalyze) and this is the family of two-time Peruvian champion grass horse Zeide Isaac (Freud). J B Strikes Back, the eighth graded stakes winner for Goldencents, has an un-raced 2-year-old half-brother by Liam's Map and a weanling half-sister by Good Magic while Allanah went to Life Is Good for 2025.\nJ B STRIKES BACK ($34.80) struck back big in the $200,000 Laffit Pincay Jr. Stakes (G2) at @santaanitapark .
