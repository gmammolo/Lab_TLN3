  "text": "Trying nine furlongs for just the second time in his career and looking to protect a perfect mark over the Santa Anita turf course, Cuyathy LLC's Johannes ( Nyquist ) was given a supremely confident steer by Umberto Rispoli and was really only asked to finish up to post a soft victory in Thursday's GII San Gabriel Stakes.\nCrunched into long odds-on favoritism to improve on his hard-nosed runner-up effort behind More Than Looks (More Than Ready) in the GI Breeders' Cup Mile down at Del Mar on Nov. 2, the homebred raced in close attendance to whatever pace was on as Cabo Spirit (Pioneerof the Nile) ambled them along through the early exchanges beneath Frankie Dettori. Johannes enjoyed the run of the race from just in behind, but was hemmed in along the rail for the trip around the second turn and was held together by a very patient Rispoli nearing the stretch.\nEased out into the four-wide line, Johannes came with his typically strong finish to easily account for last-out GII Seabiscuit Handicap hero Mi Hermano Ramon (Creative Cause), fortifying his bid for an Eclipse Award next month. Seal Team (GB) ( War Front ), three wide the majority of the trip, held for third.\nJohannes is likely to make his next appearance in the GI Pegasus World Cup Turf at Gulfstream Park on Jan. 25.\n“We originally thought about giving the horse a breather,” said winning trainer Tim Yakteen. “He had such a strong campaign and he came out of the Breeders' Cup so well. Everything was near perfect in his last outing, so we came to the San Gabriel and now we will head to the Pegasus. In my heart, he is a true champion. I hope others view it that way.”\nAdded Rispoli, “You know, with a horse like him, it's not possible to panic. You press the button and in three strides, you're right up there. You just have to manage how to get the wire because once you get the lead, you try to wait for other horses. But, you know, you never panic with him. Once you see the daylight, he goes. It doesn't matter.”\nWinner of three of his first four starts on the grass, Johannes returned from an 11-month absence to take out this track's GIII American Stakes going a mile Apr. 4 before breaking through for a maiden Grade I in the May 27 Shoemaker Mile Stakes. The dark bay tried this distance for the first time in the GII Eddie Read Stakes July 28, easily defeating Dicey Mo Chara (GB) (Adaay {Ire}), and was a comfortable winner of the local GII City of Hope Mile Stakes Sept. 28. The 22-5 second choice in the Mile, he came with a run from midpack to loom a threat in the final furlong, only to be outfinished by a flying More Than Looks.\nPedigree Notes:\nIn the name of their Cuyathy , Joe and Debby McCloskey purchased Johannes's dam for $50,000 at the 2014 Keeneland November Sale and raced her to three wins from 20 tries and a third placing in the Kalookan Queen Stakes in 2018. Johannes is the first foal from the mare, who is also responsible for Sea Dancer, recent winner of the Carousel Stakes at Laurel Park, and the juvenile filly Sea Runner ( Gun Runner ), third in the Del Mar Juvenile Fillies Turf at Del Mar Sept. 7 and fourth in the GIII Jimmy Durante Stakes at Del Mar at the end of November. A half-sister to the multiple graded-placed Join in the Dance ( Sky Mesa ), Cuyathy is the dam of a yearling filly by Knicks Go named Soaring Angel, missed to Mandaloun for 2024 and is due to Maxfield for her 2025 foal.\n“It's JOHANNES ($2.60) taking care of business!” – @FrankMirahmadi\nThe Nyquist ( @DarleyAmerica ) colt won the $200,000 San Gabriel Stakes (G2) at @santaanitapark under @umbyrispoli for trainer @timyakteen .\nMYSTIK DAN is up next: https://t.co/5VcRa4VxbO pic.twitter.com/RDNNprKuRb\n— FanDuel Racing (@FanDuel_Racing) December 26, 2024\nThursday, Santa Anita\nSAN GABRIEL S.-GII , $202,000, Santa Anita, 12-26, 3yo/up, 1 1/8mT, 1:46.50, fm.\n1– JOHANNES, 125, c, 4, by Nyquist\n1st Dam: Cuyathy (SP, $107,923), by Congrats\n2nd Dam: Dance Darling, by Devil's Bag\n3rd Dam: Danzig Darling, by Danzig\nO/B-Cuyathy, Llc (KY); T-Tim Yakteen; J-Umberto Rispoli.\n$120,000.
