  "text": "Windy Walk, the longest shot in the five-horse field, upset her more-fancied Grade I-winning foes with a wire-to-wire victory in the Rampart Stakes Thursday at Gulfstream Park. The chestnut filly was quickly at the head of affairs and was under a snug hold while setting a dawdling opening quarter of :25.82 as GI Alabama Stakes winner and 5-2 second choice Power Squeeze and GI Breeders' Cup F/M Sprint winner and 2-5 favorite Soul of an Angel were second last and last, respectively. Power Squeeze rolled up three wide on the far turn and looked ready to take the lead into the stretch, but Windy Walk kicked away again. Power Squeeze was coming back at her late and Soul of Angel, who had tipped to the center of the track while still last at the top of the lane, was closing rapidly, but the longshot held on gamely to the wire.\nWindy Wind had plied her trade mostly in the claiming ranks in her previous 13 lifetime starts. The chestnut filly broke her maiden versus $20,000 maiden claimers at Keeneland in April and was a well beaten sixth in her only other stakes start to date in the July 12 Wilton Stakes at Saratoga. She came into the Rampart off three straight starter allowance wins: at Churchill Sept. 29, Keeneland Oct. 26 and Churchill Nov. 20.
