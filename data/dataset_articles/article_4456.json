  "text": "New York Takes Monumental Step To Stop Domestic Violence\nNew York lawmakers are pushing a new bill that could dramatically reduce domestic violence.\nTwo New York lawmakers want to create a public registry for repeat domestic violence offenders.\nNew York Lawmakers Want Public Registry For Repeat Domestic Violence Offenders\nState Sen. Mario Mattera and Assemblymember Anil Beephan just introduced legislation that would create a public database of repeat domestic violence offenders.\nFor all the news that the Hudson Valley is sharing, make sure to follow Hudson Valley Post on Facebook, and download the Hudson Valley Post Mobile App\nLawmakers say this would create a domestic violence offender registry that's \"similar to the sex offender registry.\"\nThe goal of the bill would be to \"protect the public when dating, hiring, or going about their daily lives.\"\nIf passed, all New Yorkers will be required to search for individuals who have been convicted multiple times of domestic violence. Only people convicted of at least two domestic violence offenses would appear in the registry.\nEach listing would include the offender’s name, date of birth, conviction date, and a photograph.\nThe bill is modeled after Tennessee’s “Savannah’s Law,” which went into effect in May 2025 following the deadly shooting of Savannah Guzman by her ex-boyfriend. That case sparked calls for stronger public-access tools to track repeat offenders\nSomething New York sponsors say is long overdue.\nSimilar efforts in past years in New York, including on called “Brittany’s Law,” were introduced by New York lawmakers but failed to make it through both chambers.\nKeep Reading:\nStates of Violence: Violent Crime Per 100,000 Ranking by State\nStates of Violence: Violent Crime Per 100,000 Ranking by State\nDeMayo Law Officerecently combed through the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation's Crime Data Explorerto determine which state had the most violent crime over five years (2018 - 2022.)
