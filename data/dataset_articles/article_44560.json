  "text": "The Hudson Valley’s busiest goth triple-threat, musician/DJ/burlesque queen Tryst La Noir , has returned with a new single that’s as “raw, dirty and wild” as love itself, a sonic blast entitled “Goddamn!”\nTryst’s latest is another preview of tunes earmarked for her as of yet untitled third album slated for release in Spring 2025. Earlier this year, Tryst and her collaborator, Brooklyn-based producer/guitarist Steve Woodzell, unleashed a duo of singles from the album “Bathwater Blues” and “Oh Lover” .\nTryst says, “In comparison to my previous albums, this will be my most vulnerable yet. I have been experimenting with instruments and sounds that I never had before. And when it comes to the writing process, especially the lyrics, I am not sugarcoating anything.”\nThe fierce “Goddamn” bears some of the hallmarks of Tryst’s greatest musical influences, including Nine Inch Nails, Nick Cave, Depeche Mode, PJ Harvey, Morphine, and even the bluesy love laments of jazz songbird, Billie Holiday. “I really love old blues music from the 40s, along with 60s psychedelia, 80s goth, 90s grunge and post-punk. My music is a mash-up of all these styles, with an accent on full-on passion and energy.”\nTryst’s newest single slams a slow industrial groove, accented with a dense mix of fuzzy guitars, impossibly big beats, howling synths, and her caterwauling vocals. Lyrically, the song profiles a fiery love affair that sparks a combustible attraction between lovers that comes with an overdose of both passion and toxicity.\nBut music is just one facet of Tryst’s busy career. She also works as a DJ at leading area clubs, including Pearl Moon, Colony Woodstock , and The Avalon Lounge . Tryst also serves as a performer and host of a series of burlesque nights produced by Strangehouse, an event and video production concern she runs with her partner, musician/videographer Byron Frayne.\nLook for Tryst La Noir spinning at Kingston’s Unicorn Bar for its Bowie Birthday Ball on January 24 and her ongoing Friday Night Fever at Colony Woodstock on January 3. She will also bring her burlesque spectacular to the Colony on Valentine’s Day.",
