  "text": "Christmas 2024: Santa in Uniform\n- By Hannah Dougherty HDougherty@CalhounTimes.com\n[Comments](/calhoun_times/gordon_life/local/christmas-2024-santa-in-uniform/collection_e53ed7b2-c21b-11ef-8948-338c4bedfb9b.html#comments)\nGordon County Fire and Rescue organized this year's Santa in Uniform program, giving select County Schools students a chance to visit and take pictures with Santa Claus followed by a Walmart shopping spree. Breakfast was provided to students at Fire Station No. 1, followed by an escort provided by Fire and Rescue, Calhoun Fire Department, the Sheriff's Office, Calhoun Police Department, Georgia State Patrol, AdventHealth Gordon EMS, and Gordon County EMA to Home Depot for Santa photos. From there, the ride continued to Walmart, where the students were given money to spend on gifts they wanted this Christmas, alongside the personnel that made the event possible.\nAs featured on\nThank you for reading!\nPlease log in, or sign up for a new account and purchase a subscription to read or post comments.\nWe have used your information to see if you have a subscription with us, but did not find one.
