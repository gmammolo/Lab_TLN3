  "text": "In a moment that intertwines personal faith with public service, Denzel Washington has officially become a licensed minister following a heartfelt baptism ceremony at the Kelly Temple Church of God in Christ in Harlem , New York, on December 21, 2024.\nThe two-time Academy Award winner, known for his powerful performances in films like Training Day and Gladiator II , described this milestone as a significant step in his spiritual journey.“It took a while, but I’m finally here,” Washington proclaimed during the ceremony. He added, “If [God] can do this for me, there’s nothing He can’t do for you. The sky literally is the limit.” This transformative event was live-streamed on Facebook, allowing fans and followers to witness Washington’s water baptism and the presentation of his minister’s license.\nA Joyous Celebration Archbishop Christopher Bryant officiated the ceremony and expressed his joy at welcoming Washington into the clergy. “We celebrate the addition of Minister Denzel Washington… a truly uplifting moment,” he shared on social media. Washington’s connection to Kelly Temple runs deep; he attended the church as a child, making this baptism feel like a homecoming.\nReflecting on Prophecy During the ceremony, Washington reflected on a prophetic moment from his youth, recalling how Ms. Ruth Green, known for her gift of prophecy, told him at age 20 that he would “travel the world and preach to millions.” As he prepares to celebrate his 70th birthday next week, he acknowledges that this prophecy is coming to fruition.\nFamily Support and Pride His wife, Pauletta Washington, also spoke during the ceremony, expressing pride in her husband’s commitment to faith. “Forty-six years later, here I’m still standing next to him as only God will have it,” she stated. “You are the head of our house, and you have set a great example for our children.”\nChallenging Hollywood Norms Washington has long been vocal about his Christian faith, often discussing the challenges of expressing such beliefs in Hollywood. In a recent essay for Esquire , he noted that discussing religion is often seen as taboo in the entertainment industry. “When you see me, you see the best I could do with what I’ve been given by my lord and savior,” he wrote.As Denzel Washington steps into this new role as minister, he continues to challenge the norms of Hollywood by openly sharing his faith and inspiring others to embrace their spiritual journeys.\nPhoto credit: Wiki.\nLatest Posts",
