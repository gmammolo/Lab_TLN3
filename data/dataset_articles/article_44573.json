  "text": "PHILADELPHIA — It was a great Christmas to be one of the Eagles’ offensive linemen and it didn’t matter if you were a starter or a reserve.\nEvery member of the Eagles’ offensive line showed up at work Tuesday and received a shiny new souped-up gold cart, courtesy of quarterback Jalen Hurts and running back Saquon Barkley.\nBUY EAGLES TICKETS: STUBHUB , VIVID SEATS , TICKETMASTER\nThe team released a video on X Thursday afternoon of the linemen running out of the locker room and toward the golf carts, which were lined up in a row outside of the team’s NovaCare Complex practice facility. Each cart was customized with the name and numbers of each lineman.\nThe video shows second-year offensive lineman Tyler Steen driving through the parking lot as 12-year veteran runs toward his gift from Hurts and Barkley, who happily watch the excitement on the faces of their teammates as they approach their Christmas gifts.\nCenter Cam Jurgens can be seen hugging both Hurts and Barkley before heading for his new ride.\n“ Awesome,” Jurgens said when asked about the gift after practice Thursday. “That thing is fully loaded: stereo system, backup camera. That thing’s badass.”\nJurgens, when asked how he would use it, said, “I might drive it to work.”\n”You know, I haven’t really decided, but it’d be pretty nice just driving around here in the summer or maybe take it down to the shore,” he said. “I don’t know. It might just travel with me everywhere I go.”\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.
