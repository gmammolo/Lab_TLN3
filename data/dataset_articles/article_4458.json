  "text": "The Defiance County Sheriff’s Office has named 2025 award winners in three categories.\nThey are Cole Niese for Deputy of the Year, Courtney Foy for Communications Officer of the Year and Tyson Wasilewski for Associate Deputy of the Year.\nAccording to a sheriff’s office media release, the awards show the “commitment, professionalism and daily efforts” of staff “in keeping our county safe and secure.”\nNiese was recognized for “outstanding performance, leadership and dedication to the community.” A two-year employee of the sheriff’s office, Niese “has quickly distinguished himself through consistent hard work, sound decision-making and a willingness to step into complex or high-pressure situations when needed,” the media release stated.\nFoy was honored for “providing calm, clear and reliable communications during” all types of incidents handled by the county’s 911 center, which is operated by the sheriff’s office. During the past year, “Foy has willingly taken on more tasks within the center, handled complex 911 calls, supported all first-responders during emergencies and provided reassurance to callers experiencing some of the worst moments of their lives,” the media release explained.\nWasilewski was chosen for “consistently going above and beyond in his daily duties and demonstrating exceptional initiative in support of the sheriff’s office mission. With the sheriff’s office for eight years, Wasilewski “has always assisted co-workers without hesitation and shown a strong commitment to providing professional service to the residents of Defiance County,” the media release stated.",
