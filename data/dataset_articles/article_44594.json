  "text": "Sophomore wide receiver Eric Singleton Jr., one of the top skill-position targets in the transfer portal, is headed to Auburn to catch passes from Jackson Arnold. Singleton had a team-high 56 catches for 754 yards and three touchdowns with Georgia Tech in 2024 after posting 48 receptions for 714 yards and six touchdowns as a true freshman in 2023. Auburn announced Singleton's signing Monday on social media. Arnold opted to transfer out of Oklahoma and picked Auburn, which has been extremely active since finishing the season 5-7. Along with Singleton and Arnold, the Tigers landed Wake Forest wide receiver Horatio Fields and Maryland tight end Preston Howard. Texas, LSU, Miami and Ole Miss all pushed to land Singleton. A product of Alexander High School in Douglasville (Ga.), Singleton was rated a three-star recruit in 2023 and had offers from Georgia Southern, Georgia State and Troy but not Georgia. Players who enter the transfer portal are permitted to return to their original school. Georgia Tech (7-5) was selected for the Birmingham Bowl and plays Vanderbilt (6-6) on Friday. --Field Level Media\nOriginally published on fieldlevelmedia.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .",
