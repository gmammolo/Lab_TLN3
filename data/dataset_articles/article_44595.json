  "text": "Life is busy for Russell Williams, but that is exactly what he wants.\nThe 84-year-old has achieved a lot during his career but has also given back to the community in many ways, including as a volunteer with the Buninyong Fire Brigade, in Victoria.\nGrowing up in Scotsburn, Mr Williams joined the building industry in his younger years and built his own home with his wife Carolyn in 1966.\nMr Williams joined the Buninyong CFA in 1978 as a 35-year-old, in what he said was an eye-opening experience.\n\"I just felt like I needed to do something - at that stage, there were a lot of fires around,\" he said.\n\"I thought, 'well, I'm sitting around doing nothing, I could go and help fight the fires'.\n\"The first six months opened my eyes up to what the fire brigade guys do.\n\"One bad fire we went to was out in Scotsburn - we had a big dust storm come over Ballarat a few years ago. I was out in the middle of that with the fire. That frightened the pants off me.\n\"I thought, 'bugger this, I'm going home to resign', but I stayed with it and have been there ever since.\n\"It was quite the frightening day out there.\"\nAnother interesting experience for Mr Williams was during the Ash Wednesday bushfires in 1983.\n\"(Russell) built a house at Aireys Inlet ... it just got it finished, and it burnt to the ground - and then he had to go back and rebuild it,\" Ms Williams said.\n\"That was an experience,\" Mr Williams said.\n\"(The owners) were lovely people; they claimed it on insurance, and we went back and built it again.\"\nFirefighting in the early days\nMr Williams said the gear and techniques used by firefighters in those days were very different back then.\nHe said that in the early days of his firefighting career, they would drive trucks with a 2000-gallon tank on the back and little else.\n\"They went well for the time we had them,\" he said.\n\"There was no breathing apparatus in those days - you just covered your face and got on with the job.\n\"I think the biggest change is the trucks - they're keeping up to date, obviously - and communication, that's amazing these days.\n\"We just had a little two-way radio and that's all it was to it.\"\nHe was the brigade's captain for two years and was also the first Lieutenant for two years during his service.\nHe remained a volunteer until about 1997 when an operation forced him to step back from actively fighting the fires.\nHe was made a life member in 2001.\n\"We had some really nice guys and nice families (in the brigade), and made so many good friends out of it,\" Mr Williams said.\n\"There's so many new members in it now, and a lot of females in it now, which I think is a very good thing. I think they've got a very good brigade over there now.\"\nA special restoration\nMr Williams was also the leader in the restoration of the historic Merrywether Fire Engine.\nThe manual fire engine drawn by a horse and pumped by handfirst hit the streets in Buninyong in 1882, about 10 years after the original fire station was built in 1872.\nIt helped fight a huge blaze that destroyed The Crown Hotel on New Year's Eve in 1884.\nIn 1997, Mr Williams and a group of other workers decided to restore the engine to its former glory.\n\"At that stage, I was only a carpenter involved in that sort of work. I just took it on and the other guys came along and did it,\" he said.\n\"The wheels were all wobbly - they went into Sovereign Hill and they fixed those up and got them straight again.\n\"We had to take it back to the raw paint that was on it and do it all up again.\n\"I remember I made the letters for the side of it, we got another fella in to do the pin striping on it. It was quite rewarding.\"\nThe restoration project took about a year, and is now proudly displayed in a special room at the front of the new Buninyong-Mount Helen Fire Station, opened in 2022.\n\"It's been a good thing for the town to get the new fire station up and running. They're keeping up with the times,\" Mr Williams said.\nKeeping active\nIf you think being a builder for 55 years and volunteering with the fire brigade was enough for Mr Williams, think again.\nHe has been a member of the Buninyong-Mount Helen Men Lions Club for 37 years, of the Bunionyong Cemetery Trust for 12 years, an \"instigator\" of the Buninyong Mens Shed, according to his wife, and has been a member for 12 years.\nHe has also been on the vestry at St Peter's Church in Buninyong for three years and was a cub leader for eight years.\n\"In all, I reckon I've done 113 years of voluntary labour,\" Mr Williams laughed.\n\"You've got to keep active, you can't just sit around doing nothing all day.\"\nIn the six decades they have lived in their Buninyong home, the couple said the town has changed quite a bit, but it still retains its charm.\n\"(It's) progress,\" Mr Williams said.\n\"You can't say it's for the good, you can't take for the bad - just progress, really.\n\"We knew just about everybody in the town a few years ago. It's a lovely place.\n\"Buninyong has been good to us. We've made some lovely friends, and our (four) kids were all educated at Buninyong school ...\"\n\"If you think of Buninyong and how it's changed, I think, when I first came here, there was only the supermarket, or very small supermarket - just a grocery shop, really, a butcher shop, and probably a corner shop,\" Ms Williams said.\n\"It wasn't really anything else very much, and now we've got the chemist, the supermarket - we've got everything, you don't have to go to Ballarat.\"",
