That city's population grew more than 17% from 2020 to 2023, to 8,969.\nWeeks arrived in Navasota in 2022, after serving four years as assistant city manager in La Porte.\nNavasota's growth largely was unplanned, he said, spurred by population spilling down the so-called Aggie Highway from College Station, (Texas 6).\n\"Our current utilities and infrastructure had not been addressed,\" he said. \"We've got the original stuff in the ground.\"\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Navasota dug out, the city working with developers and city planners. Weeks found $1.2 million in sustainable cuts to the city budget, which is $52.3 million this year.\n\"When the council there (in Mineral Wells) saw what I had and bring to the table, they really liked that,\" he said.\nMayor Regan Johnson said Weeks checked the boxes highest on the council's list.\n\"Mr. Weeks has the experience, drive, and desire to be in Mineral Wells that made him the choice for this council as he leads the city staff through the implementation of so many projects, plans and visions that are in place,\" the mayor said. \"We anticipate a smooth transition and great things from Mr. Weeks. We look forward to the future! However, I cannot reiterate enough, how integral Mr. Sullivan's dedication and foresight have been to the continued progress of this city.\"\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in U.S. A baby was found on a Colorado street Christmas morning.

MSNBC Lawsuit reveals shocking new details about one of America's most polluted waterways: 'This canal right here is mutant water' The Cool Down Mom convicted in Michigan school shooting case asks to be released from prison ABC News And not all the faces in Crazy Town are new for Weeks. David Hawes, the city's immediate past economic development director, encountered Weeks in La Porte when the city needed guidance from Hawes' Houston-based consultant firm, Hawes-Hill.\n\"I've had a relationship with David Hawes for at least seven years,\" Weeks said, describing the Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone that Hawes and his staff helped create for the coastal city.\nDuring interviews in Mineral Wells, he met Hawes' successor, Nathan Dyhre, Main Street Manager Brittany Brown, Fire/EMS Chief Ryan Dunn and other city leaders.\nIt's safe to say Hawes put in a good word for Weeks, he was quick to do so when the Weatherford Democrat asked.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"I've had the privilege to work with Mr. Weeks for seven years in La Porte and Navasota,\" Hawes said. \"He is a first class individual and a very professional city administrator. Mineral Wells is fortunate to have someone of Mr. Week's caliber to come here and work for the betterment of our community.\"\nWeeks expects taking three to six months to get his feet under him in his new home. His department heads can expect detailed staff meetings with a boss who holds them accountable but lets them do their jobs.\n\"I'm not a micromanager,\" he said. \"I like to be informed and doing things the best way.\"\nAmong its challenges, Mineral Wells has long faced a high poverty rate — 18.2% in 2022 Census data contrasted with 11.5% nationwide that year.\nAdvertisement Advertisement \"The key to addressing poverty is tied to good economic development efforts,\" Weeks said. \"Residents need to have good wage paying jobs that can support their families. Therefore, recruiting new businesses and industry to MW will aid in providing jobs to the workforce.\"\nWeeks also has researched his new home in social media posts.\n\"I'm very aware everybody's upset about the water rates,\" he said. \"I don't put a lot of stuff on social media, but I do read a lot of social media.\"\nHe also envisions better communications among his own departments.\n\"I heard also, interestingly, there's not a lot of communication happening,\" he said.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Weeks' financial background will help as staff preparations to write the 2025-26 budget get underway early in 2025. Finance Director Jason Breisch left the city for the private sector after this year's budget was approved.\n\"I will be looking for a new finance director,\" he said. \"I've been without a finance director, and it is very difficult to do both tasks at once.\"\nWeeks grew up in Greenville and welcomes the move closer to family. He and his wife, Rhonda, are raising three children in a blended family.\nHis wife is a teacher in the Windham school district, teaching Texas prison inmates for more than two decades with plans to continue after transferring to the Lindsey State Jail in Jacksboro.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Weeks anticipates getting to know Mineral Wells better during his first 100 days on the job.\n\"I'm going to get immersed in the community,\" he said, noting the Mineral Wells ISD Foundation and membership in Rotary.\nHe also plans to meet business owners and the county commissioners in Palo Pinto and Weatherford, since the town he will lead straddles both counties.\n\"The first 100 days are usually all about the relationships and getting those relationships going,\" he said, describing how his grandfather, George Burton, made sure he raked up the grass clippings when he was a young man mowing lawns. (Burton is Weeks' middle name).\n\"He taught a hard lesson to me, and that's how I've operated my whole life, is going that extra mile and meeting people's needs,\" Weeks said.\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 27,876 people played the daily Crossword recently.
