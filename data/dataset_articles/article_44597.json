Jonny Thompson Makes Rare Appearance with Royal Family on Christmas Day Thompson, nicknamed “Major Eye Candy” for his dashing good looks, stepped into a more behind-the-scenes role earlier this year amid social media frenzy over him Rachel Burchfield Thu, December 26, 2024 at 9:59 PM UTC 2 min read\nMax Mumby/Indigo/Getty\nLieutenant Colonel Johnny Thompson, equerry to King Charles III, attends the Royal Windsor Endurance event in Windsor Great Park on day 3 of the 2024 Royal Windsor Horse Show on May 3, 2024 in Windsor, England King Charles ’ “hot equerry” Lt. Col. Jonny Thompson is still on royal duty — and made a rare front-facing appearance on Christmas Day!\nThompson — who opted for a more behind-the-scenes role following the massive amounts of attention he received for his handsome looks — joined the royal family for their annual Dec. 25 walkabout following church at St. Mary Magdalene at Sandringham. In this clip , Thompson can be seen walking behind Kate Middleton carrying armfuls of flowers as the Princess of Wales, 42, wishes members of the crowd a merry Christmas.\nRelated: King Charles' 'Hot Equerry' Shifts Role Out of Public Eye Following Online Frenzy\nMax Mumby/Indigo/Getty\nLieutenant Colonel Jonny Thompson (equerry to King Charles III) attends The Braemar Gathering 2024 at The Princess Royal and Duke of Fife Memorial Park on Sept. 7, 2024 in Braemar, Scotland This past February, Thompson — who became known as the “hot equerry” and “Major Eye Candy” and became an online sensation after King Charles took the throne in September 2022 — transitioned into a new, less public post, The Times reported. A palace source told the outlet that Thompson “remains senior equerry to the King and the Queen, in a more executive and less public-facing role.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Times added that Thompsin is “understood not to have enjoyed the public attention he received after attending several high-profile events with the King.”\nThompson went viral on social media just a few days after the death of Queen Elizabeth on Sept. 8, 2022, and the frenzy only intensified after King Charles’ coronation in May 2023. Thompson is a member of the 5th Battalion Royal Regiment of Scotland and rose through the ranks to become Queen Elizabeth’s most senior bodyguard. He was promoted to Super Equerry to King Charles after her death over two years ago, Tatler reported.\nMax Mumby/Indigo/Getty\nLieutenant Colonel Jonny Thompson (equerry to King Charles III) attends day one of Royal Ascot 2024 at Ascot Racecourse on June 18, 2024 in Ascot, England Related: King Charles' 'Hot Equerry' Joins Royals at Easter After Shifting from Public-Facing Role\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?
