  "text": "By Kelly Fisher Dec 26, 2024\nMiranda Lambert and Ella Langley are seeking a home for a dog before his one-year anniversary in a shelter in Nashville, Tennessee.\nLambert shared a clip on social media earlier this week, capturing the MuttNation founder with Langley and others bonding with the dog, Butter , who is at Metro Animal Care and Control. Lambert’s video notes: “We need your help y’all! Butter has been in the shelter since January 24. Can we find him a home before his 1 year anniversary?!” Lambert added in her caption that Butter “is soooo sweet,” “catches yard moles,” and “is the goodest boy.” It was one of several posts Lambert shared from visits to local animal shelters with Langley, who is a founding board member of Tennessee-based rescue nonprofit Pawsitive Rescue Division.\nMetro Nashville Animal Care and Control shared a post about Butter on Facebook , explaining that although Butter would spend Christmas with a family, he would return to the shelter on Thursday (December 26). Butter, 8, arrived at the shelter at the beginning of 2024 because his owner passed away. Per that post, Butter “loves to go on long walks, play fetch and even take dips in the pool. He is happy to meet lots of people and dogs on outings, especially because of all the pets he gets.” The post also notes that Butter walks well on a leash, is potty trained, loves being around people of all ages, rides well in the car and more.
