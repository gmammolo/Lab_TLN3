  "text": "KSWB articles Tijuana’s famous ‘Zonkeys’ find new home at Ranch near Ensenada Salvador Rivera Thu, December 26, 2024 at 6:46 PM UTC 1 min read\nSAN DIEGO ( Border Report ) — For decades, tourists were able to have their pictures taken with so called “Zonkeys” along Tijuana’s Avenida Revolución — an attraction animal rights activists called cruel as the animals were forced to stand for long hours without much food or water.\nZonkeys are a cross between a zebra and a burro, although these animals were striped with black and white paint, something critics contend also damages the fur and skin.\nThis year, however, the city decided to end the tradition and forced the animals into retirement, replacing them with wooden replicas back in September.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement According to the city of Tijuana, the zonkeys have been moved to a ranch near Ensenada where they will be taken care of and will not be used as props for pictures anymore.\nIn June 2023, the city confiscated the animals accusing the owners of mistreating the zonkeys.\nOne of five painted and malnourished donkeys rescued from property in Tijuana in June 2023. (Courtesy: Baja California State Attorney General’s Office) With pressure from the city, and as a way to avoid animal cruelty charges and fines, the previous owners decided to donate the animals in exchange for visitation rights.\nThe rescue facility has 11 acres of open space and is operated by a family that rehabilitates horses and burros.\n“Now they are roaming free in their natural habitat,” said Alejandro Sandoval, owner of the ranch.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement According to Sandoval, the previous owners are being encouraged to visit regularly to help the animals adapt quicker.\nVisit the BorderReport.com homepage for the latest exclusive stories and breaking news about issues along the U.S.-Mexico border\n“If you leave a burro who has been with you for many years and you abandon it, the burro could die of sadness. They develop a real attachment to their owners just like other pets, such as a dog.”\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
