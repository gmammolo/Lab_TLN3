  "text": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (Dakota News Now) - Wednesday marked the beginning of Chanukah which runs through January 2nd.\nThe Chabad Jewish Center of South Dakota will host a public Menorah Lighting ceremony at the Alliance Sunday, December 29th at 3:30 pm.\n“This year we have a special addition to the Chanukah festivities, a giant seven-foot Menorah built by local children all out of Lego that is going to be something very exciting, you’re not going to want to miss seeing that, a Menorah built entirely out of Lego, we’re going to have Sioux Falls Fire & Rescue dropping from their ladder hundreds of Chanukah treats, gelt, all different dreidels and treats and things that the children love in honor of Chanukah, it’s a special addition by Sioux Falls Fire & Rescue, we did it last year and it was a hit and we’re happy to do it again this year,” said Rabbi Mendel Alperowitz.\nIn addition to the public Menorah lighting, Chabad Jewish Center has two Menorah displays in downtown Sioux Falls this year, one located outside the Wells Fargo Building on Phillips and 9th and another at The Plaza at the Federal Court Building on Phillips at 12th. These public Menorahs are part of Chabad Jewish Center’s mission to make the message of Chanukah accessible to everyone.\n“Chanukah began on Wednesday and it’s an eight-day holiday. Every night of the holiday we light an additional candle of the Menorah, the eight-branch candelabra, every night we light an additional candle to symbolize and remember that a little bit of light dispels a lot of darkness, that’s what Chanukah is all about, to take that message home and live with it the entire year,” said Rabbi Alperowitz.\nMore information about this weekend’s public Menorah lighting, as well as Chabad Jewish Center of South Dakota can be found here.\nCopyright 2024 Dakota News Now.
