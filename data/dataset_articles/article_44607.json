  "text": "Commercial-News, Danville, Ill. Illinois WORKS Pre-Apprenticeship Program celebrates cohort graduation Commercial-News, Danville, Ill. Thu, December 26, 2024 at 8:17 PM UTC 2 min read\nDec. 26—Danville Area Community College (DACC) celebrated the graduation of the 4th cohort of the Illinois WORKS Pre-Apprenticeship Program recently in the Technology Center.\nA total of 19 students graduated from the program, which began at the start of the fall semester and ran for 16 weeks, with classes held Monday through Thursday for three hours each day. These students earned $14.50 an hour while attending school.\nThe Illinois WORKS Pre-Apprenticeship Program, offered in partnership with DACC, prepares participants for registered apprenticeships in high-demand trades such as carpentry, plumbing, and construction. Students earn valuable trade experience and certifications while completing 18 college credit hours toward a traditional degree. Graduates have the opportunity to continue their education at DACC or enter the workforce immediately, a news release states.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement The program is funded by an Illinois WORKS Pre-Apprenticeship grant from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (IDCEO). Over the past two years, DACC has received more than $850,000 to support the program and has applied for funding for a third grant year.\nThe program is currently accepting applications for limited seats in the 5th cohort, which will begin on Jan. 22.\n\"The Nation and the State of Illinois recognize the skilled labor shortage,\" said Professor Doug Hunter, Illinois WORKS Program Coordinator at DACC. \"The Illinois Works grant is a program designed to help alleviate that problem. Good jobs are going unfilled, and the prognosis is that the problem will continue unless additional steps are taken to promote skilled trades. DACC has partnered with Illinois Works to recruit and prepare students to enter DOL-registered apprenticeship programs throughout the State.\"\nFor more information about the program, contact Doug Hunter at d.hunter@dacc.edu or Natasha Pounds at n.merangoli@dacc.edu , or call 217-443-8882.\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 27,876 people played the daily Crossword recently.
