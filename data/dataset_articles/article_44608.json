  "text": "After Suffering Tragic Loss, This Black Ohio Teen Received a Text That Changed His Life Angela Johnson Thu, December 26, 2024 at 8:25 PM UTC 2 min read\nScreenshot: abcnews.go At just 17 years old, Petey Jones has already experienced unspeakable tragedy. In 2017, the Ohio teen lost his father, who died from a heart attack at age 40. Three years later, his mother passed away from an unknown condition on New Year’s Day 2021. In March of that same year, tragedy struck again when a fire destroyed his apartment and took the life of his older sister, Maronique, who had been caring for him.\nAll of that loss took its toll on a then-14-year-old Jones, who didn’t know what he’d do without his family.\n“I was confused, but I was like angry,” he told Good Morning America. “I was mad because everything happened out of nowhere. My whole life changed around in a matter of two years.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement The story of the fire at Jones’ home made the news and moved Ryan Holdren, who was his teacher and football coach at Cincinnati College Preparatory Academy. According to PEOPLE, Holdren, who had been driving Jones to and from football practice since he lost his father, sent Petey a text that read:\n“Hey, I know you got a lot going on, but if you ever need it, you’re always welcome to come stay with me.”\nJones took Holdren up on his offer and moved in with him and his wife Caitlin, where he still lives with the couple and their now-one-year-old son Everett. Holdren is now Jones’ legal guardian.\n“We just wanted to give him something consistent,” Holdren told PEOPLE. “We wanted to provide him with a place where he felt safe, somewhere he could grow up.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Today, Jones is a star football player and honors student, and is working to decidebetween over a dozen college acceptances. He says he doesn’t know where he’d be without the Holdren’s support through his difficult times.\n“They were there for me no matter what, letting me know that I’ll always have a place to call home,” Jones told PEOPLE. “They’re two angels.”\nFor the latest news, Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 27,876 people played the daily Crossword recently.
