  "text": "Wicked 's digital release includes a ton of bonus features and deleted scenes You can defy gravity from the comfort of your couch starting next week. By Emma Keates | December 26, 2024 | 11:33am Screenshot: Wicked Movie/YouTube Film News Wicked × Copy Link Facebook X Reddit Email ! As you’ve probably seen, there’s been a ton of discourse since Wicked ‘s release about whether or not it’s okay to sing, dance, and film while the movie is playing (even some from the stars themselves ). If you’re in the thumbs up camp on that one, you can practice your “Defying Gravity” battle cry undeterred from the comfort of your couch—or broom, if you want to really commit—with the film’s official digital release on December 31. We can’t guarantee that you won’t get a few side-eyes from the members of your own household, but hey, that’s just an excuse to get into character for “What Is The Feeling?” as well. If they’re paying attention (or can focus despite your singing), you’ll probably be friends again by the end.\nIf singing along isn’t your thing, there are still a bunch of swankified treats waiting in the digital release. According to Variety , all Wicked VOD purchases will come with three hours (!) of bonus content. That does include a feature-length singalong version, but there are also multiple deleted scenes, director and actor commentary, a “fantastic behind-the-scenes journey,” and more. The full menu, via Variety , is as follows:\nMost Popular Paramount reportedly doesn't see MTV or Comedy Central as priorities going forward Martin Short spends his Five-Timers Club celebration rehearsing for Saturday Night Live 's 50th The best TV performances of 2024 Singalong Alternative Feature-Length Version Deleted and Extended Scenes Pfannee & ShenShen Meet Glinda: Reunited at Shiz University, Glinda, Pfannee, and ShenShen recall their past by performing a twirling routine together.

Feature Commentary With Jon M. Chu Feature Commentary With Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande While a year is a long time to wait, this should at least partly bridge the very long intermission between Wicked ‘s first and second acts.
