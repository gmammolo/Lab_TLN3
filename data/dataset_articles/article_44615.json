  "text": "How Vanderbilt football is savoring final moments together ahead of Birmingham Bowl Aria Gerson, Nashville Tennessean Thu, December 26, 2024 at 7:17 PM UTC 3 min read\nTo some teams, non-playoff bowl games can be a consolation prize that players aren't that excited about. Instead of participating in bowl practices, some players prepare for the NFL draft or seek NIL money in the transfer portal.\nSo far, though, that hasn't been the case for Vanderbilt football .\nThe Commodores (6-6) had most of their 2024 roster in Birmingham preparing for the game Friday (2:30 p.m. CT, ESPN). Five players who opted to transfer − Devin Lee, Will Faris, Taco Wright, Jeffrey Ugochukwu and Evan Herrmann − are still with the team.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"It means a lot to me, just because I'm a part of something that cares about itself,\" coach Clark Lea said after the team's practice Thursday. \"These guys, they feel a real connection, and they have passion for what this team is and what we're fighting to accomplish. And tomorrow is going to be a celebration.\"\nThe Commodores are seeking their first winning season since 2013 when they take on Georgia Tech (7-5), a team that has had several transfers of its own.\n\"Every moment that we have with each other, it's special,\" safety CJ Taylor said. \"Like Coach Lea was saying in the huddle, tomorrow is the end of Team Four after the game. So just all the genuine connections we built throughout this, this whole process is special.\"\nELI STOWERS How Eli Stowers ended up at Vanderbilt with Diego Pavia? Is the NFL next for tight end?\nVanderbilt injury report fairly clean heading into Birmingham Bowl Vanderbilt hasn't suffered any new major injuries since the end of the season, though the Commodores will be without a handful of contributors who got injured during the regular season. Most notable among that group are AJ Newberry and Zaylin Wood.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Running back Sedrick Alexander, who suffered a lower-body injury during the Ball State game that he played through for the remainder of the season, is one player who has benefitted from the extra rest.\n\"I'm doing great,\" Alexander said. \"Probably the healthiest I've been since I've got injured in Ball State.\"\nWhy Diego Pavia injunction won't be distraction for Vanderbilt football in Birmingham Bowl Vanderbilt has had a busy week for reasons unrelated to the bowl game. Last week, quarterback Diego Pavia was granted an injunction by a court ruling that allowed him an extra year of eligibility to return to the Commodores in 2025. On Monday, the NCAA granted a blanket waiver to former junior college players who would have been in their final year of eligibility in 2024-25, paving the way for offensive lineman Steven Hubbard to also return.\nHubbard played guard for most of the season but was listed as the starter at quick tackle after Gunnar Hansen's transfer to Florida State.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in Sports Bowl game schedule today: Breaking down the three college football bowl games on Dec. 26 USA TODAY Sports United in ‘survival’ mode as Amorim responds to threat of INCREDIBLE relegation Hayters TV Mike Tomlin sums up loss to Steelers perfectly with 2 words Steelers Wire Alabama transfer running back announces commitment to Big Ten program Roll Tide Wire Though the team took its time to celebrate the rulings, Lea said he's preached to the team the importance of staying focused rather than letting the ruling become a distraction.\n\"I think there's a lot of energy around guys that are coming back,\" Lea said, \"I think beyond just Diego and everyone who's made the decision to return, and to kind of build into what we're going to be doing moving forward. There's a lot of excitement. I think what the challenge is, or what the potential distraction is, is to focus too much on what's next, rather than where we are right now. And so again, my challenge to the group from the beginning is to finish well, to finish what we started.\"\nAria Gerson covers Vanderbilt athletics for The Tennessean.
