These artifacts suggested that bowhead whales can and have lived at least 130 years.\nSuch data suggest the bowhead whale – a species that lives in the Arctic – tends to live longer on average. Scientists noted that one bowhead whale lived 211 years.\nHowever, a number of other species can live past 100 years, including blue, fin and beluga whales.",
