But the signature — which appeared to look like a human — was not moving.\nMalibu SAR infrared image of the missing man. December 2024. (LA County Sheriff’s Dept.) “Believing the heat signature was of the missing person, Malibu SAR operators were deployed with medical and evacuation equipment,” officials detailed. “Upon arriving on scene, the rescuers observed the missing man suffering from cold related illness, confused and unable to walk. He was evaluated, wrapped in a blanket, and placed in a rescue basket.”\nThe man was then treated for his illness and put into an ambulance. The sheriff’s department did not share any update on the man’s condition as of Thursday, but called his rescue “a miracle just in time for the holidays” in its X post.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Great work by everyone involved,” Malibu Search and Rescue concluded.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
