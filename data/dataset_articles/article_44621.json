The area where it happened had a \"persistent weak layer,\" the incident report said.\nTranquil Hot Springs Around The Us You Can Visit This Winter To Find Warmth Even On The Coldest Days\nThe avalanche occurred at an elevation of 9,000 feet, according to a notice from the Utah Avalanche Center. \"I could see his hand, his gloves, kind of poking out, waving,\" Braeden Hansen told NBC News about his brother Hunter. \"But, by the time I got to him, he was about 2 feet, his head was about 2 feet under the snow.\"\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"I just cleared the snow away from his head and got his helmet off so that he could start breathing again and then just started digging his body out from there,\" he said.\nAfter one man pulled his brother from the snow, the two men doubled up on a snowmobile and headed out of the backcountry. The two then doubled up and rode out of the backcountry, the avalanche center said.\nThe brother who was buried sustained minor injuries, according to FOX 13.\n\"Those guys had a very, very lucky Christmas Eve,\" Utah Avalanche Center forecaster Toby Weed told the local station. \"No. 1, always access and read the forecast. The forecast that day, it was considerable avalanche as it is the avalanche danger, and that's actually the same danger that it is here in Logan today.\"\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in U.S. A baby was found on a Colorado street Christmas morning.
