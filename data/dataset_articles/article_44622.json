  "text": "Families flood malls the day after Christmas to return unwanted gifts Shanila Kabir Thu, December 26, 2024 at 9:16 PM UTC 2 min read\nThe day after Christmas is informally known as “National Return Day.” Although returns are fairly common throughout the year, they are much more prevalent during the holidays- especially directly after Christmas.\n>>> STREAM ACTION NEWS JAX LIVE <<<\n[DOWNLOAD: Free Action News Jax app for alerts as news breaks ]\nMany are expected to flood stores today to return or exchange the unwanted gifts they received yesterday.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement “I came to the Avenues Mall in Jacksonville because I needed to exchange a few shirts for my grandsons,” said Vicki Burns.\nAccording to the National Retail Federation, store owners expect returns to be 17% higher right now.\n“I don’t blame people. If you’re not going to use it or if it doesn’t fit, it’s better to put it right back so somebody else might buy it,” said Brenda Smith, a St. George, Georgia resident.\nThe National Retail Federation states that 2024 will total out with $890 billion worth of returned merchandise. Today is expected to be a good chunk of that overall projection. However, many shoppers told Action News Jax that December 26th can also mean more shopping at half of the price.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Jacksonville resident, Forrest Sherrill said he rushed to the Avenues Mall to grab a birthday gift for his wife and to check out after Christmas sales.\nOur consumer advisor Clark Howard suggests waiting until the new year, specifically the first week of January to return items you do not need or want. He said you will avoid the crowds and long lines, and possibly take advantage of merchandise at marked down prices. He also advises you not to wait too long, with many retailers enforcing stricter return policies and deadlines.\nThe NRF expects sales this holiday season to be almost 3% higher than in 2023.\nif you are at the mall to shop, return items or do both— retail experts say 2024 will set another holiday shopping record.\n[SIGN UP: Action News Jax Daily Headlines Newsletter ]\nClick here to download the free Action News Jax news and weather apps, click here to download the Action News Jax Now app for your smart TV and click here to stream Action News Jax live.\nAdvertisement About Our Ads",
