  "text": "by Denise 80 Comments\nThis easy keto chicken pot pie soup uses a healthy creamy, cauliflower sauce instead of cream. It takes little time to make and uses items you probably have on hand. This creamy keto soup is great for a busy weeknight meal. One serving has only 5.2g net carbs and 142 calories!\nYou might also like this low carb creamy turkey soup using leftovers.\nI don’t know why but classic chicken pot pie always look so comforting in the colder months. I’ve only eaten them a few times in my life but it’s so cold here in Pittsburgh that I thought it would make a good Paleo-ish and low carb soup similar to pot pie.\nSo today I have for you a keto chicken pot pie soup.This recipe hasno milk, heavy whipping cream, cream cheese or flour to make it thick. All you need is cauliflower to make the creamy base. Pureed cauliflower is great to make creamy soups and sauces.\nOne of the best things about this delicious soup is that it takes very little time and you can use simple ingredients you probably have on hand. It’s the perfect low carb comfort food on a cold day.\nRecipe ingredients I used.\nI used frozen veggies (carrots, peas, corn and green beans), chopped cooked chicken pieces, fresh cauliflower, dried onion, olive oil, garlic cloves, bouillon and some spices. I usually have all that on hand anyway so I can eat this comforting and hearty soup all winter long.\nNot I often use frozen chopped rotisserie chicken in my soups. I keep a batch on hand all the time. However if you want you can cook skinless chicken breasts or use any you have leftover chicken from another meal.\nAre these frozen vegetables low carb?\nYou might be wondering why I used the below frozen vegetables (from Trader Joes) if this is a low carb recipe. I felt that since it was a chicken pot pie soup it needed these particular vegetables. And yes corn, carrots and peas have quite a few carbs but you are only using 1 cup of the vegetables.\nIf you want to lower the carb count just use whatever lower carb vegetables you want and I’m sure it will still taste delicious. . I would not use potatoes though as they are very high in carbs. You can also use fresh veggies instead of frozen but this saves time as there is no chopping!\nHow to make the cauliflower cream sauce.\nOnce you make this creamy cauliflower sauce you will be hooked. It’s great for thickening creamy soups and casseroles without flour or even heavy whipping cream. So if you are gluten free or gluten intolerant, this is a great option for you!\n- The creamy sauce is pretty easy to make. You cut the cauliflower into florets and boil/steam them in a covered pot.\n- When they are very tender, you add them to a high speed blender or food processor along with olive oil, seasonings and some of the cooking liquid.\n- Blend until it has a smooth and creamy texture.\nYou can control the thickness of the soup by how thick your make the cauliflower sauce. So maybe use just ¼ – ½ cup of liquid when making the cauliflower sauce and then you can add more liquid at the end if you want it thinner.\nA note about nutritional yeast.\nNutritional yeast is a popular health food thats often used in vegan cooking. It’s considered healthy because it has protein, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. If you want to learn more about the health benefits check out this article on why nutritional yeast is good for you.\nUsing it in this recipe gives the cream sauce a bit of a cheesy flavor. You could use always use a grated parmesean or romano cheese here if you don’t have any nutritional yeast.\nAnd this is what it looked like after it is blended well.\nHow to make this easy keto chicken pot pie soup.\nI used a lot of short cuts for this recipe so you won’t have to take hours at the stove, chopping veggies or even using a dutch oven. This recipe should take less than 30 minutes.\n- While you are cooking the cauliflower for the cauliflower cream, add the frozen veggies to a soup pan and heat to medium heat. Stir and cook them for a minute or two until they start to soften. I used the veggies below from Trader Joes.\n- Now you are ready to add the cooked chicken. I usually buy a couple rotisserie chickens from Costco and clean of the meat to freeze for recipes like this. Then I take the bones and make bone broth.\n- Stir the chicken and veggies and make sure they are heated through. Mix the\nBetter than Bouillonwith 1 cup of hot water and add to the pan. - Next pour in the finished cauliflower sauce and mix itwell.\n- Let the soup cook for about 5 more minutes to let all the flavors meld. Spoon into a bowl and serve and that’s it! If you want you can garnish with fresh parsley but it’s not necessary.\nStore leftovers in an airtight container. Please scroll down to see and print the recipe card.\nTo make this more of a meal, try it with these keto biscuits and a nice green salad. The biscuits will give that feel of that traditional chicken pot pie flavor.\nRecipeNotes & Tips\n- You can control the thickness of the soup by how thick your make the cauliflower sauce. So maybe use just ¼ – ½ cup of liquid when making the cauliflower sauce and then you can add more liquid at the end if you want it thinner.\n- I love\nhttp://amzn.to/2eXw5E1in my soups. It gives it so much flavor and you only need a teaspoon. However you can use chicken broth or chicken stock in it’s place if you don’t have it. You might want to add a bit more seasonings or salt though. - For the veggies, if you are following a strict Paleo diet, you would want to use Paleo vegetables. Corn is not one but peas and green beans are generally\nthought to be ok.Here is avisual guide to low carb veggiesif you are interested. - As mentioned above, you can substitute parmesan cheese for the\nnutritional yeast. - While this is chicken pot pie soup, it’s also great with leftover turkey!\n- I have an easy keto biscuit recipe that would go great with this. You can make a batch and just serve them along side the soup.\nI hope you enjoy this delicious low carb pot pie soup. And if you get a chance to make it, drop me a line and let me know how it went. Soup is my favorite comfort food and is perfect at this time of the year. Enjoy!\nThe nutritional information for 1 serving of this keto chicken pot pie is: 142 calories / 6.2g fat / 7.4g carbs / 2.2g fiber / 14.3g protein = 5.2g. net carbs\nAnd check out my friend Jenn’s keto pie crust and maybe you can use it with this pot pie soup recipe.\nEasy & Healthy Chicken Pot Pie Soup\nYield: 6\nPrep Time: 15 minutes\nCook Time: 15 minutes\nTotal Time: 30 minutes\nThis easy & healhty chicken pot pie soup uses a creamy, cauliflower sauce instead of cream.

Made a couple of modifications…roasted the cauliflower and carmelized the onions, added to the blender with a carton of ck broth (32 oz…maybe I had more cauliflower but it was still pretty thick.) Sautéed fresh carrots, celery, zucchini, deglazed pan with white wine (1/4 c), then added cauliflower mix, bay leaf and fresh rosemary. Added shredded rotisserie ck at the end. Extremely good! Thank you for this recipe!\nReply\nDenise\nHi Roni, so glad you liked it! Thanks for coming back and sharing your tips….it will be helpful to other readers. It sounds delicious too!\nReply\nDenise\nHow do you get 6 servings when you only added 1 cup of chicken broth?\nReply\nDenise\nHi Denise, this recipe makes roughly 6 (1/2 cup) servings. The 3 cups of cauliflower that you puree with the 1 cup of broth gives you quite a bit of soup. Then you are adding 1 cup of veggies and about 1 cup of chicken. I hope that makes sense. The cauliflower mixed with the broth is the “cream” so to speak. You could always add more broth if you wanted to make it thinner and stretch the recipe a bit. But it will give you 6 servings (1/2 cup each). Let me know you have any other questions.\nReply\nDenise\nThanks for getting back to me Denise. This makes sense now. 🙂 I will have to give it a try. It sure looks yummy.\nReply\nDenise\nHope you like it!\nReply\nPeggy\nI’m hoping to try this today – I actually found this recipe linked to the Paleo Clam Chowder recipe which uses the cauliflower cream. I have been making that clam chowder for a long time and I just want to tell the comment readers that it really doesn’t taste like cauliflower at all. My husband had no clue and we really enjoy it. I know this recipe will be equally as good!\nReply\nDenise\nHi Peggy, thanks so much for commenting and sharing your experience. So glad you like the cauliflower cream. I used it in many of my creamy keto soups.\nReply\nLara\ncan frozen cauliflower be used instead of fresh?\nReply\nDenise\nI think so. I would make sure you cook it according to the package instructions and make sure to drain any water if there seems to be a lot. I hope you like it!\nReply\nBlanche\nHow many ounces is a serving?\nReply\nDenise\nHi Blanche, I’m not exactly sure. This recipe made roughly 6 – 1/2 cup servings but I don’t know for certain of the oz.It’s very thick and dense so you could add more broth and increase the amount per serving if you wish. Hope that helps.\nReply\nTalaia\nYum! Looks delicious and perfect for this cold weather 🙂\nReply\nRachel\nAm I missing something? I feel like I’ve scrolled several times and I don’t find the measurements for the spices for the cauliflower cream sauce. Would you please provide? I’m guessing around a teaspoon of each? Thank you so much! Can’t wait to make it 🙂\nReply\nDenise\nHi Rachel. It’s in the recipe card at the bottom of the post. Here’s a link to the print version of the recipe card and everything should be on that. Let me know if you need anything else and I hope you enjoy it!\nhttps://mylifecookbook.com/wp-json/mv-create/v1/creations/18/print\nDeniseReply\nHilary\nThis was delicious! Turned out just like your picture! I added some of the leftover water & broth as I wanted the soup less thick. Will definitely make this again!\nReply\nDenise\nHi Hilary, so glad you liked it. And I’m glad you know how to make it just the way you wanted to. Enjoy!\nReply\nAlicia Hughes\nThis soup is delicious! I love cauliflower but if you don’t like it, you can’t even tell. So yummy!\nReply\nDenise\nHi Alicia, so glad you liked it! And yes I agree, you can’t even tell. Thanks for coming back to comment.\nReply\nAnn\nHow many servings does this make? There doesn’t seem to be much liquid to yield more than 1-2 servings.\nReply\nDenise\nHi Ann, it makes 6 servings. There isn’t much liquid so that it will be thick. You could certainly add more broth if you wanted. The cauliflower actually provides a very thick cream that thins out with the broth if that makes sense. Hope that helps a bit.\nReply\nMelissa\nHi there! This looks delicious! How much Parmesan cheese should we use to substitute for the yeast?\nReply\nDenise\nHi Melissa, just use the same amount as the yeast.\nReply\nPenny-Lee Fidersek\nCan you use frozen cauliflower instead of fresh?\nReply\nDenise\nHi Penny, I have never tried it so I can’t say for sure but I think it should.\nReply\nTerri\nThis was was easy to make and delicious. Because of the low calorie count, next time I’ll double it. I like the suggestion from another comment of putting it in a crust and making a pie.\nReply\nDenise\nSo glad you liked it Terri!\nReply\nMichele\nThis is so good! I kept my soup thick and poured half of it into a gluten free pie crust and then topped it with another pie crust, baked it until browned and now I have chicken pot pie AND soup! I used Fresh Market California veggies ( carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and chopped red peppers) and followed the rest of the recipe as it is. Honestly, the cauliflower cream was so good, I’ll use this recipe for cauliflower mash in the future. So much flavor! Thank you for sharing such a good recipe!\nReply\nDenise\nHi Michele,\nSo glad you liked it and that pot pie sound yummy! Thanks for coming back to share your tips!Reply\nRachel\nCan this be made in a crockpot?\nReply\nDenise\nHi Rachel, I don’t think so because you want to add cauliflower cream right at the end and the rest doen’t take long at all. Sorry I can’t see how that would work.\nReply\nMaggie\nThis looks amazing, however, my husband is not a fan of cooked cauliflower (or broccoli either 🙁 ) Can anyone tell me how much like cauliflower it taste? Thank you!\nReply\nDenise\nMaggie I really don’t think there is any cauliflower taste. It’s merely in there to make the cream sauce. Maybe someone else will pipe in with there thoughts.\nReply\nJanette\nMy husband hates cauliflower, he could not tell there was cauliflower in this. You can also make a loaded not “potato” soup using cauliflower that nobody can tell by taste that it has cauliflower.\nReply\nDenise\nHi Janette, so glad you husband liked it! I agree about the soup not tasting like cauliflower. Thanks for sharing your tip about the loaded potato soup. I’ll have to try that!\nReply\nMonica\nCan this be frozen\nReply\nDenise\nHi Monica, I think I have frozen this before. It might separate a bit but after you heat it up and mix it well it should be fine. Hope you enjoy it!\nReply\nRory\nNo idea what I did wrong but mine looks nowhere close to as creamy as your pictures. Good flavor. Meh texture :/\nReply\nDenise\nHi Rory,\nI’m sorry it didn’t work out but here are a few thoughts. When you made the cauliflower cream was it thick? You can control the thickness of the soup with cauliflower cream. That is when you puree it in the blender maybe use less liquid? Also for creaminess make sure your cauliflower is very tender and blend well until the sauce is creamy. I’ll try to make this again this week and add better notes. So thanks for bringing it to my attention.Reply\nTarA\nWhat is the one cup of cooking liquid ?\nReply\nDenise\nHi Tara, the 1 cup of cooking liquid is the water that you keep when draining the cauliflower. You could just use a cup of warm water. Hope that helps.\nReply\nStefanie Scott\nHi Denise, this looks fabulous. Can you tell me what natural yeast is ( baking/brewing yeast)? Also what does it do to the recipe? Is it a flavour enhancer? Many thanks, Stef\nReply\nDenise\nHi Stefanie, nutritional yeast just adds flavor. You can easily substitute grated parmesan cheese instead. Hope that helps!\nReply\nCarolyn\nDoes this soup freeze well?\nReply\nDenise\nHi Carolyn, I would say yes. I froze a similar soup and it was fine. You might have to give it a good mix before serving but it should be good. Hope you like it.\nReply\nLauren\nDo you think I could use cashew milk instead of the cauliflower cream? I’m in a keto cook off but it’s the pandemic so I’d rather not run to the store for one thing and I have everything else.\nReply\nDenise\nHi Lauren, I’m not sure what the one thing is that you are missing? The cauliflower cream is cauliflower and spices that have been blended into a cream sauce. Is it cauliflower that you do not have?\nYou could try the cashew mild but it will not be the same because it’s much thinner and I would think that it has some sweetness. I think heavy cream might work better. Let me know about what you are missing and I can offer suggestions.\nReply\nLauren\nYes missing the cauliflower which I know is the key ingredient here I am just home with my 8 month old and hubby is essential service so I can’t go out but perhaps I can get another family member to go for me and get the cauliflower because I’m assuming it makes the soup!\nReply\nDenise\nOh ok, it really does make it thick and creamy but you could use heavy cream and it would taste pretty good but it won’t be thick. Sorry. I hope it works out for you!\nReply\nJan\nMade this soup today eating now and it is fantastic! I did not have the mixed veggies so I used mushrooms. Some carrots ( a few) celery and a few peas and a can of green beans. I love the cauliflower sauce – I really wasn’t sure about it but pleasantly surprised. Did not have the nutritional yeast so used some cheese. So GOOD\nReply\nDenise\nHi Jan, so glad you liked it! The cauliflower cream is surprisingly good huh. I used it in a lot of my soups and in casseroles. I like that you played around with the recipe to make it your own.\nReply\nAline\nI’m loving how creamy this soup is!! So filling and delicious! Thanks!!\nReply\nEden\nAmazing recipe! I love that it’s healthy but it NEVER skimped on flavor. The whole family enjoyed it!\nReply\nJo\nChicken pot pie is must have on chilly days. The soup version of it is interesting. I wish to grab a bowl of this soup right away. It looks filling and delicious!\nReply\nSara\nThis is such a great soup with such great flavor! What an incredible paleo version of a super comforting dinner. Thank you for sharing your recipe!\nReply\nCharity\nHow is this low carb? It has carrots, peas and corn in it!\nYou’re nutrition facts only say the calorie count.Reply\nDenise\nHi Charity, you are right, peas, carrots and corn are higher carb but I am only using 1 cup in the whole recipe so it doesn’t end up having much of an impact. Here is the nutritional information for 1 serving and you can find this info above the recipe card\n154 cals / 7.6g fat / 6.9g carbs / 2.5g fiber / 12.6g protein = 4.4g. net carbs\nIf you don’t feel comfortable using these vegetables, you can try lower carb vegetables such as broccoli, zucchini, mushrooms, green beans, turnips, peppers, etc.\nHope that make sense and if you have any other questions, just let me know.Reply\nJess\nI am loving this healthy rendition of a comfort food classic! I absolutely LOVE chicken pot pie this time of year and I can not wait to try this recipe out!\nReply\nLori | The Kitchen Whisperer\nOh I’m loving how rich and creamy this is! It’s like a hug in a bowl of deliciousness! And I’m LOVING that you used cauliflower cream too!!!\nReply\nPaula Montenegro\nJust the recipe I was looking for! Great way to make it lower in fat. I’ll be making it asap!\nReply\nDanielle\nI wondered what was the dish that I really wanted… It is this chicken soup! 🙂 Love how easy your recipe is – just what I need. And great idea to use cauliflower sauce instead of cream!\nReply\ncindy\nI love soup all year round but especially on chilly winter days like today. I am moving towards eating paleo so this is perfect in so many ways!\nReply\nVeena Azmanov\nLooks creamy,cheesy and delicious. Love such awesome dishes any day. Yum Yum\nReply\nMarisa F. Stewart\nWhat a great idea using cauliflower to make the cream. I’ve never tried nutritional yeast to get the “cheesy” flavor but that is a great idea. January is always the month I try to eat more nutritional dishes and this is a great one to include.\nReply\nAnalida's Ethnic Spoon\nThis sound so delicious Denise and low carb without the pot pie crust!\nReply\nDenise\nThat’s right! It’s quite good as a soup and no flour or cream.\nReply\nFaye Wilkerson\nDenise, Thanks for sharing this wonderful soup recipe. I love shopping at Trader Joes.\nReply\nDenise\nMy husband said that I would be in heaven if they built a Trader Joes near our house (which is true). For me it’s about a 40 minute drive but worth it!\nReply\nDanielle\nThis looks so warm and homey. Thanks for sharing with us at Savoring Saturdays!\nReply\nSarah Ann\nThis looks delicious and I can’t wait to try it! Your other recipes look amazing and I am a new follower now to be sure I don’t miss one. Thanks so much for sharing with the Saturday Soiree Blog Party and Social Media Share.

Thank you for linking up at The Wednesday Round Up and we hope to see you back next week!\nReply\nSuzie\nOk this is a serious must try for me! Thank you! #sitsblogging\nReply\nChristina @ Juggling Real Food and Real LIfe\nHi Denise…….I’m stopping in today from Thursday Favorite Things. I’m with you. I love the smell of butter and onions cooking. I’m always looking for recipes where I can make this happen. LOL! I’m not a big cauliflower fan, but I know it’s good to eat my rainbow of fruit and vegetables so I would like to include more cauliflower. This reipe looks like it might be a nice place to start.\nReply\nBecky at Cooking with Vinyl\nThis looks really yummy, Denise, and really pretty photos.
