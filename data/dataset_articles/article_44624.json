(WFLA) — Two women were rescued after falling approximately 50 feet from a cliff at the Black Diamond Ranch Golf course on Thursday.\nAccording to a release from Citrus County Fire Rescue, rescuers responded to a call for a medical incident at the Black Diamond Clubhouse around 10 a.m.\nOn arrival, they said they found two females that had fallen off a cliff on The Quarry located near Hole 17, where they were left stranded overnight.\nUsing golf carts, CCF said they were able to carry both women to the top of the quarry, and from there, they were transported to a local trauma hospital for further treatment.\nThe incident happened on Christmas Day but went unreported until the next morning.\nBoth women were conscious and breathing upon discovery.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
