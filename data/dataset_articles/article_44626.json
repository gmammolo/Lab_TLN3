He was sentenced on October 22, 2001.\nA commutation reduces an individual's sentence to a specified term, making them eligible for parole consideration and subsequent release consistent with state law, but does not nullify the underlying conviction. To receive a pardon or commutation, an individual must file an application with the Michigan Parole Board. The applications are reviewed by the parole board on a case-by-case basis. Once an application has met the criteria for recommendation, it is sent to the governor’s office for review and a final determination.\n“As a former prosecutor, I am focused on protecting public safety, reducing crime, and building a stronger, smarter criminal justice system,” said Governor Whitmer. “I’m proud of our bipartisan work to help hundreds of thousands of Michiganders convicted of non-violent, low-level crimes get a second chance and reduce crime statewide. Today, we build on that work by granting clemency to eight Michiganders who have taken accountability for their actions. Let’s keep working together to build a justice system that treats all Michiganders equally.”\nStay Connected Like Us Follow Us sbg-envelope\nNewsletter Sign up /sign-up\n© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.
