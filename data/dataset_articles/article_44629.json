  "text": "The Ada News, Okla. Conduit Coders make history Mike Arie, The Ada News, Okla. Thu, December 26, 2024 at 8:55 PM UTC 5 min read\nDec. 26—In a season full of accomplishments, the Conduit Coders saved its biggest for last as they claimed not one but two national championships.\nThe youth coding league team, sponsored by the Ada Jobs Foundation through a grant from Build to Scale, won both the fifth-sixth grade and seventh-eighth grade divisions. No team in the Youth Coding League had ever accomplished this feat.\n\"The Conduit Coders continue to grow and shine even brighter than before, outdoing their previous accomplishments and soaring to new heights,\" coach Sunnie Dawn Baker said. \"In our first season, we finished seventh, and last year we were second.\"\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Fall 2024 season has been a time of exciting growth and new achievements. The Conduit Coders expanded its reach with coders from five different school districts: Ada, Byng, Latta, Roff, and Vanoss. This season, the team also added a seventh-eighth grade team.\nWhile adding teams had always been a possibility, it became a priority when several coders from the previous years were about to age out of the program.\n\"The Ada Jobs Foundation envisions a seamless pipeline of technological knowledge and training that guides students from fifth grade through higher education or into the workforce,\" Carol Ervin, President of the Ada Jobs Foundation.\n\"While the current program focuses on grades 5-8, students face a two-year gap before they can begin studying at Pontotoc Technology Center as high school juniors. Baker and her colleagues are working to bridge this gap, aiming to provide students with a continuous pathway into the digital economy—whether as skilled workers or entrepreneurs.\"\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement This year, the Youth Coding League debuted its curriculum. In the past, they had been using pre-made courses that Google CS First designed. However, they wanted to make sure the program accurately reflected their goals and values, in particular the encouragement of the entrepreneurial spirit being a priority.\nThe theme for the 5th and 6th grade divisions was food. The students were encouraged to explore agriculture technology while also considering how to transform their food innovations into businesses. They worked on designing websites for both information and online ordering, as well as coding projects that could calculate costs and profit margins.\nOnce the regular season was completed, they were challenged with a postseason prompt that asked them to \"design a solution to a problem you see that involves food.\" While there were many great ideas, two projects advanced to the finals.\nThe \"Baby Albino Monkeys,\" a team comprised of Bradalyn Pinley (Roff 5th) and Kayne Scott (Roff 6th) developed a project around the dangers of expired foods, including several games for the users to play. Their project earned fifth place nationally in the Community Favorite category.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in Sports Bowl game schedule today: Breaking down the three college football bowl games on Dec. 26 USA TODAY Sports United in ‘survival’ mode as Amorim responds to threat of INCREDIBLE relegation Hayters TV Mike Tomlin sums up loss to Steelers perfectly with 2 words Steelers Wire Alabama transfer running back announces commitment to Big Ten program Roll Tide Wire \"Fin Fury,\" a brother-sister duo made up of Valor Wilkerson (Ada 5th) and Dalton Wilkerson (Ada 6th), was in the Technical Merit selection from the Conduit Coders. They developed a project where they tackled the challenges of overfishing with an engaging story and several games. Their project earned third place.\nIn the 7/8 grade division, the theme this season was \"The Greater Good.\" The program challenged coders to examine people and organizations in their communities who were making a positive impact and solving problems. The program emphasized the importance of collecting and sharing data, developing a website or app, planning events, and creating commercials to advocate for a cause. In the postseason, they were asked to \"build a solution using technology that makes the world a better place.\"\nThe project that earned the Technical Merit award for this division also became the Community Favorite, advancing to the final round of community voting. Eli Priddle (Ada 7th), William Walters (Ada 7th), and Caisen Herrera (Latta 7th), working as \"The Three Coderteers,\" designed a complex project to help the homeless by providing warm and secure sleep pods that could be delivered directly to those in need.\nWhile the Youth Coding League teaches these coders the basic principles of coding logic, such as utilizing if/then statements, loops, variables, and object-oriented programming, it also teaches them many soft skills.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement They learn how to take constructive criticism and apply it to their projects, revising and improving their work right up to the due date. Along the way, they develop critical thinking skills and perseverance-when their code encounters issues, they keep trying until they find a solution.\nThey also learn the importance of missing deadlines, as missing one impacts the entire team. Most importantly, they understand the value of fulfilling their obligations and commitments, lessons that will serve them well in the future and make them valuable members of their communities.\nTheir commitment and perseverance certainly paid off. Not only did the team achieve first place status, as well as having projects place in the postseason finals, but a total of ten coders were ranked in the top ten in between the two divisions. For the 7th and 8th grade division, Caisen Herrera (Latta 7th) came in tenth, Jake Blanck (Ada 7th) came in ninth, Logan Parnell (Vanoss 8th) came in eighth, and Eli Priddle (Ada 7th) took first place.\nFor the 5th and 6th grade division, six students tied for 1st place in individual standings: Sophia Baker (Ada 6th), Jameson Thompson (Byng 6th), Bradalyn Pinley (Roff 5th), Valor Wilkerson (Ada 5th), Josephine Berman (Ada 5th), and Hadley Howry (Ada 5th). In total, these coders earned $1,950 in prize money, along with kindles and wireless speakers awarded to teams for postseason success.\nAdvertisement Advertisement \"Coach Baker and the whole team at the Ada Jobs Foundation continue to be proud of the coders and cannot wait to see what they create in the 2024 Spring season,\" Ervin said. \"This coming year the team will continue to grow and the students are excited about the new themes. The 5th and 6th graders will be exploring ideas around space, while the 7th and 8th graders will be delving into the world of game development.\n\"While the Youth Coding League shapes the lives of its participants, it also influences the broader community. I am incredibly excited and proud of our nationally ranked coding team right here in Ada. Emerging industries often look into programs like these when researching communities to invest in, both now and in the future.\"\nThrough Conduit Coders, we are investing in these individuals, but we are also investing in the future of our community as a whole.\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 27,876 people played the daily Crossword recently.
