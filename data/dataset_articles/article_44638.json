  "text": "GE Vernova Wins Major HVDC Contract for South Korea’s Largest Power Grid Infrastructure Project Contributed Content Updated Thu, December 26, 2024 at 7:15 PM UTC 4 min read\nBeautiful Architecture building cityscape with tower in Seoul city South Korea GE Vernova said it has been chosen through its joint venture, KAPES, by Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO) to deliver its advanced high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) system, based on line commutated converter (LCC) technology, for the 500-kV Donghaean #2 to Dong-Seoul HVDC converter station project (EP2). This project, part of a larger 4-GW HVDC transmission link, is planned to connect South Korea’s power generation complex on the east coast to the Seoul metropolitan area and is intended to be the largest power grid infrastructure initiative in the country’s history. The EP2 project complements the EP1 project, which is also being executed by GE Vernova through KAPES. Together, EP1 and EP2 projects are designed to provide a stable and reliable power supply to the Seoul metropolitan area, which accounts for approximately 40% of South Korea’s energy demand. Both projects are expected to benefit from GE Vernova’s advanced HVDC technology, designed for efficient long-distance power transmission and enhancing grid resilience to meet growing energy needs. GE Vernova’s scope for the EP2 project includes the engineering and delivery of HVDC valves and control systems based on LCC technology, essential for the stable transmission of large-scale power. The project underscores the increasing demand for technology from GE Vernova’s Electrification segment, which continues to grow rapidly.\nKEPCO’s Vision for a Sustainable Energy Future KEPCO is prioritizing advanced HVDC technology as a critical enabler of South Korea’s energy transition. The EP2 project is designed to provide efficient and stable power transmission to key industrial regions while laying the groundwork for a sustainable and resilient energy network. Yu-won Kang, CEO of KAPES, said, “The EP2 project reinforces KAPES’ position as the leading HVDC provider in Korea in collaboration with GE Vernova, further demonstrating its proven technological expertise and project management capabilities. KAPES is proud to support KEPCO in Korea’s energy transition and play a pivotal role in stabilizing the nation’s power grid.”\nTo learn more about what GE Vernova is doing in South Korea, read how the company is supporting a coal-to-gas conversion at a major power station there .\n“Our Electrification segment is the fastest-growing part of GE Vernova, with significant growth ahead,” said Johan Bindele, business leader at GE Vernova’s Electrification Systems. “We are committed to delivering innovative solutions that electrify the world while decarbonizing it, as electrification becomes critical for enabling a sustainable and resilient energy future in Asia and beyond. We are proud of our 26-year relationship with KEPCO, our continued collaboration reflects our shared commitment to providing advanced solutions that address the evolving needs of power infrastructure.” “Projects like EP2 are pivotal in enabling South Korea’s energy transition,” said Shailesh Mishra, regional leader of Grid Systems Integration in Asia Pacific at GE Vernova. “By deploying advanced HVDC technology, we are not only enhancing the efficiency and reliability of the country’s grid but also laying the foundation for greater integration of renewable energy. Collaborating with KEPCO through KAPES allows us to deliver transformative solutions that align with South Korea’s vision for a sustainable energy future.\nKAPES: Strengthening South Korea’s Power Grid KAPES, a joint venture between KEPCO and GE Vernova established in 2012, has been instrumental in delivering various important projects that address South Korea’s unique energy needs. In addition to EP1 and EP2, key initiatives include the Buk-Dangjin-Godeok HVDC Connection, a 3-GW transmission link supplying power from the Dangjin power plant to Seoul and its surrounding regions, and the Shin-Bupyeong HVDC Link, a 500-MW back-to-back voltage sourced converter (VSC) system in Incheon designed to alleviate grid overloads. These projects collectively underscore KAPES’ role in strengthening South Korea’s power grid and advancing its energy infrastructure.\nThe Role of HVDC in Korea’s Energy Transition HVDC technology is essential in the global shift toward sustainable energy systems as it supports efficient and reliable power transmission over long distances. HVDC systems based on LCC technology use thyristor-based power semiconductors to transfer large amounts of power—up to 8 GW—with low energy losses. These systems’ ability to handle bulk power transmission while providing built-in protection against faults makes them ideal for strengthening South Korea’s power grid and supporting the integration of renewable energy. In South Korea, HVDC aims for enhanced efficiency and stability in transmitting power over long distances, supporting bi-directional energy flow and facilitating renewable energy integration. EP2 is intended to provide a reliable link between the East Coast’s power generation facilities and the high-demand metropolitan area, including semiconductor manufacturing hubs in Yongin, Incheon, and Pyeongtaek. — POWER edited this content, which was contributed by the external communications team of GE Vernova’s Electrification Systems business.\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 27,876 people played the daily Crossword recently.
