  "text": "A team of young dancers from the U.S. Virgin Islands wowed the organizers of the Artistic Dance Exchange’s (ADE) master classes during their trip to Virginia in March of this year, and as a result, the team was invited to participate in ADE’s national competition, taking place in Orlando, Florida, from July 6 to July 12.\n[\n](https://viport.jobs.net/pages?page=featuredjobsjobs)\nDuring the classes at ADE, dancers from FAPA USVI Dance Academy garnered various awards including top overall solo for mini beginners to intermediate, and best in show for contemporary choreography for mini beginners to intermediate, among others. Several dancers also received national scholarships due to the high level of skill demonstrated during the classes.\nAzalea Pearsall led the charge by securing the fist place top overall solo award in the mini beginners to intermediate category, a testament to her exceptional skill and hard work. The team's creative prowess was further highlighted by Lea Scott's contemporary choreography piece \"#110 Lose Control,\" which earned the Best in Show title for the mini beginners to intermediate category, underscoring FAPA's innovative approach to dance.\nThe accolades didn't stop there. Both Azalea Pearsall and Demiah Philip were honored with National Scholarships, acknowledging their outstanding potential and the high level of talent present within the FAPA USVI Dance Team. Additionally, the High Gold Award was bestowed upon Azalea Pearsall, Aysia Frett, and Teagan Campbell, among other significant recognitions, illustrating the depth of talent and commitment among the young dancers.\nDuring the nationals, not only will teams from across the country compete for cash and prizes, but for the first time in 2024, ADE will convene a national dance casting call. Casting directors from across industries – film, theater, television, commercials, cruise and new media – will be present to scout fresh talent, presenting opportunities for dancers to audition for roles in exciting new projects.\nDancers will also be able to audition for a chance to participate in the ADE’s International exchange program, where selected participants will join this year’s production of Ceta con la Danza in Benicàssim, Spain.\nFAPA Director Lea Scott says that the academy is planning a series of events in April, May, and June to raise funds for the team’s upcoming travel. She urged the community to support the Academy’s endeavors as the territory’s young dancers seek to make their mark on the competitive national stage.\n[latest](https://afraz.pk)news straight to your phone with the VI Consortium app.",
