  "text": "When a 4-year-old boy who was born with lung problems wrote to Santa asking for a “big boy\" bicycle to help build up his breathing capacity, Whitfield County firefighters were moved. It was one of dozens of letters received during their first Letters to Santa Project, co-founded by the Whitfield Firefighters Charitable Fund and the Whitfield Professional Fire Fighters Association.\n“Last year, some of our fire stations decorated for Christmas in what ended up being called Operation Reindeer Games,” said Wesley Williams, president of the charitable fund. “So this year we decided to (join) with our professional firefighters and had some mailboxes built for all 12 of our fire stations. Stationery for the letters was printed, and it was so children would have a safe, secure place that their parents could bring them during the Christmas season to mail their letters to Santa.”\nHe described the dual organizations’ efforts as a way to “give back to the community and spread some Christmas cheer.”\n“Originally the goal was to pick 36 children to be able to provide a gift for, and what that was equated to was each station and each (eight-hour) shift would get one kid to be able to take a gift to,” Williams explained. “Thankfully, we were able to fundraise really well with the help of some of our corporate sponsors and actually bought multiple gifts for over 150 kids in our first year.”\nHowever, he added, the eventual outreach of the project will likely be closer to 200 children thanks to numerous corporate and business sponsors.\n“They really helped us out, and we wouldn’t have been able to do that without them,” added Williams. “We also sold some Christmas-designed T-shirts for the Letters to Santa Project.”\nA variety of requests He was asked about some of the more interesting letters.\n“A pretty common item we got was a request for a four-wheeler,” Williams replied. “Another kid asked for $110,000 for his family, which was a very specific request I thought was odd. We’ve had a lot of requests for pets, specifically cats. We were actually able to partner with Whitfield County Animal Shelter and fill one of those requests for a cat. They vetted it and made sure it was spayed before it was re-homed. (The shelter) is actually still looking for a few (pets) for people that are willing to wait till after Christmas.”\nIt was the 4-year-old boy’s letter that was “really, really impactful.”\n“He wrote the letter himself, and his mother made an attachment to it telling us about how he had some health problems when he was born,” began Williams. “He spent six months in the hospital at birth and lost part of one of his lungs on ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation lung machine), and one of the things he asked Santa for at Christmas was a ‘big boy’ bicycle. Because he’s been working on his balance and building (up) his breathing so he doesn’t get out of breath when he does stuff.”\nStation No. 2 in Varnell got to fill the request.\n“I reached out to his mother the other day and talked to her, and they’re going to take him a bicycle and a helmet,” Williams said. “We’ve got him some Batman toys because that was his favorite (character). So when you start reading those letters, one like that really pulls on your heartstrings. That was one of the ones where we said, ‘We’re going to take care of that little boy.’”\nA Facebook post from the Whitfield Professional Fire Fighters Association page gives a parent’s response to Letters to Santa:\n“Our boys participated in the Letters for Santa at our local Fire Station No. 2 and were selected. Our firefighters, (who are) also Santa’s helpers, came out to special deliver Christmas magic and presents! The boys couldn’t believe their eyes and were so excited! We are very thankful for everything you all did and continue to do, (and) especially for keeping our community safe and delivering amazing memories!\n“P.S. — Station No. 2 has the best Christmas decorations!”\nSponsors of the Letters to Santa Project included MFG Chemical LLC, Textile Rubber & Chemical Co., Innovative Risk Services, Dalton-Whitfield Mechanical, WGB Industrial Sales, Tate Hauling (Amber Stephens Tate), Ford of Dalton, Shaw Floors, North Georgia Toyota, Nelson Tractor Co., Manly Steel, Professional Testing Laboratory Inc., Creative Metal Cuts and the Dalton Print Shop.\nReact to this story: Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n(0 Ratings) Tags Santa Claus Firefighter Trending Video Featured Local Savings NEWSPAPER ADS Trending Recipes Obituaries Burns Jr., John Youngblood, Lester McDonald, Clarice Richards, Patsy \"Pat\" Ruth Taylor Roman, Emily Todd, Johnson Hall, Robert More Obituaries Most Popular Articles Images Videos Commented Articles Greene explains vote on budget bill Carol's Fashions, Big Lots to close UPDATED: Dalton High has its new head football coach Southeast Whitfield High School principal resigns following allegations of 'misconduct' Pierce sworn in as Whitfield County sheriff, takes office Jan. 1 'Really grateful': Dalton man happy to spend first Christmas in new home Dalton High School close to naming football coach Area Arrests for Dec. 21/22 Area Arrests for Dec. 24/25 Prewett sees Dalton High head coach position as 'big-time opportunity' Images Videos Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.\nCommented Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.\nGet Breaking News Sign up now to get our FREE breaking news coverage delivered right to your inbox.\nSign-up",
