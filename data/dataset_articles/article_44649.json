  "text": "Mary Brown went from registered nurse to a registered nursery.\nFrom putting in an IV, to putting in ivy.\nThe beginning of a walkway by Brown’s Design Landscaping Inc. & Nursery. (Submitted) The former registered nurse from Grafton, along with her husband and family, decades ago shifted her focus to running a successful landscaping business and beautifying southern Lorain County.\nBrown’s Design Landscaping Inc. & Nursery started modestly in 1985 when the husband-and-wife team of Mary and Rick Brown wanted to start something different than what each was doing.\nMary is a registered nurse, and Rick worked with and trained racehorses.\nFrom their 17-acre farm at 12590 Durkee Road in Grafton, the business took off.\nIt provides, as the name suggests, landscape design and construction, including hardscapes, waterfalls, pavers, decks and even irrigation systems.\nThey work with builders and homeowners, as well as commercial installations.\nAnd, while the recent economy has felt soft for many businesses, Brown Landscaping and Design has been going strong.\nBut, unfortunately, they experienced a labor shortage and encouraged folks to apply a craft that lets them get outside, be creative and earn a good living.\n“We’ve been doing very well at the nursery, and business in general has been really good,” Mary Brown said. “That’s not the part that’s been impacted by the economy.\n“We can definitely tell the difference in the labor pool. That’s the biggest dilemma which most of us face is the fact that trying to find some good labor to do the work.\n“That has forced us to scale back a bit. If you can put a pair of boots on and some gloves on, you can hold a shovel and rake and plant, we want to hear from you.\n“We’re still doing a lot of planning and things,” she added. “And we have the nursery, where we grow all the plants that we sell, so that definitely keeps us all busy.”\nAnd from that nursery, Brown said evergreen trees have been hot items, including such varieties as arborvitae, spruces and giant thula trees.\nMaple trees continue to be popular, along with flowering trees such as weeping cherries and redbuds, she said.\n“Norway spruces right now seem to be the most popular type because of privacy, so we grow a lot of that kind of stuff,” Brown explained. “This is a tremendous place to operate a business because there’s so much business around here.”\nThere is a lot of building going on, she said.\nThe landscaping the company is doing now is so much more complex than it was 30 or 40 years ago, Brown said.\n“Back in the ’70s, folks would put in some green plant and call it landscaping,” she said. “Now, there’s so much more on the market today that we have to choose from.\n“Beauty sells, so if it’s beautiful, we try to use it. I like working in this industry because the product of my labor has been successful. We work with our family.\n“It’s super family-oriented. Our grandson comes out when he’s not in school and he helps.”\nThe process of hiring a landscaper is pretty simple.\nA representative will come to the location and provide an estimate.\nThe Brown team then lays out the plans for the work and even brings clients through its nursery to look at and select the plants they prefer.\nThe team provides computer-aided design drawings for clients, and, upon approval, the team gets to work.\nBrown added that good landscaping and hardscaping, while beautifying the home, also add significant value to the house.\nHowever, that value is nothing compared to the years of enjoyment folks get from admiring, using and being part of their natural environment, she said.\nFor more information, visit facebook.com/brownsdesignlandscaping or call 440-748-2642.",
