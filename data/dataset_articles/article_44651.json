  "text": "[Celebrity News](../)\nMark Anderson, Barbara Alyn Woods Pose With Blended Family for Holidays\nMark Anderson and Barbara Alyn Woods rang in the holidays with their blended family.\nIn a sweet snap uploaded via Instagram on Thursday, December 26, Anderson, 57, and Woods, 62, stood on a stairwell with their children surrounding them. The men rocked matching monochromatic navy blue loungewear while the women in the family wore long-sleeve striped pajamas.\nMark’s daughter Kelsey Anderson and her fiancé, former Bachelor Joey Graziadei, posed underneath the Golden Bachelorette alum and Woods. His other children, Matthew, Taylor, Pascal and Jordan, and her kids, Natalie, Emily and Alyvia, were also photographed. (Mark [shared his kids](//www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/the-bachelor-season-28-contestant-kelsey-andersons-family-guide/) with late wife Denise, while Woods coparents with estranged husband John Lind. The exes filed for divorce in May.)\n“It’s giving hallmark Christmas movie,” Natalie captioned her Instagram Story pic, which Kelsey reposted.\nWhile Mark and Woods have been tight-lipped about the status of their relationship, Graziadei confirmed their romance during the Friday, December 20, episode of the “Bachelor Happy Hour” podcast.\n“We are going to actually spend it with Kelsey’s family and Mark’s new girlfriend as well … which is gonna be great,” Graziadei said. “Barbara’s awesome.”\nThe former Bachelor noted that it would not be the first time he and Kelsey met the One Tree Hill alum.\n“We’ve gotten a chance to go out to dinner with her and her family, when Mark came to L.A.,” he said. “We spent Thanksgiving with my family. We’re spending Christmas with hers, and we’re excited for it.”\nAfter Mark was sent home by Joan Vassos on The Golden Bachelorette season 1 earlier this year, Kelsey [commended her dad](//www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kelsey-anderson-on-rumors-dad-mark-could-be-the-golden-bachelor/) for trying to find love on the reality TV series. (Kelsey’s mom, Denise, died in 2018 following a battle with breast cancer.)\n“I think that he grew a lot from it and I’m just really proud of him,” Kelsey told Us in October. “I’m also really thankful for Joan in helping my dad through all of this.”\nDays later, Mark sparked romance rumors with Woods in October when they were photographed in matching Halloween costumes.\n“When Cinderella and Prince Charming have a baby,” Woods captioned her Instagram post of the twosome as the Disney characters, referring to daughter Natalie, who was dressed as Grogu from The Mandalorian.\nThe pair has since offered glimpses of their time together and [shown subtle support](//www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/barbara-alyn-woods-celebrates-joeys-dwts-win-amid-mark-anderson-rumor/) for one another. After Graziadei won season 33 of Dancing With the Stars in November, Woods took to her Instagram Story to celebrate him.\nIn her post, shrieks could be heard in the background after Graziadei and his partner, Jenna Johnson, were crowned the newest champions.\n“CONGRATS @joeygraziadei,” Woods wrote via her Instagram Story at the time, alongside a clip of Graziadei and Johnson. In the video, Woods tagged her three children, who were seen watching with their jaws open.\n[World News](/)||\n[Latest News](/news)||\n[U.S. News](/news/us-news)\n[Source link](//www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/mark-anderson-barbara-alyn-woods-pose-with-blended-family-for-holidays/)",
