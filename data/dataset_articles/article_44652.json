  "text": "[United Kingdom](../)\nMarco Silva: Fulham manager’s reputation enhanced by historic Chelsea win\nHe has been the beneficiary of finally putting down roots at a club, allowing his coaching prowess – recognised throughout his career – the time to take effect.\nHe was highly-regarded at Hull City, even though his five-month spell from January to May 2017 ended in relegation.\nSilva made an impressive start after being appointed Watford manager, but his head was turned when approached by Everton in November, following the sacking of Ronald Koeman. The advances were rejected amid acrimony but Watford’s form went into decline.\nBefore Everton’s approach, Watford only lost four out of 11 games but afterwards they suffered defeat in eight of the next 13. Silva was sacked in January.\nWatford pointed the finger of blame firmly in Everton’s direction in their statement, at the time, saying: “The catalyst is that approach, something which the board believes has seen a significant deterioration in both focus and results to the point where the long-term future of Watford has been jeopardised.”\nEverton eventually got their man in summer 2018, but cast him aside 18 months later before Silva’s managerial journey took him to Craven Cottage.\nSilva now looks and sounds like a different man.\nAnd this win at Chelsea was a coaching masterclass as he revealed how it was planned.\nHe said: “We knew Neto would push up on Chelsea’s right so we wanted to expose those spaces. This was our plan and we did it better in the second half with Antonee Robinson and pushing on.\n“We wanted to expose that area in the way we prepared then get more bodies in the box in the second half, which we did and got our goals. If people think we deserved to win this match then I would agree with them.”\nFulham’s fans have come to idolise their manager, as proved by the wild outpouring of joy at the final whistle – and the feeling is mutual.\nHe said: “Football is about connections. Connections between fans, players and staff, means something really big. The most important thing is for the fans. It’s not about me at all.\n“Some of the speeches before the game were about the fans. It’s been a long time [not winning at their neighbours]. We deserved it. We controlled more of the game. We didn’t give them chances.\n“In the second half we started to make better decisions. All the good actions of the game give us confidence.”\nSilva’s connection with Fulham and the club’s fans looks unbreakable – and he appears to be a manager who has finally found a home.\n[World News](/)||\n[Latest News](/news)||\n[U.S. News](../../us-news)\n[Source link](//www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn54gpv6wz1o)",
