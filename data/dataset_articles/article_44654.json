  "text": "BLOOMINGTON — Illinois Wesleyan University is partnering with For A Better Tomorrow to host the second STEAM Olympics Competition.\nThe competition will be available to local students in first grade through high school for the multi-day event from Feb. 22-23 and March 1-2.\nThe event will take place at the Center for Natural Sciences, 201 E. Beecher St. in Bloomington, and will feature more than 10 activities in technology, engineering, arts and mathematics to offer hands-on learning with 3D printing, art workshops, essay writing, science and math tests, as well as a science fair.\nRegistered participants and their families will also have access to optional laboratory tours on Illinois Wesleyan and Illinois State university campuses to witness real-world applications of STEAM fields.\n“New workshops have been added — including the design-a-thon, speech and debate, and the STEAM Quest — each designed to challenge participants and celebrate their talents,” said Dakesa Piña, vice president of inclusion excellence at IWU.\nPeople are also reading…\nPiña is leading the event in partnership with For a Better Tomorrow, which is a Bloomington-based organization that strives to promote social justice through philanthropy and nurturing future generations of servant leaders within the community.\n\"We had 235 registrations and 128 students who participated in the inaugural STEAM Olympics. This is a testament to the need for such an event in our community and the quality of volunteers who brought their enthusiasm to the planning,\" said Sambisvarao Gurijala, 2025 STEAM Olympics co-chair.\nThe STEAM Olympics will conclude with an award ceremony and keynote address, with medals presented to the top scorers in each grade. The school with the most medals will win a championship trophy and cash prize.\nProceeds will benefit both IWU and FBT to support various initiatives, including grants for local and global projects for FBT and needs-based scholarships for IWU students who are actively involved with social justice and community engagement.\nRegistration is available at\nforbettertomorrow.org/steam. Early registrations are available at a discounted price until Dec. 31. Participation will be granted on a first-come, first-served basis. Event fees will be waived for individuals with financial barriers.\nFor more information about the STEAM Olympics or to inquire about sponsorship opportunities, contact Sam Gurijala at or 309-838-5254.",
