  "text": "(Photo by Quinn Harris/Getty Images)\nThe Detroit Lions are bringing back a familiar face in a very intriguing news story.\nAccording to NFL Network insiders Ian Rapoport, Tom Pelissero, and Mike Garafolo, quarterback Teddy Bridgewater is coming out of retirement and is now expected to sign with the Lions.\nBridgewater retired after last season to coach high school football in Florida but is now back in the league.\nQB Teddy Bridgewater coming out of retirement, expected to sign with Lions. (via @rapsheet , @tompelissero , @MikeGarafolo ) pic.twitter.com/PK6ShszNKO\n— NFL (@NFL) December 26, 2024\nThe Lions were the last team that Bridgewater was with before he went to coach Miami Northwestern to an eventual state title.\nA former Pro-Bowler, Bridgewater now has a chance to likely provide the Lions with a veteran presence in the quarterback room behind starter Jared Goff.\nThe 32-year-old Bridgewater was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the first round back in 2014.\nHe spent four years with the Minnesota Vikings and joined the New York Jets in 2018 after overcoming a gruesome leg injury incurred during practice in 2016.\nThe former Louisville star would also go on to play for the New Orleans Saints, Carolina Panthers, Denver Broncos, and Miami Dolphins before heading to Detroit in 2023.\nAfter almost an entire season away, the former All-Big East performer is back with his old team.\nHis experience with Lions head coach Dan Campbell is also a bonus.\nThe two spent the 2018 and 2019 seasons together with the Saints in New Orleans before reuniting with the Lions in 2023.\nThe Lions quarterback room will now consist of the aforementioned Jared Goff, Bridgewater, and young Hendon Hooker.",
