  "text": "Police urge travelers to stay safe this holiday season\nSTATESBORO, Ga. (WTOC) - As people pack up their cars and head back home from their holiday festivities, there are a few traffic and safety concerns law enforcement officials want to remind travelers of for the rest of the holiday season.\nTravelers on the road the day after Christmas say traffic wasn’t as terrible as they anticipated or at least compared to years past.\nHowever, Statesboro Police Captain Jared Akins says with New Years Eve soon his biggest travel concern is DUI’s.\n“Some holiday periods are worse than others as far as the number of accidents and number of DUI arrests,” said Akins. “This one has been fairly average so far. So, we just want to keep it that way and make sure everyone gets home safe from the holidays.”\nAkins says that the Statesboro Police department made a handful of DUI arrests on Christmas night even in a college town with almost half the population out of town.\n“Everybody is out and about looking for those impaired drivers,” said Akins. “Just making sure everybody just gets home safe and gets through the New Years period.”\nAkins says that in this day and age rideshare options during the holidays should never be overlooked even in smaller rural communities where people may assume they don’t receive the service.\nHe also wants to remind people to look out for one another.\n“Just watch out for one another,” said Akins. “If you are out enjoying the holiday season, just be cognizant of the other people you are with. If somebody looks like they have had too much or they are not in a position to go out and drive make arrangements for them, take care of them as best you can.”\nIf you are on the road traveling this holiday season, officials just want to remind you to be patient and remember that safety always comes first.\nCopyright 2024 WTOC.
