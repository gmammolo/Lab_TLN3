  "text": "“This isn’t the end. This is the beginning.” Confident [Patrick Mahomes](http://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/patrick-mahomes//?utm_medium=website&utm_source=website_internal&utm_campaign=web_link_3) said this after marching towards his locker room, donning a shiny Santa Claus-style coat on Christmas Day. It was a special win for the entire [Kansas City Chiefs](https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs//?utm_medium=website&utm_source=website_internal&utm_campaign=web_link_5) community. But for Mahomes’s family, it was extra special for sure!\nWhen it comes to the quarterback’s family, we cannot forget the proud mother of Patrick Mahomes. Momma Randi Mahomes recently shared a Christmas update with her fans, revealing how the holiday went for her. So, how was it?\n“Amazing Christmas Day with all my favorite people, FaceTime my daddy!!! And of course, Chiefs Win!!! #BLESSED.” The 53-year-old momma seemed to celebrate December 25 of this year very well. Indeed, it was great to see her ill dad on a video call, and wish him the best this Christmas. In addition, the big win of her quarterback son and his team surely was the cherry on the cake for her.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nAmazing Christmas Day with all my favorite people, FaceTime my daddy!!! And of course Chiefs Win!!!\n[#BLESSED]— Randi Mahomes (@tootgail)\n[December 26, 2024]\nNo doubt, Randi Mahomes has been one of Patrick Mahomes’s biggest supporters. Continuing to show her support for the three-time Super Bowl champ, Randi, who is currently vacationing in New York, shared a picture carousel with her fans a day ago on Instagram. And guess what? In the very first picture, Momma Mahomes showcased the Amazon Prime NFL banner, which prominently featured the quarterback.\nNow that Patrick Mahomes and his Chiefs have improved 15-1 this season, it’s definitely a big day for the Chiefdom and the Mahomes family. But there was one other thing that was special that Christmas night.\nPatrick Mahomes left his wife Brittany emotional on December 25!\nThe Chiefs’s men probably didn’t sleep while returning from [Pittsburgh](https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers//?utm_medium=website&utm_source=website_internal&utm_campaign=web_link_1). As shown in multiple footage, the entire roster was elated with excitement on Christmas night. But [Brittany Mahomes](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/brittany-mahomes//?utm_medium=website&utm_source=website_internal&utm_campaign=web_link_3) was probably more excited than others. Why? Well, the reason is, of course, her husband Patrick Mahomes, and his promise.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nAfter the game, when a curious reporter asked Patrick Mahomes about how special this win was, Mahomes replied, “I told my pregnant wife I was going to get the number one seed so that we can have the baby.” Yes, Patrick confirmed that he earlier promised her to clinch seed #1, assuring Brittany about the Chiefs’s future and his performance. And of course, he did it. Hence, sharing the same quote on her official IG account, [the pregnant momma wrote](https://www.essentiallysports.com/nfl-active-news-pregnant-brittany-mahomes-sends-four-word-christmas-message-after-patrick-mahomes-fulfilled-one-seed-promise//?utm_medium=website&utm_source=website_internal&utm_campaign=web_link_3), “Always keeping his promises (with emotional and white heart emojis).”\nWell, Patrick Mahomes is definitely the man of words!\nDebate",
