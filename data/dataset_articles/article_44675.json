  "text": "Despite Harley-Davidson embracing change with liquid-cooled mills, the old-school air-cooled V-Twin models have an evergreen charm. This is also why, in 2024, we have more air-cooled Harleys than liquid-cooled ones. These bikes also have barely any plastics (much of it is American metal), meaning an affordable price is quite the challenge. But with over 120 years of expertise, Harley has somewhat cracked the code today.\nNo Thanks, Keep Reading\nThat's why the American big twin with the most torque under $20,000 is a muscular Harley-Davidson. We can even pit it against the Ducati Diavel in terms of sheer visual appeal and drama. Yes, this is an apple-to-orange comparison, and the Ducati is clearly a lot more powerful. But it is still gravely low in torque at 93 pound-feet. The Harley produces over 120 pound-feet of torque while costing $7,000 less. Let's delve deeper and tell you how Harley has pieced together a minimal yet muscular and sporty cruiser.\nTo ensure accuracy, the information compiled in this article was sourced from authoritative sources, including the respective manufacturers’ (Harley-Davidson and Indian Motorcycle) official websites.\n[Related\n](/harley-davidson-most-torque-under-15000/)\n[\nThe Harley-Davidson With The Most Torque Under $15,000\n](/harley-davidson-most-torque-under-15000/)\nThe Harley-Davidson, with the most torque under $15,000, is also its most affordable big twin.\nThe Low Rider S Is The Harley-Davidson With The Highest Torque Under $20,000\nTorque: 125 LB-FT\nThe Low Rider S's grin-worthy torque figure is courtesy of one of the biggest air-cooled V-Twin engines on Harley-Davidson motorcycles. This 1,917cc air-oil-cooled unit puts 125 pound-feet of torque at just 3,500 RPM. With such an early surge, you should fear snapping the neck because of the insane torque. But thankfully, all that metal brings considerable heft to counter the jolt of power.\nThat way, the torque-to-weight ratio is just right, proposing a balance between not being overwhelming and lousy. This V-Twin is a low-compression long-stroke engine coupled to a cozy six-speed gearbox tuned for the long haul with tall gears. Harley-Davidson also offers optional Screamin' Eagle performance air cleaners to add some extra grunt and performance drama to the Low Rider S.\nEngine Specs\nEngine Configuration |\nV-Twin; Air-Oil-Cooled |\nEngine Displacement |\n1,917cc (117 cu-in) |\nBore X Stroke |\n4.075 X 4.5 inches |\nCompression Ratio |\n10.2:1 |\nPower |\n103 HP |\nFuel System |\nElectronic Sequential Port Fuel Injection |\nTransmission |\n6-Speed |\nHow Fast Does The Harley-Davidson Low Rider S Go?\n0-60 MPH: <4.5 Seconds\nMinimal bodywork and a huge V-Twin with oodles of torque is a recipe for fun. Harley-Davidson has curated this \"West Coast custom\" cruiser with an elevated affinity for performance. The early surge of its meaty torque helps the Low Rider S sprint to 60 mph in an impressive 4.11 seconds. The top speed is rather restricted at around 115 mph because of a low peak power rating of 103 horsepower. The widely spaced gearbox on this muscular cruiser is also clearly not tuned for high-speed runs.\n[Related\n](/why-torque-matters-more-than-horsepower-on-a-motorcycle/)\n[\nHere's Why Torque Matters More Than Horsepower On A Motorcycle\n](/why-torque-matters-more-than-horsepower-on-a-motorcycle/)\nHorsepower numbers are important, but it's time torque gets the attention it deserves\nPerformance Numbers\n0-30 MPH |\n1.83 seconds |\n0-60 MPH |\n4.11 seconds |\n0-100 MPH |\n9.6 seconds |\nTop Speed |\n~115 MPH |\nSourced from CycleWorld Road Test Runs\nHere's What Makes This Air-Cooled V-Twin Harley So Athletic\nComes With A Balanced Combination Of Suspension, Brakes, Tires, And 'Low' Weight\nThe rumbling big twin on the Low Rider S surely packs the punch to put a wide grin on your face. But Harley-Davidson has also assembled a solid hardware package that complements this torquey cruiser's eager nature. It utilizes the popular Softail chassis, but the frame has been tweaked to make it stiffer and more enduring.\nSuspension duties are taken care of by Showa inverted forks up front and a hidden monoshock at the rear. The front suspension is non-adjustable whereas the rear has preload adjustability. Dual 300 mm discs coupled to 4-piston calipers ensure firm stopping power that works in tandem with cool-looking alloy wheels. These hoops are wrapped with the Harley's staple Michelin Scorcher 31 tires.\nThe tires are also chunky for the compact form factor, which this Harley flaunts, elevating the muscular appeal. Above all this, its conservative curb weight of just 679 pounds gives the Low Rider S an impressive performance-to-weight ratio. Much of it is concentrated low to give it a low center of gravity for solid stability on high-speed straights.\nHardware Specs And Weight\nFront Suspension |\n43 mm inverted front forks; 5.1 inches of travel |\nRear Suspension |\nCoil-over monoshock; 4.4 inches of travel |\nFront Tire And Wheel |\n110/90 Michelin Scorcher 31 wrapped around a 19-inch cast aluminum wheel |\nRear Tire And Wheel |\n180/70 Michelin Scorcher 31 wrapped around a 16-inch cast aluminum wheel |\nFront Brakes |\n4-piston fixed calipers coupled to dual floating rotors |\nRear Brakes |\n2-piston floating caliper coupled to a single floating rotor |\nCurb Weight |\n679 pounds |\nBoasts A Sporty And Muscular Design\nA Factory-Ready West Coast Custom Bike\nThe Southern California Custom bike reference is very strong with the Low Rider's design. It's minimal yet muscular, featuring a sleek tank with a central plastic sleeve that houses the \"FXLRS\" badging. The \"Harley-Davidson\" logo on the tank gets a dropped \"H\", a visual cue seen on early Harley racebikes. Blacked-out components, including the engine and exhaust system, further elevate its sporty visual appeal.\nThere are traces of chrome, restricted to the engine fins. Beautifully contrasting the dark elements are matte dark bronze cast aluminum wheels that come standard here. The trimmed fenders elevate its muscular appeal, especially with those Michelin tires being filled in. This solo-seat Harley comes in four gorgeous shades; our favorite is the one showcased above—Sharkskin Blue, the most expensive color option at $650.\n[Related\n](/top-10-harley-davidson-low-rider-models/)\n[\nTop 10 Harley-Davidson Low Rider Models\n](/top-10-harley-davidson-low-rider-models/)\nThe Low Rider is one of the most iconic Harley-Davidson cruisers to ever bless America\nRegarding options, Harley offers many accessories for the Low Rider S. The performance front includes three types of air cleaners. Styling and comfort get a lot more attention, meanwhile. Notable style-enhancing accessories include a sissy bar, a quarter fairing, and a flat-out bar. Comfort add-ons include three types of two-up seats, relaxed footpegs, and hand grips. It also gets optional saddlebags for those who want to go further on this \"sporty\" air-cooled Harley.\nNotable Design Features\n- Mini quarter front fairing\n- Blacked-out two-into-two exhaust system\n- Elevated handlebar position courtesy of four-inch-tall risers\n- A handlebar-mounted analog-digital round instrument cluster\n- Single-seater setup that flows into a wide rear bobbed fender\n- LED lights all around with front turn signals mounted on the handlebar\n- Four vibrant color options—Biliary Gray, Vivid Black, Red Rock, and Sharkskin Blue.\nDimensions\nWheelbase |\n63.6 inches |\nLength |\n93.1 inches |\nGround Clearance |\n5.7 inches |\nRake |\n28 degrees |\nTrail |\n5.7 inches |\nSeat Height |\n27.9 inches |\nTop American Motorcycles With The Highest Torque Under $20,000\nHarley truly dominates the \"affordable\" big V-Twin torque game. Under $20,000, the Low Rider S shines with 125 pound-feet. Also under $15,000, it is the Harley-Davidson Softail Standard with 110 pound-feet. The Low Rider S is fiercely rivaled by the Indian Sport Chief, priced at $19,999. But it has a smaller V-twin, less power, less torque, and more weight. So, the Low Rider dominates and is more \"sporty\" on paper. Another Indian rival—the Chief Bobber Dark Horse—is there, and it shares the same powertrain as the Sport Chief but is heavier.\n[Related\n](/underrated-harley-davidson-motorcycles-in-2024/)\n[\n10 Underrated Harley-Davidson Motorcycles In 2024\n](/underrated-harley-davidson-motorcycles-in-2024/)\nThese Harley-Davidson bikes deserve more attention than they usually get\nWe have included another affordable Harley-Davidson big twin in this comparison to show how the next best affordable Harley stacks up in torque rating. The Street Bob 114 is technically a blacked-out Softail Standard. But it produces more torque at 119 pound-feet. This puts it at rank two on the list of torquiest Harley-Davidsons under $20,000. Interestingly, despite having a smaller engine, less power, and less torque, the Street Bob has a better power-to-weight ratio than the S.\nHarley-Davidson Low Rider S Vs Rivals\nModel |\nHarley-Davidson Low Rider S |\nIndian Sport Chief |\nIndian Chief Bobber Dark Horse |\nHarley-Davidson Street Bob 114 |\nPrice |\n$19,999 |\n$19,999 |\n$19,999 |\n$16,999 |\nEngine |\n1,917cc V-Twin; Air-Oil Cooled |\n1,890cc V-Twin; Air-Cooled |\n1,890cc V-Twin; Air-Cooled |\n1,868cc V-Twin; Air-Cooled |\nPower |\n103 HP |\n89 HP |\n89 HP |\n94 HP |\nTorque |\n125 LB-FT |\n120 LB-FT |\n120 LB-FT |\n119 LB-FT |\nCurb Weight |\n679 LBS. |\n685 LBS. |\n694 LBS. |\n655 LBS. |\nTop Speed |\n~115 MPH |\n~115 MPH |\n~115 MPH |\n~120 MPH |",
