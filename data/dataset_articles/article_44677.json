  "text": "$1M winning lottery ticket sold in Kendallville claimed 5 hours before deadline\nThe winner had until 4:30 p.m. ET Thursday to claim their prize\nKENDALLVILLE, Ind. (WPTA) - With five hours to spare, the couple who bought a $1 million winning lottery ticket in Kendallville claimed their prize.\nThe ticket, which matched all five white balls for the June 29 drawing, was bought at Kendallville Finish Line, at 620 Professional Way. The winning Powerball numbers for that drawing were: 26-51-54-61-69 with the Powerball of 25.\nUpon claiming the ticket, they said it was “an emotional day” for them both.\nThey told Hoosier lottery officials they had seen news coverage and signage about the unclaimed ticket beginning about a month ago and began searching. The couple said they do not visit the gas station frequently and were unsure if they had purchased a ticket for that specific Powerball drawing.\nThe first search was unsuccessful, but on Wednesday, they woke up at 4 a.m. to search again – including deep between their car seats. There, they found their winning ticket.\nAll prizes must be claimed within 180 days of the drawing. Hoosier Lottery encourages those with winning tickets to ensure their ticket is in a secure place, consider meeting with a financial advisor and contact Hoosier Lottery customer service at 1-800-955-6886 for specific claim instructions.\nThe Powerball jackpot is an estimated $145 million for Saturday, Dec. 28. Overall odds are 1 in 25, per Hoosier Lottery.\nWatch our [previous report](https://www.21alivenews.com/2024/12/07/1-million-winning-powerball-ticket-sold-kendallville-expire-soon/) below.\nTo be the first to get the latest breaking news alerts, download the 21Alive News App.\nDownload for both iPhone and Android devices can be found [here](https://www.21alivenews.com/page/get-the-new-abc-21-news-app-today/).\nCopyright 2024 WPTA.
