  "text": "JPMorgan Chase manages substantial wealth for high-net-worth individuals and sees an opportunity to expand its services for clients who prefer to manage portions of their investments independently.\nThe company has been enhancing its self-directed brokerage platform with new features and products, planning further rollouts in the coming year. These include a fresh fixed-income trading experience integrated into its mobile app.\nPaul Vienick, head of J.P. Morgan Online Investing, expresses confidence in the firm's potential. “I’m confident we can be a top five player in the space,” he says. The platform has shown impressive growth, with assets approaching $100 billion—an 80% increase over the past two years. Although this figure is still dwarfed by competitors like Charles Schwab and Fidelity, JPMorgan sees untapped potential within its vast base of banking and wealth management clients. Vienick envisions the platform managing $1 trillion in self-directed assets in the future. “Clearly, that will take time,” he acknowledges.\nAchieving such ambitious goals will demand considerable effort, but the industry trends are favorable. The self-directed investor segment is one of the fastest-growing areas within wealth management, fueled by the convenience of mobile apps and the rise of commission-free trading. The pandemic saw millions of Americans entering the stock market for the first time, with stock ownership climbing to 62% in 2023, the highest since 2008, according to Gallup.\nAnother notable trend is the increasing demand for hybrid solutions. Many investors want both self-directed accounts and access to professional financial advice. According to a survey by Broadridge Financial Solutions, one-third of self-directed investors also maintain an advisory relationship. JPMorgan aims to attract these clients, particularly those who hold self-directed assets with competitors like Schwab and Morgan Stanley’s E*Trade.\nJPMorgan’s wealth management division spans a range of services, including bank-based advisors catering to mass-affluent clients, a brokerage for wealthy individuals, a hybrid robo-advisor, and an extensive private bank. To strengthen its self-directed offering, the firm has been introducing features like fractional shares, trust accounts, and a streamlined user experience. Andrea Finan, head of self-directed investing, highlights the platform’s enhanced investment screening tools designed to help clients locate opportunities more efficiently.\nAnother recent addition is the J.P. Morgan Premium Deposit product, now available to self-directed investors. Historically exclusive to clients with financial advisors, this FDIC-insured high-yield savings account offers a 3.6% interest rate with a $50,000 minimum deposit.\nIn 2024, the firm plans to introduce fixed-income trading to its mobile app, complementing the existing capabilities on its website. This feature targets investors interested in fixed-income products, particularly given the current high-interest-rate environment. “We have people trading on the go, so mobile is a priority,” Finan says.\nAdditional enhancements under development include advanced options strategies and after-hours trading. These features align with moves by competitors, such as Schwab’s recent expansion of 24/5 trading for S&P 500 stocks, Nasdaq-100 shares, and select ETFs.\nJPMorgan’s self-directed brokerage platform, originally launched as You Invest six years ago, has evolved significantly. Following a rebranding, the platform has benefited from being developed in-house, ensuring a seamless and integrated user experience. “It’s one sign-on, one app,” Vienick notes.\nThrough these efforts, JPMorgan positions itself as a formidable player in the self-directed investing space, leveraging its existing client base, innovative technology, and a growing appetite for hybrid wealth management solutions.\nDecember 26, 2024",
