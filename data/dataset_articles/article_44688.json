  "text": "By Hannah Walker ,\n3 hours ago\nCARTHAGE, Texas ( KETK ) – Panola College has received a $279,280 Texas Reskilling and Upskilling through Education (TRUE) grant to advance four key health science programs.\nEast Texas non-profit presents $75,000 to Coop Reid of Troup The funding will help the college offer specialized training and develop Occupational Skills Awards in remote patient monitoring. The grant awarded by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board will benefit students and the community by providing essential skills and improving patient care in East Texas.\nPhoto courtesy of Panola College The grant will facilitate the placement of remote monitoring equipment into the homes of East Texas residents through a collaborative partnership with UT Health East Texas Home Health .\nThe four health science programs the grant will support includes Associated Degree Nursing, Health Information Technology, Medical Assisting and Occupational Therapy Assisting. The training will help students with the knowledge and skills needed to serve residents in the East Texas communities and addresses healthcare inequality caused by limited access to impartial care.\n“I am incredibly thankful for the interprofessional partnerships between our health science programs, UT Health East Texas Home Health, and the financial support from the TRUE grant award,” Julie Green, chair of the Occupational Therapy Assistant program said. “This program exemplifies the transformative power of collaboration, combining education with community connections to foster a healthier future for East Texas residents.”\nIn addition to students gaining valuable experience, they also will earn Occupational Skills Awards, which are recognized as stand-alone credentials and integrated into existing award programs. These credentials provide essential skills and address the growing demand for specialized healthcare professionals.\n“We are confident that this program will not only elevate the quality of care provided by its graduates but will also help to meet the growing demand for specialized healthcare professionals in our region,” Dr. Mike Little, joint venture president of UT Health East Texas Home Health said. “We also believe this will significantly contribute to addressing the skills gap and preparing a new generation of healthcare professionals.”\nFor more information about Panola College’s health science programs, visit https://www.panola.edu/healthsciences\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
