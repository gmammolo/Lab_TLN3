  "text": "HANOVER COUNTY, Va. — A missing Hanover County teenager has been found safe nearly a week after a CODI Alert was issued to help bring him home.\nPolice confirmed to CBS 6 that Mitchell Leahey was found safely on Thursday in Collier County, Florida.\nA CODI alert was issued by Virginia State Police last week after Mitchell ran away following a family therapy session.\nHis parents, Patrick and Katherine Leahey, said Mitchell left with only the clothes on his back and no personal belongings. CBS 6 spoke with them after they announced a $100,000 reward was being offered for Mitchell's safe return.\n\"The reward is what you’d give up for your kid; it’s everything,\" Patrick Leahey said. “That reward is so that anyone who might’ve thought it’s a good idea to just hold this kid with me would come forward and just say, ‘No, I’m going to take him to a hospital or call 911 and get him back home.’”\nPolice said Mitchell is in the process of being reunited with his family.\nThis is a developing story and CBS 6 is working to learn more.
