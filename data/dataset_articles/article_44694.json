  "text": "Taylor Swift recently missed the match between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Pittsburgh Steelers. As per reports, she does not attend away games due to security concerns. But now as per Page Six, a source close to the couple has revealed that Taylor might just be looking into making Nashville a temporary home. Currently, Taylor is not interested to live in Los Angeles or New York and would rather choose Nashville since it is closer to Kansas City.Taylor Swift Will Be Moving To Nashville Soon To Be Closer To Travis KelceTaylor currently owns a posh apartment and a mansion in Nashville. As per earlier reports, Taylor has also been looking into moving temporarily into the $6 million mansion that Travis Kelce owns in the Kansas City. Taylor actually wants to be there for her boyfriend, the NFL star and the tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce, as his team enters into the playoffs next month. As per reports, Taylor feels Travis will be more calm, comfortable and prepared if she decides to stay with him.— PageSix (@PageSix) For this reason, Travis has also recently spent thousands of dollars into securing this $6 million mansion of his since it was burglarised in the month of October. As per reports, Travis has solely done this for hid girlfriend, the global pop star, Taylor Swift so that she feels safe and comfortable living at his house.Taylor Swift Has A Lot Of Security ConcernsTaylor has been a bit scared when it comes to her safety lately. This might have stemmed from when her legendary Eras Tour had to be cancelled in Vienna in June 2024 as there was a terror threat. As per reports, it was earlier revealed that Taylor actually feels the safest only with her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. This is evident since in the last few months, apart from her Eras Tour, Taylor has rarely been spotted outside without her boyfriend beside her.It also looks like things are pretty serious between the global pop star and the NFL star. Not only has their romance inspired two Christmas Day movies this year but they are also spotted frequently hanging out with each other’s families. More than moving for safety in Nashville, one can assume Taylor is trying to be closer to Travis and his family since Kansas City is closer to Nashville than her current residence in New York.Taylor also is having the time of her life as she recently celebrated her star studded Eras-themed 35th birthday, As per reports, Travis surprised Taylor with this celebration when she thought she was going for a birthday dinner with Travis and her close friends. Pictures and videos from the party have gone viral that show Taylor and Travis enjoying the night together.Also Read: Former NFL star Antonio Brown sparks debate with harsh remarks about Travis Hunter's Heisman win and his fiancée",
