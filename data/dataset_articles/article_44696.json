  "text": "Teacher Nguyen Xuan Khang (first left) visits Nu Village (photo: Thuy Nga)\nThree months after officially adopting 22 children in Nu Village in Bao Yen district in Lao Cai province, all of whom had survived the devastating floods in September 2024, Khang decided to visit the \"grandchildren\" on the occasion of the inauguration of the new Nu Village.\nThe trip to Nu Village was the first time he had left Hanoi in six years. From Hanoi, he brought a box containing a 15-year promise to the grandchildren.\n\"This is a very special trip. These 22 grandchildren gave me the energy to weather difficulties and travel a long distance to get there,” he said.\n“I was welcomed with warmth from local people. Seeing the newly built school and houses excited and moved me,\" he said.\nNu Village, home of 37 households and 158 residents prior to the flood, was cleared after a severe flash flood in September. A huge amount of rocks and soil from Con Voi mountain with floodwaters flattened nearly all the houses there, and caused many deaths.\nThe government then gave instructions to revive Nu Village as soon as possible.\nThe first thing Khang did when arriving in Lao Cai was go to the old village to meet the children and local people. At the memorial house, Nguyen Thi Kim, mother of Ha Khanh Ngan, 3, one of the two youngest children that the teacher adopted, rushed to welcome him.\nShe was emotional and teary upon meeting teacher Khang in person. \"My daughter tells everyone that she has two grandfathers. She was eager to meet you. I don't know what to say, but I'm very touched seeing you coming and calling her name,\" she said to Khang.\nAfter that, Khang paid his respects at the memorial for flood victims and visited the new children’s homes. Though Khang had met them for the first time, he could recall all their names and remember their family conditions.\nWhen meeting Hoang Thi Hien, the grandmother of Hoang Xuan Phuc and Hoang Gia Bao, Khang said to her: “If you allow me to do this, I wish to care for them until they are 18.\" And Hien tearfully agreed: “Yes, thank you for supporting them.\"\nTeacher Khang and his 22 'grandchildren' (photo: Vo Thu) Making the trip, Khang brought his wish to meet all the 22 children he has adopted together with the children to ‘make a 15-year commitment’: the grandfather has to keep healthy, while the grandchildren have to study diligently.\nKhang recalled the moment when he heard about the disaster in Nu village and saw the image of Hoang Ngoc Lan at hospital. The 6-year-old girl had become orphaned after her parents and two elder brothers died.\n\"The images of Lan made me cry the most. I felt a bond with these children, and I wanted to be their grandfather, offering them support until they turn 18,\" Khang said.\nAlso, teacher Khang told them that he wanted to take a picture of him and the 22 children. Every year, on this day, he and the grandchildren will exchange photos to keep track of each other's health and growth.\nAfter exactly 15 years, on December 22, 2039, Khang, the grandfather, will be 90 years old, and the two youngest children – Gia Han and Khanh Ngan – will turn 18. All of them will meet each other in Hanoi and take a similar picture, like the picture they took when they first met in Nu Village.\nKhang went on to say that after meeting the children, he felt that he would live at least 15 more years to see the two youngest children grow up.\n“I don't know if fate will grant me life till 90, but I hope to stay healthy enough until then. If I have to depart earlier, my family and children will continue caring for them,\" he committed.\nBefore signing the pledge to \"stay healthy/study diligently,\" Khang promised that he will better take care of himself, eat more and sleep better, and work less to ensure a long life.\n“Being present in both photos will not be an easy thing, but I will try,” he promised.\nKhang and the children then signed and fingerprinted their commitment.\nThuy Nga",
