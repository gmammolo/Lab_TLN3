  "text": "UNICOI COUNTY, Tenn. — Anyone looking for a way to help the Unicoi County community recover from Hurricane Helene will have a chance over the weekend. Volunteer shifts are available on Dec. 28 for anyone able to spend some time cleaning up debris, removing tree limbs or shoveling mud in one of the East Tennessee areas hardest hit by the storm.\nShifts last 4 hours. One shift runs from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and the other goes from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. There are 10 slots available per shift, and anyone interested in helping can sign up online .\nThey were organized by RISE Erwin , a local nonprofit that seeks to uplift the community. Anyone who volunteers for the shifts can check in at the Volunteer Resource Center at 615 South Main Avenue in Erwin.\nVolunteers need to have their own transportation and should wear closed-toe shoes and work-friendly attire. They also should bring any protective equipment they may need, such as masks and work gloves. Volunteers can also bring any gear they think will be helpful, such as shovels or wheelbarrows.\nClose Ad",
