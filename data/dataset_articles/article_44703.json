Tommy Edman claims Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman, and Mookie Betts' leadership integral to Dodgers success Discuss Now Tommy Edman claims Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman, and Mookie Betts' leadership integral to Dodgers success Source: Getty The Los Angeles Dodgers started the 2024 season with the tag of being World Series favorites, and the NL West team lived up to the expectations. The Dodgers won their second title in four years after beating the New York Yankees in five games.\nSeveral players rose to the occasion for the Dodgers throughout the season and one name that surprised everyone with his performance was infielder Tommy Edman .\nThe 29-year-old, who was traded from the St. Louis Cardinals earlier this year, came clutch in the National League championship series against the New York Mets to help the Dodgers to the World Series.\n•\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now In conversation with \"Sports Spectrum,\" the NLCS MVP talked about the influence of MVP trio, Shohei Ohtani , Freddie Freeman and Mookie Betts . He said (20:30 onwards):\nTrending \"Shohei Ohtani is one of a kind, you know? And he had the best offensive season of all time, and that doesn't even include him pitching too. I think what's cool about him is he's so humble, you know, he has no ego whatsoever. Um, and he works really hard and comes in with the same exact attitude, always just like a happy guy.\" \"Always excited to see everybody. Um, I think that that's honestly, probably a big reason like having those guys Shohei, Freddie and Mookie. They're the same guys every day and I think having the leaders on your team who set that tone for the whole team, you know. It allows you to have success.\"\nTommy Edman's heroics in the second half of the season were rewarded as the Dodgers offered him a five-year, $74 million contract extension in November.\nShohei Ohtani will have a bigger role for the Dodgers next season Shohei Ohtani had a remarkable campaign in his first year with the Dodgers following a $700 million move last offseason. He even became the first MLB player to reach 50 home runs and 50 steals in a season.\nWhile Ohtani was a force to be reckonned with during the regular season, All-Star first baseman Freddie Freeman took over the mantle in the World Series against the Yankees. He was named the World Series MVP for his exploits.\nDodgers fans will be expecting more of the same from the star trio, especially Shohei Ohtani, who is slated to make a return to pitching sometime next year. The three-time MVP had a restricted role in 2024 due to his elbow surgery but will be part of the Dodgers rotation next season.\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?
