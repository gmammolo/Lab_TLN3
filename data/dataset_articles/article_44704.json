He stated that 24/7 passport issuance services would soon be available at NADRA mega centres in 14 cities, ensuring greater accessibility and convenience for the public. The Minister revealed that the long-standing backlog in passport processing has been completely eliminated. \"Citizens will now receive their passports on time,\" he assured, adding that previously, delays of up to six months were common.\nThe inauguration ceremony also highlighted the Minister's vision for improved service delivery.\nNaqvi toured the new reception area, online services section, production centre, and data centre, praising the upgraded facilities. He presented shields and cash prizes to staff members who had shown exceptional performance in passport production.\nThe Minister also announced plans to establish model passport centres in Karachi and Lahore, further expanding the availability of top-tier services across the country.
