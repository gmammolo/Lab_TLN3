Message volumes increased to ‘extremely high’ zone.\nIn November, its board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share, payable on December 4, 2024, to its shareholders of record as of November 18, 2024.\nFor its third quarter, the firm reported net income of $73.7 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $146.3 million, or $2.28 loss per share, for the third quarter of 2023.\nKemper provides specialized insurance services, including life and health insurance, operating through its specialty property and casualty insurance and life insurance segments. With approximately $13 billion in assets, its Kemper Auto and Kemper Life brands, serve over 4.8 million policies, represented by 22,200 agents and brokers, and 7,500 associates.\nKemper stock is up 32% year-to-date.\nFor updates and corrections, email newsroom[at]stocktwits[dot]com.<\nFor more reliable and latest news subscribe to Asianet Newsable WhatsApp channel by clicking here.
