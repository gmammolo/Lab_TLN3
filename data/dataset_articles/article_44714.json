  "text": "Mumbai: Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority (JNPA) has announced the launch of an electrical ferry boat from JNPA to Mumbai and will start operation next month. The aim is to bring a zero-emission environment-friendly ferry boat for the public.\nOperating from the Gateway of India to JNPA in the sea, and from the Bhaucha Dhakka to JNPA during the foul season, these boats promise to make commuting more convenient and hassle-free for travellers.\nThe boat will significantly shorten the journey from Mumbai to Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNP), by 20 minutes which makes a total journey of 30-40 minutes. The new boat also prioritizes passage comfort with air-conditioned seating arrangements, improving the travel experience.\nThe pollution-free and environment-friendly boat, backed by Harit Sagar or the “Green Port” initiative, focuses on sustainable port operations and reducing the environmental impact launched by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPS&W). It aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2047 and enhance renewable energy usage by 60% across major ports, JNPA said in a statement.\nThese fast and efficient ferry boats can comfortably accommodate 20-24 passengers at a time, offering a seamless travelling experience with an easy online ticketing system and check-in options while the tickets will continue to be issued by JNPA.",
