  "text": "By Paloma Chavez ,\n1 hours ago\nA 78-year-old man went missing after going to get the mail, California officials said.\nThen a drone spotted his motionless body in thick brush, according to a Dec. 23 Facebook post by Malibu Search and Rescue .\nThe man, who has early onset dementia, left his home Dec. 23 at 4:30 p.m. to get the mail but never returned, officials said.\nA few hours later, rescuers got a call that their help was needed as the temperature was falling from 48 degrees, officials said.\nThe Lost Hills Sheriff’s Office deployed drones equipped with infrared heat-seeking tech, and slightly past 11 p.m. rescuers found a “significant heat signature” near the roadway, officials said.\nRescuers went to the location and found the man confused, unable to walk and suffering from cold-related illness, officials said.\nA blanket was wrapped around him, and he was placed in a rescue basket, officials said.\nHe was then carried to an ambulance and taken to the hospital for treatment, officials said.\nMalibu is about a 30-mile drive west of downtown Los Angeles.\n‘Santa’ gets stuck 60 feet up on side of building and needs rescue, CT firefighters say\nVisually impaired man rescued after he couldn’t see trail markers, Oregon cops say\nHelicopter spots missing hunter climbing mountain to call for help, Nevada cops say",
