My case manager first told me of the changes a couple of weeks ago as he dropped a bomb – he’s leaving the Coalition. He has taken a job with the courts. He had been my case manager for more than four years – the only case manager I’ve ever had. A few weeks before, my nurse told me she was leaving the Coalition to further her education. She said the Coalition is moving away from the “team” concept and her position had been eliminated. Both she and my case manager were offered positions in the shakeup that they decided not to accept. The assistant property manager also quit last week.
