ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — Cornerback Riley Moss is set to make his return to game action.\nThe second-year cornerback was a full participant in practice for the third consecutive day, and he was not assigned a game status for Saturday's game against the Bengals.\n\"He'll be ready to go,\" Head Coach Sean Payton said Thursday.\nThe absence of a game status indicates a player is expected to be available for the upcoming game.\nMoss has not played since suffering a knee injury in Week 12 against the Raiders.\nRunning back Jaleel McLaughlin (quad) and wide receiver Troy Franklin (ankle) were also listed as full participants and not assigned game statuses.\nRunning back Tyler Badie, who was designated for return from injured reserve this week, is listed as questionable with a back injury. He was a full participant in all three practices this week, but Denver would need to activate him to the 53-man roster for him to play vs. Cincinnati.\nThe Broncos will face the Bengals at 2:30 p.m. MT on NFL Network on Saturday.\nRelated Content",
