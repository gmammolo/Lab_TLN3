  "text": "Nebraska Governor’s second surgery a success following horse riding accident\nPillen will remain in hospital for ‘several more days,’ his team says\nOMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - Gov. Jim Pillen spent Christmas in the hospital, as Nebraska Medicine doctors finished up another surgery overnight after he was bucked off a horse.\nIt’s hard to say if the governor will remain in the hospital into the new year. [Pillen was hospitalized](https://www.1011now.com/2024/12/23/governor-transported-unmc-following-fall-horse/) after getting bucked off a new horse he was breaking in Sunday on a ride with his daughter, his son-in-law, and his granddaughter on family land near Columbus.\nThe governor’s [trauma doctors](https://www.wowt.com/2024/12/23/doctors-give-update-gov-pillens-condition-after-accident/) said he wanted to go home the next night, that he was already walking the halls working to recover, but they cautioned that the big uncertainty was whether or not his breathing would be impacted by his seven broken ribs. Pillen, who is 68, opted to get surgery to help that.\nThen on [Wednesday night](https://www.wowt.com/2024/12/25/gov-pillen-undergoes-procedure-christmas-day-after-horse-riding-accident/), Pillen received what’s known as “rib fixation” — a four-hour procedure in which surgeons stabilize broken ribs with metal plates, with the goal of easing pain, promoting stronger long-term healing, and limiting future complications.\nAround 2 a.m. Thursday, the governor’s team sent First Alert 6 a statement calling the second surgery a success, and included that there have been no new issues with Pillen’s bruised kidney, punctured lung or damaged spleen suffered in the accident.\nThe statement also said that Gov. Pillen will remain in the hospital for “several more days” as he continues to recover so the doctors can watch for any surprises.\n—\nGet a first alert on breaking news delivered to your inbox.
