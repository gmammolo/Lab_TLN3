  "text": "Yoruba, Hausa, Ndigbo leaders celebrate peace in Delta community 26th December 2024 By Dele Ogunyemi Kindly share this story:\nLeaders of the Yoruba, Hausa and Ndigbo communities in Delta State have thanked the traditional ruler of Uwvie Kingdom, Emmanuel Abe I, noting that the king and his subjects have made their stay in the community worthwhile.\nThey bared their minds on Thursday at a civic reception commemorating this year’s Uwvie Day celebration held at the courtyard of the palace in Uwvie.\nIn his address at the occasion, the Leader of Egbe Omo Yoruba Ni Uvwie, Chief Salami Olaniyi, stated that “Uvwie is a very peaceful place to stay in and do business.”\nHe called on investors who left the town before now to return and reinvest in the kingdom.\nOlaniyi added, “We are here to display our culture because Nigeria is one. Yorubas have their culture, Hausas have their culture, Urhobos have their culture. So, we are here to display our culture. That’s why we are here to celebrate with our hosts on this auspicious occasion of the Uvwie Day.”\nHe urged Yorubas in the community to continue to live in peace and harmony with their host Uvwie people and not get themselves involved in any form of violence or criminal activities such as drug peddling and addiction, among others.\nAccording to him, they should always strive to “Display the peaceful nature and characteristics for which the Yorubas are known”, as they cohabitate with their Uvwie brothers and sisters in the Kingdom.\nSpeaking in the same vein, the President-General of Ndigbo, Delta Central and South, Chief Aminu Joel, noted that “Since the ascension on the throne of His Majesty Sideso Abe I, as the Ovie (King) of Uvwie Kingdom, illegal revenue collection, otherwise known as ‘Deve’ no longer exists in the land”. Related News\nConsequently, he assured Nigerians, particularly businessmen and investors, to “Come and build, develop properties and invest in Uvwie Kingdom.”\nWhile reiterating that the Uvwie people are very accommodating and hospitable, Joel stated, “People should not look at the Uvwie Kingdom as a land of crisis.\n“Uvwie is a land of milk and honey and it’s a land of peace. There’s no crisis. No more ‘Deve’ and Uwvie people receive strangers.\n“The Igbo people resident in Uvwie are living in peace with their host Uvwie people just like their Hausa, Yoruba, Esan counterparts do. Uvwie is also safe for business.”\nIn his address, the Leader of the Arewa Community in Uvwie Kingdom, Alhaji Sulaiman Jauro, represented by Muhammad Umar, described Uvwie as “the most peaceful Local Government Area in the whole of Delta State. Delta State is the most peaceful State in Nigeria. The people of Uvwie Kingdom accommodate strangers a lot. They are also very hospitable.\n“We stay in peace, harmony and unity in Uvwie with their people. Nowhere you can take your business to, sell it and make a profit like in Uvwie. Once you can follow their rules and regulations, the time for revenue you pay, nobody will disturb you in Uvwie as they are accommodating.”\nJauro enjoined the Arewa people to always obey the rules and regulations of the Uvwie Kingdom and continue to live in peace with their hosts.\nHe also appealed to the people of Uvwie Kingdom, especially the leadership, to always be patient with the Arewa people to continue to accommodate them so they can all enjoy the existing peace together.
