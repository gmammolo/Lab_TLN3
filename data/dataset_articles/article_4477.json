  "text": "The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) has taken a significant step toward strengthening justice delivery in Kisumu City with the posting of a resident prosecutor to the newly established Kisumu City Law Court.\nNyanza Regional Coordinator, Mr. Daniel Karuri, announced the deployment during a courtesy call to the court earlier today. He emphasized the importance of speedy resolution of cases involving violations of city by-laws, noting that the move reflects the judiciary’s commitment to upholding law and order while ensuring justice is served without delay.\n“The posting of a resident prosecutor demonstrates our dedication to maintaining law and order in Kisumu City and ensuring that justice is dispensed swiftly,” Mr. Karuri said.\nWith the prosecutor now in place, the Kisumu City Law Court is expected to operate at full capacity. Already, clerks and the city inspectorate team have processed eight case files, with summons issued to accused persons to appear before the court immediately.\nMr. Karuri expressed optimism that Kisumu’s city-related cases will be heard and determined in record time, easing the backlog and reinforcing accountability for those flouting municipal regulations.\nThe Regional Coordinator was warmly received at the court by Tabitha Oduor, Head of the City’s Legal Department, and Samwel Orimba, Deputy Head of the City Inspectorate. Both officials welcomed the development, terming it a milestone in the city’s pursuit of efficient justice and orderly urban management.",
