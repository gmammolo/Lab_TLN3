  "text": "Welcome to the Thunderdome. Oh, wait. That’s next year.\nThe Acorn All-Star football awards show continues—including anointing the Player of the Year—and we’ll put a bow on the season with the final, the definitive, the official Acorn Power Poll.\nIt’s go time.\nCHAMPIONS FOR CHARACTER\nJackson Taylor\nAlan Ko\nThe Thousand Oaks High students earned CIF-Southern Section Dr. Jim Staunton Champions for Character awards.\nTaylor is a junior quarterback for the CIF semifinalist football team, Acorn All- Star and blue-chip college prospect. Ko, an Acorn All-Star and digital editor for the Lancer student newspaper, is the first high school student journalist to win the Champions for Character media award.\nTHE LONDON (TOP RECEIVER)\nCooper Cronquist\nMoorpark senior wide receiver set school records with 159 career catches, 2,313 receiving yards in a career, and 254 receiving yards in one game against Oxnard on Oct. 18. Keep in mind, Moorpark is the same school that produced NFL receivers Drake London and Chad Hansen. Impressive.\nINTERVIEW TEAM MVP\nNico Mastrippolito\nNeed a good quote? Oak Park senior wide receiver Nico Mastrippolito is the man. He is honest, articulate, smart, thoughtful and funny, and I always learn something new during our conversations.\nIf award-winning broadcaster Chris Myers (who lives in the area) interviewed Mastrippolito, that would be TV gold. Mastrippolito, a contender for top receiver, finished with 62 receptions for 1,101 yards and 13 touchdowns, and he added 16 tackles and two interceptions on defense.\nCOMEBACK PLAYER OF THE YEAR\nTagg Harrison\nHarrison threw zero touchdown passes for Westlake last season.\nThis year, his first in a Simi Valley uniform, he had 2,835 passing yards and 22 touchdown strikes with five rushing scores. He led the Pioneers to a CIF championship game and a school-record 12 wins.\nHarrison is humble, hardworking, smart, talented and resilient. He got knocked down—but he got up, dusted the dirt off his shoulder pads and went to work on the best comeback of 2024.\nROOKIE OF THE YEAR\nMicah Hannah\nSimi Valley freshman cornerback started for the CIF finalists. Hannah finished with 57 tackles, 16 pass deflections, one interception and one receiving touchdown. The 4.0 GPA student, the son of former NFL wide receiver Travis Hannah of the Houston Oilers, has college offers from the Arizona Wildcats and Texas A&M Aggies.\nTHE OCTOBOSS\nSam Kijner, Calabasas\nKijner is a bad man. And that’s a good thing. Calabasas senior linebacker led Coyotes with 93 tackles in award named after the guy who rides a flying motorcycle in “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.”\nTHE DANGERBIRD (TOP DEFENSIVE LINEMAN)\nIsaac Thomas\nOak Park senior defensive lineman scored one of the biggest defensive touchdowns in school history in a memorable playoff win against Camarillo. Thomas, one of the best two-way linemen in program history, led Dangerbird Defense with 120 tackles and 12 sacks.\nSNOT OTTER MVP\nGeorge Hastings\nSome background: The Snot Otter is my nickname. I figure, if Kobe Bryant can give himself a goofy nickname like Black Mamba, I can, too.\nHastings, an Agoura sophomore, makes plays everywhere at quarterback, linebacker, running back, safety and tight end. He led the Chargers with 130 tackles, two interceptions, two forced fumbles and one blocked punt, and he scored seven touchdowns.\nThe 4.2 GPA scholar athlete also plays baseball—but he is the area’s most versatile football player.\nGREEN HELMET / GREEN MONSTER AWARD\nCory McEnroe\nThousand Oaks senior linebacker/human sledgehammer led all Acorn country players with 172 tackles this season.\nMcEnroe played a pivotal role along the offensive line as a blocking tight end for Acorn All-Star running back Justin Lewis, who gleaned 1,306 yards and 15 touchdowns on the ground. McEnroe added 13 receptions for 172 yards and five total touchdowns for the Lancers, who reached the CIF playoff semifinals for the second straight year.\nMcEnroe is one of the best defensive players in Thousand Oaks history. He reminds me of Denver Broncos linebacker Alex Singleton, a Walter Payton Man of the Year nominee and a T.O. legend.\nMOST IMPROVED PLAYER\nTillman Lovett\nOak Park senior quarterback was thrown into the fire in his first varsity start last year, the Kanan Bowl against Agoura, and he struggled.\nHe bounced back, big time.\nThe Eagle, the son of Los Angeles Rams director of strength and conditioning Justin Lovett, is the Most Improved Player of the Year. Tillman Lovett threw for 2,474 yards and 31 touchdowns while leading the Dangerbirds to the CIF playoff quarterfinals. Outside the Snot Otter’s Fortress of Verisimilitude, Lovett was under the proverbial radar all year.\nOFFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR\nEthan LaSecla\nThe senior quarterback put up Tecmo Bowl numbers for Grace of Simi Valley, the Citrus Coast League champion.\nLaSecla, a 3.98 GPA student, nearly had a 2,000-2,000 season: He had 2,253 yards and 23 touchdowns in the air, and he added 1,853 yards and 30 touchdowns on the ground. He has also played lacrosse, soccer and baseball at Grace.\nThe Lancer’s domination after starting high school in 8-man football is an extraordinary feat.\nDEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR\nDrew Cofield\nCofield, a senior cornerback/receiver, made the biggest defensive play in the biggest game of the season for Newbury Park in the CIF-Southern Section Division 2 championship at Murrieta Valley. Cofield’s forced fumble at the goal-line was the play of the year, and it was the catalyst in a 31-28 win for the Panthers’ first section title since 1993.\nThe scholar athlete and UC Davis commit finished with 53 tackles and one interception, but Cofield’s impact goes beyond stats for the Black Cat Attack, the best defensive unit in the area.\nBetween Cofield, Christian Knoos of Oaks Christian (Linebacker of the Year), and Cory McEnroe of Thousand Oaks (Green Helmet/Green Monster Award), UC Davis snared the three best defensive players in Ventura County.\nCOACH OF THE YEAR\nJoe Smigiel\nThe Panthers have talent, of course, but they don’t win a ring without Smigiel and his staff dialing up winning plays.\nIt wasn’t easy. The third-year head coach purged the roster of malcontents in his first training camp. In 2023, the defense was a work in progress and the offense stalled periodically, but the Black Cat Attack still reached a section final. The Panthers put it all together this season.\nI tip my Seattle SuperSonics hat to Smigiel, the Coach of the Year.\nACORN NEWSPAPERS PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n& WAYNE COOK QUARTERBACK OF THE YEAR\nBrady Smigiel\nSmigiel is a generational football player who has changed the sports landscape in Acorn country. That is not hyperbole.\nThe Newbury Park junior quarterback broke every significant county passing record last year, and he evolved into an even better player this season. The son of the Coach of the Year dialed up 3,521 passing yards with 49 touchdowns and only three interceptions. The future NFL player added 435 rushing yards and a team-high 11 scores on the ground. Brady Smigiel, a five-star field general with a big arm and a bigger brain, propelled the Panthers to their first CIF title in 31 years.\nTeammate Shane “The Unicorn” Rosenthal earned Acorn Newspapers Player of the Year last fall. Smigiel wears the crown now, too.\nSay it loud: Brady Smigiel is the best quarterback in Ventura County history. He has absolutely nothing left to prove in high school.\nTEAM OF THE YEAR\nNEWBURY PARK PANTHERS\nThe show goes on.\nACORN ALL-STARS\nAgoura\n• George Hastings (Acorn Team MVP)\n• Brady Dieffenbach\n• Tyler Starling\n• Connor Luebke\n• Giacomo “Sonic the Hedgehog” Likavec\n• Luke Ambrosio\n• Garrett Leninger\n• Dominic Montagna\n• Jake Mercer\n• DC Stevenson\n• Nathan Conmy\n• Garrett Andrews\n• Will Gelt\n• William Navarez\n• Reggie Zuckerman\n• Finn Ward\n• Luke Bussiere\n• Colton Powell\n• Evan Yang\n• Reid Chute\n• Miles Garrett\nCalabasas\n• Kayne Miller (Acorn Team MVP)\n• Anthony Simon\n• Sam “The Octoboss” Kijner\n• Max Avshalomov\n• Dom Hardy\n• Dezmyn Hardy\n• Simon Lazarovits\n• Kingston Celifie\n• Stephen Ouvaroff\n• Dylan Hein\n• Jeremiah “JJ” Smith\n• Tanner Magbanua\n• Jiovanni Andrade\n• Ben Chacham\n• Ian Linka\n• Ben Hever\nOak Park\n• Isaac Thomas (Acorn Team MVP)\n• Oliver “All-American” Gonzalez\n• Nico Mastrippolito\n• Tillman Lovett\n• Ethan Abergel\n• Zach Abergel\n• Desmond Sweeney\n• Dylan Bruns\n• Bridger Weir\n• Tyler Kang\n• Tyler Fuchs\n• Taylor Cruz\n• Luke O’Shaughnessy\nWestlake\n• Demanie Bell (Acorn Team MVP)\n• Mason Charles\n• Jhonas Pinkard\n• Jalen Green\n• Jayson Brattin\n• Charles Davis “The Third”\n• Julian Ramirez\n• Vincent Carner\n• Marcus Rojas\n• Gabriel Goroyan\n• Caden Atkinson\nOaks Christian\n• Christian Knoos (Acorn Team MVP)\n• Stevie Amar Jr.\n• Hayden Lowe\n• Davon Benjamin\n• Trey Towns Jr.\n• Matt Watts\n• Joseph Peko\n• Easton Thompson\n• Jamarey Smith\n• Lucas Hillsten\n• Ben Hatfield\n• Noah LaBerge\n• Sonny Jones\n• Andrew Powell\n• Logan Panthier\n• Bryan Granger-Narcisse\n• Chase Moss\n• Colby Simpson\n• Michael Hare\nSNOT OTTER ALL-STARS*\n• Gavin Gray, Agoura\n• Lawson Grace, Westlake\n• Axel Eason, Oaks Christian\n• Evan Fanner, Oaks Christian\n• Weston Schwesinger, Oaks Christian\n*Players who endured injuries/time off field but still deserve Acorn All-Star nods\nFINAL ACORN POWER POLL\n1.
