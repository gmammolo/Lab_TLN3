  "text": "By Priscilla Nimako\nAfienya, Dec. 26, GNA-The Reverend Dr. Johnnie Titus Kuzagbe, the lead pastor of the Rhema Basilica Assemblies of God, has called on Christians to present Jesus Christ as the only saviour of a sinful world.\nHe said Jesus should also be seen as a symbol of salvation to the world.\nRev. Dr. Kuzagbe said it is because of Jesus Christ that is why the world celebrate Christmas, an annual festival commemorating his birth.\nHe said Christians believe Jesus Christ is the son of God and salvation to life, and so the world should accept him and receive eternal life.\n“Christ is humanity’s saviour and the world’s light, who brought hope to gentiles in darkness,” he reiterated.\nQuoting scriptures, Rev. Dr. Kuzagbe said Christ’s birth bridges the gap between God and humans, adding that through it, all humans became family irrespective of their race and ethnicity to share in love.\nHe said families should use Christmas to preserve and pass on Christian traditions, customs, and values to future generations.\nChristmas offers an opportunity for personal reflection, self-improvement, and renewal, as individuals look at the past and set goals for the new year, he added.\nGNA",
