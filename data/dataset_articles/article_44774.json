  "text": "If you are looking for a landed home nestled in the embrace of nature, yet an arm’s reach away from urban conveniences, check out Pavonia, a newly launched development in Bukit Bandaraya, Shah Alam in Selangor.\nBuilt by award-winning developer Worldwide Property, the property arm of Worldwide Holdings Bhd, Pavonia intertwines modern living with the nostalgic charm of a tropical landscape spanning 8.2 acres. This exclusive low-density leasehold development whispers of a simpler time when families found solace in quiet neighbourhoods surrounded by nature. With only 15 homes per acre and a total of 126 carefully crafted double-storey terraces, Pavonia spells space, tranquility and sustainability.\nThis premier development not only balances the serenity of nature with contemporary design, but also facilitates the core pillars of interactivity, dynamism, family, community engagement and innovation.\nFlexible layouts for evolving needs\nThe seasoned developer understands that a home should evolve with its inhabitants. That’s why Pavonia is conceptualised as an open layout. Its minimalist design allows flexibility and efficient customisation to cater to the growing and changing needs of your family. Want a cosy reading nook today but envision a home office tomorrow? Its convertible living spaces make it easy for you to maximise space without compromising comfort or style. You will discover the freedom of versatile living—perfect for the dynamic lifestyle most families lead today.\nThe modern architectural facade design is complemented by large windows that fill your spacious home with natural light and ventilation. Whether it's the soothing sounds of nature from your backyard or the visual pleasure from the aesthetic interiors, Pavonia is all about crafting an emotional connection between you and your living environment to create a sensory experience that not only pleases your eyes but also calms your souls.\nCatering to varying family sizes and needs, Pavonia offers intermediate units starting from 1,867 sq ft, end-lots at 1,941 sq ft and expansive corner lots at 2,115 sq ft. All units come with four bedrooms and four bathrooms.\nClose to everything, yet far from ordinary\nSituated in the established township of Bukit Bandaraya, Pavonia is close to all the essential amenities for an urban lifestyle.\nFamilies will appreciate the convenience of nearby educational institutions, including Universiti Teknologi MARA and Management & Science University (MSU). Healthcare is just around the corner with facilities such as Shah Alam Hospital and Avisena Specialist Hospital. Meanwhile shopping and entertainment are also within easy reach, with hubs like Setia City Mall, i-City and AEON Shah Alam.\nIf you love the outdoors, you'll find recreational spaces like the Shah Alam National Botanical Park right at your doorstep, ensuring a lifestyle that balances work with play and relaxation.\nWithin a car ride away via major highways like the New Klang Valley Expressway (NKVE), you can enjoy more vibrant city offerings at Klang, Setia Alam, Subang Jaya, Petaling Jaya and Kuala Lumpur.\nBack to good old days of open spaces and community building\nLiving in Pavonia means waking up to the quiet sounds of nature, reminiscing about childhood days spent playing in the open air, and knowing your children will have those same opportunities. It’s a place where the architecture complements the landscape.\nWith every detail curated for quality, comfort and harmony, the developer is building not just walls and roofs, but a neighbourhood where families can thrive and grow within the embrace of community bonds.\nAdditionally, this is a home that prioritises sustainability, using green label-certified products and eco-friendly materials with low emissions. This commitment to responsible resource use and energy efficiency not only promotes a healthier living environment but aligns with global sustainability goals, making it a smart investment for the future.\nReturning to the essence of home\nIn short, Pavonia is more than a modern residential development; it is a return to the essence of home. Its harmonious blend of space, modernity and nature is perfect for families looking to write their next chapter.\nFor more insights, visit its sales gallery or contact 03–9212 0416 to schedule your personalised tour.
