  "text": "Even after thousands of years, the power of the roman empire continues to fascinate people. With some even going as far as to recreate it on film.\nThere have been countless movies loosely reiterating epic moments in history – but none have compared to that of Russell Crowe’s , Gladiator .\n(Image: Paramount) The 2000s Oscar-winning movie, directed by Ridley Scott, follows the downfall of Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius who was betrayed by Commodus, the ambitious son of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius.\nMaximus once asked: “Are you not entertained?”\nAnd it is clear audiences are still entertained 24 years later as a second instalment arrives later in 2024. With anticipation building for Gladiator II , we’ve done a deep dive to answer all your burning questions – including where you can watch the first film in Australia.\nWhat is the plot for Gladiator II? The second instalment of Gladiator will take place more than 20 years after the original movie. It is expected to follow a now-grown Lucius, the son of Lucilla, as he takes on Maximus’ legacy.\nPaul Mescal takes on the role of Lucius. (Credit: Paramount) It has been reported Lucius will be fighting in the ring as his political ties haunt him. It was his birthright to ascend as a Caesar but decided to carry on Maximus’ legacy following his brave sacrifice.\nAs of yet, nothing has been set in stone regarding the plot for Gladiator II . The trailer for the second movie debuted at CinemaCon in mid-April, but it has yet to be revealed to an international audience.\nWho is the cast for Gladiator? Australian’s own Russell Crowe starred as Maximus in the first rendition of Gladiator . However, given the characters tragic end, he will not be returning.\nThe cast members returning however for the second film include Connie Nielsen, Spencer Treat Clarke, Dijmon Hounsou and May Calamawy.\nTaking up the lead as Lucius is Hollywood favourite Paul Mescal. Joining him his Denzel Washington, Pedro Pascal, Barry Keoghan and Joseph Quinn.\nPedro Pascal joins the cast for Gladiator II. (Credit: Paramount) Is Gladiator based on a true story? Ridley Scott’s Gladiator is loosely based on real events in ancient Rome. The film is accurate is some areas, it predominately took inspiration from the time.\nMaximus Decimus Meridius was not a real person but was inspired by the Roman general Marcus Nonius Macrinus – a general, statesman and advisor during Marcus Aurelius’ reign from 161 to 180AD. The character was also believed to be inspired by Cincinnatus, Marcus Nonius Macrunis, Lucius Annaeus Seneca, Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus.\nAs for Commodus, son to Marcus Aurelius, he wasn’t a fair ruler, his lust for power was dramatised. He did however ascend the throne for a decade following his father’s death.\nWhere to watch Gladiator II online in Australia You can now buy or rent Gladiator II online in Australia on the following streaming platforms:\nApple TV Prime Video YouTube You can also purchase a DVD from a retailer such as Amazon .\nIf you want to watch the original Gladiator movie, it’s available to stream:\nStream Gladiator on BINGE from $10/mth, with a 7-day free trial.
