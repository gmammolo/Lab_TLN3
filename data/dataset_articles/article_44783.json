  "text": "Incidents in Bangladesh, Pakistan remind us of sacrifices by Sikh gurus: Yogi Adityanath\nThe event to mark the Veer Bal Diwas saw the commencement of 11,000 Sahaj Paaths.\n[Express News Service](/agency/express-news-service/)Lucknow | Updated: December 27, 2024 04:07 IST\nTaking part in a ceremony to mark Veer Bal Diwas (Sahibzada Diwas) at his official residence in Lucknow, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday said that recent incidents taking place in the neighbouring countries, Bangladesh and Pakistan, reminded about the sacrifices of the Sikh Gurus.\n“The Sikh community has a glorious history, yet we hear that only a handful of Sikh families remain in Kabul. Incidents in Bangladesh and atrocities in Pakistan remind us of the sacrifices of the Sikh Gurus… The ideals of the Sikh Gurus provide us with the energy to move forward. Their blessings serve as our inspiration. By carrying forward their legacy, we can prevent situations like those in Kabul and Bangladesh. Places like Nankana Sahib will come to us naturally, without the need for agitation or struggle,” he said.\nThe event to mark the Veer Bal Diwas saw the commencement of 11,000 Sahaj Paaths.\n“Today, this event has grown into a national observance. On this day, two Sahibzaades of Guru Gobind Singh—Baba Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh—were walled up alive by Wazir Khan.”\nRecounting the sacrifices made during the Battle of Chamkaur, where Guru Gobind Singh’s sons, Baba Ajit Singh and Baba Jujhar Singh, attained martyrdom, Adityanath said: “Guru Nanak Dev was the first to stand against Babar’s atrocities. Guru Arjun Dev’s martyrdom in Lahore was to protect India from Jahangir’s tyranny. Guru Teg Bahadur sacrificed his life but upheld India’s honor, ensuring that Kashmir remained an integral part of India. Guru Gobind Singh Ji Maharaj witnessed the ultimate sacrifice of his sons and father for the nation.”\nThe Chief Minister emphasized that the history of Sikh Gurus, from Guru Nanak Dev to Guru Gobind Singh Maharaj, the four Sahibzaades, and the Panch Pyaras, is a testament to their martyrdom for the country and religion. “This history is not just of the Sikh community, but of the entire nation, serving as a profound inspiration for all Indians,” he stated.\nRecalling the historical significance of [Lucknow](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/lucknow/), he said, “Lucknow is fortunate that Guru Teg Bahadur ji had come here with Guru Gobind Singh. To honor this heritage, a comprehensive plan for the beautification of associated Gurudwaras should be prepared in collaboration with the Municipal Corporation.”\nHe assured financial support from the state government and urged coordinated efforts.\nYou want to be the smartest in the room.\nYou want access to our award-winning journalism.\nYou don’t want to be misled and misinformed.",
