  "text": "By Jeff Bobo Editor ,\n2 hours ago\nProject Serve Our Soldiers recently honored a volunteer who is passionate about serving active duty service men and women from Hawkins County.\nPSOS founder Corki Weart honored Hayden Fugate on Dec. 10 as the 2024 Volunteer of the Year during a celebration at the Hale Springs Inn to thank donors and volunteers.\nProject Serve Our Soldiers raises money and supplies to make sure local soldiers have snacks and basic supplies like socks and toiletries while they are on deployment.\nTo meet the demand requires a lot of effort, whether it be organizing and staffing fundraisers, or preparing care packages to be sent overseas. This past year PSOS kicked its program into overdrive in anticipation of major deployments from Tennessee National Guard Armories in Rogersville and Mount Carmel.\nWeart said Hayden made personal sacrifices to ensure that he was available to lend a hand at all PSOS events.\n“Hayden has been our most faithful volunteer we’ve ever had,” Weart said. “He’s young, and we need more young people like him to support what we do. He loves Project Serve Our Soldiers, and it’s one of his passions. I don’t know who’s more passionate about our soldiers, whether it’s me or him. We kind of battle for that honor sometimes.”\nFugate was presented with a plaque that reads, “2024 PSOS Volunteer of the Year. Project Serve Our Soldiers presents to Hayden James Fugate, awarded in appreciation of your invaluable volunteer services, contributions, and urgent deployment response to Project Serve Our Soldiers and all those we serve and Support.”\nAnyone interested in making a financial contribution can mail it to: Project Serve Our Soldiers, 183 Manis Road, Rogersville, TN 37857.\nFor more information about volunteering or making a donation call Corki Weart at (407) 883-2036, or email: projectserveoursoldiers@gmail.com",
