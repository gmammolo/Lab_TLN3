  "text": "HC orders ASI and state govt to protect 17th century Agra monument ‘from getting razed’\nThe court was hearing a PIL filed by one, Chandrapal Singh Rana, who sought the protection of the heritage building, Hammam of Ali Vardi Khan located in Chipitola in Agra, from the imminent danger of being demolished by “illegal and unauthorised persons”.\n[Neetika Jha](https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/neetika-jha/)Noida | December 27, 2024 04:01 IST\nThe Allahabad High Court on Thursday granted interim protection to a Hammam, a 17th-century heritage site located in Agra, and directed the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and other state authorities to ensure that no damage is done to the monument.\nThe court was hearing a PIL filed by one, Chandrapal Singh Rana, who sought the protection of the heritage building, Hammam of Ali Vardi Khan located in Chipitola in Agra, from the imminent danger of being demolished by “illegal and unauthorised persons”.\n“…considering the facts as disclosed in the petition and the circumstances of the case, the Commissioner of Police, Agra, [Uttar Pradesh](https://indianexpress.com/article/when-is/uttar-pradesh-lok-sabha-elections-schedule-phase-seats-candidates-results-and-all-you-need-to-know-about-uttar-pradesh-general-elections-2024-9160791/) as well as the Archaeological Survey of India, Agra Circle, 22 The Mall, Agra, U.P and the Director of Uttar Pradesh State Archeology Chhatar Manzil Campus, M.G. Road, Kaiserbagh, [Lucknow](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/lucknow/) shall ensure that no damage is done to the building/monument. The Commissioner of Police, Agra shall also ensure that sufficient police force shall be deployed to protect the building/monument,” the Bench of Justice Salil Rai and Justice Samit Gopal said in the order.\nDuring the hearing, the counsel of Rana told the court that a year ago, the ASI had conducted a survey of the heritage building in October 2023. “The ASI report confirms that the Hammam was built in 1620 AD,” lawyer Vikrant Dabas told the court.\n“Despite repetitive requests made to the respondent authorities and to the police no action is taken and there is likelihood that the entire structure would be demolished as the same is carried on by using bulldozers and machines, and the entire structure would be erased within a day or so,” the PIL read.\nThe counsel also argued that as per the Ancient Monuments and Archeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, it is the duty of the ASI along with the State authorities to protect the 400-year-old Hammam from being demolished.\nThe High Court listed the matter to be heard afresh on January 27, 2025, by an appropriate bench. “The matter shall not be treated as tied up or part heard to this Bench,” the court said in its order.\nYou want to be the smartest in the room.\nYou want access to our award-winning journalism.\nYou don’t want to be misled and misinformed.",
