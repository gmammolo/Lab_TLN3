  "text": "It’s Christmas Morning. I love this morning. The world is always quiet when I wake up. The tree is decorated, the music is on, prepping for Christmas brunch, and getting ready to head to the kids for the afternoon.\nIt is a day when you feel peace. I always want to bottle it up and shake it out a little bit at a time daily until next Christmas. People look at others differently at Christmas, they aren’t as judgmental and even more there is a clearer understanding that perhaps the poor among us are perhaps the catalyst for a much larger story to be played out: they are the reason for the season.\nAs a provider to the poor, I see that clearly as our families get adopted, as shoe stores give away new shoes, as food is dispensed gleefully through volunteers all over the country. It is probably what was intended to happen all year long. Somehow that got lost a little as we handed that responsibility off to agencies and people who helped those in need.\nMy Dad always read the Christmas Story at the party they hosted on the Saturday before Christmas. With that story those who attended were reminded of their charge and seemed to take it to heart, at least for a little while. The Deacons would deliver food boxes to those in need from the church and my dad would dress up like Santa or Pastor Henson would and toys would be given to the families in need at the church. My mom was a stickler that no child should wake up without a present.\nMaybe that is the biggest gift of all about Christmas. The world is kinder and full of stillness for just a few days. Peace on Earth is more of a reality for a short while every year. Wouldn’t it be nice to just declare it so all year long? Living together in harmony is an old Hippie ideology and I guess I have lived long enough to wear that badge proudly now, but I really believe with our vast knowledge and strong desire to prosper and grow, we can include in that dream a vision of peace and acceptance.\nDaily I work with those that people help through housing, food, emergencies in the family, medical crisis, and legal problems, there is no shortage of people. There is sometimes a shortage of compassion. Not daily. Most of the time people are empathetic and they want to help but occasionally you hear “as long as they do right with it,” or “I hope they don’t sell those groceries,” or even “why did she have all those babies anyway.” It isn’t easy to hear, it is even harder to process.\nI got my plain-spoken manners from my Dad, my Mom was the diplomat. While they didn’t have a lot, they did well with what they had, we gardened and canned our food. Dad had chickens and we always had eggs, and he worked full time and pastored as well. He always said: “you do what you have to, it is called getting by.” And so, we do.\nThose I serve do the same, and with grace. There are very few who are difficult really. That can be explained by acknowledging their fear. My dad also always said “it is harder to ask than to help”.\nHe understood how difficult it was to say I need you to a stranger. Funny, this is the time when we celebrate the birth of one who was sent to teach us how to help strangers and how to be a good neighbor.\nSo, in that as we settled into our Christmas brunch with some of our friends and prepared to go to our children’s home for gifts, we kept all of you in our thoughts. Peace, and I hope your Christmas has been wonderful.",
