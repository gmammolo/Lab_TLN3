The state plans to notify recipients with a letter providing the exact amount they’re set to receive. Just a few days after receiving the letter, a check for the unclaimed property will arrive in the mail.\n“As Vermonters face an affordability crisis, the MoneyBack Program is putting hard-earned money back into Vermonters’ pockets this holiday season,” state Treasurer Mike Pieciak said in a Wednesday press release.\nThe new program builds on a 2023 pilot program by Vermont’s tax department and the treasurer’s office that returned $75,000 to more than 300 Vermonters with mailed checks ranging from $200 to $225.\n“During the pilot program, we used certified mail so we could closely track the accuracy of the addresses verified by the Tax Department and had a 99 percent delivery rate,” Kunin wrote. Any letters with an incorrect address will be returned, and the money will remain in unclaimed property for the owner to claim, he said.\nPieciak plans to continue to launch other proactive ways to return unclaimed property to state residents, according to the press release.\nThis story, by Klara Bauters, was first published by VTDigger on Dec. 18.\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Tags Vermonters Mailbox Moneyback Unclaimed Property Tax Department Data Financial Assets Missingmoney.com Payout Treasurer × Post a comment as anonymous Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Your comment has been submitted.\nanonymous\n× Report Cancel Report Abuse × Reported\n× There was a problem reporting this.\n× Watch this discussion.
