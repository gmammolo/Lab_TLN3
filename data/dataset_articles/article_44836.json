  "text": "Imagine you are ten years old and on a rec league basketball team. You are all skinny elbows and knees and high tops. You dribble behind your back and between your legs and lose the ball out of bounds. You shoot w y too far out from the goal. You drive wildly into the lane and launch one-handed scoop shots. Once, the ball swished through the net, and you were more surprised than anyone else. You chest-bumped one of your teammates, and he fell down, laughing.\nYour coach claps and smiles. He teaches two-handed bounce passes. He demonstrates how to set a screen and how to box out. He preaches teamwork and fair play. Your dad says he’s a decent guy, even if he is a Duke fan. Your coach explained how to line up for free throw shots, but one of your teammates spun around so many times that he wobbled into the lane like a drunk in the street and fell down, laughing. Of course, he’s the coach’s son.\nYou are not the only player on your team prone to taking wild shots and coughing up turnovers, so the games are low-scoring contests. Another teammate crumpled to the floor with what looked like a twisted ankle, but he bounced right back up and ran down the court.\nLosses, however, keep you down. Sometimes you weep and try to hide it by stomping around the court. Your coach calls you and your teammates into a huddle after the game. He says that he’s proud of all of you. He praises you for a lovely inbounds pass. Then he passes out Doritos and Gatorade. You and your teammates scarf the chips and guzzle the drinks. You are smiling again. One of your teammates leaps at you for a chest bump, and this time you fall down, laughing and laughing.",
