  "text": "Minnesota state parks offering guided hikes on New Year’s Day\nThe hikes are being held at 10 state parks as part of a nationwide effort to connect people with the outdoors, according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources\nST. PAUL — Several Minnesota state parks are hosting guided \"First Day Hikes\" on New Year's Day, Wednesday.\nThe First Day Hike is described as a winter walk offering a new perspective on the landscape — slower and quieter, but with much to experience.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe hikes are being held at 10 state parks as part of a nationwide effort to connect people with the outdoors, according to a news release from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. In an initiative spearheaded by America’s State Parks, hikers in all 50 states will welcome the new year with an outdoor hike, exercising and connecting with nature.\nMinnesota’s First Day Hikes will be held at Blue Mounds, Fort Snelling, Jay Cooke, Lake Bemidji, Maplewood, Minneopa, Nerstrand-Big Woods, Sibley, Whitewater and Wild River state parks. There is no participation fee, but some of the hikes require advance registration.\nFor more information, visit the DNR's First Day Hikes webpage at\n[mndnr.gov/firstdayhike.](http://mndnr.gov/firstdayhike)",
