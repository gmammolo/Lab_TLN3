  "text": "ARCADIA, Calif (KABC) -- Joe \"Peppy\" Sciarra, a proud [World War II](https://abc7.com/tag/world-war-ii/) veteran, is marking a monumental milestone for his 100th birthday.\nSurrounded by family and friends, Sciarra celebrated the special day at [Holy Angels Church](https://abc7.com/tag/catholic-church/) in Arcadia. In recognition of his extraordinary service, he received heartfelt honors from both the Vatican and Los Angeles County.\n\"I venture to say that this is the only 100-year-old in this diocese and probably in the world that is still in active ministry as an usher at this Mass,\" Holy Angels Church Father Kevin Rettig said.\nRelated Story: [100-year-old WWII veteran remembers fallen friends on Memorial Day](https://abc7.com/videoClip/memorial-day-world-war-ii-veteran-army/14923620/)\nSciarra's impact extends far beyond this milestone. He continues to inspire, traveling across the nation to share powerful stories of his battles, unexpected leadership and love -- having been married to his wife for over 70 years.",
