  "text": "BOISE — A year after it was asked to leave the county facility downtown, Faces of Hope Foundation is up and running about a half mile away: Faces of Hope's new location at 209 W. Main St. opened in July.\nIn the large historic building, Executive Director Paige Dinger sees a lot of potential for expansion.\n“There’s so much space here that we feel we can grow for years to come,” Dinger said.\nAda County commissioners in 2023 asked the nonprofit serving victims of domestic violence, sexual abuse and other crimes to leave its downtown center, which, at the time, shared the name Faces of Hope with an unrelated, county organization, KTVB reported.\nThe split occurred because of disagreement over Faces of Hope’s new location in Meridian having the same name as the county building as well as disagreement over a renewal of a licensing agreement to continue operating in the center. The county later renamed its building the Ada County Victim Support Center.\nThis year, which also marked the opening of the new Faces of Hope Meridian location, the foundation served more than 1,400 people, Dinger said. Its crisis services include safety planning, legal aid, short-term counseling and support groups, classes and case management, and emergency assistance with things such as food, gas, shelter, clothing, diapers and more.\nThe Main Street building is about 10,000 square feet, Dinger said, and the foundation is currently only using about two thirds of the available space.\n“It gives us plenty of opportunity to grow,” Dinger said. “ … As far as services, one of the biggest needs that we find from our clients is their emotional well-being, and also they have a lot of legal questions.”\nShe said the goal is to expand the available counseling and bring in more legal advisors. In January, third-year University of Idaho law students will be providing legal support alongside the foundation’s attorney Margo Anderson.\nPaige Dinger, executive director of the Faces of Hope Foundation, speaks at an event in this April 4, 2023, file photo.\nBrian Myrick / Idaho Press Dinger said another major problem many of the clients who leave abusive relationships face is homelessness. She hopes to grow the number of case managers to help locate housing.\nKATRINA BROWNLEE SLATED TO BE GALA SPEAKER\nAs the foundation has grown and moved into new spaces, it has required more donor support, Dinger said.\nThe nonprofit’s largest fundraiser — the Faces of Courage benefit gala — is slated for April 25, 2025. The goal this year is to raise over $200,000 and fill around 800 seats, Dinger said.\nThis year’s speaker will be retired New York Police Department detective and domestic violence survivor Katrina Brownlee.\n“We’re always trying to find a speaker that is inspiring and courageous to help others in the community understand the work that we do, but maybe also help others feel courageous if they are thinking of leaving their abuser,” Dinger said.\nBrownlee at age 22 was shot 10 times by her then-fiancé, who was a New York City corrections officer. She has said in past interviews that although he abused her frequently, police officers would turn the other way when he flashed his badge, CBS news reported.\nBrownlee, who had two young children at the time, had to relearn to walk and had to live in a shelter as she faced homelessness.\nIn 2001, little over eight years after her attack, Brownlee joined the NYPD. Her goal was to change the system from within. She worked undercover and became a detective first-grade — NYPD’s highest investigative rank.\nKatrina Brownlee\nPhoto provided by Faces of Hope During her 20 years of service, Brownlee did not tell anyone about her experience with domestic abuse, fearing she may be deemed unfit.\nNow, Brownlee is a regular speaker, has written a book, and founded a nonprofit to mentor at-risk young women.\n“To be able to tell my story now, is such a relief and a sense of peace in my life,” Brownlee told the Idaho Press in emailed responses to questions. “I finally feel free.”\nBrownlee said it’s important to talk about domestic violence because there’s still a stigma attached to it.\n“People of all races, religion and gender suffer in silence,” she said. “We survivors are the hope for the hopeless and the voice for the voiceless.”\nHer advice to those facing domestic violence is:\nNever tell your abuser you’re leaving Put an exit plan in place Find a safe haven location Tell someone you trust Find a community of people that will support you A local survivor is also slated to speak at the gala, Dinger said.\nAccording to the Faces of Hope website, tickets will be available to purchase starting on Tuesday, Jan. 7.\nTickets are $150 and will be available online at facesofhopeidaho.org/foc2025 .\nLaura Guido is the Statehouse reporter and covers Idaho politics.
