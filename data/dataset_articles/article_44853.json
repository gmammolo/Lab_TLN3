Ready in 45 minutes, this creamy soup is a great vegetarian option for busy weeknights!\nWe are right in the middle of soup season and I couldn’t be happier. I LOVE making soup, whether it’s a classic potato soup or something new. I’m always trying out new soup recipes and this red lentil soup is one of my favorites. It’s one of the few lentil recipes I’ve perfected and oh my, it’s so good! Remind me to start cooking with lentils more because they’re so easy and versatile to work with!\nWhy This Is The Best Red Lentil Soup Recipe There are lots of good lentil recipes out there but I am definitely convinced this is one of the best. Here are a few reasons why.\nReady in 45 minutes. Red lentils cook quickly so this soup comes together in well under an hour. A lot of the flavor comes from the sauteed veggies so there’s no need to simmer it for hours either. SO much flavor. Lentils themselves don’t have a big flavor profile but this soup definitely does. The veggies are sauteed first, which adds depth to the flavor, and there’s a generous amount of Aleppo pepper flakes added for a smokey flavor. So, so good! Tastes better the next day. I love making this creamy red lentil soup at the beginning of the week and enjoying the leftovers for lunch throughout the week. Sometimes I’ll even make a batch with plans to enjoy it later. It’s definitely a soup where the flavors get better with time! Great vegetarian (or vegan) option. If you’re trying out Meatless Monday or having some vegetarian friends over, this soup is a great option. Just use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to keep it vegetarian and swap the heavy cream for coconut cream to make it vegan. So easy! What You’ll Need In addition to lentils, you’ll need a few veggies, broth, and a handful of other ingredients to make this soup. You can find the exact measurements of each ingredient in the recipe card below.\nOlive oil – For sauteing the veggies. Veggies – Carrots, onion, and red bell pepper add flavor, color, and substance to this creamy lentil soup. Salt Garlic – For additional flavor. Tomato paste – Adds rich umami flavor to the broth. Aleppo pepper flakes – Aleppo pepper is a traditional Turkish spice and lends a wonderful smokey citrus flavor to the soup. It is less spicy than regular red pepper flakes and gives the soup its bright color. I like this brand. Red lentils – Red lentils cook quickly and have a creamy texture, which makes them perfect for soup. Broth – Use vegetable broth to keep this soup vegetarian (or vegan) or chicken broth if that’s what you have on hand. Heavy cream – If you are opting for a vegan red lentil soup, coconut cream can also be used. Lemon juice – Fresh lemon juice is key. It brightens up the soup by adding a bit of acidity. How To Make Red Lentil Soup This lentil soup is surprisingly quick and easy to make! Scroll down to the recipe card below for the printable version of the instructions.\nCook the veggies. Cook the veggies in oil over medium-high heat. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Cook until softened and browned, about 10 to 12 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the aromatics. Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, and Aleppo pepper flakes. Cook for a minute. Simmer. Stir in the red lentils, broth, and water. Bring to a boil then cover and reduce to low. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. The lentils should be very soft and the carrots easily smashed against the pot. Blend. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup to your desired consistency. Add the cream. Stir in the cream and lemon juice. Taste test and add more salt if needed. Enjoy. Ladle into bowls, add your desired garnishes, and enjoy! Tips & Variations Here are a few things I’ve learned while making this red lentil soup recipe.\nDon’t try to rush sautéing the vegetables. Most of the flavor in the soup comes from the caramelization of the sugars in the vegetables, so if you don’t let them cook long enough the soup won’t have a deep, rich flavor. Aleppo pepper substitutes. If Aleppo pepper is unavailable, substitute with a pinch of regular red pepper flakes (do not use an entire teaspoon, the soup will be too spicy). Alternatively, regular paprika can be used to flavor the soup without adding spice. What if I don’t have an immersion blender? You can also puree the soup in a blender. Just transfer half of the soup mixture to a blender and puree until smooth. Return the puree to the soup pot and stir well to combine. Add more salt if needed. Depending on the salt content of your broth, you may need to add an extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt at the end of cooking in step number five. Definitely taste test it first as some brands of chicken broth can be quite salty on their own! Serving Suggestions I like to add some garnishes to the bowls before serving this soup. Additional cream, lemon slices, cilantro, Aleppo pepper flakes, and freshly cracked black pepper are all good options.\nFor a heartier meal, I like to serve this soup with a scoop of basmati rice in the bowl. It soaks up the broth so nicely and makes it a bit more filling. Another option is to serve with a side of crusty bread. You just want something to make sure you get every last drop of the tasty broth in the bowl!\nHow To Store & Reheat Leftovers Fridge. Store leftover red lentil soup in an airtight container in the fridge. It tastes even better the next day! Leftovers will last for up to 4 days. Freezer. To freeze the soup, allow it to cool completely then transfer to a freezer-safe container. Freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge. Reheat gently on the stovetop, stirring frequently. Reheat. Reheat leftovers on the stovetop, stirring frequently. This soup will thicken as it cools. When reheating leftovers, you may wish to add a little extra water or cream to loosen it up.
