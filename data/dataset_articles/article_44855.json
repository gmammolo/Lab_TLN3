In that time, Illinois lottery players have won over $6.5 million in the multi-state lottery drawing.\nWhere can I buy a Mega Millions ticket? The top 10 locations The Illinois Lottery on Thursday revealed the top 10 retailers in the state that have sold the most winning Mega Millions tickets in 2024, most of which are in the Chicago area. Here is the list:\nLucky Mart, 2900 W. 87th Street, Chicago Kostner Korner, 4356 W. Howard Street, Skokie Mares Mini Mart & Deli, 7850 W. Addison Street, Chicago Glenwood Amstar, 18659 S.

There are 7,000 Illinois Lottery retailers across the state, or players can log in to the Illinois Lottery website or app and purchase a ticket. Retailers receive a commission on every ticket sold — and a selling bonus of 1% of the prize amount on any winning tickets.\nDuring this run, with more than $51.6 million in total ticket sales, the Illinois Lottery has returned nearly $21 million to the Common School Fund to support education across the state.\nWhen is the next drawing for Mega Millions? The next drawing is Friday, Dec. 27. Mega Millions is played every Tuesday and Friday night. Tickets are $2 each, and players can add the Megaplier for an additional $1 for the chance to multiply non-jackpot prizes.\nLooking for Dec. 24 numbers?
