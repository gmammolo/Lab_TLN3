  "text": "Once upon a time, Christmas shoppers — including many in the Kirkwood and Webster Groves areas — would line up to buy a cuddly critter with soft antlers, a festive scarf and a stocking cap.\nIt was a moose for the masses.\n“Other stores offered teddy bears for their Christmas promotions. We wanted something different to set us apart,” said Lonnie Tapia, former point-of-sale marketing manager for the now-defunct St. Louis-based discount retailer, Venture Stores.\nTapia and his team created the dapper “Moostletoe” and his friends, “Holly” and “Snowball,” to sell in Venture Stores all over the Midwest — including the one at South Lindbergh Boulevard and Interstate 44 in Kirkwood, and the onemon Laclede Station Road in Maplewood.\nThe cuddly critters were ticketed for $19.99 each, but people who spent more than $30 got them for $10.\nPhotos and TV commercials shot in New York with elaborate winter backdrops helped make “Moostletoe” and “Holly” household names in cities where Venture had a strong presence, especially St. Louis, Chicago and Kansas City.\nVenture was founded in 1970 as a division of the St. Louis-based May Department Stores Company, which owned Famous-Barr and Lord & Taylor, among numerous other traditional department stores across the country.\nWith “Save with Style” as its slogan, Venture appealed to shoppers who were image conscious, but budget minded.\n“We tried to upgrade ourselves, rather than being simply price-point-driven,” said Tapia. “Everything we did was with that in mind. You’re always looking for that ‘Ooooooh moment,’ and ‘Moostletoe’ turned out to be a big part of that.”\nArtists, designers, copywriters and other members of Venture’s collaborative creative team had a hand in developing the legend of “Moostletoe,” “Holly” and “Snowball.”\n“We created this wonderful fantasy winter wonderland for ‘Moostletoe’ and his friends,” Tapia recalled.\nCreative & Versatile\nTapia was born in and grew up in and out of Columbia, Missouri. Out of a tumultuous childhood, he discovered his talent for creating art and set about mastering the fundamentals of painting, sculpture and graphic design, along with a healthy dose of salesmanship.\nHe has produced hundreds of artwork in various forms and styles.\nHe’s a widely-recognized pioneer in the realm of Instinctivism, a mode of artistic expression that involves laying down and connecting lines and shapes drawn from memory and the artist’s imagination.\nWhen Tapia was a young husband and father looking for work, a friend encouraged him to apply for an opening in Venture’s creative department in 1986.\n“They needed someone who does a lot of different things,” Tapia said.\nHis third interview with the company was with Ann Armbruster, senior vice president in charge of marketing. She closed his portfolio after looking through half of it and offered him a job.\n“I was thinking I was only going to get some freelance work,” he recalled. “I said, ‘I don’t know much about retail.’ She told me, ‘We can show you all of that. We need someone who’s creative and versatile.’”\nThe ‘Ooooh’ Factor\nTapia remembers the day the first “Moostletoe” plush toys arrived at the company’s headquarters.\n“They threw them out on one of conference tables,” he said.\nArmbruster was the first to grab one and hug it.\n“The concept of a moose was different,” Tapia said. “Everyone could see it was going to go over really well.”\nThe creative team took the concept into overdrive.\nLife-size “Moostletoe” and “Holly” costumes that were made for TV commercials were sent to several Venture locations for employees to wear for in-store promotions and local Christmas parades.\nTapia created festive air-brush illustrations of the moose brigade to be painted on decorative popcorn containers.\n“That was the first time they had four-color processing on popcorn tins,” he said. “They were going to order 10,000 of them, and I said, ‘You’re gonna need a lot more than that!’”\nThe company increased the order, “and they still sold out right away,” he added.\nTapia worked with company copywriters to create an illustrated storybook to attach to each “Moostletoe” character, along with packaging and coloring books for the “Moose Meals” that were served at Christmas time at the snack bars located in Venture Stores.\n“I’d go back into work in the middle of the night and was staying until 2 or 3 in the morning,” he said. “I’d work on things like backdrops and photography that would be difficult to do during the day, because you get a ton of distractions.”\nTapia enjoyed learning about retail while helping members of the 18-person creative team focus on their individual passions.\n“Teaching each of them the perks they wanted to learn and exposing them to techniques, marketing, advertising and photography — we all had a lot of fun,” he said.\nAll of this fueled Tapia’s zest for teaching and mentoring, which he would pursue full force later in his career.\nBack then, he would visit Venture locations throughout the St. Louis area, incognito, observing customers and trying to figure out their motivations.\n“You appeal primarily to women,” he said. “Then as now, they are the primary purchasers out there. So, when you’re creating something for children, you think about how it will resonate with children and their moms.\n“Again, that’s where the ‘Ooooh factor’ comes in,” he said. “That’s the effect we tried to get when we shot those commercials in New York, with the kids hugging ‘Moostletoe’ and ‘Holly.’”\nVenture’s moose promotion was originally slated to last for two years, but the company kept “Moostletoe” and “Holly” at the top of its Christmas list for several years beyond that.\nFor many who lived within Venture’s sphere of influence at that time, the characters became icons of Christmas time and childhood, well past when the company went out of business in 1998.\nVenture provided valuable experience for Tapia, who wound up doing similar work for larger retailers in New York.\n“I got to dabble in a lot of areas, which made it a good trying ground for me,” he said.\nNostalgia Trip\nTapia interviewed a few years later for a job with the creative team at Brooks Brothers in New York.\n“When I started showing the ‘Moostletoe’ drawings, all the people in the interview recognized him,” Tapia recalled. “They said, ‘I know this! I know this!’ They had purchased him for their nieces and nephews.”\nTapia thrived for a while in NewYork, securing a comfortable lifestyle for himself and his young family. But he came to realize that all of this was taking a toll on his soul.\nIn 1995, Tapia and his wife decided to move their family back to Missouri, where he started his own business, TapiaConcepts.\nIn 2013, he accepted the role of an art teacher at the recently established Fr. Tolton Regional Catholic High School in Columbia, where he continues to teach.\nPinned to the art room wall there is a photo of one of Tapia’s colleagues, Tolton Catholic music teacher Brian Parks, seated next to a brand new “Moostletoe” toy.\nThe child in the picture is no bigger than the moose.\n“I look at that picture all the time and show it to my students,” said Tapia. “It puts a smile on my face. It puts things into perspective. Mr. Parks and I have had this hidden connection since he was little.”\nTapia also keeps the original “Moose Meal” prototype box in his art room, along with a vintage “Moostletoe” and “Holly.”\nHe said they’re just a few emblems of his life’s mission to help his students vanquish fear of failure and embrace their innate creativity.\nA visitor recently asked Tapia why he had a “Moostletoe” and “Holly” in his classroom.\n“I created them,” he answered.\nThe visitor, who had worked at Venture and sold hundreds of the popular stuffed animals, was astounded.\n“We probably passed each other and said hello to each other in the store all those years ago,” said Tapia. “That’s just the way the world is. You never know who you’re going to run into.”\nJay Nies, a former staff member of the Webster-Kirkwood Times, is now editor of The Catholic Missourian in Jefferson City. He previously worked in customer service at a Venture store for eight years.",
