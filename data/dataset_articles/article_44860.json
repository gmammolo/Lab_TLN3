  "text": "Dozens of local youths and their families were a little merrier this holiday season thanks to the generous efforts of Kirkwood police officers and their backers.\n“Shop With A Cop” celebrated a seventh successful year when 45 children went shopping with police officers at the Kirkwood Walmart earlier this month. Officer Gary Baldridge reported the details of the annual event to city leaders on Dec. 19.\nMeeting at the store, 27 local families and dozens of volunteers converged for food, fun, and gift getting and giving. Each child was partnered with a Kirkwood officer to go shopping using a donated $125 gift card.\nThe children get to choose what winds up in the shopping cart, and the officers get the opportunity for some “Elf Duty,” as Baldridge called it.\n“We take them shopping. They get to spend time with an officer, build a relationship, build a rapport,” Baldridge said. “We have a great morning. It’s as fun for us as it is for the kids.”\nSome kids have to be encouraged to spend at least some of the money on themselves, Baldridge said, as many use the opportunity to get gifts and food for their families. While one child filled a cart with groceries, another picked out a much-desired bicycle.\n“My baby loved the experience — it’s her first year doing this. You guys rock,” one grateful parent said.\nFamilies this year also were provided with an additional $50 gift card to Aldi supermarkets.\nBaldridge said the officers work directly with the Kirkwood School District to identify children whose families may not be “doing as blessed as other families.”\nThe annual event is a partnership between the Kirkwood Police Department and the Kirkwood Police Officers Association, as well as numerous private contributors. Baldridge described the event as a true team effort with assistance coming from officers’ spouses, civilian employees and other Kirkwood residents.\nWalmart and its employees contributed milk, juice, donuts and coffee for the children and families, as well as a dedicated check out lane. The store also donated wrapping paper so the officers and community partners could assist in wrapping the cherished gifts.\nCommunity partners this year included Enterprise Bank of Kirkwood, Andy Kramper of the Arrow Box Company, and Tom Endres of Tom’s Service Station.\nKeith Rawlings of local service organization Youth In Action brought the idea of a partnership between local youth and the police department to officers in 2017. To this date, 324 children have been part of the Shop With A Cop event and Baldridge said he is proud this has become an annual tradition.",
