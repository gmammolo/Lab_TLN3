  "text": "GENESEE COUNTY, Mich. (WJRT) - As the holiday season unfolds, the first night of Hanukkah coincided with Christmas this year for the first time since 2005, creating a unique opportunity for celebration and reflection among communities.\nRabbi Yisroel Weingarten, co-director of Chabad House of Eastern Michigan, said, “It’s very seldom that they correspond together.\"\n“As we progress through the holiday, we continue to increase our light,” he said. “We don’t just leave it on the candelabra; we must bring that light with us through our actions.” The menorah lighting serves as a reminder to spread cheer and goodness during this festive time.\nThis year’s celebration is particularly poignant against the backdrop of ongoing conflict in Israel. “Unity, freedom, and tradition is always the focus,” Rabbi Weingarten explained, “but it shines a bit brighter this year.” He referenced the tragic events of October 7, 2023, which have heightened the community’s resolve to celebrate with confidence, knowing the deep significance of their traditions.\nRabbi Weingarten highlighted the resilience shown by many, regardless of faith. “Every human being, so many people we come across—not just Jewish people—are doing whatever they can,” he said, acknowledging the widespread support for the Jewish community.\nThe lighting of a 22-foot menorah is a centerpiece of the celebration, embodying the universal message of Hanukkah: to bring light into a dark world. “We always light the candles at night because it is our job as Jews and as humanity to spread light,” Rabbi Weingarten stated.\nAs the festivities continue through January 2, 2025, this year’s celebration invited all to appreciate the diverse religious landscape and the blessings of freedom. “Universal freedom, which this country is so blessed with, is in the United States of America, and hopefully, it will catch on in other countries as well,” Rabbi Weingarten said, reinforcing the hope for unity and peace in troubled times.\nThere will also be a 7-foot menorah standing throughout all eight days of the holiday in downtown Flint on Saginaw Street. This menorah is co-sponsored by the Flint Downtown Development Authority, the Flint Jewish Federation, and Chabad of Eastern Michigan.",
