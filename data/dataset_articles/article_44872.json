  "text": "Couple Riley Statham and Katie Dean were looking to adopt a kitten and get engaged — and they did both at the Oregon Humane Society, in that order.\nFor his proposal, Statham enlisted the help of the animal shelter’s staff, who placed a custom heart-shaped tag on the kitten they had chosen to take home.\nThe tag was engraved with a question: “Marry Me?”\n“I’ve been meaning to propose to Katie for so long,” Statham said. “I’ve always known that when I was going to propose, it was going to include a cat or a kitten in some way, and luckily, Katie has been wanting a new cat for so long that she wasn’t going to suspect anything.”\nOn Dec. 21, the couple drove from their home in Brush Prairie, Washington, to the Oregon Humane Society’s Portland campus. They’d been talking about adopting a kitten as a companion for their older cat, Willow, who also came from the Oregon Humane Society.\nAbout a week ago, Statham contacted shelter staff to say he was thinking of proposing when they came to adopt. By all accounts, this would be the shelter’s first marriage proposal. Staff were thrilled.\nChloe Retallack, a community resource center specialist with Oregon Humane Society, suggested the collar with a “Marry Me?” tag.\n“It was such a great idea, and instantly everyone was so excited about it,” Retallack said. “Animals are so important to relationships and people. It makes sense to have them involved in the engagement.”\nAfter looking at adoptable pets on the shelter’s website, Statham and Dean spotted a kitten named Kynareth (after a character from Skyrim video game), and made an appointment to see her.\nThe meet and greet went well, and after they decided to officially adopt Kynareth, shelter staff took the kitten in the back and brought her back out with the tag. Statham pulled out a diamond ring.\nDean said yes to both the kitten and the man.\n“I had no idea,” Dean said. “It was just shock.”\nAfter the proposal, they walked out to the lobby where their parents and siblings had gathered to congratulate them.\nDean and Statham were high school sweethearts at Vancouver’s Mountain View High School. They had picked out an engagement ring together, though the timing of the proposal was a surprise.\n“We’ve been talking and dreaming about getting married for like 16 years,” Dean said. “After prioritizing other things in our life like trying to save up for a home, things like that, the wedding took a backseat.”\nSince their story was shared by the Oregon Humane Society and picked up by local news stations, readers have suggested they name the kitten Mary. Dean and Statham are waiting to see what the kitten’s personality tells them. They’re opening to changing her name but are calling her “Kynnie” for now.\n“I hope that a couple of kittens or dogs or puppies will be adopted from this,” Dean said. “And maybe a couple of people will get engaged, I don’t know.”\nJust remember, cats — like spouses — are ideally a lifetime commitment.\n©2024 Advance Local Media LLC.
