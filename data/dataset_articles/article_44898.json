  "text": "Bowling Green coach Scot Loeffler is happy for the seniors on his roster who persevered through what he called the program's \"dark era.\" The Falcons' senior class would love nothing more than to go out with a win in the 68 Ventures Bowl against Arkansas State on Thursday in Mobile, Ala. Bowling Green (7-5) last won a bowl game in 2014. The program suffered seven straight losing seasons from 2016-22, exceeding four wins just once before its recent turnaround. \"I'm super proud of the guys that have been part of this program for four, five and six years,\" Loeffler said, per the Toledo Blade. \"They were part of the dark era, as I would say, and they really have made this place a competitive, hard-working, do-right program.\" One subplot is star tight end Harold Fannin Jr.'s pursuit of multiple FBS records. Fannin enters the bowl game with 100 receptions for 1,342 yards and nine touchdowns. If he gains just 11 yards against Arkansas State, Fannin will break Jace Amaro's single-season record for tight ends set in 2013. Fannin is also 12 catches away from setting the single-season receptions record at the position (James Casey, 111, 2008). Fannin was the first tight end in FBS history to be named a conference's player of the year when the Mid-American Conference gave him the honor. \"He's phenomenal. Phenomenal athlete, really good guy, too,\" Falcons linebacker Brock Horne said. \"... Obviously, he helped out the team a ton, and just looking forward to him putting the orange and brown on one more time and having a good bowl game.\" \"He needs to go to the National Football League as fast as he can,\" Loeffler added. Arkansas State (7-5) won four of its final six games in the regular season to join the ranks of the bowl-eligible. The Red Wolves' last winning season was 2019, which was capped off by their most recent bowl win. It's been their best showing under coaching veteran Butch Jones, who's led Cincinnati and Tennessee to bowl victories before. \"We have to be better than we were (at Monday's practice) from a fundamental execution standpoint, from a habit standpoint,\" Jones said. \"All that goes into playing winning football. But I like our mindset so far.\" Arkansas State's Jaylen Raynor threw for 2,562 yards with 14 touchdowns and nine interceptions. Zak Wallace led a multipronged rushing attack with 622 yards and 10 touchdowns. The greater concern is the Red Wolves' defense, which allowed 32.3 points per game and 460.7 yards per game, the latter ranking sixth-to-worst in FBS. \"Obviously we've been decimated up front in the defensive line with some season-ending injuries,\" Jones said. \"But right now, we're as healthy as we can possibly be since going through a long season.\" Bowling Green, conversely, allowed just 20.3 points per game. Falcons quarterback Connor Bazelak passed for 2,654 yards and 15 touchdowns this season. Terion Stewart led the ground game with 890 yards and six scores. --Field Level Media\n'Dark era' over, Bowling Green sizes up Arkansas State in 68 Ventures Bowl\n- Field Level Media\n- Updated\nSuccess!
