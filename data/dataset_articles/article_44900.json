  "text": "[Cricket Score Centre ](/news/sport/score-centre/cricket)\nPerth Scorchers beat Brisbane Heat in Big Bash League, after brilliant run outs and big hitting from Nick Hobson\nThe Perth Scorchers have overcome a masterclass bowling display from Spencer Johnson to secure a crushing 33-run Big Bash League win over the Brisbane Heat in front of 41,921 fans at Perth Stadium.\nThe Scorchers posted 6-165 in Thursday night's clash, with power hitter Nick Hobson blasting an unbeaten 47 off 16 balls to help the hosts recover from a sluggish start.\nJohnson, who missed the Heat's first two games of the season with a toe injury, starred with a career-best 4-20 from four overs.\nIn reply, the Heat's hopes were cruelled by two incredible run outs before being bowled out for 132 in 19.4 overs, with only Matthew Renshaw (36 off 24 balls) and Max Bryant (35 off 20 balls) able to get on a roll.\nThe result improved Perth's record to 2-2, while the Heat are now 2-1 following their first defeat of the season.\nHobson struck five sixes and two fours in his blistering knock.\nHe smacked Xavier Bartlett for 24 runs in the Scorchers' final over, with the first four deliveries being a 6, 4, 6, 6.\n\"I love batting at that six role, but definitely it has its pros and cons,\" Hobson said.\n\"Some days you feel like you're batting the wrong way around. It can be hard work to hit it.\n\"And then days like today, it finds the middle and the crowd go wild.\n\"It was pretty cool that last over when the crowd were getting involved and the momentum was starting to build. It was a lot of fun.\"\nThe Heat slumped to 3-22 in the fifth over of their run chase after Tom Banton (7), Jimmy Peirson (1) and Colin Munro (6) departed cheaply.\nAshton Agar's effort to run out Heat skipper Peirson sent the crowd wild.\nAgar dived full length at gully to reel in the racing ball with his right hand. He then switched the ball to his left hand and swivelled on his knees in the one action before throwing down the stumps.\nRenshaw unleashed a series of huge blows to get the scoreboard ticking along after that.\nBut the Heat were on the back foot yet again when Scorchers import Finn Allen threw down the stumps from backward point to run out Nathan McSweeney at the non-striker's end.\nThat moment of magic reduced Brisbane to 4-62 in the ninth over, and when Renshaw holed out in the deep, the Heat were 5-73 and not in a position to launch another counter-attack.\nAgar finished with 1-14 from his four overs as Perth's stand-out bowler.\nEarlier, Allen's disastrous start to his time at the Scorchers continued, with the NZ blaster out for a five-ball duck.\nIt followed on from scores of six, four and 0.\nJohnson had figures of 1-0 after nine deliveries, and his miserly spell helped Brisbane restrict Perth to 1-18 from the four-over power play.\nMatty Hurst (28 off 25 balls), Cooper Connolly (37 off 37) and Aaron Hardie (24 off 23) all struggled for fluency, but Hobson's late heroics helped give the total an important boost.\nAt one point, Johnson had figures of 2-4 off 2.5 overs in a superb return from injury.\n\"It was nice to get back out there,\" Johnson said.\n\"I missed a couple of games, so just to be back in the Brisbane Heat shirt is nice, and to contribute as well is always good.\n\"But unfortunately, we couldn't get the win.\"\nIn the earlier game, James Vince overcame illness to hit a blazing century and help the Sydney Sixers pull off one of the most dominant BBL chases ever, hauling in 195 with 11 balls to spare to beat the hapless Melbourne Stars.\nUnwell before the match and requiring medication to settle an unhappy stomach, Vince hit 101 from 58 balls at the SCG to win the battle of the Brits over the equally hard-hitting Ben Duckett.\nThe successful chase with eight wickets to spare was the eighth biggest in the 14-year history of the BBL, and the biggest in any match at the SCG.\nIt also kept the Melbourne Stars winless after four games with their finals hopes fading fast, while the Sixers remain undefeated after three matches.\nAAP\nThe ABC of SPORT\n[ABC Privacy Collection Statement](https://help.abc.net.au/hc/en-us/articles/360001511015).",
