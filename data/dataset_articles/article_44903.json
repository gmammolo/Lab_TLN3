  "text": "In a year Donald Trump's personal fortune it jumped from 2.5 to 6.1 billion dollars, an increase of 3.6 billion. How he calculated Forbesthey make around 300 million a month. Ten million a day. According to the analysis carried out by the American magazine on the wealth of the president-elect of the United States in January this year, the net value of his assets amounted to 2.5 billion, down compared to the 4 billion with which he first entered the House White in 2017. But the numbers started shooting up when the Trump Media & Technology Group companywhich operates the social media platform Truth Social, has entered Wall Street.\nTHE CASE\nTrump: “For me there are only men and women, enough with the gender madness. And we will take back Panama.”\nFrancesco Semprini\nDecember 24, 2024\nSince then the stock has fallen and then recovered “in a vortex of positive and negative news, of sudden growths and sensational collapses”. As of May 9 this year, Trump had amassed fortunes of over $8 billion, the maximum reachedthen falling to five billion and rising again to eight. Even the echo of last July's attack ended up giving a boost to the stock on Wall Street. As the November 5 presidential elections approached, shares began to decline, only to rise again immediately after the announcement of his victory over his rival Kamala Harris. In his first month as president-elect, assets rose again to 6 billion and then grew by another half billion in the space of eight days and then settled at 6.1. He will not be the one to directly deal with his mountain of dollars: Trump has handed over his market shares to a trust that will manage the assets during the duration of the presidential mandate.\nthe president-elect\nTrump is Time's person of the year, his second time\nby our correspondent Alberto Simoni\nDecember 12, 2024",
