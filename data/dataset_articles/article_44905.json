Kauf was the duals champion and Giaccio won singles.\nJaelin Kauf/Courtesy Photo The skiing power of Steamboat Springs was put on display in front of the world over the weekend as alumnae with the Steamboat Springs Winter Sports Club swept the moguls competitions at the World Cup in Bukuriani, Georgia.\nOlivia Giaccio, 24, and Jaelin Kauf, 28, continued to make their mark on the World Cup scene after taking gold medals in the single and dual events, respectively.\nGiaccio dialed in for the singles runs of Friday, nailing her aerials and turns to stand atop a World Cup podium for the first time since winning in Deer Valley in February.\nJoining Giaccio on the podium was Kauf, who placed third and was down the hill faster than any other skier by more than 2.5 seconds.\nGoing into Saturday’s duals, Kauf said she felt confident in her ability to take another podium. The course in Bakuriani is the longest on the World Cup circuit at 280 meters, explained Kauf. The length playing to her strengths of undeniable speed and giving her every advantage in the dual competition.\nShe did not disappoint.\n“I was really able to set myself apart on that course with the speed,” Kauf explained. “On singles day I skied 2 or 3 seconds faster than the other girls on the podium and that was a huge confidence boost going into duals day, knowing I could beat everyone down that course without having to push it or do anything more.”\nKauf’s speed reigned supreme on duals day, making her way down the course the quickest in each head-to-head round. She ultimately won the event after taking down Japan’s Rino Yanagimoto in the Big Final for her first World Cup win since Dec. 9, 2023, in Sweden.\nGiaccio did not start in the round of 16.\nKauf tinkered with her aerial package in the offseason, ultimately deciding to swap her bottom and top air tricks for her singles runs. She now performs a Cork 720 at the top and follows up with a Backflip Mute Grab on the bottom, which is opposite of her runs a year ago.\n“I never really considered switching that up too much, but we played around with it and realized it worked really well…” Kauf said. “I was able to carry more speed and confidence with my skiing into the Backflip Mute Grab on the bottom air.”\nIn duals, Kauf still rips the Cork 720 on the top air, but elects for a Back-X on the bottom air to complete her run. It was this package which earned her first victory of the season.\n“I’m super stoked to get that result and end this first period and be home over the holidays with that,” Kauf said. “It felt really good to start the season that way. I felt really strong in those first couple events and felt that all the work put in over the summer really paid off.”\nBakuriani was first to host a duals event this season, meaning Kauf is the world leader on the moguls circuit in duals. To honor her lead, she will wear a yellow bib in the next duals race to signify her status.\nKauf’s goal for the second part of the season is to continue wearing that yellow leader’s bib and go down as world champion.\nKauf and Giaccio will be back in action in New Hampshire’s Waterville Valley for the next moguls World Cup on Jan. 24 and 25.\nJaelin Kauf, a former Steamboat Springs Winter Sports Club moguls skier, wears her yellow bib which signifies she is the world leader in dual moguls following her victory in Bakuriani, Georgia, on Saturday.
