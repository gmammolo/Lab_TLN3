  "text": "After her rebirth in [Paris](/tag/Paris) during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, Céline Dion has new projects for 2025, including two albums.\nIt is one of the most beautiful collaborations in French song. Céline Dion and Jean-Jacques Goldman, the exceptional singer and the (greatest) singer-songwriter. Diamond record in 1995 with nearly 4.5 million CDs sold, “D'eux”, Céline Dion's fifteenth album, written and produced by the Frenchman, remains the best-selling French-speaking album in the history of music.\nThe rest after this ad\nAfter a long convalescence, the Quebec singer found the strength to sing in 2024, first during the Paris Olympic Games ceremony on July 26, 2024, then on November 13, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to celebrate her friend Elie Saab . Two albums are in preparation. The first, in English, has been under construction for several months. “The idea is that she covers her greatest songs in duets with others,” we are told by those around her. All the music stars come to Las Vegas, it's quite easy to organize recording sessions there. » But nothing is organized at the moment.\nA single title\nOn the other hand, there is a second disc in preparation, this time in French. Jean-Jacques Goldman, the man behind “So that you still love me”, “If it was enough to love” or “Encore un soir”, was obviously requested. “They don’t need to see each other or talk to each other to understand each other. Jean-Jacques was always the one who best summed up Céline. It's hard to do without him. » He will only sign one track on this new album. There is no doubt that it will be a new hit. “So that you still love me” remains one of the flagship titles of her repertoire, which she still sang during her residency in Las Vegas in 2008.",
