  "text": "1000-Lb Sisters star Amy Slaton is in a reflective mood as she celebrates her happiest memories from 2024. Amy and her siblings, including Tammy Slaton, Chris Combs and Amanda Halterman, have undergone impressive transformations as they all lost weight and took back control of their health. Amy recently revealed a new family member, which was a lizard. Aside from that unexpected pet, the 1000-Lb Sisters season 6 star also admitted her kids are named after characters from horror films. Her year wasn't filled with all happy moments, though, as she was arrested and recently pleaded guilty to alleged drug possession.\n1000-Lb Sisters' Amy Slaton shared her \"2024 Replay,\" consisting of her best and favorite moments from the entire year while showing off her weight loss success.\nWith just days to go until the end of the year, Amy took to Instagram recently to personally reflect on what her life has been like over the past 12 months in a photo and video montage she called her \"2024 Replay.\" The post started off in January 2024 with Amy posing against a brick wall while wearing a red outfit. Throughout the montage, she also showed off a black dress, her kids, her pet spider, drinking soda, blowing a kiss in front of a mural, debuting a blue hair color and celebrating the holidays.\nThe post received almost 12,000 likes, with over 400 people leaving comments. The 1000-Lb Sisters star received some backlash over the more tragic parts of her life, like her arrest and alleged bad behavior. However, most of the comments section of her Instagram post was filled with a lot of her followers praising Amy for how far she's come in her weight loss journey and wishing her a happy Christmas.\nWhat Amy Slaton’s “2024 Replay” Reveals About Her Health Journey\nAmy Wants To Focus On Happy Moments In Her Life\nDespite some turmoil in her life, including legal troubles and relationship issues, Amy wants to end 2024 by focusing on the moments that made her happy and smile, like her fashionable outfits and especially her kids. A few commenters gave her a hard time over the incident at the zoo and her behavior, both on 1000-Lb Sisters and away from the cameras. However, this is Amy's Instagram account, and she gets to post whatever she wants and paint herself in whatever way she wants, no matter what backlash might result from it.\n[Related\n](/best-reality-tv-shows-right-now/)\n[\n20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\n](/best-reality-tv-shows-right-now/)\nReality TV is more popular than ever. With so many to choose from, here are some of the best reality TV shows to stream or watch right now.\nIt doesn't look like Amy has replied to any of the replies in her comments section. If she did scroll through them, she would see mostly positive messages with a handful of critical comments as well. Since she's trying to end 2024 by focusing on the positives, staying away from the comments section was a smart move to make.\nOur Take On Amy Slaton’s “2024 Replay” Instagram Video\nAmy Can Use 2025 As A Fresh Start For Her Life\nAmy has made huge mistakes in her life and made extraordinary progress on her weight loss journey. Hopefully, her 2025 turns out to be a lot better than 2024, with fewer (preferably no) legal issues and all success stories. Life is always unexpected, no matter how much you plan for it to turn out a certain way. The 1000-Lb Sisters star certainly didn't plan to be in the news for all the wrong reasons this year. Fortunately, she can kick off 2025 with a fresh start and look ahead instead of stewing in the past.\nSource: https://www.instagram.com/amyslaton_halterman/reel/DD4of_-OFbZ//Instagram",
