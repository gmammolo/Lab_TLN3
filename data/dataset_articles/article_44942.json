More info\nJoin us on WhatsApp Leeds United went to the top of the Championship with a 2-0 win over Stoke City thanks to a brace from Joel Piroe on Boxing Day.\nThe visitors were comfortably the better side and took control after the opening knockings. Jayden Bogle had a terrific game and linked up well with Daniel James on the right. The winger, a live wire all match, eventually got his assist in the second half.\nPiroe had not scored in five matches prior the trip to Staffordshire but will travel back to Yorkshire with a confidence boost after two well-taken goals. He now has nine for the season. A number of other players can hold their heads high after showing that they can do it on a cold, misty night at Stoke.\n1 - Illan MESLIER\nMade a good stop inside the first two minutes from Lewis Koumas. Didn&apos;t have much to do otherwise but that save at 0-0 alone was important given Leeds&apos; frustration away from home before this game. 7\n2 - Jayden BOGLE\nPlayed several balls through to the onrushing Daniel James. Lovely nutmeg on Lynden Gooch in the first half and was really productive throughout the first half. Never looked quite at the same pace after his knock shortly after half-time but still worked the touchline. 8\n6 - Joe RODON\nCommunicated with Bogle well throughout the match to put out fires. An assured presence and kept Stoke striker Tom Cannon quiet for the entirety. 8\n5 - Pascal STRUIJK\nA calm and assured presence throughout. Barely troubled and always chose the right option, whether it be a pass or a clearance. 8\n25 - Sam BYRAM\nPlayed the sensible ball while trying to be proactive and positive. Did the basics well and kept Stoke&apos;s attackers out of the box. A professional display. 7\n4 - Ethan AMPADU\nDictated play from the quarter-back role and initially dipped back to help the defence when needed. This got less and less as Leeds took control and he became the engine for most attacks. A sturdy display. 7\n8 - Joe ROTHWELL\nDid the hard graft to allow Ampadu and those around him the space to drive forward. Not the most notable performance but still an impactful one, make no mistake. 7\n7 - Daniel JAMES\nLinked up with the ever-working Bogle very well and provided a number of brilliant balls. Had Gooch on toast a number of times and was always a threat. Got his well-deserved assist for Piroe&apos;s second and was given a big round of applause from the away corner as he was taken off. 9\n11 - Brenden AARONSON\nProved to be a headache for the hosts and provided the through-ball for the goal. A good display yet quiet for large patches and a sense of that he had another gear that wasn&apos;t unlocked. 7\n14 - Manor SOLOMON\nShould have scored in the first half from James&apos; cross midway through the first half. Was much better on the second half and went close a few times. Did better when told to go direct. 7\n10 - Joel PIROE\nTook his first goal from the angle really well having not managed to do much with the half-chances he had before. Couldn&apos;t miss his second one from just three yards out. A real confidence-booster. 8\nSUBS 17 - Largie RAMAZANI (on 76 mins)\nHad a good run down the left shortly after coming on and produced a teasing cross with nobody there. Was the brightest of the substitutes, always looking to get in behind. 6\n19 - Mateo JOSEPH (on 79 mins)\nFlashed an effort wide a few minutes into his appearance before being unable to steer home under pressure from a corner. 6\n22 - Ao TANAKA (on 79 mins)\nCarried on where Rothwell left off. Did his job fine albeit managed only a few touches. 5\n29 - Wilfried GNONTO (on 76 mins)\nMade a nice curved run to invite a defence-splitting ball. Kept running. 6\n33 - Isaac SCHMIDT (on 90 mins)\nToo late for a rating. N/A\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
