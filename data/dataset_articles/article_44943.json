At 2,300 acres along Pocomoke Sound it’s the largest nature preserve owned by the Maryland Ornithological Society.\nLocated on Rumbly Point Road near Marion, the hike will be two miles. Meet at Janes Island State Park at 10 a.m. in the camper check-in parking lot and participants will caravan to Irish Grove.\nOn New Year’s Day sleep in this year as the Ranger-led hike will not be in the morning but a sunset hike starting at 4 p.m. starting at the Janes Island State Park Nature Center.\nParticipants may want to bring a flashlight for the one-mile walk through the Whitetail Trail that ends along the Daughtery Creek Canal in time for sunset.\nThis marks 10 years since First Day Hikes have been held at Janes Island, and pre-registration for either hike is not required. Leashed pets are welcome but these are not stroller or wheelchair accessible sites. Bring water, binoculars for the birding walk, and wear appropriate footwear as sections of trail may be wet or muddy.\nContact the office at 410-968-1565 or the Duty Ranger at 443-614-2591 for more information.",
