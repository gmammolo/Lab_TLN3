  "text": "Thailand Boosts New Year's Road Safety with Tougher Drink-Driving Penalties\n-\nRecently Browsing 1 member\nAnnouncements\n-\nTopics\n-\n-\nLatest posts...\n-\n8,354\n-\n72\nIs it starting?Two tankers and a crane barge have foundered in the Black Sea and Sea of Asov. These were old (50 years+) river vessels which economic constraints/sanctions had led Russia to attempt to use in open waters, with which they were unable to cope. A more modern Russian cargo ship has sunk in the Western Mediterranean. This vessel was en route from Saint Petersburg to Vladivostok via Suez. For the previous couple of years it had shuttled between the Russian Baltic ports and Syria. Because it was Russian flagged and sailing between Russian controlled ports it had not been subject to effective inspections for seaworthiness; it's sinking is suspected to be due to a catastrophic engine failure and lack of \"damage control \" equipment and procedures. -\n16Mother Dies in Motorcycle-Truck Collision, Four-Month-Old Baby Seriously Injured A crash occurred in Pathum Thani when a motorcycle collided with the rear of a parked six-wheeled truck, resulting in the death of a 32-year-old mother and critical injuries to her four-month-old baby. Full story:https://aseannow.com/topic/1347266-mother-dies-in-motorcycle-truck-collision-four-month-old-baby-seriously-injured/\n-\n20\n-\n207\nIs Earth round or flat❓You have been indoctrinated fully if you believe Dave Weiss the man that says a 24 hr. sun is impossible in Antarctica. -\n3\nDeterioration of Dining Quality and ExperienceNoticed the same. Worthwhile topic, @Patong2021. Thank you for posting about it. Increasing discussions of exactly this topic on web sites I follow which focus on food and nutrition. They use terms like \"food inflation\" and \"fiat food\". As a result of inflation in fiat currency, restaurants and manufacturers of food products switching to cheaper ingredients and cheaper processing methods than before. What to do?? 1. I've hired a private cook three years ago. She buys ingredients that I specify and follows recipes I specify. That has worked well, IFF I stick to eating food she prepares for me. 2. Buy ingredients from the best sources I can find in Thailand. We're very fortunate here to have some excellent vendors of quality foods. Three examples are: The Accidental Butcher for beef and lamb. Paleo Robbie for beef plus many kinds of fresh produce and prepared meals. Sloane's for meat and a few prepared foods like savory pies & frozen pizza. Those are in Bangkok, but they all deliver around Thailand by refrigerated truck. I'm in Chiang Mai and frozen meat reliably arrives frozen. 3. More beef: grass fed, hormone-free beef. Eat that, always feel good after eating. Eat something else, never know what to expect. So now eating a lot of quality beef. When I stick to that I feel good. But when I want a change of pace and eat restaurant food, problems, sure. As I am typing this, right now, the time is just after 5 AM. Restless, couldn't sleep -- one symptom. Needed to visit the toilet -- another symptom. Because last night for supper I ordered from a restaurant. A nice restaurant, but still, no joy in the food. Very sad to realize this, because I've enjoyed eating at restaurants most of my life. In younger days, even worked in restaurants. Now, no. Much better to avoid restaurant food and \"ordinary\" retail food such as that from TOPS, BigC, Lotus, etc. And it's going to get worse. -\n207\nIs Earth round or flat❓You and I can climb Everest anytime. We can't go to Antartica. That's my point.\n-\n-\nPopular in The Pub\n-",
