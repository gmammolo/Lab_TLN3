She has been an integral part of the program’s growth into a vibrant weekly Senior Social Program, assisting with live music, art classes, special events, and hospitality tasks.\nSalcedo also dedicates her Thursday evenings to distributing food to families at Pronto’s Client Choice Food Pantry, bringing warmth and compassion to every interaction.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"Ms. Salcedo’s unwavering commitment to serving seniors and families in need is truly inspiring,\" said Legislator Donnelly. \"Her kindness, generosity, and hard work have made an incredible impact on our community, and it is a privilege to honor her as my 2024 Non-Profit Volunteer of the Year.\"\nResolution No. 602-2024 designated November as \"Nonprofit Volunteer Appreciation Month\" in Suffolk County, authorizing each legislator to select a nonprofit volunteer to honor. Salcedo and the other recipients were recognized in a special ceremony at the William H. Rogers Legislature Building in Hauppauge on November 19 where Legislator Donnelly presented her with a County Proclamation.\nBay Shore Woman Named 'Non-Profit Volunteer Of The Year' originally appeared on the Bay Shore Patch\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 27,876 people played the daily Crossword recently.
