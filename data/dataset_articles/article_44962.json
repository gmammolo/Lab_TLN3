  "text": "Across the world, people are searching for answers, and they don’t know where to turn.\nWhether they’re battling addictions, walking through a family crisis, or facing loneliness, their hearts ache for something more in this life—and beyond.\nPeople need the hope and joy that only comes from a relationship with Jesus Christ, but so many have never heard the Gospel.\nThat’s why the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) is traveling to five continents—North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia—in 2025 to partner with thousands of local churches and share the Good News at evangelistic events.\n“I’m personally excited because God has given us another year of opportunity to serve Him in a capacity that is just amazing and overwhelming,” said Viktor Hamm, vice president of Crusade Ministries for BGEA.\nAt each event, Franklin Graham or Will Graham will tell people how they can find new life in Jesus Christ. Those who make commitments will be connected with a local, Bible-believing church where they can grow in their walk with the Lord.\n“We have been blessed in this past year of 2024 and I do know that God will be faithful to His Word and will bless the year of 2025,” Hamm continued.\nIn 2024, thousands of people made decisions to follow Christ at Franklin Graham Festivals and Will Graham Celebrations. Will you pray that God will transform many more lives as we share the Good News in the following locations next year?\n2025 Event Schedule\nMarch 8–9: Franklin Graham is headed to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital city, where he will preach the Gospel at Encountering God in Meskel Square. Despite a history of persecution, the church has emerged in this nation, and more than 19,000 people have already signed up to be prayer counselors at the event.\nMarch 22: One year after Franklin Graham made two stops in Arizona on the 10-city Franklin Graham God Loves Frontera Tour, Will Graham will share the Good News in the same state. “More than anything, I want the people of Fountain Hills and greater Phoenix to know that Jesus loves them and has a plan and purpose for their lives,” Will Graham said ahead of the Look Up Celebration at The Fountain.\nApril 4–5: Hundreds of churches are preparing for the Esperanza Cochabamba with Will Graham in Bolivia. With growing excitement in the region, the event has already been moved to a larger stadium so that more people can hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\nMay 27–30: Church leaders across Europe have been invited to attend the European Congress on Evangelism in Berlin, Germany, where they will be encouraged to stand—and preach—boldly for Jesus Christ. Hosted by BGEA, the conference is expected to be the most representative gathering of Christian leaders in Europe since Amsterdam 2000.\nJune 21: BGEA is returning to the United Kingdom for the fourth consecutive year for the Franklin Graham God Loves You Tour in London with musical artists CeCe Winans and Michael W. Smith. Preparations are already underway for buses to bring thousands from nine neighboring regions.\nSept. 27: Franklin Graham will be preaching the Good News in Brussels, Belgium, to point the next generation to the hope of Jesus Christ. Nearly one-fourth of Brussels’ population is Muslim, and many people there do not believe that Jesus died for their sins.\nOct. 18–19: Will Graham will share God’s love during the Time of Hope Celebration in Tallinn, Estonia, which is considered to be one of the world’s least religious countries. Both Billy Graham and Franklin Graham participated in a church service in 1984 when the Eastern European country was under Soviet rule, and Franklin Graham returned to the small independent nation in 2009 to preach the Gospel to tens of thousands.\nPlease pray that God will continue opening doors—and hearts—to the Gospel message through these events in 2025. Ask Him to draw thousands to faith in Jesus Christ across the globe.",
