See disclosure policy.\nA delicious carne asada recipe made from marinated flank steak or skirt steak and grilled until tender and juicy. A great addition to any Mexican meal, this authentic recipe is made with olive oil, lime juice, garlic, cumin, oregano, and other simple ingredients.\nJuicy, melt-in-your-mouth Carne Asada was always such a treat when I was growing up!\nI remember my brother or dad would pick up some carne preparada (already marinated steak) at our local Mexican meat market on Sunday, and they’d grill it in the backyard while my Mom and sisters finished making the side dishes.\nWhen it was time to eat, they’d serve the meat on big platters family-style alongside things like Mexican rice, some Mexican salsas, and homemade corn tortillas. It’s always been one of my favorite Sunday lunches with the family because the meat is just so good!\nWhat is carne asada?\nCarne asada is beef that has been marinated and grilled. When translated from Spanish, carne asada literally means “grilled meat.” Pretty simple, right?\nThe most common type of meat used to make carne asada is skirt steak or flank steak. Skirt steak is usually thinner and a bit more fatty, whereas flank steak is often a thicker and leaner cut. As long as they’re both sliced thinly after grilling, they both make great options for carne asada.\nCarne asada marinade Ingredients\nIn addition to the cut of beef, one important component is the marinade.\nThe marinade for carne asada varies greatly from region to region in Latin America, and there is no real one “authentic” marinade. Some marinades are as simple as oil, salt, pepper, garlic, and lime juice, and others are a long list of ingredients and spices.\nFor this carne asada marinade, I leaned towards the latter and tried to get in as much flavor as possible by using some of the following:\n- chopped cilantro\n- olive oil\n- orange juice\n- lime juice\n- white wine vinegar\n- chili powder\n- ground cumin\n- dried oregano\n- garlic\n- a finely chopped jalapeno\n- salt and black pepper\nOnce the marinade is mixed together, simply pour it over the steak in a large baking dish, bowl, or large zip-top bag and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours.\nHow to make carne asada\nOnce the meat has been marinated, remove it from the marinade and pat it dry. Then drizzle both sides with a little bit of olive oil so it doesn’t stick on the grill, and season it lightly with kosher salt and black pepper.\nPlace it on the grill over medium-high heat for about 8 to 10 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the meat, and then let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing it thinly against the grain.\nNo grill? No problem!\nIf you don’t have an outdoor grill or the weather isn’t suitable for grilling outside, you can cook carne asada indoors!\nSimply heat a large skillet over high heat. A cast iron skillet or grill pan are great options. Then cook the meat for 6-8 per side until your desired level of doneness is reached.\nMake sure to turn on your stove top’s vent hood to get rid of any excess smoke that can happen when cooking at high heat.\nAt what temperature is it done?\nTo get the most tender and juicy carne asada, the meat should be cooked to medium-rare. To do so, take the beef off the grill once it has reached 130°F and let it rest for 5 minutes. If you prefer your meat at a medium temperature, remove it from the heat when it reaches 140°F.\nMy husband likes to use the finger test to check for doneness, but I’m not very good at it, so I always use a meat thermometer.\nHere’s a great instant-read thermometer that’s easy to use. It’s a kitchen tool that I use almost every single day!\nTips and Tricks\n- Make sure to slice the steak against the grain for the most tender carne asada. To slice against the grain, make note of which way the muscle fibers of the meat are running, then slice perpendicular to those lines.\n- Cook time will vary depending on the thickness of the meat. Grilling time for skirt steak will be closer to 4 minutes per side, and flank steak will be closer to 6-8 minutes per side. You can also use a meat thermometer for accuracy.\nWhat to serve with carne asada\nTwo of my favorite dishes to make with carne asada are carne asada fries and carne asada tacos! But just in case you’re looking for more ideas, here are some dishes that pair perfectly with this recipe:\n- flour tortillas\n- salsa verde\n- chimichurri sauce\n- guacamole salsa\n- refried beans\n- elotes (mexican street corn)\nStoring and Reheating\nLeftover carne asada can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\nTo reheat, heat it in a hot skillet on the stove or in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes, flipping it over halfway through so that it heats evenly.\nMore Mexican Recipes\n- Carnitas\n- Barbacoa\n- Homemade Mexican Chorizo\n- Chicken Taquitos\n- Tacos al Pastor\n4.66 from 128 votes\nCarne Asada Recipe\nservings: 8 servings\nPrint Pin Review Save\nPrep: 10 minutes minutes\nMarinating time: 2 hours hours\nCook: 20 minutes minutes\nTotal: 30 minutes minutes\nA delicious carne asada recipe made from marinated flank steak or skirt steak and grilled until tender and juicy.
