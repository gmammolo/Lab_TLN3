  "text": "December 26, 2024\nContact: Scott Tillman, U.S. Term Limits\nPhone: (321) 345-7455\nstillman@termlimits.com\nAaron Baker Pledges to Support Term Limits on Congress\nWashington D.C. – U.S. Term Limits (USTL), the leader in the non-partisan national movement to limit terms for elected officials, praises 2024 U.S. House candidate for Florida, Aaron Baker (district 6), for signing the pledge for an amendment to term limit Congress. Previously, candidate Randy Fine also signed the pledge. The special primary election is scheduled for January 28, 2025.\nU.S. Term Limits has the support of more than 150 pledge signers in Congress. USTL President Philip Blumel commented on Baker’s and Fine’s pledges saying, “Aaron’s and Randy’s strong support of term limits shows that there are individuals who are willing to put self-interest aside to follow the will of the people. America needs a Congress that will be served by citizen legislators, not career politicians.”\nThe U.S. Term Limits amendment pledge is provided to every announced candidate for federal office. It reads, “I pledge that as a member of Congress, I will cosponsor and vote for the U.S. Term Limits amendment of three (3) House terms and two (2) Senate terms and no longer limit.”\nBlumel noted, “We have seen a dramatic increase in supporters wanting term limits on Congress. More than 87% of Americans have rejected the career politician model and want to replace it with citizen leadership. The way to achieve that goal is through congressional term limits.”\nAccording to the latest nationwide poll on term limits conducted by Pew Research, term limits enjoy wide bipartisan support. Pew’s analysis states, “An overwhelming majority of adults (87%) favor limiting the number of terms that members of Congress are allowed to serve. This includes a majority 56% who strongly favor this proposal, just 12% are opposed.”\nBlumel concluded, “America is in trouble. Our career politicians have let the people down. It is time to return control of our nation to the people. It is time for a constitutional amendment limiting congressional terms.”\nThe term limits amendment resolutions would require a two-thirds majority in the house and senate, and ratification by 38 states, in order to become part of the U.S. Constitution.\n###\nU.S. Term Limits is the largest nonpartisan, nonprofit organization advocating solely on term limits. Our mission is to improve the quality of government with a citizen legislature that closely reflects its constituency and is responsive to the needs of the people it serves. USTL does not require a self-limit on individuals. Our aim is to limit the terms of all members of Congress as an institution.
