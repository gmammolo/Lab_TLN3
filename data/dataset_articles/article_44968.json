  "text": "Batata Vada\nBatata vada is popular Maharashtrian street food. This can be served with a hot cup of tea/coffee or with dipping sauces like cilantro chutney or ketchup. Or batata vada can be used while making vada pav.\nBatata vada means potato fritters (aloo vada or potato vada).\n❤️About This Batata Vada Recipe\nBatata vada has two components, inner filling and outer coating.\n- The inner filling is made from boiled, mashed potatoes and it is seasoned with ginger, garlic, green chili and curry leaves.\n- For outer coating, the thick batter is made from besan (gram flour), rice flour and seasoned with salt, turmeric and chili powder.\n- The round balls are made from potato filling. Then balls are dipped into the batter and deep-fried into the hot oil.\nDeep Frying is a must.\n- No, this cannot be shallow fried.\n- They have to be submerged into the oil while frying to keep the round shape intact.\n- If they are shallow fried then you’ll end up with flat vada and not a perfect round.\n- This is the only reason I don’t make these vada often as I have to heat a whole lot of oil that I can’t reuse. Plus, these are full of calories.\nThis batata vada recipe is the Maharashtrian style. There is another version is Gujarati style where potato filling is not seasoned with tempering.\nIn the Gujarati version, ginger-chili paste, cilantro, red chili powder, salt, sugar, lemon juice, etc are added to the boiled, mashed potato. Personally, I prefer this Mumbai style batata vada, as the Gujarati version has mild flavors.\n🧾 Ingredient Notes\n- Potatoes: I prefer to use Yukon gold or red skin potatoes. I avoid using Idaho potatoes as you can’t make the balls after they are boiled and mashed as they are high in starch and low in moisture.\n- Ginger, Garlic, Green chili – You can crush all three together. Or simply use ginger garlic paste and finely chopped green chilies.\n- Curry leaves: These are must-add as they add a nice aroma and flavor to the potato filling.\n- Lemon juice: It is optional. Some don’t prefer to add any lemon or lime juice.\n- Besan + Rice flour: The addition of rice flour makes the outer coating crispy. So I like to add it. But traditionally, the batter is just made from besan and spices.\n- Baking soda: a tiny pinch is added to make the batter and outer coating light. You can skip it as I don’t see much difference without soda.\n👩🍳 How To Make Batata Vada? (Stepwise)\nMaking Potato Filling:\nBoil the potatoes in instant pot or pressure cooker. Once cool to touch, peel them and mash them using a potato masher.\n1) Heat the oil in a pan on medium heat. Once hot add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Then add ginger, garlic paste, green chili and curry leaves. Saute for 30-40 seconds or until the raw smell of ginger-garlic goes away.\n2) Add hing and turmeric powder.\n3) Immediately add mashed potatoes and salt.\n4) Mix well and cook for 2-3 minutes or until the mixture is almost dry.\n5) Turn off the stove. Lastly, add lemon juice and cilantro.\n6) Mix well. Taste and adjust the salt as needed.\n7) Remove the mixture to a plate and let it cool down completely.\n8) Then divide into 8 equal portions and make round balls. If making small batata vada then you’ll get more than 8.\nMaking The Batter:\n1) Take besan, rice flour, salt, turmeric powder, red chili powder and baking soda in a bowl. Mix well.\n2) Add water and stir to make a lump-free batter. The batter should not be too thin or too thick. It has to be thick yet runny consistency.\nMaking Batata Vada:\n1) Heat the oil in a kadai or pan on medium heat for deep frying. Make sure to add enough oil so that vada are submerged into the oil.\n2) Once the oil is hot, take one ball, and dip it into the batter. Move around so it is coated with the batter from all sides.\n3) Now pick up the ball using your finger or use a spoon.\n4) Gently slide the vada into the hot oil. Do not disturb them for 2 minutes otherwise, they will break into the oil. After that stir or move around in the oil for even browning.\n5) Once they are fried to crisp and light golden color, remove them using a slotted spoon, and drain excess oil.\n6) Place them on a paper towel lined plate. Serve them hot.\nNOTE: Make a slit into green chilies and fry in the oil until they have blisters on the surface. Remove it from the oil, sprinkle some salt on top and serve with vada.\n💭 Expert Tips For BEST Batata Vada\n- The potato filling mixture should not have too much moisture or water. If your boiled potatoes have more moisture in them then cook until it dries out so you can shape them into the balls.\n- To avoid too much moisture in the filling, try not to overcook the potatoes. They should be soft yet firm.\n- The batter consistency is the key to getting a perfect balance of filling and outer coating. If the batter is too thin then you’ll get no taste of the outer layer and feel like just eating potato. If the batter is too thick then the outer layer can become hard, chewy and taste too dough-like.\n- Instead of deep-frying, you can use a\npaniyaram panto cook them. In that case, make smaller size batata vada that can fit into the sections of your paniyaram pan. - Make ahead: You can make potato filling or balls ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator. You can make the batter a few hours earlier. At the time of serving just fry them. Make sure to bring the potato filling to room temperature before frying.\n- Reheating: You can reheat them in the oven or air fryer until crisp. Avoid using the microwave as it makes them soggy.\n🍽 Serving Ideas\n- Serve with a side of fried green chili and your choice of dippings like\ngreen chutney, ketchup,dry garlic chutneyortamarind date chutney. - It can be eaten alone with a hot cup of tea or coffee.\n- This can be stuffed into the buns with other chutneys to make\nvada pav.\nCheck Out Other Deep-Fried Snacks Recipes\nDid you try this batata vada recipe?
