  "text": "Longtime NFL wide receiver DeSean Jackson will take over as head coach at Delaware State, Victory Formation Media and ESPN reported Thursday. If confirmed, it would be the latest data point in a growing trend of FCS football teams hiring well-known former players -- with little to no prior coaching experience -- in an effort to stand out. Jackson, 38, has no connection to Delaware State but according to ESPN, \"it has always been a dream\" of his to coach at an HBCU (historically black colleges and universities). Earlier this month, Norfolk State hired Michael Vick to take over the Spartans' program. Vick, who also reportedly heard from Sacramento State, hails from the Norfolk, Va., area. Norfolk State is one of Delaware State's rivals in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. Colorado coach Deion Sanders spent three seasons (2020-22) as the head coach of Jackson State before moving up to the FBS level. His only prior coaching experience came at the high school level, including at his own short-lived charter school in Texas, \"Prime Prep Academy.\" Jackson last played for the Baltimore Ravens in 2022. He is best known for two stints with the Philadelphia Eagles (2008-13, 2019-20) and played for a total of six teams in a 15-year NFL career. Jackson caught 641 passes for 11,263 yards and 58 touchdowns, adding four rushing touchdowns and four punt return touchdowns in 183 career games. Delaware State went 1-11 in 2024 (0-5 MEAC) and fired coach Lee Hull after the season. The Hornets have not had a winning season since going 6-5 in 2012. --Field Level Media\nLatest e-Edition\n- To view our latest e-Edition click the image on the left.\nMost Popular\nArticles\n[WHAT A MESS](/free/article_dfd0ebae-c157-11ef-bf3f-63fce17c6164.html)[City Commission goes “nuclear” after Chamber Appointment to RDA Board](/free/article_9a602676-bef4-11ef-882f-27ff94bb6c51.html)[MADISON COMMUNITY MOURNS A LOCAL ICON](/tmn/article_4d34bd12-bdd7-11ef-bd96-df22f2c6e554.html)[Lee Charles Muller](/free/article_62854c54-bf12-11ef-81f3-4b0e808601ea.html)[Car catches fire in ESB Financial Parking Lot](/gaz/article_46a6a79a-bf20-11ef-ab4e-7b65eb6c6f47.html)[“Speaking with one voice:” Diving into the origins of the RDA](/business/article_c230cd8e-c158-11ef-bbdb-2bd6ebac7b98.html)[Karen Sue Edwards](/free/article_4ee13a7c-c170-11ef-921e-7ff4f9840574.html)[Mike Turnbull Facade Grant program to provide up to $10,000 for exterior design renovations](/business/article_16386250-c156-11ef-8f5d-079ae9322020.html)[JoAnn Rincon](/free/article_7748fcac-c170-11ef-9c83-cfa6d28ab755.html)[THE WALL THAT HEALS IS COMING TO EMPORIA, KANSAS ON AUGUST 14 -17, 2025](/free/article_30b70bb4-be80-11ef-9a4c-d306cd12ab21.html)\nImages\nVideos\nSorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.\nCommented\nSorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.",
