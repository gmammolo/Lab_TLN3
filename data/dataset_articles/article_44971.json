  "text": "MURRAY, Ky. — The Western District Fisheries Office in Murray has opened a drop-off location for natural Christmas trees as part of the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources' Christmas tree recycling program.\nThe office is located at 30 Scenic Acres Drive in Murray and is one of 33 total drop-off sites in the state. The office will accept natural Christmas trees for the Christmas for the Fishes program, which recycles the trees into fish habitat in lakes across Kentucky.\nAll drop-off locations will accept trees from Thursday, Dec. 26, through Wednesday, Jan. 15. According to the department, the trees will be weighted and deposited in lakes across the state to serve as protection, shade and feeding habitat for multiple fish species.\nThe tree habitats often improve angling opportunities in the areas they are placed. Anglers can visit the Lakes with Fish Attractors page to view the locations of the tree habitats.\n\"We want to ‘light up’ fishing opportunities by improving fish habitat in 19 public lakes across the commonwealth next year,\" said Spencer Phillips, fish habitat biologist with Kentucky Fish and Wildlife. \"Natural Christmas trees donated through the program will be bundled and dropped in the lakes to provide aquatic cover that fish need to survive and thrive.\"\nNatural trees must have all lights, garlands, ornaments and decorations removed before donation, according to the department. Artificial trees, limbs, brush, and other plants will not be accepted.\nSee the full list of drop-off locations on KDFWR's website .\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print",
