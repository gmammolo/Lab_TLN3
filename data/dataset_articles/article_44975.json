  "text": "Taylor Swift has been on tour for pretty much the entirety of her relationship with Travis Kelce, but now that things are slowing down a bit on her end, they’ll be able to spend even more quality time together.\nThough both superstars are always on the go, a source told Page Six that they make it a priority to stick together as much as possible. “Taylor and Travis live fairly nomadic lives, and Taylor has home bases everywhere, but they live everywhere together,” the source added.\nSwift is famously always hopping on her private jet (though she’s not even in the top twenty celeb jet users, FWIW) to maintain her cross-country lifestyle, so it sounds like staying with Kelce—whether it be at a hotel, one of her properties, or his Kansas mansion—is their version of cohabitating. However, of all Swift’s properties, the source claims Nashville current serves as a bit of a “home base.”\nRead moreTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce Are in the Joint Christmas Gift Stage of Their Relationship\nSwift’s gift-wrapping skills are unmatched.\n“It also looks like Taylor is going to make Nashville more of a home base than LA or NY since it’s closer to Kansas City, and her mom, Andrea, loves [Nashville] too,” the source said. Taylor Swift went to high school and started her career in the Nashville area, where she already owns multiple properties, so it makes sense as a “home base” during the NFL season, when she travels to Arrowhead Stadium for Kelce’s home games.\n“I think she’s adapted so well to WAG life because she truly understands what it’s like to be part of a team — especially coming off Eras where she formed such a close connection with her band, dancers, singers and crew,” said the source.\nClearly, things are serious between the two. We recently learned that they’re in the “joint gift giving” stage of their relationship, and they looked so dang sweet at her Eras Tour wrap party. When he gave her the “22” hat? Adorbs. Heck, I’d move in with that boy, too.\nRead moreTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce Clearly Had a Marvelous Time at Her Eras Tour Wrap Party\nWhat a way to end an era.",
