They’re so easy and perfectly delicious, plus they use pantry staples so you can make them on any day when those intense chocolate cravings strike. They’re soft, moist, cake-like, and perfectly chocolatey.\nAbout This Recipe\nThis is a no-fuss eggless brownie recipe using a mixing bowl, wire whisk, and everyday ingredients. The best things in life are often the simplest.\nThis is my go-to eggless brownie recipe and after one bite you won’t even notice that this brownie recipe has no eggs. They have the perfect intensity of chocolate flavor, they are sweet and rich, and they’re unbelievably satisfying.\nThe chocolate flavor comes from the cocoa powder. And to get a double dose of chocolate I have added some chocolate chips in the brownie batter. Those little melty chocolate chips in each bite will get you every time. A chocolate lover’s dream come true!\nFor some crunch, you can add roasted, chopped walnuts or pecans or almonds, or any other nuts of your choice.\nWhen it comes to brownies without eggs, it is a little tricky to make and I have failed so many times. After many trials, I got success with this fool-proof recipe. And it has the best cake-like texture. To get the fudgy, gooey texture, please try my eggless chocolate brownie recipe. Or try my no bake brownies.\nIngredient Notes\n- Flour: Unbleached all purpose flour is used here. To my Indian readers, it is called maida in Hindi.\n- For all my baking recipes, always spooned the flour into a measuring cup and leveled it (not scooped from the bag or container).\n- I suggest using all purpose flour.\n- Cocoa powder: I have used 100% natural unsweetened cocoa powder, the ones that are widely available in any grocery store like Hershey’s, Ghirardelli, etc. The color, taste, and flavor of the brownie purely depend on the quality and type of cocoa powder.\n- Melted butter: The butter is melted and cooled down (not warm).\n- Yogurt: Plain, full-fat yogurt is used here.\n- Vanilla: Always use pure vanilla extract and stay away from the imitation essence.\n- Chocolate chips: I prefer to use semi-sweet or bitter-sweet chocolate chips for a rich chocolate flavor, use good quality chocolate chips for best results.\nHow To Make Eggless Brownies? (Pics)\nPrep:\n- Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).\n- First, melt the butter in a microwave or on the stovetop. And let it cool down while you prepare the baking pan and other ingredients.\n- Lightly butter or spray with non-stick cooking spray 8×8 inch baking pan. Line it with parchment paper with sides up. So it will be easy to lift after it bakes. Again butter or spray the parchment paper.\nMaking Eggless Brownie Recipe\n1) Take all purpose flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder in a bowl.\n2, 3) Sift the cocoa powder using a strainer, so there will be no lumps of cocoa powder\n4) Whisk everything until well combined. Keep it aside.\n5) In another large bowl, take melted butter. Add plain yogurt and vanilla extract.\n6) Whisk until everything is mixed and smooth.\n7) Add dry flour mixture.\n8) Whisk it until the batter comes together.\n9) Add chocolate chips (& nuts, if using). Fold them in using a spatula.\n10) Pour the brownie batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly.\n11) Bake in preheated oven for 35-40 minutes or until the toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the brownies cool down for 10-15 minutes in the pan itself.\n12) Then lift the paper from the sides and transfer it to a cooling rack.\n13) Using a sharp knife cut into 16 pieces or as per your desire. After having a bite, you won’t realize that these are the brownies without eggs.\nStorage:\n- Store your eggless brownies in an airtight container once it cools down completely.\n- At room temperature, it stays good for 2-3 days depending on the weather/climate in your area. In humid, hot weather it doesn’t last long.\n- In the fridge, brownies stay good for around 4-5 day.\nExpert Tips & Variations\n- Make sure to line your pan with parchment paper otherwise eggless brownies will stick to it, super important tip!\n- Do not overbake or underbake. Overbaking will result in dry brownies and underbaking will result in soft and gooey brownies. For a cake-like brownie texture, the inserted toothpick should come out clean. So always check a few minutes earlier than mentioned time here as everybody’s oven behaves differently.\n- Allow brownies to cool down for at least 10-15 minutes before cutting, otherwise, it can crumble and fall apart if they’re cut too early.\n- One of the readers tried this recipe with oil. She used the same amount of flavorless oil like vegetable, canola, and safflower in place of melted butter. As per her feedback, the brownies came out good and tasted very good. You can read in the comments below.\nVariations\n- Chocolate chips: Instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips, go with white chocolate chips or mocha chips, or dark chocolate chips.\n- Nuts: if you like the crunch of nuts then feel free to add walnuts, pecans, almonds, and hazelnuts. Or skip it completely, just like I did.\n- Add coffee to brownies: For a deeper flavor add 1 to 1 ½ teaspoons of instant coffee or instant espresso powder to the batter. The brownies won’t taste like coffee but will have a richer depth of flavor.\nServing Ideas\n- Enjoy your eggless brownies as such with a glass of milk.\n- Serve a piece of warm brownie with vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of\nchocolate sauceon top. Super yum!! - Make a batch of ganache (recipe shared in this\neggless chocolate cake) and spread it over the cooled brownie (before cutting). Let the ganache set for around 30 minutes to 1 hour and then cut it into pieces.\nCheck Out Other Popular Eggless Recipes\nDid you try this recipe? I’d love to hear about it!
