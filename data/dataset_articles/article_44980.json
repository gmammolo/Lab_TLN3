  "text": "Drake London limited in practice, says he’s good for Sunday night\nThe Falcons should have wide receiver Drake London in the lineup on Sunday as they continue to work their way toward an NFC South title.\nLondon was listed as a limited participant in practice on Thursday because of a knee injury, but he told reporters, via Marc Raimondi of ESPN.com, that [he will be fine](https://x.com/marcraimondi/status/1872357127983149125) for this weekend’s game against the Commanders. The team will issue their final injury report for Sunday night’s game on Friday.\nCornerbacks Kevin King (concussion) and Antonio Hamilton (quad) were the only Falcons to miss practice entirely on Thursday.\nLinebacker Lorenzo Carter (groin), wide receiver KhaDarel Hodge (ribs), linebacker Nate Landman (rest), tight end Ross Dwelley (ankle), tight end Charlie Woerner (rest), and defensive lineman Zach Harrison (Achilles) were also listed as limited participants. Wide receiver Casey Washington (concussion) is a full participant.",
