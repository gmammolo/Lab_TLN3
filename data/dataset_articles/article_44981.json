Describing how Tyler kept on asking so many \"questions\" about the game, Kelly said:\n\"I love that Tyler asked if she could snuggle and watch the game with me last night.

Talking about how she doesn't regret cussing around them, Kelly said:\n\"You marry someone who loves sports, who's competitive like Matthew is, I'm sure he was down there cussing up a storm and I was in the suite cussing up a storm. Now my kids are used to it. They know those are adult words. We've talked about this. So I don't feel bad doing it in front of them.\" (27:43)\n\"I think Tyler said 'sh*t' when she was two. But other than that, and it was one time and I was like, 'Absolutely not.' Other than that, they know. Then on my belief, you're going to hear these words from people like me, who are, you're not expecting and I don't want you ever to repeat them, you know,\" Kelly concluded.
