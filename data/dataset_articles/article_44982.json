When Aaron Rodgers recounted his very brief Game of Thrones cameo: \"It was fun to be a part of it\" Discuss Now Quarterback Aaron Rodgers made a cameo in \"Game of Thrones.\" (Image source: Getty) Besides being a quarterback in the NFL, Aaron Rodgers has also tried his hand in an acting role. In July 2020, the quarterback, who played for the Green Bay Packers at the time, made an appearance on \"10 Questions With Kyle Brandt\" and was asked about his role on the hit series \"Game of Thrones.\"\nRodgers told Brandt that he had a small role in the show's finale episode in May 2019. He went on to describe how small of a role it was and that it was a 'blink and miss it' type of moment.\n\"There's a scene where she (Arya) kind of comes down the steps and I'm there. And, then they flip it around and you can see me briefly again. So, it's one of those things just like right there, right there and that was it. But, it was fun to be a part of it,\" Rodgers told Brandt in July 2020.

In May 2019, he told Packers.com that when he arrived in Belfast, Ireland, to film his role, he wasn't recognized by anyone, which surprised him.\n\"In Belfast, they didn't care at all. They had no idea who I was. It was fun to be a part of it. I love the show. It's a fantastic show. A lot of great seasons,\" Rodgers told Packers.com. The former Green Bay Packers quarterback told the publication that it was a fun experience, especially since he loves watching the show. After his episode of \"Game of Thrones\" aired, the quarterback shared a look at his costume on Instagram.\n\"It was just for a few seconds, but I’ll always be thankful to have been on the penultimate episode of @gameofthrones #crazyepisodetonight,\" Rodgers wrote on Instagram in 2019. Aaron Rodgers also thanked everyone for the opportunity to be a part of the show, especially the final episode of the series, which was highly talked about by fans.\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?
