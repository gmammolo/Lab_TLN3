The NFL was also running high-profile matches in the same time slots as the NBA, resulting in a split in viewership. However, after a spectacular performance, King James proclaimed that Christmas Day belongs to the NBA.\n\"I love the NFL but Christmas is our day,\" James said. (1:28) King James also praised the Warriors star Steph Curry and talked about the great performances they have been delivering together over the years.\n\"Today is a day of giving and me and that's what me and Steph continue to do and try to do for our fans, for our beautiful game so yeah big shout out to AR (Austin Reaves) though, that was big time,\" James said.
