Sean Strickland reacts to Bryce Mitchell's diss of Elon Musk’s $82,000 worth car with fiery American pride: \"I'll storm any capital with this man\" Discuss Now Bryce Mitchell's (left) rant about Tesla Cybertruck caught Sean Strickland's (right) attention. [Images courtesy: @thugnasty_ufca and @stricklandmma on Instagram] Sean Strickland was seemingly impressed with an old video of Bryce Mitchell alleging that modern American trucks are designed to be less durable and expensive.\nRecently, Strickland took to X and urged Americans yo buy a truck on Christmas, writing:\n\"There is only 1 holiday on December 25 in America and it's Christmas. Go buy a gun and a truck and then thank baby Jesus for creating America for you godless heathens...\" In response, @KOofTheDAY tagged the former middleweight champion in an old viral video of Mitchell where he expressed critical opinion about the $82,000 Tesla Cybertruck, explaining how it is not the ideal product for an average American, citing its high cost and allegedly short lifespan.\nTrending Get the latest updates on One Championship Rankings at Sportskeeda and more\nStrickland's reaction to the video suggested that he agreed with Mitchell's opinions as he wrote:\n\"My god I've never felt so American in my f***ing life.... After watching this ill storm any capital with this man @ThugnastyMMA.\" Expand Tweet Mitchell, the No.13-ranked UFC featherweight contender, has become notorious for supporting conspiracies like the flat Earth theory. His controversial opinions have often derived mixed reactions from fight fans.\nOn the professional front, 'Thug Nasty' got back in the win column with his UFC 310 victory over grappling ace Kron Gracie. Prior to that, he suffered a knockout defeat against Josh Emmett at UFC 296 in December 2023.",
