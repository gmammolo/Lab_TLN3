As she stated during her show's reunion back in March, Sophia loves being in LA.\nScottie Pippen's ex, Larsa Pippen, defends giving Sophia Pippen a $2,500 spending allowance Earlier this year, during the \"Real Housewives of Miami\" reunion, Larsa Pippen came under fire while discussing being a parent. According to Scottie Pippen's ex, the former couple's daughter gets a $2,500 monthly allowance for spending.\nSome of the other cast members and reunion host Andy Cohen seemed to be in disbelief at the amount. However, Larsa doubled down, saying that LA is expensive and Sophia makes her own money as well. During the reunion earlier this year, she responded to the shock over her daughter's monthly allowance, saying:\n\"You guys understand, like, LA is super expensive. So after school, she orders food or Uber or buys presents for her friends’ birthdays.\" With Sophia Pippen already boasting 227,000 Instagram followers, it looks like the NBA legend's daughter has already set herself up for more lucrative brand partnerships in the future as she gets older.\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?
