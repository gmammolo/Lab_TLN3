Boris Becker salutes Michael Jordan after NBA legend makes $10,000,000 donation to fund medical clinic Discuss Now Boris Becker (L), Michael Jordan (R), Sources: Getty Boris Becker lauded Michael Jordan for the six-time NBA champion's latest charitable act. Jordan was present in-person to open a clinic in Wilmington, North Carolina, to ensure the medical welfare of underinsured and uninsured residents.\nOn Wednesday, December 25, a basketball highlights page on X (formerly Twitter) shared a video of Jordan speaking at the inauguration of his third clinic, the Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Medical Clinic, in Wilmington, North Carolina. The NBA legend donated $10 million to fund the clinic. Jordan has close ties to Wilmington, having studied at the city's Emsley A. Laney High School growing up.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Jordan said,\n\"That's what this clinic is about, when the families are not able to support, we're there to support. You don't have any money, it doesn't matter. We're going to do whatever we can to support you because that's what happened to me.\" Trending Following this, former World No. 1 and tennis icon Boris Becker took notice of the post and proceeded to salute Michael Jordan , writing:\n\"MJ is a legend\" Expand Tweet In October last year, Becker had congratulated the six-time NBA Finals MVP after the latter became the first athlete to be named in the list of the 400 richest individuals by Forbes magazine. At the time, Jordan's net worth was estimated at a staggering $3 billion. The former World No. 1 shared a picture of Jordan on his Instagram stories and hailed the basketball legend as the \"GOAT\" .\nPreviously, the German tennis icon had opined that Roger Federer belonged in the \"same league\" as Michael Jordan. Becker's opinion had stemmed from Federer's remarkable resurgence in 2017.",
