Recalling the tradition and explaining how it was the “most romantic thing” that the retired NFL star said, Kylie said:\n\"One tradition outside of our kids that Jason and I did quite some time ago is we went on our first trip together as a couple and Jason had discussed we should try and get an ornament how great would it be if we eventually ended up with a tree covered in ornaments from all the places that we've been together. Which might have been one of the most romantic things he's ever said.\" Trending •\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now\nLooking to predict NFL playoff Scenarios?

(1:20). \"So naturally when we were in the airport, about to be on our way home, we had to stop into the souvenir shop that's in the airport. The only thing that they had were keychains so we committed to the bit and stuck with it. Now we have a Christmas tree covered in keychains.\" Apart from having a romantic Christmas tradition with her husband, Jason Kelce, Kylie also has a unique tradition with her kids, which the podcaster discussed during the same episode.\nJason Kelce's wife Kylie revealed Christmas tradition with daughters Jason Kelce and his wife Kylie are parents to three kids and are expecting their fourth child. Jason and Kylie share a special Christmas tradition with their daughters, where instead of buying the Christmas tree from the marketplace, the Kelce family goes out and gets it from their farm.\nTalking about the adorable tradition during the same exclusive podcast episode, Kylie Kelce said.\n\"We have for the last couple years uh cut down our Christmas tree we go to a lovely Farm nearby our Safa farms and cut down,\" Kylie said. \"We go out into the field on the tractor and we cut down our Christmas tree. The girls absolutely love it.\" \"We also have uh slowly been increasing the number of decorations that are inside of our house. We have to be mindful of what we choose and how high up we do them because kids and a lot of holiday decorations are breakable,\" she concluded.
