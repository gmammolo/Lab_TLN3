[Watch]: Virat Kohli dances hilariously to celebrate Travis Head's dismissal for a duck on Day 1 of 4th BGT 2024-25 Test Discuss Now Virat Kohli (left) celebrates the wicket of Travis Head (Image Credits: Getty Images) Senior Team India batter Virat Kohli came up with a hilarious dance to celebrate Travis Head's dismissal on Day 1 of the Boxing Day Test against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Thursday, December 26. Head was dismissed for a seven-ball duck by Jasprit Bumrah.\nBatting first after winning the toss, Australia posted 311-6 in 86 overs on Day 1 of the MCG Test. Debutant Sam Konstas (19) smashed 60 off 65 balls, while Usman Khawaja (57), Marnus Labuschagne (72) and Steven Smith (68*) also struck fifties.\nBumrah led a strong fightback for India after Australia's excellent start. He ended Khawaja's stay at the crease before dismissing the dangerous Head for a duck. The Aussie left-hander shouldered arms to a delivery from Bumrah , bowled from around the wicket. He made a complete error of judgment as the ball ended up hitting his off stump.\nTrending As the Indian players gathered to celebrate the huge wicket of Head, Kohli was seen doing a hilarious dance. He stretched both his arms wide and started moving them in a rather comical manner. [Watch video below]\nAfter sending back Head, Bumrah also dismissed Mitchell Marsh for four. The right-handed batter attempted a pull off the Indian pacer, but only managed to edge the ball to the keeper. Akash Deep then chipped in with the wicket of Australian keeper-batter Alex Carey (31) as the left-handed batter nicked a peach of a delivery outside off behind the wickets.",
