They expressed their reactions by sharing memes on Instagram and X (formerly known as Twitter). One of the fans trolled star Pakistan batter Babar Azam, who failed in the first innings, falling for 4 (11) early in the day. The post was captioned:\n\"Hey Babar Azam, this isn’t Zimbabwe.\" Expand Tweet Trending Here are a few more memes:\nExpand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet Expand Tweet South Africa pacers Dane Paterson and Corbin Bosch star with nine wickets to restrict Pakistan to 211 in the 1st Test 2024 South Africa captain Temba Bavuma won the toss and opted to bowl first in the contest. Shan Masood (17) promoted himself to the opening position in the match to accommodate Babar Azam (4) at number three. It did not work out, as both batters departed inside the first session without scoring much. The Proteas pacers gave their side a brilliant start by reducing visitors to 56/4 in 18.3 overs.\nKamran Ghulam (54) hit a counter-attacking half-century and tried to rescue his side. However, Dane Paterson dismissed him at the end of the 38th over to give the hosts a crucial breakthrough. Mohammad Rizwan (27), Agha Salman (18), Aamer Jamal (28), and the lower order batters added some runs in the end to take Pakistan to 211. Dane Paterson picked up a five-wicket haul, while Corbin Bosch scalped four wickets for South Africa in the bowling department.\nKhurram Shahzad (2/28) and Mohammad Abbas (1/36) then bowled decently to pick up three wickets with the new ball before the conclusion of the play. Aiden Markram (47*) remained unbeaten at the crease along with Temba Bavuma (4*), with South Africa on 82/3 after 22 overs.\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?
