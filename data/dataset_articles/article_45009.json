  "text": "Colchester's hospice will receive a huge cash boost as the government approves a multi-million-pound investment package. St Helena Hospice, in Barncroft Close, will receive £711,249 as part of this investment.\nMore than 170 hospices across England will receive a share of the funding, which will include specially adapted beds, rooms, and technology, as well as building works and modernised facilities.\nFinancial challenges have left the hospice with a gigantic black hole in its financing and unable to utilise more than half of its beds.\nMark Jarman-Howe, chief executive, said while the charity appreciates the government's support, the grant does not help with its financial issues.\nHe said: \"The second allocation of funding from the government of £711,249 to support our capital expenditure is very welcome, and we thank Hospice…\nNatalie Hensel",
