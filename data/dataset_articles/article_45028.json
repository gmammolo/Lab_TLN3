  "text": "The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has introduced a new WhatsApp number – 0709 570 000 – to allow the public to report crime anonymously, quickly, and securely. This digital upgrade gives Kenyans and members of the diaspora a convenient and discreet way to share crime-related information with investigators.\nThe new service complements the DCI’s existing toll-free hotline 0800 722 203, expanding the ways in which citizens can engage with law enforcement.\n“The new WhatsApp number provides an anonymous and secure channel through which the public, both locally and internationally, can share intelligence on crime,” said DCI Director Mohamed Amin.\nThe launch comes under the new Fichua Kwa DCI program – a public awareness campaign that encourages Kenyans to report crime without fear of retaliation. Through the utilization of new communication technology, the DCI also seeks to create greater public trust and facilitate greater community participation in crime prevention.\nSpeaking as the platform was relaunched on Tuesday, Amin said that the WhatsApp channel is a reflection of a closer relationship between the public and the DCI.\n“This enhancement is not just a communication tool, it is a symbol of our commitment to improving security through cooperation with citizens,” Amin said.\nHe explained that the WhatsApp line would allow for faster, easier, and more covert sharing of tipoffs on crimes and emphasized the importance of adopting new technologies as tools against evolving crime threats.\n“With the continuous advancement in technology, it’s vital that our crime-fighting mechanisms also evolve,” Amin said.\nHe added that the WhatsApp service would be most convenient to diaspora Kenyans as it will give them a direct and secure means of contributing towards security back home.\nThe DCI assured that the free-of-charge line 0800 722 203 remains accessible to those who cannot use WhatsApp. Both avenues are privacy safeguarding and guarantee complete anonymity.\nAmin acknowledged the vital role Kenyans have played in past investigations through the Fichua Kwa DCI initiative.\n“Among the many achievements we have recorded, many have been possible thanks to courageous citizens who reported suspicious activities through Fichua Kwa DCI,” he said.\nHe urged the public to continue using the newly enhanced reporting channels as part of a shared duty to secure the nation.",
