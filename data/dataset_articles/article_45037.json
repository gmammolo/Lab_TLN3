  "text": "Serving Gogebic, Iron and Ontonagon Counties\nLIKE ANY other parade, Saturday's Old Depot Car Show Cruise on Wheels draws a crowd as classic vehicles of all types travel down Aurora Street in Ironwood. As part of Festival Ironwood, the event drew a highly enthusiastic audience, with onlookers shouting \"Thank you!\" and \"Rev your engines!\" Passengers in some cars threw hefty handfuls of candy, to the delight of children and adults. \"Yeah baby!\" yelled one woman. As part of Festival Ironwood, the cruise was the culmination of the day's Old Depot Car Show, which also welcomed vintage snowmobiles and tractors.",
