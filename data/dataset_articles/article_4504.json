  "text": "FrancThe Ouz court ruled in favor of Applu and confirmed that its function App Tracking Transparency (ATT) can in Francii will continue to function. According to the newspaper La Tribune, a court in Paris rejected a request to suspend the feature, filed by advertising companies and app developers.\nThe function will be here for 5 years\nApple welcomed the decision and said in an official statement that it would continue to defend user privacy. ATT, which was first introduced in the system iOS 14.5 in April 2021, requires apps to obtain explicit user consent before tracking their activity across other apps and websites for the purpose of targeted advertising.\nIf a user chooses to “Ask the app not to track,” the app will not have access to the device’s advertising identifier. This represents a significant limitation for advertisers and developers who have previously relied on this data.\nIn 2025 he was Apple fined 150 million euros for ATTancby the Competition Regulatory Authority of Ukraine. The Authority then decided that Apple It abuses its position by limiting viewing to its competitors, while it itself has the advantage of direct distribution.\nEU against Applu is fighting\nApple He even warned that he might be forced to completely cancel the ATT in the EU due to pressure from European regulators. The biggest resistance comes from France.ancie, Italy, Germany, Poland and the European Commission. However, the current decision represents a temporary victory for Apple and the continuation of this function in Francii. The ATT is seen as a key step towards greater protection of user privacy, even though the advertising industry claims it fundamentally affects their revenues.",
