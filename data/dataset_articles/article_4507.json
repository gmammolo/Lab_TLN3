  "text": "Audio By Carbonatix\nThe Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Christian Tetteh Yohuno, has assured the public that the Ghana Police Service is fully prepared to provide security for the New Patriotic Party’s (NPP) forthcoming presidential primaries.\nSpeaking at a peace pact signing ceremony involving NPP presidential aspirants, the IGP disclosed that the party had formally written to the police some weeks ago to inform them that security for the elections would be handled solely by the Ghana Police Service.\n“Some few weeks ago, the NPP party wrote to the police to inform us that the security for the forthcoming presidential elections will be solely handled by the Ghana Police Service,” he said.\nMr Yohuno explained that the police have since identified all polling areas and finalised comprehensive operational plans to ensure a smooth and peaceful process.\n“We want to assure you that we have been able to identify all the areas where the elections will take place. We have 276 plus one polling centres. We have been able to make our operational plans,” he stated.\nHe added that the police service has engaged all regional commanders responsible for the various areas to coordinate and oversee security arrangements.\n“We have met all our regional commanders who are responsible for these areas where these elections will take place. We have gone over all the preparations over and over and are ready to go to the field,” the IGP noted.\nAccording to him, the only area where additional military support may be required is Bawku, due to its unique security situation. He revealed that the police have written to the Minister for the Interior to engage the Minister of Defence to facilitate military assistance in that area.\nMr Yohuno added that in all other parts of the country, the military will remain on standby, while the police will take the lead in providing security.\nHe further disclosed that a minimum of 70 police personnel will be deployed to each polling station, with senior officers also deployed nationwide to supervise operations.\n“We assure you that at least 70 is the least number of police officers will be at each polling station. We have deployed heavily. All senior officers countrywide are going to be at the police station,” he said.\nThe IGP outlined a layered security strategy, including inner, middle, and outer deployment, noting that the outer deployment will be heavily reinforced.\n“We have the inner deployment, the middle deployment, and then the outer deployment. The outer deployment is heavily loaded,” he explained.\nHe assured stakeholders that the police service has undertaken extensive training and preparation and that commanders across the country are confident in their readiness.\n“I want to assure you that we have done a lot of training and preparation and that my regional commanders have called me and said that they are even ready for the election today,” Mr Yohuno added.\nMr Yohuno thanked the party leadership for the confidence reposed in the Ghana Police Service to provide security for the exercise, describing it as a sign of trust in the professionalism of the police.\nThe peace pact signing forms part of efforts by the NPP to promote peaceful internal elections and strengthen unity as the party prepares for the 2028 general elections.",
