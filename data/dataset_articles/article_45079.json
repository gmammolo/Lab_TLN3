  "text": "CHICO, Calif. - Arthritis is a leading reason for euthanizing older pets, but a new treatment called Synovetin OA is offering hope to pet owners. This breakthrough is promising to change the lives of dogs suffering specifically from osteoarthritis.\nRayna Pitter was devastated when her English Bull Terrier Sookie started limping around. \"Sookie had arthritis in her left elbow... it progressed to not being able to walk on stairs, to the point where she could not put her paw to the ground,\" Pitter said.\nPitter tried various treatments to no avail. \"We had CT’s, X-rays, everything you can imagine, bone biopsies, just to find something that could relieve this extreme pain and nothing seemed to do it,\" she said.\nPitter then discovered Synovetin OA, a new treatment that offered relief. \"Sookie was the second dog in Northern California to be treated, so we kind of just lucked into it, that this treatment was out there,\" she said.\nDr. Erin Troy, a veterinarian at Muller Veterinary Hospital, has seen positive results with Synovetin OA. \"I'm very excited about what we've seen. Not only have I used it on patients but also on my own dog, and I've seen an improvement in every dog we've treated,\" said Troy.\n\"What it does is go into the joint and binds to two cells, only, and those are the cells that cause the most pain in the joints. Every time those cells are produced, it gobbles them up and keeps the dog from experiencing pain,\" she said.\nFor dogs in the early stages of the disease, Synovetin OA may be a suitable option. \"It has the ability to slow down the disease,\" Troy said.\nThe Pitters also treated their dog Roxy with Synovetin OA, and Sookie lived a happy life until age 13. \"She was able to live out her golden years the way she should, she was running, she was playing up until the end, she was happy. We really couldn’t have asked for more,\" Pitter said.",
