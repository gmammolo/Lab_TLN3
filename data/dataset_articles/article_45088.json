  "text": "The Birmingham Youth & Young Adult Fellowship Choir earns Simon Cowell’s Golden Buzzer—now on stage July 20 in Birmingham.\nBy SPEAKIN’ OUT NEWS\nChoir director Ahkeem Lee celebrates with the group after Simon Cowell hit the Golden Buzzer on AGT. BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The Birmingham Youth & Young Adult Fellowship Choir has earned the hearts of America’s Got Talent judges, receiving the coveted Golden Buzzer from Simon Cowell after a soul-stirring rendition of “Joyful, Joyful, Lord We Adore Thee.”\n“I could see and hear how much work went into this,” Cowell said before pressing the buzzer, adding, “Every single one of you played the perfect part… I’m so honored you came here on our 20th anniversary”.\nThe 10-year-old choir—founded in 2015 as a back-to-school fundraiser—took their talents to Pasadena, California for the AGT auditions. Their choreographed rendition of the hymn, infused with emotional gospel energy, earned them a standing ovation from all judges.\nChoir director Ahkeem Lee reflected on the moment:\n“Going on stage, I actually felt a sense of relief… I’ll never forget how blown away I was by the choir’s performance that night.”\nThe choir’s local impact continues: their 10th Anniversary Celebration concert and benefit is scheduled for Sunday, July 20, at 3:30 p.m. at Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. Like their first concert, it aims to support local students by distributing free school supplies.\nThis is a rare opportunity to see the choir live—don’t miss this inspiring homecoming performance!",
