  "text": "Iron County welcomes Jay Sween as new manager\nBy PAMELA JANSSON\nHurley — The new manager of Iron County just began the position on Monday.\nJay Sween is the new county manager who was just hired by the Iron County Board of Supervisors on July 9.\n“Happy to be here,” said Sween after a Tuesday meeting of the board’s Finance Committee. “I couldn’t wait to move up here.”\nOriginally from Wausau, Wisconsin, Sween spent the last 12 years working in the Division of Motor Vehicles for the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.\nDuring that time, he said he worked largely as a section chief.\nWith Sween in the brand new county position, board supervisor Larry Youngs delivered his final report as an interim administrative coordinator.\nYoungs had assumed that role on July 1 after board member Roxanne Lutgen had taken on the role voluntarily for the first six months of the year.\n“My time was short and sweet,” said Youngs, who said he tapped other board members and county employees for support during his brief stint in the role.\nHe said he was happy now to turn over those responsibilities to Sween.\nIn other news, the committee also discussed county employees’ benefit options, following a recent benefit study presentation by Cottingham and Butler Insurance Services Inc. of Madison, Wisconsin.\n“This isn’t necessarily reducing any benefits, but it would increase the options available to employees,” said Mario Loreti regarding suggestions made by the company, which included various additional benefit options.\nFinance Committee chairman Kurt Wolff agreed.\nLoreti said choices such as high-deductible plans, which allow for lower premium costs, may be attractive to younger employees.\nYoungs and Lutgen also praised the company’s suggestion to offer long-term care benefits, with Youngs describing it as “huge,” and Lutgen saying it was “long overdue.”\nLutgen suggested that a discussion of whether to exchange the county’s current options for days off with a paid-time off system — often referred to as PTO days — should be encouraged during the next meeting of county department heads.\nShe said it also could be beneficial for the county to continue using the Madison company as county officials act on the benefits analysis and on a pending wage analysis.\n“It’s sort of like a broker,” she said in relation to how the company could help the county with its expertise and connections.\nWolff also said the county may wish to consider using the company’s services throughout next year.\n“I think it makes a lot of sense to have an expert on this,” he said.\nNo action was taken at Tuesday’s meeting.\nCommittee members also:\n— Approved the posting of a legal assistant position after learning that Richard Jenkins has resigned from that role, effective Aug. 10.\n— Heard that county clerk Christan Brandt had a successful meeting with all other town or city clerks within the county regarding procedural changes.\nAt the end of the meeting, members entered a closed session.\nBy BRIANNE COOK\nHurley — Members of the Hurley City Council learned at their latest meeting that Impact Seven has completed negotiations for public financing of its housing project and now expects to have an official groundbreaking ceremony on Sept. 12.\nClerk/treasurer Stacey Wiercinski reported the news at the July 15 meeting.\nThe project, which was cleared through the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority, is earmarked for 13 to 14 acres off of Wisconsin 77, across from the Cary Mine Market.\nWith the blessing of Iron County and the Hurley City Council, the project is a collaboration between Impact Seven, a nonprofit entity that invests in community development, and Northwood Technical College. They are both based in Rice Lake, Wisconsin.\nThe multimillion dollar project is expected to include an onsite classroom, along with as many as 40 housing units of varying sizes and other amenities.\nThe project has been on the horizon since early 2024 and already underwent delays due to the need to address wetland issues.\nIn other news, Scott Santini, director of public works, advised milling and repaving a segment of 5th Avenue while road crews work nearby on U.S. 51.\nWith equipment and crews already present in the area, he said the city would incur no associated deployment cost.\nSantini estimated the cost of the street repairs at $17,000 and committed to getting bids for the work. Council took no action on the issue.\nSantini also reported that work on 3rd Avenue water lines is expected to be done soon despite having encountered multiple setbacks.\nCouncil members also:\n— Learned from Hurley Police Chief Chris Colassaco that Joseph Hallihan has been hired as a full-time officer working the night shift. The department now has a part-time position open after former Officer Cole Miller resigned as of July 9.\n— Learned that Flock Safety cameras will be installed in either August or September. These street cameras record images of license plates and other vehicle details and store the information so that law enforcement officials can access it online if needed.\n— Learned that Scott Sternhagen of CliftonLarsonAllen’s office in Green Bay, Wisconsin, has advised that a 3% simplified rate increase for sewer services will need to be implemented in March 2026.\n— Approved Colleen Sachs to be appointed to the Planning and Zoning committee.\n— Approved a structure at 400 Poplar St. to be razed, following a structure fire there.\n— Approved and referred to the Planning and Zoning Committee an application from Bruce Czarnecki to construct a garage of 30 feet by 50 feet by 17 feet at 227 Cary Road.\n— Approved the creation of a description for a recycling attendant job position, which is needed to get reimbursement from the county for someone that Hurley already employs.\nDuring public comment, Hurley resident Jean Ninefeldt requested that the annual Giving Tree project organized by Northern Iron County Engaged Residents be held indoors in order to reduce the potential for unintended litter.\nUntil now, the project has invited local citizens to pick up index cards on a tree and then donate Christmas gifts to children listed on the cards. Ninefeldt said that she is still picking up cards hung last year.\nCity clerk/treasurer Stacey Wiercinski said that the city already has communicated with NICER members about the issue.\nThe council’s next regular meeting will be on Aug. 12 at 5 p.m. in City Hall.",
