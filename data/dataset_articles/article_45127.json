  "text": "Nestled amongst the many bridges of Wayne, Alta., sits the sleepy Last Chance Saloon.\nThis end-of-the-road bar was once used as a set for the Jackie Chan movie Shanghai Noon — now it plays host to a three-day music and camping festival called Waynestock each summer.\nCelebrating its 11th anniversary, Waynestock will take place this Aug. 29 to 31, 2025, in the ghost town of Wayne, Alta.\nA haunted history Photo via Shutterstock It’s about a 15-minute drive southeast from Drumheller to Wayne, a sleepy former coal mining community that’s part of the Drumheller municipality.\nRumour has it, The Last Chance Saloon and neighbouring Rosedeer Hotel were built in 1913. And it’s not just the town that’s become ghostly — both buildings themselves are supposedly haunted .\nRosedeer Hotel is a popular destination for ghost hunters who might be hoping for a paranormal encounter. Themed rooms and wood-panelled walls give it a quaint, cozy atmosphere, while the hotel’s heritage status offers a charming glimpse into the history of the Wild West.\n“No one really likes coming up (to the third floor),” former owner of the hotel and the saloon, Fred Dayman, told the Calgary Herald in an interview in 1998. “People say they feel like someone is watching them.”\nAn overnight festival in Badlands country Photo via Last Chance Saloon While bookings for the Rosedeer Hotel during Waynestock are only accepted by phone call or email, the rugged desert surroundings and nearby Dinosaur Provincial Park provide plenty of camping options for tourists looking to hit up the summer festival.\nThe hotel’s nearby campsite also provides Wi-Fi, an on-site bar, and restaurant amenities. The destination stop is perfect for RV trips or adventurous types looking to camp out in the badlands.\nA top-notch lineup of musical acts spans almost every genre. At Waynestock, you’ll experience exceptional blues, roots, rock, bluegrass, alternative and soul music in the heart of Dinosaur Valley.\nWith three stages and secluded natural views, it’ll be a truly unforgettable experience. You might even catch a glimpse of a ghost or two.\nWaynestock When: Aug. 29 to Sept. 1, 2025\nWhere: 555 Jewell St., Drumheller\nCost: $35 to $165\nPurchase here",
