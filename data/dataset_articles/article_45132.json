Since this upcoming month is the last FULL month of summer, we need to make the most of it. The season slipped us by, didn’t it? But let’s not dwell on that for long; there is still tons of time to enjoy some of the best summer vibes along scenic road trips in Ontario.\nA long drive in the country sounds like a great idea, and luckily, Ontario is blessed with stunning landscapes, so why not go on one of these road trips and explore all the beauty our province has to offer?\nAnd while you’re at it, check out the nearby townships and cities and grab yourself a little souvenir. You never know what you’ll come across!\nMost scenic road trips you can take in Ontario Algonquin Provincial Park Looking for a long road trip? We promise that the ride to Algonquin is worth it. The drive to the park alone is enough to take your breath away, and it only becomes more beautiful once you enter the grounds, in any season.\nWhere: Ontario Highway 60\nBoreal Driving Route Described as “a region that many Canadians will never see, yet offers so much in terms of history, culture, and natural wonder,” according to Ontario Parks , this is a part of the province that is worth exploring.\nCanada’s Boreal Forest is so vast that it affects the health of the environment worldwide.\nThere are eight stops on this route, which starts in the northern city of Sudbury. Some destinations are a shorter drive than others, but the breathtaking sights you’ll see are worth every kilometre.\nWhere : View the map here\nElgin County Route Ontario’s southwest is home to Canada’s only Carolinian Forests, named after the U.S. Carolinas because of the region’s similar landscapes and climate.\nThere are over 100 km of forests to explore in Elgin County, and this two-hour driving route will take you on a tour of the best that this area has to offer. You’ll make pit stops in adorable towns and villages, including the colourful Port Stanley , described as “Ontario’s hidden jewel.”\nWhere: Highway 401 at Graham Road\nForks of the Credit This classic scenic drive is a must for your road trip plans. The road is full of twists, turns, and gorgeous views of the nearby provincial park. Plus, it’s right in Peel Region, so you won’t have to venture very far out of the city to experience it.\nYou’ll want to pay a visit to the many local conservation areas and the nearby town of Belfountain for a light bite. It’s the perfect activity for a peaceful Sunday afternoon.\nWhere: Forks of the Credit Road, Caledon, Ont.\nGeorgian Bay Coastal Route Nothing beats the stunning views as you drive past some of the world’s largest freshwater beaches.

This 40 km route begins right off of Highway 401 in Gananoque and takes you along the St. Lawrence River.\nThere are so many fun stops to make on this road trip, but you can still enjoy the breathtaking landscapes without leaving your car.\nThere’s even a 4,500 ft suspension bridge that takes you right to the U.S. Wellesley Island, with gorgeous views along the way.\nWhere: Highway 401, Exits 647 to 685\nEnjoy the great outdoors Ontario is known for!",
