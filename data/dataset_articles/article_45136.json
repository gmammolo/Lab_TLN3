  "text": "Regional band ‘Angelus’ are on a mission to bring small community halls back to life by hosting shows throughout the Goulburn Murray area.\nHold tight - we’re checking permissions before loading more content\nThe band consists of Rushworth’s Lou Costa, Shepparton’s Emma King and Colbinabbin’s Julie Price.\nWhile they have been a trio for about a year now, before they became Angelus, Ms Costa and Ms Price were a duo for 10 years.\nMs Price said they were inspired to bring the shows to regional towns after taking part in the Festival of Small Halls Tour.\n“How it came about is that our trio were asked to play at the small halls tour,” she said.\n“One of the halls was Karramomus... 80 people turn up to that, like in the middle of nowhere, and we just thought, there's all these little halls around, why are we waiting to be invited to play somewhere?\n“We just decided we'd start making our own gigs.”\nMs Price added that it was also a chance to make use of small halls that could be closed down if not made the most of.\n“It's also about making use of these halls; otherwise they're just going to rack and ruin... it's a case of use it or lose it really,” she said.\n“If they don't start getting used, they'll start getting closed down so it's a win-win situation — we get somewhere to play and hopefully people come and watch and the hall gets used.”\nAngelus is a folk trio, with each member playing keys, cello or guitar, while blending their voices on both original songs and covers.\nThe group will be joined by Lou Walsh from Tongala and Mark Osmond from Shepparton, the Maple and Murray duo.\nThe shows will run as mini concerts where guests can sit down and enjoy the performances.\nPerformances will be about 40 minutes each, with an old-fashioned afternoon tea to break up the acts.\nMs Price said while all were welcome to the shows, it especially catered to those who prefer a more relaxed environment to enjoy music.\n“We have to invent, you know, create our own gigs because (we) just don't get the gigs, we're not a pub sort of band,” she said.\n“There's a whole demographic of 55 to 85-year-olds that we thought, they're the ones that will kind of enjoy that sort of music.\n“They're just Sunday afternoon concerts, designed to appeal to that demographic of people that don't go to pubs.”\nThe first show of the Winter Warmer Folk Concert will be held in Corop on Sunday, August 10 at the Corop Community Hall, followed by another show at the St Mary’s Parish Hall on Sunday, August 17 in Echuca.\nTickets are $26.50 for adults, $20 for concession and only $10 for children under 15 years old.\nTickets for the Corop show can be purchased at https://tinyurl.com/ywv646sk and tickets for the Echuca show can be found at https://tinyurl.com/5xcertwa\nTo keep up to date about future concerts, follow Angelus on Facebook at https://tinyurl.com/zb7c7vep",
