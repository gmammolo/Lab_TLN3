  "text": "The Federal Government has said it is strengthening security cooperation with the United States as part of efforts to protect lives, safeguard religious freedom and restore security across Nigeria.\nThis followed a plenary session of the Nigeria‚ÄìUS Joint Working Group on Nigeria‚Äôs designation as a Country of Particular Concern, held on Thursday at the Office of the National Security Adviser in Abuja.\nBriefing journalists after the meeting, the Minister of Information and National Orientation, Mohammed Idris, said the engagement reflected sustained efforts to deepen security partnerships and deliver concrete outcomes.\nIn a statement signed by his media aide, Rabiu Ibrahim, the minister said, ‚ÄúThis is the third high-level engagement with senior United States officials since November 2025. It shows that our partnership is active, serious and focused on outcomes that matter to Nigerians.\n‚ÄúThis bilateral partnership reflects not only our shared commitment to religious freedom and civilian protection, but also a mature strategic relationship grounded in trust, candour and shared responsibility,‚Äù he said.\nThe meeting was part of the US‚ÄìNigeria Joint Working Group and was co-chaired by the National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu, and the US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Allison Hooker.\nAccording to Idris, collaboration between both countries has translated into operational gains on the ground.\n‚ÄúOur military and security agencies are working closely with US partners through intelligence sharing and operational coordination, and have strengthened ongoing operations, including Operation Hadin Kai in the North-East and Operation Fasan Yamma,‚Äù he said.\nHe disclosed that the US has committed to the timely delivery of outstanding military equipment procured over the past five years, including drones, helicopters, platforms, spare parts and support systems, and has also indicated its readiness to provide surplus defence equipment.\n‚ÄúWe want Nigerians to know that this partnership is working. These efforts are not abstract. They are yielding results, and they will continue to do so,‚Äù the minister said.\nOn domestic measures, Idris recalled that President Bola Tinubu had declared national security emergencies in vulnerable and high-risk areas, authorised intensified joint operations and directed the sustained deployment of security forces to priority locations.\n‚ÄúNigeria is acting decisively. Security agencies have clear instructions to protect communities and respond swiftly to threats,‚Äù he said.\nThe minister also said the Federal Government is strengthening early-warning systems and developing a national database to generate accurate and verifiable figures on deaths and casualties linked to violence.\n‚ÄúThis will give us a single, trusted source of data to guide decisions, improve accountability and sharpen our security response,‚Äù he explained.\nHe added that justice remains central to the government‚Äôs security strategy, noting that terrorism cases are being investigated and prosecuted.\n‚ÄúThe Ministry of Justice, the DSS and the Nigeria Police Force are actively investigating and prosecuting terrorism cases. Violence will not only be met with force, but with justice and accountability,‚Äù he said.\nIdris urged Nigerians to remain patient and supportive as reforms continue. ‚ÄúOur responsibility is to keep Nigerians informed and reassured. The work being done today is to ensure a safer country tomorrow,‚Äù he added.\nThe plenary session was attended by senior Nigerian officials, including the Minister of Defence, Gen. Christopher Gwabin Musa (retd); the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Olufemi Oluyede; the Minister of Budget and Economic Planning, Abubakar Bagudu; the Minister of State for Finance, Doris Uzoka-Anite; the Minister of Interior, Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo; the Inspector-General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun; and the Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Customs Service, Bashir Adeniyi.\nMembers of the US delegation included the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Allison Hooker; the Charg√© d‚ÄôAffaires, Keith Heffern; the Assistant Secretary of State, Riley Barnes; the Deputy Commander, AFRICOM, Lt Gen. John Brennan; Deputy Assistant Secretaries Bryan Ellis and Colby Jenkins; and the Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Regional Security, Greg Hermsmeyer, among others.\nThe partnership came amid heightened diplomatic tensions after US President Donald Trump redesignated Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern over alleged religious freedom violations, a move accompanied by threats of possible US military intervention.\nThe Federal Government has repeatedly dismissed claims of systemic Christian persecution, maintaining that insecurity affects citizens of all religious backgrounds.\nOn November 20, 2025, the US Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, hosted the NSA at the Pentagon for discussions on coordinated strategies to address the crisis.\nIn December, Ribadu announced that he had hosted a US congressional delegation in Abuja as part of ongoing security consultations between the two countries.\nAccording to the NSA, discussions during the meeting focused on ‚Äúcounter-terrorism cooperation, regional stability,‚Äù and ways to ‚Äústrengthen the strategic security partnership between Nigeria and the United States.‚Äù",
