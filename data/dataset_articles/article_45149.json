Credit Volonaut\nVolonaut Airbike brings science fiction through breakthrough technology, smart engineering, and bold design.\nThis vision led to the creation of a real, working speeder bike, something once only seen in sci-fi films.\n“Following the launch on April 30th, we are sharing this raw flight footage, including take-off and landing, all with real sound. No special effects, no CGI, no AI. Enjoy the future!”\nTomasz Patan, founder of Volonaut, in flight. Credit Volonaut\nAs the world’s first flying superbike, it’s built for those who crave speed and innovation. With its sleek, futuristic look and groundbreaking design, the Airbike isn’t just a new way to fly, it’s a whole new experience.\nIt stands for freedom, excitement, and the future of flight.\nsource Volonaut",
