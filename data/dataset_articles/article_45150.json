  "text": "Former NC Gov. Roy Cooper expected to announce US Senate run\nNORTH CAROLINA – Former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper could soon kick off a campaign for the US Senate. Sources tell us an official announcement is expected soon. It would give Democrats their top senate recruit ahead of the mid-term election next year.\nCooper served as governor for eight years before he was forced out by term limits at the end of 2024.\nWashington Democrats see North Carolina as a prime opportunity to flip a Republican seat after Senator Thom Tillis pulled out of running for a third term.",
