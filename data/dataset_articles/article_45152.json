  "text": "Idaho\n'We are united': Idaho governor issues statement after Kohberger is sentenced to life in prison\n5 hours ago\nIDAHO, USA — Idaho Governor Brad Little issued a statement on Wednesday afternoon after the man who killed four University of Idaho students was sentenced to life in prison. “Maddie Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapin are four beautiful souls Idahoans will never forget. Their tragic deaths broke the heart of Idaho. One by one, we heard their loved ones’ gut-wrenching statements at today’s sentencing hearing, and a theme emerged: we are united. We are united in healing, united in loving one another, and most of all, united in supporting the families and friends of Maddie, Kaylee, Xana, and Ethan, today and forever. I want to thank Idahoans for their strength. We will continue to move forward from this unspeakable tragedy together.\"",
