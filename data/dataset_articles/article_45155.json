  "text": "Sydney FC’s new striker has arrived, with Al Hassan Toure coming home to lead the line after three years abroad.\nToure returns to Australia to join the Sky Blues on a two-year deal following a stint with USL Championship outfit FC Tulsa, following spells in Turkey and France.\n“I am very happy and grateful to sign for such a big club. Sydney FC is a great club with great players, fans and history. I can’t wait to get started,” Toure said.\n“Being a player you are always looking to grow and improve everyday and I feel that Sydney FC has the environment, players, coaches to do so,” Toure continued.\n“Sydney FC has set a standard in the A-League for many years, It’s good to be part of such a successful club and I can’t wait to get out there in-front of the fans.”\nToure came through the Adelaide United system and made his debut in the FFA Cup in 2019 where he scored in every round of the cup, apart from the Semi Final, and walked away with the Mark Viduka Medal after scoring in the final.\nBorn in a refugee camp in Guinea, Al Hassan spent four years there and soon migrated to South Australia where he grew up playing football with his brothers Musa & Mohamed Toure who also came through the Adelaide United ranks.\nHe then made the switch to Macarthur where he again scored in the final and lifted the trophy for a second time after he did it with United at Coopers Stadium. Remarkably, Toure has never lost an Australian Cup game and has already won the trophy twice — a testament to his big-game mentality.\nSydney FC head coach Ufuk Talay is excited to see what Toure can bring to his side.\n“We’ve had an eye on Al Hassan for a bit as he is a quick, strong player and he will be able to give us plenty of versatility in the front third as we can deploy him as a striker and a winger,” Talay said.\n“He is very talented in a 1v1 situation and we believe he will help us break lines with his speed and the forward runs that he can provide us.\n“We are looking forward to bedding him into the squad and getting him ready for our cup clash against Western next week.”\nToure has already met his new team-mates and will wear number 35. He’ll be available for the Sky Blues’ upcoming Hahn Australia Cup clash against Western United on the 29th of July.",
