  "text": "Luke Bryan may be known for shaking his hips at his concerts, but fans got a little bit more than that when they attended his recent tour stop in Ohio. While seated at a piano at the Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, as part of his Country Song Came On Tour stop, the “I Don’t Want This Night To End” singer took a moment to deliver his best impression of hunky country cohort Riley Green . “This is my attempt to be Riley Green,” Bryan informed ticket holders before breaking into a fit of laughter, as he knew he may or may not do the impression justice. Bryan, who recently celebrated his 49th birthday, then began to run his fingers through his hair, and offered a few hair flips for good measure. He went on to pull up his shirt sleeve to flex his bicep, which resulted in a slew of cheering and screaming from the audience. “I get it,” Bryan says in a video shared via TikTok while placing his hands on the piano keys. “I get it. I would do him too, ladies. I would do him too.” As Bryan appeared to think about what he had just said, he turned toward the crowd further and pleaded, “Hey! Do not put that on TikTok, OK?” Of course, fans didn’t listen to those demands, as the video shared by one fan on social media has already received over 35k views, plus dozens of comments. “OMG, You got it! I’ve been waiting to find this,” one follower commented beneath the clip, with another person writing, “Too late. It’s on TikTok.” Green, 36, has not responded to Bryan’s hilarious impression. But judging by the clip, he’d probably have a good laugh. Related: Traditional Country Star’s Girlfriend Speaks Out Against Internet Backlash: 'I’m Human'",
