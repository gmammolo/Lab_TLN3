  "text": "The “before” and “after” photos from the North Ridgeville Police Department tell the story of ‘Project Beloved,’ a North Ridgeville Police Department recently completed effort to ease the trauma experienced by crime victims, particularly victims of sexual assault. The police department recently opened the “soft” interview room at its station on Ranger Way that is designed to offer a warmer, more comfortable atmosphere for victims as they are interviewed. The room’s renovation was sponsored by Project Beloved, a nonprofit dedicated to empowering sexual assault survivors. The room has comfortable furnishings and thoughtful decor, including wall art of photos taken by a sexual assault survivor. To learn more about Project Beloved and its work with police departments, go to projectbeloved.org.\nFeatured\nNORTH RIDGEVILLE: Police room redone to benefit crime victims\nPost a comment as anonymous\nReport\nWatch this discussion.
