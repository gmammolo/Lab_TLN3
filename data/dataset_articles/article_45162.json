  "text": "ALMOND Vosotros performed another notable game for TNT in the PBA 49th Season Philippine Cup finals, but this time, it resulted to a win.\nVosotros stepped up with the Tropang 5G going deep into their arsenal with 11 points, going 4-of-8 from the field in their 86-78 victory against San Miguel to stay alive in their title bid and Grand Slam search.\nREAD: TNT stands defiant, mauls SMB to extend PBA Finals to a Game Six\nIn TNT's Game 3 loss to the Beermen, the veteran gunner had 14 points while making 4-of-5 from threes.\nThis time, Vosotros made a significant impact in TNT's pullaway from SMB.\nAnd the former Triple Giga top gun’s efforts came at an opportune time, with his side losing another guard in Simon Enciso due to a fractured orbital bone back in Game 3.\n“Just the next man up,” coach Chot Reyes said about his fourth point guard now, after also already being without Jayson Castro and Rey Nambatac.\n“We’ve lost our top three point guards – our starting point guards. We’ve lost Jayson, Rey, and now Simon. Just next man up.”\nThe Tropang 5G actually expected such performance from Vosotros, who may be at the end of their rotation, but is armed with experience in different levels of basketball, being a two-time gold medalist in the Southeast Asian Games, a silver medalist in SEA Games 3x3, and a many-time local and international campaigner in the 3x3 circuit while playing for TNT Triple Giga.\n“We are fortunate that we were able to sign him late in the elimination round, so that gives us another option at this point,” said Reyes. “We all know his game. He is no stranger to big games. He’s had a lot of big games in his career both internationally and 3x3. He is just ready to deliver.”\nAlmond all good\nBeing ready is exactly what Vosotros did, as he took advantage of San Miguel’s defense focusing on TNT’s top weapons such as RR Pogoy.\n“Nag-umpisa ‘yan sa pasa ni Roger, kapag umaatake ‘yung ibang guards, talagang may nalilibre. Kailangan lang namin ng more patience sa offense,” said Vosotros.\n“’Yun naman lagi kong sinasabi, lagi ako nandito, wino-work out ko naman siya sa practice. Being ready lang talaga.”\nREAD: Vosotros makes compelling case to stay with TNT after contract ends next week\nWith Vosotros’ contributions, the Tropang 5G injected life into their title quest, slicing their margin to San Miguel to 2-3.\n“Lagi naman kami sinasabihan ni coach na hangga’t may pag-asa talaga, laban lang kami lagi. Hangga’t may opportunity na makabalik sa series, ‘yun lang ang focus namin,” said the 35-year-old Vosotros.\nGet more of the latest sports news & updates on SPIN.ph",
