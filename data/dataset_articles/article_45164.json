  "text": "The Guardians dispatched the Orioles to win their fourth in a row and eleventh of thirteen, 3-2 tonight.\nSlade Cecconi continues to be a model of consistency, going six innings and allowing only two runs. If he can figure out how to avoid a few more solo home runs... watch out.\nThe Guardians needed only four hits and two walks to win this game. Kyle Manzardo had a 2 RBI single, driving in Kwan who had walked and Jose Ramirez who had doubled:\nand Steven Kwan knocked in Bo Naylor who had doubled:\nThe bullpen was nails tonight featuring scoreless innings from Nic Enright, Hunter Gaddis and Emmanuel Clase. Stephen Vogt, please note that Enright > > > Matt Festa in the circle of trust. Clase looked especially electric, striking out two:\nIf they trade him (I don't think they will), it better be for the sun, moon and stars.\nBrayan Rocchio also made a sensational diving catch, doing his best Superman pose for Superman night at Progressive Field. It's great that Rocchio's defense looks all the way back to his excellent 2024 form since his return:\nThe Guardians and Orioles will wrap things up tomorrow afternoon, with a rare chance at a series mop for Cleveland. On goes the team’s frantic attempt to prove they deserve the front office's belief at this trade deadline. Tonight was a great step in that direction, in front of a great crowd.",
