  "text": "Schools\nNew Pediatric Nursing Scholarship at Quinnipiac University\nOn the 18th Anniversary of the Cheshire Home Invasion Murders: New Pediatric Nursing Scholarship at Quinnipiac University Honors Legacy\nPress release\nNew Pediatric Nursing Scholarship at Quinnipiac University Honors Legacy of Jennifer Hawke-Petit\nHAMDEN - A new endowed scholarship at Quinnipiac University’s School of Nursing will honor the life and legacy of Jennifer Lynn Hawke-Petit, a dedicated pediatric nurse who with her daughters, Hayley and Michaela, were the victims of a brutal triple-murder in their Cheshire home on July 23, 2007.\nThe Petit Family Foundation has established the Jennifer L. Hawke-Petit Pediatric Nursing Scholarship with a $100,000 gift, announced by Foundation President Dr. William A. Petit, Jr. Quinnipiac University will match the gift by 50%, creating a lasting source of support for nursing students with financial need who share Hawke-Petit’s commitment to pediatric care.\nNamed in honor of his late wife, Petit said Quinnipiac was a natural choice for the scholarship.\n“I felt it was a chance to align with a high-quality nursing program, and that this was a good opportunity and time to do that,” Petit said. “Jennifer loved pediatric nursing with a passion, and I thought it would be nice to help out others interested in that area who are studying at Quinnipiac.”\nA member of the Quinnipiac School of Nursing Advisory Council, Petit praised the leadership of School of Nursing Dean Larry Z. Slater and said the program’s quality made it the right home for the scholarship.\nSlater noted that the scholarship addresses an urgent need in health care.\n“The current nursing workforce shortage has also significantly impacted pediatric care, as demonstrated by expanding pediatric vacancies that lead to longer wait times, be it in pediatric hospital settings or in primary care,” said Slater. “The Jennifer L. Hawke-Petit Pediatric Nursing Scholarship will assist the Quinnipiac University School of Nursing in addressing the shortage. The financial assistance, along with the school's commitment to building nurse leaders of the future, will allow us to significantly impact children across the care continuum.”\nThroughout her career, Hawke-Petit was known for her warmth, collaborative spirit, and deep commitment to patient care. Lisa M. Rebeschi, senior associate dean of the School of Nursing at Quinnipiac, said the scholarship carries deep personal meaning.\n“As a student, I had a clinical placement on a pediatric unit Jennifer managed,” Rebeschi said. “I clearly remember the feeling of wanting to be a pediatric nurse just like her.”\nRebeschi later worked alongside Hawke-Petit at Yale New Haven Hospital and said she inspired countless nursing staff with her professionalism and grace.\n“Jennifer loved taking care of kids, but she also loved teaching,” said Petit. “She was a team player who made everyone feel part of the team.”\nThe Petit Family Foundation, established in 2007, supports causes that reflect the interests and values of Hawke-Petit and the couple’s late daughters, Hayley and Michaela.\n“If you could train even one person a year, and they have a 25-year career, they can impact a lot of people. You get a big multiplier effect,” Petit said. “We hope to continue this scholarship with support from the Petit Family Foundation, from Quinnipiac University, and from others interested in supporting pediatric nursing.”\nSlater said the university is honored to help preserve Hawke-Petit’s legacy.\n“We are grateful to the Petit Family Foundation for supporting the future of pediatric nursing in honor of Jennifer,” Slater said. “Her legacy will continue to inspire our students as they pursue their passion to serve our communities' children.”",
