  "text": "Winter Greyhound Adoption Event at BrewDog South Eveleigh\nMeet-and-greet a potential snuggle buddy that needs a new home, plus wear your PJs to score discounted food and drinks.\nOverview\nGet ready to meet your dream tail-wagging pal at BrewDog South Eveleigh, as the crew partners with Greyhounds As Pets NSW (GAP NSW) for a Greyhound Adoption Day on Saturday, July 26. Running from 11am–2pm, this is your chance to take a greyhound from shelter to snuggles.\nAbout 30 adorable greyhounds will be up for adoption on the day. These rapid couch potatoes make dog ownership a breeze, with their gentle, affectionate and sleepy personalities perfect for apartment dwellers and families. Plus, you won't have to worry about huge piles of hair, non-stop barking or doggy smell taking over your space.\nBest of all, the adoption process is super simple. Just head along to the pub to meet-and-greet the doggos. If there's a match to be made, the team can approve an on-the-spot adoption, complete with a discounted rate. A standard adoption is $150 (down from $250), while a sweet senior of seven years or older is half the usual rate at $75.\nJust realise that saying no will be almost impossible. Bringing the winter vibes, each greyhound will be styled in colourful Kazoo pyjamas, ensuring a cuteness overload. Meanwhile, BrewDog South Eveleigh is offering ten percent off food and drink to anyone who arrives in their own PJs. By the time you're heading home, you might just have someone new to cuddle on the couch.",
