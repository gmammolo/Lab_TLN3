  "text": "Barry Boyd can fly through the air, scale vertical surfaces and perform dozens of other feats that would leave most mere mortals stunned.\nBoyd isn’t a superhero, however—he’s a ninja.\nAfter earning the chance to test his skills on the hit reality game show American Ninja Warrior (ANW)—or simply “Ninja,” as Boyd and his fellow competitors call it—Boyd, 28, has spent the past several years climbing the ranks and wowing audiences with his ability to take on an ever-evolving array of challenges designed to push athletes to their limits.\nSumming up the experience, even to fans of the show, can be tough.\n“It’s so unique, and requires such a different set of skills,” says Boyd, who likes to describe Ninja as a blend of many different sports. Sports like rock climbing are especially helpful for grip control, he explained, but oftentimes success in Ninja simply comes down to “how well you can control your body.”\nThat level of body control is what allows ANW athletes to conquer challenges that look physically impossible. In the Spider Wall Jump, for example, competitors must jump off a mini-trampoline, wedge themselves between two parallel walls using their hands and feet, and navigate the space between the walls. In the Bridge of Blades, they must run across four perpendicular panels that rotate simultaneously when stepped on.\nCompeting on ANW obviously requires tremendous physical strength and agility. What some people might not realize, Boyd says, is the extent to which the athletes must rely on mental toughness.\n“Almost the entire thing comes down to the mental part,” says Boyd. “Are you willing to keep going?”\nFor Boyd, who recently moved from Powhatan to North Chesterfield, that mental fortitude was developed long before he ever set foot in a Nina gym.\nGrowing up in Pennsylvania, Boyd and several of his siblings spent time in the foster care system, an experience Boyd says continues to shape his outlook to this day. Because of his experience, Boyd says, he hopes he and his wife Mercedes, who he met at a Bible study when both attended California University Pennsylvania, can someday become foster parents.\nFor now, the stay-at-home dad to two young sons is remaining focused on training and on his family, both the one at home and the one he has found through ANW.\n“The Ninja community really holds each other up,” says Boyd. “We’re a family, just constantly motivating each other.”\nAs for his advice to others who might find themselves watching American Ninja Warrior and wondering if they can compete, Boyd says his best advice is to just go for it.\n“There is no one perfect way,” Boyd says. “And there is no such thing as ‘you can’t do it.”\nAmerican Ninja Warrior, now in its seventeenth season, airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on NBC.",
