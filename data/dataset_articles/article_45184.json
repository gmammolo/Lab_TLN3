  "text": "Webster, N.Y. — Our Bright Spot shines on the Webster Rotary Club celebrating Ross Willink's 100th birthday during a luncheon Wednesday.\nRoss is a U.S. Navy veteran who served in World War II before becoming a longtime Rotarian.\nHe also served as the superintendent of schools for the Webster Central School District, even having the Thomas Middle School renamed after him.\nRoss said he's proud of the many accomplishments he's been able to take part in through the club.\n\"It's a pleasure to work with so many people on so many different topics, including the Camp Haccamo and Sunshine Camp, and all of the kids we've been able to work with,\" he said.\n\"If you live like a Rotarian, you live a pretty good life,\" Ross added.\nOur friend, longtime 13WHAM anchor Don Alhart, attended Wednesday's luncheon to celebrate with Ross.\n_____",
