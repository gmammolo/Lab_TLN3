  "text": "Rochester, N.Y. — The Freedom Scholars Learning Center organized a demonstration in downtown Rochester today as part of the National Day of Social Action.\nThe event, themed \"Public Education is Public Good,\" aimed to highlight the impact of policies that uplift students and address necessary reforms and investments at all levels.\n\"It always starts with the children, right? The children are the focal point, the children are the voices and sometimes at many tables, their perspectives are not there,\" said Freedom Scholars Executive Director Jeremy Smith. \"So at Freedom Schools, we always make sure that that perspective is always to the forefront, especially when it comes to civil responsibility.\"\nThe event also featured original student work, including poetry, songs, and speeches focused on the themes of self-discovery, banned books, and educational access.\n___",
