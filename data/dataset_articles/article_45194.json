  "text": "Seven-time singles Grand Slam winner Venus Williams is single no more. Though long-rumored to be engaged to Andrea Preti, Venus subtly confirmed the news in an interview with WTA, Today reported. Following her first match in more than a year at the Mubadala Citi DC Open, Venus let the news slip. While she didn’t mention Andrea by name, it was pretty clear who she was talking about.\nVideos by InspireMore\n“My fiancé is here and he really encouraged me to keep playing,” she said.\nVenus Williams Wanted To Impress Andrea Preti\nVenus Williams told WTA having Andrea Preti in the stands helped motivate her to win.\n“There were so many times where I just wanted to coast and kind of chill,” she said. “Do you know how hard it is to play tennis? You guys don’t know how much work goes into this, like it’s 9 to 5 except you’re running the whole time, lifting weights, and just like dying, and then you repeat it the next day. So he encouraged me to get through this, and it’s wonderful to be here. He’s never seen me play.”\nEarly in July, Venus opened up to Today about her health struggles and stepping back from tennis.\n“Fibroids impacted my career,” she explained. “I never had enough energy most times to play a real match the way I wanted to, and, of course, it affected my results.”\nThankfully, she found a new team of doctors who helped her heal. Venus Williams opened up about her health, hoping to reach other women with similar struggles.\n“Hopefully someone will see this interview and say, ‘I can get help. I don’t have to live this way,’” Venus said. “I’m very passionate about this at this point in time because I know that other people can live better than what I lived.”\nThis story’s featured image is by Scott Taetsch/Getty Images.\nWant to be happier in just 5 minutes a day?
