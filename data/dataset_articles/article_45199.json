  "text": "LAHAINA (HawaiiNewsNow) - Men on Maui are working to raise awareness about mental health ahead of the two-year anniversary of the Lahaina wildfires.\nKane Connections has been supporting men on Maui and Molokai for the past decade.\nThe group of men, along with S.O.S. (Survivors of Suicide loss), are holding a sign waving event in front of Lahaina Cannery Mall on Thursday, July 24th from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.\nThey are calling everyone to come down and help them raise awareness about mental health and suicide prevention.\n“The continued mental health issues that we see personally with our participants that come to our groups affected by the fire, the PTSD, the depression, the anxiety from it, it’s needed sorely in Lahaina,” said Ryan Smith, a parent support specialist with Kane Connections.\nSmith was homeless living in Puamana during the disaster. He says Hui Kane or the men’s group with Maui Family Support Services helped save his life.\n“I wouldn’t have met the people that I know today. I wouldn’t have the job I have today, giving back to the community,” he said.\nAfter the sign waving event, the men’s group will met at the Lahaina Comprehensive Health Center from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.\nIt is free for any kane looking for connection.\n“I implore anybody that’s going through anything that they might be spinning on, or any stressors they might have coming up, or going through currently, come check us out. That’s all we ask. Just come check us out once and I promise you, it will be worth it,” Smith said.\nHopsing Coon can also testify about the group’s success. He fell into depression after the fires and lost his business.\n“Because all the anxiety and depression, stress,” he said. “I was luau photographer and always chasing the dollar because that’s Maui. So, I had a heart attack about 15 months ago.”\nThey want men who may be suffering to know they are not alone.\n“Knowing that there’s other men that care about you helps. It really does,” said Coon.\nFor more information, call (808) 793-2816.\nCopyright 2025 Hawaii News Now. All rights reserved.",
