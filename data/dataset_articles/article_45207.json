  "text": "Arkansas Governor’s School is being held this month on the campus of Arkansas Tech. 365 students from across the state are attending this year. All students have three classes a day, Monday-Friday, as well as special presentations, speakers and movies. The snake talk is always popular!\nOn Saturdays, various groups visit local sites, for example the Bona Dea trails, Lake Dardanelle State Park, Downtown Russellville, trail maintenance on Mount Nebo, and water polo at the Aquatic Center. Weekend evenings are for social events, such as the SummerWeen costume party. See another photo on A2.",
