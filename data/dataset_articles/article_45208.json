  "text": "India’s passport has significantly improved in the global mobility ranking, moving up 8 spots to rank 77th on the Henley Passport Index released on July 22.\nThis is the biggest jump by any country in this year’s index.\nIndia Makes Biggest Leap in 2024 Henley Passport Index, Climbs to 77th Rank\nIndian passport holders now have visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 59 destinations.\nPopular Asian countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Maldives, and Thailand are included in this list.\nCountries like Sri Lanka, Macau, and Myanmar offer visa-on-arrival, depending on the purpose and duration of travel.\nThis gain follows a five-spot drop last year, indicating a recovery in India’s global travel access.\nDespite this improvement, Indian passport holders still face more travel limitations compared to those from top-ranking countries.\nThe Henley Passport Index is a widely respected measure that ranks passports based on how many countries allow entry without a pre-arranged visa.\nThis year’s rankings reflect a stronger Asian presence at the top, with Singapore leading by offering visa-free access to 193 destinations.\nJapan and South Korea Secure Top Passport Ranks with Access to 190 Countries\nJapan and South Korea follow closely, with access to 190 countries each, showcasing the benefits of steady diplomatic relationships.\nDr. Christian H. Kaelin, creator of the passport index, remarked that the rankings highlight how “global access depends on sustained diplomacy and international relationships.”\nThe United Arab Emirates has seen notable progress, rising from 42nd to 8th over the past decade.\nChina has also climbed, moving from 94th in 2015 to 60th this year, aided by efforts to provide visa-free access in South America and the Gulf.\nAmong European nations, seven EU countries — Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Spain — are tied at third place, with access to 189 destinations.\nAnother group, including Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden, ranks fourth, allowing travel to 188 countries.\nAt the bottom of the list, Afghanistan remains in last place, with visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to just 25 countries, reflecting a 168-country gap from the top-ranking passport.\nTraditional leaders like the United States and United Kingdom have declined in the rankings, now at 10th and 6th place, respectively.\nThese shifts are attributed to changing diplomatic dynamics and the rise of new global alliances.\nCitizens of the U.S. and UK are increasingly exploring second passports or migration options to maintain global travel freedom.\nWhile India’s passport ranking improvement may not dramatically change travel routines right away, it reflects a positive long-term trend.\nThe upward movement suggests that more countries may open their doors to Indian travelers in the future.",
