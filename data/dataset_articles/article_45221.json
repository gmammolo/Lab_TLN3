  "text": "We’re Back!\nGov. Abbott has called a special session for the 89th Texas Legislative Session, which began Monday, July 21, and will end in 30 days! This is a powerful opportunity to keep advancing pro-life and pro-family legislation!\nIn our last legislative update, we celebrated two major victories:\nSB 31 – Life of the Mother Act: Clarifies when abortions are prohibited and protects both women and medical professionals.\nSB 33: Shuts down transactions and logistical support between governmental entities and abortion providers or assistance groups.\nAs we celebrate these victories, we still have another important pro-life and pro-woman bill to consider in this special session – and we need your help!\nSB 6 – Woman and Child Protection Act\nWe thank Gov. Abbott for hearing our voice, as CWA of Texas was one of the 130 signatures on a letter to include this bill. This bill would:\n- Strengthen pro-life laws in Texas by expanding civil enforcement mechanisms of the Texas Heartbeat Act\n- Target trafficking, distribution, and facilitation of abortion-inducing drugs\nOnce again, we will be calling on legislators in both chambers to support this bill!\nACTION: Please contact the members of the Senate State Affairs Committee and ask them to vote this bill out of committee. Be sure to let them know that you are being updated by Concerned Women for America of Texas.\nThe clock is ticking! This bill must move through committees and both chambers before the 30-day session ends.\nPRAY: Please pray for this bill to be considered by the respective committees and brought to the floor for a vote. Pray that God would give our legislators the wisdom and understanding to accomplish His purposes.\nWe anticipate the introduction of other important bills during this session, so please stay tuned for updates.\nThank you for continuing to stand with us!",
