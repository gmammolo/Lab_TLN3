  "text": "ALBERT LEA, Minn. — The Albert Lea Police Department (ALPD) says it played a crucial role in the safe recovery of Brynlee Nelson, a 7-year-old girl who was the subject of an AMBER Alert issued by the Sherburne County Sheriff’s Office.\nBrynlee was last seen on Wednesday afternoon near 26000 block of 13th Street West in Zimmerman. At the time, she was wearing a black jacket, white boots, and blue snow pants. She also had a backpack adorned with keychains and trinkets.\nA black vehicle was noticed near the area following Brynlee's school bus, though its connection to her disappearance was unclear. Early Thursday morning, Albert Lea Police say they received a tip about a vehicle on Interstate 35 linked to the AMBER Alert.\nOfficers conducted a traffic stop in Albert Lea, confirming Brynlee was inside the vehicle. Joseph Andrew Bragg, a 28-year-old from Maple Grove, was taken into custody. Brynlee was taken to Mayo Clinic Health System in Albert Lea for evaluation and later reunited with her family.\nPolice say the incident underscores the importance of public awareness and swift interagency coordination during AMBER Alerts. The ALPD was supported by the Freeborn County Sheriff’s Office and Mayo Ambulance Service.\nFor further details, contact the Sherburne County Sheriff’s Office.",
