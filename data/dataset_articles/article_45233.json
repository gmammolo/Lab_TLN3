  "text": "This post was originally published on here\nAssistant Professor Dr Nattapong Punnoi from Chulalongkorn University’s Social Design Lab cited Japan’s Setouchi Islands as inspiration, where mobility data helped transform a deserted fishing community into a contemporary art destination.\n“This cluster-based tourism strategy enables all stakeholders to see the industry through a new lens,” he said.\nDuring a panel discussion entitled “Thailand’s Tourism Industry Future: Challenges and Opportunities,” industry experts outlined the strategic shift in thinking.\nWatcharee Churugsa from the Designated Areas for Sustainable Tourism Administration noted that Thailand’s previous approach had been overly focused on demand generation whilst neglecting supply-side considerations.\n“Thailand previously focused on marketing to promote the country in order to attract more tourists. However, we disregard the supply side, resulting in overtourism,” she explained.\nShe stressed that leveraging mobility data through partnerships between technology, private sector, and civil society could improve tourism in terms of “inclusion, sustainability, and economic benefit to the local community as well as community wellness.”\nThe government is also exploring medical tourism opportunities, with Dr Komgrit encouraging collaboration around the Whole Genome Sequencing Centre to create personalised tourism experiences.\nHe advocated for creating “a single large medical tourism platform that made extensive use of the Whole Genome Sequencing Centre,” emphasising that genomic data could help capture niche markets and personalise tourist preferences for both Thai and international visitors.\n“With a platform that supports authenticating data, you can undoubtedly bring value to the Thai tourism business, such as medical, wellness, and spa,” Dr Komgrit explained. “This would allow us to standardise and certify our tourism services to a higher level, and the connected firms that can be included on the platform will be the standard and trusted ones.”\nAssistant Professor Supawadee Phothiyarach , Senior Expert at NXPO, reinforced the importance of translating research into practical business applications.\nShe highlighted that data-driven approaches could help Thailand advance “in becoming a tourism destination for all, including both demand and supply sides.”\nTwo additional routes are scheduled to launch soon as part of The Cloud Journey: Routes to Roots initiative , with detailed information available through The Cloud platform.",
