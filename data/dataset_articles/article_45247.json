  "text": "Mississippi University for Women will launch a Bachelor of Science in Early Childhood Education in fall 2025, designed to prepare students for licensure as pre-K educators.\n“The shift from a non-licensure model to a licensure-track program directly addresses Mississippi’s urgent need for early childhood educators,” said Dr. Martin Hatton, dean of the School of Education. “Given both statewide and national trends, we anticipate strong demand and have designed the program to meet that need.”\nOffered through The W’s School of Education, and formerly known as Early Childhood Development, the program emphasizes classroom management, developmentally appropriate curriculum and instructional methods tailored to young learners. Aligned with the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) Professional Preparation Standards, the curriculum also focuses on foundational knowledge and evidence-based practices for teaching children from birth through age eight.\nWhile not only providing specialized training to prepare educators to create engaging, high-quality learning environments that support young children’s growth and development, educators will be equipped to engage the community and family.\nThrough The W’s Child & Parent Development Center (CPDC)—a laboratory preschool on campus specializing in early learning and care—students gain valuable hands-on experience before entering the workforce. Students will also have opportunity to gain field experiences in other settings, including public schools and child care facilities in their local communities.\nStudents in the Early Childhood Education program may choose either a licensure or non-licensure path, depending on their career goals. Those pursuing licensure will complete the required state exams upon graduation.\nAll program content will be available online, offering students a flexible and affordable path to their degree.\n“This new degree in Early Childhood Education provides a licensure-track program that unifies all of our early childhood initiatives, including opportunities to participate in parent enrichment programming offered through the Child & Parent Development Center,” Hatton said. “The demand for licensed early childhood educators is high, yet few education programs in Mississippi lead to MDE licensure in this field. Importantly, well-prepared early childhood educators are essential to the workforce needs of our state.”\nLicensure of the program was approved Thursday, July 17 by the State Board of Education.\nTo apply for the Early Childhood Education program or other academic offerings at The W, please visit muw.edu/admissions.\nAbout School of Education\nThe W’s School of Education is dedicated to education from early childhood through post-graduation, and it fosters excellence through teacher preparation, professional development and community engagement. Its programs empower educators and learners to grow, lead and make a lasting impact across the region.",
