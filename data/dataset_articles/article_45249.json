  "text": "Chennai Couple Spends Rs 70,000 A Month To Raise Baby. Here’s How Much They Save\nThe couple, who earn ₹78,000 per month, spend ₹46,500 on rent and daycare alone.\nManaging finances while raising a child can be incredibly challenging, especially with a limited income and no additional support. A Chennai-based couple recently shared how they navigate their monthly expenses while caring for their 8.5-month-old baby on a combined income of ₹78,000. They revealed that they made a conscious decision to rent a safe home located close to a reputable daycare for their daughter.\nAs a result, they spend ₹46,500 each month on rent and daycare alone. Despite the steep cost, the couple believes these essentials are non-negotiable when it comes to their child’s safety and well-being.\nRecommended Stories\nIn a now-deleted Reddit post, the couple said, “We are a couple living in Chennai with a combined monthly income of Rs 78,000 (after tax). We have an 8.5-month-old baby, and we’ve chosen a good daycare and a safe rental house very close to it. We chose them with utmost care because our baby is very small and we want to ensure safety, cleanliness, and proximity.\"\nAfter spending most of their monthly income on rent and daycare, they then use around Rs 10,000 for food, including groceries, fruits, vegetables and milk. They spend Rs 8,500 on travel, which includes auto rides, metro and petrol. Baby diapers cost them another Rs 3,000. For electricity and gas, they pay Rs 1,000 each. All these regular expenses cost Rs 70,000 every month. This leaves them with just Rs 8,000 at the end, which they try to keep aside for savings or any emergency.\nThe couple shared that they don’t get any help from their families as they got married without their approval. Now, the wife is trying to find part-time or online work that she can do from home. She only has one free hour each day, so she is looking for something that fits into that time frame.\nIn another such example, Meenal Goel, a startup founder from Bengaluru, spoke about how expensive it has become to raise a child in Indian cities. She said that the total cost of raising a child in today’s time can go up to Rs 45 lakh. Meenal pointed out that many parents are finding it hard to handle added expenses, especially in metro cities where everything, from school fees to basic daily needs, costs more than before.\nAbout the Author\nBuzz Staff\nvideos, and memes, covering quirky incidents, social media\nbuzzfrom\nindiaand around the world, Also Download the\nNews18 Appto stay updated!\n- Location :\n- First Published:\nTerms of Useand\nPrivacy Policy.",
