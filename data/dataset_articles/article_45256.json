  "text": "PITTSBURG, Kan. (KOAM) -- As the summer baseball season continues across the country, one Pittsburg team is a step closer to playing in the Little League World Series.\nThe Pittsburg 12 and Under All-Stars team is heading to Indianapolis for the Little League Midwest Regional Tournament after winning the Kansas state tournament and finishing an undefeated record.\nWith this Pittsburg squad preparing for new competition, their mentality is shifting as they are now representing something that is bigger than themselves.\n\"As you go in these tournaments, things get bigger and better,\" head coach Russ Wachter says. \"You got from representing yourself and your family in league, then you represent your city in Pittsburg. Now, we get to represent our state in Kansas. Honestly, we couldn't be more proud of the stages that we've gone through and proud of the team that we have and the way that we've represented each one of us. Each one of those things; your family, yourself, your city, and your state. Those are all things that we take very seriously and we love to death.\"\nThe excitement is contagious as the All-Stars get ready to hit the road for Indianapolis next week with both the players and coaches ready to showcase their talents on the big stage.\n\"I'm really excited to go play in a new place and play with my team,\" outfielder Jace Cummings says. \"[We get to play] some more baseball and face new pitchers. It's also a little nerve wracking because the whole state of Kansas is watching us play.\"\n\"It's all you can really think about right now,\" Wachter adds. \"I never thought that I'd be thinking about baseball this much against in my life until I started coaching these kids again. They're a really good group of kids, and they're really anxious to go play. It's honestly kind of hard because we practice and practice and you got to go to work, and all you can think about is going up and playing your game, and trying to put your best foot forward. We're ready to go.\"\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 BY KOAM NEWS NOW. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. THIS MATERIAL MAY NOT BE PUBLISHED, BROADCAST, REWRITTEN OR REDISTRIBUTED.",
