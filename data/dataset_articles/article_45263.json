  "text": "GRANDFATHER MOUNTAIN — The 69th annual Grandfather Mountain Highland Games returned to Avery County’s MacRae Meadows July 10 to 13, drawing tens of thousands of spectators to celebrate Scottish culture amidst the scenic backdrop of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Over four full days, the event blended fiercely competitive athletics with spirited pageantry and ancestral traditions.\nMore than a hundred Scottish clans assembled on Thursday, each setting up tents adorned with tartan banners for the ceremonial “Calling of the Clans.” The torchlight ceremony, a glowing bonfire procession, then brought the Highland traditions to life as pipers led the clans into the evening air.\nThe Games showcased a range of Highland sports, from the iconic caber toss and sheaf toss to heavy hammer and weight throw contests. The games hosted divisions for “A” and “B” amateurs, professionals and Masters, with this year’s addition of an Elite Women’s Invitational Competition. Organizers hope to expand opportunities for women in the future.\nThe Caber Toss remains the most iconic event, as athletes aim to flip the log to land in the “12 o’clock” position, with style taking priority over distance.\nPiping and drumming bands filled the air, while internationally ranked highland dancers performed in official Atlantic Championship competitions. Attendees also enjoyed sheepdog herding exhibitions, Celtic concerts, including a Friday night rock jam and a lively Scottish country dance gala.\nThe 2025 Games were treated as a testament to what had happened last September in the High Country when Hurricane Helene swept through. Notably, the Games did not escape unscathed weather-wise during this year’s weekend, as heavy storms remained prevalent intermittently throughout the festival.\nGMHG President Steve Quillen praised the swift recovery following Hurricane Helene and the enduring community spirit, mentioning that the restored grounds looked “like Helene never showed up,” a testament to the dedication of the staff and volunteers.\n“I can’t express enough gratitude to all our staff and volunteers. Even with the torrential rain we had this weekend, the grounds held up exceptionally well,” said Quillen.\nThe 2025 Grandfather Mountain Highland Games once again delivered a memorable blend of athletic prowess, cultural pageantry, and hometown camaraderie. As tradition continues to echo through the valley, locals and visitors alike are already looking forward to next summer’s return to Scotland in the mountains.\nFor more information on the Games, click to www.gmhg.org.",
