  "text": "Facebook Twitter Bluesky WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save The Montana Jewish Project, a statewide community center headquartered in Montana’s first synagogue, held its third annual Pride Shabbat at the Temple Emanu-El in Helena.\nIn Jewish culture, Shabbat is known as the day of rest, lasting from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday. A key pillar of the Montana Jewish Project’s mission is inclusivity, and their Pride Shabbat celebrated the LGBTQ+ community.\nThe July 11 event was open to all with free admission, and about 50 guests attended. Drinks and appetizers were served on the synagogue’s lawn at 5 p.m., followed by Shabbat blessings, including candle lighting, prayer and kiddush, which involves a blessing said over a full cup of wine or grape juice to welcome Shabbat.\nGuests watch Erin Vang, who donned a prayer shawl and a kippah, lead the Pride Shabbat blessings on Friday.\nCourtesy, Montana Jewish Project “Traditionally, Jews growing up have only heard the word of God in Masculine Hebrew,” Julie Bir, board chair of the MJP, explained as Shabbat Blessing pamphlets were dispersed among the crowd. “We wanted to provide Shabbat blessings for all identities.”\nThe Blessing pamphlet included traditional masculine and feminine Hebrew, as well as a gender-neutral words developed by Jewish musician Emily Joy Goldberg.\nThe rainbow Challah from Helena bakery Dear Potato that was served at Friday night's Pride Shabbat.\nCourtesy, Dear Potato The food offered was from Dear Potato, a Helena bakery that specializes in Eastern European baking. They brought piroshkis — a savory pastry filled with meat — and rainbow-dyed challah, a braided bread served for ceremonies and special occasions in Jewish cuisine.\nThe Temple Emanu-El was completed in 1891 and was for a time the only synagogue between St. Paul, Minnesota, and Portland, Oregon. As the Jewish population in Helena steadily decreased, the building was sold to the state government in the 1930s. It was then purchased by the Catholic Diocese of Helena in the ‘80s, who sold the building to its current owners, the Montana Jewish Project, in 2022.\nA child and adult lounge Friday on the lawn of the Temple Emanu-El. One of the Shabbat blessings is a Blessing over the Children, which celebrates Jewish heritage and honors family connection.\nCourtesy, Montana Jewish Project “This temple is more than just a building. It’s a symbol of resilience and belonging,” Erin Vang, an avid member of MJP gatherings who led the Shabbat blessings on July 11, said during her introduction to the event.\nRebecca Stanfel is the executive director of the Montana Jewish Project, and Pride Shabbat is one of her favorite events of the year.\n“Our main goals are to connect Jewish people across Montana, and to uplift other minority groups in the state as they have a rich history here just like the Jewish community,” she said.\nDonna Andersen, an MJP board member and a New York native, is proud of the organization’s work.\n“I came from one of the largest Jewish communities in the country to an incredibly small one when I moved here three years ago,” the 27-year-old said. “But since joining the board in 2021, it’s been amazing to see how we can find people outside of Helena who are curious about the messages of Judaism.”\nGuests listen to the introduction of Friday night's Pride Shabbat event on the lawn of Temple Emanu-El.\nCourtesy, Montana Jewish Project In her conclusion of the Shabbat Blessing, Vang addressed an environment of hatred and division she felt was facing the LGBTQ+ community, which she is a part of. Her final blessing was the Shehecheyanu, one not traditionally said during Shabbat. But it is said as an acknowledgement of new beginnings.\n“Take this Shabbat as a time of rest, because when it ends, we have work to do,” she said.\nKaty McCumber is a news intern at the Helena Independent Record.\n0 Comments",
