  "text": "Next Article\nHow Justin Timberlake transformed from teen heartthrob to cultural icon\nVinita Jain\nWhat's the story\nHow did Justin Timberlake become a cultural icon in America?\nThe answer lies in his versatility and the fact that he did not restrict himself to being a singer.\nFrom the boy band he was a part of, to his Grammy award-winning solo career, Timberlake has always reinvented himself.\nHis influence surpasses music and goes to acting, fashion, and philanthropy.\nHere's how he became iconic.\nBoy band beginnings\nRise with 'NSync\nTimberlake rose to fame first as a member of the boy band 'NSYNC in the late 1990s. The group soon became one of the best-selling bands, with the likes of Bye Bye Bye and It's Gonna Be Me. Their success set the stage for Timberlake's future endeavors, proving his vocal prowess and charm. The band's popularity also gave him a loyal fan following that continued with him into his solo career.\nSolo stardom\nSuccessful solo career\nAfter 'NSYNC split, Timberlake started his solo career with the 2002 album Justified. From being critically-acclaimed to commercially successful, the album featured hits like Cry Me a River and Rock Your Body. His ability to infuse pop with R&B elements made him different from other artists of the time. Other albums established him as a front-runner in music.\nOn-screen success\nActing Ventures\nTimberlake also expanded his repertoire by trying his hand at acting. He starred in movies like The Social Network and Friends with Benefits, receiving accolades for his roles. His transition from music to the movies showed versatility that only a handful of musicians could manage. The move not only expanded his audience but also cemented his place as an all-around entertainer.\nStyle icon status\nInfluence on fashion\nBeyond music and acting, Timberlake has contributed heavily to fashion trends over the years. By blending classic styles with modern-day twists, he has been credited for influencing men's fashion choices across the globe. Collaborations with major brands further cemented this aspect of his persona, while keeping him relevant across different industries.\nGiving back\nPhilanthropic efforts\nApart from being an entertainer, Timberlake is also recognized for his philanthropic work towards other causes. This includes education programs through organizations such as the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open golf tournament. The event raises money every year, catering to children's healthcare requirements all over the country. Hence, it improves the public perception of him. This plays a major role in keeping him evergreen in America.",
