  "text": "This post was originally published on here\nBy Jena Carr\nA selection of short films from young filmmakers will be on display in the lead-up to the North Bellarine Film Festival (NBFF) later this year.\nThe free screening event of the festival’s previous films will be held at Boronggook Drysdale Library from 5.30pm on Wednesday, July 30, before the NBFF’s return in November.\nVice president Robert Walton said the screening event would feature a mixture of films from young filmmakers in different genres, including animated, comedy, drama, and documentary films.\n“Filmmaking is a really tough gig. You obviously go to university and, when you leave, there’s not really any jobs being advertised,” he said.\n“Many of these people are really independent, which is a passion. They have that creative thing inside them that makes them go on to be successful.\n“We’ve put together a collection of films which date back to 2020 and they were all finalists of the Emerging Filmmaker Award and Emerging Documentary Filmmaker Award.”\nThe event will feature a documentary titled Sink or Swim by filmmaker Brie Bartleet, which follows the story of Bree-Arne Manley, a Point Lonsdale resident with multiple sclerosis who continues to surf and make music.\n“I’ve done a couple other projects post this one and I just want to keep telling stories and shining light on incredible stories,” Ms Bartleet said.\n“I’ve got a disabled brother and I’m also a surfer, so meeting Bree and getting to shine a light on disability awareness while making a film around surfing was a dream project.”\nVisit trybooking.com/CZOAR for tickets and more information about the free film screening event.",
