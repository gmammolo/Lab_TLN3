  "text": "This post was originally published on here\nNEW JERSEY – The up-and-coming Greek-American actress Felice Kakaletris is set to star in the new film Rain Reign. From the age of six, Felice Kakaletris discovered her passion for performing and decided to get into acting.\nShe knew sports wasn’t for her, as she would always ‘mess up or drop the ball’ , acting , however, was something that came easy to her.\nIn an interview with The National Herald, Kakaletris revealed what inspired her to get into the entertainment industry so young. “I love to sing and act, dancing – not so much, but bringing characters to life is my favorite thing,” she told TNH. Her first role took place on a theatre stage at the Bergen Pac in Englewood, New Jersey, where she claimed the role of Grace Smythe in A Christmas Carol.\n“ From there, I was signed with two NYC talent agencies, and I have done shows with Tom Holland, Jessica Vosk , Taraji Henson, Ariane Debose, Cecily Strong and many more,” Kakaletris said.\n“I have been very lucky to learn from all these great actors and performers. I was also fortunate to have been invited to develop a new musical written by Paul Blake, the producer of The Carol King Musical on Broadway while working with some of my friends.”\nThe now 13-year-old, from Rutherford, New Jersey, with Greek roots from Karpathos and Sparta, has landed one of her biggest roles yet – the lead in the new film adaptation of Rain Reign, by Ann Martin.\nKakaletris explained what the film is all about, as well as what audiences can expect ahead of its release. “It follows Rose Howard, a 12-year-old neurodiverse girl who lives with her alcoholic father in an old house. The father is not very supportive of Rose and doesn’t really understand her,” she said.\n“Rose is very lonely, but one day her dad brings home a dog who Rose immediately falls in love with and becomes her best friend. Rose’s dad lets Reign out during a storm and she gets lost. That is when Rose had to find courage to search for her and overcome a lot of obstacles.”\nKakaletris said she initially auditioned for the role of Rose back in February earlier this year, and shortly after, received two callbacks, which were then followed by chemistry reads with her co-stars, Jeremy Sisto and Paul Rudd.\nShe expressed her experiences working alongside the two Clueless stars. “ Paul Rudd is so funny and kind. He immediately makes you feel like you know him for a long time, and I didn’t feel like he was a Hollywood celebrity. He is very down to earth and nice,” the young actress said.\n“Jeremy was also very nice , and I got very close to him since we had a lot more scenes together. Even though he plays a mean father in the movie, he was always very nice to me, and we had a fist pump secret move after each difficult time . During camera changes, he told me all about his animals, his band and a lot of jokes and made me feel so comfortable and safe around him.”\nFelice Kakaletris alongside her co-stars Jeremy Sisto and Paul Rudd.

It was a lot of work to be the lead in a film. I am in nearly all the scenes, and I had to memorize a lot of dialogue. After we started filming, I started learning my lines really fast , it became a habit,” Kakaletris said. “My trick was to read them and record them on the voice memo app on my phone and then listen to it at x3 speed while exercising or walking around. I learn faster by listening to audio rather than reading it.”\nFelice Kakaletris.

I am also neurodiverse, I am diagnosed with ADHD and generalized anxiety and I have a very good understanding of what Rose’s body and brain is going through when she is challenged and triggered,” Kakaletris said. I wanted to audition for this because I felt confident that I can authentically represent Rose in a way that is real and raw.”\nFelice Kakaletris said she looks forward to everyone watching the film when it comes out. “ I hope everyone falls in love with Rose, who despite her difficulties in managing emotions and changes in her routine, rises to the occasion and shows bravery and kindness to the people around her,” she said.",
