  "text": "LSU product Paul Skenes to start MLB All-Star Game for second year in a row\nNEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - Former LSU star Paul Skenes will make history again this week.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates’ ace was named the National League’s starting pitcher for the Major League Baseball All-Star Game that will air Tuesday night (July 15) at 7 p.m. on Fox 8.\nDetroit Tigers left-hander Tarik Skubal was named starting pitcher for the American League squad. This year’s Midsummer Classic will be played at Atlanta’s Truist Park.\nThe 2025 MLB All-Star Game starting pitchers have been announced.\n— FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX)\nAL: Tarik Skubal\nNL: Paul Skenes[pic.twitter.com/pxtlNBX12w][July 13, 2025]\nSkenes, 23, also started last year’s All-Star Game, despite not making his MLB rookie debut until May 11. He pitched one scoreless inning in that outing, and now becomes the first pitcher in baseball history to start the All-Star Game in his first two MLB seasons.\nAmong position players, only Joe DiMaggio (first seven seasons), Ichiro Suzuki (four), Rod Carew (three) and Frank Robinson (two) were named All-Star Game starters in their first two seasons.\nThe call to National League Starting Pitcher, Paul Skenes\n— Pittsburgh Pirates (@Pirates)[pic.twitter.com/s38F41vV4o][July 12, 2025]\n“One inning of domination,” requested Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who will manage the NL squad.\n“Thank you. It’s a huge honor,” Skenes said.\nSkenes, last year’s NL Rookie of the Year, leads the majors this season with a 2.01 ERA and has racked up 131 strikeouts in 121 innings.\nSkubal (2.23 ERA and 153 strikeouts in 121 innings) becomes the first Detroit pitcher to start an All-Star Game since Max Scherzer in 2013.\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?
