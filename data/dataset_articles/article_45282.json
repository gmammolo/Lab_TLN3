  "text": "Jessica Simpson isn’t letting a little wardrobe mishap get in the way of her comeback!\nThe singer, 44, suffered a wardrobe malfunction on the Wednesday, July 23 edition of Today when she took to the stage with new music after a 15-year hiatus.\nDuring the show, she performed a medley of her past hits, such as “I Think I’m in Love with You” and “With You,” as well as her new release, “Fade.” As she sang, Simpson’s pink bra was exposed when her corset-style top appeared to slip down.\nThe singer kept her cool during the mishap and readjusted her outfit once she realized it had slipped down.\nRelated: Jessica Simpson Says She Was 'Dying' During 'American Idol' Performance While Jessica Simpson came off as cool during her American Idol season 23 finale performance, she was actually a bundle of nerves on the inside. “Oh, my God, I was dying,” Simpson, 44, quipped in an interview with Extra published Monday, May 19. “I can’t even tell you how long it’s been since I’ve been […] Following her performance, Simpson laughed off the incident while speaking to the Today hosts.\n“Of course I had a malfunction here and everywhere, but it’s OK,” she joked. “I think my boobs stayed in, so it’s OK.”\nSimpson also spoke about how it felt “insane” and “really beautiful” to return to stage for the TV performance after so long.\n“Today it was like, ‘Okay, get out of your head. Get out of your head. Who cares if your shoe falls off? Who cares if you forget a lyric?’” she said. “Honestly, it’s just about being able to be up there and be vulnerable and that feels really beautiful.”\nJessica Simpson. (Photo by James Devaney/GC Images) In May, Simpson stepped out for her first TV performance in 15 years, singing at the Season 23 American Idol finale.\nEarlier this year, Simpson released her comeback EP, Nashville Canyon: Pt. 1 , and part two is slated for release on September 4, 2025.\nThe pop star alludes to her marriage troubles with ex-husband Eric Johnson in the lyrics of several songs.\nAmong these songs is “Leave,” which includes the lyrics: “What we had was magic / Now you made it tragic / Giving her what you gave to me / Now the well that you drank from’s empty.”\nRelated: Jessica Simpson and Eric Johnson ‘Want Different Things’: Source For months, there was speculation of trouble in Jessica Simpson’s marriage to husband Eric Johnson. They’ve both been spotted without their wedding rings on multiple occasions and — in an out-of-character move for Simpson — neither noted their 10th wedding anniversary in August 2024 on social media. Simpson, 44, also failed to acknowledge Johnson’s 45th […] Simpson and Johnson separated after 10 years of marriage earlier this year. After dating for several years, the former couple tied the knot at the San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, California in 2014. The pair share three children, Maxwell, 12, Ace, 11, and Birdie, 5.\n“Eric and I have been living separately, navigating a painful situation in our marriage,” Simpson, who began dating Johnson in 2010, told Us Weekly in a statement in January. “Our children come first, and we are focusing on what is best for them. We are grateful for all of the love and support that has been coming our way, and appreciate privacy right now as we work through this as a family.”",
