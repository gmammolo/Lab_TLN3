  "text": "LIXIL Welcomed Tools & Tiaras Campers for Hands-On Plumbing Workshop\nNEW YORK, NY — LIXIL, a global leader in pioneering water and housing products, continued its ongoing partnership with Tools & Tiaras, hosting a hands-on workshop as part of the organization’s 2025 summer camp.\nHeld at the LIXIL Water Experience Center in New York City, the event introduced young girls to the world of plumbing through interactive, educational activities led by industry professionals. Founded by tradeswoman and advocate Judaline Cassidy, Tools & Tiaras empowers girls ages 6 to 14 to explore careers in construction and the skilled trades through real-world experiences, mentorship, and exposure to role models in the field.\nExpanding Access and Representation\nThe skilled labor shortage in the US—particularly in plumbing—has reached critical levels, with demand for qualified workers far outpacing supply. One contributing factor is the industry’s ongoing lack of diversity. While women make up 47% of the overall U.S. workforce, they represent just 2.1% of plumbers. As experienced workers retire and fewer young people enter the trades, LIXIL and Tools & Tiaras see expanding access and representation as key to addressing this workforce gap.\n“At a time when the skilled labor shortage is escalating, we believe in nurturing curiosity and confidence in the next generation—especially among young women who have traditionally been underrepresented in these fields,” said Nik Bafana, SVP & Leader, LIXIL Americas. “By making these careers more visible and accessible, we can help them see what’s possible—and support them in building futures rooted in purpose, creativity, and skill.”\nHands-On Learning\nFeaturing live product displays and innovative solutions from across LIXIL’s portfolio of leading brands—American Standard, GROHE, DXV, INAX, and Basco—the LIXIL Water Experience Center provided an ideal hands-on learning environment for campers. The workshop also marked a meaningful moment in American Standard’s 150th anniversary year, spotlighting the brand’s legacy of plumbing innovation. One activity brought that history to life by exploring the evolution of toilet technology: campers compared an older model to American Standard’s high-efficiency Champion Pro, complete with a golf ball flush test that demonstrated how far performance and water savings have come.\nIn the Water Experience Center’s working shower area, a “Showerhead Showdown” helped campers understand water pressure and flow. The group also constructed DIY water filters using charcoal and other materials, illustrating the science behind the GROHE Blue Chilled & Sparkling 2.0 Water System. Finally, a plate-painting and cleaning activity allowed campers to playfully try out various working kitchen faucets.\n“Our camps prove that confidence and capability grow through hands-on experience,” said Cassidy. “We’re proud to partner with companies like LIXIL that don’t just support our mission—they open their doors, share their resources, and help reimagine what a future in the trades can look like for girls.”\nAdvancing the Trade\nLIXIL’s collaboration with Tools & Tiaras is part of a broader commitment to advancing the plumbing trade. Through initiatives, such as American Standard’s TradeUp program and GROHE’s GIVE program, LIXIL partners with educators, customers, and local communities to provide students with the training, tools, and inspiration needed to become tomorrow’s skilled professionals.\nTo learn more about LIXIL, visit www.lixil.com.\nTo learn more about Tools & Tiaras, visit www.toolsandtiaras.org.",
