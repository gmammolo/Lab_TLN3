  "text": "In the 6th match of the World Championship of Legends (WCL) 2025, AB de Villiers turned back the clock with a breathtaking display of power-hitting against India Champions. Showcasing the flair and timing that defined his prime, the South African legend lit up the stage with a vintage knock that left fans thrilled and bowlers searching for answers.\nAB de Villiers rolls back time with a blistering knock\nComing out to bat on number 4 in the first innings, de Villiers, at 41 years old, rewound the clock with an innings that was a masterclass in modern T20 batting. Leading South Africa Champions against India Champions, he blazed an unbeaten 63 runs off just 30 balls, including 3 fours and 4 towering sixes, at a staggering strike rate of 210.\nWhat truly set his performance apart was the sheer variety and audacity of his stroke play, a hallmark of his prime. Even at this age, de Villiers unleashed his signature shots with remarkable precision and power. Spectators were treated to classic sweeps that defied field placements, audacious inside-out drives over extra cover, perfectly timed lofted pulls that sailed over the ropes, and effortless straight drives down the ground. His ability to manipulate the field and find gaps with such a diverse range of strokes left the Indian bowlers without answers, solidifying his status as ‘Mr. 360’ and proving that age is merely a number when talent and innovation align.\nHere’s the video:\n𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗽 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹, 𝗔𝗕 𝗱𝗲 𝗩𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 🤯\nThe 🐐 just showed that he's still got it, smacking 63* off just 30 balls 🙌\n[#WCL2025][#ABDevilliers][pic.twitter.com/oRvezMqzQ1]— FanCode (@FanCode)\n[July 22, 2025]\nAlso WATCH: South Africa Champions prevail over West Indies Champions in thrilling bowl-out after the match ends in a tie\nIndian batting falters under pressure\nMeanwhile, the defending champions, India Champions, had a dismal outing on Tuesday while chasing a daunting target of 209 runs. The Indian batting lineup crumbled under pressure, losing wickets at regular intervals and failing to build any momentum. Robin Uthappa, Shikhar Dhawan, and Ambati Rayudu fell cheaply, while only Stuart Binny showed some fight with an unbeaten 37 off 39 balls. Yusuf Pathan fell to a stunning relay catch by de Villiers and Sarel Erwee. The middle and lower order offered little resistance as Imran Tahir and Aaron Phangiso ran through the lineup, sealing a dominant 88-run win.\nAlso READ: Pakistan Champions decline points share after India’s withdrawal from the WCL 2025 clash",
