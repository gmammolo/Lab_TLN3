  "text": "Daijiworld Media Network - Mangaluru\nMangaluru, Jul 24: Renowned Kannada poet and playwright Subraya Chokkadi, celebrated for his acclaimed works Munisu Tarave and Sanjeya Raagake, is set to release his very first Tulu song titled ‘Eraye Er?’ on Saturday, July 26 at 7:30 pm through the Zoom digital platform, under the banner of ILESA.\nThe song has been composed by the well-known music director V Manohar, who has brought to life Chokkadi’s lyrical debut in Tulu with exceptional musical arrangement and enriched it further through special choral elements.\nILESA has produced the song as a tribute to Subraya Chokkadi, who has previously penned numerous songs in both Kannada and Tulu and also directed and acted in plays. With this release, a long-standing desire for a Tulu song by Chokkadi will finally be fulfilled.\nChokkadi had expressed his love for Tulu during his felicitation in 2022, where ILESA had requested him to write a song in the language. He has since penned this composition, which beautifully describes nature’s compassion towards humanity and concludes with a thoughtful message urging people to remember and celebrate the wonders of nature in their daily lives.\nThe song has been soulfully rendered by renowned and state award-winning singer Dr Rameshchandra. It has been produced for ILESA by Latheesh Putran, founder of Meghalaya Melodies and an ardent music enthusiast. The video, directed by Nutan Shreyan and filmed by Gopal Patte, features performances by Rameshchandra alongside Patteya Shreya, Shravya, Kavya, Apoorva, and Deeksha.\nThe launch event will be hosted by literary figure Savita Arun Shetty from Mumbai. The song will be released by ILESA patron and leading Abu Dhabi-based organizer Sarvothama Shetty. National award-winning director Santosh Mada and music director V Manohar will join as guests of honour.\nMusic lovers and ILESA supporters can attend the event using Zoom ID: 5340283988 and Passcode: 0324. Mumbai-based coordinator Soori Marnadu has invited all enthusiasts to take part in the celebration.",
