  "text": "Zach Top ’s girlfriend, Amelia Taylor , isn’t afraid to stick up for herself when it comes to dealing with the dating rumor mill. Since going public about her romance with the country artist, she has dealt with online hate and criticism, including death threats. However, instead of letting things fester, Taylor has chosen to face internet trolls head-on to set the record straight about made-up stories that others have said about her. On Monday, July 21, Taylor took to TikTok, sharing a video that found her in a seated position outdoors, feeding a kangaroo. I think I learn something new about myself on here every day. I thought I’d address this in a subtle manner since everyone is so curious. Not that I believe my personal life needs to be made public, but simply because the de@Th threats, su!cide wishes, and assault threats are getting a little out of control. Being with someone in the public eye doesn’t cancel out the fact that I’m human with real human feelings. I’m not 19. I’ve never been anyone’s mistress. I didn’t meet my boyfriend when I was in highschool. I specifically meant the signs that are *self-degrading* to the beautiful girls holding them up and objectifying another human simply because of his talent💕 Disliking another human is fine! Differing opinions make the world go round! However, the de*th threats and su!cide wishes are not okay- Let’s remember that everything we read on the internet isn’t always true! Humans are human- they make mistakes, they’re imperfect. It’s simply the beauty of being human! If you’re constantly sending hate my way, of course I’m going to block you. No human is numb to the hurt that words can cause- Learn to love. It makes life a lot more enjoyable🤍 I just wanna travel and pet kangaroos💋💋 “I think I learn something new about myself on here every day. I thought I’d address this in a subtle manner since everyone is so curious,” she captioned the clip, addressing the curiosity surrounding her and Top’s relationship before implying that rumors about her romantic life have negatively impacted her on an emotional scale. “Not that I believe my personal life needs to be made public, but simply because the de@Th threats, su!cide wishes, and assault threats are getting a little out of control,” she added. “Being with someone in the public eye doesn’t cancel out the fact that I’m human with real human feelings.” In her message, Top’s girlfriend didn’t name anyone specific regarding the gossip that has been spread about her. But, she did clear up any misconceptions about her romance with Top, writing, “I’m not 19. I’ve never been anyone’s mistress. I didn’t meet my boyfriend when I was in high school.” Later on in her post, Taylor further reiterated that neither death threats nor suicide wishes should ever be made toward another individual, but added that she’s perfectly OK with not being everybody’s cup of tea. “Disliking another human is fine! Differing opinions make the world go round!” she wrote. “However, the de*th threats and su!cide wishes are not okay. Let’s remember that everything we read on the internet isn’t always true! Humans are human. They make mistakes, they’re imperfect. It’s simply the beauty of being human!” “If you’re constantly sending hate my way, of course I’m going to block you. No human is numb to the hurt that words can cause. Learn to love. It makes life a lot more enjoyable🤍I just wanna travel and pet kangaroos💋💋,” she concluded her message. According to People , Taylor and Top made their relationship public in Nov. 2024 via TikTok, walking the red carpet at the 58th Annual CMA Awards. Taylor, a native of Mississippi, is a model and a social media influencer. She has also competed in pageants, including 2021 Miss Mississippi Teen USA. If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide or struggling with suicidal thoughts, help is available 24 hours a day through the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988.
