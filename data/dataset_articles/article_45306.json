  "text": "Nothing says summer like a cool, refreshing drink as you enjoy the summer warmth in a comfortable, shaded patio.\nThis time of the year is peak patio season, and it’s the perfect opportunity to take advantage of the beautiful skies and lively scenes before rain and clouds settle back in. Order a filling, delicious meal coupled with a colorful beverage, and enjoy the good vibes. And, you know what’s even better? Patio season is a perfect fit for all, whether you want to go alone and peacefully soak in your surroundings while you enjoy your food, or whether you want to bring your loved ones for a bustling conversation and grab a spoonful out of each other’s dishes.\nThough there’s plenty of great options around town, the North Shore News has tried our best to compile a list of some of the best patio spots around the North Shore for you to check out this summer. If we missed your favourite, let us know! No matter what vibe you’re looking for, we’re certain that you’ll find the perfect fit for you somewhere on the North Shore. Here’s our list below:\nTHE BEACH HOUSE RESTAURANT\nThis West Vancouver spot really has lived many lives. In it’s current configuration, the Beach House offers refreshing seafood with a stunning view of the ocean. In a heritage-designated building that was first built in 1912, this space has been a core aspect to the Dundarave community for decades. In 2010, Beach House moved in to take care of the space and contribute to its already-rich history and legacy.\nThe food and drink menu offers a unique West Coast dining experience, with a rotating seafood-centric menu and a grand selection of martinis and wine. Beach House continues to fulfill this heritage space’s legacy of being a welcoming space where guests are taken care of, and we’re certain you’ll agree once you’re out on the patio, looking out over the water and enjoying their Spicy Japanese Gyoza and Aburi Salmon Oshi Press during happy hour. You could also have a unique brunch here, if you choose to order the Crab Cake Benedict or the Coconut Berry French Toast.\nIf you’re looking for a fruity drink on the side, opt for the Cherry Espresso Martini, or maybe even the Raspberry Cosmopolitan. Maybe you can even go relax at Dundarave Beach, just a few steps away, after your meal.\n150 25th St., West Vancouver\nthebeachhouserestaurant.ca\nTAP & BARREL SHIPYARDS\nA classic and beloved destination for many, Tap & Barrel Shipyards is just steps away from the Lonsdade Quay Market, making it the perfect place to enjoy scenic views off the pier then go shopping on a satisfied, full stomach right after. Better yet, if you decide to visit on a Monday, you’ll enjoy happy hour no matter what time you decide to show.\nThis patio offers unobstructed views of downtown Vancouver, and the perfect spot for those who want a bustling scene with activity all around you. The only catch is you may have a difficult time deciding on a drink, because there’s a fine, quality selection of 36 B.C. craft beers on tap and 16 B.C. wines.\nTap & Barrel also has a well-rounded menu, which includes dishes from countless cuisines. You could go for a flavorful Caper Dill Salmon and grab some cumin-dusted nachos while you enjoy the hustle and bustle. If you’re a brunch fan, you can also enjoy patio season while getting a $4 discount on brunch items on weekends and holidays, as long as you make it before noon. You won’t regret ordering that mimosa in this relaxed environment.\n8 Lonsdale Ave., North Vancouver\ntapandbarrel.com/locations#shipyards\nRAGLAN’S BISTRO\nThis might just be one of the coolest patio spots in the North Shore. The Shipyard’s District has been home to Raglan’s since 1999, and the one promise this restaurant makes is that everyone will have a good time. If you’re looking for a vibrant setting with a beachy atmosphere and fun music, Raglan’s Bistro is a must-visit for you.\nFrom burgers to sauces, everything here is made in house, and the portions are generous. Raglan’s is good for anyone who may want fresh, casual, food in a friendly atmosphere while they can admire the bustling Lower Lonsdale view from a large patio.\nRaglan’s brunch menu has reopened specifically for patio season, and the list is extensive. You could grab a Ragtown Special, a Mexican Brunch Burrito, or even a Caramel Churros Waffle. At Raglan’s you can also opt for a brunch burger, homemade hot dog, or even a taco platter. While you’re out on the vibrant patio, enjoying your sizeable portions, you should also look into ordering one of Raglan Bistro’s beachy, colorful drinks. A special option would be to try one of Raglan’s Electric Teas. Either way, there’s a drink for everyone. After all, what could be better than a classic Pina Colada in your favorite beach-atmosphere patio?\n15 Lonsdale Ave., North Vancouver\nraglans.ca\nBURGOO BISTRO LONSDALE\nAt Burgoo Bistro, comfort is the top priority. At this bistro, you’ll feel right at home, and even more so if you’re out on the patio, sitting out by the sidewalk yet still close enough to the water to have great views of harbour life. This balanced setting is perfect for those who like to engage in people-watching every now-and-then.\nBurgoo Bistro offers a homey, countryside ambiance, and immerses you into a completely old-world vibe as you enjoy your favorite comfort meal. The earthy tones, stone walls, and vibrant greenery around you are bound to help you settle into the space almost immediately, feeling as though you’ve finally come back home after a timeless voyage.\nWhile you enjoy views of both the water and the streets and people around you, make yourself at home with some French Onion Soup and a delicious Lobster Mac & Cheese. For dessert, grab some classic comfort food by ordering warm mini doughnuts, with salted caramel sauce. You’ll be glad to hear that there’s also a great selection of both cocktails and mocktails. There’s the classic Margarita, the Boozy Blueberry Lemonade, and the Italian Boba Soda. Of course, it would be wrong not to mention Burgoo Bistro’s trademark Strawberry Lemonade as well. No matter what you order, you’ll be planning your next visit to Burgoo Bistro Lonsdale before you’ve even left.\n3 Lonsdale Ave., North Vancouver\nburgoo.ca\nKING TAPS AT LONSDALE QUAY\nThe brand new King Taps location in the North Shore just opened this May, and offers an incredible patio which overlooks the waterfront. While you’re there, you can enjoy the lively, friendly vibes and admire the local art and modern designs around you. The ambience will surely keep you energetic and excited to face the rest of your day, even after you’ve left.\nEat some of your favorite North American cuisine, while enjoying some regional wine on the side. For starters, grab some Bang Bang Shrimp and then immerse yourself in their delicious Italian-style cooking by ordering one of their delicious pizzas. Some of the most popular drinks include the Moonwalker and the Pink Flamingo. If you choose to visit King Taps during happy hour, which is two to five p.m. and nine to close daily, you can order a wine for half its price, or one of their many refreshing cocktails for $10. You could even get that Bang Bang Shrimp for $5 off its original price. All of this could be yours while you’re enjoying breezy views of the ocean, which we think is definitely a bonus.\nUnit 141 - 123 Carrie Cates Court, North Vancouver\nkingtaps.com\nARMS REACH BISTRO\nLocated in Deep Cove, this bistro started out as a small, family-run restaurant. Over time, Arms Reach Bistro has become an integral part of the North Vancouver community, and offers tasty meals with a lovely scenic view of the water.\nGoing on a Tuesday evening? You’re just in time for Burger & Beer Tuesday, where you can grab a feature burger of the day with a local craft beer for $22. Couldn’t make it for Tuesday, but are planning on Wednesday? You’re in luck, it’s Pasta and Pint Wednesday, and for $20, you can grab another local craft beer, this time with the feature pasta of the day. If you choose to visit on a Sunday for a nice weekend meal out on the water, Arms Reach Bistro will be having Cellar Sunday, where there’ll be 30 per cent off all bottles of wine from their reserve list.\nEven if you couldn’t make it for any of those special daily features, you’re guaranteed to leave Arms Reach Bistro satisfied any day of the week. Definitely go for their Chosty Caesar Salad, and follow that up with a delicious Spicy Spaghetti, or if you’re feeling handhelds, a B.C. Organic Beef Burger. Don’t forget about dessert; you can’t go wrong with a rich Espresso Chocolate Cheesecake.\n107c-4390 Gallant Ave., North Vancouver.\narmsreachbistro.com\nJOEY SHIPYARDS\nVery worthy of a mention, Joey at the Shipyards has plenty of patio space with a lovely view of the ocean and downtown Vancouver. There’s something for everyone here, and you’ll be immersed into a comfortable, yet elevated dining experience while you’re over at Joey.\nEvery Tuesday, you can grab up to 50 per cent off bottles of wine, and during happy hour, or if you’re looking for a late-night meal, you can opt for the Adult Happy Meal, which offers you three options: Truffle Fries and a Mini Martini, Roasted Corn Guacamole and a Margarita, or a Joey Cheeserburger and your choice of wine or beer.\nThere are tons of solid choices if you choose to dine at Joey Shipyards, whether you order the Spicy Crab Dip, the Truffle Udon Carbonara, or even a delicious Katsu Chicken Salad. If you’re looking for sushi, they’ve also got it: try the delicious Seared Salmon Sushi, and if you’re feeling fancy, order the Steak & Sushi meal. Dessert is a must here, as Joey serves both a salted caramel-chocolatey S’mores Ice Cream Pie and the Crème Brûlée Cheesecake, with passionfruit mango sauce, coconut crumble, and a delicious coconut whipped cream.\nYou can’t go wrong with Joey, and your meal will definitely taste better while you’re also enjoying some views of the ocean.\n125 Victoria Ship Way, North Vancouver\njoeyrestaurants.com\nFISHWORKS\nLooking for some sustainably sourced seafood with fresh ingredients? Look no further, we have the place for you. Fishworks offers a global culinary experience, providing you with both classic and contemporary cuisine, and you can experience this while in a stylish, comfortable patio located in a heritage building.\nTry out this site’s fine wine collection, or even grab a refreshing Lemon Drop or Jamaican Mule during Fishwork’s happy hour. Make sure you don’t miss out on the fresh shellfish offered here, whether it be the Baked Oysters or the Local Manila Clams. If you’re looking for seafood soup, you need to try Fishwork’s Clam Chowder, or surprise yourself with their soup of the day.\nFishworks offers a fresh take on seafood cuisine along with its sustainable, fresh ingredients. The Grilled Marinated Octopus makes for a great appetizer, and there’s a myriad of fish dishes to choose from. The B.C. Wild Sockeye Salmon Wellington comes with a cranberry-almond crust in crispy phyllo, and the Haida Gwaii Sablefish is rich, flavorful, and textured, served with maple hoisin glazed brussel sprouts. If you’re a seafood lover, Fishworks should be your next stop, and the one after that. Don’t forget, you’ll be eating these delicious, flavorful, and creative meals while you’re enjoying the summer warmth in the comfortable shade of their patio.\n91 Lonsdale Ave., North Vancouver\nfishworks.ca\nThis story originally appeared in the Explore the Shore special feature section in the July 23, 2025 print edition of the North Shore News.
