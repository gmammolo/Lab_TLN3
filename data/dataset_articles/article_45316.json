  "text": "WEYI/WSMH: Congresswoman McDonald Rivet opens new Saginaw district office\nJuly 8, 2025\nSAGINAW, Mich. — Congresswoman Kristen McDonald Rivet celebrated the grand opening of her new district office in Saginaw Tuesday.\nThis marks the second office for the congresswoman in the district, following the opening of her first office in Flint on January 3.\n\"It's important that not everybody can drive all the way down to Flint and so this is a way for us to make sure that we are in places where people can reach us,\" McDonald Rivet said. \"If people don't want to come into the office, call us up. Most of our cases are handled over the phone. But it's important that we're in the northern part of the district too.\"\nThe new Saginaw office is located at 4800 Fashion Square Boulevard, across from Fashion Square Mall, inside Suite 200.\nIssues:\nCongress\nCongress Number\nJuly 23, 2025",
