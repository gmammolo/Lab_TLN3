  "text": "JANESVILLE — The day was waning but the July sun still beat hot Wednesday as six young performers took to the grandstand stage at the Rock County Fair.\nThe youth were competing for prize money and local fame in a new event debuting at this year’s fair — the Rock County Idol contest.\nRock County Fair Board President Beth Burdick said organizers had hoped for more participation, but were happy with those who signed up, who were all between 10 and 16 years old.\n“It’s awesome to be able to give these kids the space to show off their talents,” said Burdick, who said the fair hopes to offer the contest again in 2026.\nThe cash prizes were significant.\nContestants went away with $500 as the first place winner, $250 for second place and $100 for third place. They chose their own song and performed it however they liked. Two contestants played the guitar while they sang.\nThe winners were Hunter Wirth, first place; Lucas Dahle, second place; and Bella Bolthouse, third place.\nJudges said they were impressed by the thought contestants put into their song choices and performances.\n“The song selection that people choose is really important. Thinking about who they are, what they really resonate with, and what fits their voice really well in the venue and space, makes a huge difference,” said Matthew Knutson, one of the judges “These performers did a great job. Everyone came up here confidently, sang, and did really well.”\nIn an unexpected moment of generosity, Grizz, the emcee for the night, pulled out his wallet at the end to present contestants who didn’t place in the top three a small cash reward.\n“I believe everybody here deserves something, so I’m gonna give $20 to each competitor, because they absolutely rocked it,” he said. “It takes a lot to get on this stage, a lot of courage, and they showed that tonight”\n“Keep honing your craft and come on back here next year and try and win 2026,” he said, while shaking each of their hands.\nPerformances\nBolthouse performed “Popular” from the Broadway musical “Wicked,” bringing a fun, animated energy to the stage.\nBolthouse is no stranger to the stage. She’s performed in multiple school musicals and even sang the national anthem at two baseball games. Currently, she’s part of the cast of “Mary Poppins,” a summer musical at Starlight Theatre.\n“I’ve been singing since I was probably around six,” she said. “I love singing, so this is what I’m passionate about.”\nDressed in a pink outfit that reflected her bubbly character and love for performance, she also did her makeup to match.\nClaire Seichter, 10, took on a challenging solo performance of “Déjà vu,” by Olivia Rodrigo, a song she delivered with poise beyond her years.\n“I’ve been singing at least for six or seven years,” she shared. “I like singing, and it was just a fun opportunity.”\nYet, stepping into the spotlight still came with a few butterflies.\n“I enjoy performing,” she admitted, “but I’m also very terrified. I get embarrassed really easily.”\nShe said she was proud to be singing solo and thrilled for the chance to stand on stage.\nHarper Tunks, 11, of Edgerton, lit up the evening with her rendition of “Better When I’m Dancing,” by Meghan Trainor.\n“I’ve been singing since I was two, but I’ve been performing for, like, two years,” Tunks said. “I feel like singing is fun, and I like performing in front of people.”\nShe donned a sparkly getup with makeup to match.\n“I love being extra and, like, sparkly,” she said.\nTunks said was pretty nervous, but excited. None of that was noticeable when she performed, confidently strutting down the runway of the grandstand.\nTunks has some experience in the past performing in front of large crowds, including at Janesville Jolly Jingle.\nFair schedule\nThe Rock County Idol contest on Wednesday night is just one of a many events in this full week of fair fun and entertainment.\nThe Rock County Fairgrounds, 1301 Craig Ave., in Janesville, will be open each day of the fair starting at 8 a.m. with all the traditional fun — exhibits, animals, food, music, a carnival and live daily entertainment.\nThe theme of this year’s fair is “Neon Lights & Country Sights.”\nRemaining grandstand entertainment this year includes Blue Steel at 4:30 p.m. on Thursday; Pink Houses at 3 p.m. on Friday; Totally Neon Band at 7 p.m. on Friday; Jay Matthew at 6 p.m. Saturday; and Niko Moon at 8 p.m. Saturday. Rice Bull Riders are the Grandstand entertainment at 4 p.m. Sunday.\nMore information, including the full week’s schedule of events, carnival specials and ticket prices is all at www.rockcounty4hfair.com.",
