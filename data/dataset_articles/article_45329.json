  "text": "Daijiworld Media Network – Batumi\nBatumi, Jul 24: In a historic moment for Indian chess, International Master Divya Deshmukh scripted history by entering the final of the FIDE Women’s Chess World Cup, defeating former world champion Zhongyi Tan of China in the semifinals on Wednesday.\nThe 18-year-old prodigy claimed the mini-match 1.5-0.5 with a gripping victory in the second game, showcasing her tactical brilliance and composure under pressure. With this victory, Divya not only entered the World Cup final but also became the first Indian woman ever to qualify for the prestigious Candidates Tournament, which decides the challenger for the Women’s World Chess Championship title.\nThe Nagpur-based youngster had earlier knocked out second seed Zoner Jhu of China and Indian Grandmaster D Harika, underlining her status as the surprise package — and the giant slayer — of this tournament.\nPlaying with white pieces, Divya opted for the Alapin Sicilian and traded bishops for knights early, transitioning into a pawn-plus endgame. Although Zhongyi Tan had opportunities in the middlegame, the Chinese veteran failed to capitalise, eventually losing track of the position.\nThe battle saw fortunes swing multiple times, with Divya holding two extra pawns in the endgame. Even as Tan resisted till the very end, Divya kept her nerve and clinched victory after an intense 101-move encounter.\nWith the Indian men making strides globally, the spotlight has now turned towards the women — and Divya Deshmukh is leading the charge, following in the footsteps of R Vaishali.\nIn the other semifinal, Koneru Humpy, playing white, drew her classical game against top seed Tingjie Lei of China. Facing the Slav Defense, Humpy aimed for the exchange variation and secured a minor advantage with the bishop pair. Despite reaching a rook and pawn endgame with an extra pawn, the position remained balanced, and the game was drawn after 75 moves.\nHumpy will now play a tie-breaker in the rapid format against Lei to determine the second finalist.\nWith Divya’s sensational run, Indian chess has found its new star, and all eyes will now be on the final where history is waiting to be rewritten once again.",
