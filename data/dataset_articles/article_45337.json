  "text": "Daijiworld Media Network – New Delhi\nNew Delhi, Jul 24: India’s sports market is poised for a strong growth trajectory, with a projected Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 10–12% till 2030, driven by rising fitness awareness and government-led initiatives, according to a new report by CareEdge Ratings.\nThe report pegged the current size of India’s sports market at USD 52 billion, with core sub-sectors contributing USD 31 billion and allied segments adding another USD 21 billion.\n“India’s sports market is on track for sustained expansion,” the report stated, adding that growing public interest in physical fitness, coupled with policy reforms and infrastructure development, is expected to fuel the sector further in the coming years.\nA major contributor to this growth is the sports equipment manufacturing industry, which is experiencing steady scale-up. The sector currently accounts for around 0.9% of India’s GDP, placing it alongside several top-performing sporting nations globally.\nCareEdge highlighted the sector’s strong linkages with industries like media, telecom, education, real estate, and tourism, giving it a powerful multiplier effect in promoting economic, health, and social well-being.\nOn the global front, India’s sports goods exports have shown consistent growth, signalling strong demand and manufacturing competitiveness. In the first 10 months of FY25 (April 2024 – January 2025), sports goods exports reached USD 497.3 million, with projections estimating a jump to USD 660 million in FY26.\nCurrently, 60% of Indian sporting goods are exported, with Jalandhar (Punjab) and Meerut (Uttar Pradesh) serving as the two dominant hubs, together producing 75–80% of the country's total output.\nThe report also pointed out the rise of new manufacturing centres in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Delhi, and Jammu, which are focusing on niche areas like sportswear, synthetic gear, and indoor sports equipment.\nWith ample room for expansion, the report emphasized that continued policy support and infrastructure upgrades will be crucial in enhancing the sports sector’s overall contribution to the Indian economy in the years to come.",
