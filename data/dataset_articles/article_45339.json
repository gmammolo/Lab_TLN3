  "text": "Daijiworld Media Network - Jammu\nJammu, Jul 24: In a remarkable feat of determination and self-belief, Anmol Rathore from Udrana village in Bhaderwah tehsil of Jammu & Kashmir secured All India Rank 7 in the UPSC Civil Services Examination 2023. A law graduate, poet, and state services topper, Anmol’s journey reflects quiet resilience and deep-rooted commitment to public service.\nAs a child in Doda district, Anmol often questioned the lack of infrastructure in her village. Her parents encouraged her to become part of the solution—and those words took root. Guided by this aspiration, she eventually set her sights on the Indian Administrative Service.\nA graduate of National Law University, Gandhinagar (BA LLB Hons., 2021), Anmol began preparing for UPSC immediately after graduation. Her first attempt in 2021 ended at the prelims stage. In 2022, she reached the mains but missed the cutoff by two marks. Undeterred, she came back stronger in 2023 to secure AIR-7 in her third attempt.\nParallelly, she cleared the Jammu and Kashmir Administrative Services (JKAS) 2022 exam, securing Rank 1, and is currently undergoing training.\nAnmol prepared for the exam without attending any coaching institute, relying instead on self-study, online crash courses, and structured practice. Her approach was grounded in mastering NCERTs, standard texts, PYQs (Previous Year Questions), and consistent answer writing.\nFor prelims, she emphasised solving test series. For mains, she focused heavily on improving her writing skills. Her daily schedule included around 8 hours of study, with a balanced focus on General Studies and Law, her optional subject. YouTube and other online platforms served as key tools in her preparation.\nHer interview preparation happened alongside her JKAS training. Questions revolved around her DAF, current affairs, Jammu & Kashmir, and law.\nBeyond academics, Anmol is an accomplished poet. She has published two books of poetry and continued writing even during her UPSC preparation. For her, poetry remains a wellspring of motivation and emotional expression.\nAnmol is the only child of her parents. Her father Rajive Rathore, now retired, was a bank manager, while her mother Jyoti Parihar Rathore is a principal at a government BEd college in Jammu. She began her schooling in Kishtwar and later studied at GD Goenka School, Jammu.\n“Every serious aspirant is already a winner,” Anmol says. She urged candidates to approach the exam process with honesty, focus, and courage. “Fall down seven times, stand up eight,” she reflects on her own setbacks. “Revise, test, repeat — that’s the golden mantra.”\nWith her achievement, Anmol Rathore not only fulfilled her childhood promise but also becomes an inspiration for aspirants across the country—proving that perseverance, passion, and poetry can indeed coexist on the path to public service.",
