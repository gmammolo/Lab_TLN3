  "text": "Sports\nRedbirds recap: Memphis makes fast work of Gwinnett\nThe Memphis Redbirds continued a six-game homestand against the Gwinnett Stripers (Triple-A, Atlanta Braves) with a win Wednesday night at AutoZone Park.\nRedbirds shortstop JJ Wetherholt led off the first inning with a home run for the second consecutive game. In his next at-bat, the left-handed hitter slammed the first pitch of the third inning into the Gwinnett bullpen for his first career Triple-A multi-homer game. The top prospect in the St. Louis Cardinals organization has hit four home runs in eight games with the Redbirds this season.\nThe Redbirds had five solo home runs on their first five hits of the game. Memphis led off each of the first four innings with solo homers. Five home runs are the most by Memphis this season. First baseman Luken Baker, designated hitter Matt Koperniak and third baseman Cesar Prieto each made a home run in the win.\nThis is an excerpt of this story.
