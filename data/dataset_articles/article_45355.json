  "text": "Wednesday, July 23rd 2025, 10:06 pm\nIt was a tough end to the 2024 season for Baltimore tight end Mark Andrews.\nThe former Oklahoma star dropped a game-tying two-point conversion late in the fourth quarter of the divisional round of the AFC playoffs against the Bills. Interestingly enough, Andrews and the Ravens will begin the 2025 campaign at Buffalo. Speaking with the media at training camp, Andrews said, \"It is going to be a great story. I'm excited about that game.\"\nEntering his eighth year with Baltimore, Andrews is also entering the final year of his contract. However, the former third-round pick isn't looking too far ahead. Andrews said, \"It's living in the moment. I'm thankful to be here this year, to be able to compete for this organization and compete for this city. I just want people to know that. It really means everything to me.\"\nHis receiving yards last season were down compared to years past, but Andrews still racked up over 670 yards on 55 catches. Andrews, though, did set a new career high with 11 touchdown catches. Andrews is excited for another run with star quarterback Lamar Jackson, saying, \"I know the type of player I am, the type of man I am. All those things looking forward, I know they're going to help me grow, get better, be the player I'm meant to be, and get to that end goal which I'm incredibly focused on.\"\nAndrews and Baltimore open the 2025 campaign on Sunday, September 7th at Buffalo on Sunday Night Football.",
