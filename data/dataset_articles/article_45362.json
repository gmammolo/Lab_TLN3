  "text": "Brother and sister duo Aaron and Kayla LeCaire have acquired Colville Motor Sports, and changed it to Pro Plus Powersports.\n“We started having conversations about it with (previous owner) Steve Fogle in January,” said Aaron LeCaire. “Steve wanted to retire from the business.”\n“It’s funny, because we’ve known Steve pretty much all our lives,” said Kayla LeCaire. “Our mom used to babysit Steve’s nephews while she was detailing cars. Steve contacted us when he was ready to retire, and it was a really smooth transition. He still pops in here. He’s retired, but he’s still tying up loose ends.”\n“It was hard at first, since our office used to be Steve’s office since we were kids,” Aaron added.\nThe LeCaire siblings are familiar with the power sports business, and have two other locations, previously operated under the name Protection Plus: one in Deer Park, and the other on Spanish Prairie Rd. in Colville.\n“Our mother, Cathy LeCaire, started the business at Spanish Prairie in 1989,” said Aaron. “She began with auto detailing and the business grew. Mom passed away in 2021.”\n“We try to carry on the legacy and name, since none of this would exist without her. So, it was already a family affair when we decided to start the Deer Park location,” added Kayla.\nAaron spent time away from the family business while he served in the Army Special Forces as a Green Beret. He moved back home in 2019. “I was happy to be a part of the business again,” he said. “Kayla’s the boss, though!”\nWhile the power sports business is under a new name, it will continue to sell dirt bikes, ATVs, snowmobiles, and side-by-sides, as well as the accompanying equipment. Pro Plus Powersports also provides parts and service.\n“No matter how old the machine is, we will do our best to help with service and parts, because not everyone has the financial means to just buy a new machine,” said Aaron.\nAaron and Kayla said they grew up riding dirt bikes, snowmobiles, and side-by-sides. “So, we know how people use this stuff and how hard they use and abuse the equipment,” Aaron said.\nAaron and Kayla said they try to have a more familiar approach with their customers. “We are personable, not like auto dealerships,” said Kayla. “Some of the bigger companies are like pressure cookers. We’re here to serve the community. Also, as a woman, I try to make things less intimidating. Some side-by-sides can cost upwards of $50,000, which is a big investment. We like to educate customers about what they’re getting into.”\nKayla is the general manager of all three locations. The LeCaire siblings have retained all of the original staff from when Steve Fogle owned Colville Motor Sports. “We have great people, and I’ve learned a lot from our technician in Deer Park,” said Aaron.\n“We both live in Deer Park and flex our time between the locations,” Kayla said. “We go where we are needed. Aaron and I work very hard. Why would it be fair to ask anyone to work hard when I’m not willing to also? I am very passionate about this.” Kayla said she focuses primarily on operations, while Aaron focuses on service, parts, techs, and mechanics.\n“Kayla has built this business. She had a goal, a vision, and she would not be deterred,” said Aaron.\nAaron and Kayla LeCaire have some changes they’d like to make; for example, they plan on improving the signage, painting the premises, and adding some fencing. They have some layout changes in mind to accommodate larger equipment that they’d like to carry.\n“Eventually, way down the road, we’d like to combine both of the Colville stores in a single location,” said Aaron. “But that is in the future. Mom was smart, because she lived within her means.\n“We think it’s important to invest in our town,” continued Aaron. “We grew up snowmobiling. We help people in need. We give people a chance to ride who would never have the chance. Here at Pro Plus Powersports, we legitimately care.”\nPro Plus Powersports is located at 165 W. Birch Ave. in Colville.",
