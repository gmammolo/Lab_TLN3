Now, thanks to the China-Vietnam Railway Express, which operates daily from Nanning International Railway Port, fresh produce reaches consumers much faster than ever before. Li Wenzi from the Communication University of China explores this massive logistics hub in southern China's Guangxi, which has become the heartbeat of the New Western Land-Sea Corridor. Every day, tens of thousands of cargo-loaded containers converge here, connecting China with ASEAN member countries. The port handles 366 categories of goods via the China-Vietnam Railway Express and 1,160 product types across the entire corridor. By 2025, the corridor's freight rail services will have completed over 300,000 trips, with container volume surpassing 960,000 TEUs. This deeply integrated cross-border supply chain provides southern China with a fast route to the sea, while steadily bringing ASEAN goods into Chinese homes. More than just a trade hub, this port serves as a key component of the Belt and Road Initiative and China's dual circulation development pattern, forging closer ties among China, ASEAN and the world.\n(Li Wenzi, Yuan Ziyan, Zhang Shenmao, Wang Hong, Zhou Xun, Xiao Yinuo contribute to the story.)\nCHOOSE YOUR LANGUAGE\nDOWNLOAD OUR APP\n互联网新闻信息许可证10120180008\nDisinformation report hotline: 010-85061466",
