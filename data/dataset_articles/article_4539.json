  "text": "Missing Zimmerman girl found safe, suspect arrested near Albert Lea\n(ABC 6 News) – Albert Lea Police Department says it helped find a 7-year-old girl from Zimmerman who was reported missing Wednesday night.\nOn Wednesday, January 21st, the Sherburne County Sheriff’s Office launched a search for 7-year-old Brynlee Nelson, who had last been seen at around 3:55 p.m. that day. She disappeared after getting off the school bus, which prompted an AMBER Alert.\nAccording to the sheriff’s office, a black vehicle had been spotted following the bus. It was unknown at that time if the vehicle was related to her disappearance.\nAt around 12:34 a.m. on Thursday, January 22nd, Albert Lea Police got a call of a vehicle going south on Interstate 35 that was potentially associated with the active AMBER Alert.\nDuring a traffic stop near Albert Lea, officers found Nelson in the car and took 28-year-old Joseph Andrew Bragg from Maple Grove into custody.\nNelson was taken to Mayo Clinic in Albert Lea for medical evaluation and has since been reunited with her family. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension canceled the AMBER Alert at around 1:30 a.m., announcing that Nelson had been found safe.\nAccording to the Freeborn County Jail Roster, Bragg was booked just after 1 a.m. for alleged kidnapping.",
