  "text": "25 years ago, writer Liz Calvario's family attended the Backstreet Boys Millennium concert. In a full circle moment, they went to the anniversary show and celebrated the loss of her mother. 25 YEARS AGO, my family created a lifelong connection with the Backstreet Boys. It might sound...unique for not just two fangirls, but also their parents, to be devoted to a boyband. But for our foursome, BSB has been the soundtrack to a shared life of love...and unexpected loss.\nThe connection reached a full-circle moment this year when the group announced on TODAY their \"Into the Millennium\" Sphere residency in Las Vegas.

When we begged to call \"TRL\" countless times, she always indulged us. And when we were in the car yelling every single lyric to every single song? She was right there singing along with us.\nBy 1999, BSB was embarking on their \"Into the Millennium Tour,\" to accompany their sophomore album, \"Millennium.\" Desperate to see them in concert, Leslie and I begged our parents to let us go. By this time, our bedroom was covered in floor-to-ceiling posters; while my dad…\nLiz Calvario",
