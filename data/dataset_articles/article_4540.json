  "text": "ALBERT LEA, Minn — The Albert Lea Police Department said a man is in custody after a child's brief disappearance prompted an AMBER Alert out of Sherburne County Wednesday night.\nAccording to a post on Albert Lea PD's social media, a 28-year-old Maple Grove man was arrested early Thursday following the 7-year-old's safe return.\n\"This incident highlights the importance of public awareness, interagency coordination, and swift law enforcement response during AMBER Alerts,\" the post read.\nOfficials said the 7-year-old girl was reported missing just before 4 p.m. from Zimmerman, where thousands of community members turned out to search.\nThe child was gone for more than eight hours before investigators tracked her to a vehicle traveling south on Interstate 35 in Albert Lea. Police said officers conducted a traffic stop and safely recovered the child before apprehending the man.\nThe 7-year-old was reportedly taken to the hospital for a medical evaluation and later reunited with her family, according to the post.\nThe relationship between the man and child is still unclear.",
