  "text": "“And I am sure of this, that He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.” Philippians 1:6\nI’m excited to share that I was recently honored to join Young Women for America (YWA) at their leadership retreat in San Diego.\nThanks to the thoughtful coordination and hospitality of YWA National Director Faith Ozenbaugh, this retreat was a joy-filled time of encouragement, connection, and shared purpose. I had the opportunity to share insight into the mission and impact of Concerned Women for America in California from advocacy at the State Capitol to the strength of our local chapters.\nI have a deep gratitude for the growing influence of YWA on today’s policy battles, from protecting the integrity of girls’ sports to boldly standing for life through prayers and grassroots action.\nThrough heartfelt conversations, prayer, and powerful discussion, this special gathering reminded us that God is raising up a generation of young women with courageous convictions and compassionate hearts, ready to lead in faith and truth.\nPray:\nPlease pray for the bold, faithful young women who attended the retreat to lead with truth and grace. Pray that they will be strengthened for the work ahead. May their voices be courageous and their hearts always be anchored in the Lord.\nGet Involved:\n- Find out if a CWA of California Prayer/Action exists in your area! Join a group to enjoy the fellowship of like-minded women who desire to make a positive impact in their community, state, and nation.\n- Start a CWA of California Prayer/Action Chapter in your area! CWA of California needs faithful women willing to lead others in prayer and action on a monthly basis. We make it easy. For more information, please do not hesitate to contact me today.\n- Support CWA of California today! Your generous donation assures that the work of CWA of California continues to protect and promote Biblical values and constitutional principles through prayer, education, and advocacy.\nThank you for continuing to stand with us as we equip the next generation to speak up for truth in culture and policy.",
