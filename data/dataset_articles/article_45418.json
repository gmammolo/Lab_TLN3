  "text": "On Friday, July 25th , we invite the entire Saint Mary’s community to celebrate the accomplishments of our Countdown to College (C2C) students during the annual Celebration of C2C Scholarship event in Aquinas Hall at 10:30am . Students will showcase the results of their hard work and learning this Friday in the main level of Aquinas Hall on the Winona campus. The Year 4 students will be presenting research they’ve been working on for B100: Watershed Ecology, with each poster presentation unique to the student and the environments of their home cities. Along with their presentations, our Juniors, Sophomores, and Freshmen will also be presenting some of the projects they’ve been working on, which include: eBook Creator projects in Academic Writing, clocks in Wood Shop, and short films and skits in Theatre! Please come support our students and enjoy refreshments and snacks\nC2C is an academic summer camp at Saint Mary’s for rising 9th-12th graders that prepares first-gen high school students to explore college as an option and prepares them for academic success. This year we welcomed 68 students from partner schools all over the country, including Arizona, Montana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota! Each summer they participate in classes taught by SMUMN and visiting faculty members from other institutions, go on field trips, and personal development activities to help them prepare for college and give them insight on opportunities that could further their education.\nIf you are interested in learning more about the Countdown to College program please reach out to c2c@smumn.edu .",
