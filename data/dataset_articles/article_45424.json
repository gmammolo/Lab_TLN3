  "text": "After two years with the Milwaukee Bucks, Damian Lillard is officially back with the Portland Trail Blazers, where he began his NBA journey. The move came after the Bucks waived Lillard, as he is set to miss a significant part of the 2025-26 season due to injury. Without hesitation, Portland extended a welcoming hand to their franchise icon. Lillard, in turn, embraced the opportunity with a full heart. Now with the Blazers, Lillard joins forces with Jrue Holiday. The reunion comes with a sense of irony and familiarity, as the two had a unique connection even before this season. During a media event on Wednesday, Lillard humorously recalled his time in Milwaukee, living in a house previously owned by Jrue Holiday. Lillard humorously revealed that in Holiday’s house, he faced wifi issues. “ When I lived in Milwaukee, I rented his house for two years so we talked a lot. Like, I was complaining to him about the wifi. There’s a clip online of like I shake his hand, we played them in Boston, we had an interaction and people we’re like what? And we were literally talking about his wifi at his house ,” Lillard said. Lillard now won’t need to rent anyone’s home anymore. He has rejoined the Trail Blazers with a fresh three-year, $42 million contract. The deal has allowed him to settle in with his family and reestablish roots in the city that watched him grow into a superstar. The Trail Blazers celebrated Lillard’s homecoming with a heartfelt social media video showing him entering the team’s locker room. Lillard appeared overwhelmed by the moment, though he tried to hold back the emotion. “ I ain’t gonna cry, but I don’t usually be feeling like this. I feel so happy on the inside ,” Lillard said . Lillard originally played his first 11 seasons with Portland before requesting a trade that eventually sent him to Milwaukee. Across his 13 seasons, split between the Blazers and Bucks, Lillard has averaged 25.1 points, 6.7 assists, and 4.3 rebounds per game. The post originally published on .",
