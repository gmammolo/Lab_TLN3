  "text": "FORT ATKINSON — Friday night will be a gathering of live music, art, and shared summer nostalgia on the banks of the Rock River in Fort Atkinson.\nThe Fort Atkinson Club Community Center, 211 S. Water St. E., in Fort Atkinson, is hosting “Americana on the Rock,” a free outdoor concert from 6 to 9 p.m. Friday, July 25, on its riverside patio.\nOn stage will be the Kettle Moraine Blues Band and musical historian Ed Pierce performing “Songs of Victory,” a tribute to the 80th anniversary of World War II. With sing-along classics like “God Bless America,” and “Over the Rainbow,” the concert will honor American memory through melody.\n“It's a time for just community. Enjoy each other's company, enjoy good music, and, in this case, Americana-themed activities,” said Emely Sanchez Baez, programs manager for the Fort Atkinson Club.\nFort Atkinson Club Executive Director Megwyn Sanders-Andrews said she inherited the event’s name but had to ask herself: What do we mean by Americana?\nThe answer, for her, was visceral: “Sweet tea and fireflies,” she said, adding a list of other things: sitting on the front porch swing, bonfires and starry skies, homemade pies and county fairs, bare feet and slow dancing.\nA live auction featuring Americana-themed items \"and classic summer experiences” will begin at 7 p.m. and will include items such as a bourbon chocolate pie and donated whiskeys.\n“Pie has long been a symbol of home, hospitality and seasonal celebration, small town warmth, neighborly spirit baked into every slice,” shared Sanders-Andrews. “Whiskey reflects America's history of independent distilling, from frontier days to today's craft distilleries. So, it's about heritage, skill and a little rebellious spirit.”\nA 50/50 raffle will be drawn at 8:30 p.m. and concessions including brats, hot dogs, ice cream, beer, and hard lemonade, will be available throughout the night.\nInside the historic club building, guests can explore two art exhibits on view during the event.\n“Made in Wisconsin: Art from America’s Dairyland,” was launched in conjunction with June’s Cheese Louise celebration and showcases “art that had a connection to Wisconsin, to the land, to our agricultural heritage, to pride in our dairy heritage,” said Sanders-Andrews.\nAlso on display will be the “Cattle Call Collection,” an exhibition from Arts for All Wisconsin featuring work by artists with disabilities.\n“These are pieces of such beauty and value that are enriched by the life experiences of the artists who created them,” Sanders-Andrews said.\nThe club has built a growing partnership with the Madison-based organization Arts for All Wisconsin, which Sanders-Andrews says shares its mission of creating inclusive, welcoming spaces “where everyone can be seen for the strengths and talents that they're bringing, and just shown respect and consideration as human beings as part of the full spectrum of human ability that we're all part of.”\nWalking the gallery this week, Sanders-Andrews admired the art and pointed out her embodied reaction to three specific pieces: “Say Cheese,” by Marleah Grinnell, “Portrait of a Curious Cow,” by Mauree Childress, and “Show Your True Colors,” by Aliyah Zeitler.\nThe works illustrating cows made her want to “boop their noses,” Sanders-Andrews said.",
