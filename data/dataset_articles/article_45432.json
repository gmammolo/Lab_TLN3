  "text": "If all goes to plan, Wesley Redman and Jacobi Moore could be part of the Tasmania Devils' inaugural AFL list.\nThat's because the Burnie juniors have put themselves among the country's crop of 16 year olds, which will be eligible for the Devils' first draft in 2027.\nWesley (forward) and Jacobi (midfielder) had the chance to impress recruiters at the national championships on the Gold Coast last week - an experience they didn't take for granted.\n\"It was phenomenal. The facilities were amazing and it was a great opportunity to play against the better players from around the country,\" Jacobi said.\n\"With our coach [Brad Cox-Goodyer] being one of the best forwards in the state, we learned forward craft, positioning and how to sneak a few goals in,\" Wesley said.\n\"We never thought we would go out there and win [by 164 points against Gold Coast Suns Academy], because we prepared for a hard battle.\"\n'The map' also defeated the Northern Territory and Greater Western Sydney Giants to claim the pool B premiership with an undefeated campaign.\nThe Coastal contingent also included Penguin's Jordan Glover and Ulverstone's Ethan Clemons and Lucas Heazlewood, who was named Tasmania's most valuable player.\nWith the Devils set to enter the AFL in 2028, it's given Jacobi and Wesley extra motivation.\n\"I want to go as high as I can go,\" Jacobi said.\n\"We could be the draft class of 2027, so I'm keen to put all my work towards them.\n\"Especially with VFL [expected to come in next year], it's definitely something to look forward to and strive for,\" Wesley said.\nIn the short-term, Jacobi (captain) and Wesley return their focus to Burnie's under 16s team, which sits second on the ladder behind Penguin.\nThe pair, who also play in the colts, were proud to represent the Dockers on the national stage.\n\"The club is always helping us in some way to get better,\" Wesley said.\nWe could be the draft class of 2027, so I'm keen to put all my work towards them.\n- Jacobi Moore\n\"Every opportunity I've had has been through Burnie and they've put their own hands in to get me as far as I can,\" Jacobi said.\nThe NWFL junior season will come to a close on Sunday, July 27, with finals scheduled to get under way the following weekend.",
