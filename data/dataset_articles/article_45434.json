  "text": "New Mexico metal fans remember the Prince of Darkness\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Wednesday night at Revel was all about what Ozzy Osbourne has done for the metal music we hear today.\nThere are so many people who have personal stories about how Osbourne’s music has impacted their lives. A lot of them were at Revel Wednesday night.\nThere was one who took up heavy metal music because of Osbourne, and another couple who met him when he traveled through Hatch and stopped at their burger joint.\nIt’s no wonder so many New Mexicans feel a connection to the godfather of metal. His influence is all around us, including at an iconic burger joint in Hatch — Sparky’s.\nOsbourne visited in 2018 with his kids, Jack and Kelly Osbourne, for an episode of “Ozzy and Jack’s World Detour.”\nOwners Josie and Teako Nunn talked about the experience.\n“I couldn’t believe him walking into our restaurant,” Josie Nunn said. “When he walked in I was like, ‘I can’t believe he’s even here, never in my life I thought I would meet him.’”\nThey whipped him up a special milkshake with green chile, chocolate and vanilla.\n“He just devoured it, and Josie did a double take like, wow I didn’t think it was going to be that good,” Teako Nunn said. “And we made it again the next day and the damn thing was so good that just the next day it went on the menu, and it’s been on the menu ever since.”\nIt’s called “The Ozzy” and it’s popular. From his signature treat, to his signature sound.\n“For me personally, it was hearing those songs like War Pigs, Paranoid, those early (Black) Sabbath songs that really drew my attention to really groovy and also heavy dark metal,” said Channing Concho, the drummer for Suspended, a thrash metal band made up of a trio of Indigenous women.\nThey played their first gig in 2003 at their West Mesa High School talent show, where Concho proudly showed off her Ozzy Osbourne T-shirt.\nThey also helped petition the name change of the school’s performing arts center to honor Randy Castillo. He was in the high school’s marching band and became Osbourne’s drummer in the late 80s and early 90s.\n“Knowing that Randy Castillo was one of us as an Indigenous person, it’s a very big milestone for all of us,” Concho said.\nShe said Osbourne’s music provides connection not only for family and friends but strangers, too.\n“Just those lyrics alone, it just grabs you and sends a message that you’re not alone and that there’s so many people out there that feel exactly the way you do,” Concho said. “And that’s in the music and the music lives on, so Ozzy lives on.”",
