  "text": "Ruth Koson, a resident in Cape Coral, took swift action when a man's life was on the line.\n\"My son said, look how wobbly he is,\" Koson said. \"And about that time, he like, endoed onto his head, onto the pavement.\"\nKoson said she was driving with her son on Mother's Day near Santa Barbara Boulevard and Veterans Memorial Parkway when she noticed a cyclist in distress.\nThe man had suffered cardiac arrest, and Koson immediately jumped into action.\n\"His heart had stopped,\" she said. \"And about that time, a paramedic off duty, Craig, had stopped by, and he also said he didn't have a heartbeat. So we started CPR right away.\"\nThe Cape Coral Fire Department reported that the man's heart had stopped while he was riding his bike. And thanks to the quick response from Koson and that off-duty paramedic, the man was taken to the hospital and is now recovering.\n\"He's doing well,\" Koson said. \"He's getting better every day. I kind of felt like the guy who survived deserves this. I was just there to help, and I would do it for anyone.\"\nThe Cape Coral Fire Department emphasized the importance of bystander CPR.\n\"You do that bystander CPR, you're tripling someone's chance of survival, and that's one of the biggest success stories that we see all the time, and so we always re-emphasize those to the public, so they understand how important it is,\" said Jason Orellana, a Community Risk Reduction Specialist with the Cape Coral Fire Department.\nKoson's quick thinking and teamwork with the paramedic highlight the vital role of CPR in emergencies. Her actions have made a difference, and the community is reminded of the life-saving power of CPR.\nThe Cape Coral Fire Department offers free community CPR training classes. The next one will be held on Aug. 16 from 9 am to noon in Spanish, and 1 to 4 pm in English.",
