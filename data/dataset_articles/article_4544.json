  "text": "Greek Court Acquits Humanitarian Workers in Landmark Lifesaving Case, Highlighting‌ Ongoing Concerns Over Migrant Rights Lesbos, Greece – After a grueling seven-year legal battle, a Greek court on the island of Lesbos today​ acquitted ⁣all 24 defendants accused of felonies for providing humanitarian aid to migrants and asylum seekers. The courtroom ‍erupted in festivity as ​the verdict was ⁤delivered, marking a important, though perhaps insufficient, victory for human rights advocates.\nThe case centered⁣ around volunteers⁢ associated ⁢with‌ Emergency⁣ Response‌ Center⁢ International (ERCI), who were initially arrested in August 2018 by Greek authorities. ⁤ Sara Mardini ‍and Séan ​binder, two ‍prominent volunteers, were among ‍those detained for over 100 days while⁣ prosecutors built⁣ a case alleging they‌ were​ facilitating illegal‍ migration and operating ​a criminal smuggling institution. The prosecution further claimed that fundraising activities constituted money laundering and that ⁤some defendants participated in smuggling ⁢activities while not even being present in Greece.\nDespite Greek law ‍explicitly exempting individuals assisting asylum seekers from criminal penalty, the charges carried potential‌ sentences⁤ of up to ‌20 years ​in ‌prison. This​ case⁣ became known as “the largest case of criminalization‍ of solidarity in Europe,” as described by⁢ the ⁣European Parliament [[1]] .\nThis acquittal follows previous dismissals of⁣ similar‌ charges in⁢ Greek courts, including a case dropped in April 2024 [[1]] . However, the⁣ prosecution’s persistence in pursuing​ felony charges underscores⁤ a troubling trend⁢ of targeting humanitarian work.\n“Saving lives is not a crime,” stated Sara Mardini following the verdict. ⁤⁢\nThe lengthy prosecution has ⁤already had a chilling effect on search ‌and rescue operations in the aegean Sea,⁢ with numerous groups⁢ forced to cease their activities. ‍ This ⁤reduction ​in aid has coincided with a ‍rise in migrant deaths, ​including the⁤ tragic recovery of a seven-year-old‌ girl’s ⁢body ​off the coast of Samos on january 8 [[1]] .\nHuman rights organizations are now calling⁢ on the Greek ‍government to prioritize saving lives ⁣and‍ to take concrete steps‌ to protect‌ humanitarian workers. recommendations include a formal ‌apology to the acquitted⁢ defendants, a commitment⁣ to cease prosecuting individuals ⁤engaged in solidarity work, and the withdrawal of a‍ proposed migration bill that‍ would impose restrictive ‍regulations and penalties on non-governmental organizations [[1]] .\nFurthermore, organizations like Human‍ Rights watch‌ are ⁢urging an ​end to ‍the government’s⁣ “abusive crackdown” against ‌human ​rights defenders‌ [[1]] and [[1]] , and also an immediate halt to the practice of illegal pushbacks at its⁣ borders ‌ [[1]] . These pushbacks, were migrants are forcibly returned ⁣to perilous ‌situations, remain a significant concern for international​ observers.",
