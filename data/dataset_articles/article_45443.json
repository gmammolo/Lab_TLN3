  "text": "このページを\n日本語 で読む\nTokyo Station in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo, was designed by architect Tatsuno Kingo and opened in 1914. Since then, it has played a central role in Japan's railway network.\nOne man, Naoki Sasaki, 64, has a deep passion for the station. He proudly calls himself Japan's only \"Tokyo Station researcher.\" While working full-time at a logistics company, he also publishes photo books and organizes events. With interest from foreign tourists on the rise, he says he wants to \"create a place where people can discover the station's appeal.\"\nA Childhood Spark\nSasaki's fascination with trains began in upper elementary school during a family trip to Kyushu. He remembers riding the Blue Train sleeper from Shin-Osaka and enjoying beef stew in the dining car. \"I still remember the taste,\" he says.\nLater, he joined a railway club with friends and began photographing stations and train yards around Tokyo. \"That's where it all started for me,\" he says.\nIn sixth grade, he planned a trip around the Tohoku region via the Joetsu and Uetsu lines. His parents, who also loved to travel, joined him. Even after his father passed away when Sasaki was in junior high, his mother accompanied him on a trip to Kyushu aboard the Sakurajima–Takachiho express. \"She trusted me and supported what I loved,\" he says with gratitude.\nAfter junior high, Sasaki enrolled in the National Institute of Technology, Tokyo College, hoping to become a conductor for Japan National Railways. But the company was struggling at the time, and talk of privatization made the future seem uncertain. Hiring for conductor positions was limited, so after graduation, he joined a camera company — his second passion after trains.\nA New Focus on Tokyo Station\nEven after starting his career, Sasaki continued photographing trains. But a turning point came in the early 2000s, when JR East and others decided to restore Tokyo Station to its original design. This included rebuilding the third floor and the domed roofs that had been lost in wartime air raids. At the same time, the \"octagonal roof,\" a postwar icon for 60 years, was slated for removal.\n\"I wanted to photograph what was about to disappear,\" Sasaki says. His passion for railway photography was reignited. He experimented with different angles and lighting, and in 2020, as the project ramped up, he published a photo book documenting the changes.\nWhen the restoration was completed in October 2024, he was struck by the sight of the new domes. \"I thought, 'Is this really Tokyo Station?' It looked completely different,\" he recalls.\nBut the restoration also sparked new inspiration. \"The more I photographed it, the more I found I wanted to express and share.\" He began to feel a strong sense of responsibility to pass down the station's history.\nSharing the Station's Story\nAccording to JR East, more than one million people use Tokyo Station each day. Foreign visitors have increased in recent years, but most people still pass through the station without really looking at it.\nNow in his sixties, Sasaki continues to hold regular exhibitions and events to raise awareness of the station's history and charm.\n\"Tokyo Station is a part of the Japanese spirit. It brings together elements that speak to our hearts,\" he says. \"We want to create a space where people can learn its history, appreciate its beauty, and ask questions.\"\nOn August 3, he plans to host an event near the station titled \"Why This Tokyo Station Researcher Is So Deeply Obsessed with Tokyo Station.\"\nSasaki says he will keep exploring and sharing the meaning of Tokyo Station. His goal is to help it remain one of Japan's most beloved destinations.\nRELATED:\nAuthor: Shuta Miyazaki, The Sankei Shimbun\nこのページを\n日本語 で読む",
