  "text": "The fire truck Peoria donated to Ukraine just responded to its first call\nPEORIA (25News Now) - After a decommissioned Peoria fire truck was given a second life overseas, locally-based organization US Ambulances for Ukraine received word Wednesday that it went on its first emergency response call.\n“When you start to get feedback, or you get messages, or even pictures or videos. It’s great to know the vehicles are doing what you hope they would do,” said founder Chris Manson.\nTuesday night, volunteer firefighters in Ukraine used the truck to respond to a small fire in a building that had spread to nearby brush.\n“To see that be able to be carried forward to a whole other country and to see that it can have a positive impact on the community, it makes us feel good inside,” said Peoria Fire Chief Shawn Sollberger.\nIn March, the Peoria City Council approved sending the decommissioned fire truck to Ukraine. US Ambulances for Ukraine vehicles are only used for humanitarian purposes.\nManson has traveled to Ukraine to deliver vehicles around nine times. He took the Peoria truck in May.\nHe and his team have had to take shelter before, but this was the first time they witnessed a large attack, as Ukraine’s war with Russia continues.\n“It was really the first time seeing the anti-aircraft fire go up, seeing them actually hit their targets, you know, seeing explosions in the distance or over the city. So, that was a little unsettling,” Manson said.\nTheir efforts will continue, even after witnessing this violence. The organization is currently working to secure around fifteen more vehicles to donate. These cars, ambulances, and fire trucks will come from all over the United States.\nIn the meantime, the Peoria fire truck is there to answer calls.\n“The citizens of Peoria, and the city council, the fire chief, can rest assured that the vehicle is doing what it’s supposed to be doing, living a good second life serving citizens in need,” Manson said.\nYou can watch 25News - any newscast, anywhere - streaming LIVE on 25NewsNow.com, our 25News mobile app, and on our WEEK 25News SmartTV streaming app. Learn more about how you can get connected to 25News streaming live news here.\nCopyright 2025 WEEK.
