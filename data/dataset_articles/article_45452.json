  "text": "Sweden- /\nSpecialty Stores- /\n- OM:BOKUS\nEarnings Tell The Story For Bokusgruppen AB (publ) (STO:BOKUS) As Its Stock Soars 29%\nBokusgruppen AB (publ) (STO:BOKUS) shares have continued their recent momentum with a 29% gain in the last month alone. The last 30 days bring the annual gain to a very sharp 46%.\nEven after such a large jump in price, there still wouldn't be many who think Bokusgruppen's price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 22.3x is worth a mention when the median P/E in Sweden is similar at about 24x. However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/E.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nBokusgruppen certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favour.\n Check out our latest analysis for Bokusgruppen\nfree report on Bokusgruppenwill help you uncover what's on the horizon.\nDoes Growth Match The P/E?\nIn order to justify its P/E ratio, Bokusgruppen would need to produce growth that's similar to the market.\nIf we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 11%. However, this wasn't enough as the latest three year period has seen an unpleasant 31% overall drop in EPS. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 18% per year during the coming three years according to the sole analyst following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 18% each year, which is not materially different.\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Bokusgruppen's P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting to see average future growth and are only willing to pay a moderate amount for the stock.\nThe Final Word\nIts shares have lifted substantially and now Bokusgruppen's P/E is also back up to the market median. Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.\nAs we suspected, our examination of Bokusgruppen's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook is contributing to its current P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement or deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a high or low P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price moving strongly in either direction in the near future under these circumstances.\nDon't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for Bokusgruppen that you should be aware of.\nOf course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Bokusgruppen. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have reasonable P/E ratios and have grown earnings strongly.\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.\nDiscover if Bokusgruppen might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.\nAccess Free Analysis\nHave feedback on this article?
