  "text": "Mid-Plains Community College has received national recognition for a new program that has driven student success.\nThe college took first place and was honored with the 2025 Jenzabar Impact Award for its Ready-to-Work Building Construction: Homes for Heroes program.\n“This award is a testament to how education can uplift entire communities,” said Mike Steele, MPCC vice president of administrative services. “Students aren’t just learning skills — they’re building homes, hope and a better future for people right here in our region. That’s the true power of this program.”\nLaunched last spring at the MPCC Ogallala Community Campus, the Ready-to-Work Building Construction program was created to teach essential construction skills while helping meet the growing demand for skilled trades workers in west central Nebraska. Under the guidance of instructor Casey Craig, students built a multi-use structure as their first project.\nThat initial effort evolved into the Homes for Heroes initiative when the structure was purchased by The Connection, Lincoln County’s homeless shelter.\nThis year, Ogallala High School students worked with Craig at the MPCC Ogallala Community Campus to build a tiny house for the shelter — the first of several planned units for a new tiny home community in North Platte. The community will provide much-needed housing for area veterans and will include the multi-use structure as a gathering place for the residents.\nMPCC is the first community college to receive the Jenzabar Impact Award. The award was presented at the 2025 Jenzabar Annual Meeting in Nashville, Tennessee.",
