  "text": "A Very Carillon Christmas Wins Ohio Valley Emmy Award\nInformation provided\nDayton, Ohio—On July 19, 2025, A Very Carillon Christmas, a 35-minute holiday television special, won an Ohio Valley Emmy® Award. Co-starring Dayton native Gary Sandy—best known as Andy Travis on the classic TV series WKRP in Cincinnati—and Carillon Historical Park President & CEO Brady Kress, the program was produced and directed by Michael Webber, CEO of MainSail Productions. The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences presented the award.\n“When we set out to film A Very Carillon Christmas, we wanted a fun way to share Carillon Park and Dayton inventions,” said Kress. “We never dreamed it would be nominated for an Emmy®, let alone win one. It’s a huge honor.”\nConceived by Kress, A Very Carillon Christmas is a fast-paced holiday adventure that begins with a chance encounter between him and Sandy. The meeting launches a whirlwind mission to save Christmas, all while highlighting Dayton’s rich legacy of innovation.\n“I tried to pack in as many Dayton inventions as possible,” said Kress. “Given that the city once held more patents per capita than any in America, I couldn’t possibly fit everything.”\nIn addition to its leading actors, the special stars Dayton’s landmark innovations and cultural touchstones—among them the airplane, cash register, automobile starter motor, Cheez-It, and the first NFL game. And of course, Dayton’s own Gary Sandy—who has also starred on Broadway, in soap operas, and numerous TV shows—shines as one of the city’s great talents.\n“Gary originally reached out about photographing one of our exhibits,” Kress added. “That led to a friendship and, eventually, A Very Carillon Christmas. We’re deeply grateful to him, to our staff and volunteers, but especially to the MainSail Productions team and Michael Webber, who agreed to produce and direct the program and helped turn my story into a script. It was a wonderful collaboration and will remain a highlight of A Carillon Christmas, the Park’s month-long holiday celebration, for years to come. Perhaps it’ll even become a holiday tradition for families to enjoy year after year.”\nWatch it HERE for free.",
