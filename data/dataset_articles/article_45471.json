  "text": "The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), Lagos State University (LASU) branch, has commended the intervention of the Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG), Fayoade Adegoke, in resolving a dispute between a student of LASU and a landlord.\nThe conflict led to the arrest and detention of a female student at the police zonal headquarters in Onikan, Lagos.\nThe students’ union said that it initially sought help from the Igando Division but the landlord instead submitted a false petition to the AIG Zone 2, resulting in the student’s arrest.\nAdegoke intervened, ordered the student’s release, and facilitated a roundtable discussion with all parties involved.\nHe then handed the matter over to Commissioner of Police, Lagos State Police Command, Moshood Oluhundare Jimoh, for further resolution.\nCommending Adegoke, Chairman of NANS JCC, Abdulraheem Abdul-Quadri, urged the police to thoroughly investigate the landlord to prevent future false petitions.\nNANS Lagos also appreciated Adegoke’s prompt and student-centred intervention, which prevented prolonged injustice and restored public trust in law enforcement.\nIt, therefore, reiterated that Nigerian students would not tolerate intimidation or oppression, calling on the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) to investigate the landlord’s misleading actions and treat malicious petitions as criminal offences.",
