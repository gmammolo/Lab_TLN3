  "text": "Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson Honors Nelson Mandela International Day—Upholding Democracy Over Division\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nWashington, D.C. — In tribute to Nelson Mandela International Day, Congressman Jonathan L. Jackson issued the following statement:\n“On this day, we honor the legacy of Nelson Mandela—a beacon of hope, a warrior for justice, and a global symbol of reconciliation. Mandela's life taught us something profoundly simple yet deeply powerful:\n‘It is not our diversity which divides us; it is not our ethnicity, or religion or culture that divides us. Since we have achieved our freedom, there can only be one division amongst us: between those who cherish democracy and those who do not.’\nMandela understood, from the long walk to freedom in the streets and prisons of South Africa, that our greatest strength lies in the richness of our differences—our cultures, faiths, and histories. He showed the world that justice and equality are only possible when we choose unity over division, empathy over hatred, and democracy over oppression.\nIn today’s world, as we witness old prejudices resurface and new attempts to silence the marginalized, Mandela's message is more urgent than ever. The real test before us is not the color of our skin or the pronunciation of our names. It is our commitment to democracy—to defending free speech, ensuring fair elections, and guaranteeing equal rights for all people, no matter where they come from.\nLet us remember: The lines that must never be crossed are those that threaten freedom, suppress dissent, or erode human rights. As Mandela reminded us, the division that truly matters is between those who cherish democracy, and those who would allow it to wither. On this day, and every day, I urge each of us to stand boldly on the side of democracy—building bridges, lifting each other up, and never allowing our differences to be used as weapons to divide.\nLet us live what Mandela preached. Cherish democracy. Celebrate one another. And never forget that our shared humanity is our greatest promise.”\n###",
