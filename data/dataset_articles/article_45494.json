  "text": "“If this isn’t nice, what is?”, a new exhibition at the Madoo Conservancy in Sagaponack, is now on view through Aug. 2. Titled after a Kurt Vonnegut collection of his own commencement speeches, the show has been organized by Alejandro Saralegui, Madoo’s director.\nThe exhibition examines Sagaponack as a uniquely American town in which artists, writers, and farmers live side by side. On view are artworks by Robert Dash, Madoo’s founder; Jill Krementz, Marilee Foster, Pingree Louchheim, Loren Dunlap, and Steve Miller. Ms. Foster, an artist and farmer, is represented by a painting of two cucumbers speaking to each other on a farm field.\nBooks from Dash’s library in the show include volumes dedicated to him by Vonnegut and Peter Matthiessen.",
