  "text": "Hari Hara Veera Mallu Review, Rating and Release LIVE Updates: Telugu star Pawan Kalyan’s long-delayed period action-adventure Hari Hara Veera Mallu: Part 1 has finally hit the screens, and a festive spirit has gripped the Telugu states with fans of the “Power Star” celebrating the return of their beloved action hero to the silver screen with full fervour. One of the most anticipated Telugu films of the year, it is expected that Hari Hara Veera Mallu will rescue the Tollywood box office from the rough patch it has been going through since the beginning of 2025.\nHowever, considering that the movie faced multiple postponements, with the premiere date being changed at least three times just this year and filming reportedly continuing until late 2024 — suggesting that the makers had limited time to complete post-production work, including VFX, it remains to be seen if the film can keep the promise it made to Pawan Kalyan’s fans.\nNonetheless, the advance booking for the big-budget actioner, as per Sacnilk, has been strong so far. As of 9 pm on Wednesday, the movie’s first day pre-sales gross had crossed Rs 30 crore worldwide. While Hari Hara Veera Mallu had grossed Rs 7 crore from the Telugu states alone, the total advance bookings for the first day across India had touched Rs 20 crore. The overseas advance collection currently stands at Rs 10 crore.\nGoing by the current trends, Hari Hara Veera Mallu is showing potential to outperform the last three films of Pawan Kalyan in terms of opening collections. While 2023’s Bro grossed Rs 35.2 crore domestically and recorded an India nett collection of Rs 30.05 crore on release day, 2022’s Bheemla Nayak registered Rs 43.10 crore gross (Rs 37.15 crore nett) and 2021’s Vakeel Saab minted Rs 40.10 crore nett.\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Movie Review, Rating and Release LIVE Updates\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review Early review: 'Overall a good film with bad vfx'\nA fan @Vinny_tweetz posted via X, \"Very good first half Second half first 40 mins avrg Last 40 mins are good !! Keeravani’s score is the heart of the film. Kusthi fight & pre climax fights stand out,Songs are good Vfx is below par !! Overall a good film with bad vfx #HariHaraVeeraMallureview.\"\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review Early review: 'Screenplay has an outdated feel to it in many places'\n\"#HariHaraVeeraMallu Strictly Mediocre 1st Half! Apart from PKs presence, a few blocks came out well mainly the intro block from the title cards to PKs introduction sequence. Keervanis bgm is the lifeline so far. However, the screenplay has an outdated feel to it in many places. The VFX is amateur. Dubbing is off with many characters not having proper lip sync and even PKs dubbing feels grainy, \"shared a X user.\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review Early review: 'Pawan Kalyan lost his skill in acting'\nA user @urstrulyPeter shared via X, \"Done with my show, painful 2nd half. Pawan Kalyan lost his skill in acting & Aura. Bobby deol performance ok ok. Nidhi in pretty on screen. VFX worst to core. Not even a single ticket worthy episode. Climax is a big let down. 1.75/5 #HariHaraVeeraMallu.\"\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review Early review: 'Did not live up to our expectations'\n@HanuNews posted on X, \"#HariHaraVeeraMallu is Disappointing We were excited for this magnum opus after hearing the songs and seeing the release trailer, but it did not live up to our expectations in terms of story or visual effects. Keeravani is one of the few people who did their job from the start. Pawan Kalyan acting strains the patience. Nidhi Agarwal's outstanding performance is wasted. We are not sure why this film released.\"\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review LIVE Updates: Gopichandh Malineni shares his best wishes\nDirector Gopichandh Malineni posted on X, \"Powerstorm loading! Wishing the charismatic @PawanKalyan garu and the #HariHaraVeeraMallu team a phenomenal release. The wait ends, and history begins!\"\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review Early review: 'A major disappointment'\n\"From a technical standpoint, the VFX is poor. Many scenes, especially in the second half, appear unfinished and clumsy. Dubbing is another major issue, with several characters, including Pawan Kalyan, suffering from noticeable lip-sync and voice clarity problems. Keeravani’s music remains the film’s only saving grace. Overall, Pawan Kalyan’s presence, a few sequences in the first half, and Keeravani’s music are the only aspects that work. The rest is a major disappointment!,\" read a review for the Pawan Kalyan's film.\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review Early review: 'Second half completely falls apart'\n@venkyreviews posted on X, \"#HariHaraVeeraMallu is a lackluster period action drama, weighed down by an outdated and incoherent screenplay, further hampered by subpar technical quality! The first half is somewhat tolerable and includes a few well-executed sequences, such as the introductory block and the kusthi fight. While the screenplay still feels dated, Keeravani’s background score manages to elevate certain moments in this half. However, the second half completely falls apart and never recovers. It feels both outdated and directionless, as if the director lost track of the plot entirely and added random scenes.\"\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review LIVE Updates: 'A lot of hearts gone into this'\nActor Varun Tej Konidela shared via X, \"It's Veera's Time Wishing the team of #HariHaraVeeraMallu all the success A lot of hearts gone into this, hoping for a powerful blockbuster! Super excited to watch Kalyan babai again on the Big Screen!! Power storm is coming!\"\nHari Hara Veera Mallu Review LIVE Updates: Chandrababu Naidu shares his best wishes\nChief Minister of Andhra Pradesh N. Chandrababu Naidu took to his X account to post in Telugu, \"Pawan Kalyan garu's fans and audience, heartfelt congratulations on the occasion of the release of #HariHaraVeeraMallu, which they have been eagerly awaiting for a long time. My friend Pawan Kalyan garu... I wish that 'Hari Hara Veera Mallu,' his first performance in a film crafted with a historical storyline, becomes a super hit. While fulfilling crucial responsibilities as the Deputy CM in the government... I hope this movie, performed by managing time, captivates all sections of the audience.\"",
