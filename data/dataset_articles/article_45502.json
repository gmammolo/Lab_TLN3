  "text": "Community rallies to help ‘wobbly’ pup\nAn energetic dog with a mysterious neurological condition is one step closer to getting the help he needs, thanks to an outpouring of support from the community. After launching a fundraiser to cover the cost of advanced diagnostic testing, the Wayne County Dog Shelter recently announced its goal of $4,800 has been met.\nThe dog, a male stray named Henna, exhibits a range of concerning signs including unsteady walking, falls, head bobbing, occasionally running into objects and chasing imaginary butterflies. While his behavior is endearing, shelter staff members believe it may be rooted in an undiagnosed neurological disorder.\n“Henna came to the shelter as a stray from Salt Creek Road with two younger pups,” said Summer Foss, shelter manager. “Of course, the pups had a line of adopters wanting them, and they got new homes immediately. Henna watched them leave while he stayed. He trips over his own feet, and he runs into things, but dang it, he’s cute when he does it. He's a very adorable dog.”\nWith funding now secured, shelter staff will schedule a comprehensive series of diagnostic tests including blood work, X-rays, an MRI and a CT scan to try to pinpoint the underlying cause of his symptoms.\n“We’re so thankful for everyone who donated, shared Henna’s story or sent kind words,” Foss said. “Because of you, we’re finally able to move forward with the appropriate steps towards pinpointing a diagnosis for Henna. He deserves this chance at a better life.”\nShelter staff said any remaining funds from the campaign will be used to help other special-needs animals in their care.\nDan Starcher is the public communications coordinator for Wayne County.",
