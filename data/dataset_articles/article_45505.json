  "text": "A child helped rescue a man in his late teens from the water at the beach at Spring Lake Park, 49 Oxford Drive in Lincolnshire, Wednesday evening. | Photo: Village of Lincolnshire Authorities say a teenager nearly drowned but was saved by a 13-year-old who rescued the older teen from the water at a beach in Lincolnshire Wednesday evening.\nThe Lincolnshire-Riverwoods Fire Protection District and Lincolnshire Police Department responded around 5:49 p.m. Wednesday to Spring Lake Park, 49 Oxford Drive in Lincolnshire, for a medical emergency.\nLincolnshire-Riverwoods Fire Protection District Battalion Chief Tyler Reynolds said firefighters and paramedics arrived to find a person who had been removed from the water by a bystander.\nThe victim was transported to a local hospital in unknown condition for further treatment, Reynolds said.\nLincolnshire Deputy Police Chief Kimberly Covelli said officers arrived and found a 19-year-old Lincolnshire man, who was lying on a grassy area near the beach area of the park.\nThe man reported that he was swimming in the lake when he experienced a severe leg cramp.\nThe man experienced difficulty staying afloat and began yelling for help.\nHe was periodically submerging into the water as he tried to stay afloat, Covelli said.\nA 13-year-old boy happened to be walking by the area with his friends when he heard the cries for help and quickly acted.\nCovelli said the 13-year-old jumped into the water and successfully rescued the 19-year-old man by bringing him to shore.\nThe 19-year-old was transported by ambulance to Advocate Condell Medical Center in Libertyville.\nThe police department lauded the younger child and said they are extremely grateful for his heroic actions.",
