  "text": "Five months ago, tension and resentment filled the meeting room inside the Ouray Community Center.\nFrustrated Ouray police officers lashed out at city leaders during a work session for a perceived lack of urgency in fixing a host of departmental problems ranging from pay to work space. One officer was openly combative with Mayor Ethan Funk.\nNone of the four officers who registered their complaints and pleaded for help during that work session are with the department any longer. All of them resigned.\nIn that same meeting room Monday night, smiles and gratitude replaced finger-pointing and desperation. Three new police officers — Sgt. Matt Troxell, Officer Angel Dominguez and Officer Bryce Phillips — and interim Police Chief Daric Harvey were sworn in during a roughly 15-minute ceremony symbolizing a fresh start for a department plagued by low morale and an erosion of public trust the last few years.\nAn audience of more than 50 people — made up of officers’ family members and local residents — gave them two standing ovations: one after officers re- cited a code of ethics and another after they were sworn in.\nHarvey, who was hired in March as the interim chief to replace fired Police Chief Jeff Wood, vowed to reform and rebuild the department, saying he would emphasize values of integrity, transparency and accountability. The city terminated Wood in June 2024 in the wake of a series of internal investigations and concerns about his behavior, leadership and job performance. Wood’s home was also the scene of an alleged sexual assault in 2023 that resulted in the arrests of three men, including his stepson.\n“I think it’s important to note the department and the community have been through a lot these last several months,” Harvey said at the beginning of the ceremony, which was attended by new 7th Judicial District Attorney Anna Cooling. “These folks who are joining the police department all have a mindset of service. They all bring character and ethical behavior with them. That’s one of the reasons we’re reciting the ethics of behavior.”\nA portion of the code of ethics recited by the officers reads: “I will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all and will behave in a manner that does not bring discredit to me or to my agency.”\nHarvey, who has worked in law enforcement for roughly 25 years, told the Plaindealer on Tuesday he’s never seen a standing ovation during a swearing- in ceremony.\n“What that told me is the community is thoroughly behind this police department and is very proud about the progress we’ve made the last few months,” he said.\nFor more than a year before Harvey arrived, former Interim Chief Gary Ray was unable to fill the one vacant officer position that was advertised. In Harvey’s first four months on the job, he has hired three officers and administrative assistant Lucy Reeder and plans to bring aboard two more officers to bring the department up to full staffing.\nTroxell, who officially started July 4, joins Harvey as a veteran officer in the department. Most recently a resident of Virginia, Troxell has some familiarity with Ouray, and previously came to vacation here four years in a row, according to Harvey. He has 16 years of law enforcement experience, including 10 years as a special agent with a federal agency.\nDominguez and Phillips graduated from the police academy earlier this year.\nHarvey recruited Dominguez from the academy at Colorado Mesa University Tech in Grand Junction this past spring. Dominguez, who is bilingual and conversational in American Sign Language, started in May.\nHarvey then recruited Phillips from the Pikes Peak Regional Law Enforcement Academy in Colorado Springs. He started on Sunday.\nTwo more officers could join the department in the near future.\nSee POLICE | Page 16 ▶ Max Austin, a Ouray High School graduate and former Ouray volunteer firefighter, is planning on attending the police academy in August and is expected to graduate by the end of the year.\nHarvey said he’s in the process of interviewing three women who have applied for the remaining officer position.\nHarvey, who was the only full-time officer in Ouray from May 5 until Dominguez joined the department later that month, said he appreciated the community’s support and patience during this period of upheaval.\n“I’m just really grateful to the community for their understanding during this transition time,” he said. “To be a department of one and address not only past problems, the management audit, but taking active steps to become part of the community and build relationships, they have been very gracious in allowing me that time.”",
