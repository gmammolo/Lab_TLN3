  "text": "“She’s getting beaten up”: Barron Trump reportedly saved female friend’s life by calling 999 as woman was being attacked in London\n-\nBarron Trump’s quick thinking reportedly saved the life of his female friend in London, Metro reported.\nTrigger Warning: This article contains references to sexual assault. Reader's discretion is advised.\nThe US President’s 19-year-old son dialled 999 last January to report an assault after he witnessed a woman he knew being allegedly hit by her ex-partner over a FaceTime call. According to Metro, during a hearing at Snaresbrook Crown Court, jurors heard an emergency call recording.\nMatvei Rumiantsev, 22, who has been accused of hitting his former girlfriend, was reportedly jealous of her friendship with Trump. After witnessing the alleged assault, Barron dialed 999 within eight minutes and repeatedly told the operator about the woman “getting beat up.” According to Metro, the 19-year-old said:\n“Oh I’m calling from the US, uh I just got a call from a girl, you know, she’s getting beat up. The address is [Redacted]. This was happening about eight minutes ago. I just figured out how to, how to call someone. Uh, uh it’s really an emergency.”\nBarron Trump explained:\n“I got a call from her with a guy beating her up. (Operator asked, ‘Okay how do you know her?’) I don’t think these details matter, she's getting beat up but okay fine, also I met her on social media, I don’t think that matters.”\nThe operator reportedly asked Trump to “stop being rude” and answer their questions. Barron reiterated that he met his female friend on social media, but didn’t know the name of her partner, who allegedly beat her.\nHe told the operator they were at home and added that he had been on the call with the victim eight minutes before dialing 999, but didn’t know “what could have happened by now.” Barron Trump also apologized “for being rude.”\nShortly after the emergency call ended, police arrived at the woman’s residence. For the unversed, the victim’s former boyfriend has been accused of sexually assaulting her, among other crimes.\nBarron Trump’s female friend describes his call as “a sign from God,” claims he helped save her life\nNEW: Barron Trump is being credited with saving a woman's life after she was being attacked by her ex-boyfriend in the UK, according to Metro.\n— Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg)\nThe revelation came from the woman, who told a London court that Barron Trump's quick thinking saved her life.\nAccording to the report,…pic.twitter.com/BSFABt6yxpJanuary 21, 2026The unidentified woman accused Matvei Rumiantsev, her former partner, of assaulting her during a call with the US president’s son. She claimed that Rumiantsev hurled abuses at her, pushing her to the ground and hitting her. The woman insisted that Barron Trump’s call helped save her (via Metro):\n“He helped save my life. That call was like a sign from God at that moment.”\nAfter Barron Trump witnessed the alleged assault over FaceTime, he informed the emergency services, and the police officers responded to the woman’s residence. According to bodycam footage, she confirmed that she was friends with the US president’s son. The officer shared with his colleague:\n“So apparently this informant from America is likely to be Donald Trump’s son. This female is friends with Donald Trump’s son. She was on a FaceTime with him when this assault happened and he’s called us.”\nThe officers reportedly asked the victim to call Barron Trump to confirm. She Facetimed him to ask about the 999 call. Trump stated:\n“I had someone call the police.”\nHe recounted their previous FaceTime call while talking to the police officers and said:\n“I just saw a ceiling and could hear screaming. I could see a guy’s head on the phone, and then the camera turns to her crying and getting hit.”\nTrump explained:\n“I called you guys – that was the best thing I could do. I wasn’t going to call back and threaten things to him because that would just make the situation worse.”\nThe incident took place in January 2025, hours after the victim claimed her ex-boyfriend sexually assaulted her. She also accused him of raping her in November 2024. However, Matvei Rumiantsev has denied all the allegations. The defendant’s lawyer reportedly described the woman’s account as a “complete fabrication.”\nAccording to Metro, the accused has been charged with assault, actual bodily harm, two counts of rape, intentional strangulation, and perverting the course of justice.",
