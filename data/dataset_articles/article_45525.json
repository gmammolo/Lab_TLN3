  "text": "Penn State’s Drew Allar on his 2025 approach: ‘Not taking any of these moments for granted’\nLAS VEGAS — When it comes to individual statistics, you can’t argue with Drew Allar’s numbers.\nPenn State’s fourth-year quarterback has thrown 49 touchdown passes and run for 10 touchdowns. Interceptions? Just 10.\nAllar enters the 2025 season, his final one at Penn State, with a 62.9 percent completion percentage, the best number for a starter. His interception percentage is 1.19, the lowest number ever for a starter.\nIt’s also true that an Allar-led offense has scored just one touchdown in two losses to Ohio State the last two seasons. And PSU is 0-1 vs. Michigan in that time, losing at home.\nSo, for all those numbers, Allar and his teammates have work left to do this year, a year in which PSU is a top contender to win the Big Ten title and a serious national championship candidate.\n“There’s a lot of things that we came close to last year but didn’t get the job done,” Allar said Wednesday during Penn State’s appearance at Big Ten Media Days at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.\nAllar was alluding to Penn State’s 13-3 season, a home loss to Ohio State, a Big Ten title game loss to Oregon, and a college semifinal playoff loss to Notre Dame.\nAllar continued: “Having one more go at that and (I’m) just doing everything that I can to prepare myself those moments and not taking any of these moments for granted.”\nAllar could have left after 2024. He could have gone early in the 2025 NFL Draft.\nAnd Allar will likely be one of the top quarterbacks selected in the 2026 NFL Draft.\nPenn State veteran center Nick Dawkins, asked Wednesday to make a case for Allar as a franchise NFL quarterback, made a strong one.\n“Drew Allar is the best quarterback in the country,” Dawkins said Wednesday.\n“His mentality, the intangibles, the film. NFL scouts are going to see (it) when they see him. They get paid the big bucks to go do that. Not me, I don’t get paid (big) bucks to do any of that stuff.”\n“Obviously, I come from a biased perspective,” Dawkins added. “He’s one of the best teammates that I’ve ever been around.”\nSaid Penn State coach James Franklin: “(Allar) has gotten better every single year, really in every single area.\n“He’s 6-5, he’s now 235 pounds, can make every throw on the field. (He) has shown that he can hurt people with his feet, and has really, really made tremendous strides as a leader, holding himself to a high standard and willing to have tough conversations with his teammates, as well.”\n“He’s made significant leaps every year. We expect him to take another significant leap this year. Most people had him projected as a first round draft choice last year, and he decided to come back to school, unfinished business collectively as a team but also as an individual.\n“I’m a big Drew fan.”\nRemove the ads\n from your TribLIVE reading experience\nbut still support the journalists\nwho create the content with TribLIVE Ad-Free.",
