  "text": "When Joan Gibson-Bevier first sat down at a pottery wheel in 1976, she knew she had found her passion. Forty- nine years later, she runs her own business, The Closet Potter, from her house in Ouray.\nSeven days a week, Gibson-Bevier wakes up, walks into her studio, turns some music on for motivation, and starts making her pottery. She can easily spend three days decorating one of her pieces, but she finds this time-consuming process enjoyable. “It’s a labor of love,” she said.\nWhile most of Bevier’s pieces are functional, she does not sacrifice style for function. Her wide variety of designs include colorful mountains, black and white abstract, aspen trees, little flowers and more. All of her pieces, however, have one thing in common: the mountain scene she always carves at the bottom.\n“It’s kind of like a little surprise when you turn it over,” she said.\nNot every piece turns out perfect, though.\n“I have had some happy accidents, and you know, we all flop a pot now and then,” she laughed, “I’m very good at knocking things off my table after I’ve spent three days on them.”\nGibson-Bevier’s pottery has been in four galleries in Ouray over the years, but gallery shows have become difficult for her because she is almost 75 years old and has to drag the pieces back and forth, she said. That doesn’t stop her from displaying her pottery at shows, however. She likes indoor shows, and also enjoys setting up shows in her front yard.\n“I just love doing shows, because I love meeting people,” she said.\nGibson-Bevier cannot work full time because of her back pain. She has 24 screws in her back from surgeries correcting her scoliosis. She does pottery on a part-time basis, working as long as she can every day before her back starts hurting.\n“Here’s the beautiful part: I’m so into it that when I’m doing it, I don’t feel my pain that much,” she said. “I’m so focused on the pottery that I don’t notice the pain until I stop for lunch.”\nShe was born in Brooklyn, grew up in Miami, lived in Albuquerque for 24 years, lived in North Carolina for three and a half years, and moved to Ouray in a motor home by herself.\n“That was the greatest adventure,” she said of moving to Ouray. “I kept waiting to get back into a relationship to do that, and then one day it dawned on me: ‘You know what? This is stupid; I can do this on my own!’” As soon as she drove down Main Street, she knew Ouray would be her home.\nThe business aspect of The Closet Potter comes as naturally to her as shaping the clay on the wheel. Before her pottery business, Gibson-Bevier had a career in sales. Her marketing experience and love for interacting with her customers translated perfectly when she started The Closet Potter.\nHer pottery business started in a little closet in her house, and her husband, Ray, came up with her business name.\n“He’s my sidekick,” she said.\nThough her business has expanded to a larger room in the house, her pottery supplies still line the shelves in the tiny closet where it all started back in 2013.\nHer pottery plays a large role in her daily life, scattered across her home by the Uncompahgre River. Ray cooks eggs in a dish she made, and eats them out of another. Their cabinets are stocked with colorful mugs, and there’s even a decoration outside their home that hints at the creativity inside.\nIn the front yard, a totem pole made of pottery stands more than four feet tall.\nThe colorful pole helps people find her home, and adds some personality to the yard.\nGibson-Bevier feels immensely fortunate to have turned her passion into a job, and hopes to keep the creativity flowing for as long as she can. After all, “I got a lotta livin’ to do,” she said. “I mean, I want to live till I’m 100! I have a lot to do!”\nFor more information visit theclosetpotter. com.",
