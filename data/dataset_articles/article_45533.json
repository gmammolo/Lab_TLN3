  "text": "The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) and World Table Tennis (WTT) officially launched a new joint hub in Los Angeles, United States, on 15 July 2025, marking a major strategic step to ignite the immense potential of the Pan-American market.\nThe new facility will comprise the ITTF US Office, the WTT US Office, the WTT Global Training Center, and the World Table Tennis Management Group (WTMG) Global Headquarters. It represents a unified commitment to expanding professional pathways, strengthening grassroots engagement, and advancing commercial development in one of the world’s most dynamic sports markets.\nThe announcement follows the recent celebration of the three-year countdown to the LA28 Olympic Games, as well as the success of US Smash 2025, a WTT Grand Smash that set a new benchmark for how table tennis is staged and experienced in the Americas.\nThe ceremony was held in the presence of Petra Sörling, ITTF President and IOC Member; Steve Dainton, ITTF Group Chief Executive Officer; Lei Zhenjian, WTT Board Director and ITTF Foundation Board Director; Li Zhiqiang, Deputy Consul General of the People’s Republic of China; and Niccolo Campriani, Vice President of Sports, LA28 Organising Committee.\n“The US has always represented a powerful opportunity for table tennis. By establishing a base in America, we are creating new opportunities for emerging talent and deepening our investment in grassroots and elite development alike,” said President Sörling.\nThe training centre will serve dual purposes: supporting the preparation of international athletes ahead of LA28, while also creating new opportunities for emerging American talent. In 2025, ITTF Development will deliver over 30 activities across the Americas, continuing a record pace of grassroots efforts that already saw six international youth events in the region this year. Last year’s World Hopes Week & Challenge in Paraguay stands as a testament to the Federation’s commitment to empowering young talents who can follow in the footsteps of US stars Lily Zhang and Kanak Jha, Brazil’s Hugo Calderano and Bruna Takahashi, and Puerto Rico’s Adriana Díaz.\n“The U.S. is the most competitive sports market in the world; and we’re not just showing up, we’re showing up with purpose. US Smash 2025 proved what’s possible when table tennis meets ambition, and now we’re building on that momentum. This new hub is the start of a long game to embed our sport in the American landscape,” said Dainton.\nCampriani also welcomed the move, “ITTF’s and WTT’s decision to set up a US office in Los Angeles is a highly forward-looking strategic move, fully demonstrating their enterprising and pioneering spirit. For us, it’s about delivering an unforgettable Olympic event. And for ITTF, this is a rare opportunity to elevate the sport across the US. As LA28 draws nearer, we look forward to deepening our collaboration with ITTF to ensure table tennis leaves a lasting legacy.”\nThe WTT US Office, ITTF US Office, and the WTMG Global Office will commence operations by the end of 2025, while the WTT Global Training Center is set to open its doors in the second quarter of 2026.",
