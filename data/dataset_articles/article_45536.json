  "text": "Kiowa Casinos holds grand opening ceremony for the Elk Creek Kiowa Casino\nLAWTON, Okla. (KSWO) - Kiowa Casinos held a grand opening ceremony on July 23, for the Elk Creek Kiowa Casino.\nThe new Hobart location was opened with a tribal blessing, opening remarks from tribal leadership and community partners, and the official cutting of the ribbon.\nThe new casino’s general manager, David Perez, was impassioned to discuss the many opportunities that this opening will bring to the community.\n“Now that we have a casino here, we have so many ways that we can create jobs, different pathways, education programs, training programs, for you to come into these doors and be somebody,” Perez said. “I remember 15 years ago, I was given that opportunity. I was a security guard, and I worked my way up, learnt skills, and became the person I am today. So, I want to be an example for that. We have so many people here that have the same story that I do, and I just wanna be able to open that door for many people in the future.\nThe 25,000 square foot location features over 250 slot machines, table games, bar, and the debut of a full-service Boomarang Diner.\nCopyright 2025 KSWO.
