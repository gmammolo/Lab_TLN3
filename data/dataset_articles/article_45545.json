  "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. — One of the most iconic figures in the history of women’s soccer is getting the honor she rightfully deserves.\nPortland Thorns FC announced that legendary forward Christine Sinclair will be the first-ever inductee into the Thorns Hall of Fame. The club will honor Sinclair’s incredible legacy during a special pre-match ceremony on Saturday, October 4, at Providence Park, ahead of the Thorns' match against Bay FC.\nSinclair's name is synonymous with Portland soccer. From captaining the Thorns since their inaugural season in 2013 to leading the team to an unmatched list of accomplishments, her impact on and off the field is immeasurable. Under her leadership, the Thorns won three NWSL Championships (2013, 2017, 2022), two NWSL Shields (2016, 2021), the 2021 NWSL Challenge Cup, the Women’s International Champions Cup, and the 2020 Fall Series.\nAcross 12 seasons in Portland, Sinclair cemented herself as the club’s all-time leading scorer with 79 goals in all NWSL competitions—second-most in league history. She also holds franchise records in appearances (237), starts (215), minutes played (18,579), and penalty kick goals (10), along with 19 assists, ranking third in Thorns history.\nSinclair’s achievements stretch far beyond Portland. Representing Canada, she appeared in six FIFA Women’s World Cups, four Olympic Games—including a historic gold medal run in Tokyo 2021—and captured continental titles in the Concacaf Women’s Championship and the Pan American Games. With 190 international goals, Sinclair holds the world record for most goals scored by any player, male or female.\nHer accolades include 14 Canada Soccer Player of the Year awards, eight FIFA World Player of the Year nominations, and upcoming inductions into both the Canada Soccer Hall of Fame and Canada Sports Hall of Fame in 2025.\nSinclair’s connection to Portland dates back to her college days, when she starred at the University of Portland. There, she won two national championships (2002, 2005), scored a school-record 110 goals, and took home the MAC Hermann Trophy twice as the top collegiate player in the nation.\nBefore her time in the NWSL, Sinclair built a decorated pro career that included WPS championships with FC Gold Pride and the Western New York Flash, and club stints in Vancouver that laid the foundation for her remarkable rise.\nNow, with her playing career complete, Sinclair becomes a permanent part of Thorns history—forever a legend, forever a Thorn.",
