  "text": "This is branded content for National Patient Transport.\nNational Patient Transport (NPT) is actively recruiting Division 1 or Division 2 Registered Nurses, and Ambulance Community Officers to transition to Patient Transport Officers (PTOs) and Ambulance Transport Attendants (ATAs), especially in regional Victoria.\nNPT is facing a critical staff shortage, particularly across regional communities including Wangaratta, Wodonga, Shepparton, Swan Hill, Mildura, Warrnambool, and Hamilton. NPT is looking for people who bring a calm presence, strong communication skills, and a desire to help.\nAs a leading provider of Non-Emergency Patient Transport services, NPT transfers over 250,000 patients annually across Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia. The work is rewarding and essential, from safely transporting elderly patients to assisting vulnerable individuals in aged care and acute hospital settings.\nTake Sharon Lovett, for example. Two years ago, Sharon transitioned from running a freight business to joining NPT as a PTO which was inspired by a meaningful personal experience.\n\"When my father was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, we had to call Paramedics multiple times,\" Sharon said.\n\"The way they treated my father and our whole family was extraordinary. That level of empathy, care and professionalism stuck with me.\"\nSharon trained with NPT and now works across the Wangaratta and Wodonga branches.\n\"It's the most rewarding role I've ever had. It's sometimes confronting, but it always feels like you're making a difference,\" she said.\n\"People are incredibly grateful, no matter how small the task, they genuinely appreciate that someone's there to help them through a vulnerable moment.\"\nNPT Recruitment Officer Simon Williams said people often think of patient transfer as only emergency services.\n\"But Non-Emergency Patient Transport plays a vital part in the health system,\" he said.\n\"By helping patients who don't require the lights and sirens of an emergency ambulance, we reduce pressure on Ambulance Victoria and provide essential care in communities that rely on us.\"\nNPT is a Registered Training Organisation. Through NPT Heart, the RTO offers tailored courses to help begin or further a career in patient transport.\nFor qualified health professionals: Suitable Division 1 and Division 2 nurses and Ambulance Community Officers can complete a no-cost NPT Patient Transport Bridging Course to step confidently into the role.\nFor those new to the field: NPT provides the opportunity to complete a Certificate III in Patient Transport, to step into one of the most rewarding careers in healthcare.\nMr Williams said NPT offers ongoing support, career development pathways, and a team environment built on empathy, skill, and trust.\n\"Whether you're transitioning from another healthcare role or seeking a new career that allows you to give back to your community, NPT wants to hear from you,\" he said.\nTake a look at some of the NPT vacancies in the Warrnambool region:\nVisit nptgroup.com.au to learn more about training and working with NPT Heart RTO.",
