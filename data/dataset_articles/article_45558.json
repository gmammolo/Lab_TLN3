  "text": "Professional baseball player An Jae-seok (23) of Doosan Bears is set to return to the first team after completing his military service.An Jae-seok is a large infield prospect who joined Doosan as the first overall pick in the 2021 rookie draft. He has played a total of 222 games in the KBO League, with a batting average of .226 (113 hits in 499 at-bats), 6 home runs, 36 RBIs, 58 runs scored, and 7 stolen bases, recording an OPS of .603. Although he has yet to reach his full potential, there are still high expectations for him.An Jae-seok, who enlisted in the army as an active-duty soldier last January, was discharged from military service on the 7th.Doosan's acting manager Jo Sung-hwan noted in an interview on the 20th, “An Jae-seok is expected to start playing games in the second team at the end of July. We need to see how he performs in the Futures League and assess his physical condition. I think we will need to see about 10 games.” He added, “If all goes well, I believe he could come up to the first team around mid-August.”An Jae-seok has gained 15 kg during his military service and has built up his physique. Acting manager Jo Sung-hwan said, “According to the Futures League coaching staff, he has developed his body very well,” and added, “I am trying to elevate him by assessing the situation without being too greedy or overexerting him.”Acting manager Jo Sung-hwan, who indicated he would observe An Jae-seok in about 10 games in the Futures League, stated, “It is not important for An Jae-seok to hit .300 or .400 in the Futures League. We will focus on whether he can play healthily, if he feels comfortable with the pitcher's throws, and how his defensive movements are. If he is healthy, he will be able to perform in the first team.” He also noted, “Of course, if his performance in the Futures League backs him up, he will come up with more confidence, which would be much better.”Doosan has seen stability in its infield with young infielders like rookie Park Jun-soon, Lee Yoo-chan, and Oh Myung-jin performing well this year. Acting manager Jo Sung-hwan shared, “Yang Seok-hwan and Kang Seung-ho are on my mind. I am constantly thinking about how to handle the first base position. Honestly, I was worried about the center line, but thanks to Lee Yoo-chan and Oh Myung-jin, we have quickly found stability. Now, I am more concerned about the first base position,” and said, “If An Jae-seok shows great condition and is needed to be promoted quickly in the Futures League, I will consider him for first base. He used to be a very slim shortstop, but now he has a physique that is suitable for first base.”Acting manager Jo Sung-hwan acknowledged, “It is true that An Jae-seok is suited for the shortstop position,” and added, “He has many very good aspects. But we also need to utilize good players in any way we can. We need some traffic control,” while also saying, “It is a happy concern. This is a concern we can have as much as we want,” and smiled.[OSEN]",
