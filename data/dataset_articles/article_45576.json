  "text": "Cameron Skoloda, 13, celebrates after completing the Kendall Mountain 11k race in 1:08:31, shaving almost 8 minutes off her time in last year’s race. Skoloda, who lives in Ouray and attends Ouray School, was the first female to cross the finish line and the second finisher overall.\nPhoto submitted by Nicole Skoloda\nSend us your celebrations!\nThe “Good For You!” page is a new feature we have launched in the Plaindealer, where we publish reader- submitted photos illustrating community, celebrations and more.\nMaybe you snapped photos of volunteers doing trail work, or your kids raising funds for a local nonprofit with a lemonade stand. Maybe someone in your family was recognized with an award or a scholarship. That’s the kind of thing we’re shooting for. We’re looking for photos of people in the community.\nWant to submit a photo for publication? Here are some guidelines for submissions:\n• This page is dedicated to photos of people doing community-related activities here in the region.\n• Photos should be clear and in focus. We are unable to publish photos that are blurry – a good rule of thumb is if it’s blurry on your screen, it will only look worse in print.\n• Photos should be recent. If you took the picture more than a month ago, it’s probably too old to publish.\nIt should also be clear what’s happening in the photo.\n• Please email your photo to erin@ouraynews.com. In your email, include a description of what’s happening in the photo and please identify the people who are pictured. Dates, the name of the event and first and last names are a must. Not sure what information you need to include? Look at the captions on this page for guidance. Please check to make sure names are spelled correctly.\n• Submission of photos grants the Plaindealer the right to publish submitted photos. In submitting a photo for consideration, you are claiming to be the owner of the image. Please do not submit others’ photographs or work done by professional photographers – they retain the copyrights to their images.",
