  "text": "The Milwaukee Brewers snapped their four-game losing steak with a 5-3 win over the Tampa Bay Rays on Tuesday night at American Family Field.\nFreddy Peralta (4-2) picked up his first win since returning from the injury list by going five innings and allowing only two hits and two runs.\nBrewer Andrew McCutchen broke a 2-2 tie in the fifth inning with a single and Kolton Wong followed with a two-run double to help secure the Milwaukee win.\nMatt Bush came on in the ninth inning to pick up his first save as a Brewer and struck out two batters without giving up a hit.\nMilwaukee and Tampa Bay (58-51) will play the second game of the short series Wednesday at 1:10 pm before the Brewers (59-50) head to St. Louis for a crucial series against the division-leading Cardinals.",
