  "text": "SALT LAKE CITY (KUTV) — Pat Jones-Horton has never waited for permission to lead.\nFrom her earliest days, whether selling the most Girl Scout cookies in her troop or becoming the hopscotch champion in third grade, she was carving her own path — one that would eventually take her from business to politics to nonprofit leadership and beyond.\n“I really don’t see myself as a pioneer,” she said, laughing. “I’ve done some things by happenstance.”\nMORE | Pioneer of Progress: Brent Beesley\nBut look closer, and her path is anything but accidental.\n“I have always been fighting for justice,” Jones-Horton said. “I’m 75 now and will fight to my death for justice.”\nA lifelong Utah resident, she co-founded Dan Jones & Associates with her late husband Dan in 1980. The public opinion and marketing research firm started small but quickly became one of the most respected in the state.\n“There were just two of us when we started,” she said. “The clients would always ask him the questions — they wouldn’t look toward me. I was an accessory. But he’d always say, ‘Ask her. She wrote the questionnaire, she managed the fieldwork, she wrote the analysis.’ And I always appreciated that.”\nOver the years, she helped guide business strategy and branding from Logan to St. George, shaping what people across Utah saw — and thought about — every day.\n“I did qualitative research on just about everything you see when you go down the freeway,” she said. “We named Trax in focus groups. I did research on tires, ice cream, perfume, malls ... all kinds of things. I’ve seen and heard it all.”\nHer biggest takeaway from all that work? The differences between how men and women think and lead.\n“Men and women have complementary differences in how we think,” she said. “And women have been undervalued for years, largely because we are not in leadership roles as much as we should be.”\nThat belief pushed her into politics in 2006, despite knowing it might raise eyebrows among her firm’s mostly Republican clients.\n“It was a little risky for our business,” she said. “But I felt strongly that was the direction I wanted to go.”\nHer motivation was simple and deeply personal: education.\n“The issue that really drew me in was public education,” she said. “I knew we needed more money for schools. We needed to invest in our kids. I saw it in my own children.”\nShe won a seat in the Utah House of Representatives, then later moved to the Senate, serving 14 years total — 12 of those in leadership. But her approach to politics was as strategic as her research work.\n“I made a point to go sit with Republicans to get to know them better,” she said. “You really get to understand someone when you sit next to them, ask their opinions. That served me well.”\nIn January 2015, she stepped away from politics, handed off her business, and turned 65 — all in the same month.\n“I thought I was retiring,” she said with a smile. “But then Scott Anderson from Zions Bank called.”\nAnderson asked her to take on a new challenge: leading the Women’s Leadership Institute, a nonprofit focused on closing Utah’s gender gap in leadership.\n“Utah does really well economically,” Jones-Horton recalled him saying. “But we rank near the bottom in how women are perceived in the state. Too few women in politics, too few on boards, too few in senior leadership — and a gender wage gap that’s hurting our ability to attract and keep talent.”\nShe accepted and created the \"Elevate HER Challenge,\" urging companies to commit to specific, measurable goals to elevate women into leadership.\n“It’s a commitment for companies to think intentionally about elevating women,” she said. “That’s been magical. It has changed the business culture in our state.”\nHundreds of businesses have taken the challenge — and the ripple effect continues.\n“We need women at all kinds of tables,” she said. “Yes, the kitchen table. But also in boardrooms, legislatures, and places where decisions are made. It’s nice to have a voice, but you need to have a vote.”\nThrough it all, Jones-Horton has balanced life as a mother of four and grandmother to 17. Her work never slowed, but she’s always made time for her family — and now, for herself.\nJust weeks ago, she officially retired for the second time. But if you think she’s slowing down, think again.\n“I bike, take line dancing classes, I’m a drummer, my husband is a guitar player,” she said. “Luckily, I found someone who is perfectly matched.”\nThat partner is Professor Joe Horton, who brings a shared love of music, learning, and energy into this next chapter.\nAfter decades of opening doors, raising voices and asking the tough questions, Pat Jones-Horton is still moving forward — with purpose, and with joy.\n“I’ve learned a lot,” she said. “But one thing hasn’t changed: we all deserve a seat at the table — and I’m going to keep fighting until we’re all there.”\n_____",
