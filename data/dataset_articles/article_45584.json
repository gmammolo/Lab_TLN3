  "text": "Community Corner\nDanville Community Asked To Vote On Book For Book Bench\nThe community is asked to give its input on which children's book it would like to see painted on a bench near the library.\nDANVILLE, CA — The town of Danville is continuing its summer tradition of book benches, actual functional bunches that resemble an open book. The question is which book.\nThe community is invited to vote online on which beloved children's book will be painted onto the bench. From now until Aug. 6, the community can choose any of the following books:\n- Percy Jackson and the Olympians\n- Where the Wild Things Are\n- The Hobbit\n- The Very Hungry Caterpillar\n- Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone\n- The Odyssey\n- Don’t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus\n- The Little Prince\nIn 2023, the town added 10 temporary book benches all over downtown, depicting everything from children's books to classic novels to cookbooks. The benches were later auctioned off, and the proceeds supported future public art projects in the town.\nFind out what's happening in Danvillefor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
