  "text": "JACKSON, Miss. (VDN) — Mississippi is ranked third in the nation for bringing jobs back to American soil, according to a new report from the Reshoring Initiative.\nMississippi ranked No. 7 in the U.S. for reshored jobs in 2024, with 10,746 jobs returned from overseas. Projections based on the first quarter of 2025 show the state climbing even higher this year—to No. 3 nationwide, with 12,084 jobs returning to American workers.\n“This is another really impressive accomplishment for Mississippi,” said Gov. Tate Reeves in a press release. “We’re reclaiming thousands of jobs from overseas, which means more opportunities for Mississippians. As global markets shift, we’re setting records in economic development and helping strengthen America’s economy—and we’re just getting started.”\nReshoring is the process of bringing manufacturing and production jobs back to the United States. Mississippi is among the states leading the way, thanks to its strategic location, business-friendly policies, and strong workforce.\nMississippi Development Authority Executive Director Bill Cork credits the rise to years of preparation.\n“We’ve been building the foundation since 2020—readying industrial sites, overhauling tax incentives, and targeting global investors,” Cork said. “This report confirms Mississippi is winning in the competition for job-creating investments.”\nIndustries fueling this growth include transportation equipment, electronics, and wood and paper products. Transportation equipment alone saw a 139% year-over-year increase, while wood and paper products rose 172%, and plastics and rubber jumped 126%.\nTo view the full Reshoring Initiative report or learn more about Mississippi’s economic development efforts, visit mississippi.org .",
