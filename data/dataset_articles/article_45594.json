  "text": "VICKSBURG, Miss. by Alyssa Lick ( VDN ) — For Vicksburg native, Erin Lawson, it started with cheesecake-stuffed strawberries during a global pandemic. What began as a simple creative outlet for a bored teenager has transformed into a thriving dessert brand, a forthcoming storefront, and a beacon of inspiration for young entrepreneurs in Vicksburg.\nAt just 21, Lawson is no stranger to hard work. A Warren Central High School graduate, she earned her associate degree by 19 and is now pursuing a business administration degree from Mississippi State University. Lawson describes herself as “mature, driven and wise beyond my years.”\nFrom age 16 to 19, Lawson worked at the local Chick-fil-A, rising through the ranks to become a closing lead before she turned 20.\n“That role taught me leadership, accountability, and how to work in a fast-paced, customer-focused environment,” she said. “Those lessons still guide me today.”\nLawson, like many during 2020, found herself searching for something to occupy the long, isolated evenings after her shifts.\n“I became infatuated with the cheesecake-filled strawberry trend I kept seeing online,” she recalled. “I tried it, and surprisingly, it was a hit right from the start.”\nWhat followed was an unexpected whirlwind. Friends and family started requesting orders, and Lawson’s kitchen became her testing ground.\n“It kind of snowballed from there,” she said. “That was the spark that lit everything.”\nShe named her growing enterprise Punkies, a childhood nickname that carried personal meaning.\n“I wanted my brand to reflect a piece of me,” she said.\nBy mid-2020, she was selling desserts from her family’s home kitchen. Every inch of counter space became part of her production line, and her refrigerator overflowed with strawberries and filling. Eventually, the family moved into a home with a pool house, a game-changer that Lawson transformed into her own mini bakery.\n“It allowed me to separate work from the main house and gave me room to take on more orders,” she said. “That was a big step in helping Punkies feel like a real business.”\nPunkies tent at the City Wide Pep Rally (Photo by Erin Lawson) Lawson’s journey hasn’t been without hurdles. Without a formal business background, she learned everything on the fly, managing orders, navigating burnout, and marketing her brand. At one point, she even left Vicksburg for Nashville, intending to pursue dental hygiene.\n“But while I was there, I realized I wasn’t passionate about it,” she said. “I ended up switching my major to business, came back home, and returned to Punkies with a clearer vision.”\nThat time away offered clarity: baking wasn’t just a hobby, it was her calling.\nFrom the beginning, Lawson’s hometown showed up for her.\n“The support from my community was everything,” she said. “People in Vicksburg were placing orders, sharing my posts, and cheering me on.”\nWord-of-mouth helped her expand rapidly. Holidays like Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day brought in such demand that she once dipped nearly 700 strawberries in 36 hours.\n“That’s when I knew I needed to treat Punkies like a full-on business,” Lawson said.\nShe quickly gained traction, and not just online. Local schools invited her to vendor events, including Alcorn State University, where she became affectionately known as “the cake lady.”\nNow, Punkies is taking its biggest leap yet: opening a storefront. Lawson recently signed a lease for her first retail location, in the former Gumbo Pot building on Halls Ferry Road, just steps from where she once worked at Chick-fil-A.\n“It felt surreal,” she said. “To go from closing shifts there to now opening my own business just steps away… it hit me hard.”\nLawson’s vision for her new storefront is of a dessert lounge: cozy, welcoming, and intentionally different from a traditional bakery. While the Punkies menu will feature the things that have put her on the map, i.e. cheesecake-stuffed strawberries, pudding cups, cookies, and more; Lawson hopes to expand the menu to include light food options and dessert wines.\n“This won’t just be a counter,” she said. “It’ll be a whole experience, a place where students can study, friends can hang out after dinner, or families can enjoy a sweet treat together.”\nEvents like sip-and-paints, “Love Island” watch parties, and sports game nights are also in the works.\n“Punkies will be for everybody,” she said, adding that family-friendly drink options like ICEEs and Shirley Temples will ensure the space remains inclusive.\nMore than sweets, Lawson sees Punkies as a platform for change.\n“I want it to be a space of influence, support, and mentorship, especially for the youth in Vicksburg,” she said.\nShe’s already hosted multiple community events, like the upcoming Summer Fling Fest on July 27, 2025 at Washington Street Park, her third citywide pop-up featuring vendors, food, music, and family-friendly activities.\nBut Lawson’s vision extends even further. She dreams of launching mentorship programs and workshops for young people interested in entrepreneurship.\n“Even though I’m only 21, I know there’s a generation coming up that needs guidance and someone to show them what’s possible.”\nLawson is already setting her sights on the future, with a goal of a Punkies drive-thru and wider expansion into schools, hospitals, and high-traffic locations.\n“I want Punkies to be a household name, not just for desserts, but for opportunity and community impact,” she said.\nLawson has learned hard lessons along the way; the importance of structure, setting boundaries, and knowing when to say no. Being young, she often felt underestimated.\n“People didn’t always see the vision,” she said. “I had to let my work speak for itself.”\nShe credits her early work experience at Chick-fil-A for much of her business discipline.\n“It taught me structure, customer service, and how to handle pressure,” she said. “To be a good leader, you have to be a good follower first.”\nLawson also offered advice for other up and coming entrepreneurs.\n“Discipline is everything,” she said. “Talent alone isn’t enough. Put yourself in the right environments, stay focused, and stay humble.”\nLawson’s drive is rooted in deep gratitude and strong faith.\n“First and foremost, I want to thank God. None of this would be possible without Him,” she said.\nShe also credits her parents, both educators and business owners, for shaping her work ethic.\n“My dad is always there, no matter how busy he is,” she said. “And my mom is my calm in the chaos.”\nTo every friend, supporter, and customer, she offers heartfelt thanks.\n“Whether you wore a Punkies shirt, helped with supplies, or just encouraged me, you’ve made a difference.”\nThrough all the growth, Lawson remains grounded.\n“As things grow, it’s important that I stay connected to who I am and keep God first in everything I do,” she said. “This isn’t just a business,” she said. “It’s my purpose.”",
