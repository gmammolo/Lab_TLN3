  "text": "The Kewaunee football team will try to pick up where they left off last season when they host Kiel Thursday evening.\nThe Storm went 10-3 last season en route to a Packerland Conference crown and an appearance in the second round of the WIAA Playoffs. Returning to the team is starting quarterback Mitchell Thompson who was All-Conference First Team last season and is on the watchlist for the Dave Krieg Award this year.\nThe Raiders went 5-5 last year as they finished in the middle of the pack in the Eastern Wisconsin Conference before bowing out to Catholic Memorial in the first round. One of their five wins did come against the Storm as the Raiders scored the game-winning score in overtime to win 13-7 in the 2021 opener.\nKickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.",
