  "text": "El Paso\nTwo Adorable El Paso Toddlers Are Competing for “Toddler of the Year”\nBy Grizz,\n14 hours agoBig shoutout to my boy David at KFOX for spotting this gem because this might be the cutest competition you’ll read about all week. Two of El Paso’s tiniest stars, Luna and Lucia, are vying for the title of \"Toddler of the Year\", a national competition hosted by none other than Mario Lopez. Not only does this contest come with serious bragging rights, but it also benefits Toys for Tots, making it all the more adorable and worthwhile.\n2",
