  "text": "PADUCAH — Despite the heat, humidity, and occasional rain showers, fairgoers did not let the weather dampen their spirits as they showed up for day two of the McCracken County Fair.\nThe fair, which brings many locals and visitors from around the region, also supports local organizations and nonprofits through sales and participation. Darrell Matheny, president of the McCracken County Fair, said that although the rain has come and gone, fair officials had safety procedures already in place.\n\"If the lightning comes back up, they'll shut the rides down, and we'll get the people back, and then they can have arm stamps so they can get back in once it clears out,\" Matheny said.\nThe fair features food stands, rides, game booths, and special events scheduled daily. Due to the excessive heat, the fair canceled the wiener dog race on Tuesday night, but Matheny said for now, each special event will still run.\n\"We have wrestling going on here tonight. It's delayed for a bit, but it'll be going on here shortly,\" Matheny said. \"Thursday night, we have Chandler Roberts — he'll be under the top, so rain won't affect him. Then Friday night we have the Enduro, which starts at 7. Saturday night is the demo derby. At 8 o'clock in the morning, we have the second annual McCracken County Car Show.\"\nMultiple fights broke out at one of the fairs last year, which resulted in injured sheriff's deputies and juveniles being taken into custody. Due to the incident, Matheny said officials are bringing back old safety policies.\n\"Kids under 17 have to have an adult with them, and we have arm bands that signify that,\" Matheny said. \"We also have a clear bag policy that, you know, can only be so big and see-through.\"\nStudent volunteers with the Kentucky YMCA Y-Corps were at the fair Wednesday night. Rayleigh Houghland said the goal is to help wherever needed.\n\"What we do is we travel around Kentucky doing service projects and basically just serving back to our community,\" Houghland said.\nAlthough group members did not know they would end up at the fair, Houghland said the group is helping by picking up any trash that is being littered.\n\"We say, 'Participate. Don't anticipate,' and so this was actually kind of a surprise for us, but once we got here, we were like, 'Let's get this show on the road. Let's do it. Let's get the work done,'\" Houghland said.\nShe reminds anyone attending the fair throughout the week to pick up their trash and to drink water. She said the heat and humidity are bad, so she wants everyone to stay safe.\nFor more information about the McCracken County Fair, and a full list of the organizations and nonprofits benefiting from the sales, visit the website or Facebook.",
