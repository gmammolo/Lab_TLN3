  "text": "A new housing project is underway in the Goulds neighborhood of South Miami-Dade County. As plans for the project continue, the developers are seeking to rezone the property. The developers have proposed rezoning the site to allow for a 192-unit residential project.\nHighlights\n- The housing project in Miami plans to rezone to a high-density apartment house district.\n- The new plan offers affordable apartments for workforce housing.\n- The project offers a variety of units and comfortable amenities.\nRezoning for 192-unit Summerbreeze Apartments\nNew housing projects remain active across Miami-Dade County, continuing to shape local neighborhoods. The latest information is from the Summerbreeze Apartments project in the Goulds neighborhood. The 4.6-acre site, acquired in 2015 and 2016, is slated for a new residential development.\nThe site was initially zoned for lower-density residential use, but developers have since updated their plans. There has been a change by the developers, 232 Holdings LLC and 12499 Holdings LLC, led by Charles S. Sacher. They have submitted a pre-application for the rezoning of the project.\nAccording to a report by the South Florida Business Journal, the minimum apartment house district plans in Miami-Dade’s Gould neighborhood are to be rezoned. It will now be a high-density apartment house district. The new designation would allow the developers to increase the number of housing units on the property.\nThe plans will now be for a 192-unit four-story project. 40% of the units will be designated as workforce housing for residents earning up to 120% of the area’s median income. According to HUD, the median household income in Miami-Dade is $79,400.\nThe developers are also seeking a density bonus to build more units than typically allowed under the high-density designation. It permits them to build more units than approved by the high-density zoning.\nProject Features\nThe Summerbreeze Apartments will spread across 192,804 square feet in four stories. The four-story development will include 192 units and 279 parking spaces. The apartments include: 16 studio units, 92 one-bedroom units, 80 two-bedroom units, and four three-bedroom units. These will range from 546 square feet to 1,120 square feet each.\nPlanned amenities at Summerbreeze Apartments include a pool, fitness center, and clubroom. The project location is on the north side of the C-102 Canal. It is near U.S. 1 and Southwest 232nd Street. While the site is located outside major employment hubs, residents will have access to the South Dade TransitWay’s EV bus rapid transit system.\nThe developers have filed the pre-applications for the rezoning. Once feedback is received, they will submit the official documents. This is only the beginning and would need approval from the County Commission later.",
