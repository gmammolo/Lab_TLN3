  "text": "Member for Western Victoria Gayle Tierney has announced that Kane Constructions has been appointed to deliver stage two of the Wurdi Baierr Aquatic and Recreation Centre.\nThe Surf Coast community can soon look forward to their favourite aquatic, recreation and fitness activities with the stage two of the new centre to add:\n- A dedicated learn to swim pool\n- Indoor splash park\n- Spa, sauna and steam room, and\n- Additional change rooms.\nThere will also be additional bench seating, storage and landscaping, and additional car parking making this one of the best aquatic and recreation centres in regional Victoria.\nThese additions will enable local families to learn all the skills they need to be safe around the water and have fun all year-round. A range of exciting programs will provide new opportunities for locals and Surf Coast visitors to enhance their physical and mental wellbeing.\nStage two of the facility is fully funded by the Victorian Government through the Regional Sports Infrastructure Program, which is delivering 16 new and upgraded facilities across regional Victoria.\nStage one includes:\n- An indoor 25-metre pool for lap and squad swimming\n- Warm water indoor pool for exercise and hydrotherapy\n- Gymnasium and program rooms, and\n- Allied health suites.\nStage one is being supported by the Victorian and Australian Governments and Surf Coast Shire Council.\nThe new facility will adjoin and share its entry with the existing Wurdi Baierr Indoor Stadium. Wurdi Baierr is Wadawurrung Language for 'big gathering place'.\nThese upgrades will increase sport and recreation participation across the Surf Coast and neighbouring Geelong communities and bring more sporting, leisure and health activities to regional Victoria, while supporting local businesses.\nMember for Western Victoria Gayle Tierney: \"This is such wonderful news for Torquay and the wider Surf Coast and Geelong communities – including Armstrong Creek. We know how much locals love getting in the water, and this next stage means there'll be even more opportunities for people of all ages to stay active, connect with others, and enjoy everything this incredible region has to offer.\n\"Torquay and the Surf Coast are already known as hubs for surfing and water sports, and this new facility will take that reputation to the next level. We're proud to be delivering an accessible, all-weather, state-of-the-art facility that's just 15 minutes from Armstrong Creek. From learn-to-swim programs to the splash park and spa facilities, there really will be something for everyone. I can't wait to see families, friends, and visitors making the most of these fantastic new spaces.\"\n\"This project isn't just about building a pool – it's creating jobs, boosting the local economy, and giving our communities the skills and facilities they need to stay safe and healthy around the water all year round.\"\nSurf Coast Shire Mayor Mike Bodsworth: \"These additional facilities will elevate the centre to a whole new level so our thanks to the Victorian Government for funding stage two.\n\"The splash park is sure to be a hit with young kids, while adults will certainly appreciate the added comfort of the spa, sauna, and steam room. Having a dedicated learn to swim pool is a vital addition and has been a focus for dedicated community advocates across decades.\n\"The centre will have something for everyone, so locals and visitors will be able to swim, bathe and splash around, regardless of what the weather is doing outside.\"\n- Media release from Member for Western Victoria Gayle Tierney\nhere.",
