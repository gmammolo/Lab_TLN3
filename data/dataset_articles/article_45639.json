  "text": "WashU hosted its inaugural Lab Supply Swap on the WashU Medical Campus in April. The successful four-day event recirculated supplies and delivered cost savings to WashU labs, indirectly supporting cutting-edge research to cure diseases, improve patient care and solve other complex challenges. The swap also supported local nonprofit organizations.\nThe Lab Supply Swap was planned through close collaboration among the Office of Sustainability, WashU Medicine Operations & Facilities Management Department, Environmental Health & Safety, and members of the WashU EnviroCorps.\nThe team collected surplus lab supplies from WashU laboratories over a two-day period. With guidance from Environmental Health & Safety staff, Sustainability and EnviroCorps staff catalogued the supplies and equipment. These were made available for any WashU lab to pick up free of charge. The majority of supplies were new consumables still in their original packaging.\nIn total, 44 WashU laboratories contributed items, while 86 WashU laboratories picked up supplies. The total value of items recirculated to WashU laboratories exceeded $125,000. By the conclusion of the four-day event, 1,625 pounds of lab supplies and equipment had been redistributed to WashU labs. The remaining 189 pounds of supplies, valued over $8,000, were donated to local organizations, including Just Used Tech, KidSmart and the St. Louis Zoo.\nThe team surveyed participating labs and received overwhelmingly positive feedback.\n“Our lab was able to donate a large amount of cryovials that were unused, yet we have had challenges distributing them to labs in need,” Jessica Klette, for Medical Oncology Clinical Trials, said. “The swap was an efficient way to match our surplus with labs who could use the items.”\n “The lab supply swap was an excellent resource as I set up my new lab — providing needed supplies and saving our lab money,” Dr. Stephen Persaud, assistant professor of Pathology and Immunology, said.\n“Based on the success of the inaugural lab supply swap, we anticipate hosting similar events on an annual or biannual basis as staff capacity allows,” Phil Valko, assistant vice chancellor for Sustainability, highlights.\nWashU became a host site for the Campus Compact EnviroCorps program, the first nationwide AmeriCorps program dedicated to campus-based, community-led environmental action, in September 2024. WashU EnviroCorps members supporting the Green Labs Program , circularity, and solid waste pollution prevention programs were integral to planning and hosting the Lab Supply Swap.\n“The value of recirculated goods from the inaugural swap exceeds the annual budget of the WashU EnviroCorps program,” Valko said. “The savings directly accrue to WashU labs and departments and represent one of many ways our phenomenal EnviroCorps team has added value to WashU and our community partner organizations.”",
