  "text": "New Chief Prosecutor Anel Fidoski takes oath: I will perform my profession with honesty, conscience and impartiality\nThe newly elected head of the Skopje Prosecutor's Office, Anel Fidoski, was sworn in today before the members of the Council of Public Prosecutors. He was elected to head the largest prosecutor's office in the country a few days ago, with the support of 7 members of the Council.\n\"First of all, I want to thank the members of the Council who supported me. It is an honor for me to hold this position, but at the same time it is a great responsibility, because I will lead a prosecutor's office that is the largest, which has the largest number of cases and prosecutors. In terms of the complexity of the cases, it is the most difficult prosecutor's office. What I can say now is that I will perform my profession with honesty, conscience, impartiality, and all this with the aim of increasing citizens' trust in the judiciary,\" said Prosecutor Fidoski.\nWhen asked what his priorities are and what he will defend during his term, the prosecutor said he will see what is the highest priority.\n\"I haven't sat down yet to know what I'm facing. I'll have to see what's behind it, what needs to be prioritized. We'll see which cases, what weight of cases we'll be facing, financial crime above all, abuses...\", said the prosecutor.\nWhen asked why he did not propose a program when he applied for the position, Fidoski said that it was not mandatory, and otherwise he would have submitted one.\nTelegrafi",
