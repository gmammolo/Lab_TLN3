  "text": "First responders are reminding residents of what to know and do before entering the water after a family's fun day on the Dan River took a frightening turn earlier this week when a child went under, and so did the adult trying to rescue them. Thankfully, both made were rescued.\nFirst responders, it happened on Monday afternoon at Madison River Park on the Dan River when a child got caught in the river’s current. When a parent jumped in to help, they ended up needing to be saved too.\n“This year, this has not happened very often. This was the most critical call we’ve responded to this year,” said Rodney Cates, Director of Rockingham County Emergency Services\nA nearby witness jumped in to help pull the adult out. First responders got there fast, performing CPR and getting the adult breathing again before taking them to Cone Health Moses Cone Hospital. Both the parent and the child were saved from what could have been a fatal incident, but the child’s condition hasn’t been shared yet.\nRockingham County Emergency Services Director Rodney Cates advises that the best way to stay safe is to wear a life jacket, as it could be the difference between life and death.\n\"Everybody that gets on this river, it is paramount that they wear personal flotation devices (PFDs), the inner tubes can puncture. As you can see, there are many elements out here that can puncture an inner tube. So that personal flotation device is what is going to keep that person afloat,\" said Cates.\nThis graph of the river water levels from Rockingham County officials shows that on Monday, the river was almost 4 feet high. Today, it’s more than a foot lower.\nThat’s why Cates mentions people planning to go in the water need to check weather conditions before going out.\n\"The river is not going to get tired; even the person in the best physical condition will get tired and be taken under at some point,\" said Cates.\nCounty officials say you can also find real-time updates from Duke Energy and local emergency first responders. But most importantly, remember to wear a life jacket and check the weather conditions the day you go on the water. Also, know the route you’re taking on the river and its exit points.",
