  "text": "On Tuesday evening, Wapakoneta native Haley Schattschneider returned to her hometown to celebrate the release of her debut album with a party at the Riverside Art Center. The party gave attendees the chance to meet Schattschneider and enjoy live performances, and was a kick-start to the 2025 Summer Moon Festival.\nSchattschneider said it means everything to her to celebrate the album's release in her hometown.\n“I’ve said it time and time again, but this town is really where I found my love for music and also where I felt just unconditional support from everyone around me, so to be back here just feels absolutely perfect,” Schattschneider said.\nSchattschneider now lives in Nashville where she is a live and session vocalist and vocal contractor. She is known for her unique and versatile sound, and she has worked with famous artists across country, jazz, worship songs and more. Schattschneider is also a production manager for many professional recordings.\nSchattschneider’s album, titled “Over the Moon”, features eight jazz renditions of moon-themed songs like “Fly Me to the Moon,” “Dancing in the Moonlight,” and “Moon River.” It will officially release on Friday. Schattschneider produced the album with her sister, Leah Schattschneider, a Nashville-based mixing engineer who specializes in vocal recording and editing. She said that it’s been incredible working with her sister.\nTo read the entire article, subscribe to the Wapakoneta Daily News today!",
