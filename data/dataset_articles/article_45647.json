  "text": "The musical “Kimberly Akimbo” actually began as a comedic stage play by David Lindsay Abaire and premiered in Costa Mesa, California in 2001. It eventually made its way Off-Broadway at the Manhattan Theatre Club in 2003. After a short run it was shelved. It was only when composer Jeanine Tesori (“Shrek the Musical”) suggested that the play have music added to it that resulted in a Broadway run in 2023 that earned eight Tony Award nominations with five Tony Award wins (Best Musical, Best Book, Best Original Score, Best Actress in a Musical (Victoria Clark) and Best Featured Actress in a Musical (Bonnie Milligan).\nKimberly Levaco (Carolee Carmello) has moved with her family to Bergen County, New Jersey under mysterious conditions. Her dad, Buddy (Jim Hogan) works at a gas station and has a big drinking problem. Her mother, Pattie (Laura Woyasz) is very pregnant and has both arms in casts up to the elbows due to carpel tunnel surgery.",
