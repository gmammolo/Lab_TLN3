  "text": "24 July 2025\n4 mins Read\nEvery year, each Aussie state reveals its most beloved destinations across three categories – the Top Tourism Town, Top Small Tourism Town and Top Tiny Tourism Town. NSW announced its winners last month. Now, it’s Victoria’s time to shine. Drum roll, please…\nSay hello to Victoria’s Top Tourism Town of 2025 – Warrnambool! Open to towns with a population of 5,000 or more, this category recognises stand-out destinations that offer something truly special – and it’s not hard to see why Warrnambool took out top honours. Situated along the iconic Great Ocean Road and a three-hour drive from Melbourne, Warrnambool offers the perfect blend of regional charm and coastal bliss.\nWander along the main drag to explore cosy cafes and vintage boutiques. Or head to the coast for beautiful beaches and scenic walking trails. It’s also a great jumping-off point for the Great Victorian Bathing Trail, a 900-kilometre tourist route that takes in some of the state’s best natural geothermal baths. Start in the heart of town at Deep Blue Hot Springs, a mineral-rich sanctuary of open-air rock pools.\nAdd in friendly locals and a laid-back lifestyle, and Warrnambool’s win feels like a no-brainer. The regional city of Ballarat was hot on its heels, though, scoring the category’s silver award. Maybe 2026 will be your year, Ballarat!\nNext up is Victoria’s Top Small Tourism Town – a category reserved for towns with a population between 1,500 and 5,000. And this year, the award goes to Mount Beauty! It’s all in the name here. This charming township, around a 4.5-hour drive from the state’s capital, sits at the base of Victoria’s highest peak, Mt Bogong.\nMount Beauty is home to some of Victoria’s most bucolic landscapes that have long attracted nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts. From horse-riding tours with Bogong Horseback Adventures to bike tracks and hiking trails, visitors are spoilt for choice. Come the cooler months, the surrounding mountains are covered in snow, and with Mount Hotham only an hour away, it’s the perfect place to book for a cosy winter weekend.\nPort Fairy on the Shipwreck Coast, named after the 700+ vessels submerged in its waters, took out silver in the Top Small Tourism Town category this year. And while it may be a world away from the winner, its rich offerings made for fierce competition.\nThe final category shines the spotlight on Victoria’s pocket-sized towns – those with no more than 1,500 residents. Let’s hear it for the Top Tiny Tourism Town of 2025 – Trentham! Don’t let its size fool you. This historic village, under two hours north-west of Melbourne, sure packs a mighty punch. Sitting pretty atop the Great Dividing Range, Trentham has been enchanting visitors since it was established by gold prospectors in the 1850s.\nFocus soon shifted to gems of a different kind – cosy country pubs, boutique stores and stylish accommodation like The Cosmopolitan Hotel – which solidified Trentham as a regional treasure. But there’s more to the suburb than its charming streetscapes. Aptly named Trentham Falls is the highest single-drop waterfall in Central Victoria, plunging more than 32 metres. Who knew one of Australia’s best waterfalls was just a five-minute drive from town?\nHalls Gap claimed silver for the Top Tiny Tourism Town award. Known as the gateway to the Grampians, the village is another natural wonder. And while an abundance of waterfalls can also be found nearby, they couldn’t quite compete with Trentham’s crown jewel this year.\nBronze commendations for each category were awarded to Echuca, Portarlington and Whitfield, respectively, with all winners decided by the Victoria Tourism Industry Council.",
