  "text": "WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. — Pennsylvania College of Technology recently became an undergraduate affiliate of Erie-based Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM), making students in Penn College’s biomedical sciences bachelor’s degree major eligible to apply for LECOM’s Early Acceptance Program.\nThe affiliation grants qualified Penn College biomedical sciences students a provisional early acceptance to LECOM’s School of Pharmacy, School of Dental Medicine, College of Osteopathic Medicine or School of Podiatric Medicine.\n“Students accepted into this early acceptance program will benefit from a streamlined transition into their professional education, enabling them to complete their degree in a reduced time frame,” explained Tanae A. Traister, Penn College’s assistant dean of nursing and health sciences.\n“We’re extremely thankful for our partnership with LECOM,” said Justin M. Ingram, associate professor of biology at Penn College. “This collaboration provides a wide range of postgraduate opportunities for our biomedical science students to pursue.”\nStudents may apply for LECOM’s Early Acceptance Program as early as their senior year of high school and must apply before their third year in the Penn College biomedical sciences bachelor’s degree.\nPenn College’s bachelor’s degree in biomedical sciences prepares students for work in biomedical and laboratory science fields as well as graduate studies in health care professions. The degree entails comprehensive coursework in the biological sciences, social sciences, chemistry and health care perspectives.\nGraduates have the foundation needed for entry into graduate education in such fields as physician assistant studies, pharmacy, optometry, dentistry, physical therapy, epidemiology and medical research. They are also prepared to work in such fields as medical research, immunology, genetics, chemistry, forensic science, toxicology, microbiology, pharmaceuticals and medical manufacturing.\nTo learn more about the affiliation, contact the Penn College School of Nursing & Health Sciences at 570-327-4519 or email nhs@pct.edu. Those who meet the requirements can apply through LECOM’s early acceptance website: lecom.edu/early-acceptance.\nTo learn more about Penn College’s Bachelor of Science in biomedical sciences, visit pct.edu/biomedical or call 570-327-4519.\nFor information about Penn College, a national leader in applied technology education, visit pct.edu, email admissions@pct.edu or call toll-free 800-367-9222.",
