  "text": "Editor’s Note: McKnight’s Long-Term Care News, McKnight’s Senior Living and McKnight’s Home Care are profiling the McKnight’s 2025 Women of Distinction honorees daily through Aug. 18. For additional McKnight’s Women of Distinction content, visit this page.\nWhen staff at the Lilac Health Group reflect on their time with Director of Operations Cyndi Taplin, they fondly think of her passion for leadership and her mentorship. That energy led her to being named a Veteran VIP in the 2025 McKnight’s Women of Distinction awards program.\nTaplin is a John Maxwell certified leadership coach, mentor and speaker. She has mentored numerous executives who are now CEOs or have held other senior-level executive positions. One of the most inspiring things Taplin has done is start a leadership class for her subordinates, her nominator said.\n“Her ability to balance work and life is truly something to be admired,” the colleague said. “Those in the industry that know Cyndi refer to her as ‘Aunt Cyndi’ or ‘Sister,’ because, to her, everyone becomes family, and she welcomes all with open arms.”\nTaplin has implemented Disney Institute training, an approach to quality service, in various organizations. The training’s philosophy is to put the customer at the front of the mind, thus empowering people and unifying the training’s process — outstanding customer service becomes possible on a consistent basis, from the first greeting to the final meeting. The training ultimately aims to provide the customer with a greater incentive to return and recommend services to others.\n“Cyndi is the true definition of a leader; her unwavering commitment to supporting her colleagues and administrators has made a significant impact on my professional growth alone,” one colleague said in nominating her.\n“Cyndi’s willingness to step into the role of interim administrator and her dedication as the regional director of operations demonstrate her remarkable versatility and dedication to the long-term care sector,” the colleague added. “Her passion and personal connection to the industry not only enhances the work environment but also fosters the development of those around her, which I was able to witness each and every day.”\nThe McKnight’s Women of Distinction program is jointly administered by McKnight’s Long-Term Care News, McKnight’s Senior Living and McKnight’s Home Care. Healthcare Services Group was the Platinum sponsor of this year’s festivities, and PharMerica was the Silver sponsor. Additional sponsors included Affinity Health Services, Curana Health, DirecTV for Business, EasyShifts, Guardian Pharmacy Services, Marquis Health Consulting Services, Priority Life Care, Reliant Rehabilitation, Reside Admissions and Sentrics.\nVisit this web page to see lists of honorees from 2025 and previous years.",
