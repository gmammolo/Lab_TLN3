  "text": "Heading into the 2025–2026 NFL season, much of the Washington Commanders’ defensive buzz surrounds All-Pro linebackers Bobby Wagner and Frankie Luvu, who bring a wealth of experience and elite production. But a new name is emerging in the background, second-year linebacker Jordan Magee. After a developmental rookie season, Magee now looks primed to carve out a rotational role. The second-year player offers speed, instincts, and physicality that could elevate Washington’s already formidable linebacker unit.\nMagee may not be a household name yet, but that could change quickly. His blend of athleticism and hunger makes him a natural fit in Dan Quinn’s aggressive defensive system. While Wagner and Luvu bring veteran reliability, Magee’s energy and growth potential could become a key X-factor in the Commanders’ push for an elite front seven.\nLearning from Legends and Gaining Confidence\nWashington drafted Magee in the sixth round of the 2024 NFL Draft. Many viewed him as a special-teams contributor and long-term project. But throughout his rookie year, which started with an injury that derailed his early progress, Magee quietly impressed. Coaches love his work ethic, film study habits, and sideline-to-sideline pursuit.\nWhat’s made his leap in Year 2 so promising is the environment around him. Few young linebackers get to learn from two All-Pro talents like Wagner, a future Hall of Famer, and Luvu, one of the most versatile disruptors in the league. Wagner’s ability to diagnose plays and Luvu’s relentless motor have served as on-field blueprints for Magee, who now blends those lessons with his own natural instincts.\nAfter Day 1 of Commanders Training Camp, Magee spoke with NFL Insider and Analyst Lake Lewis Jr. about learning from Wagner and Luvu.\nYes. It’s a blessing to be in the same room as them. Frankie, an All-Pro, and Bobby, a twelve-time All-Pro and first ballot Hall of Famer,” the Temple standout said. “Just to be in a room with those guys is a blessing, but they’re really different in their own ways. For Frankie, he’s a more up-energy, like, pass rush guy. So, you know, taking small steps with him, bringing it into my game, and taking small steps with Bobby, bringing it into my game. You know, with Bobby, I’ve kind of been under his wing for the past year, learning from him. We just worked out early in the morning. So, you know, just following him, seeing what he does, his routine, and try to mimic that, and try to bring that into my whole thing. That’s what I’m trying to do, just taking little things from those guys, because they’re both great players, and they’re future Hall-of-Famers. So, you know, if I can do that, I have a good chance at being in that category. So, you know, just go out there, and just, you know, do my thing.\nDuring offseason practices and minicamp, Magee looked faster, more decisive, and noticeably more confident. Coaches have highlighted his closing speed and awareness in coverage, two areas where Washington needs depth behind its top two starters. As offenses become more reliant on quick passes and versatile backs, linebackers like Magee, who can both hit and cover, become invaluable.\nMagee’s growth also opens up rotational flexibility. Quinn and defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. love to rotate their front seven and keep players fresh. With Magee showing readiness to take live reps, the Commanders can ease the load on Wagner and Luvu, especially late in games or down the stretch of the season.\nA Depth Piece with Starting Potential\nMagee’s impact may begin on special teams, where he already proved to be a consistent contributor in 2024. But his path to greater responsibility lies in his ability to stay disciplined in run fits and offer versatility in sub-packages.\nIn College, McGee was a tackling machine who showed strong leadership and toughness. That physical identity now has a place on a Commanders’ defense that’s focused on speed and violence. As Washington faces mobile quarterbacks, quick game passing, and modern spread formations, linebackers must be able to think and react without hesitation. Magee brings those traits and adds something else: youthful explosiveness. He runs well, breaks down in space, and brings the type of pop that creates turnovers. In goal-line packages and third-down situations, his burst could disrupt blocking schemes or create mismatches against tight ends and running backs.\nIf injuries or rest periods force the Commanders to go deeper into their linebacker rotation, Magee is not just a stopgap; he’s a player with real upside. With a full offseason in the strength program and a year of mental reps under his belt, he has positioned himself to be more than a fill-in. He’s knocking on the door of consistent defensive snaps.\nMagee may not start the season as a household name, but if his trajectory continues upward, fans will soon know exactly who No. 58 is. As a spark plug behind stars, Magee is the kind of developmental player who could quietly become a crucial piece of a championship-caliber defense.",
