  "text": "WHITE RIVER JUNCTION, Vt. — Monday was a SwampBats takeover at the New England Collegiate Baseball League All-Star Game at Upper Valley’s Maxfield Sports Complex.\nThe festivities, which were postponed from Sunday due to inclement weather, were full of purple and black flare, with nine SwampBats making the North Division All-Stars roster along with manager Shaun McKenna and assistant coaches Casey O’Brien and Stephen Bangs on staff.\nThe North Division took down the South Division in a tight 3-1 contest in front of an Upper Valley record-breaking 1,745 in attendance.\nAll nine Bats saw action, and outfielder Jack Herring earned the John Watterson MVP award after driving in the game’s opening run in the first inning with an RBI double.\nAfter a dominant summer campaign, Finbar O’Brien (Newport, Gonzaga) earned the start for the South Division. Facing a tough top of the lineup, however, O’Brien gave up a leadoff walk to Ty Mainolfi (Keene, Boston College) and he was plated on Herring’s MVP-clinching double. Jaylen Hernandez (Vermont, Winthrop) made it back-to-back RBI doubles with a line drive opposite field shot, giving the North an early 2-0 lead after the first inning.\nThe North Division added another run in the bottom of the second, despite not recording a hit. Lead-off walks continued to plague the South, as Ryan Kolben (Sanford, UMass) and Trey King (Sanford, Georgia) reached to open the inning. A groundout placed the runners on second and third, and Brendan Sencaj (Sanford, Bentley) delivered with a hard ground ball that ate up the shortstop, extending the lead to 3-0.\nPersistent pitching and stout defense were the themes for the rest of the game. While the South Division finished with six hits, one more than the North, they could not string anything together outside of the top of the fifth on a Kyle Branch (Oklahoma, Newport) single, a Garrett Larsen (Yale, Danbury) hit by pitch, and an RBI single from Sebastian Mexico (Louisiana Tech, Valley). Team South also failed to capitalize on a bases-loaded opportunity in the eighth after two walks and a hit by pitch.\nTodd Kniebbe (Keene, Kansas State) shut down the South Division in the top of the ninth in a 1-2-3 inning to earn the victory and pick up the save. However, the bottom of the ninth was still played to accommodate the reserves and showcase their talents in front of the scouts. During this extra play, the North had the bases loaded but could not add to its lead.\nThe North Division sees Keene sit comfortably in first with a 26-11 record, with the second-place Sanford Mainers 7.5 games back at 18-18. The North Adams SteepleCats (16-18) and All-Star Game host Upper Valley Nighthawks (15-19) round out the current playoff picture, but the North Shore Navigators (14-20) and Vermont Mountaineers (13-24) are not out of it yet.\nThe South Division is much more competitive, with the Bristol Blues (24-12), Newport Gulls (21-14), and Martha’s Vineyard Sharks (21-16) all within four games of first place. The Mystic Schooners (17-20), Valley Blue Sox (16-19), Ocean State Waves (15-20), and Danbury Westerners (14-19) are currently battling for fourth place and the final playoff spot as the 2025 regular season nears a close.\nHere’s how each SwampBat did in the NECBL All-Star Game:\nBen Rabatin (Kent State) got the start on the mound for the North, securing the win in his inning of work. Rabatin worked into some trouble, but pitched out of it as he struck out two batters.\nIn the bottom half of the first inning, Ty Mainolfi (Boston College) led off for the North with a walk. After advancing to second on a groundout, Jack Herring (East Carolina) was set up for an RBI knock, bringing Mainolfi in.\nMainolfi was 0-for-2 with a walk, strikeout and a run scored. Herring finished 1-for-3 with a double and two strikeouts.\nMarshal Lipsey (Florida Atlantic) drew a pair of walks.\nRipken Reese (Kent State), who represented the SwampBats in the home run derby prior to the game (hitting 3 home runs), recorded a hit in his only plate appearance.\nMichael O’Brien (Arkansas-Little Rock) and Nick Romano (Florida Atlantic) each came on off the bench in the game, and each went 0-for-2 with a strikeout.\nSwanzey native Ben Dean (Duke) came in for relief in the sixth inning and allowed three straight base runners, but didn’t allow any damage to come of it after striking out two straight to end the inning.\nCloser Todd Kniebbe (Kansas State) shut the door with the save in the ninth. He was the third SwampBats pitcher to make an appearance and not allow a run. Kniebbe struck out two batters as he retired the side in order.",
