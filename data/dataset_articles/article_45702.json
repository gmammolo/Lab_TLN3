  "text": "- HI Mobility said contrary to the claims made in the media reports, all salary payments to its cross-border bus drivers have been made in full and in accordance with the terms of their employment contracts and in compliance with statutory regulations.\nKUALA LUMPUR (July 23): HI Mobility Bhd (KL:HI) has denied claims that it reduced the salaries of its cross-border bus drivers, stating that all payments have been made in full and in accordance with employment contracts and statutory regulations.\nThe Johor-based public transport company was responding to media reports alleging wage cuts following a walkout by some of its drivers operating under the Causeway Link brand on Monday. Causeway Link provides bus services between Johor Bahru and Singapore.\nThe bus driver strike caused HI Mobility’s share price to decline as much as 4.4% to RM1.74 on Wednesday, before recouping part of the losses to close at RM1.79, down three sen or 1.7%, for a market capitalisation of RM895 million.\nThe stock is up 46.7% since its listing in March this year at an issue price of RM1.22 per share.\nIn a statement released on Wednesday (July 23), HI Mobility said contrary to the claims made in the media reports, all salary payments to its cross-border bus drivers have been made in full and in accordance with the terms of their employment contracts and in compliance with statutory regulations.\nThe company also noted that its drivers are paid bi-weekly and are eligible for performance-based incentives, with monthly gross pay ranging from RM3,300 to more than RM4,300 for “high-achieving drivers”.\nHI Mobility added that it upholds strict compliance with labour laws while consistently ensuring timely compensation for its employees.\nDoes Malaysia have what it takes to become a Blue Zone, marked by health and longevity?
