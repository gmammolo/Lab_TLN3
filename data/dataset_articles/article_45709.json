  "text": "Outstanding Performances’: 2 Long Island Ducks Make All-Star Team\nCENTRAL ISLIP, NY — Two rising stars from the Long Island Ducks are earning league-wide recognition for their red-hot first-half performances. Catcher Ronaldo Flores and outfielder River Town have both been named to the 2025 Atlantic League of Professional Baseball (ALPB) Mid-Season All-Star Team, league officials announced this week.\nThe selections, made by the league’s 10 field managers, shine a spotlight on the Ducks’ strong showing this season and highlight the impact of two first-year players who’ve quickly become fan favorites.\nFlores, 23, has been dominant at the plate, leading the entire Atlantic League with a .362 batting average through the first half. His powerful swing has delivered 7 home runs, 30 RBIs, and a team-best .546 slugging percentage. He also notched a 14-game hitting streak, the longest by any Duck this season.\nTown, equally impressive, has showcased all-around excellence. The speedy outfielder is fifth in on-base percentage (.429) and tenth in batting average (.327), with 6 home runs, 36 RBIs, 38 runs scored, and 17 stolen bases. His .950 OPS leads the team and ranks among the best in the league.\n“Congratulations to Ronaldo and River on being recognized for their outstanding performances,” said Ducks manager Lew Ford. “They’ve made an immediate impact on this team, and it’s great to see their hard work and talent honored at the league level.”\nThe Ducks finished the first half seven games above .500, and the contributions from Flores and Town have been key to their success.\nFans can catch the All-Star action later this summer, where the Ducks’ newest stars will represent Long Island on the league’s biggest stage. Until then, the second half of the season promises more fireworks — and these two are just getting started.\nFor updates, subscribe to our free newsletter!\nSupport your local news!\nMore News from Central Islip\nLove and Light’: Beloved Gastropub Reopens as New Italian Eatery on LI’s South Shore By Samantha Vogel-HesposLove and Light’: Beloved Gastropub Reopens as New Italian Eatery on LI’s South Shore\nBy Samantha Vogel-HesposA Decade of Heartache: Families Demand Accountability 10 Years After North Fork Limo TragedyA Decade of Heartache: Families Demand Accountability 10 Years After North Fork Limo Tragedy",
