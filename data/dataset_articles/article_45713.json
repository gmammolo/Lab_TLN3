  "text": "A well-known Texan is teaming up with other local organizations and businesses to support the Central Texas flood relief efforts.\n\"We knew people, like so many did,\" Mark Cuban said. \"My son went to the sister camp six, seven years ago. We had friends. We had relatives. I mean, it impacted us like so many other people in all of Texas.\"\nCenter mobilizes quickly after floods Cuban said after the Central Texas floods, it didn't take long for the Mark Cuban Heroes Basketball Center to mobilize.\nThey're partnering with other local organizations and businesses to identify the needs in Kerr County.\nSupport extends to relief workers Now, help is arriving not just for flood victims, but for those helping them.\n\"People who are really that committed to helping and supporting people, they often put themselves last and one of the things they don't think about is hydration,\" Cuban said.\nHydration kits packed with supplies That's why they're putting together hydration kits stocked with cooling towels, neck fans, bottled water, insulated coolers and more.\n\"It's just heartbreaking to see families having to go through that experience, just life changing and for us it's always how do we step in and help,\" said Trina Terrell-Andrews, CEO of the Mark Cuban Heroes Basketball Center.\nShe said they are preparing 500 kits, with the goal of starting deliveries to Central Texas next week.\nGratitude for first responders To all the first responders working around the clock, Cuban had a message:\n\"Thank you!\" he said. \"You know there's no amount of words, there's no amount of thanks that can really convey just how important you are to the families that have been impacted.\"\nThey're planning to continue being supportive as long as they're needed.\nMore from CBS News North Texas teen turns heartfelt song into flood relief for Central Texas Hill Country flood fund raises $60 million, but residents say help is slow Texas special session begins, but will Democrats stick around?
