  "text": "NEW ORLEANS — A New Orleans East dessert shop was struggling to gain traction — until one viral post changed everything.\nShakairione Johnson, owner of The Sweet Tooth Fairy, had quietly shared with a friend that she might have to shut down her bakery due to slow business and limited visibility.\nThe message was posted publicly, and that’s when local influencer Supa Cent (@Supa_Cent) — known for her millions of followers and massive online reach — saw it.\n“I grabbed my kids and went over there… I just wanted it to be a big deal,” Supa told WWL.\nIt was.\nBy the weekend, Johnson’s shop had sold out — for the first time since opening in her brick-and-mortar location last year.\n“They sold me out — more than once,” Johnson said. “I’ve been overwhelmed in the best way. I actually need staff now!”\nShe calls Supa her longtime role model, and says her influence did more than drive sales — it breathed new energy into her business.\nThe ripple effect extended to St. Noir, a Black-owned coffee shop that opened three months ago in the St. Roch neighborhood.\nSupa also posted about it, sharing her candid impressions and even conducting a poll for her audience.\n“About 80% of her followers had never heard of us,” said co-owner Avione Pazon. “She really broadened our reach.”\nFor Supa, born and raised in New Orleans, it’s about using her platform for good.\n“My goal is to shed light on businesses — because I have a business, and I know how life-changing support can be,” she said. “The Supa Effect isn’t about going viral. It’s about visibility. It’s about giving everyday people a shot to thrive.”\nIn neighborhoods where foot traffic is slow and marketing budgets are limited, a single post from someone like Supa can generate weeks’ worth of revenue — or even reenergize a brand.\n“I think we need more Black businesses in the East,” Supa said. “If we want to change the East, we have to invest in it — with brick-and-mortars, with community support, with love.”\nThe Sweet Tooth Fairy is no longer at risk of fading into the background. Johnson says she's excited for what’s ahead — and grateful that someone from her city helped shine the light.\nBusiness locations:\nThe Sweet Tooth Fairy: 9301 Lake Forest Blvd. Ste. 113\nSt. Noir Cafe: 1128 St. Roch Ave.\n► Get breaking news from your neighborhood delivered directly to you by downloading the new FREE WWL-TV News app now in the IOS App Store or Google Play.",
