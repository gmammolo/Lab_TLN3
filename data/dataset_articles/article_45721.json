  "text": "From 1984 to 1982, America had a standing Thursday night date with the Huxtables. The Cosby Show was the ultimate family comedy that not only made us laugh but also helped us learn valuable life lessons. Macolm-Jamal Warner played Theo Huxtable, the only son of Cliff and Clair. For eight seasons, we watched Theo grow from a goofy kid to an accomplished young man. Much like the character he played, Malcolm-Jamal Warner also grew up during that time. Sadly, he died suddenly on July 20 while swimming in Costa Rica. Though bystanders tried to save him, he tragically drowned. The news shocked fans and those who loved him.\nVideos by InspireMore\nRegina King Shared Her Grief Over Malcolm-Jamal Warner’s Death On Instagram\nShe posted a photo of Malcolm-Jamal Warner, whom she dated from 2011 to 2013, on her Instagram Story.\n“Some people leave a lasting imprint, not just for who they were but for the energy they carried. I’m sending prayers filled with love and understanding to your family and loved ones. Rest easy, Malcolm-Jamal Warner,” she wrote.\nAccording to Entertainment Weekly, Kelly Ripa also took a moment to remember Malcom during the July 22 broadcast. She shared an interesting fact about Live’s first guest.\n“There’s a lot of sad news in the news, so I guess we’ll just get to it and then try to do a hard pivot afterwards,” Kelly said. “I can’t believe this, because [[producer Michael] Gelman](https://ew.com/mark-consuelos-makes-live-producer-michael-gelman-cry-11772245) was telling me backstage that the very first episode of this show, Malcolm-Jamal Warner was a guest on.”\nKelly then shared what a lot of people felt about the news.\n“He shockingly and sadly and devastatingly was caught in this surprise high current in Costa Rica and died as a complication of that,” she said. “It’s just so sad and crushing, and you don’t realize — I literally, even though I didn’t know him, grew up with this man.”\nThis story’s featured image is by Stephen Shugerman/Getty Images.\nWant to be happier in just 5 minutes a day?
