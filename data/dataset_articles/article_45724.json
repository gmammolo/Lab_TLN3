This year, that prestigious title is awarded to the incredible Kennedy Linkenmeyer!\nGrowing up, surrounded by her family's beef cattle and pigs, Kennedy has poured her heart and soul into caring for her animals. Living with type one diabetes has only fueled her unstoppable spirit. As Kennedy beautifully puts it, \"It is not an easy thing to live with, but it has shaped who I am and inspired me to help others while dreaming of one day having a farm with pigs and cattle.\"\nShe is a true inspiration, with her sights set on becoming an occupational therapist to make a positive impact on the lives of others.\nWhen she was crowned Queen, Kennedy was completely overjoyed, saying, \"I am competing against some great and hardworking women!\"\nAll that hard work truly paid off, and she proudly claimed the title of the 2025 Mighty Howard County Fair Queen! With a fierce passion for representing Howard County, Kennedy is excited to educate children about farms and agriculture and is determined to make remarkable contributions to community improvements. She aims to be a Fair Queen whom everyone can admire and cherish.\nAs she prepares for an exhilarating week at the upcoming Iowa State Fair, Kennedy can not wait for future Friendship, Learning, Competition, and the vibrant festivities of that special Queen's Week! She dreams of one day becoming the Iowa State Fair Queen!\nKennedy is also grateful to have Kenzie Moellers by her side, who has taken on the role of MHCF Princess. The bond between them is set to grow as they attend various events together.\nKenzie enthusiastically pledged her support, stating, \"I will help Kennedy with anything she needs. I will support and be by her side no matter what!\"\nTogether, the Queen and Princess will take on numerous responsibilities, from handing out ribbons to participating in countless events throughout the fair. They are bursting with excitement for the busy year ahead and can't wait to represent Howard County with immense pride.",
