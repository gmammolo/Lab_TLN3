Photograph: Con Chronis/AAP Jack Snape July 24, 2025 at 3:30 a.m. UTC · 2 min read\nWallabies coach Joe Schmidt has recalled hulking forwards Rob Valetini and Will Skelton to add much-needed muscle for the must-win second Test against the British & Irish Lions at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday.\nAustralia were easily overpowered in the first half of the opening Test in Brisbane last week when, despite showing improvement in the second half, they could not make up for their slow start and finished 27-19 losers.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Related: Owen Farrell named on bench for Lions’ second Test against Australia\nIn front of an expected crowd of more than 80,000 at the MCG, Valetini will start at blindside flanker after overcoming a calf injury in a huge boost for the hosts.\nThe return of the John Eales medallist pushes Nick Champion de Crespigny out of the side after his debut last week. Skelton’s recovery from his own calf injury forces Jeremy Williams onto the bench.\nThe only other change to the starting XV is David Porecki – who suffered a head knock against Fiji two weeks ago – replacing Matt Faessler at hooker, while backrower Langi Gleeson also returns from injury and replaces Tom Hooper on the bench.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement After the team’s training session in Melbourne’s Lakeside Stadium on Thursday, Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt said the time spent in camp this week has been valuable as the team chases the quick improvement needed.\n“The squad has recovered well after a very physical first Test and the week’s preparation here in Melbourne has allowed us a bit more time together,” he said.\n“We took some confidence from the second half last week, but we know we’ll need to improve further against a Lions team that will bring plenty of fire to the contest on Saturday night.”\nNo 10 Tom Lynagh and scrumhalf Jake Gordon have been retained, despite facing intense pressure from a ferocious Lions defence last week.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Related: Melbourne’s rugby landscape opened up with Rebels’ demise – Storm are pouncing on the opportunity | Jack Snape\nSome had expected Tate McDermott to be given a chance in the No 9 jersey given his Reds connection to Lynagh and his impressive performance off the bench last week, but Schmidt has retained the 26-year-old as an interchange weapon.\nMelbourne product Harry Potter retains his place on the wing, while Len Ikitau and Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii remain Australia’s centre pairing as the side aims to keep the series alive for a decider in Sydney the following week.\nWallabies : 15-Tom Wright, 14-Max Jorgensen, 13-Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, 12-Len Ikitau, 11-Harry Potter, 10-Tom Lynagh, 9-Jake Gordon, 8-Harry Wilson, 7-Fraser McReight, 6-Rob Valetini, 5-Will Skelton, 4-Nick Frost, 3-Allan Alaalatoa, 2-David Porecki, 1-James Slipper; Replacements : 16-Billy Pollard, 17-Angus Bell, 18-Tom Robertson, 19-Jeremy Williams, 20-Langi Gleeson, 21-Carlo Tizzano, 22-Tate McDermott, 23-Ben Donaldson\nAdvertisement Advertisement",
