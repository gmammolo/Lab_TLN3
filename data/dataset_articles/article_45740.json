  "text": "Owners of a new Blaine business hope to become a fixture for home improvement needs.\nThe store, 1 Stop Interiors, is providing the Blaine area with materials for interior remodeling, from flooring to countertops and cabinetry as well as installation opportunities. It opened on July 1 at 1733 H Street, suite 800.\nThe Blaine location is the company’s second following the first store opening in Bellingham in 2021. Co-owner Patty Peralta said after seeing her husband and co-owner Joel Peralta install solar panel flooring for over 12 years, they realized there was an opportunity to combine both customer service and hardware knowledge.\n“It’s a lot of effort. It’s a lot of work,” Patty said. “So seeing this being real … and being able to open a new location, it feels good.”\nThe Peraltas decided to open the Blaine location after seeing that the city was in need of interior design stores. Although fresh on the block, Patty notes a distinction between the two areas.\n“I like the location. There’s a lot of traffic, but it’s a different atmosphere,” she said. “Everyone seems very friendly.”\nThe business also has its products online and offers free shipping on samples. Prospective customers can also request a free estimate for installation.\nAdditionally, 1 Stop also offers services aside from their options for interior remodeling. This includes carpet and furniture disposal, custom area rugs, commercial installations and design consultations.\nThe store is operating on limited hours as it increases inventory: from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday and Friday; from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday; and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday. The regular hours will be from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday.\nTo contact 1 Stop Interiors, visit 1-stopinteriors.com or call 360/656-6542.\nNo comments on this item\nPlease log in to comment by clicking here",
