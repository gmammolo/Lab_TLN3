  "text": "New Holy Spirit High School softball coach Tito Santiago hopes to build on the program’s success the past few years.\nSantiago, 43, was a Spirit assistant last season. He is also a long-time South Jersey travel coach and hitting and fielding instructor.\n“I’m excited,” Santiago said. “I’m happy. I’m looking forward to it.”\nSantiago replaces Dennis Smith, who rebuilt the Spartans into a Cape-Atlantic League contender. Spirit finished 15-10 last spring.\nSmith stepped down because he is becoming Spirit’s director of curriculum and instruction.\n“I need to focus on this new adventure full time,” Smith said, “to help Holy Spirit High School become competitive with our public school brethren when it comes to offering dual credit college opportunities with local and not so local colleges.”\nPeople are also reading…\nThe Spartans were 56-54 in Smith’s five seasons. Spirit won the CAL United Division championship for the program’s first CAL title in 32 years. Smith said he will continue to run and Spirit will continue to host the At-Bats for Autism Acceptance Invitational, a showcase event that features some of South Jersey’s top teams.\n“I absolutely loved coaching this group of girls over the last five years,” Smith said. “We definitely left the program in a better place than it was when we took over, and I look forward to mentoring Tito next year and watching him take the program to the next level.”\nSantiago said replacing Smith won’t be easy. Santiago said the Spartans will play an aggressive small-ball style.\n“We have similar philosophies,” Santiago said. “I’m not going to take away anything that he has built. I’m just going to add to it. We just want to keep building a family-oriented home for future Spartans.”",
