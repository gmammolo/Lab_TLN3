  "text": "WASHINGTON, Mo. ( KTVI ) — A man recently hauled in the catch of a lifetime from the Missouri River: a “monster” 86-pound blue catfish near Washington, Missouri. Wally Klein made his impressive catch using gizzard shad as bait on a road-and-reel setup. His feat required patience, strength and skill. Wally told the Missouri Department of Conservation it’s the biggest fish he has ever caught. After snapping a quick photo, Wally released the massive catfish back into the river. According to MDC , the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers are prime waters for catching large catfish, especially blue, flathead and channel catfish. These catfish often gather in deep water below dikes, in dam tailwaters, or in the mouths of tributary streams. In the summer, they’re commonly found around submerged structures, drop-offs, rocky banks and dike tips. Blue catfish in particular, like Wally’s catch, favor fast-moving water near the main channel and waterways with a strong current. The Missouri and Mississippi rivers, despite their potential, can be intimidating for anglers, especially after storms or flooding. Strong currents and deep water demand different fishing strategies than those used in smaller lakes or streams. For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to WRBL.",
