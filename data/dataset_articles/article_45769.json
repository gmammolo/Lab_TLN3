  "text": "Dan Russoman’s best story was the one about his own fight for survival.\nDan covered high school sports for The Hammonton Gazette weekly newspaper for nearly 30 years. He was diagnosed with cancer in April.\nDan detailed his fight against the disease in a series of riveting, heartbreaking and inspirational Facebook posts.\nOn April 22, he wrote:\nLong road ahead, and I’m sure there will be breakthroughs and setbacks, but I’m ready. Be sure to say hello if you see me around. Once again the support has been incredibly humbling and tremendously appreciated.\nThe posts stopped June 30.\nDan died July 16. He was 56.\nThe best thing about covering sports is the people — the players, the coaches, the fans and, yes, the sportswriters.\nPeople are also reading…\nWe sportswriters spend a lot of time together. Dan was a constant presence at Hammonton High School and St. Joseph Academy games.\nOver the past 30 years, I spent more Saturdays with Dan covering St. Joe football than I did with my own family.\nI couldn’t wait to get to the field and exchange some off-the-record gossip and insights with Dan about the local high school scene.\nDan covered high school sports the right way. He didn’t shy away from the controversial story, but he celebrated the athletes and coaches. He understood they are, at heart, just students and teachers, not professionals. Dan not only wrote stories, he took pictures, too.\nI guarantee that Dan sacrificed and missed family events to cover the Blue Devils and Wildcats.\nI don’t know them, but I guarantee Dan’s family didn’t mind because that dedication to his job is part of what made Dan, Dan. He is survived by his wife, Laura, and three daughters — Jessica, Casey and Samantha.\nAway from work, Dan loved to root for the Boston Red Sox and the Minnesota Vikings. He specialized in ranking Rita's water ice flavors.\nDan covered Hammonton High School athletic director Chris Sacco as a player, coach and athletic director.\n“This is a tough one,” Sacco said. “He was a great guy. He was a huge part of the local sports community and earned the respect of coaches, players and fans. He was a great reporter, but an even better man.”\nDan posted about more than just his cancer the past few months. He highlighted the achievements of others. He thanked the hundreds of people in the Hammonton community and all over South Jersey who reached out to support him.\nAs the disease wore on him, Dan’s posts were brutally honest:\nOn June 19, he wrote:\nQuestions stick in my head without answers. Will I ever completely be out of this bed? Will I be able to get back to work? Enjoy a “normal” life again? And, of course, will I survive this at all?\nI last saw Dan on April 1. We watched the Hammonton baseball team beat Ocean City 6-2.\nAfter the game, we interviewed Blue Devils freshman Trevor West, who had allowed one hit and no runs in four innings. We laughed as the 5-foot-4, 140-pound West told us how he watched YouTube to learn how to throw the off-speed pitches that kept the Ocean City hitters off-balance. It was the type of story you only find in high school sports and the type Dan chronicled for three decades.\nThe brief period between that day and the date of Dan’s death should remind us all — especially the athletes and coaches of Hammonton and St. Joseph — of how much each practice, game and day needs to be relished.\nOr as Dan posted on June 4 after spending his first night out of the hospital since May 12:\nTossed and turned all night but there has never been a more beautiful sight than the sun coming through the front windows this morning. When I saw it, I cried tears of gratitude.\nRest in peace, Dan, rest in peace.",
