  "text": "Pawan Kalyan’s Hari Hara Veera Mallu hit the theatres with decent numbers at the box office. The film performed well at the advance booking, and the makers have high expectations. According to early estimates by trade website Sacnilk, Hari Hara Veera Mallu collected around Rs 4.67 crore net in India on its first day for all languages. Further data is awaited. The film has also earned well overseas. According to US distributor Prathyangira Cinemas, Pawan Kalyan’s film has grossed over $600,000 (around Rs 5 crore) overseas by 1 pm PST on July 23. The film is released in the theatres on Friday, July 24 and is expected to enjoy a decent run at the box office on its first Sunday. The Telugu language film notably didn’t have a strong contender at the Indian box office on its release day.
