  "text": "Up North: Basketball court continues legacy of Brady VanHove\nBrady VanHove was taken from this world at 21 years old in a tragic accident. Last weekend, a brand new basketball court opened up in his name in Hawthorne, Wisconsin, celebrating his life and the sport he loved so much.\n“Basketball was his life. Like the kid just couldn’t put down a ball,” said Missy Haworth, Brady’s mother.\nBrady VanHove was a basketball player through and through.\nA massive Minnesota Timberwolves fan and a Northwestern Tiger from 6th grade to senior year, Brady couldn’t get enough of the game.\n“The love of the game of the basketball was from second grade until he passed away at twenty one. He knew everything else about every other sport and person, but as far as what he did, he played basketball all the time. He was shooting around at the YMCA two days before he passed away,” said Haworth.\nAt 21 years old, Brady died from injuries sustained in an industrial accident in 2020. A quiet kid in high school, but a force to be reckoned with on the court.\nBrady’s love for the game comes from his family.\n“My dad started at his house in Maple. He had a garage that had a hoop up on the garage and took him out there and started shooting around with him at a very young age and encouraged him to play basketball, took him to camps in Madison,” said Missy Haworth.\nOne of his idols was Duke University star and former Minnesota Timberwolves forward Christian Laettner.\n“He was my idol growing up, watching them play for Duke,” said Missy. “Phenomenal. He came and did a basketball coaching clinic in Ashland when Brady was, I think, in 10th or 11th grade. He went to that camp for a week and got to meet Christian Laettner and we have pictures of the three of us together. So yeah, it was very cool. He got his shoes signed by him and he never wore them again after that.”\nFive years after Brady’s death, the Haworths have the first public court in the area up and running.\n“After we lost Brady, we knew we had to do something to honor him and to carry on his legacy,” said Ryan Haworth. “One of the things we talked about was a basketball court, and thankfully the town of Hawthorne was good enough to work with us and here we are today. It’s been about a one year process from start to finish. Basically we just wanted to be able to honor Brady and carry on his legacy and other kids can enjoy it, that’s the biggest thing. A lot of people don’t even know this park is here let alone this court so it’s good to see kids using it and playing on it.”\nFriends, family, former coaches and members of the community laced up their sneakers and shot the first handful of shots on Brady’s court.\n“He should be here. I say that all the time. 21 year old kid with his whole life ahead of him. My soul aches every day without him. He literally was what I say, it sounds weird maybe, but I say he was the love of my life. The kid was attached to me from the day I gave birth to him,” said Missy. “I mean, I did everything for him. I drove them hours and hours up and down the state of Wisconsin to play basketball, I spoiled him with hundreds of pairs of fancy basketball shoes and jerseys, because he just was such a great kid and he didn’t give us any grief. “\nWhat Brady would have wanted is for the court to be put to good use, and for there to be never-ending buckets.",
