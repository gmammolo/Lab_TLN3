  "text": "Heiwa Corporation (TSE:6412) has announced that it will pay a dividend of ¥40.00 per share on the 10th of December. The dividend yield will be 3.9% based on this payment which is still above the industry average.\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\nHeiwa's Future Dividend Projections Appear Well Covered By Earnings\nA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, Heiwa's dividend was only 60% of earnings, however it was paying out 131% of free cash flows. The company might be more focused on returning cash to shareholders, but paying out this much of its cash flow could expose the dividend to being cut in the future.\nOver the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 19.8%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 51%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.\n See our latest analysis for Heiwa\nHeiwa Has A Solid Track Record\nThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. There hasn't been much of a change in the dividend over the last 10 years. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.\nDividend Growth May Be Hard To Achieve\nSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. However, things aren't all that rosy. Heiwa has seen earnings per share falling at 3.8% per year over the last five years. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend.\nIn Summary\nIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Heiwa's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.\nInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.
