  "text": "The Clinton area celebrated its high school athletes Wednesday night at the Clinton Herald Athletic Performers of the Year award ceremony.\n“It’s a difficult task to not give all of our athletes CHAPYs, but keep in mind, for every award winner that comes up here tonight, they all have teammates, coaches, family and friends that have helped them along, from the practice squad player that pushed them to those that cheered them on,” said Herald Editor Chris Baldus to the audience in the Clinton Middle School gymnasium.",
