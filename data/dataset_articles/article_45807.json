  "text": "Ozzy Osbourne Receives Tribute From LI Rock Station\nFARMINGDALE, NY — Long Island’s own rock station, 94.3 The Shark, is honoring the storied career of John Michael “Ozzy” Osbourne following his passing on July 22. Beginning this Friday at 5 p.m. through Sunday at 9 p.m., the station will host a special tributes weekend—airing fan favorites and rare tracks by the Prince of Darkness from his days with Black Sabbath and his successful solo career.\n“He pushed boundaries, defined generations, and that influence runs deep in every corner of our playlist,” said 94.3 The Shark’s station director, as reported by Patch Farmingdale .\nAcross the island, other rock outlets are joining in. Classic-rock powerhouse 102.3 WBAB ramped up its coverage midweek, with on-air personalities Joe Rock, JP, and Fingers dedicating airtime to share Ozzy stories and memories from listeners .\nThe tribute aligns with a nationwide surge of respect. Fans and musicians globally have paid their respects—Coldplay dedicated a Nashville show to Ozzy, performing “Changes,” while Metallica’s members have reflected on how he and Sharon Osbourne helped launch their early success .\nOn Long Island, this weekend’s salute offers a chance for local rock followers to reminisce during extended playbacks of staples like “Crazy Train,” “Iron Man,” and deeper album cuts. Listeners are invited to call in, request their favorite Osbourne tracks, and share their stories of what his music meant to them.\nFor full programming details and to stream live, visit 94.3 The Shark and 102.3 WBAB online. Let’s celebrate the legacy of a true rock legend whose influence still echoes across Long Island and the world.\nFor updates, subscribe to our free newsletter!\nSupport your local news!\nMore News from Farmingdale\nLove and Light’: Beloved Gastropub Reopens as New Italian Eatery on LI’s South Shore By Samantha Vogel-HesposLove and Light’: Beloved Gastropub Reopens as New Italian Eatery on LI’s South Shore\nBy Samantha Vogel-HesposA Decade of Heartache: Families Demand Accountability 10 Years After North Fork Limo TragedyA Decade of Heartache: Families Demand Accountability 10 Years After North Fork Limo Tragedy",
