  "text": "He may be known for biting the heads off of bats and doves, but Ozzy Osbourne was nothing if not a staunch supporter of animal rights. And while his antics on stage fronting both Black Sabbath and his solo band may evoke images of rebellion and theatrics, he’s since taken on some serious subjects to better the lives of animals everywhere.\nIt was that level of advocacy that led the often maligned group PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) to stand on business in the wake of Ozzy’s death and salute the man’s efforts for animals everywhere .\n“Ozzy Osbourne was a legend and a provocateur, but PETA will remember the “Prince of Darkness” most fondly for the gentle side he showed to animals—most recently cats, by using his fame to decry painful, crippling declawing mutilations.\n“Ozzy may have been the singer, but his wife, Sharon, and his daughter, Kelly, were of one voice when it meant protecting animals. Ozzy will be missed by animal advocates the world over.”\nIt’s true that over the years Ozzy has actually joined forces with PETA for various animal rights awareness campaigns, which I’m sure’s going to piss off some far-right chuds or something, but it’s the truth. From anti-fur advertisements back in the 2010 to the more recent public push for the banning of trophy hunting , the man and his wanted nothing but peace and love for all our furry friends — and that included urging people to adopt rescues, rather than seek out pets from breeders or pet stores.",
