  "text": "We’re a month out from the release of deathcore act Signs of the Swarm ‘s forthcoming act To Rid Myself of Truth and they’ve dropped the title track as a sort of return to their old school sound.\nSpeaking of the new track, drummer Bobby Crow said the new track was a collaborative effort between himself and the band’s frontman David Simonich.\n“I started writing this song after Dave and I had a chat about getting back to the roots that made us want to make stupid-heavy music. I wanted some straight up knuckling-dragging, slack jaw shit. It felt like a great way to open the album and make a statement that we aren’t here to fuck around.”\nSimilarly, Simonich said this new track has “the heaviest breakdown” on the album.\n“I personally think this is the heaviest breakdown on the record—maybe tied with closing track ‘Creator’. My favorite line from ‘To Rid Myself Of Truth’ was inspired by the recent Nosferatu movie: ‘The shrieks of two, the screams of one, the cries of none.'”\nTo Rid Myself of Truth will be released on August 22 via Century Media Records, but you can preorder your copy today . The band will also be hitting the road in North America with Mental Cruelty, ten56., Carcosa, and Face Yourself.
