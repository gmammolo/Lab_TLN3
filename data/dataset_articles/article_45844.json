  "text": "It’s hard for some of us oldheads to wrap our minds around this sort of thing, but Death ‘s Spiritual Healing and Symbolic are 35 and 30 years old as of this year. Time is a brutal motherfucker, man. You can sit around and wait for it to take you, or you can celebrate the time you have, and it seems like the touring tribute to Death and the late Chuck Schuldiner isn’t letting this shit pass.\nFor almost the entirety of November, Death To All will be touring North America in celebration of the two aforementioned albums. Drummer Gene Hoglan, who’d performed on Symbolic , said he and the rest of Death To All, Steve DiGiorgio (bassist on 1991’s Human as well as Individual Thought Patterns ) and Bobby Koelble (guitarist on Symbolic ), as well as Max Phelps (Exist, ex-Cynic) on guitar and vocals, were stoked to take on the task.\n“The time has come to commemorate a couple of milestones in the Death catalog. 30 years of Symbolic and 35 years of Spiritual Healing ! Two vastly different yet very important eras of Death. Both albums are going to be a blast to represent.”\nHoglan was cagey about whether both albums will be played in full, stating that fans should “have to catch these shows for themselves to see.”\nIn addition to Death To All, the tour will feature special guests Gorguts and Phobophilic . Speaking of the upcoming tour, Gorguts frontman Luc Lemay said it was going to be an exciting run of dates.\n“It’s with great honor that we’ll be sharing the stage with these death metal monuments. Death had such an important influence on me as an artist. It’s the band that made me want to become a death metal musician. Chuck was my idol, my inspiration. See you on stage. Be prepared for an evening of classic death metal!”\nIf you’d like to catch this show live, you’ll have to check the list of dates below to see if it’s coming to a venue near you.\nDEATH TO ALL NOVEMBER 2025 TOUR DATES:\nNov 4 – San Diego, CA – The Observatory North Park\nNov 6 – Salt Lake City, UT – Metro Music Hall\nNov 7 – Englewood, CO – Gothic Theatre\nNov 8 – Lawrence, KS – The Granada\nNov 9 – Joliet, IL – The Forge\nNov 10 – Detroit, MI – El Club\nNov 11 – Toronto, ON – Danforth Music Hall\nNov 12 – Montreal, QC – MTELUS\nNov 13 – Worcester, MA – The Palladium\nNov 14 – New York, NY – Irving Plaza\nNov 15 – Reading, PA – Reverb\nNov 16 – Baltimore, MD – Baltimore Soundstage\nNov 18 – Tampa, FL – The Orpheum\nNov 19 – Baton Rouge, LA – Chelsea’s Live\nNov 20 – Houston, TX – White Oak Music Hall\nNov 21 – Dallas, TX – The Echo Lounge & Music Hall\nNov 22 – San Antonio, TX – Vibes Event Center\nNov 24 – Albuquerque, NM – Sister\nNov 25 – Mesa, AZ – The Nile Theater\nNov 26 – Las Vegas, NV – House of Blues\nNov 28 – Los Angeles, CA – The Belasco\nNov 29 – Santa Ana, CA – The Observatory\nNov 30 – San Francisco, CA – The Regency Ballroom",
