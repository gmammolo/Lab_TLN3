  "text": "“I need to introduce my new teammates, because I will be joining the Atlanta Dream, yo!” But Brittney Griner wasn’t the only one excited for her stint under the new team. The Atlanta Dream welcomed Griner with a #42 Brittney Griner Collection. While the franchise launched Rebel Edition Nike jerseys under the banner, Indiana Fever was not far behind. Instead of launching a player-specific collection, the Fever went overboard and came up with a Stranger Things inspired uniform.\nAs one of the most beloved thriller web series on Netflix, Stranger Things has a deep-rooted connection with the team. Indiana Fever and Nike introduced a Rebel Edition jersey inspired by ST in April 2021 to celebrate 25 successful years of the WNBA. Featuring a dark red and black palette, the jerseys included a stylised red-printed font from the series. It also featured Demogorgon claw accents and a hidden tribute to the show that is set in Hawkins, Indiana.\nMoreover, the jerseys also featured the team name flipped upside-down and number 011 engraved on the waistband. Needless to say, the most creative jersey designs created an uproar among fans. As one of the most visually striking jerseys hit the stores, fans were quick to grab the limited edition. Well, even Caitlin Clark could not help but praise the jersey. When a fan wearing the design met Clark last year, the superstar made a harmless comment, suggesting, “I think we should bring that jersey back.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nThe Indiana Fever took note of the statement. Taking a hilarious jab at Caitlin Clark’s statement, the account shared an eight-second clip on X (former Twitter). “Say less, CC,” the official account captioned. “Caitlin Clark saw a fan wearing our original Stranger Things jersey from 2021 and she had one request…bring it back.”\nPoll of the day\nPoll 1 of 5\nAD\nThe clip details a throwback incident from last year where interacting with a fan after a photo session led to Clark making the request. And now the Fever not only listened but actually acted upon it.\nsay less, CC 🔥\nCaitlin Clark saw a fan wearing our original Stranger Things jersey from 2021 and she had one request…bring it back 😈\n[pic.twitter.com/gSjOyMTz7a]— Indiana Fever (@IndianaFever)\n[July 23, 2025]\nYes, the Indiana Fever officially relaunched the Stranger Things jersey collection in collaboration with Netflix on July 23, 2025. “This jersey represents the fierce spirit of our team and the fearless energy of Stranger Things – two forces that never back down,” Indiana Fever Chief Operating Officer and General Manager Amber Cox said. “As we celebrate our team and the cultural phenomenon that is Stranger Things, we’re thrilled to bring back this awesome collaboration with Netflix.”\nThis limited edition jersey has reimagined Fever’s classic look with a dark retro twist, adding a dash of eerie black and red hues to the otherwise blue and red uniforms. This time around, Clark too features in the poster, owning the outfit.\n[Caitlin Clark, Paige Bueckers Boost WNBA Credentials With Different Global Pop Culture Forays]\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nStranger Things jerseys are back—are they the coolest sports merch you've ever seen?\nHave an interesting take?\nThis move by the franchise comes ahead to the series’ most-anticipated release of Season 5. “Now You Know, Things Are Getting Stranger Here. From Hawkins, Indiana to Gainbridge Fieldhouse …We’re stepping out of the ordinary and bringing back Stranger Things jerseys ahead of ST5 this fall,” the team announced on social media. The reel features Fever locker room on a ragged basketball court as red skies blanket the city of Indianapolis.\nHaving said that, these limited edition jerseys are up for grabs in adult and youth sizes from July 23 onwards. But marketing aside, the Fever will be back on court on the 24th, facing the Las Vegas Aces. They have faced each other twice now, tying the series. Can they wrap it with a win?\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nUpdate on Caitlin Clark remains unclear\nWhile her comeback brought respite to the Indiana Fever locker room, Clark’s injuries caused havoc. Her right groin injury heightened during the game against the Connecticut Sun, urging her to leave the game midway. With her playing status updated as Out, there is no clear timeline of her return.\nIndyStar sports reporter Chloe Peterson further clarified Indiana Fever head coach Stephanie White‘s stance on the matter. “Stephanie White says there’s no update on Caitlin Clark or a potential timeline,” Peterson reported on X. “Clark met with another doctor this morning, but White says she hasn’t spoken with trainers about that yet.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nStephanie White’s potential update regarding the star athlete came just hours before the team dived into another game against the New York Liberty, which eventually resulted in yet another loss.\nWith Clark’s return dipped in ambiguity and Fever’s roster juggling with a two-game losing streak, can HC White lead the team back on course? Or will Indiana Fever keep hanging on to the center of the league’s regular standings? With an aspiration to win the title this season, Indiana Fever can no longer afford to bag losses.\nADVERTISEMENT\nStranger Things jerseys are back—are they the coolest sports merch you've ever seen?\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT",
