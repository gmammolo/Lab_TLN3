  "text": "Interested in getting The Pine Bluff Commercial's Newsletter delivered to your inbox every morning?\nIn a powerful testament to redemption and the enduring human spirit, the Rev. Charles Banks, once entrenched in the perilous world of gang life in southeast Arkansas, has emerged as a beacon of hope, now serving as a devoted church pastor. His journey, marked by hardship and profound transformation, offers a compelling narrative of how faith and determination can pave the way for a new purpose.\nBanks, an original-gangster Crip member in the 1990s, who transformed his life to become a church pastor, shared his powerful testimony Tuesday at the Trinity Community Learning Center's summer camp. The event, organized by program coordinator Jackie Brimsley, aimed to provide young people with a compelling message of hope and redemption.\nBrimsley, a long-time friend of Banks, felt a strong calling to invite him to speak. \"The Lord put him on my heart to call and ask him all the way in Louisiana to come and speak to the young people here, because I knew he had a word for them,\" she explained.\nBanks shared his raw and unfiltered experiences, painting a vivid picture of the destructive path he once trod. He spoke candidly about the allure of gang life, the false sense of toughness, and the brutal realities that ultimately lead to imprisonment, injury, and even death. His profound words echoed, detailing the clear division between a life of aggression and one committed to learning and constructive transformation.\n\"You want to go somewhere in life and be something, pick up something productive,\" Banks implored, emphasizing the importance of choosing a path far removed from the streets. He reflected on the regret of past choices. \"If I can do it again, I wish I could do it all over,\" said Banks.\nBanks has shared his story he titled \"From Crip to Christ,\" of what he describes as being a former gangster, drug dealer and drug user, which led him to prison. He was also featured in the 1994 HBO documentary \"Gang War: Bangin' in Little Rock.\"\nBanks said it is precisely these past experiences that now fuel his mission to guide others away from similar pitfalls.\nBanks is now a member of Faith, a peaceful gang.\n\"God has changed me and set me free from the drugs,\" said Banks.\nA poignant moment in his discourse involved a visual demonstration using a body bag, starkly illustrating the ultimate consequence of gang involvement. \"This is a body bag when they put dead folks in,\" he explained, driving home the message that a life of crime often ends in tragedy and a loss of freedom.\nHe also shared personal scars, revealing a \"scar on my leg\" and explaining he had been shot and stabbed, tangible reminders of the violence he endured.\nBanks stressed the importance of education, urging the children to \"go get your education\" and \"don't do drugs, don't join gangs.\"\n\"If you fall, get back up and keep on running. Don't let nobody tell you that you can't get this,\" he said.\nNow a pastor with 12 children and a program in Louisiana called \"Road to Success,\" Banks embodies the very transformation he preaches. He speaks with the authority of someone who has lived through the darkness and emerged into the light, using his own life as a powerful example. Banks now devotes his time to his family, his church, and his community with a desire to see \"every last one of y'all be successful.\"\nBrimsley spoke on how Banks' story is a powerful reminder that change is possible, no matter how daunting the past may seem. She explained how Banks' story resonates deeply with the challenges many young people face today, including the pressures of drugs, alcohol and negative peer influences.\n\"Children now have a whole lot of things to deal with, like drugs, alcohol, and wrong friends. All of that,\" she said. \"Charles has been through all that ... he can tell them how they would make a mistake by going the route he went, and he can show them how he went from gang member ... to pastor in a church. And that's amazing. That's a really amazing story.\"",
