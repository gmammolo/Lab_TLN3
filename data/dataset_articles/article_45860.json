  "text": "23rd Jul 2025\nWhile organising her upcoming fundraiser for Gaza, Irish artist Rosie Keane found that taking action—even small, local action—can be a powerful way to reconnect with hope and the strength of community. She shares some advice for those who want to set up their own local fundraiser, and details of her Paint for Peace event, taking place on Thursday, July 24.\nLike many others, I’ve found myself scrolling through footage and news updates from Gaza, feeling overwhelmed and powerless. Even with the strength of protests, marches, and heartfelt solidarity here in Ireland, the sheer scale of suffering can feel paralysing.\nThat feeling of helplessness sparked a conversation between myself and fellow artists Laragh McCann and Talita Marcillo. We talked about the power of small, positive actions as an antidote to doom-scrolling and the inertia that fear can bring—and also about the sense of calm and connection people often feel during painting workshops. We began to ask ourselves: What can we do, with what we have access to, from where we are?\nAs regular collaborators with We Are ArtClub—a brilliant, female-led Irish art events company—and with Laragh and Talita also active in grassroots climate activism and organisation, we knew we had the experience, the creative community and tools to pull something meaningful together. Alongside leading painting workshops, I also work at the National Gallery of Ireland, where I’m constantly reminded of the power of art to connect and inspire.\nWe decided to host a painting workshop, with 100% of proceeds going to humanitarian aid for Gaza via the Irish Red Cross Gaza Appeal—a trusted, transparent channel.\nRallying resources and community spirit\nSupport came quickly. The Tara Building, known for supporting creative and socially impactful work, were instantly enthusiastic and offered their venue. Our amazing managers at We Are ArtClub offered the use of their equipment without hesitation—brushes, aprons, pots, easels. We also received support from Climate Love Ireland (a non-profit, community-led organisation founded by Laragh), who have helped spread the word and are supporting us in keeping the event as low-waste as possible with plastic-free table coverings and reusable canvas tote bags for guests to take home.\nThe search for paint proved more elusive, until we posted in local Facebook groups and were met with a wave of generosity. Think mums clearing out cupboards after the Leaving Cert, or people donating leftover supplies from lockdown art projects. Along the way, we discovered inspiring initiatives like Rediscover Paint, a social enterprise that collects unwanted paint from recycling centres and repurposes it into beautiful new colours.\nWhat to expect on the night\nPaint for Peace will be a welcoming, uplifting evening designed to bring people together through creativity and compassion. The painting workshop takes place on Thursday 24 July on the ground floor of The Tara Building in Dublin city centre, with relaxing music and refreshments.\nGuests will hand-paint their own canvas tote bags (all materials provided), with guidance and visual prompts, from peace symbols to florals, ocean themes, bold slogans, pet portraits, and styles inspired by artists like Matisse, Van Gogh, Kahlo, Monet, Mondrian, Haring, and more.\nNo artistic experience is needed. This is all about expression, not perfection. Just pick up a brush and see where it takes you. There are no rules!\nImportantly, we’ll also take a moment to hear from the Irish Red Cross about the work their Gaza Appeal is doing right now in providing urgent humanitarian aid to families and communities in Gaza.\nAll proceeds go directly to the Irish Red Cross Gaza Appeal. Whether you come alone or with friends, you’ll be part of a creative, collective moment that matters.\nEvent details\n- Thursday, 24 July 2025\n- 7:30 PM – 9:30 PM\n- The Tara Building, Dublin\n- Tickets: €35 via Eventbrite\n*Booking in advance is essential so materials can be prepared in advance!\nHow to organise your own fundraiser?\nIf you’re feeling powerless, turning that energy into something productive can be grounding and galvanising. Here’s what we’ve learned from organising Paint for Peace.\n- Start with your skills – Whether you’re a baker, a runner, a crafter or a singer, begin with what you enjoy.\n- Keep it simple – Host a coffee morning, a clothes swap, an open mic night, or a community walk, anything that brings people together.\n- Choose a transparent charity – Ideally, one with direct access to the region or crisis you’re supporting.\n- Ask around and find collaborators – Local venues are often willing to support good causes, and teaming up with others can make things easier, more fun, and more sustainable.\nFinal thoughts\nIn a world that can often feel overwhelming, taking action—even small, local action—can be a powerful way to reconnect with hope and the strength of community. You don’t need a big budget or a huge platform, just a clear goal, a little time, and the courage to ask for help.\nA paintbrush might not change the world, but it can start a conversation, encourage participation, spark a connection, or inspire someone else to act.",
