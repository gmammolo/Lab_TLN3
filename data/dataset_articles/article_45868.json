  "text": "Confidence Man & JADE Unleash New Single 'gossip\nAustralian rave royalty Confidence Man have teamed up with UK pop icon JADE (Little Mix) for the most deliciously savage pop banger of the summer, ‘gossip’. Premiering as Jack Saunders’ Hottest Record on BBC Radio 1, ‘gossip’ is three minutes of strutting dance-pop perfection, a fizzy cocktail of acid house attitude, playground insults, and choreographed clapbacks: this is a collab forged in pop heaven and raised in clubland hell.\n“Talk shit get a hit. There’s been a lot of chat going round but we can finally give you the truth of it. Gossip is here and god it tastes good. JADE put the cherry on top of this pop sundae and we can’t stop eating.” - Confidence Man\nBorn in a haze of glitter, synths and side-eye, ‘gossip’ had its live debut in front of a heaving Glastonbury Festival crowd during JADE’s surprise-packed set on the Woodsies Stage, where Confidence Man stormed the stage to deliver their new collab, complete with a brand-new routine that had the crowd gagging. Festival-goers will already know the ‘Tina Says You’re a C**’ fans and flags flying high all weekend weren’t just your imagination: the lyric’s already legendary with over 6M TikTok views on the track ahead of its release.\n‘gossip’ continues an incredible run for Confidence Man, following on from this year’s collaboration ‘I HEART YOU’ with UK singer, producer and DJ Eliza Rose. Last year Confidence Man released their third studio album 3AM (LA LA LA), which saw the group popify 90s UK rave sounds with a fresh, irreverent flair. They also won Best Live Act at the Rolling Stone UK Awards and were nominated for 3 x ARIA Awards for Best Electronic / Dance Release, Best Music Video and Best Live Act. This year they took out Best Breakthrough Artist at the BBC Radio 1 Dance Awards and were nominated for International Group of the Year at the BRIT Awards.\nFollowing this year’s headline-grabbing run of sets at Glastonbury, from the euphoric madness of Levels b2b Job Jobse, to a full-blown Stonebridge Bar takeover in which JADE popped on-stage at 1am, Confidence Man have proven yet again that no one does it quite like them.\nMORE ABOUT CONFIDENCE MAN…\nConfidence Man are the undisputed masters of maximalist mischief, a hedonistic pop-dance juggernaut fuelled by fierce choreography, euphoric hooks and a healthy disregard for subtlety. Formed in Brisbane and now based in London, the four-piece, fronted by the irrepressible duo Janet Planet and Sugar Bones, with shadowy beatmakers Clarence McGuffie and Reggie Goodchild behind the scenes, have spent the last few years turning clubs, festivals and sweaty basements into full-blown temples of fun.\nTheir third studio album, 3AM (LA LA LA), released via CHAOS/Polydor/I OH YOU last year, saw Confidence Man popify ‘90s UK rave sounds with a fresh, irreverent flair. Drawing inspiration from their immersion in London’s queer nightlife and a brush with icons like The KLF, the album delivers a high-voltage blend of breakbeat, trance, and leftfield techno, shot through with the anarchic spirit of The Prodigy and the rave energy only they can conjure. It’s bold, brash and utterly addictive, a fever-dream soundtrack for the club in your mind.\nFollowing their breakout second album TILT, which featured the cult hit ‘Holiday’ and cemented their reputation as festival mainstays, Confidence Man have gone from underground party-starters to international icons of excess. Their genre-defying sound and wild live shows have earned them rave reviews, millions of streams, and a growing legion of fans who show up ready to dance, scream and surrender to the madness.\nIn their world, the outfits are tiny, the hair is huge, and the vibes are nuclear. Confidence Man aren’t just making music; they’re making a scene. And everyone’s invited.\nMORE ABOUT JADE…\nIn just ten months, JADE’s solo career has skyrocketed with over 190 million streams, a BRIT Award for Pop Act, and an Ivor Novello nomination for her breakout hit ‘Angel Of My Dreams’. That track entered the UK Top 10, amassed over 100 million streams, and was widely celebrated as one of 2024’s best songs and videos by publications like DIY, The Guardian, and Dazed. JADE’s captivating live performances — from Radio 1’s Big Weekend to Mighty Hoopla — have further solidified her place as one of pop’s most magnetic and theatrical voices. With a sold-out tour, festival headliners including Glastonbury and TRNSMT, and a special orchestral show at the BBC Proms on the horizon, JADE is defining pop stardom on her own electrifying terms.",
