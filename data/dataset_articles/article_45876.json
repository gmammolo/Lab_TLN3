  "text": "Norton Games on Classic Hits Q-106.7 & Marysville Games on Classic Country 1570 AM/94.1 FM KNDY The 2025 Kansas American Legion Baseball Class B State Tournament in Hiawatha, Kansas is set to kick off this Friday, with local powerhouses Marysville and Norton having successfully secured their berths.\nFans eager to follow Marysville’s journey through the tournament can tune into Classic Country 1570 AM & 94.1 FM KNDY in Marysville for live broadcasts of all their games. Meanwhile, Norton supporters can catch their team’s action on Classic Hits Q-106.7 KQNK in Norton. Veteran sports announcer Max Blaske will be providing play-by-play commentary for both teams on their respective radio affiliates.\nAccording to the tournament bracket, (1) Marysville (19-6) is scheduled to play their first game on Friday at 7:00 PM against (8) Hiawatha (11-14). (4) Norton (13-15) will also play on Friday at 1:30 PM against (5) Garnett (13-5). With a Marysville win, they would advance to face the winner of Norton/Garnett at 1:00 PM on Saturday. With a Norton win, they would face the winner of Marysville/Hiawatha at 1:00 PM on Saturday. With a Norton loss, they would play a consolation game on Saturday at 8:00 AM. A Marysville loss would put them at the same time on Saturday at 8:00 AM.\nThe tournament format, as indicated on the bracket, seeds Zone Champions 1-4 and Zone Runner-ups 5-8. In instances where a matchup between zone winners and runner-ups occurs, the runner-up team will switch opponents. Additionally, the tournament aims to avoid initial matchups between teams that have previously faced each other during the zone tournament.\nThe championship game is slated for Monday at 4:00 PM, with a potential “if necessary” game scheduled for 6:30 PM. Baseball enthusiasts are encouraged to follow their local broadcasts as Marysville and Norton vie for the 2025 Kansas American Legion Baseball Class B State Championship title.\nMarysville games can be streamed live in the Classic Country KNDY mobile app or online at kndyclassic.com . Norton games can be streamed live in the KQNK App, or online at KQNK.com .",
