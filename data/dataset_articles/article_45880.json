  "text": "MOSES LAKE — The Moses Lake City Council on Tuesday evening unanimously approved the publication of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for mobile outreach and supportive services aimed at helping homeless individuals access critical resources following the recent closure of the Open Doors Sleep Center.\nHousing Grants Manager Liz Murillo Busby introduced the initiative, highlighting the goal of contracting a qualified organization to provide 24/7 mobile outreach and transportation to shelters, rehabilitation programs, family support systems, and other recovery services.\n“This proposal is in alignment with the Post Sleep Center closure transition plan,” Busby told the council. She emphasized the importance of verifying services at receiving facilities, noting, “We want to make sure that the subgrantee that gets contracted verifies services... and is not just dropping off individuals without verifying those services.”\nThe RFP includes a collaborative partnership with the Moses Lake Police Department and code enforcement to ensure timely referrals with a target response time of 30 to 45 minutes.\nCouncil Member David Skaug asked about the cost structure, to which Busby replied, “Within 30 days of awarding this contract, the subgrantee will come with us with an outline plan proposal on how that structure will work.” The contract is anticipated to be about $55,000.\nCouncil discussed whether multiple providers could be selected or if the contract would go to a single provider. Busby responded that the council could direct funding to more than one agency based on proposals received. “We can provide direct or give direction from council then,” she said.\nThe council plans to review scored applications in early September with recommendations from an ad hoc homeless committee.\nCouncil Member Deanna Martinez voiced support for allowing the proposals to guide next steps, saying, “I’m for one comfortable with that to sort of let the applications guide what our next steps would be.”\nWith the RFP authorized for publication, the city moves forward with efforts to enhance outreach services to vulnerable populations in need of immediate transportation and support services.",
