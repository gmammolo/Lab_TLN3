  "text": "Mastercard and TheFork are proud to announce the official launch of their global partnership, which will bring Priceless Experiences and curated Hotspots to diners across the UK, Italy, Spain and France. This collaboration will unlock a world of exclusive dining moments and gastronomic adventures, powered by TheFork’s leading reservation platform.\nSince July 1, 2025, diners are able to relish two exceptional ways to elevate their culinary journey, both available to book on priceless.com :\nWith Hotspots, they’ll gain exclusive priority access to the most coveted tables at top-tier restaurants, making the (almost) unbookable, bookable. At the same time, Priceless Experiences will offer exclusively curated experiences in a selection of award-winning restaurants, such as behind-the-scenes kitchen or cellar tours led by their renowned chefs. Each experience is thoughtfully curated to inspire and deepen diners’ connection to food, culture, and community. In the UK, a total of 21 experiences can be enjoyed, including Hotspots at The Lecture Room and Library at Sketch, a three-Michelin-starred icon of artful gastronomy, and Albatross Death Cult, known for its cutting-edge culinary flair and vibrant atmosphere. Priceless Experiences will feature moments at Alex Dilling at Hotel Café Royal, offering masterful modern French cuisine in a legendary London setting, and Rebel, a rising star known for its creative, ingredient-led menus in an intimate space.\nLooking ahead, the partnership is set to expand significantly. From 2026 onwards, diners can expect more than 250 new experiences each year across additional countries, including Portugal, The Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria and Sweden. This expansion will continue to highlight some of the world’s most celebrated culinary destinations, restaurants and talent.\n“This partnership is about crafting extraordinary culinary moments that transcend the ordinary,” said Almir Ambeskovic, CEO of TheFork. “Together with Mastercard, we are redefining the way people experience dining — transforming every meal into a curated journey of taste, culture, and unforgettable memories.”\n“We are incredibly proud of our culinary heritage in Europe, where food culture plays a huge part in our lives as a key passion point. Partnering with TheFork enables us to connect more people with fantastic food experiences across our vibrant region” said Beatrice Cornacchia, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Communications for Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa, Europe at Mastercard.\nStay tuned for more information on participating restaurants and experiences.",
