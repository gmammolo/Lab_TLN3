  "text": "On 16 July 2025, Mae Fah Luang University (MFU), led by Asst. Prof. Dr. Matchima Naradisorn, President of MFU, along with Asst. Prof. Dr. Romyen Kosaikanont, Vice President, and Dr. Nichan Singhaputtangkul, Acting Head of the Global Relations Division, welcomed a delegation from the Consulate General of India in Chiang Mai. The delegation, headed by Mr. Pranav Ganesh, Consul of India in Chiang Mai, paid an official courtesy visit at the Reception Room, Vanchai Sirichana Building.\nDuring the meeting, both parties engaged in fruitful discussions on potential academic collaboration and exchange between MFU and Indian institutions. The dialogue primarily focused on building a strong network of cooperation that will benefit both students and staff from the two countries. Several promising areas for future cooperation were identified. These included inviting the Consul of India to deliver special lectures on Indian education system, its growth stories, and transformation. Discussions also covered knowledge and innovation-sharing activities on water pollution management and heavy metal contamination in the Kok River. To align with MFU’s emphasis on wellness education, the university would like to invite yoga experts to share insights on yoga teaching with personnel of the MFU Medical Center Hospital and Wellness Center. Moreover, both parties expressed interest in fostering student exchange programmes and research projects in medicinal plants, integrative medicine, tea and coffee between MFU and leading Indian institutions to enrich learning experiences and promote cross-cultural understanding.\nThis visit marked a significant step in strengthening the educational ties between Thailand and India, especially within the Greater Mekong Subregion. It laid the foundation for advancing joint educational and research initiatives in the years to come.",
