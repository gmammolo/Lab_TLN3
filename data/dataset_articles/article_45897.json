  "text": "1848 Ventures, an AI-focused venture studio that creates SaaS solutions for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in the US, announced leading a $3 million seed funding round for Propel People, a mobile-first hiring platform designed to help contractors find skilled tradespeople more quickly.\nThe company also appointed industry expert Dexter Bachelder as its CEO, bringing extensive experience in construction technology and go-to-market strategies. Developed within the 1848V Venture Studio, Propel People addresses one of the construction sector’s most significant issues: hiring.\nWith most contractors struggling to find skilled workers and over $20 billion lost annually due to labor shortages, their AI-driven platform streamlines and accelerates trade hiring through features like intelligent candidate ranking, instant screening, and engaging SMS communication. Propel’s proprietary ProScore engine rapidly ranks applicants, while two-way texting improves response rates and pre-screening.\nThe platform supports both English and Spanish and is tailored for contractors who work primarily in the field. Dexter Bachelder offers over 25 years of experience in SaaS, AI, and construction technology, including leadership roles at Aconex (IPO and acquired by Oracle), Command Alkon (acquired by Thoma Bravo), Togal.AI, and Slate.AI.\nThis investment highlights 1848 Ventures’ dedication to scaling AI-native software companies that address tangible SMB needs. Propel exemplifies how the studio is building and investing in vertical SaaS startups that aim to transform overlooked areas of the economy.\nHow the funding will be used: The funding will boost product development, grow the engineering and go-to-market teams, and support Propel’s expansion into key contractor markets across the U.S.\nKEY QUOTES:\n“Labor shortages are the number one threat to growth, profitability, and safety in the construction industry. Propel People was built from the ground up to address this exact problem. By combining AI-native infrastructure with a field-first user experience, Propel is redefining what hiring can look like for the trades. With Dexter at the helm, we’re confident the company will lead the next wave of innovation in skilled labor recruitment.”\nKal Amin, Managing Partner at 1848 Ventures\n“After 25 years in construction tech, I’ve learned that solving the skilled labor shortage is not just the industry’s biggest challenge, it’s also its greatest opportunity. Contractors need to hire great people to deliver quality projects, yet the industry is short more than 500,000 skilled workers just to meet current demand. Most hiring tools weren’t built for how construction actually works—on the move, in the field, and under pressure. Propel People is different. We’re using AI and a mobile-first platform to help contractors build crews faster, smarter, and more efficiently—from job post to jobsite. I’m proud to partner with 1848 Ventures to support the people who build our world and help solve one of their most urgent problems.”\nDexter Bachelder, CEO of Propel People",
