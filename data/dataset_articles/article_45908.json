  "text": "Page Action for Community Alliance prepares garden for Free Market Friday\nSHENANDOAH, Va. (WHSV) - On Friday, the Page Action for Community Alliance, better known as PACA, will be hosting their Free Market Friday event at its Shenandoah community garden.\nPACA is a coalition of organizations and community members that work together to keep children in Page County healthy and drug-free.\nThe organization hosts a series of events throughout the year, but the free market Friday events at their community gardens in Page County are a highlight of the summer months.\n“I think the favorite part is leaving with some free fresh produce,” Megan Gordon, program director for PACA, said.\nWhether it’s from the community gardens or one of the partnering local food banks, the produce harvested by guests is a key ingredient to PACA’s mission.\nThe event is scheduled for Friday, July 25th, from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. at the Shenandoah Community Garden, located next to the Valley Health Clinic in Shenandoah.\nCopyright 2025 WHSV.
