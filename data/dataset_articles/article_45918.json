  "text": "This Baseball Teams Service Dog is a Major Hit\nTugger the service dog trainee is hitting a home run with the fans.\nIt’s baseball season in the US and what can possibly beat going to a stadium, enjoying hot dogs, and cheering on your favorite team? Nothing unless you pair America’s favorite summer sport with an adorable puppy.\nOn Tuesday July 1, the Philadelphia Phillies were supposed to officially welcome Tugger, a 10-week-old service dog in training to the team’s off-field roster, according to a press release from MLB. But the game had to be postponed due to rain. He made a social media debut instead.\nThe yellow lab was born on April 24, 2025, and is named for the baseball legend and marine reservist Tug McGraw. That was just two days before the golden anniversary of McGraw’s debut with the Philadelphia team.\nImportant Work\nWhen people think about service dogs, they usually think of dogs for the blind, but service animals can help people with many different disabilities or conditions, stressed the UDS Foundation. This can range from helping people with autism, muscular dystrophy, deafness, epilepsy, as well as PTSD.\nService dogs differ from emotional support animals or therapy animals that are used by hospitals, schools, and even courts to help people get through stressful times. Emotional support dogs offer comfort, but trained service dogs can do so much more.\nIn the US, service dogs have full public access rights, and this includes public buildings and transportation, restaurants, schools, and just about anywhere. Just remember that even if they are adorable, service dogs have important roles in society and are not pets.\nPartnering With Team Foster and Warrior Canine Connection\nTugger service dog training is part of a joint initiative between two nonprofits, Team Foster (an organization that has connected 500 vets with service dogs) and Warrior Canine Connection (an organization that breeds and trains service dogs), reported NBC Philadelphia.\nThe pup will train for two years before he is a fully accredited service dog, and he will be learning skills like helping with daily tasks and responding to anxiety attacks and nightmares. When his training is finished, Tugger will be placed with a vet with PTSD.\nCountry music star Tim McGraw, Tug’s son, told NBC. “The thought that this little pup will one day contribute to enhancing the quality of life for a veteran is truly remarkable. I am certain my father would have felt deeply honored to have Tugger named in his memory.”\nThe Phillies service dog initiative with the organizations was made possible through a grant from Phillies Charities, according to the press release. Tugger is the second service dog that the team has sponsored.\n“We’re incredibly honored to have a future service dog named in honor of a Phillies legend,” Rick Yount, founder and executive director of Warrior Canine Connection said in the press release. “It’s a meaningful way to carry forward his legacy — one rooted in strength, service, and impact. This special partnership with the Phillies and Team Foster is making Tugger’s mission possible and exemplifies the power of community coming together to support our nation’s veterans.”",
