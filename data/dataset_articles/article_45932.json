  "text": "Today, Governor Matt Meyer signed a package of legislation aimed at expanding opportunity, improving access, and strengthening protections for Delaware’s military families, veterans, and National Guard members. Governor Meyer states that these bills are about breaking down real barriers that military families face — obstacles that no service member or their family should have to navigate just to access education, provide for their loved ones, or be treated with fairness. Additional Information from the Office of Governor Matt Meyer: “If you serve our state or our country, you shouldn’t have to jump through hoops to access an education, support your family, or be treated fairly,” said Governor Matt Meyer. “These bills are about breaking down real barriers that military families face—and showing that Delaware has your back, both in and out of uniform.” House Bill 160 , sponsored by Rep. Danny Short, updates the Delaware National Guard education benefits program by allowing tuition and fees to be paid directly to postsecondary institutions. The bill eliminates the need for Guard members to pay upfront and wait for reimbursement—removing a key barrier for younger service members looking to pursue higher education. “This legislation will help ensure that financial barriers don’t stand in the way of service members pursuing higher education,” said Rep. Danny Short. “By covering tuition and fees upfront, we’re expanding access to greater opportunities, strengthening the Guard’s recruitment incentives, and developing the talents and skills of our Guard personnel.” “The men and women of the Delaware National Guard show up for our state in our darkest moments,” said Sen. Spiros Mantzavinos, Senate Sponsor of House Bill 160. “House Bill 160 puts us in alignment with other states in terms of honoring their committed service and ensuring that they have financial access to a quality education.” House Bill 121 , sponsored by Representative Nnamdi Chukwuocha, exempts military-run childcare centers located on federal property from Delaware’s state licensing requirements, aligning state law with federal standards and ensuring continuity for military families stationed in Delaware. Rep. Chukwuocha also sponsored House Bill 55 , which adds “military status” as a protected class in Delaware’s anti-discrimination laws—covering housing, employment, education, insurance, and public accommodations. The bill strengthens legal protections for active-duty personnel, veterans, and their families, while ensuring legal clarity for cases where differential treatment is permitted by law or regulation. “As a veteran, I understand firsthand the sacrifices that come with military family life; moving from place to place, worrying about deployments, looking for childcare, and trying to build a career or find stable housing in the midst of it all,” said Rep. Nnamdi Chukwoucha, Chair of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. “The bills Governor Meyer signed today recognize the burden our service members and Blue Star families face and will help to ensure that those who sacrifice so much for our country are not unfairly held back from opportunities.” Protecting our veterans and military families has been a top priority for me and many of my colleagues throughout this year’s session,” said Sen. Nicole Poore, Senate sponsor of House Bills 55 and 121. “The bills being signed today are more than just policy but are about honoring the sacrifices made by those who have served. Veterans, military members, and their families deserve access to quality care, support, and protections for their contributions to this state and this country. We must always remember to fight for those who fight for us – and that is exactly what this legislation does.” Governor Meyer also issued a proclamation declaring July 25 as “Hire a Veteran Day” in Delaware and presented the 2024 and 2025 Warrior Friendly Business Award to Chesapeake Utilities and Dover Federal Credit Union, two employers recognized for their commitment to hiring and supporting veterans. “When the State of Delaware stands behind our Citizen Airmen and Citizen Soldiers through legislation, it sends a powerful message — that their service and sacrifice matter,” said Major General James Benson, Adjutant General of the Delaware National Guard. “These laws ensure our servicemembers and their families are supported not only while they wear the uniform, but in every aspect of their lives. We are deeply grateful to Governor Meyer and the Delaware legislature for their steadfast commitment to those who defend our state and nation.",
