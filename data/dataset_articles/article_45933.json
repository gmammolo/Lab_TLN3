  "text": "Canka, Virtus bets on the former UCLA player: \"I can't wait to start this adventure.\" Serie A Basketball The company does not stop: on Friday, president Zanetti will announce the sponsor used in the Italian championship. di ALESSANDRO GALLO July 16th, 2025 Abramo Canka, born in 2002, grew up in Stella Azzurra and then in Roseto\nBorn in Genoa to a Kosovar mother and Senegalese father: the world Virtus welcomes Abraham Canka , raised in Stella Azzurra, passed through Roseto and seen at work, in the NCAA, with a prestigious jersey, that of UCLA. To understand, UCLA is to the NCAA, as the Celtics and the Lakers are to the NBA. Born in 2002, he will share his minutes as a forward with Karim Jallow and with Saliou Niang, who just yesterday left Trento taking advantage of a clause that allowed him to interrupt his contract in case of a call from a club of Euroleague .\nLike Jallow, Canka also shared his first words with the Bianconeri. \"I'm proud and honored to wear the colors of the Italian champions. I'm ready to make myself available and can't wait to start working for Virtus.\"\nJuventus general manager Paolo Ronci discussed the salary (a multi-year deal, meaning two guaranteed years plus options) and the reasons for the decision. \"The final part of last season demonstrated the importance of having players who are available to meet the team's needs with determination and total dedication to the collective result. Abramo was a member of the national youth teams before gaining significant experience abroad, especially considering he was born in 2002. We decided to give him the opportunity to return to Italy and welcome him into the Virtus family.\"\nA choice with a view to the future, also considering the undoubted abilities shown by Dusko Ivanovic , capable of improving the human resources at its disposal. But there's a lot on the table at Juventus: a press conference has been announced for Friday. President Massimo Zanetti will be present with the new sponsor. Negotiations are being conducted personally by the owner, who, as he has said in the past, would not ignore the idea of having one brand for Italy and one for Europe. The one presented on Friday (there's talk of a company linked to the energy sector) will be the sponsor for the championship.\nReiterating that Virtus will now have to announce Niang once he returns from the States, it's worth noting that Momo Diouf will be at the Playground—where he was awarded, but obviously didn't play. Once Niang is announced, the final piece of the puzzle would remain. Ivanovic and Ronci have agreed to sign a player who can move easily between the four and five positions. Trevion Williams, 24, who was Jallow's teammate at Ulm, is also being discussed. A drawback, given the parameters set by Ivanovic and Ronci, is that he's a center, not a four. If things are rosy, they'll be fine.\n© All rights reserved\nContinue reading all the sports news on",
