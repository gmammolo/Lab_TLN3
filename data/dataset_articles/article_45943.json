  "text": "Southeast Iowa Union offers audio versions of articles using Instaread. Some words may be mispronounced.\nFORT DODGE — Experience. Composure. Hard work.\nHowever you want to explain it, the Williamsburg softball team finds itself in a similar spot once again.\nFor the the third straight season, the Raiders have advanced to the Class 3A state championship game following a 9-1 win over fifth-ranked Albia in a semifinal Wednesday at Rogers Park in Fort Dodge.\n“We worked for this all year long,” pitcher Jersey Metz said. “It reflects our work ethic as a team.”\nThe game was close, until it wasn’t.\nThe Raiders scored in the second inning after Kalon Spratt reached on a single and eventually scored off an error.\nAlbia followed with a home run from Addie Pearson in the third to tie things 1-1 heading to the fourth.\nThe bats finally got rolling for Williamsburg in the fourth.\nMakenna Hughes brought in a run on a double, and then scored herself after aggressively stealing third and reaching home on an overthrow.\n“After they hit the HR and made it 1-1, it kind of put some pressure on us,” Hughes said. “I also feel like it gave us some motivation because we know we have to score more than one run in a game to win.”\n“It was a turning point for us, like OK, we got to go.”\nWith a 3-1 lead, the Raiders added three runs in the fifth. Three straight singles from Alley Gorsh, Taylor Pitlick and Taylor Sanchez brought in two (one off an error). Metz added one more on a well-placed sacrifice bunt.\nAfter a three-up, three-down top of the sixth, the Raiders had a chance to end this one early.\nThey did exactly that, pouring on five more hits, with RBIs from Carly Rich, Gorsh and Metz.\nAfter two hits in the first three innings, the Raiders adjusted and had nine the following three innings.\n“She was pitching a lot of riseballs early,” Hughes said. “Throughout she started switching her pitches, so getting on top of the first one was good as the game went on.”\nMetz allowed just three hits, and for the second straight game, allowed none after giving up a home run.\nAlbia totaled four errors to Williamsburg’s zero. Mistake-free defense has been a critical part of the Raiders’ run to this point.\n“Our mentality is whatever the game situation is, just try to make the next right play,” Williamsburg Coach Adam Berte said.\n“When you can focus on what the right next play is, it helps makes the situation not too big.”\nNo. 2 Williamsburg (35-7) will face a familiar opponent from last year’s championship run in No. 1 Dubuque Wahlert (37-7). The Raiders defeated the Golden Eagles in the state semifinals last year.\nThe Raiders will be playing for history, aiming for a third straight state championship.\n“We’re super-excited,” Hughes said. “It’s an amazing opportunity and we’re grateful.”\nDubuque Wahlert defeated PCM 7-1 in the other semifinal. The 3A championship will be Friday at 2:30 p.m.\nWILLIAMSBURG 9, ALBIA 1 (6 INNINGS)\n(3A state semifinal, at Rogers Park)\nAlbia...............0 0 0 1 0 0--1 3 4\nWilliamsburg...0 1 0 2 3 3--9 11 0",
