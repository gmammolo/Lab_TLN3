  "text": "-- In a traditionally male-dominated industry, Gorilla Building stands out — not just for breaking barriers, but for building one of Mississippi’s most respected commercial construction and roofing companies. Founded in 1998 by Carol Wilson, this family-owned business has grown into a trusted name for commercial steel building projects, commercial and residential roofing, directional boring, commercial flooring, and luxury outdoor construction.\nWith the bold slogan “Built Strong. Built Right. Built by Gorilla Building,” the company is known for delivering durable, high-performance results — on time, on budget, and with zero compromise on quality. Their reputation is rooted in clear communication, jobsite discipline, and a commitment to doing every job right the first time.\nAs owner and founder, Carol Wilson remains actively involved in operations, ensuring every project meets Gorilla’s high standards. She brings decades of hands-on experience and a deep understanding of what it takes to run a successful commercial construction business in Mississippi. Her leadership has helped shape Gorilla Building into a name synonymous with reliability and professionalism.\nTeam members like Kolby Bex play a key role in upholding that reputation in the field. With a sharp eye for detail and a passion for craftsmanship, Kolby ensures every job — whether a roofing installation or a steel structure — is completed with precision and pride. “We don’t cut corners,” he says. “If we’re putting our name on it, it’s going to be built to last. We’ve built our reputation on that.”\nThat reputation has been earned through years of five-star reviews, word-of-mouth referrals, and long-standing relationships with clients across the state. Whether it’s residential roof replacement, steel building construction, or underground directional boring for utilities, clients return to Gorilla Building because they value the honesty, timelines, and consistently high-quality results.\nGorilla Building proudly installs Atlas Roofing shingles, manufactured right here in Mississippi. These premium shingles are produced in Meridian, MS, and are known for their durability, curb appeal, and long-term performance — making them a perfect match for Gorilla’s commitment to quality on every residential roofing project.\nLed by Carol Wilson and her husband Todd, Gorilla Building continues to raise the bar for Mississippi construction companies. Todd holds an unlimited state builder’s license, brings decades of field experience, and manages all of the company’s digital marketing — blending traditional expertise with modern strategy.\nOne longtime client put it best:\n“Todd and Carol are the real deal. Honest, hard-working, and always looking out for your best interest. They gave us advice we didn’t even know we needed — and it saved us time and money. You won’t find a more trustworthy team in this business.”\nTogether, Carol and Todd ensure Gorilla Building remains family-owned, hands-on, and deeply committed to doing things the right way. They’ve built not just a company — but a reputation for trust, quality, and long-term value.\nWith a skilled team, proven leadership, and a foundation built on integrity, Gorilla Building continues to lead Mississippi in commercial construction and roofing services — one project at a time.\nContact Info:\nName: Todd Wilson\nEmail: Send Email\nOrganization: Gorilla Building\nAddress: 130 Dyess Road Ridgeland MS 39157\nPhone: (601) 709-3636\nWebsite: https://gorillabuilding.com\nRelease ID: 89164039",
