This milestone marks a significant step in Timeline’s rapid expansion within the UK financial services sector and underscores its growing influence in modernising financial planning.\nSince launching, Timeline has delivered a suite of adviser-centric tools, evidence-based investment portfolios, and streamlined workflows that collectively aim to enhance the efficiency and scalability of financial advice practices. The firm’s achievement of £10 billion in AUM is a significant validation of this mission.\n“This isn’t just about numbers,” says Abraham Okusanya, Founder and CEO of Timeline. “It’s £10 billion of people’s hopes and dreams. We don’t take the trust that these people have placed in us lightly. We’re working to help them to plan, invest and retire with confidence, through an army of trusted financial planners.”\nHe continues: “Our journey to this point and beyond is about more than amassing assets, it’s about creating meaningful impact, helping advice firms thrive, enabling better client outcomes, and making financial planning more accessible, efficient and effective.”\nTimeline's journey to £10 billion in Assets Under Management has significantly impacted both the UK's tech and financial services sectors, creating 77 jobs. Their platform has also allowed 650 advice firms to effectively grow and scale their businesses.\nTo empower individuals in managing their financial futures, Timeline has facilitated the creation of 60,000 financial plans. Additionally, they have served 45,000 end clients through low-cost portfolios, making quality investing more accessible to a broader audience. This approach has also led to savings of up to £35 million in fees when compared to traditional Managed Portfolio Services (MPS) offerings.\nAdvisers using Timeline’s platform have completed 13,622 attitude-to-risk questionnaires, allowing for more tailored and suitable financial plans.\nThe platform has streamlined administrative processes with over 2,500 digital Letters of Authority submitted, significantly reducing friction for advisers and clients. Notably, Timeline’s PensionLab integration has resulted in an 80% time saving on LOA administration alone.\nPromoting financial literacy has been another key focus, with over 104,000 educational video views recorded.\nTimeline has also invested in the future of the profession by sponsoring a Financial Planning degree at Coventry University and funded more than 30 trainee tickets for Adviser 3.0, their flagship conference, demonstrating a commitment to nurturing the next generation of financial planners.\nTimeline’s growth trajectory positions it among the fastest-expanding discretionary fund managers in the UK, with a clear emphasis on digital integration and evidence-based investment strategies aligned to clients’ long-term financial goals.\n“The future of financial advice is digital, integrated and human-centred,” adds Okusanya. “We’re proud of the legacy we’re building - and this is just the beginning.”\nFor further information on Timeline’s platform and its adviser ecosystem, visit www.timeline.co.\nAbout Timeline\nTimeline is the integrated ecosystem built for modern financial advisers. Our mission is to empower financial advisers to help millions of people to plan, invest, and retire with confidence.\nWhat sets Timeline apart is the seamless integration of critical advice tools - including Customisable Factfind, Risk Profiler, Cashflow, Investment Analytics, Modular Reporting, Digital Onboarding Suite (KYC/AML, Digital Letters-of-Authority) and Client Portal - with low-cost, evidence-based model portfolios and embedded Trading, Custody & Tax Wrappers.\nThis unified advice-tech significantly elevates the client experience, streamlines adviser workflow, and reduces costs by providing a truly integrated technology stack for financial planning, portfolio management, custody, and administration of client assets.\nContact Info:\nName: Tom Newbould - CMO\nEmail: Send Email\nOrganization: Timeline\nWebsite: https://www.timeline.co/\nRelease ID: 89164452",
