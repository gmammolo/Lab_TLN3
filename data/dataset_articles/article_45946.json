  "text": "New Taipei Kings won the 2024-2025 TPBL (Taiwan Professional Basketball League) championship, securing a spot in the East Asia Super League (EASL) 2025-2026 season. The Kings achieved this feat after winning the P.LEAGUE+ 2023-2024 season championship, and in the 2024-2025 season, they topped the newly launched TPBL stage, accomplishing the impressive feat of consecutively dominating Taiwan's two major leagues.With this achievement, New Taipei Kings will make their third consecutive appearance in the EASL, establishing themselves as one of the most consistent teams in league history.EASL CEO Henry Kerins noted, \"New Taipei Kings have always proven themselves to be a championship team. EASL is the Champions League of Asian basketball, and this stage should gather true winners. We welcome New Taipei's joining.\"In the EASL 2025-2026 season, a total of three teams from Taiwan will participate, including New Taipei Kings, Taoyuan Pauian Pilots, and Taipei Fubon Braves.P.LEAGUE+ CEO Blakey Chen said, \"I am very pleased that New Taipei Kings, the TPBL champion, will again take the EASL stage, as collaboration between P.LEAGUE+ and TPBL has been actively ongoing lately.\"In both the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 seasons, New Taipei Kings finished second in Group B of the EASL group stage, advancing to the Final Four and achieving outstanding results for two consecutive years.\nIn the 2023-2024 season, they lost to Chiba Jets of Japan in the semifinals and also fell to Anyang Jeonggwanjang Red Boosters in the 3rd-4th place match, finishing in fourth. However, in the 2024-2025 season, they lost to Hiroshima Dragonflies in the semifinals but defeated Ryukyu Golden Kings of Japan to secure the club's first EASL third place in history.Additionally, in the 2024-2025 season, New Taipei Kings' forward Sani Sakakini and guard Jeremy Lin were selected for the \"Spalding All-EASL team.\" Jeremy Lin was recorded as the first player in EASL history to be named to the All-EASL team for two consecutive years.The Director General of New Taipei Kings, James Mao, expressed, \"It is a great honor to participate in the EASL stage for three consecutive years. I look forward to greater challenges competing against high-level teams every season. This season, we aim to challenge for the Asian championship.\"Meanwhile, the East Asia Super League is expected to announce additional information regarding group composition and match schedules for the 2025-26 season soon.[Photo] Provided by EASL[OSEN]",
