  "text": "EVANSVILLE, Ind. (WEHT) — After 31 years there is now a new lead in the cold case murder of Norman Ellerbrook, and the suspected killer is Timothy Farber, who was arrested yesterday by Evansville Police. The original autopsy in this case says Ellerbrook was found dead in his home by his roommate with blunt force trauma to the head and multiple stab wounds. Police say Farber was originally a suspect in this case, but Indiana State Police didn’t have the DNA testing to arrest him three decades ago. This case was reopened thanks to an officer who never stopped following the case and urged the unit to reopen the investigation. Lead detective Toni Walden says continued growth in the DNA testing space helped make the arrest. “It just keeps evolving and fine tuning so well that as he looked at this case, he met with me and said I really think this is solvable, can we sit down and look at it,” Walden said. ISP says new DNA testing by the cold case squad revealed a link to farber’s dna on Ellerbrooks finger nails, a knife in the home, and a rag. An affidavit says Ellerbrook’s car was also found near Farber’s home in 1993. Farber served time for a 1995 murder of a Vanderburgh County man. Records show he was sentenced to life without parole but was released in 2019 after the case was overturned in court. Police say the two cases are not connected. Farber is being held in the Gibson County Jail without bond. For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to Eyewitness News (WEHT/WTVW).",
