  "text": "Pirate Pak Day is back for another year at White Spot in support of Zajac Ranch for Children.\nOn Wednesday, Aug. 13, $2 from every Pirate Pak sold will go to the ranch, an organization that provides children and young adults with serious medical conditions and/or physical and mental disabilities an unforgettable summer camp experience. Zajac Ranch is located in Mission, B.C.\nPirate Paks are White Spot meals, including a chocolate, gold coin, served on a buccaneers’ boat to children aged 10 and under that has been a staple for about six decades.\n“Both our White Spot employees and our guests love the Pirate Pak Day experience,” said White Spot president Trent Carroll, noting this is the 13th year for the annual fundraising event.\n\"It brings to life our passion for family experiences and giving back to the community and we are extremely proud and excited to be able to provide families and young kids the opportunity to participate in an amazing program at Zajac Ranch. It is what makes it all meaningful and fun,\" he added.\nOver the years White Spot has participated in a variety of fundraising initiatives that have raised more than $1 million in support of charitable causes.\nThere will be 51 White Spot locations across the province taking part in Pirate Pak Day, including the location at 20855 Lougheed Hwy., Maple Ridge.\nPirate Pak Day will be offered at full-service restaurants only for both dine-in and takeout Pirate Pak meals, not including delivery meals.\nFor more about Zajac Ranch go to: https://zajacranch.com/.",
