  "text": "The school year has not even begun and Aamaree Gibbs’ football season is already shining brightly after having received his first football scholarship offer, which came from Missouri Baptist University. Aamaree, who plays the position of defensive end for the Bolivar Central High School (BCHS) Tigers will enter the 2025/2026 season as a junior.\nIf you have attended a BCHS football game over the past couple of years, you may have recognized Aamaree’s skills on the field wearing jersey #52. BCHS head football Coach Rennard Woodmore shared Aamaree is not only impressive on the football field, but also off the field.\n“He is an exceptional young man who excels in the classroom and on the football field,” said coach Woodmore.\nYou will be able to catch Aamaree and his BCHS football Tiger teammates this fall for Friday Night Lights for the 2025/2026 season. The BCHS Tigers kick off their season at home on Friday, August 22, 2025, against Lexington High School.\nClick here to see Bolivar Central High School football schedule .",
