Uttarakhand received the honour of being the first state to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) after independence. In Uttarakhand, with the inspiration of the Prime Minister and under the guidance of the Union Home Minister, we have implemented the UCC. We are seeing really positive results,\" Dhami said.\nHe added that despite opposition and attempts to mislead people, the UCC has yielded positive outcomes.\n\"When we were drafting this law initially and were about to implement it, several people - people who are against the system, who act as toolkits, who work with the Urban Naxal gang and with the Congress party, did not want to keep people comfortable with this in any manner. They spread misinformation and caused suspicions. But now, be it the matter of women's empowerment, women's safety or everyone's safety, lakhs of people have registered themselves under UCC. This makes it very clear that this 'Ganga' emerging out of Uttarakhand will benefit everyone in the time to come,\" the CM added.\nMeanwhile, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami welcomed Amit Shah, who is on a two-day visit to the state, saying his presence on the occasion of the centenary celebrations of Kalyan magazine by Gita Press, Gorakhpur, and the 100 years of the 'diya' lit by Pandit Shriram Sharma, has energised followers of Sanatana culture across the world.\nDhami said the Home Minister's guidance inspired everyone and added that the people of Uttarakhand are delighted by his visit and look forward to his return.\n\"Union Home Minister was on a 2-day visit to Uttarakhand. He attended the event on the completion of 100 years of Kalyan magazine by Gita Press, Gorakhpur. This energises everyone. Besides this, this is also the centenary year for the 'diya' illuminated by Pandit Shriram Sharma 100 years ago. So, his arrival on these occasions gives energy to the flagbearers and believers of the Sanatana culture across the world. He provided guidance to all of us. All the residents of the state are delighted with his arrival here. We express our gratitude to him and await his return to the state,\" he said.\nEarlier in the day, Shah, along with Dhami, inaugurated the new Patanjali Emergency and Critical Care hospital in Haridwar.\nPatanjali co-founder Baba Ramdev also attended the ceremony, where he highlighted the number of treatments offered to people to 'cleanse the body' through traditional methods.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",
