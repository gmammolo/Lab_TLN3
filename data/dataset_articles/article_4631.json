  "text": "Council’s enforcement action is helping create safer streets – and the numbers back it up\n- Westminster’s new CCTV network has captured 800 incidents and secured 80 arrests.\n- More than 2,100 fines issued for illegally dumped waste since April.\n- 600 fines for dumped dockless bikes and 196 fines handed out to rogue pedicab drivers since December.\nWestminster City Council has announced significant progress in its mission to make the city’s streets cleaner and safer, with new data showing robust enforcement and targeted interventions are making a real impact.\nOver the last year, the council has introduced a range of measures to crack down on persistent antisocial behaviour, including Public Space Protection Orders (PSPOs) giving council officers new powers, and a network of state-of-the-art CCTV targeted at crime hotspots.\nWestminster has restored and expanded the CCTV network, with 164 cameras deployed and 36 more on the way. The system is already delivering tangible results:\n- Since April 2025, more than 800 incidents have been captured.\n- CCTV footage has led to 80 arrests.\n- Three robbery suspects were recently detained as a direct result of live monitoring.\nEvidence captured on council CCTV is now routinely used by the police to support prosecutions and issue penalty notices.\nIn response to complaints about illegal car meets and dangerous driving, the council expanded its Nuisance Vehicle PSPO, which covered Knightsbridge and St James’s, to the West End last year. This has already resulted in 60 Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) being issued in Soho and Mayfair, bringing the total to 284 in 2025-26. The council’s Pedicabs PSPO, designed to deter rogue drivers and protect the public, has resulted in 196 FPNs being issued since December 2025.\nAlongside antisocial behaviour, the council’s enforcement action is making the streets cleaner, by tackling fly-tipping and dumped dockless bikes. Data from the 2025-26 financial year so far shows:\n- 941 FPNs issued for fly-tipping both by residents and businesses\n- 988 FPNs issued for other commercial waste offences.\n- And 593 FPNs issued for dangerously parked dockless bikes.\nCouncillor Aicha Less, Cabinet Member for Children and Public Protection, said:\n“Our message is clear: we will take bold action to keep Westminster’s residents safe. Whether it’s helping the police tackle crime, cracking down on fly tipping, or keeping our pavements clear of dockless bikes, we are giving our enforcement teams the powers and resources they need. And the results speak for themselves.”\nPublished: 22 January 2026",
