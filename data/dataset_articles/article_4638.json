We cannot do what we do without your support.\nPoland has played a leading role in the European Union’s largest-ever operation against synthetic drugs. The bust saw 24 industrial-scale laboratories dismantled, large quantities of drugs seized, and dozens of arrests made, including the alleged ringleaders of the network in Poland.\nThe operation, named Fabryka (meaning “factory” in Polish), was announced on Wednesday by Europol, the EU’s law-enforcement agency, which coordinated the action across six countries: Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland itself.\n⚠️ Authorities seized 1 000 tonnes of chemicals, potentially removing 300 tonnes of synthetic drugs from the EU drug market, in Operation Fabryka.\n➡️ Read more in our press release:\n[https://t.co/Ozp4ZGTmh9][pic.twitter.com/yaU8W431IQ]— Europol (@Europol)\n[January 21, 2026]\nIt culminated in a series of raids that took place last Friday and saw 20 people arrested, 19 of them in Poland. Overall, 85 people were arrested during the course of the operation.\nOfficers seized over 3.5 tonnes and 982 litres of drugs (including 4-CMC, cathinone, MDMA, amphetamine oil) as well as 1,000 tonnes of chemical precursors, which could have been used to produce 300 tonnes of synthetic drugs.\nEuropol estimates that the illegal activities could have generated billions of euros in profits for the criminal networks involved.\nThe investigation began in 2022 when police in Wrocław, Poland’s third largest city, started examining the import and sale of chemicals used to produce drugs, the Polish interior ministry said.\nThe probe later expanded across Poland and, from late 2024, Europol coordinated the international operation. Investigators found that the group used legally registered companies to import chemicals from China and India, officially for pharmaceutical use.\nAmong those detained in Poland, a court has placed four alleged ringleaders in pretrial detention for three months, while other suspects were released on bail under police supervision.\nProsecutors have charged them with offences including organised crime, large-scale drug production and money laundering. If convicted, they could face up to 20 years in prison, reports broadcaster TVN24.\nThis is not the first time Polish authorities have targeted synthetic drug production: in September 2024, they carried out a major operation with Ukrainian police that dismantled 38 laboratories.\nThat operation was also described at the time by Europol as “unprecedented”, which said that the 195 kilograms of methadone seized alone “could kill almost 4 million people”.\nPoland itself has also seen rising use of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. In response, the country’s health ministry introduced a monitoring system for opioid prescriptions earlier in 2024 to curb abuse and prevent overdoses.\nPoland and Ukraine have mounted a major joint operation to shut down synthetic drug production sites.\nAn \"unprecedented\" amount of drugs was seized, says\n[@Europol], and the biggest synthetic opioid lab ever discovered in Poland was dismantled[https://t.co/JeXrlr9bR1]— Notes from Poland 🇵🇱 (@notesfrompoland)\n[September 2, 2024]\nNotes from Poland is run by a small editorial team and published by an independent, non-profit foundation that is funded through donations from our readers.
