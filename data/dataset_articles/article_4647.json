  "text": "Belagavi City Police Announce Traffic Regulations To Ease Congestion And Improve Road Safety Karnataka DC Correspondent 22 Jan 2026 9:23 PM IST 22 Jan 2026 9:23 PM IST Private bus owners and drivers have been instructed to strictly follow the directions, failing which legal action will be initiated under the Motor Vehicles Act, according to the police. x Keeping public safety in mind, the movement of heavy vehicles within city limits has been restricted from 7 am to 11 am and from 3 pm to 8 pm.— Internet Belagavi: In a move to ease traffic congestion, improve road safety, and ensure smooth movement of vehicles in the city, the Belagavi City Police have issued several traffic regulations. These include directing private buses to operate only from designated pick-up and drop-off points, restricting the entry of heavy vehicles during peak hours, marking key stretches in the City as no-parking zones, and also regulating roadside parking on an odd–even basis on select roads.\nThe police department has addressed congestion caused by private buses picking up and dropping off passengers at busy junctions, particularly during evening hours. Areas such as Sangolli Rayanna (RTO) Circle, Triveni Hotel, Ramdev Hotel, and Dharmaveer Sambhaji Circle were identified as congestion-prone due to indiscriminate stopping of private buses.\nCity Police Commissioner Bhushan Gulabrao Borase stated that, following a meeting with stakeholders, the police have earmarked three exclusive locations for private bus pick-up and drop-off operations: Bharatesh School (Pay-and-Park area), vacant land behind the Belagavi One Centre in Ashok Nagar (Pay-and-Park area), and the stretch from Dharmanath Circle to Ashok Nagar Road.\nFrom January 27, 2026, all private bus operators must use only these designated locations for picking up and dropping passengers.\nPrivate bus owners and drivers have been instructed to strictly follow the directions, failing which legal action will be initiated under the Motor Vehicles Act, according to the police. The police have sought the cooperation of bus operators to ensure smoother traffic flow and public safety.\nAs vehicular traffic in Belagavi city has increased significantly in recent times, particularly during morning and evening peak hours when school and college students, parents, and office-goers travel. The movement of heavy vehicles during these hours has reportedly led to accidents.\nKeeping public safety in mind, the movement of heavy vehicles within city limits has been restricted from 7 am to 11 am and from 3 pm to 8 pm.\nMeanwhile, parking of vehicles has been completely prohibited on both sides of the road on two major stretches within the Belagavi city limits- from Triveni Hotel to the CBS (Central Bus Stand) Circle, and from Keerthi Hotel Cross to Sangolli Rayanna (RTO) Circle.\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )",
