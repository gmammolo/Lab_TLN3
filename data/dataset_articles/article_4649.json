  "text": "Fundraiser Underway to Support Injured Deputy Jailer\nMCCRACKEN COUNTY, Ky. (ABC 36 NEWS NOW) — A local restaurant is hosting a community fundraiser this week to support Angel Bugg, a McCracken County deputy jailer who was seriously injured in the line of duty.\nThe fundraiser is taking place Thursday, January 22, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. at The Station Burger Company inside Kentucky Oaks Mall. A portion of all sales from the day will be donated to help support Bugg and her family as she focuses on recovery.\nOrganizers say the fundraiser is meant to provide a simple way for the community to show support. Additional opportunities to contribute will also be available in-store for those who wish to help further.\nBugg was seriously injured during an inmate assault earlier this month and continues to recover from her injuries. Supporters say the goal of the event is not only to raise funds, but to remind Bugg and her family that the community is thinking of them during this difficult time.\nCommunity members are encouraged to stop by the restaurant, share information about the fundraiser, or help spread the word in support of the family.",
