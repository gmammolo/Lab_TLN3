  "text": "Key Highlights\nTether’s collaboration with INHOPE aims to provide sustainable, long-term funding for global child protection efforts. The partnership supports a network of 57 international hotlines working to modernize reporting and content removal infrastructure. Specialized forums will now feature Tether’s expertise to help law enforcement and safety organizations identify emerging digital threats. Tether, the issuer of USDT, announced today that it is expanding its financial and operational collaboration with the International Association of Internet Hotlines (INHOPE). The initiative aims to support global efforts against online child sexual abuse material (CSAM). As a diamond-level collaborator, Tether will provide long-term funding and expertise to support INHOPE’s network of 57 hotlines across 52 countries.\nAs per the official release , the firms will work to improve cross-border cooperation and speed up the removal of illegal content. The initiative is based on a shared responsibility to protect children online and ensure that reporting systems stay strong against changing digital threats.\nTether Expands Support for INHOPE’s Global Work to Combat Online Child Sexual Abuse Material\nLearn more: https://t.co/NMsmPb1VB1\n— Tether (@tether) January 22, 2026 Tether’s operational support With this expanded partnership, Tether will join expert forums and international meetings with law enforcement and technology leaders to identify new risks. The financial support is designed to help INHOPE move beyond short-term crisis management by investing in lasting systems for real-time reporting and coordinated removal of harmful material.\nSamantha Woolfe, INHOPE’s Executive Director, commented on the initiative, stating, “Tether’s diamond-level commitment represents a long-term investment in the global response infrastructure that the INHOPE network has built over the past 26 years.”\nPrevious collaborations Tether has previously collaborated with authorities worldwide to address legal requests and assist in the investigation of serious offenses. By formalizing its relationship with INHOPE, the company is connecting its technical resources with a network that has spent over two decades coordinating with policymakers and civil organizations to improve accountability in the digital space.\nTether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the problem of child sexual abuse material cannot be addressed in isolation and needs continuous support.\nHe added, “It requires durable systems, trusted coordination across borders, and sustained support for the people doing this work every day. Our engagement with INHOPE reflects a responsibility to contribute to the infrastructure that enables faster response, better cooperation, and real protection for children online, not just in moments of crisis, but over the long term.”\nFirms supporting the cause Tether is not the only player in the fintech and digital asset space working toward this mission. Both Block Inc. and Binance have formed partnerships with INHOPE to fight the spread of online child sexual abuse material.\nThese partnerships show that the industry is beginning to recognize that protecting vulnerable populations is a shared responsibility. More firms and new projects in the fintech and crypto sectors need to follow this example.\nFuture industry implications Tether’s support for INHOPE is expected to change how digital asset companies approach corporate responsibility and online safety. This is as global rates of CSAM are rising, while INHOPE is going to receive a boost in funds from Tether, which will allow them to plan for future hotlines while building stronger international standards in removing content.\nThe collaboration may also contribute to quicker response times and better protection for victims as technology advances and crosses international boundaries. This move shows a broader trend where major players in the digital asset ecosystem are becoming more integrated into global regulatory and safety frameworks to fight criminal behavior.\nAlso Read: Tether and Bitqik to Launch Bitcoin, Stablecoin Education in Laos",
