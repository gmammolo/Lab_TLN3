  "text": "By Current Staff ,\n7 hours ago LOS ANGELES - The Council voted Wednesday to spend nearly $2.7 million to keep LAPD hiring moving this fiscal year, money the city says will fund an additional 130 police recruits through the remainder of 2025–26-even as budget officials warned the decision could add roughly $25 million to the city's deficit in 2026–27.\nThe City Council approved the funding on a 9–4 vote, with Council members Nithya Raman, Ysabel Jurado, Hugo Soto Martinez, and Eunisses Hernandez voting no. Council members Curren Price and Bob Blumenfield were absent.\nThrough the action, the council approved a transfer of about $416,246 to hire positions in the city's Personnel Department to support sworn hiring. The council also agreed to send to the Personnel and Hiring Committee a proposal that would move some LAPD budget auditors to the City Controller's Office.\nThe additional hiring comes on top of a December vote that set aside $1 million for 40 recruits in LAPD's December class-an interim move while city leaders worked through longer-term funding questions amid budget concerns. By midyear, the department had already reached 240 new hires, matching what the mayor and council budgeted for in 2025–26.\nMayor Karen Bass said Wednesday's additional hiring is critical as Los Angeles prepares to host major international events and contends with historically low staffing.\n\"Since my first day in office, I have taken a comprehensive approach to public safety, from prioritizing the hiring of more police officers to launching my Office of Community Safety to help prevent violence before it happens and create safe community spaces for Angelenos,\" Bass said.\nBass said the council's action will allow LAPD to hire about 410 recruits this fiscal year and bring the force to roughly 8,500 officers. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell and other city leaders have pointed to attrition and competition from other agencies as drivers of declining sworn staffing. As of Jan. 13, McDonnell reported LAPD had about 8,711 police officers and 2,505 civilian workers.\nCity Administrative Officer Matt Szabo told the council his office identified about $3 million within LAPD accounts to cover recruit and personnel hires-dollars he said were expected to go unused and tied to health and wellness programs and general leasing. Szabo also cited savings from a labor program that allows sworn personnel to bank overtime as unpaid time off, which city officials initially rolled out as part of a broader effort to close a roughly $1 billion deficit and avert layoffs. Szabo said the program has generated about $4 million in savings so far that could also be used to support hiring.\nOpponents questioned whether the city can absorb the longer-term costs. Soto Martinez, who opposed the $2.7 million expenditure, argued the next-year impact could squeeze other departments and said the LAPD should be required to better account for its spending.\n\"We have hundreds of police officers that can't even do their job because they've committed acts so egregious they can't interact with the public,\" Soto Martinez said. \"That's really costing us millions of dollars.\"\nCity Legislative Analyst Sharon Tso urged council members to weigh timing against fiscal reality, noting that savings options remain unclear.\nShe emphasized that the question before the City Council is whether they decide to hire officers now or in the next fiscal year, which begins in July. Tso added, \"It's just a matter of when.\"\nEditor's Note: This story includes reporting from City News Service, a content partner of Westside Current.",
