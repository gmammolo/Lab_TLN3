  "text": "By Katie Moore ,\n46 minutes ago\nURBANA, Ill. (WCIA) — One Urbana woman says she’s now working on rebuilding her life after the Rantoul man who killed her boyfriend — and tried to kill her — was sentenced to 100 years in prison.\nOn Wednesday, a judge sentenced Alex Muanambuta to 100 years in prison. He was convicted in the first-degree murder of 22-year-old Nathan Gudeman, and the attempted murder of 22-year-old Katy Lassy back in November.\nREAD MORE: Rantoul man receives 100-year sentence for deadly Champaign knife attack When the judge announced the sentence, there were tears in in the courtroom, and people were hugging each other and clapping.\nLassy said that this case has torn her apart from the inside out, but she’s grateful to the judge for the 100-year sentence. With her days in court now over, she said, now, she can focus on healing.\n“Justice is served, but justice doesn’t bring Nathan back,” Lassy said.\nIn March, Alex Muanambuta went to Nathan Gudeman’s and Katy Lassy’s Champaign apartment and stabbed them both. Muanambuta was dating Lassy’s cousin, and she said that Lassy felt he was a negative influence on her.\n“Losing him was the worst thing that’s ever happened to me,” Lassy said. “And you never expect to be a widow at 23, or for someone you love so dearly to be murdered right in front of you.”\nThe prosecution said that Lassy played dead after the attack, while Gudeman ran to get help. However, Muanambuta chased him, stabbing him again, leading to his death. The surgeon who operated on Lassy that day testified that the injuries she suffered could have killed her without immediate medical care.\n“My voice is still recovering. I might have to get surgery, so that I can be able to talk louder, but I’m still able to talk. I still have some pretty good conversations with people,” Lassy said.\nIt’s the only physical injury left, but the emotional scars still linger. Lassy said that she now suffers from PTSD, can’t sleep and has no choice but to relive it every day.\nChampaign man’s child porn case dismissed; sentenced 2 years for domestic incident “What happened to Nathan in front of me will never leave my brain, no matter how old I get,” she said.\nIt’s why she said that the support of her friends and family has meant the world to her. In fact, the courtroom was full at sentencing — so full that the court switched rooms in anticipation of the crowd.\n“Champaign is an amazing town,” Lassy said. “The community has been so great and overwhelming.”\nNow, Lassy said it’s time to begin rebuilding her life.\n“I’m coaching the Centennial High School boys swim team right now,” she said. “I actually have a meet in about an hour.”\nAnd, she plans to go back to college to use what she went through to help others.\n“I’m going to school for social work, so I think I’ll be a good social worker now,” Lassy said “I’ve been through the worst, so I can help people come out of some of their hardest times because I’ve had to do it myself.”\nShe’ll be doing it in honor of the one she loved the most, “just really living my life for me and for Nathan.”\nCopyright 2026 Nexstar Media, Inc.
