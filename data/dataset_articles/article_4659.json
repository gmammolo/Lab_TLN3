Kay Ivey has announced $1.36 million in grants to seven nonprofit agencies in central and north Alabama that provide support to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and other crimes.\n“Crimes like domestic violence can shatter lives and devastate families, leaving victims in critical need of shelter, healing and help finding justice,” Gov.
