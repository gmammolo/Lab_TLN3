  "text": "New cameras and panic button system set to enhance security at Wexford-Missaukee court\nWEXFORD & MISSAUKEE COUNTIES, Mich., (WPBN/WGTU) -- County leaders are taking steps to boost safety at the courthouse, approving new security upgrades for the Friend of the Court office.\nThe board of commissioners approved a proposal aimed at improving safety at the friend of the court office.\nThe Wexford-Missaukee Friend of the Court will add new security cameras and a panic button system.\nThe upgrades will be installed by TKS Security to enhance monitoring and provide a quick way to alert authorities in an emergency.\nOfficials say the improvements are meant to protect both staff and visitors in the courthouse facility.\n“If things happen in our parking lot, things happen outside the building, our camera system has been utilized in instances like that,” Friends of the Court Director Rob Kulpa said. “And like I said, our security, that’s our main point for the building. So then having more immediate response available to them, it’s going to help out a lot.”\nCounty leaders say the added security measures are intended to give employees and residents greater peace of mind when visiting the friend of the court office.",
