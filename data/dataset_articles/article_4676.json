  "text": "From the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery\nLITTLE ROCK, Arkansas — The Arkansas lottery player who purchased the $1.8 billion jackpot-winning Powerball® ticket recently claimed the prize from the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery (ASL).\nThe winning Quick Pick ticket was sold at Murphy USA 7879, located at 208 S. Rockwood in Cabot, for the Dec. 24 drawing. The winning numbers were 4, 25, 31, 52 and 59. The Powerball number was 19, and the Power Play® multiplier was 2.\nThe lucky winner opted to receive the prize as a one-time cash payment. Before tax withholdings, the lump-sum amount was $834.9 million. The winner elected to remain anonymous.\nRELATED: $1.8 billion Powerball winner a mystery, and could remain one for years thanks to state law\nThe $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot was a landmark event in more ways than one, ranking as the second-largest jackpot in both Powerball and U.S. lottery history and spanning a record of 47 consecutive draws.\n“Everyone was anxiously waiting for the winner to step forward, but we are happy they took the time to seek legal counsel and financial advice first, as we recommended. We are thrilled that the winner is from Arkansas!” said ASL Executive Director Sharon Strong.\n“We’re proud to celebrate this moment, not only for our Arkansas winner and for Murphy USA, the Arkansas-based company that sold the winning ticket, but also for the positive impact this historic jackpot will have on our state and our mission to raise funds for in-state scholarships.”\nThe win has had a significant impact on the state. During this record-breaking jackpot cycle, Powerball generated $15,021,939 in cash sales in Arkansas while retailers statewide earned $768,267 in commissions. Now that the ticket has been claimed, Murphy USA 7879 will receive a $50,000 commission for selling the winning ticket. State taxes were withheld at 3.9% and federal taxes were withheld at 24%.\nDiscover more from\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.",
