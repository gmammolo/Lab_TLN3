Their successful apprehension of the suspects is proof of our focused efforts on fighting crime,” Binay said.\nBinay cited the police’s recent successful achievements by the local police, including the recovery of an influencer’s mobile phone, the capture of a well-known “salisi” suspect, and the detention of individuals involved in mobile phone theft.\nThe mayor noted that the quick response of the authorities validates the efficiency and vigilance of the Makati Police Department.",
