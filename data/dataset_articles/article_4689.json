  "text": "KOSCIUSKO CO. – Indiana Conservation Officer Jordan Boggs, who serves Kosciusko County, has been selected as the 2025 District 1 Officer of the Year.\nJordan Boggs “Across Indiana, conservation officers are on the front lines promoting public safety in the outdoors and protecting our state’s vital natural resources,” said Governor Mike Braun. “I congratulate the officers from each of the 10 districts who have earned this distinguished honor for their exceptional service on behalf of Hoosiers in 2025.”\nBoggs has served as a conservation officer for 10 years, all in Kosciusko County.\nIn addition to his normal duties as a field officer, Boggs serves as a field training officer, river rescue instructor, and standardized field sobriety instructor for the Department of Natural Resources Division of Law Enforcement.\nDistrict 1 includes Wabash, Miami, Fulton, Marshall, Kosciusko, Elkhart, and St. Joseph counties.\nThe district award puts Boggs in the running for the Pitzer Award, which is presented to the top overall conservation officer in the state and is selected from the 10 district winners.\nThe Pitzer Award is named after Conservation Officer James D. Pitzer, who was fatally shot while investigating illegal hunting activity on Jan. 2, 1961, in Jay County.",
