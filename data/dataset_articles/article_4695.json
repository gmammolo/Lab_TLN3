The vests are expected to be delivered in ten weeks.\nVested Interest in K9s, Inc. has provided bullet-and stab-protective vests and other assistance to law enforcement and similar agencies since its inception in 2009.\nThe program is open to U.S. dogs at least 20 months old and actively employed with certified law enforcement or related agencies.
