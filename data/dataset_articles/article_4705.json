  "text": "Steal, Sophie Turner's new six-part crime thriller, has become an instant worldwide streaming sensation a day after its premiere on Prime Video. Set in a high-rise, pension fund office in the City of London, Steal follows work friends Zara (Turner) and Luke (Archie Madekwe) as a regular day at work turns into a high-stakes heist nightmare.\nWhile reactions to Steal's storyline and pacing have been mixed, critics have universally praised Turner's performance as Zara, and Steal debuted with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 80%. Now, Steal's RT critics' score stands at a respectable 70%, based on 20 reviews, as the tensely bingeable series races to the top of the streaming charts.\nAt the time of writing, Steal holds fourth place on Prime Video's worldwide streaming chart, fourth place in the United States, and second place in the United Kingdom. Its popularity in the UK is unsurprising, as the series features a largely British cast and fits in neatly with a wealth of other similar British crime dramas, including shows like The Night Manager and Code of Silence.\nAs the show has only just premiered, Steal's place on Prime's global Top 10 chart may rise even further, with more opportunities for audiences to watch and even binge the show during the upcoming weekend.\nSpeaking to RadioTimes.com, creator and screenwriter Sotiris Nikitas shared why he chose an investment company in London as the target for Steal's heist plot. Nikitas used to work at a similar business himself, explaining, \"A lot of financial services companies in the City — a lot of money moves through those desktop computers and gets routed all around the world.\"\nThe writer continued, \"And it was just the idea of: there's a lot more money in those offices than there is in the average high street bank… and absolutely zero security. So it was basically just imagining my workplace getting robbed. That was the seed of the story. And when I thought of it, I thought, 'Oh, this is a really good idea for a thriller.'\"\nWhile Turner is best known for her work on HBO's Game of Thrones, Steal isn't her first leading role in the crime drama genre. Last year, the actress starred in the semi-autobiographical period drama Joan, in which Turner played the titular character, a talented jewel and art thief who gets caught up in the wrong scheme as she tries to make a life for herself and her daughter.\nTurner's next TV project will see her starring as adventurer and archeologist Lara Croft in Prime Video's upcoming Tomb Raider video game adaptation — a first look at Turner as Croft was recently revealed, with Turner sporting Croft's trademark sunglasses and tank top. For now, however, audiences can enjoy Sophie Turner's electric performance in Steal.\nAll six episodes of Steal are streaming now, exclusively on Prime Video.\n- Release Date\n- January 21, 2026\n- Network\n- Prime Video\nCast\n-\nSophie TurnerZara\n-\nJacob Fortune-LloydDCI Rhys\n-\nArchie MadekweLuke\n-\nAndrew HowardSniper",
