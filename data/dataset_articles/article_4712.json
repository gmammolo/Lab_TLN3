  "text": "CHIDI UGWU\nPresident Bola Ahmed Tinubu has reaffirmed his administration’s commitment to protecting lives and property by declaring national security emergencies in vulnerable, high-risk areas nationwide.\nHe authorized ramped-up joint security operations and the ongoing deployment of forces to priority zones, especially communities plagued by repeated attacks on civilians and religious groups.\nEchoing the President’s orders, National Security Adviser (NSA) Mallam Nuhu Ribadu emphasized that these measures go beyond rhetoric, backed by real-world implementation.\nAt Thursday’s inauguration of the US-Nigeria Joint Working Group in Abuja, Ribadu announced expansions in early-warning and rapid-response systems, plus a new national database for reliable data on violent incident deaths and casualties.\nThis step, he said, will drive evidence-based decisions, boost accountability, and sharpen security responses across Nigeria.\n“Alongside these efforts, investigations and prosecutions relating to attacks on religious communities have been intensified to ensure that violence is met not only with force, but with justice and accountability,” Ribadu said.\nHe stressed that safeguarding every citizen in Nigeria’s diverse society is essential.“Nigeria is a deeply plural society, and the protection of all citizens—Christians, Muslims, and those of other beliefs—is fundamental. Violence framed along religious lines is treated as an attack on the Nigerian state itself,” he noted.\nRibadu outlined a holistic government strategy blending security ops, legal action, humanitarian protections, and clear communication to build public trust and social unity.\n“We want Nigerians to know that this partnership is working, that it is delivering tangible gains, and that our collective efforts will continue to yield positive results,” he said.\nThe NSA urged judging progress by long-term trends, top-level decisions, and growing institutional strength to prevent, counter, and punish violence—not isolated events.\nHe pointed out that US-Nigeria ties extend to democratic strengthening, rule of law, West African stability, and blocking extremists from exploiting divides.\nRibadu affirmed the Federal Government’s willingness to adapt strategies, deepen collaboration, and keep the Joint Working Group results-oriented, focused on sustained gains over fleeting impressions.\nUS Under Secretary for Political Affairs Allison Hooker described the partnership as rooted in mutual goals like trade, investment, security, energy, and regional peace.\nYet she voiced alarm over gunmen abducting more than 170 Christians in Kaduna State on January 18, urging Nigeria to step up protections for Christians’ free and safe worship.\nHooker recalled President Donald Trump’s October 31, 2025, designation of Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern, noting solid joint advances since then in shielding vulnerable groups.\n“I am here today to continue and broaden that partnership,” she said, adding that talks would target deterring anti-Christian violence, counter-terrorism, attack probes, perpetrator accountability, and curbing killings, displacements, and abductions—especially in North-Central states.\nMinister of Information and National Orientation Mohammed Idris hailed the dialogue as a sign of deep strategic ties built on trust, openness, and joint duty for religious freedom and civilian safety.\nHe highlighted concrete wins from US-Nigeria military, intelligence, and security teamwork.\nThese gains feature better intel sharing and coordination between US AFRICOM and Nigerian forces in key ops like North-East’s Operation Hadin Kai and Operation Fasan Yamma.\nIdris noted US pledges for prompt delivery of long-pending gear—drones, helicopters, platforms, spares, and support—bought over five years, plus offers of surplus defense equipment.",
