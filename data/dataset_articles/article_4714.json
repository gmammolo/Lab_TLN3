  "text": "SUPERCOM LTD. +4.21% SuperCom Ltd. announced its third electronic monitoring (EM) contract in North Carolina. The new agreement builds on SuperCom's recent momentum in the state, following its initial PureOne rollout with a local service provider announced in December 2025 and the statewide procurement vehicle awarded earlier in 2025 by the North Carolina Sheriff's Association, reinforcing continued adoption of the Company's technology by service providers launching new programs or modernizing existing community supervision operations. Under the agreement, SuperCom will deploy its PureOne??\nall-in-one GPS monitoring solution to support the provider's community supervision operations. The provider is introducing EM technology into its criminal justice services for the first time and selected SuperCom as its EM technology provider at program launch, reflecting the Company's ability to support rapid implementations for service providers with varying levels of EM experience. Deployment is expected to begin immediately, with the contract structured as a recurring revenue model based on active daily units.\nThis latest deployment further expands SuperCom's footprint in North Carolina, creating additional entry points for adoption across counties and service providers statewide.\n© S&P Capital IQ - 2026",
