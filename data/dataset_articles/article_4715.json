Poor accessibility in rail travel is not just a one-off issue.\n“This is something that prevents myself and others with visual impairments from travelling with confidence.\n“I’m not always sure that I’ll be met with the right level of support to complete my journeys.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “At the best of times, it makes travel stressful, and in the worst-case scenario it can be really dangerous.”\nThe incident occurred at Manchester Piccadilly in May 2022 (Getty) Leigh Day senior associate solicitor Kate Egerton said: “Network Rail and train operators have a clear obligation to ensure that train stations are accessible for all.\n“Not only is it distressing for passengers with visual impairments to try to navigate inaccessible platforms and services, it is also extremely dangerous.\n“Whilst I am pleased that we were able to secure this settlement for Abdul, his case and continued experiences highlight wider accessibility issues across the rail network that need to be addressed.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement A Network Rail spokesperson said: “We are extremely sorry for the experience Abdul Eneser suffered at Manchester Piccadilly.\n“We let him down and have offered him our full and unreserved apology.\n“We recognise that there is much to do to make the railway more accessible for all and are working closely with industry partners to deliver these improvements across the rail network as quickly as we can.”\nIn July last year, the Department for Transport said the roll out of tactile paving across all railway stations in Britain had been completed.\nThis followed the death of blind charity worker Cleveland Gervais, 53, who fell from a platform at Eden Park station in Beckenham, south-east London – which had no tactile paving – in February 2020 and was struck by a train.\nAdvertisement About Our Ads",
