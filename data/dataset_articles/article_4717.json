  "text": "Clarice, the horror crime drama which first aired in 2021, is now trending on Prime Video in the UK, after being added to the streaming service last week. The 13-part series is a spinoff from The Silence of the Lambs – widely considered to be a masterpiece – and follows the central character of Clarice Starling one year after the events of the 1988 novel and the film. The logline for Clarice details how the show \\\"explores the untold personal story of Agent Clarice Starling\\\" as she returns to work. Here, the role of the FBI agent – previously and iconically portrayed on the big screen by Jodie Foster – is taken on by Rebecca Breeds. Clarice, which was created by Alex Kurtzman and Jenny Lumet, only got one season, and received mixed reviews from critics and viewers. Reviews on Rotten Tomatoes saw Breeds' performance praised for being \\\"compelling\\\" and a \\\"standout\\",
