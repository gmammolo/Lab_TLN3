  "text": "Jackson town councilors unanimously approved plans for the Teton County Justice Center on Tuesday, setting the stage for construction of the massive building to start in February.\nThe roughly 78,000-square-foot center is set to house courts, the sheriff’s office, county jail and other institutions. Teton County officials have said the soon-to-be-built building on the corner of Simpson and King is needed to replace the existing, aging county courthouse there.\n“This is an important building for our community,” Councilor Kevin Regan said. “A courthouse often serves as a focal part in a community and a beacon for justice.”\nDespite backing the Justice Center, some town elected officials were critical of the planning process.\nLast September, after the Justice Center had received the council’s conceptual approval, Teton County commissioners decided to tear down the federal Clifford P. Hansen Courthouse to save costs and ease construction. That decision, and the fallout, left Councilor Jonathan Schechter feeling sour about the project.\n“That struck me as a major change,” Schechter said. “The fact that it happened within a few weeks, and this was after a year and a half of planning, it struck me more as a bait and switch.”\nThe Hansen Courthouse had housed the town’s municipal court, which is charged with handling traffic and parking violations. County officials asked to move the municipal court to the Town Council’s chambers during construction. Town councilors agreed, though county commissioners gave the cold shoulder to their request for $65,000 to cover security upgrades for the chambers.\n“I will vote to support it here, but it just doesn’t feel right,” Schechter said. “Particularly because this created an additional expense for the town.”\nMayor Arne Jorgensen, along with Regan and town staff, believe the removal of the Hansen Courthouse improved the project overall. In the mayor’s eyes, county officials had not pulled a “bait and switch.”\nJorgensen stressed, however, that he expected town and county officials to communicate and cooperate with the town during the 31-month construction of the Justice Center. While he said the town was happy to cover the “very small” amount of money needed to temporarily house the municipal court, Jorgensen said the town’s rejected request was an area for future improvement.\n“We made the request, the commissioners [said] no,” Jorgensen said. “I just think it’s an example where we could do better.”\nBeyond the Hansen courthouse demolition, Schechter was unsettled by the size of the building. When he asked staff how the Justice Center sized up to the new Jacksonian condominium development on Pearl and Cache — located at the previous site of the Ranch Inn — Principal Planner Tyler Valentine said the new court building would be “significantly larger.”\n“To some folks, this building is way too large for its context in the neighborhood,” Valentine said. “Some folks are okay with having a very large statement piece in the town.”\nThe size concerned Schechter, given that the Jacksonian — which he initially supported — was turning out bigger than he had expected based off of architectural renderings.\n“I feel like I got burned once,” Schechter said. “It just came out bigger and much more massive than I anticipated.”\nUltimately, Schechter said the Justice Center was needed, leading him to support it. But the councilor worried that other developers would point to the Justice Center’s size to justify their plans for big buildings.\n“I will not be open to entertain this as a precedent for building other large, massive buildings,” Schechter said.\nThat’s particularly true, he said, for buildings lacking a “clear, civic purpose.”",
