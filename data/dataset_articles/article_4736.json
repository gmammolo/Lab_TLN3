K. Clay and Patrol Officer J. Quidachay received the Fire Chief’s Award for Meritorious Service, and Patrol Officer I. Munoz was also recognized for his role in the July 2025 rescue, police said.\nThe honors were presented during a ceremony held Wednesday night, Jan. 21, 2026.\nThe three officers had previously been recognized by Kent Police in November 2025, when Clay and Quidachay received Life Saving Awards and Munoz received a Letter of Commendation for their response to the house fire, according to the department.\nKent police said the officers acted quickly when seconds mattered to rescue the woman from the burning home.\n“We are thankful for their bravery and decisive actions when seconds counted to save a life,” the Kent Police Department said in a statement. “We are also thankful for the strong collaborative relationship we have with our fellow first responders at Puget Sound Fire.”\n“We are thankful for their bravery and decisive actions when seconds counted to save a life.
