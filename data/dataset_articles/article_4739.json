  "text": "Flagler Sheriff's Office gets helicopter with help from Dan Newlin\nThe Flagler County Sheriff’s Office stated the 2018 Bell 505 was paid for through seized drug money, a budget savings and a contribution from attorney Dan Newlin.\nFrank Fernandez\nThe Flagler County Sheriff’s Office has purchased a $1.42 million helicopter with the help of personal-injury attorney Dan Newlin.\nThe Sheriff’s Office stated the 2018 Bell 505, also known as the Jet Ranger X, was paid for the following ways: $125,000 seized from drug dealers; a “one-time budget savings” of $575,000; and a contribution of $720,000 from Newlin.\nNewlin also donated support equipment valued at $30,000.\n“Public safety is always our top priority. Thanks to Mr. Dan Newlin’s generosity and taking the profits from drug dealers along with a one-time non-recurring budget savings, we were able to obtain a state-of-the-art helicopter for less than half the cost,” Sheriff Rick Staly stated in the release.\nStaly said the chopper “expands our ability to quickly respond to emergencies, especially with medevac for serious accidents.”\nFlagler County bought new helicopter in 2024\nFlagler County has a helicopter, named FireFlight. In August 2024, the county bought an Airbus H125 helicopter at a cost of $5.6 million to replace its old copter. The county originally acquired a helicopter to help spot fires and dump water on them following devastating wildfires in 1998.\nBut Staly stated in the press release that when FireFlight has not been unavailable for transporting medical patients, a helicopter would have to fly in from Jacksonville.\nThe Volusia Sheriff's Office has helicopters, including a $6.8 million Bell 407. It paid for the copter through a variety of ways.\nAnd when the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office has needed a helicopter for law enforcement, it would need to wait for a chopper from as far away as Seminole County, Staly stated.\nStaly said often these outside helicopters were not available.\nDiscussions for increase use of Flagler County helicopter 'not successful'\nThe Sheriff said in the release that he talked to Flagler County Fire Rescue about more availability of FireFlight.\n“I tried to work with FCFR to increase medevac and law enforcement availability with FireFlight, but that discussion was not successful, so I worked for a cost-affordable public-private partnership,” Sheriff Staly added.\nThe Sheriff’s Office helicopter will include a state-of-the-art camera system and powerful spotlight. It will include medevac capabilities and will support deputies during search and rescue missions or tracking suspects. The helicopter will be able to carry deputies, something a drone cannot do, the Sheriff’s Office stated. The chopper will also be able to fly greater distances than a drone.\nNewlin was a former Orange County Sheriff’s deputy before becoming a personal-injury attorney. Newlin is a friend of Staly’s.\n“This donation is about giving back to the community and helping law enforcement do their jobs more effectively,” stated Dan Newlin in the press release. “When I learned about the Sheriff’s Office’s need for a helicopter, I knew it was an opportunity to make a real difference. This aircraft will help save lives, protect families, and keep Flagler County safe for years to come.”\nThe Sheriff's Office will keep its new helicopter at the East Flagler Mosquito Control District facility at Flagler Executive Airport. The district has its own chopper dedicated to fighting mosquitoes.\nThe helicopter will provide more air support for deputies, Staly said in the release. He said he dedicated the helicopter to the late Jane Gentile-Youd. She had advocated for 24-hour medevac capability in Flagler County.\n“It is truly sad that Jane passed before she could see her vision become a reality,” Staly stated. “I want to once again thank Mr. Dan Newlin for his donation and support of the Sheriff’s Office, as this would not have been possible without him.”",
