  "text": "COIMBATORE: Tirupur Corporation Commissioner MP Amith on Thursday lauded two women conservancy workers for their honesty after they found and returned a 3.25 sovereign gold chain discarded in garbage to its rightful owner.\nWhile segregating the garbage collected from a house at EB Colony in ward 24, two contract staff, Karuppal and Ellamma, found the jewel.\nThey immediately handed over the jewel to its owner, Chitra, in the presence of 24 ward councillor R Nagaraj, sanitary inspector Arun Pandian and junior engineer Hakkim.\nFollowing this, Corporation Commissioner MP Amith invited both the conservancy staff to the office and appreciated their benevolent act.",
