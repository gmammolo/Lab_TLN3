  "text": "BUNNELL, Fla. – Flagler County now has a new tool to help authorities respond faster and save lives.\nThe newly-acquired 2018 Bell 505 helicopter, also known as the Jet Ranger X, is valued at $1.42 million. The acquisition was made possible through a combination of seized drug money, year-end budget savings, and a generous donation from Dan Newlin, according to a news release.\n“Public safety is always our top priority,” Sheriff Rick Staly said. “Thanks to Mr. Dan Newlin’s generosity and taking the profits from drug dealers, along with a one-time nonrecurring budget savings, we were able to obtain a state-of-the-art helicopter for less than half the cost.”\nThe partnership included $125,000 from seized drug money and $575,000 from budget savings, totaling $700,000. Newlin donated the remaining $720,000 in market value, plus an additional $30,000 worth of support equipment.\nThe sheriff’s office said the Bell 505 helicopter will enhance its search and rescue, law enforcement air support, and patient transport capabilities. It features a state-of-the-art FLIR camera system, night-sun spotlight, and medevac capabilities.\nUnlike drones, the helicopter can carry personnel and equipment to remote or hard-to-access areas, conduct emergency medical airlifts, and operate over greater distances, extending the sheriff’s office’s operational range and response time, the news release states.\n“This donation is about giving back to the community and helping law enforcement do their jobs more effectively,” Dan Newlin said. “When I learned about the Sheriff’s Office’s need for a helicopter, I knew it was an opportunity to make a real difference. This aircraft will help save lives, protect families, and keep Flagler County safe for years to come.”\nThe sheriff’s office has also partnered with the East Flagler Mosquito Control District, which will house the helicopter at its facility.\nThe helicopter will operate under the sheriff’s Special Operations Section and will complement the existing drone aviation program.\nBefore the acquisition, trauma medevac needs often relied on helicopters from Jacksonville, and law enforcement air support sometimes had to be requested from as far away as Seminole County, causing delays.\n“I tried to work with FCFR to increase medevac and law enforcement availability with FireFlight, but that discussion was not successful, so I worked for a cost-affordable public-private partnership,” Sheriff Staly added. “It’s been a long time coming, and we’re excited to soon give our deputies the additional aerial support they need to protect and serve our community. This helicopter is a game-changer for Flagler County.”\nBreaking News Alerts Get breaking news alerts delivered to your inbox.",
