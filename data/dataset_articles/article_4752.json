  "text": "People in Minnesota have devised a clever strategy to warn others of ICE raids while avoiding them: using their key fobs to remotely trigger car alarms. Minnesota has been one of the states most affected by ICE, and these actions will likely help residents evade confrontations with agents.\nIn a video shared online, it’s possible to see the strategy in action. As masked men walk along a snowy street, apparently searching for someone, a car alarm is heard. Over time, more residents start sounding their alarms, and the agents grow increasingly agitated by what’s happening around them, eventually leaving the scene.\nMost people on social media praised this tactic as an effective way to help others while avoiding ICE: “That is absolutely brilliant. That way they don’t know exactly where you are, and you can hit the button as many times as you want.” Some even commented that the strategy also had the upside of making the agents furious, possibly disrupting their actions.\nInterestingly, one social media user noted that ICE members often seem very confused after hearing loud noises. According to them, ICE agents, unlike other more disciplined law enforcement agencies, often cannot remain focused during stressful situations. They went so far as to speculate that “They’re hiring guys that were rejected from other law enforcement roles because of things like impulse control.”\nOthers, however, focused more on the horror of the scene, noting that the fact that people were whispering in their own home to avoid detection was terrifying. Some even said the atmosphere felt like “hiding in the attic like Anne Frank.”\nICE Continues to Terrorize Minnesota\nThese new strategies may come in handy in the coming days, as the situation with ICE in Minnesota does not seem to be improving anytime soon. Violence and tensions have escalated in the region after the January 7 shooting of Renee Good during an ICE operation, and many locals feel they must fight to protect their safety during raids.\nImmigration agents have recently employed tactics such as taking children to pressure their parents into subjecting themselves to them without fighting back, with multiple incidents happening in the last few weeks, including abducting a five-year-old child. Hopefully, the swift action of the brave people fighting against ICE can be enough to prevent even more incidents such as this one from happening in Minnesota.",
