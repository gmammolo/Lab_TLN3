  "text": "A lady told a London court that Barron Trump saved her life when he saw her ex-boyfriend assault her. After getting a FaceTime call from the US President’s son, he called the police in the UK and said he saw Matvei Rumianstev assaulting the lady, who cannot be identified.\nRumianstev, 22, is said to have been envious of her closeness with Donald Trump’s youngest son. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard a dramatic conversation in which Barron informed 999 operators, “I just got a call from a girl I know.” “She’s getting hit.” The call to the UK police came in at 2:23 a.m. on January 18 of last year.\nHe gives the lady his address and then says again, “It’s really an emergency, please.” She called me and said a man was beating her up. In court, they showed body camera footage from when the police arrived.\nThe policemen asked the lady whether Rumianstev had been streaming throughout the alleged attack. They informed her that someone in the US had contacted them, but they didn’t say who.\nFinally, she said, “I am friends with Barron Trump, who is Donald Trump’s son.” One of the police officers then tells a coworker, “So apparently, this informant from America is likely to be Donald Trump’s son.” This is after she talks about the FaceTime chat from earlier that evening.\nHe goes on to say, “This woman is friends with Donald Trump’s son.” He contacted us when she was on FaceTime with him, and this attack occurred. The policemen then ask the lady if she can phone him back to confirm, and she can be heard saying, “Hello, Barron, did you call the police or anything?”\n“I had someone call the police,” Mr. Trump said in response. He then says to the police, “She called me.” When I took up the phone, I was anticipating a polite “hello” or something.\n“I simply saw a ceiling and heard people yelling. I could see a guy’s head on the phone, and then the camera turned to a woman weeping and being struck.\nMr. Trump stated that it lasted 10 to 15 seconds before the connection terminated. He added, “I called you guys; that was the best thing I could do.” I wasn’t going to call him back and threaten him since it would have made things worse.\nThe lady said that the call to Barron Trump was “a sign from God” during her testimony. She told the jury that “he would call me” and that she had missed “a few” calls from him before the call that ultimately connected and led him to phone the police.\nWhen Rumiantsev’s lawyer, Sasha Wass KC, questioned her, she said that the call from Barron Trump “saved your life.” She said, “He helped save my life.” At that time, the call seemed like a message from God.\nThe lady told the jury that she was “on my knees begging,” but the call let her get back up. Jurors have heard that the victim and Rumiantsev had been dating for around six months when the assaults are said to have happened.\nShe says that after they fought, he attacked her, even strangling her. Months later, she told the police again that Rumiantsev had sexually molested her. She informed them that he had raped her twice, first in November 2024 and again just hours before the police got to his flat on January 18.\nRumiantsev is also accused of attempting to get the victim to drop her allegations by putting pressure on her. Ms. Wass said that Rumiantsev had held the lady back after she had been “angry and violently” towards him that night. She told her that her story was “a complete fabrication.”\nThe lawyer asked her about the sexual assault charges and said, “You made up this completely false and made-up story that he raped you on those two occasions. You were never raped.” The lady said, “I didn’t make that up.” That would be really bad and nasty to anyone who has been in that circumstance.\nThe Russian man from New Providence Wharf in east London says he didn’t attack, ABH, rape twice, intentionally strangle someone, or change the course of justice.\nREAD NEXT",
