  "text": "Times photo/Tim Thomas\n40 hours of training\nHardin County Sheriff’s Deputies Michah Davis (left) and Timothy Moe (right) display certificates showing they successfully completed 40 hours of training with the Allen, Auglaize and Hardin Counties Crisis Intervention Team, coordinated by Daniel Harmon with the Mental Health Recovery Services Board. Two deputies with the Hardin County Sheriff’s Office recently completed 40 hours of crisis intervention training with the Allen, Auglaize and Hardin Counties Crisis Intervention Team.\nDeputies Michah Davis and Timothy Moe were among first responders in Auglaize, Allen and Hardin counties to receive training by the Mental Health Recovery Services Board through Prevention Awareness Support Services in Lima\nCrisis Intervention Team Coordinator Daniel Harmon said first responders are given training in multiple areas of mental health. They are given an overview of mental health and substance use disorders and how it affects the anatomy and physiology of the brain and body. First responders are given instruction on de-escalation and tactical techniques for someone experiencing a mental health crisis, and they apply those skills during scenario-based training with trained actors.\nThe students are introduced to panels of people living in recovery, family members, and veterans. He said the panels give the students a different perspective of what it is like to live with a mental health and/or substance use struggle and are very interactive.\nHarmon said the students attend drug and mental health courts in the Allen County Common Pleas Division. The course covers local resources and tours of facilities in the area. First responders are also taught about resiliency for themselves and how to care for their own mental health well-being.\nCrisis Intervention Team was developed in Memphis, Tenn., by the Memphis Police Department and local partnerships in response to an officer involved shooting of a person suffering from a mental health crisis who was armed with an edged weapon.\nHe said it came to Ohio in 2000 and expanded to all 88 counties. The purpose of the Crisis Intervention Team program is to train first responders, educate the community, and build relationships in the community to have safer outcomes involving people in a mental health crisis.\n“The attendance of Deputies Davis and Moe show the continued commitment of Sheriff (Keith) Everhart to keep the community of Hardin County safe through empathy, education, respect, and dignity,” Harmon said.",
