  "text": "The U.S. murder rate in 2025 plunged to its lowest level in over a century, according to a report released Thursday.\nThe average reported homicide rate declined 21% in 35 major U.S. cities in 2025, marking the largest one-year drop of all time and likely the lowest level since 1900, according to data compiled by the Council on Criminal Justice (CCJ). Meanwhile, 11 of 13 tracked offenses were lower in 2025 compared to in 2024, while nine of the offenses declined by 10% or more, according to the report.\nThe newly released report found that there were 9% fewer aggravated assaults, 22% fewer gun assaults and 2% fewer domestic violence incidents reported in 2025 compared to in 2024. Meanwhile, total robberies declined by 23% last year, while carjackings dropped by 43%, according to the report.\nDrug-related crimes were up 7% in 2025, marking the sole category which increased, the CCJ’s report found.\n“President Trump campaigned on Making America Safe Again and he is delivering,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Thursday in a statement provided to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Whether it be deporting criminal illegal aliens, supporting law enforcement officers, or finally being tough on criminals, the Trump Administration has employed a whole-of-government approach to drive down crime and make communities safer.”\nAmong the 35 total U.S. cities that reported homicide data, 31 experienced decreases, according to the data compiled by CCJ. Denver saw a 41% drop in murders, while Washington, D.C., and Omaha, Nebraska, each recorded 40% declines, the report shows.\nLittle Rock, Arkansas, experienced the largest increase in homicides last year at 16%, according to the report.\n“This is what happens when you have a President who fully mobilizes federal law enforcement to arrest violent criminals and the worst of the worst illegal aliens,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in an X post on Thursday in response to the newly released crime data.\nIn July 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to eliminate crime and disorderly conduct across the nation. Trump also issued a separate executive order in August 2025 declaring a crime emergency in Washington, D.C. in an effort to “protect public servants, citizens, and tourists” and “ensure the safe functioning” of federal government agencies.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said in a Sept. 9, 2025 press release that Trump’s crime crackdown had resulted in “immediate results in the nation’s capital.”\nRepublican Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn wrote in a Sept. 18, 2025 X post that “fighting crime in our cities should be a bipartisan issue,” adding that it is “a shame Democrats refuse to give @realDonaldTrump the credit he deserves for his decisive leadership.”\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.
