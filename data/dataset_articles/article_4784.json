  "text": "Enhanced security measures and new chips¬†have led to an 84%¬†reduction in¬†electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card¬†thefts effecting¬†San Diego County‚Äôs CalFresh, CalWORKs¬†and General Relief recipients.¬†\nNearly a year ago,¬†the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) issued new EBT cards with chips similar to those in many credit cards. The card expiration date, card security code and all personal information also were moved to the back side of the card.¬†\nOther safety measures¬†include a new app, called¬†ebtEDGE, allowing recipients to securely manage their accounts. It is now easier for recipients believed to have had their EBT card compromised to reset their PIN number.¬†\n“This drastic decline in theft shows what we can do when we work together across jurisdictions,‚Äù Alberto Banuelos, PhD, interim director, Self Sufficiency Services said.¬†‚ÄúEvery recipient deserves peace of mind knowing their benefits are safe, which is¬†a¬†goal¬†we‚Äôve been diligently working¬†on¬†to¬†protect our most vulnerable neighbors for decades.‚Äù¬†\nThe measures build off San Diego County‚Äôs previous efforts to combat theft. In March 2025, the County piloted forced PIN resets for compromised cardholders, reducing theft by 80% amongst 30,000 compromised cardholders. The best practice was widely adopted across the state, significantly reducing card theft.¬†\nAbout¬†405,000 County residents are eligible to use¬†EBT¬†cards.¬†CalFresh‚ÄØcustomers use their EBT card to buy fresh produce and nutritious food at a‚ÄØvariety of stores across the state.‚ÄØCalWORKs‚ÄØand‚ÄØGeneral Relief‚ÄØcustomers use¬†cash aid to help them become more self-sufficient, whether that is paying for food, housing,¬†clothes¬†or other¬†basic necessities.‚ÄØ¬†\nWhile the new cards are more secure, recipients can take steps to protect their benefits.¬†\n- Change your PIN¬†regularly.¬†Avoid¬†using easily guessed numbers like birthdays or repeated digits.¬†\n- Monitor your¬†account.¬†Use¬†the¬†ebtEDGE¬†app or website to check transactions¬†frequently.¬†\n- Report suspicious activity¬†immediately.¬†If¬†you think your card or PIN has been compromised, call the EBT Customer Service number on the back of your card.¬†\n- Never share your PIN.¬†Treat it like a password¬†and¬†keep¬†it private.¬†\nNeither the State of California¬†or¬†the County of San Diego will¬†ever¬†call¬†or text asking for your card or PIN number.¬†\nSan Diego County¬†remains¬†committed to protecting residents‚Äô benefits and ensuring that¬†assistance¬†reaches those who need it most.
