  "text": "Mum of teenage victim \"relieved\" as man jailed for knife attack\nThe boy was stabbed in broad daylight in Waltham Abbey\nLast updated 10 minutes ago\nThe mother of teenage boy who was stabbed in broad daylight in Waltham Abbey has said she is \"relieved\" his attacker is now behind bars.\nThe boy was attacked as he was walking with his friends near a parade of shops in Hillhouse on 11 June last year.\nCollins Mufuta repeatedly punched him, and eventually stabbed the boy in the leg before fleeing.\nThankfully the injury to his thigh was not life-threatening.\nThe 22-year-old, of no fixed address, was arrested the following month and later charged.\nIn December, he pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of a knife blade/sharp pointed article in a public place.\nOn Monday (19 January) Mufuta was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison.\nIn a statement, the victim's mother said: “I could have so easily lost my son that day. That horrific thought goes through my head and it’s why I want to tell people to stop carrying knives.\n“Is it really worth risking someone’s life?”\n“It’s such a relief that he is now behind bars. If I’m honest I didn’t think he would be caught, but I’m so grateful to the detectives from Essex Police for their dedication, support and determination which ensured we got justice and can start to move forward with our lives.”\nDetective Constable Leonardo Pilato, who led the investigation, said: “This was an unprovoked knife attack on a teenage boy in broad daylight on a busy shopping parade in Waltham Abbey.\n“The victim has suffered significant trauma as a result of this incident. Beyond the physical injuries, the emotional impact on him and his family will be long lasting.\n“The team worked diligently to identify Mufuta and built a strong evidential case to put before the court.\n“We know Incidents of this nature create fear within the wider community and threaten the sense of safety that every person is entitled to.\n“Essex Police is committed to tackling knife crime and protecting our communities. Those who choose to carry or use knives should expect firm and decisive action.\n“Knife crime destroys lives, and strong court sentences play an essential role in safeguarding the public and making clear that violence of this kind will not be tolerated.”\nThe victim’s mum added: “That incident affects my son every day. He doesn’t like to talk about what happened, but while the physical scars are healing, the psychological scars are far more difficult to treat.\n“He doesn’t like to go out and has lost his confidence. He does attend college, but doesn’t feel safe making his own way there.\n“So he is facing his own prison sentence.\n“He didn’t even want to tell the police when it first happened, that’s how scared he was. But he did and now his attacker is behind bars, and we can work on moving forward.”",
