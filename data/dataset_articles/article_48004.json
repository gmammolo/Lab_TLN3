  "text": "Striking workers continue to picket, cause bus delays and 'unnecessary chaos,' regional chair says\nKate Bueckert | CBC News | Posted: March 28, 2025 1:30 PM | Last Updated: 1 hour ago\n'It shows a clear disregard for the residents who depend on these services,' Chair Karen Redman said\nPeople were left waiting at bus stops around Waterloo region Friday morning as striking outside regional workers picketed in front of Grand River Transit facilities in Waterloo and Cambridge.\nIt was a move regional Chair Karen Redman said was causing \"unnecessary chaos,\" and comes as the region and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) local 1656\nreached a tentative agreement on Thursday.Grand River Transit posted on X, formerly Twitter, that workers were picketing at the Cambridge operations centre as well as the maintenance facility on Northfield Drive.\n\"There are ongoing delays to bus service. We are working on resuming scheduled service as soon as possible,\" Grand River Transit said in the posts.\n\"We understand that this situation is frustrating, but please be patient with our operators, who are doing their best to get service back on schedule.\"\nIn a statement Friday morning, Redman said she was \"deeply disappointed\" to hear about the pickets.\n\"Despite a tentative agreement, their picketing caused unnecessary chaos — cancelling and delaying bus trips that residents rely on. Workers were left stranded, students struggled to get to class, and some may have even missed critical medical appointments,\" Redman wrote.\n\"This deliberate disruption undermines respectful negotiations. More than that, it shows a clear disregard for the residents who depend on these services and the dedicated regional staff working to provide them.\"\nCBC News reached out to CUPE for comment on the Friday pickets but did not immediately hear back.\nCUPE local 1656 represents people who work in departments including the airport, bus maintenance, landfill, roads and water. Workers walked off the job on March 3.\nIn a release on Thursday, the region outlined the offer to workers, which included:\n- A salary increase of almost 12 per cent to all positions over a three-year period.\n- A $1 per hour wage adjustment and 3.5 per cent increase in the first year.\n- A commitment to do a market review for skilled trades classifications.\n- A promise to look at other \"enhancements\" banked overtime, meal allowance and stand-by rates.\nCUPE members need to vote on the deal before it is ratified at a special council meeting.\nRedman said she wanted union leadership to \"reflect on the real impact of their actions and consider the harm they have caused to the community\" by holding pickets Friday morning.",
