  "text": "Earlier, officials from Karnataka’s Labour Department visited Infosys’ campuses in Bengaluru and Mysuru to assess the situation after reports of trainee layoffs Source : Glassdoor Software giant Infosys has reportedly terminated 30-45 trainees from its Mysuru campus on March 26 after they failed to pass internal assessments, according to a Moneycontrol report citing sources. However, the Bengaluru-based company is providing an alternative career path for the affected trainees, offering 12 weeks of training for potential roles in Infosys Business Process Management (BPM), it added.\nThis move comes two months after Infosys let go of approximately 350 trainees from the same campus, who had been onboarded after a delay of over 2.5 years. Additionally, Infosys announced it would sponsor the training for those who choose to pursue the BPM course.\n“Further to the announcement of the results of your final assessment attempt, please be informed that you have not met the qualifying criteria in the 'Foundation skills training program' despite the additional preparation time, doubt-clearing sessions, and several mock assessments opportunities,” mails sent to trainees read, as per the report.\nOne-Month Ex-gratia Payment\nIn addition, India’s second-largest IT services company is offering affected trainees a one-month ex-gratia payment along with a relieving letter.\nFor those unwilling to pursue the BPM pathway, Infosys will arrange transport from Mysuru to Bangalore and provide a standard travel allowance to their hometown. If needed, trainees can stay at the Employee Care Centre in Mysuru until their departure date.\nTrainees wishing to leave the campus have been asked to submit their travel and accommodation preferences by March 27, 2025.\nAlso Read: Llyods Recruiting Engineers In India After Slashing Jobs In UK. See Which Roles It Is Hiring For\nClean Chit\nOn February 27, the Karnataka Labour Department cleared Infosys of any labour law violations concerning the termination of trainees, based on documentary evidence.\n“They were all only trainees, and some underwent training for three months. We cannot call it a layoff, so these labour laws are not applicable in such cases. A layoff applies only when there is regular employment. There is no employer-employee relationship at all. They were all apprenticeship trainees, not employees,” a source stated in the report.\nEarlier, officials from Karnataka’s Labour Department visited Infosys’ campuses in Bengaluru and Mysuru to assess the situation after reports of trainee layoffs. This followed a directive from the Union Labour Ministry, instructing the Karnataka Labour Commissioner and Labour Secretary to investigate the matter and take necessary actions to resolve the issue.\nInfosys has consistently maintained that the company has adhered to its existing policy, which states that freshers who fail the assessment will not be able to continue with the organisation.",
