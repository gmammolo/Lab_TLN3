  "text": "Employee allegedly laid off for refusing to work overtime: ‘Saw her leaving in tears’\nA long-time employee was allegedly laid off due to her refusal to work overtime.\nAn employee at a reputed multinational company (MNC) in the product-based sector was abruptly asked to resign after 3.5 years, reportedly due to budget constraints, leaving colleagues stunned. However, some believe the real reason was her refusal to work overtime. A coworker took to social media to recall, “I saw her leaving the office in tears,” questioning why only one person was let go if budget cuts were genuinely the reason.\nTaking to Reddit, another employee shared his concerns about the incident, describing how the company was known for its great and flexible culture, with many employees staying for decades. However, this sudden layoff made them reconsider their perception. The departing employee was known for speaking her mind and refusing to overwork, unlike others who silently accepted additional responsibilities. This has led to speculation that her dismissal may have been influenced by her straightforward approach rather than financial reasons.\nAlso read: Infosys, Wipro, TCS among tech giants blacklisted in US recruiter's leaked email: 'Not the right fit'\n“What I found strange is that if budget cuts were really the issue, there should have been more layoffs, not just one person,” wrote the user.\nTake a look at the post:\nFollowing the post, many Reddit users weighed in, with some advising employees to navigate workplace politics carefully. One user wrote, “Sadly, you must play politics in corporate. Don’t just blatantly refuse work. She should have refused in a diplomatic way.” Others echoed similar views, emphasising the importance of strategic communication in corporate settings.\nAnother user added, “Dont trust a picture just by one perspective. Anyone who is laid off always has a story where the company/boss was the villain and they were not. Secondly, they are all colleagues, and if you are scared, so are your bosses and management. Do your due diligence, make yourself important to the company and though you still might be laid off, at least your chances will be lesser.”\nHT.com has not independently verified these claims.\nAlso read: ‘Dhoom Machale’ plays at Westminster Abbey for King Charles, desi viewers in disbelief\nTrending NewsViral News, Video, Photos and\nWeather Updatesof India and around the world\nTrending NewsViral News, Video, Photos and\nWeather Updatesof India and around the world",
