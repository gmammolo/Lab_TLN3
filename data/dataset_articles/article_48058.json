  "text": "Block is laying off nearly 1,000 employees.\nBlock / Terence Bordon Block, the Jack Dorsey-led financial tech company, is laying off 931 workers, according to a memo reported by Techcrunch.\nThe layoffs will affect 240 remote workers in California, according to a state filing viewed by the Chronicle. Affected workers include business analysts, data engineers, designers, lawyers and software engineers.\nBlock shed its San Francisco headquarters designation but has its biggest office in Oakland. It is cutting 391 workers for “strategy” reasons and 460 for “performance,” according to the memo by Dorsey. Another 80 managers are being laid off, while 193 managers are becoming individual contributors.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nAnother 748 job listings are being scrapped.\nDorsey denied that the layoffs were due to financial reasons or artificial intelligence, instead citing “our needs around strategy, raising the bar and acting faster on performance, and flattening our org.“\nBlock did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its products include Cash App, Square and Tidal. The company also laid off around 1,000 workers in January 2024.\nBlock’s stock is down almost 32% this year and fell another 3.7% on Wednesday. The company’s fourth quarter earnings missed analyst expectations.\nIn other local tech layoffs, Niantic said it was laying off 68 workers in San Francisco after agreeing to a $3.5 billion sale of its games division to Scopely. The deal requires regulatory approval.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nAppLovin Corp. also said it was laying off 97 workers in Palo Alto, according to a state filing.\nReach Roland Li: roland.li@sfchronicle.com; X: @rolandlisf",
