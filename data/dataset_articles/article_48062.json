  "text": "More than 1,000 mechanics and workers from bicycle and car companies across the Netherlands will walk out for 48 hours starting today, March 27, over a growing dispute with low wage increases. As reported by NL Times , the national strike is being led by trade union FNV . The industry organisation BOVAG has failed to return with an improved collective labour agreement (CLA) offer.\nMechanic strikes hitting most provinces in the Netherlands FNV board member Murat Sekercan confirmed that workers across all Dutch provinces – except Groningen and Friesland – will join the strike on Thursday and Friday March 27 and 28). Those two regions are reportedly staging their own 48-hour strikes next week.\nMost Read on Euro Weekly News Sekercan warned that hundreds of auto and bicycle businesses, particularly branches of larger firms, will either shut down entirely or be partially closed during the action. “This will lead to people having to wait longer for maintenance on their cars,” he said, cited by NL Times .\nWhy are mechanics striking in the Netherlands? The dispute is over a proposed new CLA covering more than 84,500 employees. FNV is demanding a 7 per cent wage increase over one year, the scrapping of youth wages, and improvements to working conditions. This includes making the heavy work regulation permanent, allowing earlier retirement for physically demanding roles, a fully reimbursed commuting allowance, and 100 per cent compensation for care and parental leave.\nSo far, BOVAG has offered only a 2.3 per cent raise, which FNV has dismissed as inadequate. The employer organisation also proposed a wage increase of “over 3 per cent” across 18 months – an offer it believes would account for inflation. However, BOVAG spokespersons say that FNV’s demands are “not achievable.”\nA BOVAG spokesperson told NL Times , “We feel this was not necessary and will cause significant nuisance for companies, customers, and employees who do not go on strike.”\nSupport from other unions in the Netherlands for mechanic strikes FNV isn’t alone in this battle. Other unions, including CNV and De Unie, are also supporting the strikes. CNV is demanding a 6 per cent wage increase, citing rising living costs.\nView all news from the Netherlands .\nTags: , Share this story\nSign up for personalised news Subscribe to our Euro Weekly News alerts to get the latest stories into your inbox!\nDaily Weekly By signing up, you will create a Euro Weekly News account if you don't already have one.
