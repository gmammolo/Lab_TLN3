  "text": "ZIMMERMAN, Minn. (KFGO) – A man is in custody in the Sherburne County Jail for the alleged kidnapping of a seven-year-old girl in Zimmerman that prompted an Amber Alert.\nThe Sherburne County Sheriff’s Office said the girl was last seen getting off the school bus around 4:00 p.m. Wednesday and then disappeared.\nSherburne County Dispatch received a call reporting the girl missing at about 6:30 p.m.\nA community notification was issued at 9:45 p.m. describing a black car following the school bus. Investigators eventually ruled out any involvement of a black vehicle.\nAn Amber Alert was issued at 11:40 p.m. after law enforcement received information that she likely had been abducted.\nThrough investigation and use of technology, investigators identified a white Dodge Ram pickup as a suspect vehicle and issued an emergency alert to law enforcement agencies just after 12:30 a.m.\nAround 1:00 Thursday morning, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) reported the girl was found safe in a vehicle on Interstate-35.\n28-year-old Joseph Bragg of Maple Grove was arrested. The Sherburne County Sheriff’s Office says he will be charged with child abduction.\nThe girl was checked out at a hospital and reunited with her family.",
