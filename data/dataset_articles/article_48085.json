  "text": "'Slowdown Fears & AI Shift Hit Hiring, But...': IIM Sambalpur Director On Drop In Placements\nIIM Sambalpur has recently integrated AI into classroom learning.\nWith management education evolving rapidly, IIM Sambalpur is at the forefront of innovation—bringing AI into classrooms, reshaping student engagement, and preparing future leaders for a tech-driven world. But how does this transformation impact learning outcomes? In an exclusive conversation with News18.com, IIM Sambalpur Director Prof. Mahadeo Jaiswal shares insights on the institute’s AI-powered classrooms. He also shared the institute’s placement roadmap amid a shifting job market and the steps being taken to position IIM Sambalpur among the country’s top business schools.\nQ. IIM Sambalpur has recently integrated AI into classroom learning. How has this transformation impacted student engagement and discussions, and what measurable improvements have you observed in learning outcomes?\nrelated stories\nMahadeo Jaiswal: The incorporation of AI in classroom learning at IIM Sambalpur has majorly transformed student engagement and participation in the academics. The AI-driven learning model allows students to come prepared for discussions and strengthens both individual and group interactions, this also ensures that students are prepared in advance for deeper discussions in the classroom by providing pre-class material such as case studies, articles, and videos. The conduct of real-time quizzes and evaluations by AI ensures that every student remains engaged and accountable in the class discussions. It is making the learning process more interactive and dynamic for every individual.\nThis shift from traditional classes to AI-driven classes has led to higher-quality participation and a more structured learning environment for the students. Also, instant feedback shows a noticeable improvement in student’s preparation, with more precise and objective assessment of their contribution during class discussions. This has led to more accurate and meaningful outcomes, mainly in terms of analysis and application. It is shift from traditional teacher centric teaching to student centric learning.\nQ. While student feedback on AI-based learning has been largely positive, the institute report highlights some challenges, such as technical difficulties. What measures are being taken to enhance the AI-driven learning experience and ensure its seamless adoption across courses?\nMahadeo Jaiswal: Though the feedback from the students regarding the AI-driven learning model has been enthusiastically positive, we also acknowledge that there have been initial technical challenges, mainly in terms of system integration and content structuring. To ensure a smooth adoption of AI across all courses, we are investing in strong technical infrastructure and continuous training sessions for both faculty members and students.\nOur faculty members have been trained to adapt the new AI system to suit specific course needs. We are also gradually incorporating AI into the curriculum, starting with a few sessions in each course. Also, our dedicated technical support team is keenly monitoring the system promptly to resolve any glitches. Because of the economics of scale, we anticipate that the cost per session will decrease as the system develops, which will help a seamless learning experience for the students.\nQ. IIM Sambalpur was ranked 50th among management institutions in India by the NIRF 2024. What strategic initiatives are you implementing to enhance the institute’s ranking and position it among the top IIMs?\nMahadeo Jaiswal: We at IIM Sambalpur believe in strengthening our national and international stature through a multi-dimensional, strategic approach. While NIRF rankings place more importance on publication in research, overall our interest is to secure elite global accreditations like AACSB, as in line with our vision of providing world-class education.\nOne of the foundations of our strategy is how we incorporated Artificial Intelligence (AI) into teaching methodologies. Not only does this technology equip our students with relevant skills for the future, making them more employable and placement-ready, but it also gives our teachers more time to carry out high-impact research. By promoting a culture of scholarship, we also aspire to greatly improve our research productivity and international academic collaborations.\nWe are also placing high emphasis on faculty development, infrastructure upgradation, and innovative programs such as AI-based learning models to make us stand apart from other IIMs. Moreover, our focus on quality placements ensures a robust industry connection, which is as valuable for recruiters as for students. In the long run, we aim to not only enhance rankings but also position IIM Sambalpur as a world-class institution of excellence in learning, research, and innovation.\nQ. Could you highlight some of the flagship courses offered by IIM Sambalpur and the admission process for these programs?\nMahadeo Jaiswal: At IIM Sambalpur, we offer a diverse range of flagship courses, which include the “MBA\" with specialized electives in fields such as Marketing, Finance, Operations and Strategy. Also, we have recently launched a new flagship programme, that is “MBA in Business Analytics\". These courses are designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of management concepts and parallelly practical skills to excel in today’s dynamic business environment.\nOur admission process follows a rigorous multi-stage selection procedure, including CAT (Common Admission Test) scores, GD (Group Discussion), PI (Personal Interview Rounds). Candidates with appropriate job experience, high academic credentials, and proven leadership potential are given preference. Also, we strongly value diversity and encourage applications from students with excellent professional and academic backgrounds.\nQ. In 2023, IIM Sambalpur’s highest package was Rs 64.61 LPA at Microsoft, whereas in 2024, it dropped to Rs 23.50 LPA. What factors contributed to this decline, and what steps are being taken to enhance placement opportunities in the coming years?\nMahadeo Jaiswal: The decline in the highest placement package in 2024 shows the wider global economic SLOWDOWN, not just in IIMs or IITs but the whole world, with various reasons including the recessions in major economies and the development of AI technologies affecting the recruiting environment in the job market. Although this is a temporary setback, we are committed to expanding our placement opportunities across different industries, including technology, finance, consulting, and entrepreneurship.\nQ. What makes an MBA application successful? please share some tips for aspirants.\nMahadeo Jaiswal: A successful MBA application includes academic performance, professional experiences, and personal qualities. It is important for candidates to show that they have a clear and precise understanding of their career goals and how an MBA degree will help them achieve those professional objectives. Additionally, strong leadership quality is highly valued, whether by showcasing in extracurricular activities or in professional accomplishments. Also, candidates should be able to effectively convey their ideas and should also have a strong understanding of the current industry trends.\nThey should also have a good command over their communication skills. We advise candidates to concentrate on creating a versatile profile that showcases their goals and strong points, in addition to being genuine in their personal statements and interviews. With that, preparing thoroughly for CAT and demonstrating consistent academic performance will create a competitive application.\n- Location :\n- First Published:\nNews\neducation-career'Slowdown Fears & AI Shift Hit Hiring, But...': IIM Sambalpur Director On Drop In Placements",
