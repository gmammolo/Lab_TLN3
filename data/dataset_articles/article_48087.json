  "text": "Crystal Dynamics lays off 17 employees\n\"This step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success\"\nCrystal Dynamics has announced its decision to lay off 17 employees to \"better align with [its] current business needs\".\nIn a statement shared on social media, the developer clarified that this decision would not affect its \"current project plans\", which include the Perfect Dark reboot (co-developed with The Initiative) and an untitled Tomb Raider game.\n\"We did not make this decision lightly,\" the statement read. \"Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected.\n\"We recognise how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach.\n\"Crystal Dynamics remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games. This change does not alter our current project plans.\"\nStaff at Crystal Dynamics last faced a round of redundancies in September 2023, when ten people were let go.\nThis came after a major restructuring program at the developer's parent company Embracer, which faced the collapse of a deal believed to be worth $2 billion. The firm also faced more than $1 billion in debt.\nCrystal Dynamics was acquired by Embracer in 2022.",
