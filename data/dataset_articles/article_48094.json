  "text": "Infosys Termination: Massive Firing From Mysuru Campus\nInfosys reportedly terminated 30-45 trainees from its Myrusu campus on March 26 after they failed to pass internal assessments.\nInfosys Termination: Massive Firing From Mysuru Campus\nSoftware giant Infosys reportedly let go of 30 to 45 trainees from its Mysuru campus on March 26 after they did not pass their internal assessments, according to various reports. This decision comes just two months after the company dismissed around 350 trainers from the same location.\nHowever, this time, to assist the affected trainees, Infosys is offering an alternative career path, including 12 weeks of training for potential roles in Infosys Business Process Management (BPM).\nFor those who decide not to pursue opportunities with Infosys, the company will arrange transportation from Mysuru to Bangalore, along with a standard travel allowance to return to their hometowns. Trainees can also stay at the Employee Care Centre in Mysuru until their departure.\nOfficials explained that since these individuals were not full-time employees but apprenticeship trainees, their termination does not fall under layoff regulations as per labor laws.\n\"They were all only trainees, and some underwent training for three months. We cannot call it a layoff, so these labor laws are not applicable in such cases. There is no employer-employee relationship at all,\" a department source said.\nDespite facing criticism, the company has stood firm on its policy, which states that freshers who do not pass the internal assessments cannot continue with the organization.",
