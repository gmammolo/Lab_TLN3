  "text": "Students at the University of Kent have seen their lectures getting cancelled as staff members have planned to go on strike this week over the threat of future redundancies. The University of Kent, which has campuses in Canterbury and Medway, has been involved in financial problems for years.\nThe institution issued \"at risk of redundancy\" notices to 58 staff, while 40 others had taken voluntary redundancy, it was revealed in February last year. Moreover, the institution abolished courses – axing programmes in anthropology, art history, health and social care, journalism, music and audio technology, and philosophy.\nThe decision provoked protests at the university's Canterbury campus. And, as a result, Karen Cox, who had led the university as vice-chancellor since 2017, resigned.\nThe university ran a voluntary redudancy scheme and leaving roles unfilled in a desperate bid to save £19.5 million, at the start of this year. Nevertheless, the institution's staff who are members of the University and College Union (UCU) voted in favour of going on strike throughout this week.\nUCU revealed in a statement: \"The university has found itself in a regular cycle of cuts to staff, courses and restructures, all of which impact the livelihoods and workloads of staff who work tirelessly to support students, conduct outstanding research and scholarship, and keep the university going. Staff are taking action after the employer refused to rule out compulsory redundancies or provide guarantees that staff will not suffer detriment to their workload or working conditions.\n\"In negotiations this year, management extended a promise of no compulsory redundancies to academic teaching staff until December 2025. However, they could not guarantee the same for professional services staff (such as student support, marketing, and library services), some of whom are also UCU members.\"\nOn Monday, the Parliament of Kent Students' Union (KSU) reportedly voted \"overwhelmingly\" to support the strikes according to KSU president Lulu Collins. She noted: \"There are many opinions among students though.\"\nLulu continued: \"A lot of students aren't fully au fait with why UCU are striking – there's no real communication between the UCU and students.\" Many of the staff striking will also be postgraduate students who work as teaching assistants – who are also members of KSU.\nThe KSU president further revealed: \"The changes that the UCU are struggling with – the restructuring, etc – students just don't feel in the know about it.\" Lulu also stated that as with some previous strikes, it is possible the university will run a scheme to compensate students for lost teaching time during the industrial action, but this is not guaranteed.\nIt has been reported that any savings the university makes due to the strikes cannot be kept by the institution itself. This means that that the money will be used for individual financial compensation for students. It can also go to hardship funds or a mix of both the financial compensation and the funds, depending on the impact of the strikes.\nLulu said: \"About 70% of universities are facing financial deficits this year, a lot of the sector is really unstable, and that means that conflicts like this I think are more likely to occur. At the end of the day, the uni has so many resources and UCU has a strong mandate so it can only move forward by talking to find a solution that's sustainable.\n\"For our students' and staff's sake I hope that happens soon.\" The University of Kent has almost 19,000 students and more than 4,500 staff – of which 1,200 are academic staff, the institution reveals.\nA spokesperson for the university shared: \"Despite constructive negotiations last week, some staff who are University and College Union members are taking five days of strike action from today. Under our Redundancy Avoidance Agreement with the Union, when we need to make staff savings, we ensure we explore all options to avoid the need for compulsory redundancies which are only ever a last resort.\n\"As we continue to work through these options with UCU, we are disappointed to see strike action and are open to continued talks to try and resolve their concerns. In the meantime we have plans in place to ensure any impact on our students is minimised as far as possible.\"\nGet more news from KentLive straight to your inbox for free HERE.",
