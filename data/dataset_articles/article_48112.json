  "text": "Thousands of jobs under threat in British Steel closure plans\nThousands of jobs are at risk after a steelmaker unveiled closure proposals.\nBritish Steel has launched a consultation on the future of its Scunthorpe blast furnaces and steelmaking operations.\nBosses say the ventures are “no longer financially sustainable due to highly challenging market conditions, the imposition of tariffs and higher environmental costs”.\nOperations – which include a rod mill – could close by as early as June 2025, affecting as many as 2500 jobs.\nThe consultation follows the breakdown of talks between British Steel owner Jingye and the Government over investment support for new electric arc furnaces, and comes amid reports the firm has rejected a £500 million Westminster rescue package.\nUnion Unite has branded the company’s plans a “disgrace”, accusing British Steel of “trying to hold the Government to ransom”.\nZengwei An, British Steel chief executive, said the “difficult” decision comes as the firm battles with “significant” losses of around £700,000 a day.\nHe added: “We understand this is an extremely difficult day for our staff, their families and everyone associated with British Steel.\n“But we believe this is a necessary decision given the hugely challenging circumstances the business faces.\n“We remain committed to engaging with our workforce and unions, as well as our suppliers and customers during this time.”\nResponding to the company’s announcement, Sharon Graham, general secretary at union Unite, ordered the company to revive discussions with the Government.\nShe added: “The Government has clearly made an offer to invest heavily in British Steel.\n“This offer comes with long-term job guarantees - anything less would be a complete misuse of taxpayers’ money.\n“British Steel must now withdraw its job threats and work with the Government and Unite on a sustainable way forward.\n“The UK has the opportunity of becoming a leader in green steel and British Steel should be at the forefront of that transformation.”\nLooking to promote your product/service to SME businesses in your region?\nFind out how Bdaily can help →\nEnjoy the read?
