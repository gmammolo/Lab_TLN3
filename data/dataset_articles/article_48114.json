  "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif. (KGO) -- A Santa Clara County Superior Court judge on Wednesday ruled with the VTA and issued an injunction to end the union workers strike and bring back bus and light rail services.\nVTA argued the work stoppage violated a \"no strike\" clause in its last contract.\nThe ATU Local 265 said the contract expired.\nVTA says employees need to return to work \"immediately,\" but they are not sure how soon service will resume.\nThe president of ATU Local 265 says he's not sure if the injunction will get union members to return to work.\nThis is a breaking news update. Previous story follows.\nThe weeks-long VTA strike is heading to court Wednesday where a judge will decide the fate of the transit agency and its striking workers.\nWe spoke with principal attorney Adam Juratovac on what the judge will decide.\n\"Is whether the judge is going to allow the ATU to continue their strike, or if the judge is going to rule in favor the VTA and the collective bargaining agreement and stop the strike where it is,\" Juratovac said.\nVTA says their contract with the union is very clear. \"ATU agreed to a 'no strike' clause.\"\nRELATED: VTA strike continues for 3rd week after union votes down latest proposal\nIn their complaint, their no-strike language stated:\n\"The term of this Agreement shall begin on March 7, 2022, and continues through March 3, 2025, and from year to year thereafter.\"\nBut the union argues that's contradictory.\nThey say a memo and statements were made in the media by the VTA that their contract had expired.\nPolitical science professor Robert Ovetz teaches labor relations at San Jose State University.\nMORE: VTA workers injured in traffic incident on 1st day of strike that shut down bus, light rail service\n\"We don't really have a lot of recent history where courts have stepped in and stopped a strike. In my perspective on this, is that it would be best for both parties to get back to the bargaining table and come to an agreement,\" Ovetz said.\nSo how did we get here?\nOn March 10, the union representing bus drivers, and other workers went on strike halting bus and light rail services across Silicon Valley.\nOn March 11, the VTA filed a legal complaint to Santa Clara County Superior Court.\nMORE: Unhoused South Bay commuters impacted tremendously from ongoing VTA strike\n\"They filed an emergency motion saying you guys - the court - please stop this strike right now or else we'll be irreparably harmed and the court refused to do that,\" Juratovac said.\nJuratovac said even though these parties will meet in court on Wednesday, we shouldn't expect to see a decision.\n\"I guarantee there is going to be some good points made during tomorrow's hearing. The judge and his clerks are going to be looking into those issues, looking into this case and make the best decision they possible can,\" Juratovac said.\nThe two sides go to court in a Santa Clara County Superior Courtroom Wednesday at 1:30 p.m.\nRELATED: VTA, union hope Gov. Newsom will help them reach agreement to end strike",
