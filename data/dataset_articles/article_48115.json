The union claimed Inver House Distillers refused to reopen negotiations or engage with conciliation service Acas.\nIn the ballot, 78% of GMB members, who are seeking a 4% pay rise, backed strikes, while 87% backed action short of strikes.\nThe turnout was 71%.\nDavid Hume, GMB Scotland organiser in the whisky industry, said: “The ballot results reveal the determination of Inver House workers to take the action necessary to secure a fair pay offer.\n“The result could not be clearer and this rock-solid mandate from our members should send the clearest possible message to management.\n“They must reengage with negotiations, return to the table and find a fair resolution. If they do not, industrial action is now inevitable.”\nInver House’s distilleries comprise Balblair, Balmenach, Knockdhu, Old Pulteney and Speyburn.\nA spokesperson for Inver House Distillers commented: “We are disappointed by this decision. We have been fair in our approach to negotiations and would reiterate that this year’s pay rise was in line with inflation, as it is every year, and was accompanied by an annual bonus paid in December.\n“While we respect the rights of the individuals who voted in favour for this industrial strike action – 25 people across six sites, which equates to 8% of our workforce – we take great pride in being a fair and supportive employer, and in the strength of our teams and workplace communities across Scotland.”\nRelated news\nJohnnie Walker enters ‘new era of luxury Scotch’\nStarmer doubles down on pledge to ‘defend’ Scotch",
