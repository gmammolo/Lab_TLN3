  "text": "Workers at an Aberdeenshire distillery are among those set to go on strike amid an ongoing dispute about pay.\nGMB Scotland members at Inver House Distillers have rejected a pay offer of 3% from bosses with locations including Knockdhu in Aberdeenshire, Speyburn in Moray, Balblair in Balmenach and Old Pulteney in the Highlands.\nWarehouse workers in Airdrie are also included in the strike action.\n25 people - 8% of Inver House Distillers' workers - are involved in the planned industrial action.\nJoin Aberdeen Live’s WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages\nThe union has asked for a 4% pay rise for their staff, saying that Inver House Distillers \"must re-engage\" in negotiations in order to avoid \"inevitable\" strike action.\nUnion organiser David Hume said: \"They must re-engage with negotiations, return to the table and find a fair resolution.\n\"If they do not, industrial action is now inevitable.\"\nA spokesperson for Inver House Distillers said: \"We have been fair in our approach to negotiations and would reiterate that this year's pay rise was in line with inflation, as it is every year, and was accompanied by an annual bonus paid in December.\"\nSign up for Aberdeen Live's newsletter\nGet all the latest Aberdeen news and headlines sent straight to your inbox by signing up to our free newsletter.\nFrom breaking news in and around the city, to traffic and travel and health, we've got you covered.\nThe manually created newsletter arrives every day at around 4pm, giving you a round up of the most important stories we've covered that day.\nTo sign up, simply click this link here.\nAnd if you aren't already, make sure you join the conversation over on our Facebook Groups and Aberdeen Live Instagram.",
