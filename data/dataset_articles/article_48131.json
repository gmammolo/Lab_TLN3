  "text": "Infosys lays off trainees at Mysuru campus again, offers alternative roles in BPM\nThe IT giant has terminated 30-45 trainees after they failed internal assessments but is offering alternative roles in its Business Process Management (BPM) unit.\nInfosys has once again laid off trainees from its Mysuru training campus, this time terminating around 30 to 45 individuals after they failed to clear internal assessments. The company, however, has provided them with alternative career options, including training in its Business Process Management (BPM) unit.\nLayoffs follow internal assessment failures\nAccording to sources, the trainees were unable to qualify for the Foundation Skills Training Programme, an internal assessment required for them to continue their apprenticeship at Infosys. Despite being given additional preparation time, mock assessments, and doubt-clearing sessions, the affected trainees could not meet the company’s passing criteria.\nAs a result, Infosys informed them via email that they would no longer be able to continue their training, marking the second round of terminations at the Mysuru campus in just a few months. In January, Infosys had similarly let go of hundreds of trainees for failing assessments, a move that drew widespread criticism.\nCompany offers alternative career paths\nUnlike the previous terminations, this time Infosys has offered a second chance to affected trainees. The company has introduced a 12-week training programme in BPM to help them secure alternative roles.\nTrainees who choose this route will have an opportunity to work in the BPM unit after successfully completing their training. For those unwilling to take up BPM roles, Infosys has also promised to sponsor external training programs to help them secure jobs elsewhere.\nRelief measures for laid-off trainees\nTo ease the transition, Infosys has provided affected trainees with:\n- One-month ex-gratia salary\n- Relieving letters for future job applications\n- Transport assistance from Mysuru to Bengaluru for those who opt out of BPM\n- Accommodation at the Employee Care Centre in Mysuru until their departure\nThe company has set a deadline of March 27 for trainees to submit their travel and accommodation preferences.\nLabour Department clears Infosys of wrongdoing\nAfter backlash over the earlier layoffs, the Karnataka Labour Department investigated the matter and found that Infosys had not violated any labour laws. The Union Labour Ministry had also sought a report, following allegations that Infosys was terminating trainees unfairly.\nInfosys has maintained that its internal assessment policies have been in place for years and are necessary to ensure the quality of its workforce.\nFreshers hiring policies under scrutiny\nInfosys’ repeated layoffs of trainees have sparked concerns over its hiring and training policies. Critics argue that the company should reconsider how it evaluates freshers, especially given the uncertain job market in the IT sector.\nWhile Infosys has taken steps to mitigate the impact of these terminations, the IT giant may still face questions about whether its assessment system is too rigid and whether it should adopt a more supportive approach for struggling trainees.\nGet Latest Business News, Stock Market Updates and Videos; Check your tax outgo through Income Tax Calculator and save money through our Personal Finance coverage.
