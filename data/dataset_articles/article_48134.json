  "text": "Next Article\nInfosys terminates more trainees in second layoff round this year\nAkash Pandey\nWhat's the story\nInfosys has sacked another 30-45 trainees from its Mysuru campus for failing to clear internal assessments, according to Moneycontrol.\nThe decision comes two months after the company had let go of around 350 trainees from the same campus after a delay of over two-and-a-half years.\nThe Bengaluru-based IT company is offering an alternative career path to those affected by the terminations.\nCareer transition\nInfosys offers alternative career path to terminated trainees\nThe alternative career path offered by Infosys involves a 12-week training program for prospective roles in the company's Business Process Management (BPM) sector.\nThe company has also promised to sponsor this training for those opting for the BPM course.\nIn an email to the affected trainees, Infosys wrote, \"Further to the announcement of your final assessment attempt, please be informed that you have not met the qualifying criteria in 'Foundation skills training program' despite additional preparation time.\"\nSupport measures\nEx-gratia payment and travel arrangements\nAlong with the training program, Infosys is also providing a one-month ex-gratia payment and a relieving letter to the affected trainees.\nFor those who do not wish to take the BPM route, the company will provide transport from Mysuru to Bangalore and a standard travel allowance to their hometown.\nTrainees can also stay at the Employee Care Center in Mysuru until their date of departure, if required.\nLegal clearance\nKarnataka labor department clears Infosys of labor law violations\nOn February 27, the Karnataka Labor Department had cleared Infosys of any labor law violations in terminating these trainees. This was based on documentary evidence collected.\nThe department's officials had visited Infosys's campuses in Bengaluru and Mysuru to assess the situation after reports of trainee layoffs, following a mail from the Union Labor Ministry directing an inquiry into this matter.",
