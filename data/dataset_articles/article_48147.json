  "text": "Panera Bread has announced plans to close its fresh dough facility in Greensboro, North Carolina, on May 21, r esulting in 80 job losses. The company filed a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) with the North Carolina Department of Commerce last week, fulfilling the legal requirement to provide at least 60 days' notice before implementing mass layoffs. The Greenville facility is one of several production centers that have traditionally supplied Panera cafes with freshly mixed and shaped bread dough, as well as pastries and other baked goods. These facilities have been central to Panera's food preparation process for years. The closure comes as part of Panera's strategic shift toward an \"on-demand\" baking model. Under this new approach, the company will outsource dough production to third-party bakeries using Panera's recipes to create par-baked and frozen products. These items will then be delivered to individual cafes, where staff can bake them throughout the day as needed. This operational change has already led to multiple bakery closures across the United States as the company moves away from its traditional centralized fresh dough production system. Are you concerned by this news? Do you think this will impact the quality of Panera's food?
