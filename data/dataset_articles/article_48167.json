  "text": "Preconco Limited has strongly refuted claims made by the Barbados Workers Union (BWU) following a worker strike on Tuesday. Over 40 Preconco employees participated in the walkout, citing concerns about their working conditions.\nThe company stated it was “shocked and dismayed” by statements from BWU’s Deputy General Secretary, Dwaine Paul, who told the media that the strike stemmed from long-standing issues concerning wages, staff and management relations, and health and safety concerns.\nIn response, Preconco released a statement asserting that “these false allegations, which have been widely circulated, are not only misleading but also damaging to the reputation of our business, employees, and stakeholders.”\nFurthermore, the company insisted that the information provided by Paul regarding the strike’s causes “had not been previously brought to the attention of the company and do not form part of the ongoing discussions and negotiations with the BWU.”\n“We take these matters very seriously,” said Joshua Read, general manager of Preconco. “There are protocols governing the conduct and utterances of all parties involved. Our company affirms its commitment to said protocols and procedures and will take the appropriate actions as needed.”\nPreconco also defended its health and safety record, stating, “Preconco upholds the highest standards of health and safety in all aspects of its operations. We adhere to strict industry regulations, regularly undergo third-party audits, and consistently meet or exceed all local, national, and international health and safety and 5S standards. Any suggestion to the contrary is not only false, but also misrepresents the dedication of our hardworking team.”\n(PR/BT)",
