  "text": "Belgian rail unions form united front to maximise strike impact\nFive of the six Belgian railway unions have formed a joint front to better coordinate their strike actions and increase their impact. In a joint statement on Thursday morning, ACOD Spoor, ACV Transcom, VSOA Spoor, OVS, and ASTB announced a common action plan.\nThe smaller unions (VSOA Spoor, OVS, and ASTB) are aligning their actions with those of the two largest, ACOD Spoor and ACV Transcom, who have announced 24-hour strikes every Tuesday in April (8, 15, 22, and 29 April). Further escalation is expected in May.\nRail unions announce 18 strike days in next 5 months\nbelganewsagency.eu\nMetisp-Protect, a sixth, smaller union, is not part of the coalition but is currently holding a week-long strike. All unions will take part in a national general strike on Monday 31 March.\nThe actions are in response to federal government plans to raise the retirement age, increase flexibility for rail workers, cut budgets, and reform HR Rail, the legal employer of railway staff.\n© BELGA PHOTO NICOLAS MAETERLINCK\nRelated News\nThousands take to streets of Brussels in protest at new government's plans\nbelganewsagency.eu",
