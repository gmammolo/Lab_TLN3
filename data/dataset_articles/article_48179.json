This change does not alter our current project plans.\"\nIt's unclear whether any specific projects or departments have been impacted by the cuts.\nCrystal Dynamics is currently working on the next entry in the Tomb Raider franchise, which is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and will be published by Amazon Games.\nIt would represent the first major release for the studio since it was\nacquired by Swedish conglomerate and layoff merchant Embracer Group in 2022.\nThe studio is also co-developing the upcoming Perfect Dark reboot alongside The Initiative.\nEmbracer purchased Crystal Dynamics from Square Enix alongside other studios including Eidos-Montreal, Square Enix Montreal in a deal worth $300 million. It also bought the rights to key franchises like Deus Ex, Thief, and Tomb Raider.\nAfter completing that deal,\nEmbracer embarked upon a widespread restructuring program that resulted in mass layoffs, studio closures, notable divestments, and project cancellations.\nThat seemingly included a\nround of job cuts at Crystal Dynamics in 2023.\nGame Developer has reached out to Embracer for more information about the latest redundancies.\nRead more about:\nYou May Also Like\nTrending\nThe Heritage Foundation's manifesto for the possible next administration could do great harm to many, including large portions of the game development community.",
