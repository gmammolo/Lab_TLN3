  "text": "Tomb Raider Studio Crystal Dynamics Has Suffered a Round of Layoffs\nThursday, March 27, 2025\nCrystal Dynamics, the developer behind the modern Tomb Raider series (from Tomb Raider Legend onward) has announced layoffs, in what it calls a “difficult decision”.\nAccording to the developer, seventeen “talented team members” have been let go, although it's not clear which teams have been affected by the layoffs. Currently, Crystal Dynamics is working on the Perfect Dark reboot alongside Xbox studio The Initiative, as well as a new Tomb Raider instalment, rumoured to be a fully open-world affair set in India.\n“This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members. We did not make this decision lightly,” the developer writes in a statement. “Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio’s future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected.”\nThe studio notes that it's supporting employees impacted by the layoffs with “transition packages and opportunity outreach,” and affirms its commitment to “pushing the boundaries of making great games,” adding: “This change does not alter our current project plans.”\nMeanwhile, it's been more than six years since we last saw Lara Croft in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, so perhaps it's high time we saw the intrepid explorer's long-awaited return.",
