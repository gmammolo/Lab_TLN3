Ferrero\nMadrid\n03/27/2025\nUpdated at 14: 16h.\n“Labor absenteeism, and especially that not justified by a temporary disability, remains at high levels, which impacts very negatively on the productivity and competitiveness of companies,” says Valentín Bote, director of Randstad Research. Since the end of 2022, the level of absenteeism remains above 6% and since the end of 2023 the absenteeism by IT exceeds 5%. Thus, the number of employees who on average did not attend their workplace every day in 2023 reached 1,463,544 of which 1,137,500 were on a medical leave, according to the ‘Labor Ability report | Fourth quarter 2024 ‘published today by Randstad.\nWorrying figures if compared to the results obtained a year ago, registering at the close of 2024 increases of 6% and 5% of the number of people who were absent from their working day in a general way and by IT, respectively, as indicated by the report. In the Spanish labor market as a whole, of the 1.46 million employees that are missing every day to their job, more than 326,000 people do so for reasons other than a medical decline, that is, 22.2% do not have a temporary disability For medical reasons.\nAccording to these data, general absenteeism has caused a Loss of 6.7% of the agreed hours which represents a tenth rebound regarding the data registered one year earlier. For absenteeism due to temporary disability (IT) or with medical leave, the fourth quarter rate was 5.2%, two tenths higher than the one accounted for in the fourth quarter of last year.\nThe industry, the sector most affected by work absenteeism\nThe industry It is the sector that, at the end of 2024, is positioned at the head in absenteeism in the whole country, by concentrating the highest number of workers who do not go to their job, adding 7.2% of the agreed hours. Among the other two major economic sectors, the sector services with 6.7%, it stands behind industry, and, thirdly, the construction It remains with the lowest rate, with 5.6%. Same positions occupy these sectors in the case of absenteeism by IT: industry (5.5%), services (5.2%) and construction (4.7%).\n«The most detailed analysis By activities it exposes a pronounced difference since while in some the levels are reduced others have a large number of lost hours, ”they point out from Randstad. Thus, the activities that have greater absenteeism are gambling and bets, with a rate of 11.9%; ahead of postal activities and emails, with 11.8%; services to buildings and gardening, with 11.2%; assistance in residential establishments, with 10.6%; and manufacture of motor vehicles, with 10.3%. On the opposite side, activities with less absenteeism are those related to employment (2.7%); legal and accounting (2.8%); real estate (3.5%); R&D (3.6%) and technical services of architecture and engineering (3.7%).\nBasques and Canaries the most absentee\nIn the analysis of the behavior of the autonomous communities in their absenteeism rates, the Basque Country It is the CC.AA. that records greater absenteeism at the end of 2024, with a total of 8.7% of the agreed hours, due in large part to the strong industrial presence in the community, attached to it is Canary Islands with 8.4%. The ranking is followed by Galicia and Cantabria, who occupy the third and fourth place, both with 7.8%. In contrast, the lowest levels record them Balearics (5.7%), Community of Madrid (5.8%), Valencian Community (6.1%) and Andalusia (6.2%).\nRioja It has been the Autonomous Community where absenteeism has increased the most, growing eight tenths to 6.4%; Ahead of Cantabria, with an increase of six tenths, to 7.8%, and Murcia, with an advance of five tenth absenteeism, to 7.7%. While, the only community that has registered a decrease has been Estremadura reducing six tenths to 6.4%. At the same time, three communities have not registered variation: Catalonia (6.9%), Andalusia (6.2%) and Valencian Community (6.1%).\nReport an error\n#Labor #absenteeism #continues #grow #million #people #missing #work #day",
