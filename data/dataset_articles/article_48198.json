  "text": "A union that represents a few hundred employees at a GM assembly plant in Oshawa says that it will convene an “emergency meeting” today to prepare its response to a 25 per cent tariff that the U.S. plans to impose on imported vehicles.\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced the new tariff on Wednesday afternoon, though it will not formally take effect until April 3.\nAuto industry officials have warned that the levy will potentially have devastating consequences on the North American auto industry and could even prompt some assembly lines to stop production.\nThe impact could be particularly outside in Oshawa, where more than 3,000 employees work at a General Motors assembly plant.\nUnifor Local 222 represents more than 200 of those workers and is convening an emergency meeting with other union representatives today to discuss its response to the tariffs.\nWorkers are also expected to stage a rally outside the GM assembly plant to draw attention to their concerns.\nUnifor National President Lana Payne is expected to be among those in attendance.\n“We are calling everyone down here, we are having an emergency tariff meeting, we are going to go over our strategy and what we are going to do,” Local 222 President Jeff Gray told CP24 on Thursday morning. “They (GM) are not taking one piece of equipment out of our plants. We are going to react if that is the case.”\nTrump has said that the tariffs are designed to get auto manufacturers to relocate their plants to the U.S.\nHowever, GM and other manufacturers have not signalled any intentions to scale back their Canadian operations at this point.\nSpeaking with CP24, Gray called the tariffs “malicious” and “ignorant” of how the industry actually works, noting that vehicles and parts sometimes cross the border six to nine times before being assembled into a final product.\n“Our members we have gone through a little bit of a cycle in the last month. We have gone from being anxious and nervous to now I believe we are sick of being antagonized by Donald Trump,” he said. “These are our jobs. We fought for these jobs for the last 90 years here in Oshawa. We fought for them through collective bargaining and we paid financial and emotional prices. These jobs aren’t going anywhere.”\nThe Ontario government has previously said that more than 100,000 Ontarians are employed in the auto assembly and parts manufacturing sectors.\nIn a press conference on Wednesday, Premier Doug Ford told reporters that he supports “dollar for dollar” tariffs in response to the 25 per cent auto tariff.\nHe also said that he has encouraged Prime Minister Mark Carney to target American-made cars in any response.\n“We either roll over as a country and he (Trump) runs us over 15 times and gets what he wants, or we feel a little bit of pain and we fight like we’ve never fought before,” Ford said.",
