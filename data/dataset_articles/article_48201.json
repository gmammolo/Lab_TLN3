  "text": "US fintech Block reportedly laying off 931 staffUS fintech Block reportedly laying off 931 staff\nCEO Jack Dorsey reportedly informed Block employees about the cuts via an email on Tuesday, which has since been published by TechCrunch.\nCameron Emanuel-Burns\nMarch 27, 2025\nUS-based fintech group Block is reportedly laying off 931 staff, approximately 8% of its workforce, according to a leaked email to employees from CEO Jack Dorsey published by TechCrunch.\nIn the email, which TechCrunch reports was sent to staff on Tuesday, Dorsey says the company will be \"making some org changes, including eliminating roles and beginning the consultation process in countries where required\".\nDorsey outlines that 391 employees will be leaving to reduce teams that \"are off strategy\", 460 workers will be let go due to performance, and 80 managers will also depart to flatten the company's hierarchy. Moreover, the CEO notes that 193 managers will transition to \"individual contributor roles\".\nIn addition, Dorsey, who co-founded Block in 2009, also revealed the closure of 748 open job positions, with exceptions only for critical operational, leadership, and offer-stage roles.\nDorsey clarifies that the layoffs are not being carried out to \"hit a specific financial target\", alter the company's headcount limit, or to replace individuals with AI. Instead, he explains, \"they are specific to our needs around strategy, raising the bar and acting faster on performance, and flattening our org so we can move faster and with less abstraction\".\nBlock, which operates well-known brands such as CashApp, Afterpay, Square, and the music streaming service Tidal, also underwent a separate reorganisation last year, cutting around 1,000 jobs.",
