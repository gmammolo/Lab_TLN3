  "text": "ESPN has reportedly given its employees a significant “ultimatum” with more significant changes on the horizon. The Worldwide Leader in Sports has undergone plenty of changes over the last two years, beginning with a long series of talent cuts in 2023. Now, the network is reportedly relocating one of its shows and giving its employees the chance to relocate or leave altogether. According to a report from Andrew Marchand of The Athletic, ESPN told the “SportsCenter” employees in Los Angeles that the program and positions are moving to Bristol, Connecticut, where the company headquarters are located. Per Marchand, employees in Los Angeles can relocate to Bristol or leave the network: “NEWS: ESPN informed Los Angles based SportsCenter employees that it is moving the show and the positions associated with it to Bristol. The NBA shows, like NBA Today, are remaining in LA. SportsCenter employees have the option to move to continue employment, according to a source briefed on the moves.” Additionally, Mollie Cahillane of Front Office Sports reports that the move will impact 35 of 229 Disney/ESPN employees in Los Angeles, The 1:00 a.m. EST show, along with ESPN’s soccer programming, will air in Bristol. Employees who leave will be eligible for severance pay. Popular ESPN personality Scott Van Pelt hosts SportsCenter from a studio in Washington, with the 1:00 a.m. EST shows running in Los Angeles. In early 2023, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that the company would cut 7,000 jobs as a way to save $5.5 billion. That included the releases of marquee ESPN talents like Suzy Kolber, Steve Young, Max Kellerman, Jalen Rose, Jeff Van Gundy, Mark Jackson, Matt Hasselbeck, Todd McShay and Keyshawn Johnson. Additionally, it was reported last week that the company’s broadcast agreement with Major League Baseball will end after the 2025 season. This means the league will no longer hold the feat of owning broadcast rights for each of the four major North American professional sports leagues, though they have long-term deals with the NFL, NBA and NHL secured. And now, employees on the West Coast are being told to either join the move back East or pack their bags.
