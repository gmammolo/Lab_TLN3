  "text": "More than 100 CFS workers with two Métis child and family services authorities in Manitoba say they’re walking a picket line to push for higher wages.\nAccording to Kyle Ross, president of the union, workers want the same pay as their provincial counterparts.\n“These workers have the same education, they support the same type of families, the same types of individuals that need these supports. And we really think they should be paid the same as everyone else,” said Ross.\n“With everything going on in the environment, with inflation, all these things, these workers are feeling those pinches.”\nThe workers are employed by two agencies governed by the Manitoba Métis Federation – the Michif Child and Family Services and the Métis Child and Family Community Services.",
