  "text": "( The Hill ) — Florida lawmakers are considering major changes to state child labor laws that would loosen restrictions on when and how long teens can work, as the state braces for a shortage of migrant workers under GOP-led immigration crackdowns. A state Senate panel narrowly advanced a proposal Tuesday to eliminate regulations that bar 16- and 17-year-olds from working jobs before 6:30 a.m. or after 11 p.m. on school days, working more than eight hours on school days and working more than 30 hours a week while in school. The proposal also would end a requirement that teens receive at least 30-minute meal breaks when they work eight-hour shifts. Additionally, it would eliminate some restrictions on employing 14- and 15-year-olds who are home-schooled or enrolled in virtual schools. A separate measure advancing in the state House would allow teens who are employed as interns or trainees to be paid below the state’s $13-an-hour minimum wage, which is set to increase to $15-an-hour next year. The Tallahassee Democrat reported that supporters of the changes say that the measures will give teens experience and skills that will help them later in life. Opponents argue that the bills promote child exploitation and could affect their schooling. Florida has been facing a steep shortage of workers. According to figures from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, there are about 53 available workers for every 100 open jobs in the state. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who unsuccessfully sought the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination, signed a law in 2023 aimed at cracking down on immigration in the state by punishing employers who hire undocumented workers. Florida also prevents local governments from providing driver’s licenses to undocumented people. Opponents of the legislation raised concerns about the impact on the state’s major industries — including tourism, agriculture and construction — rely on immigrant labor. During a recent immigration-focused discussion with President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan at the New College of Florida in Sarasota, DeSantis offered up the idea of teens filling the gaps left by undocumented workers. “They said, ‘Oh, you know, you’re not going to be able to hire people’ or whatever,” DeSantis said. “What’s wrong with expecting, like, our young people to be working part time now? I mean, like, that’s how it used to be when I was growing up.” He specifically pointed to the sprawling resorts that dot the Florida coastlines as providing a money-making opportunity for teens. “Why do we say we need to import foreigners … when you know teenagers used to work at these resorts?” he said. “College students should be. It’s like, you go $30,000 in debt, you just take loans, you’re not expected to work at all. I think the priorities have been jumbled, and I think there’s absolutely people that would be able to do.” Several states, including Arkansas and Iowa, have sought to roll back youth labor laws in recent years, citing workforce shortages.
