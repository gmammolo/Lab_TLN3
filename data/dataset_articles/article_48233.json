  "text": "Illinois\nReport Says Illinois Company Specializing in Returns to Layoff 76\nBy Doc Holliday,\n1 hours agoThere is a new report that indicates more Illinois jobs are being reduced as a company specializing in returns plans to layoff 76 according to a notice to the state. I noticed a new alert from the Illinois Work Net website which says the state was just notified that a logistics company plans to layoff 76 workers. The WARN notice says that Quiet Logistics, Inc located at 1333 N Hickory Ave in Chicago, Illinois plans to close a plant with layoffs for 76 workers to be effective on May 23, 2025.",
