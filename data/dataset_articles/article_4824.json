  "text": "Swift Fire Service response saves buildings in Madina Zongo Junction blaze\nThe Ghana National Fire Service has successfully contained a commercial fire that broke out at Madina Zongo Junction in Accra, preventing it from spreading to adjoining buildings and averting possible casualties.\nAccording to an update issued by the Service, the fire, which occurred on Wednesday, January 21, 2026, affected three shops located on the ground floor of a one-storey building at the busy commercial area.\nThe GNFS said it received a distress call at 16:41 hours, after which a combined team from the Madina and Legon Fire Stations was immediately dispatched to the scene. Firefighters from the Madina Station arrived within two minutes, at 16:43 hours, and swiftly commenced operations to bring the blaze under control.\nThe statement said the fire was successfully contained by 17:00 hours and was completely extinguished at 17:25 hours, bringing the incident under control in under 45 minutes.\n“One (1) shop and its contents were completely burnt, while the remaining two (2) shops and their contents were partially affected,” the Fire Service said, adding that no injuries or fatalities were recorded.\nThe Service credited the rapid and professional response of its personnel for preventing the fire from spreading to neighbouring structures in the densely built area. It said several adjoining buildings, including a forex bureau, were saved from destruction.\nThe cause of the fire has not yet been established and remains under investigation by the relevant authorities.\nThe update, filed by the Public Relations Officer at the GNFS Headquarters, reaffirmed the Service’s commitment to rapid response and effective fire containment, particularly in high-risk commercial zones.",
