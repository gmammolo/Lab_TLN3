  "text": "Crystal Dynamics, the developers behind the recent Tomb Raider games, has announced that it has held layoffs at the studio.\nIn an announcement on LinkedIn, the studio said that it made the “difficult decision” to let go 17 people from the company. In it’s statement, they said that the decision wasn’t made “lightly”.\n“Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio’s future success,” the statement reads. “It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected.\n“We recognize how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach.”\nThe statement ended with the studio saying that it “remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games” nor does it change any of their current projects.\nInsider Gaming has reached out to Crystal Dynamics for more details on the support and “transition packages” the impacted employees are receiving. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.\nCrystal Dynamics is just the latest studio to hold layoffs in 2025. As of publishing, roughly 1,500 confirmed jobs have been lost across nearly 50 companies this year.\nFor more Insider Gaming, check out what popular map is returning to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 in Season 3.
