  "text": "SCOTTISH Water workers are set to stage a mass walkout as staff take action over pay dispute, says UNISON today.\nScotland’s largest union says that workers will go on strike for 24 hours from the early hours of tomorrow morning after an overwhelming vote for action.\nUNISON has warned that the strike will lead to disruption to water and sewage systems across the country, as emergency repairs and water quality checks will not be carried out.\nIf people report problems with their water supply, sewage or drainage, complaints won’t be dealt with until the strike ends on Saturday.\nScottish Water has offered employees a wage increase this year of 2.6% or £1,050, whichever is the higher amount.\nPhoto by Luis Tosta on Unsplash The union says this does not even begin to compensate workers for a decade of pay cuts and fails to recognise the valuable jobs they do.\nUNISON Scotland regional organiser Emma Phillips said: “These staff work incredibly hard to keep Scotland’s water clean.\n“It’s no wonder they’re so dismayed by Scottish Water’s dirty tactics.\n“Employees are sick of being taken for granted and underpaid, while their work is farmed out to private contractors, at even greater expense to the public.\n“Workers have suffered a decade of pay cuts and wages haven’t kept up with inflation.\n“Staff have been left feeling undervalued, and the company is struggling to retain its workforce. Things need to change, and that must start today.”\nBranch secretary for UNISON Scottish Water Tricia McArthur said: “Strike action is always a last resort and no one wants to see services disrupted.\n“But staff feel they’ve been left with no choice.\n“Industrial relations at Scottish Water are at an all-time low.\n“The workforce is being run down and under-utilised while work is transferred – at an increased cost – to private contractors. This is backdoor privatisation.\n“Scottish Water workers deserve to be paid fairly for the services they provide.\n“It’s important this vital publicly-owned service that so many rely on is protected, as are its dedicated workforce.”",
