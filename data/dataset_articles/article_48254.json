  "text": "Health and Human Services to cut 10,000 jobs\nThe workforce will decrease from 82,000 to 62,000 positions.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday announced it will cut 10,000 jobs as the agency undergoes a reconstruction plan.\n\"The restructuring will address this and serve multiple goals without impacting critical services,\" the agency announced on its website. \"First, it will save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year through a reduction in workforce of about 10,000 full-time employees who are part of this most recent transformation.\"\nThe workforce will drop from 82,000 to 62,000 positions.\nThere are currently 28 units in HHS and the agency is planning to consolidate them into 15 new divisions, including a new Administration for a Healthy America.\n“We aren't just reducing bureaucratic sprawl,\" agency Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said. \"We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic. This Department will do more – a lot more – at a lower cost to the taxpayer.”",
