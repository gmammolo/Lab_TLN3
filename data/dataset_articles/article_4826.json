  "text": "Input Stories\nHouse Committee Advances Most Comprehensive CAA Revisions in 35 Years\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee has approved seven manufacturer-supported Clean Air Act–related measures, thanks in part to NAM advocacy.\nWhat’s going on: The approved measures—which constitute the most comprehensive revision to the CAA in over three decades—“will foster our industry’s ongoing efforts to improve air quality while preventing unnecessary burdens that reduce economic growth and tax revenues that are vital to local communities,” NAM Vice President of Domestic Policy Chris Phalen and NAM Director of Energy and Resources Policy Mike Davin told Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-KY) and Ranking Member Frank Pallone (D-NJ) ahead of a full markup Wednesday morning.\n- The action follows NAM-backed approval of the measures last month by the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on the Environment.\nWhy it’s crucial: There are “mounting permitting challenges facing American businesses under increasingly unattainable air quality standards,” the NAM said. “Unless addressed, these challenges will essentially block permitting approvals for projects critical to economic growth, manufacturing infrastructure and jobs.”\nThe details: Prior to the hearing, the NAM had called on committee members to “favorably report to the House floor” the following measures specifically:\n- The New Source Review Permitting Improvement Act, which would reform the New Source Review program for existing sources by clarifying which types of facility modifications require an owner to obtain an NSR\n- The Clean Air and Economic Advancement Reform Act, which would make the National Ambient Air Quality Standards “process more workable for manufacturers,” while keeping regulatory guardrails in place to protect local communities\n- The Clean Air and Building Infrastructure Improvement Act, which aims to clarify the preconstruction permit process and compliance requirements\n- The Air Permitting Improvements to Protect National Security Act, to establish presidential authority under the CAA to waive the requirement for an advanced manufacturing plant or critical mineral facility to offset increased emissions\n- The Fire Improvement and Reforming Exceptional Events Act, which would amend the CAA to mandate revisions to regulations around the review and handling of air quality monitoring data influenced by “exceptional events”\n- The Reducing and Eliminating Duplicative Environmental Regulations Act, to eliminate the requirement that the Environmental Protection Agency review a project already subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act\n- The Foreign Emissions and Nonattainment Clarification for Economic Stability Act, which would amend the CAA to clarify standards for emissions that come from outside the U.S.\nView More",
