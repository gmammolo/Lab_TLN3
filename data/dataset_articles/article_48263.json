  "text": "The All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), on Thursday, criticised the working conditions of Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) in Telangana, alleging that they are overworked and underpaid.\nA delegation led by the Telangana State ASHA Workers’ Union submitted a petition to National Health Mission (NHM) chief programming officer Padmaja highlighting that ASHA workers, despite being hired on a result-based remuneration model, are forced to work beyond eight hours a day.\nThe union also pointed out the lack of social security measures, alleging that authorities are bypassing the implementation of mandatory benefits like Provident Fund (PF) and Employees’ State Insurance (ESI).\nAITUC State Deputy General Secretary M. Narasimha demanded that minimum wages and labour laws be enforced for ASHA workers, who, he said, are unfairly treated with honorarium-based and fixed wages instead of proper remuneration.\nIn their memorandum, the union demanded a minimum wage of ₹26,000 per month, along with PF and ESI benefits. They also called for ₹10 lakh health and accident insurance coverage, a retirement benefit of ₹5 lakh, and weightage for ASHA workers in competitive examinations. Additionally, they urged the government to ensure that the families of deceased ASHAs are provided employment opportunities.\nPublished - March 27, 2025 08:03 pm IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",
