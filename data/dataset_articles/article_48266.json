Despite these reductions, sectors like AI, fintech, and big data are expected to see growth by 2030.\nThis wave of mass layoffs around the globe has not left India untouched. On March 26, software giant Infosys terminated approximately 30 to 45 trainees from its Mysuru campus after they failed to pass internal assessments.\nLayoffs in 2025: List of Companies Laying off their Employees\nBlock: Jack Dorsey’s financial technology company, plans to lay off nearly 1,000 employees while implementing other operational changes in its second such move in just over a year. The layoffs will affect more than 930 employees, with nearly 200 managers transitioning into non-management roles, and around 800 open positions being closed.\nDorsey, who co-founded and previously ran Twitter before co-founding Block in 2009, informed employees of the upcoming cuts on Tuesday via an email titled “smaller block,” which was viewed by the Guardian.\nInternational Business Machines: IBM, known as ‘Big Blue,’ is reportedly cutting jobs across various U.S. locations as part of an ongoing workforce reduction in the tech industry. The company’s decision follows a wave of layoffs this year affecting thousands of employees.\nAccording to The Register, IBM’s job cuts are targeting around a quarter of its workforce within its Classic Cloud operations. While the exact number of affected employees remains undisclosed, the layoffs are expected to impact thousands. IBM has yet to make an official announcement on the matter.\nBoeing: On February 8, Boeing announced plans to cut 400 roles from its moon rocket program due to delays and rising costs associated with NASA's Artemis moon exploration missions. A spokesperson stated that impacted employees will receive 60-day notices of involuntary layoffs in the coming weeks.\nInfosys: Software giant Infosys terminated approximately 30 to 45 trainees from its Mysuru campus on March 26, after they failed to pass internal assessments. However, the company is offering alternative career paths to the affected trainees, including a 12-week training program for potential roles in Infosys Business Process Management (BPM).\nIn addition, Infosys is providing impacted trainees with a one-month ex-gratia payment and a relieving letter. For those who choose not to pursue the BPM course, the company has offered to fund further training to help them explore other career opportunities.\nAdidas: In January, Adidas announced plans to reduce its workforce at its headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany, potentially cutting up to 500 jobs, according to CNBC.

Despite strong financial performance, the company proceeded with the workforce reduction as part of ongoing restructuring efforts.\nCNN: CNN announced a reduction of about 200 television-focused roles, accounting for approximately 6% of its workforce, as part of a shift toward a digital-first strategy. In a memo sent to staff on January 23, CNN CEO Mark Thompson emphasized the need to \"shift CNN's gravity towards the platforms and products where the audience themselves are shifting\" to secure the company’s future as a leading global news organization.\nBlackRock: In January, BlackRock informed employees of plans to cut around 200 jobs from its 21,000-strong workforce, according to Bloomberg. However, these reductions are offset by the addition of 3,750 new hires last year and another 2,000 expected in 2025. BlackRock's president, Rob Kapito, and COO, Rob Goldstein, stated that the layoffs were part of an effort to realign the firm's resources with its strategic goals.\nAmid ongoing economic uncertainties and restructuring across industries, the wave of mass layoffs in the tech sector continues without indication of slowing down.\nPublished March 27th 2025, 19:54 IST",
