  "text": "Sky to axe about 2,000 call centre jobs in three locations\nCall centres will be closed as more customers head online\nAbout 2,000 jobs are to be axed at Sky as part of a shake-up of the media company’s call centres.\nThe company, which is owned by US media giant Comcast, plans to shut three of its 10 call centres.\nThey are in Stockport, Sheffield and central Leeds.\nSky said that about seven per cent of its workforce would be affected by the changes.\n“We’re transforming our business to deliver quicker, simpler and more digital customer service,” a spokesperson said.\n“Our customers increasingly want choice, to speak to us on the phone when they need us most and the ease of managing everyday tasks digitally.\n“We’re investing in a new centre of excellence for customer service, alongside cutting-edge digital technology to make our service seamless, reliable, and available 24/7.”\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments",
