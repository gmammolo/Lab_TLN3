  "text": "JACK SMITH HEARING LIVE: Trump Behind Jan 6 And Epstein's Death? Smith Reveals BIG SecretsExplosive testimony has reignited controversy as Special Counsel Jack Smith reveals that Donald Trump was actively seeking ways to remain in power after losing the 2020 presidential election. Speaking during questioning by Representative Zoe Lofgren, Smith stated that Trump was not searching for the truth about election fraud but instead embraced “fantastical” theories that could help him hold onto power. The revelations shed new light on Trump’s mindset following his defeat and intensify scrutiny over alleged election interference and threats to American democracy. #Trump2020 #JackSmithTestimony #TrumpElectionInterference #TrumpStayInPower #2020Election #TrumpInvestigation #ElectionFraudClaims #ZoeLofgren #TrumpNews #BreakingPolitics #USPolitics #TrumpIndictment #DemocracyUnderThreat #CapitolRiotAftermath #TrumpLegalTroubles #SpecialCounselSmith #ElectionResults #TrumpStateOfMind #oneindianews #oneindiaenglish #breakingnews #worldnews #englishnewslive #englishnews #latestnews #news News that speaks your language – Oneindia App is now live | Click on the below link to download https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greynium.oneindia&hl=en_IN Oneindia News is a youth-driven channel that brings you stories that need your attention, are popular, informative, and entertaining.
