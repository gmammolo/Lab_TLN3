  "text": "Advertisement\nUpdated March 27th 2025, 20:16 IST\nMassive Job Cuts: Trump Admin Slashes 10,000 HHS Positions to Save $1.8 Billion Annually\nThe job cuts will bring down the department’s staff strength from 82,000 to 72,000, resulting in an estimated annual savings of $1.8 billion.\nWorld News\n- 3 min read\nSurabhi Shaurya\nNew Delhi: The Donald Trump administration has announced a massive reduction in the workforce of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), cutting 10,000 positions in a bid to streamline operations and reduce costs.\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that the job cuts will bring down the department’s staff strength from 82,000 to 72,000, resulting in an estimated annual savings of $1.8 billion. The move is part of the administration’s broader effort to downsize government agencies and improve efficiency.\n“The restructuring will address this and serve multiple goals without impacting critical services. First, it will save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year through a reduction in workforce of about 10,000 full-time employees who are part of this most recent transformation. When combined with HHS’ other efforts, including early retirement and Fork in the Road, the restructuring results in a total downsizing from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees.”, an official press release issued by\nHHS read.\nStreamlining HHS: RFK Jr's Plan\nThe restructuring will streamline the functions of the Department. Currently, the 28 divisions of the HHS contain many redundant units. The restructuring plan will consolidate them into 15 new divisions, including a new Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, and will centralize core functions such as Human Resources, Information Technology, Procurement, External Affairs, and Policy. Regional offices will be reduced from 10 to 5.\nThe overhaul will implement the new HHS priority of ending America’s epidemic of chronic illness by focusing on safe, wholesome food, clean water, and the elimination of environmental toxins. These priorities will be reflected in the reorganization of HHS.\nThe restructuring will improve Americans’ experience with HHS by making the agency more responsive and efficient, while ensuring that Medicare, Medicaid, and other essential health services remain intact.\n“We aren't just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said. “This Department will do more – a lot more – at a lower cost to the taxpayer.”\nTerming the move a beneficial step for both taxpayers and the public, Secretary Kennedy stated that bureaucracies like HHS tend to become inefficient over time, despite having dedicated and competent staff.\nHe stated that the overhaul aims to streamline operations and improve efficiency, aligning with the administration’s broader objective of enhancing the nation’s healthcare system under the “Make America Healthy Again” initiative.\nFor the unversed, the Trump administration has been pushing for cost-cutting measures across several federal agencies, citing the need to reduce government expenditure. The HHS job reduction follows similar moves in other departments as part of the administration’s restructuring plans.\nPublished March 27th 2025, 20:16 IST",
