  "text": "The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has announced plans to lay off 10.000 full-time employees, in addition to the 10.000 others who have already left.\nHHS plans to consolidate 28 existing agencies into 15, including the new Healthy America Agency. It is also reducing the number of regional offices from 10 to 5. These measures should save $1.8 billion a year.\nSecretary Robert F. Kennedy Junior noted that reform is not just about reducing bureaucracy, but also about strategic direction toward combating chronic diseases.\nThe largest cuts will be at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA): 3,500 jobs, with no impact on inspections and approvals of drugs and food. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): 2.400 jobs. National Institutes of Health (NIH): 1.200 jobs through centralization of departments. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid will focus on several existing services such as primary health care, mental health, maternal and child health, environmental protection, and the fight against HIV.\nNew offices are also planned: an assistant minister for oversight and a new office for strategy, which will improve the effectiveness of health policies.The layoffs are expected to take effect on May 27. The first notices to employees could arrive by the end of the week, and the layoffs will mostly affect administrative positions and multiple overlapping roles, it reports. KosovaPress.",
