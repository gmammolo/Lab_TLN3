  "text": "Premier Bank faces labour adviser’s stern warning\nLabour and Employment Adviser Brig Gen (Retired) M Sakhawat Hussain today warned Premier Bank of action if it does not disburse cash incentives by the government meant for a garment factory to clear wages ahead of the Eid.\nSpeaking at a press conference at the secretariat in Dhaka, Hussain said the bank was adjusting previous loans of Apparels Eco Ltd, a concern of TNZ Group, instead of releasing the funds designated for workers' wages.\nHe urged the bank's managing director to immediately disburse the amount, warning of stern action otherwise.\n\"You must release the money. If your bank does not comply, you will be held responsible,\" he said.\n\"I will file a criminal case against him. The money has already been provided to the bank, disbursed from the Bangladesh Bank.\"\nHussain said that the funds were government incentives, not subject to loan adjustments.\n\"The government has released this money. There is no provision for adjusting loans with it,\" he said.\nCriticising the bank's stance, he said, \"Premier Bank provided the factory with loans but later forgot its responsibility. This is the workers' money—you must release it. If you do not, remember, I am here as long as I am alive.\"\nHe also warned of action against the bank, its branch, its managing director, and its manager if the disbursement was further delayed.\n\"I have heard that Premier Bank continues to adjust the money instead of releasing it. I am asking the managing director once again—please disburse the funds. You are a private bank; do not take this lightly.\"\n\"The government has arranged this money. If Premier Bank refuses to disburse it, this will be considered an act against the state and the government,\" he added.\n\"I will take whatever action is necessary. This is the government's money—do not stand against the government. Do not test our patience,\" he warned.\nThe Daily Star tried to reach Mohammad Abu Jafar, managing director and CEO of Premier Bank, over the phone regarding the issue.\nIn response, an official of the bank said, \"We have already disbursed the payment, but it was done after receiving approval from the central bank.\"",
