British Steel is the UK’s second largest steelmaker and blamed environmental costs among others:\n“ The blast furnaces and steelmaking operations are no longer financially sustainable due to highly challenging market conditions, the imposition of tariffs and higher environmental costs relating to the production of high-carbon steel… The company had sought support from the UK government for a major capital investment in two new electric arc furnaces. However, following many months of negotiations no agreement has been reached.”\nMinisters had offered £500 million to help keep electric arc furnaces open which was rejected by Jinye.
