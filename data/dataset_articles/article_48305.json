  "text": "Crystal Dynamics Hit With Layoffs - News\nWilliam D'Angelo, posted 1 hour ago / 247 Views\nDeveloper Crystal Dynamics announced it is laying off 17 employees.\n\"This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members,\" said Crystal Dynamics. \"We did not make this decision lightly. Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio’s future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected.\n\"We recognize how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach.\n\"Crystal Dynamics remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games. This change does not alter our current project plans.\"\nThe studio is co-developing Perfect Dark and is working on a new entry in the Tomb Raider series.\nA life-long and avid gamer, William D'Angelo was first introduced to VGChartz in 2007. After years of supporting the site, he was brought on in 2010 as a junior analyst, working his way up to lead analyst in 2012 and taking over the hardware estimates in 2017. He has expanded his involvement in the gaming community by producing content on his own YouTube channel and Twitch channel. You can contact the author on Bluesky.\nMore Articles",
