  "text": "Union: Investor looks to sell Big River Steel\nMISSISSIPPI COUNTY, Ark. (KAIT) - The United Steelworkers says an “activist investor” in U.S. Steel wants to sell the Big River Steel plants near Osceola.\nAccording to a letter sent to its members, the union stated Ancora Holdings Group has plans to sell the two “state-of-the-art” plants and invest that money in union-run blast furnaces in Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania.\nAncora is an investor in U.S. Steel, which owns Big River Steel (BRS) and BRS 2.\nU.S. Steel cited a March 26 Bloomberg article announcing Ancora’s plans in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as it looks to complete a $14.1 billion deal with Nippon Steel Corporation. That agreement expires in mid-June.\nUSW stated in its letter to union members that Big River “poses a threat to its members and to U.S. national security.”\nIn the SEC filing, U.S. Steel claimed some of Ancora’s board nominees and CEO replacement “have financially benefited from ties with competitor Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc.”\nU.S. Steel also stated that the activist investor “has no actionable path forward.”\nTo report a typo or correction, please click here.\nCopyright 2025 KAIT.
