  "text": "Sunday World Newsletter\nSign up for the latest news and updates\nKaren’s Diner only opened its first outlet in Ireland on Dublin’s O’Connell Street in February of last year\nThe operator of Karen’s Diner in Dublin - where as part of the concept staff are supposed to be obnoxious to customers - has been ordered to pay over €1,000 in compensation to an ex-worker in a row over unpaid tips.\nKaren’s Diner only opened its first outlet in Ireland on Dublin’s O’Connell Street in February of last year and the themed restaurant centres on purposely offensive staff.\nIt comes from the use of the name ‘Karen’ as shorthand for the stereotype of an entitled, middle-aged, white woman who prides herself on asking to speak to the manager.\nThe international chain only opened in Australia in 2021 and quickly became a TikTok sensation.\nMaria Wilkinson started working at Karen's Diner here last year and after finishing up on April 19, 2024, she lodged a complaint with the Workplace Relations Commissions (WRC) over unpaid tips in October.\nMs Wilkinson told the WRC at a hearing on March 5 that when she started to work at Karen’s Diner she was told that she and her colleagues would be paid the service charge received from the customers, to be divided between all employees.\nHowever, she stated that at no stage did she ever receive any share of the service charge. At first, she understood it would be nearly €2,000 each and then it changed to nearly €1,000 so she was not sure how much exactly is owed.\nNo one from her employer, Dining Experience Ltd trading as Karen’s Diner, appeared at the WRC hearing to rebut Ms Wilkinson’s allegations over the unpaid tips.\nIn his findings, WRC adjudicator Pat Brady ordered Dining Experience Ltd to pay Ms Wilkinson four weeks’ wages, or €1,018.40, for the breach of the Payment of Wages Act concerning the unpaid tips.\nIn his findings, Mr Brady stated that he was satisfied that there was an agreement between Dining Experience Ltd and Ms Wilkinson, and her colleagues, that tips would be distributed, and this was clearly not honoured.\nHe said that while it is not clear what became of any tips collected by the employer, Section 4B (2) of the Act makes it clear that an employer “may not retain any share of tips or gratuities received” subject to a number of exceptions.\nMr Brady stated that it was clear from Ms Wilkinson's evidence that significant tips were being generated as she was told that she might expect payments initially around €2,000 and later around €1,000.\nHe said: “Whatever became of the tips is not clear except to the extent that neither the complainant nor her co-workers received any of them.”\nMr Brady stated that Ms Wilkinson was paid €12.73 per hour for a 20-hour week, or €254.60 per week.\nHe said: “For the breach of her rights under the Act, I award her four weeks wages in the amount of €1018.40.”\nMr Brady pointed out that from December 1, 2022, the Payment of Wages (Amendment) (Tips and Gratuities) Act 2022 introduced new rules as to how employers have to share tips, gratuities and service charges generated electronically amongst employees.",
