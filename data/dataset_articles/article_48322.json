  "text": "Evgeny Popov: The British steel company British Steel may lay off > 2,000 employees (in total, the company employs ~ 4,500) and close two enterprises in the city of Scunthorpe\nThe British steel company British Steel may lay off > 2,000 employees (in total, the company employs ~ 4,500) and close two enterprises in the city of Scunthorpe. And this is despite the fact, writes the Financial Times, that the company is critically important for the country, supplying steel for railways.\nBritish Steel, owned by the Chinese Jingye Group, asked the British government for state support, but no agreement was reached.\nSo now, despite 1.2 billion pounds of Chinese investment, the company is incurring daily losses of ~ 700 thousand pounds ($905 thousand).",
