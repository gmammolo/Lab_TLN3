  "text": "Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf of Kano State has praised the Kano State Police Command for what he described as significant progress in curbing thuggery and other violent crimes across the state, citing recent swift police action as evidence of renewed security effectiveness.\nThe governor gave the commendation on Wednesday, while paying a courtesy visit to the Police Command Headquarters in Bompai, where he met with the Commissioner of Police, CP Ibrahim Adamu Bakori. He expressed particular satisfaction with the rapid arrest of suspects linked to the killing of a housewife and her six children, describing the response as timely and professional.\nGovernor Yusuf said he was impressed that the suspects were apprehended within six hours, far earlier than the 12-hour window he had initially urged, noting that such efficiency had restored public confidence in law enforcement.\nAccording to the governor, security has remained one of the most pressing challenges since he assumed office in 2023, especially incidents of thuggery, kidnapping and banditry. He revealed that sustained police operations under the current leadership have led to an estimated 70 per cent reduction in thuggery across the state.\n“Kano, as the most populous state in Nigeria, must remain peaceful for everyone,” the governor said, stressing that political differences should never undermine collective efforts to maintain security.\nRead also: Kano on edge as bakery arson raises concern over escalating urban killings\nGovernor Yusuf also disclosed that he had briefed President Bola Ahmed Tinubu on the police’s handling of recent criminal cases, adding that the President expressed satisfaction with the performance of the Kano Command. He assured the police of increased logistical and moral support from the state government to further consolidate the gains recorded so far.\nThe visit, which marked Governor Yusuf’s first official trip to the command since his inauguration, was attended by the Speaker of the State House of Assembly, commissioners and special advisers, underscoring what he described as a renewed commitment to cooperation between the state government and security agencies.\nIn his response, Ibrahim Adamu Bakori, Kano State Commissioner of Police, thanked the governor for the visit, describing it as a morale booster for officers and men of the command. He attributed recent successes to strong collaboration with the state government and the effectiveness of community policing, which he said has improved intelligence gathering.\nThe police commissioner reaffirmed the command’s commitment to sustaining the momentum in crime prevention and maintaining peace and stability across Kano State.\nJoin BusinessDay whatsapp Channel, to stay up to date\nOpen In Whatsapp",
