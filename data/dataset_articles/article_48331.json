  "text": "The planned changes involve the elimination of 10,000 full-time positions across various departments responsible for critical functions such as disease outbreak response, insurance provision for low-income Americans, and drug approval, according to the story published Thursday morning, March 27.\nIf enacted, these measures would result in the department losing nearly one-quarter of its personnel, reducing the total workforce to approximately 62,000 federal health workers, the report said, noting that the department will close five of its 10 regional offices.\nClick here to read the complete Wall Street Journal report.\n[Click here]\nto follow Daily Voice\nBethlehem\nand receive free news updates.",
