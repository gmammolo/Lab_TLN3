  "text": "Reducing the annual salary increase for bus drivers from 5% to 3% is among measures Superintendent Cynthia McCabe has proposed to balance the school system’s budget for next year. However, Carroll County School Bus Contractors Association President Dianne Grote said the move will make recruiting and retaining drivers more difficult.\n“It would be discouraging to the school bus drivers who work very hard, and we still have a shortage of drivers in Carroll County, as well as everywhere across the country,” Grote said.\nThe county school board approved a fiscal 2026 budget plan for the school system on Feb. 18 that asks the county to increase education funding by $57 million , including $13 million to continue funding initiatives that would otherwise be eliminated and $44 million to negate some of the effects of state mandates.\nSchool officials determined they could reduce the annual bus contractor salary increases from 5% to 3% after learning through discussions with contractors held years ago that 3% is the minimum contractors need for their businesses to remain viable, Assistant Superintendent of Operations Jon O’Neal said.\n“I think we’re gonna have a hard time attracting our drivers if we don’t give them the 5% that we had talked about,” Board of Education Vice President Steve Whisler said. “It’s a very stressful issue with our contractors.”\nSchool system transportation director Michael Hardesty said in an email that many of the system’s 38 school bus contractors need drivers — though daily routes are adequately covered.\nThe district compensates contractors at a uniform hourly rate of $23.67 per bus. A 5% increase would raise the rate of compensation to $24.85 next school year, according to Hardesty, or around $24.38 with a 3% raise.\n“Bus drivers are employees of their respective school bus contractor with hourly wages determined by agreement between the contractor and their employee-driver,” Hardesty said in an email.\nContractors currently employ 372 drivers, though many are part-time drivers classified as substitutes, who only work certain shifts on weekdays. Of the system’s 304 busses, 243 fulfill daily routes, with the rest servicing field trips and athletic events, and serving as spares as needed.\nThe district’s transportation spending increased by $400,000 in fiscal 2025 , and increased by $2.1 million in the fiscal 2024 budget . Increases to transportation spending have included transportation-related inflationary effects, school system officials have said.\nInflation and lower-than-expected state aid were key factors in creating a budgetary funding gap, McCabe said, which an additional $13 million in county funding would close.\nCarroll is in a particularly bad position to navigate budgetary challenges because the system made more than $40 million in reductions from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2019 , McCabe said.\nMcCabe will host a community town hall meeting to address the budget at 6 p.m. on April 2 at the Carroll County Career and Technology Center, 1229 Washington Road, Westminster.\nThe school system’s proposed fiscal 2026 operating budget and associated funding request were submitted to the county on Feb. 28. The school board might hold another operating budget work session on May 7, before final approval on May 14. Fiscal 2026 begins July 1.\nHave a news tip?
