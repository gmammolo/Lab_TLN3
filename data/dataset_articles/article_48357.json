  "text": "Sky is set to cut some 2,000 jobs — around seven per cent of its workforce — with an overhaul of its traditional call centre roles.\nSky UK will close three of its 10 customer service sites — in Stockport, Sheffield and Leeds — and scale back two others in a move that will cut costs in a labour-intensive division for the group.\nSky, acquired by Comcast in 2018, said that the new strategy was a response to customer demand, with greater numbers wanting round the clock services and rapid answers to basic questions online.\nThe company expects the number of calls taken by its customer services centres to drop from 25 million a year now to around 17 million by 2029.\nSky will invest further in digital services, including in its Sky app, text-based chat and other online help. Technology will aim to proactively diagnose, fix, and update customers on issues before they might occur.\nA Sky spokesperson said: “We’re transforming our business to a deliver quicker, simpler, and more digital customer service. Our customers increasingly want choice, to speak to us on the phone when they need us most and the ease of managing everyday tasks digitally. We’re investing in a new centre of excellence for customer service, alongside cutting-edge digital technology to make our service seamless, reliable, and available 24/7. This is about building a future-ready Sky that continues to put our customers and their needs first.”",
