  "text": "JAY CO. – Conservation Officer Rhett Braun, who serves Jay County, has been selected as the 2025 District 4 Officer of the Year.\n“Across Indiana, conservation officers are on the front lines promoting public safety in the outdoors and protecting our state’s vital natural resources,” said Governor Mike Braun. “I congratulate the officers from each of the 10 districts who have earned this distinguished honor for their exceptional service on behalf of Hoosiers in 2025.”\nOfficer Braun has served as a conservation officer for 10 years. He has served in Jay County since 2015.\nIn addition to his normal duties as a field officer, Officer Braun serves as a field training officer, background investigator, and sonar operator for the Department of Natural Resources Division of Law Enforcement.\nDistrict 4 includes Blackford, Delaware, Grant, Hamilton, Henry, Howard, Jay, Madison, Randolph, Tipton, and Wayne counties.\nThe district award puts Officer Braun in the running for the Pitzer Award, which is presented to the top overall conservation officer in the state and is selected from the 10 district winners.\nThe Pitzer Award is named after Conservation Officer James D. Pitzer, who was fatally shot while investigating illegal hunting activity on Jan. 2, 1961, in Jay County.",
