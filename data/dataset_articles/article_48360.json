  "text": "School strikers on the picket line in Hackney, east London\nA fight over work conditions is unfolding at All Saints Catholic High School in Hackney, east London.\nNEU union members struck on Thursday and are set to strike on Friday because bosses are demanding they cover for other teachers.\nUnder national terms and conditions, this should only happen in “unforeseeable circumstances”. “But now management is getting teachers to cover in circumstances that were totally foreseeable,” NEU joint branch secretary Dave Davies told Socialist Worker.\n“And management has been asking teaching assistants and support workers to cover teachers instead.”\nHe added that “management has refused to make any substantial changes”. It made an offer on cover, but workers rejected it as it simply shifted the burden on support workers.\nOne NEU member told Socialist Worker management has been “unfair” and workers feel that they are “not being listened to”. She said that negotiations haven’t gone anywhere and management has spoken rudely to the strikers.\nManagement has treated the NEU rep “with a lack of respect,” she added. “Before that it was just a workplace disagreement, but after that I am angry.”\nElizabeth, who works at the school, argued that management is making these decisions as cost-saving measures after “government underfunding for years”. “And it isn’t a secret that we have a falling number of student enrolments .”\nWith the current funding formula, central government money is allocated to schools according to the number of students they have. But the housing crisis is pushing working class people out of inner London boroughs.\nElizabeth argued that Labour “need to fund schools properly so we don’t have to end up doing double role”. “We have been bled dry for so many years,” she said.\nWe are working harder but our pay doesn’t reflect that. While bankers get huge bonuses, we don’t get any extra payments.\nElizabeth is a single mum of two girls and has been forced to use bank loans to pay her bills. She argued that the cost of living crisis has added to the difficulties schools are having at retaining teachers.\n“We are working harder but our pay doesn’t reflect that. While bankers get huge bonuses, we don’t get any extra payments.\n“All of the Saturday work I do, I don’t get paid for that. If the money doesn’t allow us to meet our basic needs, then it is no surprise that teachers are leaving the profession.\n“When is that going to change? It is about time the government puts schools first.”\nAnother striker said that they were on the picket line to support their co-workers. “It was a majority decision and I abide by that as a union member,” he said.\nHe thought that the way the headteacher has implemented policies “is completely wrong”. “He has used a sledge hammer instead of a silk glove,” the striker said. “No management can run anywhere without the good will of its workers. All goodwill is gone.”\nYou have young teachers who can’t afford to stay in teaching.\nOne NEU member said the higher workload would harm “the welfare of students and workers” and said they were “disappointed and frustrated with management.”\nOn the picket line, strikers discussed the NEU’s national indicative ballot for industrial action over Labour’s 2.8 pay insult.\nOne person said Britain is “broken” and there being no money left to give to anyone anyway, while another argued the money is there but in the wrong hands.\nAnother striker said, “There’s a disparity of pay structures, for example headteachers being paid £100,000 or £150,000 plus.\n“You have young teachers who can’t afford to stay in teaching.” The strikers pointed out that some “headteachers get paid more than prime ministers”.\nThe strike in Hackney is part of a wave of school walkouts that began last month. They have shown how action builds workers’ confidence to fight—and can build momentum for national action too.",
