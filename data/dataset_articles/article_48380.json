  "text": "Excelsior Correspondent\nJAMMU, Mar 26: Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) today alleged that Government is just passing time by constituting fresh committee for looking into the affairs of daily wagers who are protesting in support of their regularization demand.\nIn a press conference here today the leaders of BMS said the daily wagers are discharging their duties even in place of permanent employees at meagre wages of Rs 9300 per month which have been fixed by Government for un-skilled laborers.\nThe BMS leaders said that these daily wagers work equivalent to regular employees who are getting over six fold salaries than what these hapless workers are being paid.\nBMS alleged that forming committees are just an eye wash as in the past also number of committees had been formed and their reports are lying in the dust bin. BMS demanded that Government should bring a White Paper on the points raised by the MLA, Sham Lal Sharma so that discrimination with Jammu province must be brought in public domain.\nThey also demanded that till the so called fresh committee report is published, SRO 520 be implemented henceforth and pending wages of daily wagers be also released immediately. BMS also had brought in to the notice of Home Minister and Finance Minister, Government of India the grievances of daily wagers but UT Government has also not put up the issue of daily wagers with Central Government seriously, they alleged .\nBMS leaders also strongly condemned Lathi Charge on the poor daily wagers. They alleged that salaries and perks of MLAs and Ex MLAs are revised just in days and for them there is no problem of funds and on the other hand for daily wagers, Government is showing no seriousness.\nThe press conference was conducted by Harbans Choudhary senior BMS leader and Ashok Choudhary, State organizing secretary of the organization. It was also attended by Subash Chander, Chuni Lal and others.",
