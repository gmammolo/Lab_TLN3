  "text": "The SK Innovation battery plant in Iváncsa, Hungary, is reportedly undertaking a recruitment drive targeting Russian and Ukrainian speakers, following significant layoffs that primarily impacted Hungarian workers. According to multiple sources, labour agencies are actively posting advertisements in Russian and Ukrainian Facebook groups, seeking candidates for operator and translator positions with a net salary of HUF 400,000-600,000 (approximately 1,000-1,500 EUR).\nBackground of layoffs and production decline This recruitment drive comes after a period of significant workforce reduction at SK Innovation’s Hungarian operations, Telex reports . In May of last year, the South Korean company, which operates battery plants in both Komárom and Iváncsa, let go of 600 external workers, primarily Kyrgyz, due to declining orders. Subsequently, over 500 internal employees, mostly Hungarian, were also laid off, largely through mutual agreement, though some were terminated.\nAccording to the Hungarian news portal, Hungary’s battery production peaked in October 2023, but has since steadily declined, falling to less than half of that peak by January of this year. This downturn led to workforce reductions at both Samsung in Göd and SK Innovation, with rumours circulating in recent months about the potential closure of one of SK Innovation’s Komárom plants.\nThe Komárom plant.

Sources indicate that SK Innovation has decided to ramp up production in Hungary. There are reports of a substantial new order, with some suggesting that multiple customers placed significantly larger orders than before within a short timeframe.\nIn the past week, numerous job postings from labour agencies seeking workers for Iváncsa have appeared. While some companies have posted advertisements in Hungarian on their websites, the recruitment campaign is primarily focused on Russian and Ukrainian-speaking communities on Facebook.\nSalaries and shifts The advertisements, posted in various open and closed Facebook groups, offer slightly different net monthly salaries, ranging from HUF 380,000 to 600,000 (approx. EUR 950 to 1,500), for 12-hour shifts in alternating day and night shifts. Companies like Enterworks and Elita Work are actively promoting these Russian-language job postings, with Enterworks also featuring the ads in Ukrainian and Hungarian on its website. Additionally, MTSC Hungary, a company with Korean ties, is also recruiting on Profession.hu.\nSeveral Russian-language job postings indicate that the company is also rehiring workers previously laid off due to capacity reductions. One source claims that 100-150 of the over 500 contract workers laid off last May have already been re-employed in Iváncsa. Interestingly, SK Innovation itself is not directly advertising these positions. Their website only lists openings for PLC technicians in Iváncsa, suggesting that the company intends to fulfill the new orders entirely with external workers.\nRead also:",
