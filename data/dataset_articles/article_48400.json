  "text": "Trending Story\nUpdated 05:32 PM UTC, Thu March 27, 2025\nHHS to Cut 10,000 Jobs in Major Restructuring\nUS Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Thursday announced plans to cut a quarter of his department's workforce as part of a sweeping restructuring, framed as a push to prioritize chronic disease prevention under his \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda. The restructuring plan would consolidate the current 28 divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services into 15, including a new entity called the Administration for a Healthy America (AHA).\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\"We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.\"\nComments\nDean Woodard\nI have noticed that they are willing to cut and reduce the work force, but heaven forbid they touch there own wages and benfits\n1452\nLori Friedmann\nSo much for bringing the economy back so much for stimulating the job market so much for raising the stock market so much for lowering the price of groceries, so much for thinking about theWorking man ….. not much different than the first time in office\n634\nHeather F\nStill intrigued to see what they end up reporting the unemployment rate as. I bet somehow it'll be magically low.\n414\nNaomi Ruehlman\n10.7 MILLION every time Rump golfs at Mar-a-Sluggo. BTW, he charges the government for the expensive rooms for Secret Service and MAKES $$$ while the taxpayers foot the bill for nearly EVERY weekend at his roach motel 🏨. 😡\n256\nCotati54\nSo, this is going to help US citizens how?\n95\nHOT COMMENT\nJon Rhodes\nTrump and his cronies know that taxing the rich would be the sensible prudent action to take but they won't do itSo it's going to be the same tired old tune, make the middle class pick up the tab.\n12\nJulie Herrick\ntax the rich\n11\nPat Bergeron\nmaga moronics 2.0\n10\nj\nSingle handed causing unemployment catastrophe. It’s only been a few months. We are so sunk for the next 3 plus years\n8\nMAGA love to pick fruit\nWho cares about sick people? We have a real opportunity to use that extra money for struggling Billionaires and Corporations in the form of massive tax cuts! Making Billionaires Greater! After all that’s what you voted for!🤡🐑🤮\n6\nDanette Aberle\nCulling??\n3\nEl Be\nMake sure to let go of the personnel and labs testing on domestic animals. Let those Beagles be free, stop the abuse of white coats. We already know how much money was wasted on those researches to create weapons not protect public. HHS has become apathetic to the welfare of our nation as a whole.\n3\ngrizzlygambler\ngood idea with measles comeback I guess that's one way to thin the unwashed masses\n2\nShelisa Nichols\nThis is what happens when you let racism be the determining factor in how you choose to vote!\n1\nMarcia Unruh\nthis guy's killing Americans and no one cares\n1\nAKMD\nGood.
