  "text": "College staff start dispute over lack of pay offer\nA trade union has launched a formal dispute with a college after it failed to table a pay offer for its members.\nThe University and College Union (UCU) said if Kendal College, in the Lake District, failed to resolve the dispute it could lead to its members being balloted for strike action.\nGeneral secretary Jo Grady said the college was one of the lowest paying in the region and making staff wait six months for a pay offer was \"unacceptable\".\nThe school's principal Kelvin Nash said the delay was caused by \"additional economic variables\", such as the increase in national minimum wage, which needed to be considered.\n\"Whilst our formal pay offer to the unions has been delayed this year, that delay was through discussion and agreement with the unions, including UCU,\" he said.\nMr Nash said a pay offer for 2024-25 was \"already on the table for consideration by UCU and Unison\".\nHowever, a spokesperson for UCU said the offer still needed to be approved by the college's governors.\nThe union said it was the lowest paying college in Cumbria, with lecturers at the top of the pay scale receiving £36,198 per year.\nIt said its nearest competitor, Furness College, pays £43,665.\nMr Nash said pay offers had always been greater than the Association of College (AoC) pay recommendation and over the past three years the average wage increase for staff was 4.3% per year.\n\"In order for this dispute to be resolved we call on the college to table a sensible offer which can be put to our members,\" Ms Grady said.\n\"If there is a continued unwillingness to do this, we will escalate the dispute.\"",
