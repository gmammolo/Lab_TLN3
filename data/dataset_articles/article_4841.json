  "text": "National law firm Husch Blackwell is pleased to announce that senior counsel Alyssa Samuel has been named to Food & Drug Law Institute’s (FDLI) Cannabis-Derived Products Task Force.\nThe Cannabis-Derived Products Task Force supports FDLI staff in developing programming, which includes cannabis-specific events that may occur throughout the year in the form of a webinar, half-day program, or conference, and cannabis-focused content for events covering broader product areas.\nSamuel advises clients on corporate structure, fundraising, mergers and acquisitions, and regulatory matters in the cannabis, hemp, emerging technology, food and beverage, and hospitality sectors. Her extensive regulatory experience in alcohol, cannabis and consumable hemp enables her to structure transactions that account for licensing requirements, safety issues and other industry-specific concerns.\nSamuel’s term on the task force end in December 2026.",
