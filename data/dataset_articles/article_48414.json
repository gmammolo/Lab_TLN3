  "text": "trading volumesfollowing a regulatory crackdown on F&O trading, is likely to hit\nsalary incrementsand bonuses in the broking industry after a strong two-year run, according to market participants.\nOngoing uncertainty and expectations of continued market volatility amid warnings of the new US administration’s higher tariffs are adding to the strain, prompting brokerage firms to adopt a cautious approach towards expenses.\nAverage increments at brokerages are likely to be down by at least 1.5-2 percentage points from 11% last year, according to a dipstick survey of 12 such firms by Deloitte; some brokerages expect the hit to be harder at even 5-7 percentage points in some instances.\nFY24 was a record one in terms of payouts, with average increments coming in at anywhere between 11% and 15%, according to industry players. But now, many firms, already grappling with multiple regulatory changes that have eroded their margins in recent months, are focusing on cost-cutting measures to navigate the challenging environment.\n“This is a high-risk, high-reward business. In 2025, brokerages are bracing for the fact that the next two quarters may not be great; retail investors will be wary,” said Zarina Sani, associate director, Deloitte Consulting.\nShe added that most companies are unlikely to use up the entire amount they had budgeted for bonuses. “It’s likely to be more in the range of 85-90%.” Top performers, however, will continue to get a premium—bigger bonuses and about 1.7-2x of the average in terms of increments.\nIn a good year, employees stand to get bonuses of three-six months depending on performance; that is likely to come down to two to four months. “This correction is being seen after a good two years,” said Sani.\nIndustry sources said that attrition across industry too has gone down, meaning that firms no longer need to pay out disproportionate hikes to ring-fence talent. “Attrition is not a big concern; it has plateaued,” said a top executive at a full-service brokerage.\n“In line with the expected industry salary increments, our hikes are expected to be around 8-10%, marginally lower than last year,” said Dhiraj Relli, MD & CEO,\nHDFC Securities. “However, there will be performance-based differentiation. In addition to salary increments, bonuses are expected to be around 20 to 30%.”\nAccording to Geetha Menon, head of HR for\nIIFL Capitaland discount stockbroking company\n5paisa Capital, FY25 has been a challenging year because of market volatility, which will impact the increment percentages.\n“The predicted industry average from multiple sources is in the range of 8%-10% compared to 15% on an average in the previous year,” said Menon.\nThis year the wealth management segment across the industry has been on a higher trajectory and will reap the benefits of it, she added.\nThough the first half (April-September) of FY25 was relatively strong, the December quarter results of most leading broking firms present a challenging picture, showing a decline in both revenues and profits compared to the previous quarter. According to the brokers, the March quarter is expected to be even weaker than the December quarter.\nDiscount brokers are likely to be more affected than their full-service counterparts, said industry sources, and this will reflect in hikes as well.\nThe stockbroking industry’s net profit margin is projected to decline by 400 basis points in FY25 due to several regulatory changes introduced in recent months, according to ratings agency CareEdge. In the first half of FY25, industry revenues stood at about Rs 23,500 crore but are expected to decline to around Rs 20,500 crore in the second half. As a result, profit margins are likely to contract from 36% in FY24 to 32% in FY25, according to CareEdge estimates.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the [ET ePaper](https://epaper.indiatimes.com/timesepaper/publication-the-economic-times,city-delhi.cms) online.",
