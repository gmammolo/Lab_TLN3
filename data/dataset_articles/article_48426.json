  "text": "1 2 3 Kochi: While opposition fronts UDF and NDA try to use ASHA workers' demand for an increased honorarium as a political tool by declaring a hike in respective local bodies, the move could head nowhere as civic bodies require govt's final approval to allocate funds and disburse the sum.\nBJP-ruled Mutholy panchayat in Kottayam has decided to provide an additional Rs 7,000 as honorarium. There are 13 ASHAs in the panchayat and each worker will get Rs 84,000 per year from the panchayat's fund. The budget has earmarked Rs 12 lakh for this. Panchayat president Ranjeeth G said ASHAs risked their lives and worked round-the-clock during Covid. \"They are finding it hard to survive with the daily honorarium of Rs 232 they are getting which made us think about providing the additional amount,\" he said. In the 13-member panchayat committee, six are from the BJP.\nUDF-ruled Maradu and Perumbavoor municipalities in Ernakulam have announced an increase of Rs 2,000 per month each in honorarium. In Pathanamthitta, UDF-ruled Vechoochira (15 ASHAs) and Konni panchayat (19 ASHAs) also decided to provide an additional income of Rs 2,000 each. Their budgets earmarked Rs 5 lakh and Rs 3.8 lakh, respectively, for it. In UDF-ruled Kottayam municipality too, the proposal is to provide a monthly incentive of Rs 2,000.\nUDF-ruled Kannur corporation too has announced a special monthly incentive of Rs 2,000 for the 126 ASHAs, deputy mayor P Indira said during its budget presentation on Thursday. There are total 126 ASHAs there and the corporation wants to earmark over Rs 30 lakh to meet the expense yearly.\nASHAs have been protesting in front of the Secretariat for the past 46 days seeking an increase in the honorarium and Rs 5 lakh as retirement benefits. The LDF govt has been insisting that it could raise the honorarium only if Centre increases the incentive.\nMaradu municipality chairman Antony Ashanparambil said the decision of local bodies to give additional amount as honorarium is aimed at pressurising the govt to address ASHAs' demand.\n\"State govt's permission is mandatory for utilising funds to disburse additional honorarium amounts. Govt cannot deny permission to utilise the fund in the backdrop of the ongoing protest,\" he said. The municipality has 33 ASHAs.\nA senior official with the local self-govt department (LSGD) said civic bodies must obtain district planning committee's approval and LSGD's clearance for utilising any fund allocated in the budget.\n\"The opposition-ruled local bodies politically motivated move to allocate additional fund for honorarium may backfire. If govt insists local bodies to utilise their own fund for the whole amount of honorarium, it will affect many local bodies. The ongoing announcements are only political gimmicks. It is unlikely to benefit ASHAs,\" said the official.\nStay updated with the latest city news , Air Quality Index (AQI), and weather updates for major cities like Delhi , Mumbai , Noida , and Bangalore on Times of India .\nEnd of Article FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Tired of too many ads? go ad free now Trending Stories In City Entire Website Tired of too many ads? go ad free now",
