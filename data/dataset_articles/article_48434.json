  "text": "About 2,000 jobs will be cut at Sky as it replaces more of its customer call centre positions with online and artificial intelligence.\nThree of Sky’s UK call centres, in Stockport, Sheffield and Leeds, will be closed and another two, in Newcastle and Dumfries, will be cut back. The move could reduce its workforce by about 7 per cent.\nStaff were informed of the changes, which will be subject to consultation, on Thursday morning.\nIt comes after Sky canvassed 10,000 customers, who said they wanted flexibility in how they contacted the company, with the majority of people preferring digital tools for day-to-day tasks such as paying a bill or managing a contract. Customers will still be able to speak to a person to help resolve",
