We thank staff... and recognise the frustration of residents for which we apologise.\"\nADVERTISEMENT There is a discrepancy between the council and the union over how many staff the restructuring would affect, but the number lies between 70 and 76.\n\"It is regrettable that it has come to [potential redundancies], the council has consistently tried to find a solution to the industrial action,\" the authority said in a statement.\n\"We have made a very fair offer which means that no worker need lose any money. That offer remains open.\"\nHowever, the union said the authority was \"refusing to discuss the issue that we are are in dispute over\".\n\"They have still given no explanation around why there is a so-called equal pay issue, and that's fundamental to this,\" said Onay Kasab, Unite's national lead officer.\nThe strike began earlier this month [BBC] \"Potentially, we are talking about 72 people, but we will make sure that the council does not go ahead with that process,\" he told the BBC.\nADVERTISEMENT \"They have said that nobody will lose any money out of this, and we know now... that people are going to be losing money, not only that, but we know what their attitude is.\"\nMr Kasab added that if staff are made redundant it would mean the dispute would be extended.\nRats on streets In its statement, the city council said all staff had been offered alternative employment at the same pay, and almost three-quarters of staff had taken the offer or taken voluntary redundancy.\n\"There are now 41 workers who have declined any offer, and 35 workers who opted for valuable and skilled driver training, who have also told us via a letter from Unite that they are working under protest,\" it said.\nThe negotiations are due to begin again on Monday.\nThe industrial action has now been going on for the best part of three months, and images of rubbish piling up on the streets of Birmingham have been seen around the world.\nADVERTISEMENT Residents have complained about bad smells, and there have been reports of rats in the streets, as piles of bin bags continue to grow.\nCouncillor Majid Mahmood said the council was willing to work \"around the clock\" to bring the strikes to an end [BBC] Councillor Majid Mahmood, who this week resigned from Unite after the union failed to condemn reported violence on picket lines , said the bin collection service was in need of modernisation.\n\"I share the frustration of residents. I understand they're fed up,\" he said. \"I'm a born and bred Brummie.\n\"I have not had a collection for a fortnight myself, but we have put contingencies in place to try to support residents during this industrial action.\n\"We've extended the hours of the household recycling centres so they can book a slot online and attend the centre to dispose of waste.\"\n\"My message is to Unite - please work with us. We're willing to work around the clock to resolve this.\"\nADVERTISEMENT Follow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds , Facebook , X and Instagram .\nMore on this story Related internet links",
