  "text": "Nurses Fight to Organize, Call Out UnityPoint for Aggressive Union Busting\nDES MOINES, Iowa, March 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- On Thursday, March 27, nurses at UnityPoint Health will hold a press conference outside the Iowa Methodist Medical Center to demand that their employer stop interfering with their right to unionize. For five months, UnityPoint nurses have been working tirelessly to organize with Teamsters Local 90 and their efforts have been met with blatant retaliation from their employer who has spent more than $1.8 million on more than nine outside anti-union labor consultants.\nDespite UnityPoint's senior leadership prioritizing operational efficiency and performance scores over staff retention, nurses are fighting for quality care and safer staffing conditions.\nTo date, Local 90 has filed four unfair labor practice charges against UnityPoint for retaliation, intimidation and interrogation, illegal overbroad work rules, and denied access to union officials.\nWHEN: | Thursday, March 27 |\nWHO: | UnityPoint nurses, members and leaders from Local 90 |\nWHERE: | Iowa Methodist Medical Center Sign (Center Street) |\nMedia Contact:\nColin McCullough, (856) 625-6856\nOn-site Contact:\nRaul Alfaro, (202) 271-5599\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/today-unitypoint-nurses-demand-employer-recognize-their-right-to-join-teamsters-302413444.html\nSOURCE Teamsters Local 90",
