  "text": "Jobs under threat at M&S in Ireland in company restructuring\nManagement at retailer Marks & Spencer will hold talks with union representatives next week amid fears for the jobs of up to 130 staff at its Republic of Ireland stores.\nMiddle management staff at the Irish stores of M&S could face redundancy as the company undertakes a restructuring of its operations in the State. M&S has 16 stores in the Republic.\n“As we continue to invest in and transform our business in Ireland, we need a store management structure that is fully focused on driving a high-performance culture so we are consulting with our colleagues on some proposed changes that we believe will help our stores operate more effectively for our colleagues and our customers,\" the company said in a statement.\nStaff at the company's Irish stores were informed this week of the proposed changes, which will affect managerial staff including store team managers. A company spokesperson said no timeframe was available for the restructuring.\nIt is believed M&S management want to bring in new conditions for staff which would end existing contracts, affecting agreed working hours, rosters, and shift premiums. One member of staff who will be affected by the restructuring described the new roles as \"watered down\" versions of the existing middle management positions. An M&S spokesman said that while around 130 staff were affected by the proposed changes, the company plans to employ 180 staff in new roles in Ireland.\nUnion representatives will meet company management on Tuesday, April 1. A Mandate spokesperson said the union had been informed of company plans for restructuring of its team manager grade. The union represents more than 100 staff who are in these roles. \"The company contacted us yesterday to let us know they had informed staff,\" the Mandate spokesperson said. \"In our position we are always looking to avoid any redundancies in the first instance.\"\nThe retailer's Northern Ireland stores are not expected to be affected by the planned restructuring changes.\nIn its most recent annual accounts, Marks & Spencer in Ireland reported an increase in operating profit to around €33.5m on annual sales of €384m to the end of March 2023. The company has not yet released figures for 2024.\nAlong with its 16 dedicated stores, M&S has separately rolled out franchise outlets in some Applegreen petrol station outlets in Ireland.",
