  "text": "Leaders of the union representing striking Birmingham refuse collectors have said that the union and the workers will not back down as the council looks to impose compulsory redundancy on some striking workers. Industrial action by bin workers has been ongoing for several months, causing much disruption to the city refuse service, with supporters on all out strike since 11th March.\nWith negotiations between Birmingham City Council and Unite unable to progress to a mutually amicable solution, the council has today announced (Thursday 27th March) that it will look at compulsory redundancy for up to 76 workers. The affected workers have refused terms offered to them since the council announced it was axing the WRCO role in a bid to save funds.\nA statement from the council reads: “It is regrettable that it has come to this, the council has consistently tried to find a solution to the industrial action. We have made a very fair offer which means that no worker need lose any money. That offer remains open.\n“We confirm that regrettably we have informed Unite representatives that next week we will formally notify and enter a period of collective consultation regarding compulsory redundancies for those who have declined all offers on the table.”\nHowever, Unite general secretary Sharon Graham remained resolute, saying: “The council’s behaviour is absolutely disgusting. Bully boy tactics are just making this dispute worse – our members will not back down and neither will Unite.”\nThe council statement continues: “This is about securing a better waste service for the people of Birmingham. We thank staff who are working under difficult conditions and recognise the frustration of residents for which we apologise.”\nUnite national lead officer, Onay Kasab, said: “There is no positive spin Unite can put on today’s negotiations.\n“This development will be bitterly disappointing for Birmingham residents but while Unite is prepared to examine all options to resolve the dispute the same commitment does not apply to the council or the government commissioners who have oversight of the city.”\nAn update on the city council’s website says: “Throughout this process we have been very accommodating. Since the start of the industrial dispute, there have been regular and ongoing meetings with Unite officers and shop stewards to seek to resolve the dispute, including two under the auspices of ACAS.\n“We must improve this service and we would ask Unite to work with us as we make these changes for the benefit of the whole city.”\nTalks to negotiate a resolution to current industrial action will resume on Monday (31st March).\nREAD MORE:",
