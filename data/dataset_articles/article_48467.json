  "text": "27th March 2025 – (Hong Kong) Around 30 construction workers staged a protest this morning (27th) at the Grand Mayfair residential project near Yuen Long’s Kam Sheung Road Station, demanding payment for outstanding wages. They displayed banners reading “No sweat, no pay,” “Return my hard-earned money,” “No money for food, no money for rent, tragic!” and “Unethical employers.”\nThe workers claim that at least 30 of them have not received their salaries for the past three months, amounting to approximately HKD 1 million. Despite multiple attempts to recover their wages from the site contractor and subcontractor, their efforts have been unsuccessful, prompting this collective demonstration.\nPolice arrived at the scene after receiving reports, but the atmosphere remained calm.\nThe protesting workers, who have been employed as metal and aluminium workers since January or February last year, reported consistent pay until January of this year, when their salaries ceased. They have been owed three months’ wages and were informed by the subcontractor that payments from the main contractor had not been received, rendering them unable to pay the workers. Following a lack of communication from the main contractor, they decided to protest on-site today.\nMeanwhile, the developer, GRAND AMPLE LIMITED has reached out to the main contractor to inquire about the payment of wages to the subcontractors and has learned that the main contractor has already made payments to the relevant subcontractors. This matter has since been addressed.",
