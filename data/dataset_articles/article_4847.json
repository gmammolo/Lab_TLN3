  "text": "By D.V. Wise No media credit provided. ,\n5 hours ago\nAUGUSTA, Ga. (WJBF) – Around 12:30 Thursday morning, the Richmond County Sheriff’s Office Traffic Division responded to a crash at 2423 Milledgeville Road.\nThe crash involved a vehicle that hit the front of the King Wine and Spirits building.\nAt the same time deputies were being dispatched, Georgia State Patrol Trooper Brandon Crawford arrived on the scene and found the driver unresponsive and not breathing.\nTrooper Crawford immediately administered Narcan and began CPR.\nThe driver regained consciousness and became alert but irritated, which is consistent with symptoms sometimes observed during overdose reversals, authorities say.\nThe driver reportedly sustained minor injuries from the collision due to the impact with the building and the fact that he was not wearing a seatbelt when the airbag deployed.\nHe was taken to the hospital for treatment and is expected to make a full recovery. Medical staff administered an additional dose of Narcan as part of continued care.\nPrior to transport, the driver admitted to having taken Percocet.\nRCSO Chief Lewis Blanchard said, “We are blessed to have many Georgia State Patrol Troopers working within our area and regularly augmenting the Richmond County Sheriff’s Office Traffic Division. Troopers are highly trained professionals who work diligently to help keep drivers in our community safe. Trooper Crawford did a great job today and we are proud of his service within our area.”\nCopyright 2026 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
