  "text": "SCARBOROUGH, Maine — A longtime packaging plant in Scarborough will shut its doors in the coming months, affecting 67 workers who currently report there each day.\nThe facility, known as RTS Packaging, is owned by Sonoco Products Company, which announced the closure amid economic challenges. The plant has been part of the Scarborough community since the 1980s and became part of Sonoco’s portfolio in 1997.\nThe company says the decision stems from economic pressures, including inflation and sluggish sales in the folding carton market.\n\"We understand the impact this closure may have, and are committed to ensuring a smooth transition for the plant, our employees, and other affected parties,\" Interim Head of Investor Relations Roger Schrum said in an email.\nSchrum added that Sonoco plans to provide support and more detailed guidance to employees in the coming weeks. Workers will also have the option to apply for positions at other Sonoco locations across the East Coast, where openings are available.\nOne employee who spoke to NEWS CENTER Maine expressed uncertainty about his future. He said he had hoped to retire from the plant, but now faces a difficult and unexpected transition. He asked to remain anonymous, fearing his severance package could be impacted.\nRELATED: Health and Human Services will lay off 10,000 workers and close agencies in a major restructuring",
