  "text": "Federal workers, veterans protest layoffs\nBROOKLYN — A RALLY ORGANIZED by the American Federation of Government Employees, Locals 862 and 1667, drew a crowd of union members and veterans to the Brooklyn VA Medical Center on Wednesday to protest the planned elimination of 80,000 jobs nationwide at the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nThe rally spotlighted fears that slashing the VA’s workforce would erode care for veterans,\naccording to PIX News 11.\n“If they get rid of 80,000 federal employees from the VA, that’s gonna impact patient care,” said Cheryl Jones, president of AFGE Local 862. “We made a promise to our veterans to take care of them, and we won’t be able to — there won’t be enough staff.”\nProtesters said the layoffs would affect services across other government sectors as well. Speakers called the move “anti-veteran,” “anti-union,” and “plain evil.”\n✰✰✰",
