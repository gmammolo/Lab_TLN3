  "text": "Photos: Faculty demonstrate on ISU Quad ahead of possible strike\nEmily Bollinger,\nA large group of Illinois State University faculty and their supporters gathered on the Quad on Thursday for a demonstration as the campus braces for a potential strike.\nThe United Faculty of ISU union, which represents around 650 tenured and tenure-track faculty members, is trying to negotiate its first contract with the university. The two sides have been negotiating for over a year but haven't been able to reach a deal. The biggest remaining logjams are related to pay, workload and leaves.\nThe union has filed an intent to strike, meaning a work stoppage could begin as soon as April 4.\nAppearing alongside faculty members at Thursday's demonstration were state Sen. Dave Koehler and Rep. Sharon Chung, both Democrats who represent parts of Bloomington-Normal.\nSee photos from the demonstration in the photo gallery above.",
