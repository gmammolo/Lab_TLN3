To read about CWA Members, Leadership or Industries, visit our About page.\nMPP and MERSEN Workers Fight for Fair Contracts in Advanced Materials Industry\nIUE-CWA workers at Metal Power Products (MPP) in Campbellsburg, Ind., and MERSEN in Columbia, Tenn., are fighting for their very first contracts—with resolute support from IUE-CWA Local 88502. The local also represents MPP and MERSEN workers in St. Mary’s, Pa. IUE-CWA Local 88502 President Kelvin Torres stresses that increasing the union’s density within the advanced materials industry builds the strength needed at the bargaining table.\nAt MPP Campbellsburg, negotiations have been slow but steady, and the workers remain united as they continue to push for a fair contract. During February, MPP workers reached out to Congresswoman Erin Houchin with Valentine’s Day postcards, urging her to pressure MPP executives and its owner, Mill Point Capital, for fair treatment. They also conducted a comprehensive survey highlighting health and safety violations and extended their inquiry to union and non-union MPP worksites nationwide. In addition to safety, key issues including wages, benefits, and mutual respect remain high on workers’ list of concerns.\nIn Columbia, Tenn., an overwhelming vote to form a union in October 2024 brought more MERSEN workers under the IUE-CWA umbrella. In retaliation, management imposed furloughs just before the holidays—many of which turned into permanent layoffs. IUE-CWA responded by charging MERSEN with federal labor law violations and exposing their broken promises to the community after receiving state subsidies meant to create good, sustainable jobs. In solidarity, IUE-CWA Local 88502 raised hardship funds to help laid-off members. At the same time, the bargaining committee in Tennessee, after vigorous outreach to the media and local elected officials, secured crucial gains during an effects bargaining, including greatly increased severance pay, healthcare coverage during severance, and full recall rights should the company expand its payroll again in the coming year.\nRegular contract negotiations are slated to begin this month for MERSEN workers in Columbia, and progress is underway at MPP in Campbellsburg. The new members demand respect, safety, and strong wages and benefits to ensure these jobs remain a promising future for their communities.\nIUE-CWA Local 88502 members at Metal Power Products in Campbellsburg, Ind.
