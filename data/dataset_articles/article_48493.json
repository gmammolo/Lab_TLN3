  "text": "There are concerns for the future of 300 jobs at Carelon Global Solutions Ireland which is based at the National Technology Park at Castletroy in Limerick, after the company said tonight it is considering ceasing operations there.\nCarelon, formerly known as Legato Health Technologies, has had a presence in Ireland, based in Limerick, since 2021.\nThe company said its decision to consider its future in Ireland comes after a review of its business operations, and an examination of the changing healthcare landscape globally.\nThe company provides digital integrated solutions for the healthcare industry, and is involved in information technology solutions, data analytics and business process systems.\nIt is understood that a consultation process will begin with employees about a winddown, but it is not clear how long that process will take, or when operations at the company will finally cease.\nCarelon has been in Ireland for the past four years, but also has a presence in India, the Philippines and Puerto Rico. It is part of the larger Elevance Health group which owns a number of health organisations involved in the commercial and medicare areas, including the Anthem Blue cross and Blue Shield company, and the Wellpoint company.\nIn a statement tonight the company said: \"As part of our ongoing review of business operations and given the changing healthcare landscape, Elevance Health is considering ceasing operations of Carelon Global Solutions Ireland Limited.\n\"We understand this news has been difficult for associates, whose achievements and continued dedication and service are fully appreciated, and we are committed to supporting them as we work through this process.\"",
