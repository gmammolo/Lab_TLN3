  "text": "AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler issued the following statement on cuts Elon Musk’s DOGE announced to programs at the Department of Labor:\nThe AFL-CIO is deeply concerned about DOGE’s announcement regarding the elimination of the program funding for the Department of Labor’s Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB). The ILAB plays a critical role in leveling the playing field for workers in the United States and around the world, raising standards and preventing the outsourcing of American jobs and a race to the bottom. These cuts will harm America’s workers by encouraging outsourcing by multinational corporations looking for cheap labor. Empowered workers are essential for strong democracies, so eliminating funding for the ILAB is also a gift to billionaires and dictators around the world who want to stamp out unions and roll back human rights.\nThe ILAB team has deep expertise in carrying out important priorities to all Americans, including ensuring that products that come into our country are made free from child and forced labor. It also works on monitoring and enforcing the effective implementation of our trade agreements. The ILAB programs provide a vital tool for our nation to fight against trafficking, child labor and exploitative cheap labor. The elimination of these grants and possible staff positions undermines the interests of workers in the United States and around the world.\nContact: Steve Smith, 202-637-5018",
