  "text": "CONSHOHOCKEN, P.A. ( KYW Newsradio ) —- Allied Universal, the parent company of Universal Security Services, said in a notice sent to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry that it would be laying off 72 employees from its Conshohocken headquarters between May and September this year. In the notice, Allied said the layoffs would involve support staff that included accountants, analysts, engineers, IT workers and those in the company’s accounting department. The company issued a statement that said in part, “the workforce reduction is a result of a company-wide centralization and standardization of all our business processes.” It also comes after Allied Universal completed six acquisitions in 2024 of various security companies in the U.S., Australia, the Netherlands, and Barbados, which were reported earlier this month. Those companies were reported to have revenues totaling $240 million. Allied employs 770,000 people worldwide and the Universal Protection Service branch is one of the top 30 employers in Pennsylvania. The Conshohocken office is one of two headquarters in the U.S. The other is in California. Late last year, the company also announced layoffs of more than 300 employees at four different locations in California.",
