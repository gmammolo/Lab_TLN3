  "text": "New Delhi: In a relief to Arvind Kejriwal, a Delhi court on Thursday acquitted the former chief minister in two separate cases lodged against him for not appearing before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in pursuance of the summonses asking him to join the probe in the alleged excise policy scam.\nNew Delhi: AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal during a protest rally at Jantar Mantar, in New Delhi. (PTI Photo/Ravi Choudhary)\nObserving that the accused was a serving chief minister and \"he too enjoyed his fundamental right of movement\", a court here held that \"the legal challenge to due service of summons is maintainable\".\nThe court said, \"Neither the service of summons through emails has been proved by the ED nor the process of issuing summons to any person under Section 50(2) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) via email has been proved to be in accordance with the law.\"\n\"Even if, for the sake of argument, these summonses are admitted to be proved, the entire process is antithetical to the rule of law. No such mode of service is envisaged under the PMLA or the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The onus was strict on the ED to prove that it could summon any person under Section 50(2) of the PMLA,\" Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Paras Dalal said.\nThe ED alleged it issued summonses, which were duly served, and yet the then chief minister intentionally omitted to obey the summonses and did not attend the probe.\nIt also alleged Kejriwal raised frivolous objections and deliberately created grounds for not attending the probe.\nThe court underlined procedural, legal and factual challenges to the ED's case regarding Kejriwal's culpability.\nFollowing the verdict, AAP National Convenor Arvind Kejriwal wrote on X, “Satyamev Jayate” (Truth alone triumphs).\nKejriwal has consistently maintained that he respects the law and the Constitution, but that opposing any politically motivated and unconstitutional action is also a democratic right.\nThe Aam Aadmi Party has said that this verdict is a victory for a way of thinking in which the people, not power, come first.\nSenior advocate N Hariharan and Rebecca John appeared for Arvind Kejriwal. Advocate Rajat Bhardwaj had appeared for Amanatullah Khan.\n(With PTI inputs)\nFor the Latest news, India News and breaking stories from around the world, visit Times Now for live coverage and in-depth reporting.",
