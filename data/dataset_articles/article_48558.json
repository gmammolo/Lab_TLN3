  "text": "Crystal Dynamics studio, known for Tomb Raider and Deus Ex, announced About the new round of dismissals. As part of the restructuring of the work of the studio, 17 people remained without work.\n“This morning, Crystal Dynamics made a difficult decision to reduce the staff of 17 talented employees,” the company said in an official statement. Representatives of the studio emphasized that dismissal is not related to the professional qualities of the victims, but are a forced measure to comply with modern business realities.\nThe injured employees were offered support packages and assistance in finding a new job. Despite the changes, Crystal Dynamics assures that it continues to actively work on current projects, including the next part of the Tomb Raider, although there is very little information about it.\nIt is worth noting that these are not the first abbreviations in Crystal Dynamics – in 2023 the studio was already experiencing a similar crisis. Since then, she has not had large releases, which only confirms the difficult situation within the company.",
