  "text": "Infosys has reportedly laid off more trainees at its Mysuru campus. According to a MoneyControl report, the software giant has let go 30-45 employees from the campus on March 26. In February this year, the IT company cut around 400 roles after the trainees failed evaluation tests in three consecutive attempts. Infosys has reportedly sent email to the affected trainees. “Further to the announcement of the results of your final assessment attempt, please be informed that you have not met the qualifying criteria in the 'Foundation skills training program' despite the additional preparation time, doubt-clearing sessions, and several mock assessments opportunities,” Infosys's mail sent to trainees read.\nWhat happens to affected Infosys trainees\nAs per the report, Infosys has offered alternative career paths to the affected trainees that includes a 12-week training for potential roles in Infosys Business Process Management (BPM). In addition, Infosys will sponsor the training for BPM roles.\nFor trainees who choose not to take the BPM pathway, the company will provide transportation from Mysuru to Bangalore along with a standard travel allowance to their hometown. Accommodation at the Employee Care Centre in Mysuru will be available until their departure date if needed.\nTrainees planning to leave the campus have been asked to submit their travel and accommodation preferences by March 27, 2025.\nInfosys tweaks the ‘10-day-work from office’ policy\nEarlier this month, Infosys told its technology workforce to comply with its mandate to work 10 days a month from office, in a bid to get more people back onto the campus. As reported by Economic Times, in an email, functional heads at the Bengaluru-headquartered company informed their teammates to limit the number of work-from-home days that they apply for, effective March 10.\n“To support this, starting March 10, 2025, system interventions will be implemented to limit the number of work-from-home days that can be applied each month. These measures are designed to ensure compliance with the new hybrid work requirements while maintaining flexibility for employees,” said the email, which ET has seen.\n“As you know, our hybrid work model expects employees to work from the office for at least 10 days a month, or as per business requirements, whichever is higher,” the email added.\nAbout the Author TOI Tech Desk The TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.
