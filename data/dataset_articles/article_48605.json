  "text": "BETHLEHEM — Plug Power sent letters to local municipalities this week informing them it plans to lay off 299 Capital Region workers at three local facilities, the Albany Business Review reported. The Business Review said it obtained the letters directly from the towns of Colonie and Clifton Park, where two of Plug Power’s facilities are located. The company had not yet filed a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification with the state Department of Labor as of Thursday. Most large companies are required to provide 90 days' notice of mass layoffs under the New York State WARN Act. Plug Power did not respond to the Times Union’s requests for details earlier this week. Plug Power, which makes hydrogen-powered fuel cells and “green” hydrogen fuel extracted out of water, has never turned a profit. It had to go through layoffs last year as it seeks to stem the billions of dollars in losses it has posted over the years as it seeks to become the largest supplier of green hydrogen in the world and make fuel cells for a variety of commercial uses to power vehicles, data centers and the electrical grid. Plug Power said on March 3 that it would do another restructuring this year that would cut $150 million to $200 million in annual expenses. The plan, called Project Quantum Leap, is designed to get the company closer to profitability. Sign up for Times Union newsletters here Read the original article on timesunion.com",
