  "text": "Dickies, the workwear apparel company with deep roots in Fort Worth, has reported that its total expected job cuts from moving its corporate headquarters to California will be 125 employees, according to state records. Dickies’ parent company, VF Corp. , had said in November that about 120 employees would be impacted. This week, it filed notice with the Texas Workforce Commission on the total number of layoffs by May 30. It is unclear whether some of those positions have already been cut. The layoffs could be the final chapter of the shocking relocation saga for an iconic company that has been synonymous with Fort Worth for decades. City leaders said they were blindsided last fall by news of the move , which may have been spurred by VF Corp.’s recent financial struggles . Officials in Costa Mesa, California, also said they were unaware of Dickies’ plans to move to their city. VF Corp. did not respond to a request for comment on the layoffs. The company plans to keep its Fort Worth distribution center and warehouse open. The fashion conglomerate owns a number of popular brands, including The North Face, Timberland and Vans. Dickies will be moving into Vans’ California headquarters , which opened in 2017. VF Corp.’s stock price has lost nearly 80% of its value over the past four years. The Denver-based company bought Dickies for $820 million in 2017. In early 2024, Dickies moved its headquarters to 500 Taylor St. in downtown, after spending roughly $4.5 million renovating the office . The company’s downtown headquarters had space for up to 220 employees. Only about 140 people were regularly coming into the office in April 2024 when the Star-Telegram visited, though it was not mandatory for employees to work in-office at the time. Dickies still operates a retail store at 509 W. Vickery Blvd., its original Fort Worth campus. Dickies was founded in Fort Worth in 1922 by C.N. Williamson and E.E. “Colonel” Dickie. After World War II, Dickies took the brand international, introducing its work wear line into the European market. In the 1980s, Dickies saw hip-hop artists like N.W.A. adopt its clothing. By the ‘90s, Dickies had infiltrated skateboarding culture as the go-to for durability and comfort. Get TX Politics in your inbox.",
