  "text": "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. vowed to do “more with less” as the agency laid off 10,000 workers and shut down entire agencies, including ones that oversee billions of dollars in funds for addiction services and community health centers across the nation.\nThe Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control will see the most drastic changes and face an expected 20% cut to their agencies.\nThe move is a major restructuring of the nation’s Health Department and falls in line with the Trump administration’s broader efforts to radically downsize the federal government.\nDavid Gonzalez, the District 2 national vice president for the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employees union in the country, joined NY1 political anchor Errol Louis on “Inside City Hall” Thursday to discuss more.\nGonzalez represents federal employees throughout the northeast.\nTap the video player above to watch the interview.",
