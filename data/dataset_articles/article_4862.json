  "text": "North Bend Police celebrate heroic acts and leadership at 2025 annual awards ceremony\nNORTH BEND, Ore. — North Bend Police Chief Cal Mitts recognized five officers during Tuesday’s City Council meeting with the department’s 2025 annual awards, citing actions that ranged from crisis intervention to medical rescues and leadership development.\n“These officers serve this community with an incredible sense of pride, commitment and compassion,” Mitts said.\nSgt. Jake Hult will receive the FBI-LEEDA Leadership Trilogy Award after completing a series of leadership institutes, including the Supervisor Leadership Institute, Command Leadership Institute and Executive Leadership Institute, Mitts said. Hult also oversees the department’s field training program for new officers, according to Mitts.\nSgt. Patrick Kinney will receive a Life Saving Award for actions taken April 28, 2025, after officers were dispatched to the McCullough Bridge for a report of a suicidal person on the railing, Mitts said. Officers made contact with a 43-year-old woman seated on the railing and, after coordinating their approach, Kinney grabbed her and pulled her to safety, Mitts said. The woman was secured without injury and transported to a hospital, he said.\nOfficer Trevor Sanne will receive a Life Saving Award for an Oct. 13, 2024, response at Simpson Park, where he and Officer Coel Stark were sent to investigate a suspicious condition in a women’s restroom, Mitts said. The officers determined the woman on the floor was suffering an overdose and had no pulse, Mitts said. They administered two doses of naloxone, commonly known by the brand name Narcan, and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until North Bend Fire Department personnel arrived and assumed care, he said. The woman regained a pulse and began breathing on her own before being transported to an emergency room, Mitts said, and later made a full recovery.\nStark will receive two Life Saving Awards for his roles in both the April 28, 2025, bridge rescue and the Oct. 13, 2024, overdose response, Mitts said. Stark was out of town on a previously planned trip and was unable to attend the presentation, he said.\nOfficer Ben Martin will be recognized as the department’s 2025 Police Officer of the Year and will also receive the chief’s Medal of Merit, Mitts said. Martin, who joined the department in February 2025, was selected to become the K-9 handler for Athena and took a leading role in fundraising and program development, Mitts said. Community support helped raise more than $60,000 for the K-9 program, he said, alongside the ongoing training required for a K-9 team.\nMitts also highlighted coordination with North Bend Fire & Rescue during emergency responses. “We work very well together,” he said.",
