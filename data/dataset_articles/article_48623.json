  "text": "Having sought to jettison as many Federal workers as possible, the Administration is now going after the labor rights of those who are left. According to The Hill:\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said Thursday that President Trump signed an executive order limiting numerous agency employees from unionizing and instructing the government to stop engaging in any collective bargaining. The OPM memo references an order from Trump that has yet to be publicly posted, but a fact sheet from the White House claims that the Civil Service Reform Act that allows government workers to unionize “enables hostile Federal unions to obstruct agency management.” The order targets agencies it says have a national security mission but many of the departments don’t have a strict national security connection. In addition to all agencies with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, the order also covers the Treasury Department, all agencies with Health and Human Services. That has yet to be publicly posted, but a fact sheet from the White House claims that the Civil Service Reform Act that allows government workers to unionize “enables hostile Federal unions to obstruct agency management.” The order targets agencies it says have a national security mission but many of the departments don’t have a strict national security connection.\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said Thursday that President Trump signed an executive order limiting numerous agency employees from unionizing and instructing the government to stop engaging in any collective bargaining.\nThe OPM memo references an order from Trump that has yet to be publicly posted, but a fact sheet from the White House claims that the Civil Service Reform Act that allows government workers to unionize “enables hostile Federal unions to obstruct agency management.”\nThe order targets agencies it says have a national security mission but many of the departments don’t have a strict national security connection.\nIn addition to all agencies with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, the order also covers the Treasury Department, all agencies with Health and Human Services.

The Administration is going after Veterans, Federal workers, Farmers (via tarrifs), people of color (via elimination of DEI), senior citizens (via attacks on SS and Medicaid) and a host of other categories.\nI cannot conceive that this long list of categories will continue to support MAGA and its connections.",
