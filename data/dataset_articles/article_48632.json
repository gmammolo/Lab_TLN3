  "text": "Industry- 1 min read\nSky says 2,000 UK jobs at risk in call centre shake-up\nThree of its 10 contact centres in northern England are believed to be closing.London: The British-based Sky broadcasting group said on Thursday that 2,000 jobs in the UK, or 7% of its workforce, could be at risk as the company shakes up its customer services.\n\"We're transforming our business to deliver quicker, simpler, and more digital customer service,\" a spokesperson for the US-owned broadcaster told AFP.\nIt was about building \"a future-ready Sky\", the spokesperson said, adding customers wanted different ways of contacting the company 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nThree of its 10 contact centres in northern England are believed to be closing, putting around 2,000 roles at risk.\nSky said its transformation would involve a multi-million-pound investment in its new state-of-the-art campus in Livingston, Scotland.\nFormerly owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch, Sky has been run by US cable giant Comcast since 2018.\nIn addition to the proposed closure of the Stockport, Sheffield and Leeds Central contact centres, operations at Dunfermline and Newcastle would also be affected.",
