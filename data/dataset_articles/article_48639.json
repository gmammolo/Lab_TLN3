  "text": "Retired profs at Punjabi varsity not getting pensionary benefits\nRetired professors at Punjabi University, Patiala, are facing financial distress due to the non-disbursement of their pensions and General Provident Fund (GPF)\nPatiala : Retired professors at Punjabi University, Patiala, are facing financial distress due to the non-disbursement of their pensions and General Provident Fund (GPF).\nMany of them have not received their dues since June of last year and the lack of communication from the university’s registrar’s office has only added to their woes. Several retired professors, including Rajesh Sharma and Rajinder Lehri, have voiced their concerns, with Sharma even writing to the Punjab governor, who is the university’s chancellor, to intervene and resolve the issue.\nSharma, who retired as the head of the English department, emphasised that it has been nine months since his retirement, and he has yet to receive either his pension or GPF. He expressed his distress, stating that retired professors are unable to survive without their rightful financial support.\nLehri echoed similar sentiments, calling it humiliating to run from pillar to post to receive pensions after a lifetime of dedication to the university.\nAnother retired professor Jaswinder Saini from the Punjabi department also criticised the delay and urged the university to release their pensions and GPFs, emphasising that these are funds they are entitled to.\nUniversity authorities confirmed the delay but assured that efforts were underway to resolve the matter.\nPunjabi university registrar Sanjiv Puri said the pension files are under process, citing technical issues and pending clearance from the audit department as the main causes of the delay. He added that standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been implemented to ensure faster processing of pension cases.\nKaramjit Singh, who is currently holding the additional charge of the vice-chancellor, expressed regret over the situation and assured that steps were being taken to expedite the disbursement of pensions. He also mentioned that delays from the audit department of the Punjab government were contributing to the delay.\nAdministrative secretary of higher education and school education department, Punjab, Anindita Mitra could not be contacted for comments despite repeated attempts.",
