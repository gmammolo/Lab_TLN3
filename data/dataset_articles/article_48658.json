  "text": "Trump administration moves to end union rights for many federal workers Rebecca Beitsch Fri, March 28, 2025 at 1:43 AM UTC 4 min read\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said Thursday that President Trump signed an executive order limiting numerous agency employees from unionizing and instructing the government to stop engaging in any collective bargaining.\nThe OPM memo references an order from Trump , but it is an accompanying fact sheet from the White House that lays out the rationale for the movie, claiming that the Civil Service Reform Act allowing government workers to unionize “enables hostile Federal unions to obstruct agency management.”\n“President Trump is taking action to ensure that agencies vital to national security can execute their missions without delay and protect the American people,” the fact sheet states.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement The order targets agencies it says have a national security mission but many of the departments don’t have a strict national security connection.\nIn addition to all agencies with the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of State, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, the order also covers the Treasury Department, all agencies with Health and Human Services (HHS), the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, the General Services Administration, and many more.\nIn total the OPM memo references 18 departments while also including numerous component agencies.\nThe OPM memo instructs agencies to terminate their collective bargaining agreement.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Consequently, those agencies and subdivisions are no longer required to collectively bargain with Federal unions,” OPM states in its memo.\n“Because the statutory authority underlying the original recognition of the relevant unions no longer applies, unions lose their status as the ‘exclusive[ly] recogni[zed]’ labor organizations for employees of the agencies.”\nThe OPM memo also says “agencies should cease participating in grievance procedures after terminating their CBA,” an abbreviation for collective bargaining agreements.\nThe American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), condemned the action in an email to its members, saying the Trump administration was “illegally strip[ping] collective bargaining rights from hundreds of thousands of federal workers.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Let’s be clear. National security is not the reason for this action. This is retaliation because our union is standing up for AFGE members—and a warning to every union: fall in line, or else.\nMore in Politics Trump's move to end an immigration program hits a powerful Republican base of voters NBC News Yale professor who studies fascism fleeing US to work in Canada The Guardian Trump Signs Order To Restore Racist Monuments, Remove 'Anti-America' Ideology HuffPost DHS Official Placed on Leave After Adding Reporter to Sensitive Email Chain The Daily Beast “AFGE is not going anywhere. We are fighting back. We are preparing legal action.”\nThe move to restrict unions comes after DHS stripped the bargaining rights of Transportation Safety Administration employees.\nAFGE has sued over that matter, arguing Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has no power to end an already authorized seven-year contract.\n“The 2024 CBA has a term of seven years and allows limited midterm bargaining. This collective bargaining agreement, like any other, is a binding contract,” the union wrote in the suit.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Civil Service Reform Act, while allowing for collective bargaining, does have exemptions for national security.\nThe OPM memo, however, makes some surprising choices in determining which agencies have a national security mission.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection, which includes Border Patrol, is not included in the memo. It’s union endorsed Trump during the 2024 election, and Trump recently nominated its former leader to serve as ambassador to Chile.\nAlso not included are any agencies that comprise the intelligence community beyond those within the DOD.\nBut the now-dismantled U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is, indicating the administration classifies it as playing a role in national security.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement And the inclusion of HHS comes as the agency announced Thursday that it plans to cut 10,000 jobs in a major restructuring.\nThe OPM memo gives insight into the Trump administration’s next steps for employees after it terminates the agreements.\nOPM directs agencies to shorten the timeline for performance improvement plans (PIP) for federal workers, saying after union agreements are terminated, agencies should not allow more than 30 days for a PIP.\nIt also says without collective bargaining agreements in place, agencies should also return to in person work as quickly as possible.\n“Upon termination of these CBAs, covered agencies and subdivisions should swiftly implement the President’s directives in Return to In-Person Work,” it states.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement It also says the government will no longer collect union dues.\n“Agency employees may make other arrangements for dues payments if they wish to do so,” it states.\nUpdated at 10:25 p.m. EDT.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
