  "text": "By Darrelle Lincoln ,\n48 minutes ago\nBarron Trump, Donald Trump’s youngest and his only child with Melania Trump (Damon Higgins-USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images) Barron Trump, the son of Donald Trump and Melania Trump, is currently in the middle of his sophomore year at New York University. He started at NYU’s Stern School of Business in fall 2024 as a freshman and reportedly studied at NYU’s Washington, D.C., campus for his sophomore year.\nAside from his schooling, it seems that Barron is a hero on the side.\nDonald Trump’s youngest son reportedly told Metropolitan Police officers he is “very close” to an alleged rape victim. Trump contacted police in London last year after witnessing an alleged assault on a female friend. It happened while he and the woman were on a video call, a British court has been told. Barron has made a habit of finding friends online .\nWhat Barron Trump Did After Witnessing A Crime Barron Trump (Chip Somodevilla-Pool via Imagn Images) A transcript of Trump’s emergency call was shown during the trial of Matvei Rumiantsev at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London this week. The 19-year-old contacted the British police force from the US. He witnessed in real time his female friend in London being attacked.\nNow, because of Barron Trump, Matvei Rumiantsev is facing a number of charges, including assault and two counts of rape.\nA transcript of the call, released by the Crown Prosecution Service, records Barron saying: “Oh, I’m calling from the US, uh, I just got a call from a girl, you know, she’s getting beat up.” The conversation continued: “This was happening about eight minutes ago. I just figured out how to, how to call someone.\n“Uh, uh, it’s really an emergency.” Barron also told police he had met the alleged victim through social media. “I don’t think these details matter she’s getting beat up but okay fine, also I met her on social media, I don’t think that matters.”\nIt was also reported that Barron Trump had emailed the Met investigating the allegations. In the email, he explained: “I didn’t expect her to pick up due to the time difference. The phone was picked up.\n“The individual who answered was a shirtless man with darkish hair. This view lasted maybe one second … then the view flipped to the victim.”\nWhen asked if he would provide a witness statement, he reportedly said that what he saw was “very brief indeed but indeed prevalent.”\nRumiantsev is a 22-year-old Russian national and former MMA fighter. His trial is ongoing.\nThe post Barron Trump Praised For Saving British Female’s Life By Calling Police On Her Alleged Rapist After Witnessing Her Abuse During Video Call – Police Transcript Leaked originally published on Total Pro Sports .\n2",
