  "text": "Infosys has once again laid off trainees from its Mysuru campus after they failed internal assessments. This comes just two months after facing criticism for similar terminations. Although the exact number remains unconfirmed, reports estimate that around 30–45 trainees were affected.\nAlternative Options for Trainees\nInfosys offered the terminated trainees a choice to join its Business Process Management (BPM) division. Those who declined the offer were provided with a one-month ex-gratia payment and a relieving letter.\nThe company defended its decision, stating, “All freshers undergo extensive foundational training and are required to clear internal assessments. Trainees are given three attempts to pass. If unsuccessful, they cannot continue with Infosys, as per their contract.”\nPrevious Allegations of Forced Termination\nThe Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) had earlier accused Infosys of forcefully terminating trainees. Following a complaint on February 7, the Karnataka Labour Department investigated the matter. On February 27, the department ruled in favor of Infosys, stating that no labor law violations were found due to the absence of an employer-employee relationship.\nNITES Appeals to the Education Ministry\nUnhappy with the ruling, NITES has now taken the matter to Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Minister Jayant Chaudhary. They alleged that Infosys violated The Apprentices Act, 1961, and The Apprenticeship Rules, 1992.\nAccording to NITES, Infosys recruited trainees under the National Apprenticeship Training Scheme (NATS) in October 2024. Despite being under legally binding apprenticeship contracts, these trainees were terminated without following proper legal procedures.\nInfosys’ Stand on Training and Assessments\nInfosys emphasized its commitment to maintaining high-quality talent. The company clarified that all trainees are aware of the rigorous assessment process upon joining, and the cost of training is fully borne by Infosys. Trainees sign an Apprenticeship Registration Form, acknowledging these terms.\nConclusion\nWhile Infosys stands by its internal assessment policy, the dispute highlights the challenges faced by fresh graduates navigating the corporate world. The involvement of government authorities may bring further clarity on the legal standing of such terminations. Trainees and industry stakeholders now await the Education Ministry’s response on the matter.",
