  "text": "The world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer, BYD, has successfully secured a defamation ruling against a prominent TikTok blogger, Yao Weiqiang, concerning false claims about the fuel consumption of its Denza B5 SUV. The court has ordered Weiqiang to pay compensation of 2.01 million yuan (approximately $290,000) for his statements, which asserted that the Denza B5 consumed 18 liters per 100 kilometers.\nLaunched domestically in October 2023 under the name Fang Cheng Bao Bao 5, the Denza B5 is a body-on-frame SUV that has quickly gained traction, racking up cumulative domestic deliveries of 109,177 units, according to China EV DataTracker. With a starting price of 289,800 yuan (around $41,610), the vehicle has made significant inroads in the competitive electric vehicle market in China.\nThe controversy erupted on November 28, 2023, when Weiqiang posted a video on his Douyin account, which boasts over one million followers. In his video, he claimed that BYD’s plug-in hybrid SUV experienced fuel consumption rates of 18 L/100km under normal driving conditions. In contrast, BYD’s official specifications indicate a significantly lower figure of 1.79 L/100km based on WLTC testing standards in China.\nFurther scrutiny revealed that Weiqiang had engaged in reckless driving during his tests. Investigations found that he frequently exceeded legal speed limits, driving at velocities ranging between 140 and 160 km/h for over 46% of the time, with speeds hitting up to 180 km/h. Additionally, he exhibited behavior characterized by rapid acceleration and deceleration, which is known to adversely affect fuel consumption. Law enforcement determined that his actions posed a danger to road safety, further undermining his claims against the vehicle’s efficiency.\nBYD responded vigorously, asserting that Weiqiang’s allegations harmed the reputation of their product. Initially, the company sought compensation of 5 million yuan (approximately $720,000) and demanded a public apology from the influencer.\nThe initial judgment delivered on January 22 mandated that Weiqiang pay 2.01 million yuan in compensation to BYD. Representing the company, a spokesperson emphasized the importance of regulating information shared on social media platforms. “We always respect and accept suggestions and supervision from all sectors of society, but the internet is not a lawless zone,” the spokesperson stated. BYD has indicated its commitment to tackling misinformation and defending its rights through legal avenues.\nThis ruling aligns with BYD’s ongoing strategy to combat defamation online, as evidenced by previous lawsuits against influencers disseminating false information. In June 2025, the company reportedly took action against 37 bloggers, and a defamation suit led to another ruling favoring BYD for 2 million yuan in December of the previous year. To further bolster its efforts, BYD has established a News Anti-Fraud Office dedicated to tackling misinformation.\nThe Denza B5, which is built on BYD’s DMO platform, presents robust specifications, including dimensions of 4890mm in length, 1970mm in width, and 1920mm in height, with a wheelbase of 2800mm. The vehicle’s versatility is highlighted by a hydraulic suspension system that allows for an impressive ground clearance of up to 310mm. Its powertrain features a 1.5-liter internal combustion engine paired with two electric motors, delivering a total output of 505 kW (650 hp), emphasizing BYD’s commitment to innovative automotive technology.",
