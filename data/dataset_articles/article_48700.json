  "text": "MN state workers push back against return-to-office order\nFriday, March 28, 2025\nLabor groups representing thousands of Minnesota state workers find themselves at serious odds with Gov. Tim Walz over his move this week to reduce remote work options.\nWalz announced that, starting June 1, most state-agency employees have to carry out their duties in person at least 50% of the time. That has drawn swift criticism from the unions that negotiate for nearly 40,000 state workers, including the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees.\nThe American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 5 is another, and at a Thursday news conference, its executive director, Bart Andersen, expressed frustration about having no input in the decision.\n\"If we are going to be considered a labor-friendly state, we need to have conversations,\" he said, \"not dropped at the last minute and told that all these people have to go back to work in a month and a half, with no means to get there.\"\nMAPE officials have said this also disrupts the lives of workers with children, citing day-care demands and long waiting lists for those facilities.\nThe governor has pointed to an exemption for people who live more than 75 miles from their primary work location. He also has said the change should help downtown businesses in the Twin Cities by spurring more foot traffic.\nThese debates have been happening in the private sector, too, since the constraints of the pandemic have faded. But Andersen suggested to anyone who believes remote workers are \"slacking off\" to think again.\n\"They're not in a bubble. They're not isolated,\" he said. \"They're working with their teams and they're getting the work done.\"\nAndersen said they know tasks such as road maintenance can't be done from home. But he highlighted the effectiveness of telework in recruiting and attracting people for the public-sector jobs that have that flexibility. The mounting tension between these labor groups and the administration comes as talks on a new contract take shape.\nget more stories like this via email\nSocial Issues\nFor thousands of Mississippians leaving prison each year, a single question looms large: Who will hire me?
