  "text": "IT major Infosys on Wednesday sent out emails to around 40-45 trainees informing them of discontinuation of their training contracts for failing the company’s final internal assessment process.Infosys layoff details“Further to the announcement of the results of your final assessment attempt, please be informed that you have not met the qualifying criteria in the ‘Foundation skills training program’ despite the additional preparation time, doubt-clearing sessions and several mock assessments opportunities,” the email sent to the trainees read.As a result, you will not be able to continue your journey in the apprenticeship program,” the email read. ET has reviewed the email.Besides counselling support, as part of the process, the Bengaluru-headquartered IT giant said it has planned for professional outplacement services to support the trainees.Additionally, the affected trainees have been offered an alternative career pathway, by taking an Infosys sponsored 12-week external training program for potential roles in the Business Process Management (BPM) industry. On successful completion of this training, the candidates could also apply to Infosys BPM Ltd.Infosys did not respond to queries concerning the fresh developments.Previous instance of job cuts by InfosysAround February 7, Infosys had asked around 350 trainees to resign, terming that they failed to qualify their internal assessment programme in three attempts.Infosys in a statement had said it has a rigorous hiring process and freshers, “after undergoing extensive foundational training”, are expected to clear internal assessments. “All freshers get three attempts to clear the assessment, failing which they will not be able to continue with the organisation, as is also mentioned in their contract,” the company said, adding that this process “ensures a high quality of talent availability for our clients”.",
