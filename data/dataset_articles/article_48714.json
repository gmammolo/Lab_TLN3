  "text": "Sky has announced 2,000 jobs at its customer service centres are at risk.\nThe Company plans to close its Stockport, Sheffield and Leeds Central contact centres\nSky says the planned job losses reflect declining call volumes as customers increasingly use digital technology to conduct their business.\nCllr Mark Hunter, leader of Stockport Council said:\nWe are shocked and deeply concerned by the sudden announcement that Sky is closing its call centre in Stockport — without warning — leaving local jobs, families, and our economy facing an unexpected and significant blow.\n“There was no prior indication of this decision, making it all the more alarming. Our immediate priority is to understand the full implications of this decision and to support those affected.\n“I am urgently seeking a meeting at the highest levels with Sky’s leadership to discuss their rationale, explore any possible alternatives, and ensure they fulfil their responsibilities to their employees and our community.\n“I will be looking to work closely with our local MPs and the Greater Manchester Mayor to push for meaningful support for affected workers and to explore new opportunities for investment and employment in Stockport.\n“Stockport is a thriving hub for business and innovation, and we stand with our workers, and we will do everything in our power to secure a positive outcome for them and for our town.”",
