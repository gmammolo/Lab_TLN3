  "text": "The Federal Law Enforcement Training Accreditation (FLETA) Board is pleased to announce Elaine Wilson Harrison as the 2025 recipient of the FLETA Team Leader Recognition Award. FLETA Board Parliamentarian, Bennie Henderson, presented the Team Leader Recognition Award to Ms. Wilson Harrison during the FLETA Board meeting on January 15, 2026.\nA critical link between the FLETA Board and the assessment teams are those individuals who volunteer to serve as team leaders. The team leader not only manages and oversees the process; team leaders serve as mentors, coordinate, and negotiate with the agency, and represent the professionalism and excellence of the FLETA process in everything that they do.\n“On behalf of the FLETA Board, I am pleased to recognize Elaine Wilson Harrison as the recipient of the 2025 FLETA Team Leader Recognition Award,” stated Mr. Henderson.\nMs. Wilson Harrison’s management skills align with those of a servant leader. In addition to serving as a team leader and assessor on numerous FLETA assessments, Ms. Wilson Harrison continues to provide support to other federal law enforcement agencies as a source of expertise. She models humility, remains flexible, and demonstrates exceptional leadership as a team leader.\nThe FLETA Team Leader Recognition Award recognizes individuals who have contributed significantly or demonstrated exceptional commitment while serving in a team leader capacity during the FLETA accreditation process. The team leader has successfully demonstrated an effective and innovative approach associated with obtaining the highest quality of federal law enforcement training. The FLETA Team Leader Recognition Award is intended as an individual annual award; however, the Board may consider multiple candidates.\nThe FLETA Board is the accrediting body for all federal law enforcement training and support programs. To achieve accreditation, agencies submit to an independent review of their academy and/or program to ensure compliance with the FLETA Standards and Procedures in the areas of Administration, Instructor Staff, Training Development, and Training Delivery. Accreditation is a cyclical process occurring every five years. Each year, training organizations must submit annual reports in preparation for reaccreditation, which is a new and independent review of the program/academy.",
