  "text": "[Unofficial translation provided by the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre]\n“Shin sung motors union accuses targeted firing of union leaders, demands end to unfair labour practices\", 24 March 2025\nThe Gwangju-Jeonnam branch of the National Metal Workers' Union held a press conference today (24th) in front of Shin Sung Motors[(mercedes-benz dealership]’s Gwangju showroom, calling for the \"revocation of the collective contract termination for union leaders, the reinstatement of union members to their duties, and honest negotiations.\"\nThe union stated, \"We expected an end to discrimination against union members and sincere negotiations, but instead, Shin Sung Motors sent contract termination notices to eight union leaders, citing poor performance. The majority of these leaders' performance issues stemmed from their exclusion from showroom sales shifts,\" alleging discrimination against the union.\nThe union also revealed that the Jeonnam Regional Labour Commission had recognised the exclusion of union members from showroom shifts, the barring of union members wearing union vests from attending sales-related meetings, and the refusal to negotiate and delays in negotiations as unfair labour practices.\nIn response, Shin Sung Motors asserted, \"The termination of union leaders' contracts was a result of performance evaluations based on established criteria and internal business decisions. The claim that union members were excluded from showroom shifts is based on operational efficiency and the circumstances of the store, and no discrimination or disadvantage was directed at specific union members.\"\nShin Sung Motors also addressed the claims of delayed negotiations, stating, \"We have conducted a total of 13 rounds of collective bargaining since July 2024, and we are continuously striving to reach a mutual agreement.\"",
