Picture: Alamy By Kit Heren\n@yung_chuvak Staff in Angela Rayner's own department have voted to go on strike after being told to come into the office more often.\nListen to this article Loading audio... Union members at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local government backed industrial action four to one, on a two-thirds turnout.\nThe Public and Commercial Service (PCS) union's strike was due to office closures, and in response to \"rigid office attendance policies\".\nCivil servants were told in October that they must be in the office at least 60% of the time, which works out at three days per week for most people.\nThe government plans to close offices in Birmingham, Exeter, Newcastle, Sheffield, Truro, and Warrington over the next two years.\nRead more: Angela Rayner insists there were no plans for 'personal safari tour' during official trip to Ethiopia\nRead more: Labour's worker's rights reforms to have 'net negative' impact on the economy, says OBR\nCaller Jason tells Tom Swarbrick 'the real reason' he thinks CEOs want people back in the office\nThe department is also set to open offices in London, Wolverhampton, Darlington, Manchester and Bristol. All staff will be given the opportunity to relocate.\nIt comes as Ms Rayner, who is also deputy Prime Minister, tries to get her sweeping Employment Rights Bill passed into law.\nThe PCS said that the closures \"threaten the livelihoods\" of some of its members and also remove jobs from \"some of the most deprived areas in the country.\"\nThe union's general secretary Fran Heathcote said: “These office closures not only threaten the livelihoods of our members but also remove the presence of the government department responsible for local communities from some of the most deprived areas in the country.\n\"As the main face of the Employment Rights Bill, the Deputy Prime Minister must match her words with action and listen to her own workers.\nAngela Rayner. Picture: Alamy \"Members are deeply concerned about how these closures may affect their ability to rebuild local government, promote regional development and deliver on Labour’s mission to build 1.5 million new homes.\n\"They stand ready to strike to defend their offices, their communities, and their employment rights.\"\nA Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"We will continue to engage with unions and staff about a number of proposals - including plans to expand five offices outside of London and close six offices over the next two years, as leases come to an end.\n\"The department will continue to have offices in every English region as well as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and all staff affected will be able to continue in their roles in one of these locations.\"\nAngela Rayner joins Tom Swarbrick as Labour announces £2 billion for affordable housing | Watch in full\nIt comes after the fiscal watchdog warned that Ms Rayner's Employments Rights Bill would have a \"net negative impact\" on the economy.\nLabour last year revealed a major package of reforms under the Employment Rights Bill, hailed as the biggest boost to pay and productivity in the workplace in a generation.\nBut according to the the Office for Budget Responsibility's economic and fiscal outlook for March 2025, the economy will take a hit as a result.\nThe OBR wrote: \"Employment regulation policies that affect the flexibility of businesses and labour markets or the quantity and quality of work will likely have material, and probably net negative, economic impacts on employment, prices, and productivity.\n\"Given these potentially significant impacts, we will incorporate a central estimate of the aggregate impacts of the policy package in our next forecast.\"\nLatest Donald Trump News Greenland PM brands Usha Vance and US delegation's visit a 'provocation' as anti-Trump protestors swarm streets 'It's a lot of stuff' - Trump releases 80,000 classified pages relating to JFK assassination, honouring campaign promise Trump says 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico 'will go forward' in March after month-long delay 'Two shooters' involved in JFK assassination, claims task force head - as FBI reveals thousands of secret files Trump to host Netanyahu in Washington marking first foreign leader visit since US inauguration El Salvador offers to accept US deportees and criminals in 'unprecedented' migrant deal China announces retaliatory tariffs on US as Trump's levies take effect - but Canada and Mexico's are paused Trump pauses 25% tariffs on Canada for 30 days as President says call with Trudeau went 'very well' Britain will not choose between EU and US, says Starmer following Trump's tariff threats US trade tariffs on Mexico paused for a month after border deal Latest Politics News Judges reject Government's request to change 'corrosive' sentencing rules as 'two-tier justice' row erupts Northern England will no longer be 'held to ransom' by poor transport systems, says Starmer Australia to hold federal election in May as housing and inflation among key issues Donald Trump pushes for near-total control of Ukraine’s minerals and energy in huge increase on earlier demands Reform deputy says mental health is modern equivalent of ‘back pain’ - and disabled people are ‘swinging the lead’ I look forward to a statement that hits people like me, rather than those who can’t afford to eat, writes Andrew Marr Labour's worker's rights reforms to have 'net negative' impact on the economy, says OBR Online Islamophobic abuse targeting Sadiq Khan more than doubled last year, figures suggest Reeves 'to slash 50,000 civil service jobs' as she pushes to cut spending by £2 billion per year Starmer's ultimatum to councils: Prove you're tackling potholes or face losing cash",
