  "text": "Workers at AB InBev breweries in Leuven en Hoegaarden down tools in dispute over “toxic climate” at the company\nWorkers at the multi-national drinks company AB Inbev's breweries in Leuven and Hoegaarden (both Flemish Brabant) are staging a lightning strike. They are protesting at what they describe as “toxic climate” at AB Inbev. They are demanding urgent talks with management to resolve the issues.\nA picket has been in place at the gates of the Hoegaarden brewery since Friday morning and access to the brewery is blocked. Staff are also taking strike action at AB Inbev’s Leuven breweries site and at its various depots around the country. The union says that “toxic measures” at AB Inbev has led to the strike.\nGert Engels of the socialist trade union ABVV told VRT News that his members are fed up with they way they are being treated. “There is no single incident that has triggered the strike, but there is zero respect for the workers. Staff shortages have also played a role”.\nThe unions are calling for talks with management.. \"We are always asking for this, but management doesn’t want talks”. Lieven Guelinckx of the liberal trade union adds that consolatory talks planned for 27 February didn’t go ahead as management dismissed a constructive proposal for mediation to end the dispute that was put forward by the arbitrator out of hand. proposed by the conciliation agency to get out of the conflict. Mr Guelinckx added that the current situation is having a negative impact on the safety and health of AB Inbev staff.\nThe company has yet to release a statement.",
