  "text": "Infosys Fires Over 40 Trainees for Failing Internal Assessments Karnataka DC Correspondent 27 March 2025 11:09 AM IST The termination follows a string of layoffs at the Mysuru campus, with affected trainees unable to meet the company's performance criteria despite additional training support x Infosys dismisses 30-45 trainees from its Mysuru branch after they failed to meet internal assessment standards despite additional preparation and mock tests. Software giant Infosys terminated at least 30 to 45 trainees from its Mysuru branch on Wednesday after they reportedly failed to meet the company’s internal assessment standards. The affected trainees, who were part of the Foundation Skills Training Program, were given several opportunities for additional preparation, including mock assessments and doubt-clearing sessions. However, despite these efforts, they did not meet the passing criteria, leading to their dismissal.\nSources revealed that this round of terminations comes just months after the company had already laid off around 350 trainees from the same campus. These previous trainees had experienced significant onboarding delays, waiting for over 2.5 years before being hired. The latest wave of layoffs has raised concerns regarding the company's training and assessment practices, especially within its entry-level programs.\nInfosys, known for its rigorous training programs, typically invests significant resources into the onboarding and skill development of its new employees. However, the company’s internal assessments have become increasingly stringent, and these recent terminations highlight the growing pressure to meet performance expectations.\nThe company has yet to issue an official statement regarding the latest round of layoffs. However, industry analysts suggest that these actions may reflect broader challenges in the tech industry, where companies are recalibrating their workforce strategies in response to market conditions and evolving skill demands.\nThe terminated trainees, who were primarily fresh graduates, now face an uncertain future in a competitive job market. While Infosys has not commented on the specifics of the terminations, sources close to the matter indicate that the company continues to focus on refining its training and assessment processes to maintain high standards.\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )",
