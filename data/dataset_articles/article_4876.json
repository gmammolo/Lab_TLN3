  "text": "New Delhi: In the crowded lanes of North Delhi's Sabzi Mandi, a routine afternoon turned dramatic when a 60-year-old woman refused to be a victim. Moments after her phone was snatched on Jan 19, Geeta's quick thinking—calling the stolen phone and staying in contact with the accused—set off a swift chase that ended with the snatcher in police custody.\nTired of too many ads? go ad free now Geeta, an anganwadi worker, had just finished a meeting around 11.35 am and was heading towards Barfkhana. She took out her phone to call her daughter around 11.40 am when a youth on a scooter suddenly appeared, grabbed her phone and sped off towards Karol Bagh via the Maharani Jhansi Flyover. Instead of panicking, she rushed back to her office and borrowed a colleague's phone to call her own number. To her surprise, the snatcher answered and demanded, \"Bring Rs 2,000–Rs 3,000 and take your phone.\"\nTurning the situation to her advantage, Geeta stayed on the call and gathered information about his location. She informed people at the office, and one of them called the police. A PCR van arrived with two constables, who also called the stolen phone from the colleague's handset. The accused claimed he was on Maharani Jhansi Flyover and reiterated his demand for Rs 3,000. The cops then made Geeta get into an auto and, following her directions, searched for the phone snatcher, going from Barfkhana up the Maharani Jhansi Flyover and taking a U-turn near Filmistan.\nAt the flyover, the trap snapped. The thief—still clutching the stolen phone and expecting an easy payoff—was intercepted by Geeta and the constables. The snatcher was identified as Rohit Yadav (22), a resident of Sonia Vihar. The stolen phone was recovered. An officer said the accused was taken into custody and a case was registered. This was not an isolated instance of citizen alertness aiding law enforcement. Earlier this month in Narela, three friends helped police track down armed robbers who had held a mobile shop owner at knifepoint. Last Oct, a 61-year-old woman, with the help of bystanders, thwarted two motorcycle-borne men who attempted to snatch her purse in Model Town. The suspects were caught by the crowd and handed over to police.\nEnd of Article Follow Us On Social Media",
