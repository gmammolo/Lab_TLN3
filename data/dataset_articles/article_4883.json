  "text": "Key Points\n- A Golden Retriever howls along with the 'Law & Order' theme song as a daily routine.\n- The video of the dog singing gained praise and joking comments on TikTok.\n- Experts say dogs howl due to ancestral wolf communication triggered by certain music pitches.\nIf you have a doggy, you understand that having a routine is a positive tool to keep them as happy as possible. Some tasks on the list of routines are nothing to get excited about, like bath time or nail cutting. But there are plenty of things a dog looks forward to doing in their day, and in the case of one Golden Retriever, sitting down to watch his favorite TV show is top-tier fun.\nDogs can’t exactly tell time, but this Golden Retriever has a different way to be alerted that it’s time for rest and TV, and it’s actually really funny.\nTikToker @emnm03 shared a video of their adorable Golden Retriever, who knows it’s time to hang with the family and watch TV once the ‘Law & Order’ theme song comes on.\nThe moment the show’s theme song starts, he gets ready for his routine task of singing along. He walks up to the TV, eyes fixated on the screen, and when he hears the sound cue, he begins to howl (his version of singing). It’s not the full song that he’s adding his vocals to; it’s just very specific parts where he does his best to harmonize. It’s cute, in a doggy kinda way.\nGolden Retriever’s Attempt To 'Look Tough' About New Puppy Is Cracking People Up\nHis attempt at menace could win awards for comedy.\nDevan McGuinness\n0In the comment section, hundreds of people sang his praises for his beautiful golden voice.\nOne person wrote, “The walk off, he knows he aced it.”\nAnother shared, “In the doggy justice system, treat-based offenses are considered especially heinous.”\nSomeone else explained, “The way he walked away after looking at you guys, ‘You’re welcome.'”\nAnother joked, “It’s something with the saxophone. My dog howls only for music like this, too.”\nOther comments included, “His tribute to all the special victims,” “He likes saxophone!!! You should try different songs,” “Neighbors; they’re watching ‘Law & Order’ again,” “These are HIS stories,” and “The way he approaches wiggling his tail.”\nWhy Do Dogs Sing at the TV?\nThere is no denying that this dog has a really cute singing voice. But have you ever wondered why pups howl at the TV or songs? Experts say it’s a throwback to their past.\nAccording to Wag!, dogs sing like this because they are descended from wolves. Howling is what wolves do to chat with each other; it’s how they communicate over great distances.\nWhile this Golden Retriever isn’t necessarily singing to his wolf pack, the theory is that a certain pitch in music triggers their memory.\nAbout the author\nDevan McGuinness\nPet News Writer",
