  "text": "Civil servants to strike over Sheffield office closure\nMembers of the PCS union are opposed to plans to close six offices, including one in South Yorkshire\nWorkers in a government department have voted to strike in a dispute over office closures, which would see one location in South Yorkshire go.\nMembers of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government backed industrial action by almost four to one on a 66% turnout.\nThe union says there are plans to close offices in Birmingham, Exeter, Newcastle, Sheffield, Truro, and Warrington.\nPCS general secretary Fran Heathcote said: \"These office closures not only threaten the livelihoods of our members but also remove the presence of the government department responsible for local communities from some of the most deprived areas in the country.\n\"Members are deeply concerned about how these closures may affect their ability to rebuild local government, promote regional development and deliver on Labour's mission to build 1.5 million new homes.\n\"They stand ready to strike to defend their offices, their communities and their employment rights.\"\nHear all the latest news from across the UK on the hour, every hour, on Greatest Hits Radio on DAB, smartspeaker, at greatesthitsradio.co.uk, and on the Rayo app.",
