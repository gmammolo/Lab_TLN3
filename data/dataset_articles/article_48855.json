Get the latest from Joanne Laucius straight to your inbox Sign Up Photo by JULIE OLIVER / Postmedia\nArticle content Academic staff whose jobs are being eliminated as part of $20 million in budget cuts at Ottawa's largest school board have received notice. Under collective agreements, staff members at the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board who are to be laid off must be notified before the end of March, ahead of the regular budget debate. Last week, facing a $20-million deficit, trustees reluctantly approved cutting about 150 positions, including about 80 non-academic positions to save $7.08 million and about 70 staff in discretionary academic positions to save $8.823 million. Some of the reductions will come through attrition, including retirements and resignations, not filling vacant positions and eliminating other positions.\nAdvertisement 2 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY Subscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.
