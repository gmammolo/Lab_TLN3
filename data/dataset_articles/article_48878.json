  "text": "Monrovia – The Movement for Progressive Change (MPC), led by Simeon Freeman, has condemned the use of force by state security forces against students protesting in Monrovia.\nBy Edwin Genoway, edwingenoway@frontpageafricaonline.com\nThe students, demanding improved conditions for their teachers and the restoration of their education, were met with tear gas and violent repression by security forces.\nThe protests, which have continued for several days, stemmed from a teachers’ strike due to unresolved grievances over low pay and poor working conditions.\nIn response, the MPC issued a statement criticizing the government’s heavy-handed approach, calling for dialogue and peaceful negotiations. The political party emphasized that the use of force against peaceful demonstrators is a violation of human rights and democracy.\n“This violence against peaceful students is unacceptable and a clear violation of the principles of democracy and human rights,” the MPC said in a statement. “The government must listen to the legitimate demands of the students and teachers.”\nSimeon Freeman, leader of the MPC, stressed that the use of force only escalates tensions and damages the government’s credibility. He called for a peaceful resolution that addresses the pressing issues surrounding the education sector, including adequate compensation for teachers.\n“The students are rightfully advocating for their education, and the government must ensure that their voices are heard,” Freeman said. “We cannot continue to ignore the concerns of both students and teachers.”\nThe protests have caused significant disruptions in Monrovia, with students blocking major roads in the capital, hindering vehicle movement. However, the MPC reiterated its support for peaceful protest and urged students to avoid further escalation by seeking constructive dialogue with the government.\nThe MPC also called on the government to resolve the ongoing teachers’ strike, which has left many classrooms vacant, by improving teachers’ salaries and benefits. The party warned that if the government continues to neglect these issues, they will take legal action to hold it accountable.",
