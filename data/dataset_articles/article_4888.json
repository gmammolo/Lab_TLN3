  "text": "Johnson measure strengthening penalties for child exploitation passes House Judiciary Committee\nPublished 2:00 pm Thursday, January 22, 2026\nFrankfort, Kentucky (January 21, 2026)- This week, the House Standing Committee on Judiciary passed HB 366. The measure, sponsored by State Representative DJ Johnson of Owensboro, is aimed at modifying laws relating to child pornography.\n“HB 366 sends a clear message that exploiting children will not be tolerated,” Johnson said. “As a General Assembly, it is our job to pass policy to protect the most vulnerable population.”\nThe measure would modify existing laws to include computer-generated images and require an offender to serve at least 85 percent of the sentence before being eligible for probation or parole.\nHB 366 clarifies that knowingly possessing or intentionally viewing visual depictions of sexual performances of minors constitutes a criminal offense while maintaining clear protections for accidental viewing and legitimate legal and law enforcement investigations.\n“This bill is about keeping up with enhanced technology,” Johnson added. “By closing loopholes and strengthening accountability, we are reinforcing our efforts to protect children and hold offenders accountable.”\nThe measure now moves to the full House for consideration.
