  "text": "The Finnish Police Union (SPJL) is planning a strike. This is reported by foreign media.\nThe date of the strike has not yet been set, but it should take place soon. The police strike may be joined by customs, border security, prison and other law enforcement officials who agree with the requirements of the SPJL.\nOn March 25, the trade unions representing these groups of employees issued a joint statement criticizing the actions of the employer (the Office of Government Affairs), which refuses to support the demand for a 7.8% salary increase over three years, similar to the employees of the trade sector who achieved such an increase.\nThe union rejected the employer's offer to increase wages by 6.3% over three years. As a result, negotiations were suspended because, from the point of view of the Office of Government Affairs, a 7.8% increase is unrealistic against the background of public financial debt and austerity measures introduced two years ago.\nConstruction workers, industrial workers, port staff, air traffic controllers and supermarket vendors have been on strike in Finland over the past two years, but for the first time since 1976, a police union has decided to go on strike. During the strike period, some police officers will continue to work in accordance with the occupational safety regulations in force in Finland to ensure the safety of life, health and the environment.\nAfter severing economic ties with Russia, inflation in Finland rose from 2.1% in 2021 to 6.2% in 2023 and remained at high levels in 2024 and 2025, forcing the government to cut social spending.",
