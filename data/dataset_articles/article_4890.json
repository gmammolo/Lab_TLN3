  "text": "The Last of Sydney’s “Diabolical” Lockout Laws Have Been Scrapped\nSydney’s controversial lockout laws were first announced in January 2014. Restricting movement between venues, the sale of shots, opening hours and more, they were in response to a growing trend of alcohol-related violence in the party-geared areas of Kings Cross, Oxford Street and the CBD. But, 12 years later, the Minns NSW government is repealing the last of the laws.\n“I’m delighted to say goodbye to this chapter of Sydney’s nightlife story,” John Graham, the minister for music and the night-time economy, said in a statement. “The lockouts had good intentions but a diabolical impact on the night-time economy and the reputation of our city. These were the laws that saw Madonna and Justin Bieber not allowed into their own afterparties, and the decimation of the club scene that spawned Rufus Du Sol and Flight Facilities.”\nThe lockout laws prohibited people entering pubs and clubs in the CBD, Kings Cross and along Oxford Street after 1.30am, and all bars were required to stop serving drinks at 3am. There were bans on shots and double-pours, as well as the switch to plastic glasses from midnight.\nIn 2016, public opinion on the laws were mixed. There were complaints of lax rules for venues with pokies, with social movement Keep Sydney Open rallying for alternative measures to keep Sydney safe. By 2019, there’d been an 80 per cent drop in foot traffic in Kings Cross and along Oxford Street, and 418 licensed venues had closed.\n“This policy had the unintended consequence of damaging the city’s live music scene and Sydney’s reputation as a global city, with over half our music venues going out of business in the following decade,” this week’s NSW Government statement reads.\nIn 2020, some parts of the laws were walked back, with Kings Cross remaining locked out. “The Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research has confirmed downward trends in alcohol-related violence in the Sydney CBD and Kings Cross over the past five years following earlier changes to lockout laws,” David Harris, the minister for gaming and racing, said in a statement. “These included an extension of last drinks from 3am to 3.30am and the repeal of the 1.30am lockout.”\nAs of today, with the continued downward trend of alcohol-related violence, the NSW Government is removing the final lockout conditions. Venues will no longer be required to use plastic cups after midnight, and 3.30am will no longer mean last drinks. The requirement for RSA marshals after midnight, per-person drinks limits and late-night shots have also been scrapped.\nLiquor & Gaming has confirmed a case-by-case approach will be taken as issues arise. It will continue with the violent incident registers, preservation of crime scenes, and a ban on gang colours and signs.\nThese updates work together with the recent drive of designated special entertainment precincts, which work – via extended trading hours, encouraging live music and more – to supercharge Sydney’s $110 billion night-time economy.\nAbout the author",
