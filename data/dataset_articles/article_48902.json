  "text": "More than 4 in 5 large companies in fierce competition over top talent – work-based immigration and employee benefits among the solutions\nCompetition among large Finnish companies for talented employees shows no signs of slowing down. According to OP's Survey of Large Corporations, two out of three large companies see work-based immigration as a way to ensure international competitiveness. Many companies have also adopted new methods for attracting and committing employees, according to OP Life Assurance Company's statistics.\nDespite the downturn in the economy, competition for employees and top talent has remained strong, OP's Survey of Large Corporations reveals. Of the executives that responded to the survey, 83% agreed with the statement \"competition for good employers and special expertise is intense in our sector\". Competition was perceived as exceptionally fierce by large companies in the retail sector, where 96% of respondents agreed with the statement.\nThe results of the Survey of Large Corporations over several years show that competition for top talent has remained strong for years. Since 2021, more than 80% of large companies have perceived the competition for good employees and special expertise to be intense. In 2022, this figure was as high as 98%.\nNearly half of surveyed large companies listed labour shortages among the three most significant risks facing their operations.\n\"Due to the poor economic situation, the number of jobseekers was higher than usual the past few years, and companies' need to compete for talent calmed for a while. Little by little, the economy has been showing signs of a turn for the better, however. Now is the time for employers to invest in attracting talent, before the competition and labour shortages return in earnest,\" says Katja Keitaanniemi, CEO of OP Corporate Bank.\nTwo out of three large companies see work-based immigration as a solution to the challenge of international competitiveness\nWork-based immigration is seen as one of the most important antidotes to companies falling behind competitors in China, the United States and elsewhere. Of the executives of large companies surveyed, 68% see work-based immigration as promoting the company's international competitiveness decisively or moderately.\nNearly four in ten companies say that they offer many specialist roles that do not require proficiency in Finnish. In the near future, large companies plan on hiring both non-specialist employees and specialists, in particular from the euro area and the rest of the EU. Companies also plan on hiring non-specialist employees from Asian countries outside China and India and specialists from India and the United States.\nAt the same time, as many as one in three large companies believe that the current government's immigration policy considerably impedes the recruitment of both specialist and ordinary, non-specialist workers from abroad.\nRetention alongside attraction: interest in commitment through employee benefits on the rise\nIn addition to OP's Survey of Large Corporations, the competition for talent is visible in OP Life Assurance Company's statistics. According to statistics, more and more employers seek to commit their employees by offering voluntary pension insurance as an employee benefit: between 2020 and 2024, the premiums of group pension plans taken out by employers for employees increased by as much as 77%.\n\"In recent years, the competition for labour has forced companies to take a critical look at their attractiveness in the eyes of talented employees. In addition to attracting new talent, many companies are increasingly investing in ways to secure the commitment of existing employees. Even the most attractive employer image is not enough in the competition for talent if the employer's ability to retain employees is not in order,\" says Kristiina Michelsson, CEO of OP Life Assurance Company.\nMedia enquiries:\nOP Financial Group Communications, tel. 010 252 8719, viestinta@op.fi\nThe results are based on OP's annual Survey of Large Corporations, which measures large Finnish corporations' views on business and economic developments. The target group of the survey is comprised of 250 of the largest companies in terms of net sales operating in Finland. They can be either companies established in Finland or Finnish subsidiaries of foreign companies. This year’s survey received responses from 207 senior executives of 137 such companies. According to their latest certified financial statements, the responding companies have a combined revenue of over 202 billion euros, and they employ over 431,000 people in total. The survey was conducted in autumn 2024. OP Financial Group carries out the Survey of Large Corporations in partnership with the Nordic Institute of Business and Society (NIBS) think tank founded by Aalto University professors.\nOP Financial Group is Finland’s largest financial services group, with more than two million owner-customers and over 14,000 employees.
