  "text": "TAUNTON – More than 100 employees at Summit Delivery Solutions, an Amazon-affiliated delivery center, will soon be out of a job. A Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) notice, which was filed on March 20 with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, disclosed that 101 workers employed at the delivery center, located at 350 Revolutionary Drive in Taunton, will be laid off. The WARN notice indicates the effective layoff date being March 31. According to its website , Summit formed in 2021 and is a delivery service partner for Amazon. “Our company regularly conducts middle-mile transportation of palletized goods to businesses, schools, and post offices all over New England. Additionally, our associates perform last-mile delivery and white-glove services throughout the Boston metropolitan area,” said on its LinkedIn profile page . Summit’s website also touts that it is veteran-owned. According to its LinkedIn page, Summit Delivery Solutions employs over 100 delivery associates. A representative from Summit Delivery Solutions said over the phone the company declines to comment. Federal law requires employers with 100 or more employees to provide notice at least 60 calendar-days in advance of planned plant closings and mass layoffs. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act , commonly known as WARN, exists to ensure workers have ample time to prepare for job transitions. Notice must be given if the plant closings affect 50 or more employees or if layoffs affect at least 33% of the employed workforce. If a mass layoff or branch closure will occur when a business is sold, the WARN Act still applies and the seller must give at least 60-day notice to employees. Exceptions to the 60-day period for giving notices include unforeseeable business circumstances, natural disasters, and the chance that the notice would destroy new sources of capital that could keep a branch open.
