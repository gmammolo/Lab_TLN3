  "text": "CHESTER COUNTY, Pa. (WPVI) -- TV network QVC, which is based in Chester County, is cutting ties with nearly 900 employees.\nHowever, the bulk of the job cuts will impact employees based in Florida.\nAlso, the QVC-owned \"Home Shopping Network,\" is preparing to move its entire operation to the Philadelphia region.\nWhile this will mean fewer jobs for the company, it could mean more job opportunities in Chester County, Pennsylvania.",
