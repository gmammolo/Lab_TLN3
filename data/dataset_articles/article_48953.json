  "text": "( KTLA ) – Sorry, savvy In-N-Out Burger orderers, this menu loophole has been closed. According to a memorandum sent out to In-N-Out stores and later posted to Reddit, the iconic burger chain is raising prices on individual slices of meat with cheese. In the memo, Chief Operating Officer Denny Warnick said the increase is intended to match the price of the secret menu favorite , the Flying Dutchman. The off-menu item is simply two meat patties topped with two slices of cheese — no bun or other toppings included. That item is typically priced around $5.50 in California, according to SFGate . Savvy In-N-Out goers figured out that ordering the patties and cheese individually comes out to about $3.40. The cost of adding patties and cheese to regular burgers, such as Double-Doubles and 3×3’s, will not change. The memo sent by Warnick claimed that the price increase is due to “confusion” surrounding the pricing of the items. Warnick told employees to be understanding to customers should they be surprised by the change. For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to WJHL | Tri-Cities News & Weather.",
