  "text": "Sky will reportedly lay off its employees in the UK. Sky, the parent company of Sky News, has announced that 2,000 jobs at its customer service centres are at risk. As per a report of Sky News, the company has announced proposals that include the closure of three sites in the UK, which would impact approximately 7% of its workforce. The company’s decision is said to be a part of a major business transformation to deliver quicker, simpler, and more digital customer service. As per reports, the company has stated that the layoffs are a response to declining call volumes, as more customers are opting to use digital technology for their business needs.
