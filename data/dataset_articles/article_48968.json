  "text": "United Airlines technicians have rejected a proposal to outsource work to China, according to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT). The news comes shortly after United Airlines' technicians once again rallied nationwide, demanding improved wages and more comprehensive health care coverage.\n\"Disgraceful economic proposal\"\nThe labor union, representing United's Aircraft Maintenance Technicians (AMTs), has voted down the proposal to what they called \"the carrier's latest disgraceful economic proposal.\" Notably, 99.5% of United Airlines' mechanics represented by the Teamsters Union rejected the deal, which would have outsourced the workforce to \"communist China.\"\nIn a statement released on March 25, 2025, Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien and Teamsters Airline Division Director Chris Griswold, said:\n\"United Airlines' executives think they can strong-arm 10,000 Teamsters technicians into accepting a terrible deal. Instead, our members just sent a clear message that this company can't ignore. United's radical, un-American contract proposal is dead on arrival.\n\"United's short-sighted cash grab reflects everything that's wrong with Big Business at a time when we should be bringing back jobs to America.\"\nThe Teamsters Union represents more than 10,000 United Airlines maintenance technicians across the country. Simple Flying has asked United Airlines for comment.\nTechnicians battle for fair pay\nIn 2024, United reported pre-tax earnings of $4.2 billion and an adjusted net income of $3.5 billion. While United Airlines has cashed in during the year, its technicians have been fighting for stronger employment contracts, demanding increased pay, higher safety standards, and better health care coverage.\n\"United raked in $4 billion in profits last year off the backs of highly skilled, hardworking Teamsters who keep planes flying safely. Rather than reward them, United wants to gut good American jobs and gamble with safety.\"\nThe technicians have also been unhappy about United Airlines sending its aircraft offshore for heavy maintenance, something the union highlighted in its statement earlier in March 2025. O'Brien described the situation as a reckless race to the bottom and something the Teamsters Union would not stand for.\nOn March 13, 2025, United Airlines' maintenance workers once again rallied at the carrier's San Francisco Maintenance Base (SFO). This was not the first time the airline's technicians had rallied for more substantial contracts. The workers picketed outside airports in August and September 2024, and again in March 2025.\nIt is worth noting that United Airlines has one of the largest fleets in the world. It operates a total of 1,015 aircraft, with an average age of 17.2 years, according to ch-aviation fleets data. Notably, the Chicago-based carrier's fleet comprises 141 Boeing 737-800s, 136 Boeing 737-900ERs, 114 Boeing 737 MAX 8s, 92 Boeing 737 MAX 9s, 96 Boeing 777s, 81 Airbus A319-100s, 76 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, 78 Airbus A320-200s, 61 Boeing 757s, 53 Boeing 767s, 40 Boeing 737-700s, 33 Airbus A321neo aircraft, and 12 Boeing 737-900s.\nIt is not uncommon for airlines across the world to send widebody aircraft offshore for maintenance, particularly when heavy checks are needed. Airlines in the US, Europe, and Asia often outsource those involved checks to specialists to reduce cost or to find shop capacity they may not have available in-house at that time.\nRelated\n\"We Won't Rest\": United Airlines Maintenance Technicians Rally For New Contract\nUnited Airlines and its maintenance technicians are in dispute over an employment contract deal",
