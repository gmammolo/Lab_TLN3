  "text": "DAVIESS CO. – Indiana Conservation Officer Caden Graber, who serves Daviess County, has been selected as the 2025 District 7 Officer of the Year.\nOfficer Caden Graber “Across Indiana, conservation officers are on the front lines promoting public safety in the outdoors and protecting our state’s vital natural resources,” said Governor Mike Braun. “I congratulate the officers from each of the 10 districts who have earned this distinguished honor for their exceptional service on behalf of Hoosiers in 2025.”\nGraber has served as a conservation officer for three years. He served in Putnam County before transferring to Daviess County, where he has served since 2023.\nIn addition to his normal duties as a field officer, Graber serves as a public safety diver for the Department of Natural Resources Division of Law Enforcement.\nDistrict 7 includes Knox, Daviess, Martin, Gibson, Pike, Dubois, Posey, Vanderburgh, Warrick, and Spencer counties.\nThe district award puts Graber in the running for the Pitzer Award, which is presented to the top overall conservation officer in the state and is selected from the 10 district winners.\nThe Pitzer Award is named after Conservation Officer James D. Pitzer, who was fatally shot while investigating illegal hunting activity on Jan. 2, 1961, in Jay County.",
