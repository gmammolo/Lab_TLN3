  "text": "\"ED case was not even right,\" says Saurabh Bharadwaj as court acquits Arvind Kejriwal\nBy ANI | Updated: January 23, 2026 01:00 IST2026-01-23T06:29:35+5:302026-01-23T01:00:03+5:30\nNew Delhi [India], January 23 : After a Rouse Avenue court on Thursday acquitted former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind ...\nNew Delhi [India], January 23 : After a Rouse Avenue court on Thursday acquitted former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in two cases that were linked to the alleged non-compliance of summons issued to him by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the Delhi Excise policy case, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Delhi president Saurabh Bharadwaj expressed his views on the verdict.\nSaurabh Bharadwaj said, \"To win Delhi elections, the BJP slapped false cases on AAP leaders. Before the elections, all leaders were arrested and jailed for two years. Now, when the elections have concluded, ED has nothing to tell the Court. ED is just seeking time in different matters. Arvind Kejriwal has been acquitted; it means that the Court has accepted that the ED case was not even right. I think, at a time when a judge gives a good decision, they are transferred immediately. Such a decision coming in is a big thing for India's judicial system.\"\nTerming the verdict a \"victory of truth,\" AAP Chief National Spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said, \"This is the victory of truth. It is evidence of the fact that Arvind Kejriwal is an honest leader. Each and every leader of AAP is honest. Court said that the summons sent by ED is illegal. Before this, PMLA Court said that the ED was acting out of malice. Bail was granted to Arvind Kejriwal. While granting bail to Arvind Kejriwal, Supreme Court had said that there is not enough evidence against him. BJP, along with its acquaintance - ED, drafted this case in its office. This was a case to defame Arvind Kejriwal. They wanted to arrest him because BJP wanted to come to power in Delhi.\"\nMeanwhile, the court also dealt with the allegations of willful disobedience by Arvind Kejriwal and said, \"The next challenge was to prove the accused's intentional disobedience, which the complainant has not proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\"This Court is of the considered opinion that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and the accused person is entitled to be exonerated of the charge against him in the present case. Accordingly, the accused Sh. Arvind Kejriwal is hereby acquitted of the offence punishable under Section 174 IPC,\" ACJM ordered.\nWhile discharging MLA Amanatullah Khan, the ACJM Paras Dalal said, \"This Court is of the considered opinion that the complainant has failed to prima facie show the ingredients of the alleged offence, and that the allegations are groundless.\"\n\"Accordingly, the accused Amantullah Khan is hereby directed to be released as per the proviso to Section 274 of the BNSS, the effect of which is discharge in the eyes of the law,\" the court held.\nSenior advocate N Hariharan and Rebecca John appeared for Arvind Kejriwal. Advocate Rajat Bhardwaj had appeared for Amanatullah Khan.\nOn the other side, Special public prosecutors N K Matta, Simon Benjamin alongwith Faizan Khan appeared for the Enforcement Directorate.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",
