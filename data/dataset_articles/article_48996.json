  "text": "Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said ‘bureaucracies’ such as the HHS became ‘wasteful and inefficient.’ The United States government has undergone a major shakeup since Donald Trump took office. Earlier this year, diversity, equity and inclusion ( DEI ) programs were slashed, and, most recently, the Department of Health and Human Services announced layoffs in an attempt to “restructure” the system. The department’s new secretary , Robert F. Kennedy Jr ., said that the HHS became “wasteful and inefficient” in a statement shared via the department’s website . “Over time, bureaucracies like HHS become wasteful and inefficient even when most of their staff are dedicated and competent civil servants,” Kennedy said in the statement. “This overhaul will be a win-win for taxpayers and for those that HHS serves. That’s the entire American public, because our goal is to make America healthy again.” Below, learn how many HHS employees will be laid off. There were 82,000 full-time employees that worked for the Health and Human Services Department, according to its website. So far, 10,000 employees have left the department voluntarily, according to CNN , but there will be a total of 20,000 job cuts in the end. The HHS noted on its website that the “restructuring” will downsize the division from 82,000 full-time employees to 62,000. The HHS noted that the reduction in workforce will “serve multiple goals without impacting critical services” and “save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year through a reduction in workforce.” “We aren’t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” RFK Jr. said in a statement. “This department will do more – a lot more – at a lower cost to the taxpayer.” Additionally, the HHS plans to jettison “many redundant units,” noting that its existing 28 divisions will be reduced to 15, including a “new Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, and will centralize core functions such as Human Resources, Information Technology, Procurement, External Affairs, and Policy.” The restructuring is also part of the goal to implement the HHS’ “new priority” to end “America’s epidemic of chronic illness by focusing on safe, wholesome food, clean water and the elimination of environmental toxins,” according to the department’s website.",
