  "text": "A friend of President Trump’s youngest son, Barron, said that he saved her life by calling the police when he saw her getting beat up by a man during a FaceTime call.\nA transcript of the emergency call was shared during suspect Matvei Rumiantsev’s trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London on Thursday, CNN reported.\nOn Jan. 18, 2025, Trump phoned British emergency services around 2:32 a.m., after he allegedly saw Rumiantsev, a 22-year-old Russian citizen, strike a friend he’d been on a video call with.\n“I just got a call from a girl I know,” he told dispatchers, per British media. “She’s getting beaten up.”\nTrump then provided his address before again telling the operator: “It’s really an emergency, please. I got a call from her with a guy beating her up.”\nThe court on Thursday also saw bodycam footage of the moment authorities arrived on the scene to help, The Independent reported. Officers tell the woman, who has not been identified, they were contacted by someone in the United States, who expressed their concern.\n“I am friends with Barron Trump, Donald Trump’s son,” she told authorities.\n An officer at one point can be heard telling another cop: “So apparently this informant from America is likely to be Donald Trump’s son.”\nRumiantsev was allegedly jealous of Trump’s relationship with the woman and became angry when he tried to phone her earlier in the evening, prosecutors said.\nThe woman during cross examination testified that she may not be here had Trump not intervened.\n“He helped save my life,” she said. “That call was like a sign from God at that moment.”\nRumiantsev is accused of assault, actual bodily harm, two counts of rape, intentional strangulation and perverting the course of justice. He denied all charges against him.",
