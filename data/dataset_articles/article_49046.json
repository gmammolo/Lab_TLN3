  "text": "2023 closes with a southern economy marked by positive economic signs and a general resilience of businesses. These are the words of the annual economic analysis by Confindustria and SRM, the research centre linked to the Intesa Sanpaolo Group. The Southern Economic Synthetic Index for 2023 grew for the third year in a row and rose by 8.8 points. The estimate of the figure for investments in the South is very positive, +4 percentage points compared to 2022 and 17 compared to 2019, \"confirming a dynamic that certainly needs to be strengthened\". The contribution of exports was particularly significant, +40 points on 2019.\nIn 2024, GDP growth in the South is estimated at +0.6%. This is the forecast of the annual survey by Confindustria and Srm, the research centre linked to Intesa SanPaolo. \"The confirmation of this data,\" the study explains, \"will be considerably influenced by the actual \"grounding\" of the available resources, primarily those related to the PNRR. Employment, recorded in the third quarter, increased by 4% compared to last year, with a greater increase for the South; but the increase in employment does not correspond to a significant progress in absolute terms if the data are compared to the share of those living in the South.\nThe analysis of Confindustria Srm indicates at least three major development factors on which the South must grow. These are the so-called \"3Cs\": Skills (from training to innovation), Connectivity (through adequate road, rail, port and air connection infrastructures, but also and above all digital and technological) and Competitiveness of companies (first and foremost in terms of entrepreneurial density and intensity). We therefore need an industrial policy that, by exploiting the considerable resources available - European and national - can create an environment favourable to the growth of territories and businesses in the South and, at the same time, enhance their production potential. In this context, a central role will be played by the PNRR, whose reshaping is highly anticipated news.\nOf the approximately €14 billion of new measures and additional resources in the Plan, about €12 billion are earmarked for businesses: €6.3 billion for Transition 5.0, €2.5 billion for green and net zero technologies supply chains, €2 billion for agri-food chain development contracts, €852 million for agri-solar parks, €320 million for support for green investments and €50 million for critical raw materials. These are positive signs of attention to the production system, but these will have to be declined while ensuring compliance with the original vocation of the Plan, i.e. working on reducing gaps. In this sense, it will be important to respect the clause for the allocation of 40% of the resources that can be allocated territorially to the South.\nStill on the policy and resources front, important innovations are expected from the new Single Special Economic Zone (SEZ) for the South and the revision of the Development and Cohesion Fund (FSC), both subject to the Southern Decree. The Single SEZ can represent a great potential for the South, but it will have to be declined carefully, so as not to frustrate its scope. Making the whole of Southern Italy a Special Economic Zone is an ambitious project, but it needs to be supported by a medium-term strategic plan. Recent measures dedicated to the South also intervene on national cohesion policy, making changes to the operation and governance of the Development and Cohesion Fund, to improve its spending performance. It will be important not to distort the nature of the Fund, preserving its characteristics of additionality and territorial allocation, which allocates 80% of resources to the South. More generally, it is necessary that the projects and resources defined by the amendments to the PNRR and the Southern Decree now see a timely implementation that, from the early stages, puts business investments at the center and ensures the involvement of all actors, first and foremost the economic and social partnership\nAll rights reserved © Copyright ANSA",
