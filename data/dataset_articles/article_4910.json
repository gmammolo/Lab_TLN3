  "text": "The Vanessa Pettigrew Bryan Equal Justice Award was awarded to Beverly Richardson on Dec. 18, 2025, in Franklin. Richardson is a forensic social worker with the 21st Judicial District Public Defender’s Office of Williamson County.\nHer accomplishments as a social worker exemplify Bryan’s discipline that a comprehensive approach of relief should be available to everyone regardless of financial affordability and that all avenues of relief should be examined for the benefit of the individual and society.\nThe event was the third anniversary of the award, which was created after Bryan’s retirement as elected Public Defender of the 21st Judicial District and for her prior service as Williamson County’s first full-time magistrate. Prior recipients include former 21st District Circuit Judge Michael W. Binkley and retired Assistant Public Defender Susan Logan.",
