  "text": "ICYMI: Murder Rate Plunges to 125-Year Low as President Trump Restores Law and Order\nUnder President Donald J. Trump’s leadership, America is safer than it has been in over a century — and brand new data proves it. A new report shows the murder rate across the nation’s biggest cities plummeted last year to its lowest level since at least 1900, marking the biggest one-year drop in recorded history.\nThis monumental turnaround is a direct result of President Trump’s unwavering commitment to Make America Safe Again. In addition to the historic drop in murders last year, the nation experienced steep declines in rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, shooting deaths (fewest since 2015), on-duty law enforcement officer deaths (80-year low), traffic fatalities, and overdose deaths.\nPresident Trump is reversing the chaos and carnage unleashed by Radical Left Democrats who turned our streets into war zones by coddling criminals and opening our borders. Since taking office, President Trump has deployed a whole-of-government offensive in Democrat-run cities, driving down crime, ridding the streets of savage criminal illegal aliens, backing law enforcement, and bringing back order where incompetent Democrat politicians surrendered to anarchy and despair.\nPresident Trump’s proven America First agenda is delivering real results for American citizens, proving once and for all that strength and resolve win out over weakness and wokeness — and the results are only just beginning.",
