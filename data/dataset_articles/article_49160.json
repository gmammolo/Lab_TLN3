  "text": "Karnataka Higher Education Minister Dr M C Sudhakar on Friday announced that the government has agreed to hike the salaries of guest lecturers in engineering, technical, and polytechnic colleges by Rs 5,000. The announcement was made almost a month after guest lecturers suspended teaching over a host of demands.\nThe government has also agreed to accord a one-day paid leave to guest lecturers in a month subject to certain conditions.\nThe higher education department has also decided to create a centralised database of documents, thus eliminating the need to invite applications for guest lecturer posts every year and undertake document verification during the selection process.\nThe guest lecturers had demanded the granting of service weightage under the rules of appointment of assistant professors.\nHowever, in view of the decisions of the Supreme Court and the Karnataka Administrative Tribunal (KAT), the government has decided to grant a service weightage of 1 per cent for every year subject to a maximum of 5 per cent to those who have rendered a minimum of five years of service.\nFurther, the state government has agreed to pay a consolidated sum of Rs 50,000 for every year served by a guest lecturer with more than 10 years of experience.\nTo avail health insurance of Rs 5 lakh per annum, a guest lecturer will have to pay Rs 400 every month and an equal contribution will be made by the government.\nSudhakar told reporters, “The government along with the help of legal counsel and finance department has reviewed all the demands of the guest lecturers and has made efforts to address most of them. The implementation of all these benefits will be effective from January 2024. I humbly request the lecturers to report to duties from January 1 and resume teaching in the interest of students. If they do not comply, the government will be forced to take stringent action against the lecturers.”",
