  "text": "NORTH SMITHFIELD – If President Donald Trump signs the House and Senate approved federal spending package, funding for Rhode Island will include a $500,000 grant for improvements to the North Smithfield Police station.\nU.S. Congressman Gabe Amo announced this week that he secured $7,904,413 in federal Community Project Funding for Rhode Island’s First Congressional District in the spending plan, including funds for projects supporting clean water, law enforcement, public safety, and ocean innovation.\n“Fighting for Rhode Island is why I came to Washington, and I’m thrilled to deliver nearly $8 million in federal funding for local projects,” noted Amo in a release on the grants. “These transformative federal investments will improve public safety, support law enforcement, clean our drinking water and our rivers, and uplift the Blue Economy across our district. I am grateful to the community leaders who identified these projects and look forward to seeing these investments make a real difference for the safety, health, and resilience of Rhode Island’s First Congressional District.”\nThe $500,000 would go toward communications equipment at the Smithfield Road station, according to the release.\n“The project is an appropriate use of taxpayer funds because it will improve public safety in North Smithfield and the surrounding communities by enhancing law enforcement officers’ ability to efficiently communicate with each other, the public, and other law enforcement agencies,” noted Amo in a letter requesting the grant last year.\nThe news comes just as members of the North Smithfield Town Council prepare to receive more details on a plan for police station renovations, with a ballot question that would authorize the town to take out a bond for up to $9 million to complete the work headed before voters in a special election scheduled for Tuesday, Feb. 3.\nCouncilors expect to hear final costs and details of the work from management firm ECC Corporation and contractor Pariseau Builders at a public meeting on Thursday, Jan. 22, to be held starting at 7 p.m. at Town Hall at 83 Green St.\nAlso on the table for Thursday’s agenda are questions regarding how to fund the needed repairs, with councilors yet to weigh in on whether or not they hope to bond the full $9 million or use some of the town’s estimated $10 million in reserves.\nThe grant could come as a boost for the long debated project, set to convert the century-hold schoolhouse that serves as department headquarters into a modern station the also holds space for municipal court.\nOther projects to be funded as part of the package if the federal spending is signed in to law are as follows:\n$1,092,000 for the Middletown Sewer System Reconfiguration $1,092,000 for Reducing Lead in Drinking Water in Newport’s North End $1,031,000 for Providence River Debris Removal Project in East Providence $1,031,000 for RI SmartBay Persistent Undersea Monitoring Platform $966,000 for Bristol Police Department Interoperable Encrypted Radio $785,000 for Essential Technology and Equipment for Smithfield Police Department $450,000 for Police GO TEAM Enhancement and Expansion $343,413 for North Providence Sewer Lining $311,000 for Victim Advocacy and Police Support $303,000 for the Lincoln Police Department Purchase of Tasers and Virtual Reality Training",
