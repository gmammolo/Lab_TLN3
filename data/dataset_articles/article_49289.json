  "text": "Summary\n£12.85 up to £13.15 per hour - This isn’t stacking shelves. This is feeding families.\nAvailable Shifts:\n05:00am – 15:00pm ( 20 to 30 hours Contract)\n14.00pm – 00:00am ( 20 to 30 hours Contract)\n*Shift patterns may be subject to change dependent on the need of the business. This can be discussed at interview stage\nAs a Customer Assistant at Lidl, no shift is the same and you get out what you put in. Starting at 5am some days to set up the store bakery for the day or finishing at 11pm on others to close the store and ensure the store is ready for another day of customers, you’ll keep moving and keep business booming. Every day is different, so you won’t just be working deliveries or working on the till; you’ll be doing all of it and more. You could even train to be a freshness specialist, non-food specialist or a bakery specialist. It’s your hard graft that puts food onto dinner tables and keeps our customers coming back.\nOur Customer Assistants work together as a team to ensure their store is clean, tidy and well-ordered so that customers can get the products they love and need. You’ll be part of a close-knit team who will soon become friends. Shifts include the weekends, but whether you have family commitments, are studying or have an extraordinary hobby, we make sure our rotas are available 3 weeks in advance so you can get the most out of your days off.

The process will include a telephone interview and face-to-face selection event. We look forward to receiving your application.\nWhat you'll do\n- Unpack stock as deliveries arrive in store\n- Providing excellent customer service on the tills\n- Help our customers with any questions or queries, and locate items around the store\n- Ensure the bakery stays topped up by baking fresh goods\n- Ensure shelves are looking good, checking for sell by dates, ensuring quality and freshness for our customers\n- Merchandising and maintaining our middles aisles of non-food products\nWhat you'll need\n- Some experience of working in a fast-paced environment\n- The flexibility to start an early shift at 5am or finish a late shift at 11pm\n- The ability to react positively to changing priorities\n- The initiative to identify tasks that need to be completed\n- The drive to work hard and contribute to the success of your store\n- A friendly communication style with your team and customers\n- Experience in providing excellent customer service\nWhat you'll receive\nThis isn't getting by. This is getting what you deserve.
