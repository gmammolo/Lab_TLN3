  "text": "AMBER Alert leads to safe return of Minnesota girl, man arrested\nZIMMERMAN, Minn. (KVRR) — A man is jailed in Sherburne County, Minnesota for abducting a 7-year-old girl on Wednesday in Zimmerman.\nThe sheriff’s office says 28-year-old Joseph Bragg, who has no permanent address, took the girl around 4 p.m when she got off the bus.\nShe wasn’t reported missing until 6:30 and eventually an AMBER Alert was issued.\nInvestigators identified a white Dodge Ram pickup as a suspect vehicle.\nAround 1 a.m., Bragg was stopped on I-35 in Freeborn County in far southern Minnesota and the girl was rescued.\nShe was checked out at a hospital and reunited with her family.\nThe sheriff thanked the hundreds of volunteers who came out to assist in the search.",
