  "text": "RALEIGH – Microsoft is going to bring 500 jobs to the Triangle with an average wage of $125,000. That’s more than double the average Wake County wage.\nThe tech giant has reached an agreement with the state of North Carolina to create that many jobs by 2023 and will in return receive tax benefits of more than $12 million spread over 12 years if job targets are met.\n“Microsoft is excited for the opportunities ahead in North Carolina,” said Reggie Isaac, US Citizenship Lead for Economic Development at Microsoft, said in a statement. “We look forward to growing our workforce in Wake County, and expanding our ability to both drive innovation and serve employees, customers and partners in the community.”\nMicrosoft will invest more than $47 million in the expansion of its operation in Morrisville.\nThe agreement was approved formally by the North Carolina Department of Commerce at a meeting Tuesday morning and later announced by Gov. Roy Cooper.\nIt’s the second time in three months that Microsoft has chosen to expand in North Carolina. A 430-job boost was announced in Charlotte in October.\n“Companies like Microsoft continue to expand in North Carolina because they see us as the right fit for technology success. Skilled, diverse workers and strong infrastructure mean businesses are confident that expanding in our state is a good business decision,” Cooper said.\nMicrosoft employs nearly 2,000 people in North Carolina with more than 1,400 being located in Charlotte.",
