  "text": "Audio By Carbonatix\nGCB Bank has restated its unwavering commitment to the protection of customer funds and the security of its banking systems, following reports of an alleged ATM-related fraud matter currently before the courts.\nThe Bank operates a zero-tolerance policy towards financial crime and has implemented robust security infrastructure, real-time transaction monitoring systems, and strict internal controls to prevent, detect and respond swiftly to suspicious activity across all its banking channels.\nGCB continues to work closely with state security agencies to investigate and prosecute suspected offenders. The Bank notes that these collaborative efforts have been instrumental in ensuring that attempted fraud cases are promptly detected and escalated, thereby reinforcing public confidence in the security frameworks established by GCB.\nCommenting on the issue, Theophilus Aryee, Chief Risk Officer of GCB Bank, said the safety of customers’ funds remains non-negotiable. He noted that the Bank continuously invests in people, processes and technology to stay ahead of evolving risks. He added that GCB’s strengthened collaboration with security agencies ensures that perpetrators are identified, frustrated and dealt with in accordance with the law, creating a more robust framework to address emerging threats.\nAs part of its preventive measures, GCB is intensifying customer education on safe banking practices. Customers are being advised to safeguard their ATM cards and PINs, avoid third-party assistance at ATM terminals and in banking halls, and promptly report lost cards or suspicious transactions through the Bank’s official channels or its Customer Experience hotline on 0800 422 422.\nGCB Bank is Ghana’s largest indigenous bank, with a nationwide branch network supported by comprehensive digital banking solutions. Established in 1953, the Bank serves individuals, SMEs, corporates and institutions, guided by its brand promise, Your Bank for Life.",
