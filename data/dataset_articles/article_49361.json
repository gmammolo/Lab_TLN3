  "text": "The Minister of Labor, Gloria Ines Ramirez, announced that the minimum wage will increase by 12% by 2024, meaning workers will receive an additional $140,000, increasing from earnings of $1,160,000 to now $1,300,000. Following the announcement by the head of the Labor Department, the President of the Republic, Gustavo Petro, spoke, sending a message to businessmen, and proposing a new tax reform to “increase productive activity”. In this regard, the Unitary Central of Workers (CUT) celebrated the wage increase figures for 2024 announced by the President of the Republic, Gustavo Petro, which will contribute to the improvement of the purchasing power of Colombian workers. “It is not what we were thinking, but it is positive, because it regains some purchasing power; However, we register negatively the attitude of the business community, which does not want to recognize the efforts of the workers in terms of wages and their income, unfortunately they remain in extremely low positions,” said CUT President. Fabio Arias said. , Similarly, the CUT includes presidential declarations regarding demands from the Bank of the Republic to cut interest rates; Seek mechanisms to reduce rates for public services, especially electricity; Review taxes and review tax reform for clean energy and tourism, but especially seek an economic context and future that improves productivity and the state of the national productive system. Read Also: He wanted to get a visa for the United States, but he made a fatal mistake and denied: \"I don't know whether to laugh or cry.\" CUT will accompany the National Agreement Table for Productivity proposed by the National Government, which will work through its proposals and debates in informal consultation tables to improve the living conditions of Colombian workers. Fenalco also told about minimum wage FENALCO President Jaime Alberto Cabal called the unilateral decision by national government decree to increase the minimum wage by 12% a mistake for the reactivation of the economy. The commerce sector will be the first to suffer, as indeed reflected in the negative figures recorded throughout 2023. “Commerce is a sector that is, as a general rule, formal and which creates the largest number of minimum wage jobs in the country, a situation that makes it all the more sensitive to decisions taken today regarding minimum wages Is.” We warned, based on a study by the Bank of the Republic, that each percentage increase in the minimum wage, above inflation and productivity – in the case of last year, negative – implies a loss of about 72,000 jobs.",
