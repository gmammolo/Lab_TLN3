  "text": "ATLANTA — A [beloved MARTA bus driver's time ](/article/news/community/marta-bus-driver-celebrates-50-years/85-3993a35c-1ece-4586-b2d9-e1ded0f45a81)with the transit company has come to an end with the announcement of his retirement, but that does not mean he is leaving the company for good, according to a [Fulton County LinkedIn post.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fultoncountygovernment_mr-coy-dumas-jr-is-a-native-of-the-adamsville-activity-7130623004425814016-JaQC) Coy Dumas Jr. first swept our hearts with his dedication and service as a MARTA bus driver. He knew each and every one of his passengers on a first-name basis, always greeting them with a smile, and became the \"mainstay in his community.\" “Anyone who's driven a bus can tell you it is hard work. Mr. Dumas does it with a smile and a sense of pride that makes his customers and all who cross his path feel uplifted and inspired,\" MARTA General Manager and CEO Collie Greenwood previously said. Dumas first joined MARTA in 1972 as a bus driver running the routes of west Atlanta over the year before most recently driving for the West Lake Station on the BlueLine. The Adamsville native has carried approximately 2.8 million passengers since he began operating buses. He also boasts a spotless driving record, having driven over two million miles without an accident, the transit center said. MARTA said he will continue to train new drivers as a consultant after his retirement in November. He will officially start his consultant position in January. After mentoring countless drivers over the decades, the new role is only fitting. He will also continue to lead the mentorship program out of the Perry bus facility before his retirement. “Mr. Dumas is a consummate professional and one of the most loyal and generous people you’ll ever meet,” Greenwood said. “I thank him for his incredible dedication and service and celebrate all he’s done for MARTA and for the countless customers he’s moved through metro Atlanta over the past 51 years. I am delighted he will continue as a mentor for the next generation of operators.” After celebrating 50 years of Dumas' service, MARTA surprised him with a bus- with his picture on it and a special minibus to go along with it. They also honored him with digital billboards celebrating his service all around metro Atlanta. Atlanta City Council members at a November meeting decided to dedicate and celebrate Dumas' retirement by proclaiming Nov. 15, 2023, to be the Coy Dumas Jr. Appreciation Day in Fulton County.
