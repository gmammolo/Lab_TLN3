  "text": "A selfless [Grimsby](https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/grimsby-news/) woman who helps mature jobseekers land the career of their dreams has been awarded an MBE for her incredible services to the welfare of older people. For many years, Anne Brewster has played a key role as a 50-Plus Champion in the Department for Work and Pensions in northern Lincolnshire, and was last month appointed to cover the Humber region, as well as North and East Yorkshire, to help those aged over 50 climb back on the career ladder. Currently working across 18 Jobcentres, Anne has been recognised for her dedication to helping older people into employment with a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) award in this year's Honours List.

Speaking to BusinessLive previously, Anne said: “Employers tell me that they know the value, the skills and experience older workers can bring. Sometimes the recruitment practices or words used in job descriptions can put off this age group from applying so tools to consider this when recruiting are vital. “I would ask all businesses to consider signing the pledge to ensure you recruit from a wide talent pool. It is recognised that multi-generational workforces are seen to be more productive. They are great mentors to have in a business with their life experiences and skills built up over years.” “Many people leave their jobs because of caring responsibilities or their health including the menopause. Having a conversation with their employer can ensure support can be put in place such as reasonable adjustments or flexible working and the business can save money on recruiting and training someone new. Any business wanting to talk to the local Jobcentre recruitment team is welcome to pop into their local office.”",
