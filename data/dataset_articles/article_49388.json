  "text": "Since the pandemic and cost of living crisis hit, the UK’s working people have been demanding better. Staff in industries right across the economy – such as [healthcare](https://wordpress.bigissue.com/news/employment/what-happens-if-nurses-go-on-strike/), [rail travel and education](https://wordpress.bigissue.com/news/employment/rail-strike-action-summer-of-discontent-teachers-nhs/) – walked out of their workplaces to strike for better conditions and pay that keeps pace with inflation. For some, last year was the most significant period of industrial action in memory. Britain has had enough, and the received idea of unions as exclusively white, middle aged and male is changing. Now the government is trying to introduce ‘anti-strike’ legislation in the form of the [Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill](https://wordpress.bigissue.com/news/employment/what-is-the-strikes-minimum-service-levels-bill-and-why-are-trade-unions-saying-its-anti-strikes/), which would force workers in public sectors to maintain a skeleton staff and keep services going during strikes. Change a Big Issue vendor’s life this Christmas [by purchasing a Winter Support Kit](https://www.bigissue.com/christmas/). You’ll receive four copies of the magazine and create a brighter future for our vendors through Christmas and beyond Paul Nowak, general secretary for the Trades Union Congress (TUC), which supports more than 5.5 million people across 48 member unions, spoke to Big Issue about what’s next for the country’s workforce. How do you summarise 2023 for UK workers? It has been an unprecedented year, to be honest with you. I’ve been a trade union activist for over 30 years, been working at the TUC for over 20 years, and I think I’ve stood on more picket lines and attended more rallies and demonstrations in the last 12 months than I have in most of those 20 years put together.",
