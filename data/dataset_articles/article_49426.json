  "text": "A HARWICH GP has been taken out of “special measures” and has now been rated good. The announced inspection was carried out in September “to follow up on” the breaches of regulation found from the last unannounced inspection in August, 2022. The two previous breaches in regulations were the failure to ensure care and treatment was provided in a safe way to patients, and to establish “effective systems and processes” which met the fundamental standards of care. The report said the practice was now being taken “out of special measures” and announced the “conditions imposed on the provider’s registration” were to be removed. After reviewing patient records in line with data sharing, conducting staff interview, and a short site visit, the report said: “The way the practice was led and managed promoted the delivery of high-quality, patient-centred care”. “No breaches of regulations” were identified but the G.P practice was advised to continue to make improvements. In the ‘safe’, ‘effective’, ‘caring’, and ‘responsive’ categories, the surgery was rated as good. While, in the “well-led” category, the practice was labelled as “requires movement”. However, in 2022 - after last being inspected as good overall in 2017- the practice was rated as either inadequate or 'requires improvement' in all five categories. With three G.P doctors, the [practice](https://fronksroadsurgery.co.uk/) delivers “General Medical services” to a patient population of 4,800 and has a nursing team of five.
