  "text": "New Delhi: Delhi's latest crime data reveals a significant shift — cases of vehicle theft decreased in 2025, strengthening gains from the previous year that bucked a decade-and-a-half-long rising trend by recording a marginal decline.\nTired of too many ads? go ad free now For over 15 years, vehicle-related crimes had been the most persistent security headache of police, consistently climbing year after year. However, 2025 finally recorded a break in this trajectory, with cases dropping by 12.4% — from 39,976 in 2024 to 35,014. Last year also witnessed a reversal in the spike of general thefts and burglaries in 2024, with a double-digit percentage drop. Interestingly, almost all FIRs in such cases were registered online or electronically.\nThe most dramatic improvement was seen in burglary cases, which plummeted from 8,965 in 2024 to 6,617 the next year, a reduction of over 26%, special CP (crime) Devesh Srivastava said. Top News Of The Day This downward trend was also seen in cases of house theft, which fell from 20,046 to 16,246, a nearly 19% decrease. This indicates a significant strengthening of residential perimeters and more effective night patrolling. The broad category of various ‘other thefts', which accounts for the highest volume of crimes reported in Delhi, saw the biggest decrease in terms of numbers: 14,657 fewer cases were registered in 2025 compared with 117,563 in 2024, translating to a 12.4% drop.\nThis reflects positive steps taken by police to ensure a more secure urban environment, while also suggesting that strategic deployment of technology in curbing crime and increased community policing finally started to bear fruit. The reduction in the number of vehicle thefts is significant, considering Delhi-NCR is India's vehicle theft hotspot. It accounts for over 56% of national cases, with a theft taking in the capital every 14 minutes.\nTired of too many ads? go ad free now In 2011, the number of such cases reported stood at 14,668, but by 2023, the figure had skyrocketed to 40,045 — a nearly 173% increase. This upward trajectory suggested that even as cities expanded and the density of parked vehicles increased, traditional policing methods often struggled to keep pace with the innovative ways sophisticated criminal gangs. Scarcity of secure parking spaces in Delhi often forces owners of luxury cars to park along its roads, making it easier for criminals to use advanced scanning tools and bypass in-built vehicle security systems. The legal landscape complicates deterrence. Offenders are rarely caught quickly and often exploit \"compoundable\" laws to secure quick release from jails and recidivate. Beyond individual losses, the crime, which has assumed epidemic proportions has a broader economic impact: insurance premiums rise for vehicle owners, increasing a collective financial burden. To cope with this seemingly overwhelming situation, Delhi Police pivoted toward digital solutions a decade ago, launching a specialised online application system for lodging reports of vehicle theft. This was designed to streamline the process. By automating the documentation required to process insurance claims, this effectively decoupled bureaucratic needs of a victim from active investigative duties of police.\nAbout the Author Raj Shekhar Jha Raj Shekhar Jha is a journalist for the Times of India with over a decade of experience in reporting on national security, terrorism, crime and prisons.\nEnd of Article Follow Us On Social Media",
