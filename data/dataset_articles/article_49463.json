  "text": "News\nNSCDC decorates 1,000 promoted officers in FCT\nThe Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, Federal Capital Terrritory, FCT, Command has decorated about 1,000 newly promoted officers.\nThe decoration took place at headquarters of the Command in Abuja, during its 2023 end of year fiesta.\nThe officers were among 21,000 personnel promoted out of the 29,000 that wrote promotion examinations.\nThe Commandant-General of the Corps, Dr Ahmed Audi sought their promotion on the grounds of prolonged stagnation many officers faced over the years.\nFollowing the examinations, the Minister of Interior, Dr Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, and the promotion board approved the promotion of 21,000 personnel.\nThe Commandant of the FCT Command,Olusola Odumosu applauded the Minister of Interior and the commandant general for facilitating the promotions.\nHe encouraged the newly decorated officers to exhibit diligence in their duties, reassuring those who did not receive promotions that efforts are underway to address existing promotion backlogs.\nThose promoted include five senior officers advancing from Assistant Commandants to Deputy Commandants, and over 20 officers progressing from Chief Superintendents to Assistant Commandants.",
