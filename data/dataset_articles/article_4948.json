  "text": "…Says PINL has changed hoodlums who caused state of emergency in Rivers State to good\nBombings of oil facilities in a part of Ogoni are said to be the turning point that convinced the Federal Government to declare state of emergency in Rivers State. Now, a monarch from the area has affirmed that the hoodlums that embarked on that mission are now good citizens.\nThis was the highpoint of the first edition of the stakeholders’ forum of the oil pipeline host communities of Rivers State, Bayelsa, Imo, and Abia states in Port Harcourt Thursday, January 22, 2026. The forum was mounted by the Pipeline Infrastructure Nigeria Limited (PINL) which protects pipelines and oil installations in the Eastern Corridor.\nJohn Berebom, the paramount ruler of Bodo in Gokana LGA of Rivers State, in his goodwill message at the event, said it was the bombings in Bodo area of the state that attracted state of emergency, but admitted that when PINL officials came in and calmed things down, the state knew peace again.\nHe marveled at the methods of PINL, saying the company does things differently, and that their December 2025 package to the communities was not only unsolicited but attractive. “Now, those sometimes referred to as bad boys are now turning a good leaf.”\nPeter Nwagbara, paramount ruler of Elele-Alimini He said: “Many will recall that it was the things that happened in Bodo (oil facility bombing) that led to state of emergency, but PINL came in and put a stop to it, and when the atmosphere changed, the state of emergency was lifted.”\nBerebom made few appeals, urging PINL to expand the communities to benefit so that clusters can be assisted, whether every community has pipelines or not. He said those nearby communities not involved have turned to big threats to the oil facilities. “If only pipeline host communities are made to enjoy and the other nearby ones are ignored, they could constitute nuisance and threat.”\nAnother appeal was for the NNPC to increase their package to PINL to support to do more to calm down the communities.\nSpeaking in the same vein, Peter Wagbara, a retired police commissioner and now the paramount ruler of Elele Alimini, commended the management of PINL, testifying that the group was not towing the path of the oil majors (IOCs) in relating with the communities.\nHe said: “PINL is not using divide and rule system like oil majors, and they are not using tricks and intrigues. For an example, I have got weary of applying to oil companies to support our football fiesta knowing that when the youths are engaged in fiestas, they think less of violent crimes. None of the IOCs even replied our letters.\n“But as I talk with you now, the moment I wrote to PINL, the response was prompt. They even came calling. I can thus confirm that they mean well for our people. For them to recognize football as a proven tool for youth mobilization means they know their onions.”\nOn their own, the Ekpeye group from Ahoada, led by Patricia Ogbonnaya, the Ada Ekpeye Logbo II, and other chiefs, said PINL officials have good hearts and clean minds.\nIn his presentation, Akponime Omojevwhe, Head of Field Operations, Eastern Corridor, Project Monitoring Office (PMO NNPCL), said NNPCL believes that community partnership is national security. He said the outcomes of 2025 have proved that when communities are included, respected, and empowered, the results speak for themselves.\nHe stated: “The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited recorded a profit after tax of ₦502bn in November 2025, following increased gas output, full pipeline availability, and others.\n“Figures from the NNPC Monthly Financial and Operations Report for November 2025, released on Wednesday, showed that the national oil company generated ₦4.36tn in revenue during the month, reflecting a marginal increase compared with October.\n“The improved performance was attributed to stronger gas output, full pipeline availability, and steady domestic fuel supply, which helped offset challenges in crude oil production.”\nHe said: “This tells us one clear story: every barrel protected matter, and every community that safeguards hydrocarbon infrastructure contributes directly to national development.\n“While revenues remain strong, there is need to sustain same. Hence, pipeline security is not optional, it is existential.”",
