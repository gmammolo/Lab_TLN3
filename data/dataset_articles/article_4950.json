  "text": "This hidden gem crime thriller on Netflix is one of the most critically acclaimed movies on the platform. Sporting a near-perfect Rotten Tomatoes score, this surprise breakout hit is widely considered one of the best original Netflix thriller movies of the 2020s.\nFeaturing a breakout performance by star protagonist Aaron Pierre, along with one of Don Johnson's career-best villain roles, this gripping Netflix action thriller has all the ingredients of a modern streaming hit. If you haven't seen this movie yet, it's one you don't want to miss.\nRebel Ridge Is A Must-Watch Hidden Gem Crime Thriller\nRebel Ridge is a must-watch Netflix original action thriller. Released under the radar in 2024, the film was written and directed by Jeremy Saulnier, best known for his previous films like Blue Ruin and Green Room.\nRebel Ridge begins with an intense and simple premise that will hook you from the very first scene. Pierre's protagonist, Terry Richmond, is a former Marine who gets stopped by police in a small Louisiana town. The cops search him and discover a large sum of cash, meant to be bail money for Terry's cousin. After the cops hang onto the money, Terry goes on a one-man-army tour of revenge.\nRebel Ridge is about as lean as a modern action crime thriller movie can get. With a runtime of 2 hours and 11 minutes, this film absolutely flies by thanks to Pierre's magnetic performance and strong motivation against a corrupt system. Not only will you find it easy to root for Terry as he fights back for what was stolen from him, but you'll have a great time watching his expert and creative methods of combat.\nRebel Ridge Is Perfect To Watch On Netflix After The Rip\nRebel Ridge immediately drew comparisons to Prime Video's viral series Reacher when it was released, but it also makes a perfect follow-up movie to Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's new Netflix crime thriller The Rip. Between the high-octane action, corrupt cops, and a large cash sum up for grabs, Rebel Ridge and The Rip have a lot of great things in common.\nWhile you can always re-watch Affleck and Damon classics like Good Will Hunting and Air, or Boston crime masterpieces like The Departed or The Town, after streaming The Rip, Rebel Ridge offers more of the same tension, suspense, and action thrills with new faces in a different setting.\nBased on Rebel Ridge's Certfied Fresh 95% Rotten Tomatoes score, compared to The Rip's 81% RT score, you can safely say that Rebel Ridge is an even better thriller movie than Netflix's #1 worldwide hit right now. Fortunately, there's no need to compare the two films, as both are great streaming options for action thriller fans on Netflix.\nYour comment has not been saved\nRebel Ridge\n- Release Date\n- September 6, 2024\n- Runtime\n- 131 Minutes\n- Director\n- Jeremy Saulnier\n- Writers\n- Jeremy Saulnier\nCast\n-\nAaron PierreTerry Richmond\n-\nOfficer Evan Marston",
