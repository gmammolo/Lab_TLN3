  "text": "CBS LA: 2025’s Might Be the Lowest Murder Rate in the U.S. Since 1900 as It Drops 21% Last Year\n‘And here in LA murders dropped by 39%’\nEXCERPT:\nTURK: “Murders plummeted 21 percent in the U.S. last year, which is the largest drop in a single year ever recorded. Researchers believe it might be the overall lowest murder rate in the U.S. since 1900. And here in L.A., murders dropped by 39 percent. Researchers on the Council on Criminal Justice looked at a total of 40 major cities and found that carjackings and shoplifting also went down. But overall, drug offenses were the only category that went up.”",
