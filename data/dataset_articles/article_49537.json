  "text": "Deputy General Secretary of the Barbados Workers’ Union, Dwaine Paul, has announced significant advancements following a successful lobby with the Caribbean Aircraft Handling (CAH) team.\nThese improvements encompass the regularization of over 100 workers from part-time to full-time employment, retroactive pay adjustments, salary increases in line with government standards, and revisions to terms and conditions pertaining to uniforms and other areas.\nPaul highlighted the significance of these achievements, stating, “As part of the airport group’s ongoing efforts, there’s a commitment to bring better and greater things to the entire airport family in 2024.” This statement underscores the union’s dedication to continuous improvement and advocacy for employees.\nPresident of the CAH division, Jason Layne expressed profound gratitude towards the Barbados Workers’ Union for their pivotal role in resolving major issues at the airport.\nLayne remarked, “This development marks a significant step towards ensuring that the company is invested in the workers as much as the workers are in them.” This sentiment reflects a mutual commitment to the well-being and satisfaction of the workforce.\nFurther, the President called upon more workers to come together in the quest for bigger and greater achievements in the future, emphasizing the importance of unity and collaboration for continued progress.\n(PR)",
