  "text": "Oluchi Chibuzor Uber and Travelstarts have reiterated their commitments to ensure that drivers continue to improve earning and more discount inview of the economic challenges facing the economy. Speaking at Uber Driver Appreciation event in Lagos, the Country Manager, Uber, Nigeria, Tope Akinwumi, said, the company recognise that drivers have faced hurdles this year due to the economic challenges. He also said their resilience and dedication have been exceptional, adding drivers have remained committed to providing reliable service, particularly during these challenging times. At the event which saw some drivers being rewarded with different prizes, Akinwumi, said that Uber remained steadfast in its commitment to providing drivers with sustainable earning opportunities and has significantly invested in key safety measures. According to him, “As we approach the end of this year, Uber remains committed to supporting the drivers who operate on the App, enhancing safety measures, and fostering an environment where excellence thrives. We look forward to continuing this journey together into the new year. “A lot of macro-economic challenges that we had, fuel crisis are going up by almost 200 percent. FX issues, inflation even with that we have seen growth because people need to move, parcels need to move from one point to the other. Our fingers crossed that next year will be a much better year, we will keep innovating and finding cheaper ways for people to move around.” However, for the Country Manager, Travelstart Nigeria, Bukky Akomolafe, “The ultimate reward is seeing drivers and riders winning flights, enjoying ride discounts, and feeling celebrated. The dedication of Nigerians is what fuels our partnership with Uber, and we will keep seeking ways to create cost savings and ease for our country’s travelers. Stay tuned, we will be announcing another engagement soon.”",
