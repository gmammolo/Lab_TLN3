  "text": "The man leading a project bringing tens of thousands of new jobs to the East Midlands says a \"seamless transport network\" is needed to make it a success. Improvements to the M1 and plans to extend Nottingham's tram network are among the initiatives which the East Midlands Freeport CEO says will be \"really important\" in making it work. The East Midlands is one of just eight areas across England that the Government has chosen to host a freeport, with the project estimated to bring in hundreds of millions of pounds to the region in the coming decades. The aim is that this money will be re-invested to tackle the \"pockets of deprivation\" that exist in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire. Having become operational in March, the East Midlands Freeport is already witnessing overseas businesses choosing to base themselves in the region. But Tom Newman-Taylor, the CEO of the Freeport, says further Government investment will be needed on top of the £25 million that has initially been secured for the project. Do you support plans to extend Nottingham's tram network? [Let us know here.](https://xd.wayin.com/display/container/dc/a84e9ea1-98c0-40d3-89fc-6959caea448a/entry) A freeport is a defined geographical area containing sites which can offer businesses major tax discounts compared to what they would normally be charged. The aim is to attract new investors into the UK and for high-quality jobs to follow, with the Freeport team already in constant dialogue with overseas businesses about basing themselves here. The East Midlands Freeport zone, the only inland freeport in the UK, contains three tax sites which are fixed and set out in law. They include its primary site at the East Midlands Airport and Gateway Cluster, land at [Ratcliffe-on-Soar](https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/new-plans-future-nottinghamshires-last-8770694) around the soon-to-be closed power station and the East Midlands Intermodal Park in Derbyshire, near Toyota's major manufacturing plant. Support given to companies who base themselves at these three sites will include relief from any business rates for five years, relief from having to pay National Insurance contributions for three years and no stamp duty being charged on the purchase of any land or property within the sites. Activity has already included parts of the SEGRO Logistics Park near the [East Midlands Airport,](https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/east-midlands-airport) a 700-acre development of logistics accommodation that gives businesses ranging from Amazon to DHL direct access to a rail freight terminal. But despite his belief in the potential of the East Midlands Freeport, Mr Newman-Taylor said: \"In order to create those tens of thousands of jobs and bring in that investment, we need a seamless transport network. We need the M1 and the major road arteries to work effectively. \"I'm talking to partners across the region about making sure that we shout with the loudest voice when it comes to securing that investment because that is a key part of making it a success. It is absolutely true that the East Midlands has received less than its fair share when it comes to Government investment. \"Part of what we try to do, working with regional partners, it to shout as loudly as possible back into Government to say that in order to make this work, we need the investment.\" As well as improvements to major road networks, Mr Newman-Taylor said the idea of extending the NET network to the Ratcliffe-on-Soar tax site would boost connectivity. The successful Freeport bid at Ratcliffe runs in parallel to broader redevelopment plans for the site when the power station closes next September. Potential projects include gigafactories producing electric cars, a research and development centre partnered with a local university and a small scale hotel. Alongside these plans, site operator Uniper says it will aim to increase its capacity for hydrogen production to 500MW by the end of the decade. These clean energy developments could then be used to power the businesses that choose to base themselves at the Freeport site. Although hoping to see improvements in the transport network, the East Midlands Freeport CEO therefore believes that the region has the best of all the freeport propositions in the country. Mr Newman-Taylor said: \"There's a really exciting proposition to build on in terms of being in the centre of the country, being connected by the UK's largest dedicated airfreight airport, our manufacturing heritage, our great cities and universities. \"That said, there are pockets of deprivation, there are areas where we under-perform as a region in terms of skills and productivity. What the Freeport is about is attracting in that investment and addressing some of those long-standing issues.\" The development land contained within the East Midlands Freeport overall is equivalent to around 1,000 football pitches. The businesses that the Freeport team are particularly interested in attracting to the tax sites include those in logistics, advanced manufacturing and air cargo transportation. As well as the specific tax sites, any major company is able to come forward and apply to be a customs site. Although not accessing the same level of tax breaks as those on the three major East Midlands Freeport sites, those in the customs zones still benefit from simplified import procedures and the suspension of certain duties. The Freeport plans are also separate to the East Midlands being chosen as one of 12 locations to host an ['investment zone.'](https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/exciting-opportunity-more-jobs-east-8249637) These zones are similar in design to freeports, but there are differences in terms of location and the tax benefits to businesses. Mr Newman-Taylor says there is work to be done to bring all these schemes together in one simple package that can be used to attract international businesses to the East Midlands. Although the tax benefits offered by the Freeport are limited, the CEO says the lifespan of the project should be measurable in decades. The Freeport boss also says that the plans will allow the East Midlands to compete with countries such as the US when it comes to attracting major employers. Already, the development at the SEGRO Logistics Park represents hundreds of millions of pounds worth of investment, with the operator of the rail freight terminal there in the process of doubling capacity. Mr Newman-Taylor added: \"By getting that investment in, the other thing that is not always that well understood is that we as a region get to keep hold of a big chunk of the tax uplift that would have gone back to the Treasury and Westminster. If we're doing our job correctly, we should be talking about extra hundreds of millions of pounds over the coming decades that we can then re-invest in the region.\"",
