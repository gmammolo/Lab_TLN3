  "text": "2023-12-30 13:17:34\nSelf-entrepreneurship is attractive, according to a latest study published this Friday by Ursaaf. The number of self-employed workers continued to increase in France in 2022 with an ever-increasing share of self-employed people. At the end of 2022, there were 4.3 million self-employed workers, an increase of 5.9% year-on-year. However, this number is growing less quickly than between 2018 and 2021 (from +7.9% to +8.6%), according to Urssaf.\nThe growth in the number of independent workers is “largely driven by that of self-employed people”, whose development is however running out of steam: +9.3% in 2022, after +15.3% in 2021 and +17.5% in 2020. “The self-employed status now represents 56.2% of all self-employed people,” underlines Urssaf in its study, noting that the proportion of women is still lower than that of men (nearly 42% compared to 58%). ). Nearly seven out of ten self-employed people declared a turnover in 2022.\nAn income that increases\nThe number of so-called “classic” self-employed workers increased by 1.5% for the second consecutive year, “after a period of almost uninterrupted decline since the creation of the self-employed status”. Their income increased in 2021, notes Urssaf, amounting to 45,581 euros per year on average (+8.3% including the effect of inflation compared to 2020). The average income of self-employed people reached 7,449 euros over one year in 2022 (up 8.9% compared to 2021, which saw an increase of 14.3% after catching up with the effects of the health crisis) .\nAs the Urssaf website reminds us, the self-employed person must declare their turnover every month or every quarter, even if it is zero. When it is positive, the self-employed person pays contributions and social contributions, as well as a business property tax, the amount of which varies depending on the turnover and the place of domiciliation of the company. The income of a self-employed person therefore corresponds to his turnover from which his contributions paid to Urssaf and professional charges are subtracted.\n1704000217\n#Among #independent #employees #selfentrepreneurship #appeals",
