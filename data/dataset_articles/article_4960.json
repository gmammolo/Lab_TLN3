  "text": "Partnership brings AI-powered revenue cycle management to Marin County’s Justice-Involved CalAIM program readiness initiative\nSAN FRANCISCO, CA, UNITED STATES, January 7, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — Health Roads, Inc., based in Newark, California, in partnership with Intrepid Ascent, Inc. of Berkeley, California, today announced the award of a contract with the Marin County Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide Third-Party Administrative (TPA) services for Justice-Involved CalAIM billing.\nUnder the California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal (CalAIM) initiative, the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) has directed all participating counties to expand services to include Justice-Involved (JI) populations — particularly individuals who are incarcerated, recently released, or transitioning back into the community. Beginning in 2025, DHCS requires counties and their contracted providers to demonstrate operational readiness for “pre-release” and “pre-entry” Medi-Cal services, ensuring that eligible members can access clinical care coordination, Enhanced Care Management (ECM), and Community Supports before discharge from correctional settings.\nThrough this collaboration, Marin County HHS will enhance its scalability, flexibility, and agility in implementing billing for the Justice-Involved pre-entry population, positioning the County to meet upcoming California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) requirements for CalAIM billing readiness across counties.\n“Marin County HHS is a progressive and innovative organization, and I believe our AI-enabled, flexible revenue cycle management product and services, named SocialRCM®, will offer significant value to the department,” said Rajib Ghosh, CEO of Health Roads.\n“Technology is a powerful catalyst, but people drive community change. With Health Roads, we are integrating their SocialRCM® platform and our stakeholder-led design to bring real, human-centered impact to Marin County as they are implementing the JI initiative,” said Danielle Carter, CEO of Intrepid Ascent.\nThe combined solution uses Health Roads’ SocialRCM®, an AI-powered revenue cycle management product and managed services platform, with Intrepid Ascent’s expertise in implementation, program design, and change management to help county teams and community-based organizations (CBOs) efficiently handle CalAIM Justice-Involved workflows, documentation, and claims submission.\nLooking ahead to 2025 and 2026, Health Roads and Intrepid Ascent plan to provide this integrated solution to other California counties that want to establish or expand Justice-Involved CalAIM services with a dependable TPA model.\nAbout Health Roads, LLC\nHealth Roads is a California-based health and social-care technology company focused on operational excellence and revenue cycle management for community-based and county health organizations. Its flagship solution, SocialRCM, combines AI-enabled workflows with expert services to help providers and public agencies improve documentation quality, claims accuracy, and reimbursement timeliness.\nAbout Intrepid Ascent\nIntrepid Ascent partners with counties, public agencies, and community-based organizations to design and implement practical, human-centered solutions that improve health and social outcomes. The firm brings deep expertise in interoperability, program implementation, and stakeholder facilitation across California’s safety-net ecosystem.\n___________________________________",
