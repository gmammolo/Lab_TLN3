  "text": "The Intel Corporation's January 2022 announcement of its plans to build a $20 billion computer chip manufacturing operation just south of Johnstown was clearly the top story of 2022 in Licking County. In 2023, the top stories were again Intel-related, as various developments began in preparation for the start of Intel production in 2025. Every developer mentions Intel at some point during the explanation of their plans. And there were several large land purchases, possibly for future developments.\nLeaders in every city, village and township in the county wondered how their community would fit in with the rapidly changing landscape and economy of Licking County. In Jersey Township, the massive earthmoving operation has replaced homes and farms, realigned streets and affected everyone in the immediate area.\nThe Intel development itself, on 1,000 acres of Jersey Township land since annexed into New Albany, has amazed anyone driving by on Mink Street and Green Chapel Road, or seen aerial views of the progress.\nThe development, which is the largest single private sector company investment in Ohio’s history , will include two four-story clean room buildings, connected by an underground tunnel.\nA September company tour showed massive excavation work for the basement levels of the two factory buildings, heavy construction equipment everywhere, miles of pipe awaiting installation, batch plants making concrete, several huge cranes, large hills of dirt, and temporary dirt roads to allow for movement of construction equipment. Intel had laid 16,000 cubic yards of concrete at that time.\nAEP is building a new substation just to serve the factory. The substation will be large enough to power 65 homes for a year.\nThe Intel site includes 250 acres set aside for suppliers . When Intel announced the project, it said it already had about 140 suppliers in Ohio, and about 30 of them were expected to locate around the plant.\nIntel expects to hire 3,000 full-time high-skilled employees to operate the factories, including 2,000 technicians, more than 700 engineers and up to 150 support workers. Hundreds more will work for regional semiconductor suppliers.\nThe move marks a major expansion of its data center service business that dates to 2015, when it announced its initial data centers for the region. Amazon did not say how many data centers it will build, or where they will be built, as part of the expansion. A single data center can cost at least several hundred million dollars.\nAmazon says it is considering numerous locations. The company bought nearly 400 acres along Beech Road NW, near the Intel site, for $116.6 million. It has not released any plans for the location.\nThe property had been owned by New Albany Company affiliate MBJ Holdings, which purchased it June 5.\nIn October, Microsoft also paid $30.65 million for 289 acres on the north side of Refugee Road between Mink Street and Etna Parkway in the Pataskala Corporate Park. The company did not say what exactly it planned for the Pataskala property, but suggested that it would also be for data centers.\nIn November, the village of Hebron hosted a public forum to discuss Microsoft's plans to buy more than 300 acres in the village and in Union Township to build data centers just west of THK Manufacturing. Outgoing Mayor Jim Layton said Microsoft's preliminary plan shows six data center buildings, with about 50 to 75 employees each, but phased in over about 10 years.\nThe Heath Planning Commission approved in October the zoning for a mixed-use development on 320 acres west of Walmart. On the same November night, the Heath City School Board and Heath City Council each approved a city-school district agreement for the development.\nThe Planned Unit Development zoning was approved for an area labeled Central Park, bordered by the Newark-Heath-Licking County Airport to the south, Geller Park and the railroad to the north, retailers like Walmart and Target to the east and Marathon tanks and Keller Drive to the west.\nThe special zoning allows for the creation of a community with areas for single-family homes, apartments, retail, restaurant, parks, assisted living, outdoor recreation, walking trails, government buildings and potential commercial/industrial space near the airport.\nIt would bring an estimated 300 students into the school district by the time it reaches full build-out in 2031. The housing offerings would include 218 single-family homes on 77 acres, 234 units of multifamily ranch housing, 156 units of townhomes and 1,228 apartments — for a total of 1,836 housing units.\nIlluminate USA expects to hire more than 1,000 employees by the time all eight lines are operating by the end of 2024.\nThroughout the fall, residents of Pataskala and beyond have packed Pataskala City Council meetings expressing concerns about LONGi and pleaded with Pataskala and the country as a whole to protect them from what they feel is an invasion by China. After months of hearing from residents for months, multiple council members spent more than 40 minutes addressing questions during the council's last meeting of the year on Dec. 5.\nAfter a 2022 decision by the Licking County Commissioners to expand the service area of the Southwest Licking Community Water and Sewer District, the utility district purchased nearly 100 acres in St. Albans Township for $4.6 million in March.\nThe district is moving forward with a wastewater treatment center on that St. Albans Township land.\nConstruction is also underway on Southwest Licking's new wastewater treatment plant , which will be located on 23 acres at 13057 National Road in Etna Township, near Mink Street. It was expected the plant would cost about $70 million, but District Board Member Trent Stepp said the cost is now expected to be about $85 million.\nOnce the SWLCWSD's expanded service area was approved, representatives for the Villages of Granville and Alexandria and City of Johnstown began exploring a regional partnership for water and sewer service to ensure they have a say in what future development looks like in central Licking County.\nIn mid-September, council's for the three municipalities approved memorandums of understanding that allowed the municipalities to keep working toward a regional partnership for utility service in the unincorporated areas of Granville, St. Albans, and Monroe Townships.\nAt the same time, all three councils also approved entering an agreement giving Granville and Johnstown the right of first refusal for any offers on Alexandria's water and wastewater infrastructure.\nSouthwest Licking had offered to assume debt service on Alexandria's wastewater plant, extend water and sewer service lines to the village by the second quarter of 2026 and provide other utility services.\nGranville and Johnstown submitted their own offer to the village, but out-going Alexandria Mayor Jim Jasper said in December the village was likely to reject both offers and keep the wastewater plant for now.\nPataskala will also add a 75-unit assisted living facility and 61 independent living villas after a plan was approved by the planning and zoning Commission on June 7.\nWork progressed this summer on The Overlook , 66-lot subdivision of mostly two-bedroom homes for older couples to be built on 25 acres of a 41-acre tract off Cherry Valley Road in Newark.\nBut those developments might not be enough to keep up with the housing demand expected with Intel. The county's single-family home building permits increased each year, from 398 in 2017 to 837 in 2021. But fell to 670 in 2022. Through eight months of 2023, the total number of approved permits for new home construction was at 320.\nDevelopers and builders have said increased prices for land and materials have reduced the profit margins. Inflation, interest rates and fears of a recession have also contributed to the slowdown, experts have said.\nAshley Furniture closes distribution center, sells building to Uline Less than three years after it was announced that Ashley Furniture Industries would bring a distribution hub to Etna Township, the furniture manufacturer closed the facility late in 2022.\nIn October 2020, JobsOhio announced Ashley Furniture would bring an estimated 300 jobs and would invest $70 million toward building the facility at 8320 Global Way S.W.\nEtna Township Trustee Rozland McKee said company officials told her the departure was for economic reasons.\nIn May, the building sold for $114.3 million to Uline , a Wisconsin-based company that distributes shipping, industrial and packaging materials.\nIt will be Uline's first fulfillment distribution center in Ohio, and the company expects to start operations in early 2025 after making renovations and upgrades that should be completed by late 2024\nkmallett@newarkadvocate.com\n740-973-4539\nTwitter: @kmallett1958\nmdevito@gannett.com\n740-607-2175\nTwitter: @MariaDeVito13",
