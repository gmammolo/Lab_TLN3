  "text": "Shawn Fain, president of the UAW, had a helluva year. He was so successful in getting concessions from the big three automakers, that [CNN added \"labor leader of the year\"](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/27/success/shawn-fain-labor-leader-of-year/index.html) to their \"CEO of the year\" honors, and handed the labor crown to Shawn. Other nominees were Teamsters Union President Sean O’Brien, and Fran Drescher, the president of SAG-AFTRA, who both won major concessions from their strikes in 2023 as well. Fain’s rhetoric was particularly harsh during the strike. He appeared on one of his Facebook Live talks announcing an expansion of the strike wearing an “Eat the Rich” T-shirt. He was accused of waging class warfare, and of making demands that would bankrupt companies. But soon after the deals, General Motors announced it had enough money to spend $10 billion in repurchasing shares of its stock to benefit its investors. The other automakers said they would remain profitable. Fain said he’s fine with the companies’ success, as long as his members get their fair share. Congratulations Unions! And a Crookie Good Guy award to Shawn Fain, who got the ball rolling.",
