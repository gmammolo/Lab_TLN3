  "text": "This is your chance to get a real taste of retail, as you're exposed to every facet of our business over the 12 months of your placement.\nDon’t be fooled by the word ‘Buying’ here. This large National department covers every aspect of the product lifecycle, from concept to shelf. You’ll choose from three specialisms; Corporate Responsibility, Quality Assurance and Marketing.\nYour time will be spent in that specific department, where you’ll work on personal and team projects, build relationships and solve problems in a complex environment. Yes, it can be daunting - but it is also a fantastic opportunity to learn and be inspired by a company that’s so different to all the others.\nReference: 50938550\nPlease note\nReed.co.uk does not communicate with candidates via Whatsapp, and we will never ask you to provide your bank, passport or driving licence details during the application process.
