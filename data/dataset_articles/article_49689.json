  "text": "ALBANY, New York — New York’s minimum wage workers had more than just the new year to celebrate on Monday, with a pay increase as the clock ticked down to 2024. In the first of a series of annual increases scheduled for the Empire State, the minimum wage rose to $16 in New York City and some of its suburbs, up from $15. In the rest of the state, the new minimum wage is $15, up from $14.20. The state’s minimum wage is expected to rise each year to reach $17 in New York City and its suburbs, and $16 in the rest of the state by 2026. Future increases will be tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Earners and Workers administrative. , a measure of inflation. New York is one of 22 states that will receive minimum wage increases in the new year, according to a recent report from the Economic Policy Institute. In California, the minimum wage increased to $16, up from $15.50, while in Connecticut it increased to $15.69 from the previous rate of $15. This latest wage increase in New York is part of an agreement reached last year between Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state legislature. The deal came despite objections from some employers, as well as some Liberal Democrats who said it was not high enough. The federal minimum wage in the United States has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009, but states and some localities are free to set higher amounts. Thirty states, including New Mexico and Washington, have done so.",
