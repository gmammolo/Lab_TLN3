  "text": "SPENCER, W.Va. — The Spencer Police Department reported robust enforcement activity, significant equipment upgrades, and steady community engagement throughout 2025, even while operating with a reduced staff for much of the year.\nMayor Terry Williams praised the department’s current trajectory.\n“We can’t be more pointed in the right direction,” Williams said.\nThe mayor added that officers remain closely connected to the local population.\n“They’re good to people and help people out a lot,” Williams said.\nThe department is currently staffed by Chief L. Todd Cole, Capt. Jeff Starcher, Sgt. C.J. Myers, and Patrolmen Ben Goodson, Hannah Ross, and Frank Dunkle, along with part-time Patrolman Kevin Unger. Lt. Greg Nichols resigned in November 2025 to join the Parkersburg Police Department, and another officer left earlier in the year for other employment. That vacancy was not filled.\nDespite these staffing challenges, the department recorded significant activity. Officers filed 479 criminal investigation reports in 2025, with approximately 97% of those cases cleared by arrest or exceptional means. Traffic violations accounted for nearly 60% of all report activity.\nShoplifting complaints totaled 25 reports, less than half the number recorded in 2024. Officials attributed the decline to improved prosecution of repeat offenders and stronger working relationships with local businesses. Property crimes—including burglary, breaking and entering, destruction of property, theft, and trespassing—accounted for 45 additional reports.\nMayor Williams said the results reflect the department’s professionalism.\n“I’m proud of them and proud of what they do,” Williams said.\nOne of the year’s most significant investigations involved Patrolman Ross, Lt. Nichols, and Sgt. Myers, who arrested an individual in possession of dozens of fraudulently obtained gift cards. Officers were alerted to the suspect at a Spencer retail store following an attempted return of property obtained through fraudulent means.\nThe suspect fled the scene, leading to a brief pursuit that ended when the vehicle became immobile after striking a curb. Officers recovered thousands of dollars in stolen retail merchandise, numerous fake identification cards, and dozens of gift cards. A total of $22,000 was seized from the vehicle.\nDue to the suspect’s history and possession of a fake passport identification card, the Department of Homeland Security partnered with the local department in the investigation.\nChief Cole also investigated a complaint from Roane County Board of Education Superintendent Michelle Stellato involving unpaid surplus technology devices. The equipment, valued at approximately $60,000, had been picked up in March 2025 following a bid award but was never paid for.\nAn investigation revealed the buyer had a history of fraud involving school districts nationwide. A criminal false pretense investigation was initiated, and after contact was reestablished, a payment plan was arranged. Approximately $50,000 has since been paid, with the final payment expected.\nDrug enforcement remained a priority throughout the year. Officers spent extensive time investigating illegal drug possession and distribution, resulting in felony arrests involving methamphetamine, heroin, fentanyl, Xanax, and cocaine. Those investigations are ongoing, and additional charges are expected.\nFunding from the opioid settlement was used to purchase investigative equipment and support controlled buys. Sgt. Myers and Patrolman Ross also completed specialized drug interdiction training hosted by the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office.\nAccording to records from the Roane County 911 Center, the department responded to 933 emergency and non-emergency calls in 2025, excluding calls made directly to the department. Officers also filed 47 crash reports and continued to provide vehicle lockout services as demand increased.\nOperational improvements were made during the year with support from the mayor. Outdated Tasers were replaced with Taser 10 devices, scheduled for deployment in January 2026, and new body-worn cameras were purchased. The department also moved its offices to 102 Court St., providing expanded space for evidence storage, training, interviews, and administrative functions.\nLooking ahead to 2026, Williams said the departments goal will be to continue its efforts to improve safety and quality of life.\n“We are going to continue to clean up the community and the county,” Williams said.",
