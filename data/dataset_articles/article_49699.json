  "text": "[Politics](https://www.ripplesnigeria.com/politics/) JUST IN: New minimum wage coming in 2024 —Tinubu President Bola Tinubu on Monday assured workers that a new minimum wage will be implemented in the new year 2024. The president stated this during a nation-wide broadcast to mark the new year 2024. Tinubu said, “We will work diligently to make sure every Nigerian feels the impact of their government. The economic aspirations and the material well-being of the poor, the most vulnerable and the working people shall not be neglected. “It is in this spirit that we are going to implement a new national living wage for our industrious workers this new year. It is not only good economics to do this, it is also a morally and politically correct thing to do.
