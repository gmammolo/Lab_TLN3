  "text": "Wrexham striker Paul Mullin and midfielder Elliot Lee have signed contract extensions with the club until 2027.\nThe League Two side announced the news on New Year’s Day, with a midnight announcement shared by owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.\nMullin has scored 89 goals in 116 appearances since joining Wrexham in 2021, while Lee is the club’s top scorer this season with 13 goals in 29 games in all competitions.\nHappy New Year,\n[@Wrexham_AFC]🏴🏴\n— Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds)\n[January 1, 2024]\n“We’re delighted we’ve agreed deals with Paul and Elliot. They are two really key players for the club moving forward,” manager Phil Parkinson told the club website.\nAdvertisement\n“There’s always a lot of talk going into a transfer window, but the most important thing is to keep hold of your best players — they are two very important signings for us.”\nMullin said: “I’m unbelievably happy and grateful to extend my stay at Wrexham. Since signing for the club, I’ve loved every single second. It’s not just become my club, but my whole family also.”\nLee said: “It means a lot. When I signed 18 months ago, there were high expectations but not I even saw just how well it was going to go. I’m delighted to be extending my stay with Wrexham.”\nWrexham are third in the fourth tier following Friday’s 3-1 loss at Walsall as they attempt to secure back-to-back promotions after winning the National League. They return to action at home to Barrow on January 1.\nGO DEEPER\nWhat to expect from Wrexham in the January transfer window\n(Photo: Getty Images)",
