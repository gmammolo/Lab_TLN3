  "text": "A 7-year-old girl abducted by a stranger in Sherburne County was safely recovered early Thursday after law enforcement tracked down a suspect and launched an overnight search involving more than 200 officers and hundreds of community volunteers.\nAuthorities identified the suspect as 28-year-old Joseph Bragg of Maple Grove. The child, Brynlee Nelson, was found unharmed after being taken from Zimmerman and later located in Albert Lea.\nSherburne County officials said Brynlee was last seen around 4 p.m. Wednesday after getting off her school bus. Deputies received the initial call at 6:31 p.m.\n“At 6:31 p.m. our office received a call of the missing 7-year-old named Brynlee in the city of Zimmerman,” Commander Ben Zawacki said during a Thursday morning press conference. “Deputies were advised that Brynlee usually got off the bus around 4 p.m. There was a miscommunication amongst family about where she could have been dropped off after the bus stop.”\nAuthorities said the initial response was chaotic as tips poured in and first responders searched the area.\n“The scene was chaotic. There were numerous tips and speculation being called into law enforcement,” Zawacki said.\nEarly reports included information about a black vehicle seen near the school bus. Investigators later clarified that while a black vehicle appeared in video footage, there was no evidence it was involved.\n“Investigators were able to determine that no one actually saw Brynlee enter the black car,” Zawacki said.\nAuthorities released a surveillance image showing Brynlee walking in a snow suit after getting off the school bus as the search intensified.\nAs the investigation progressed, authorities said they developed a suspect and determined the case involved a stranger abduction. Officials confirmed the investigation also included a social media component.\n“The only thing that I can tell you is that there was a social media tie, and that’s still kind of an active part of the investigation, so we don’t really want to go into further detail on that,” Zawacki said.\nReports have circulated online that the suspect may have contacted other parents through Facebook groups advertising nanny or childcare services. When asked about those claims, Zawacki declined to elaborate.\n“That’s a piece of it that I don’t think we can talk about at this point right now,” he said.\nZawacki said they were able to narrow in on a suspect and potential vehicle through investigative work.\n“Through investigative techniques we developed a general location of the suspect and potential vehicles involved,” he said.\nAuthorities identified a white Dodge Ram pickup as a vehicle of interest and coordinated with law enforcement in Albert Lea. Officials said they delayed issuing an AMBER Alert out of concern that doing so could alert the suspect.\n“The decision at that time was to not send the AMBER Alert out in fear that the suspect would be notified,” Zawacki said.\nOnce law enforcement was positioned to make an arrest, the AMBER Alert was issued. Shortly before 1 a.m., officers located the vehicle in Albert Lea.\n“We were notified that the white Dodge pickup was located and that the suspect was taken into custody without incident and Brynlee was located safe,” Zawacki said.\nBrynlee was transported to a hospital for evaluation and later reunited with her family.\nAuthorities credited the outcome to a massive coordinated response.\n“We estimate around 200 law enforcement officers and fire personnel assisted in some way last night,” Zawacki said. “I also want to thank the community. Estimated 700 volunteers came out in the sub-zero temperatures to assist in trying to locate Brynlee.”\nMinnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans praised the response and emphasized the seriousness of the case.\n“This is every family’s worst nightmare,” Evans said. “To lose your child — whether they wander off in terribly cold temperatures or, in a case like this, that they were taken by somebody — and to have everybody come together to find that child.”\nEvans said the suspect does not appear to have a significant criminal history.\n“There’s no significant criminal history with this individual other than maybe some minor court actions,” he said.\nOfficials also used the briefing to remind parents to monitor their children’s online activity.\n“What I can tell you is obviously we tell parents to monitor the social media use by their children, especially young children,” one official said. “There’s just way too much access by people that would want to do harm.”\nSherburne County Attorney Dawn Nyhus said charges are under review.\n“Our office will be reviewing the information as it comes in,” Nyhus said. “Any criminal complaint that will be issued will be publicly available.”\nAuthorities said the investigation remains active and that additional details will be released as appropriate.\nState lawmaker praises response\nState Rep. Paul Novotny, chair of the House Public Safety Committee, also issued a statement Thursday praising first responders, law enforcement and community members for their role in the girl’s safe recovery.\n“In a time that has been difficult for so many Minnesotans, yesterday our community showed the very best of who we are—neighbors helping neighbors, and courage in the face of uncertainty,” Novotny said.\n“I want to thank the Sherburne County Sheriff’s Office, local and neighboring law enforcement agencies, fire departments, emergency responders, and every volunteer who stepped forward to help bring this child home,” he added.",
