  "text": "Nagpur: A 23-year-old construction worker, who suffered a major accident at workplace on December 26, was saved thanks to the quick action by his co-workers and skilled medical intervention by doctors.Sumit Kumar not only survived the accident, but is now capable of walking again after full recovery.106363785 A metal rod had pierced Sumit Kumar’s leg during the fall, leaving him unconscious and bleeding profusely. “Time was our biggest enemy,” recalls Dr Pinak Dande, director of Dande Hospital, where Sumit was rushed after the accident. “X-ray showed shattered bones, severed arteries, and a leg turning blue from compromised blood flow,” he said.Dr Dande and a team of specialists got into the action mode. Orthopedic surgeon Dr Siddharth Jagtap meticulously removed the rod, while plastic surgeon Dr Parikshit Janai worked to salvage muscle and skin. Anesthetist Dr Girish Thakre kept Sumit under watch and critical care intensivist Dr Sushant Mule prepared for potential complications. Radiologist Amol Gawale’s expertise proved invaluable in navigating through the delicate surgery.“The rod had damaged vital structures, and the leg was on the verge of necrosis. Thankfully, our coordinated effort paid off,” said Dr Dande. Sumit underwent a successful surgery, and while the road to recovery is long, his leg has been saved.This incident, Dr Dande points out, highlights the crucial role of timely first aid. Praising Sumit’s co-workers, Dr Dande said, “The co-workers were unable to remove the rod but made sure they prevented further injury. They brought an electric cutter and separated him from the injury spot. Sumit was stabilized and then brought to the hospital. All these steps were very crucial,” Dr Dande said.Besides, collaboration between doctors from different specialties ensured every aspect of Sumit’s condition was addressed. “Access to modern equipment and resources played a vital role in the complex surgery. Workplace accidents, unfortunately, are not uncommon. So, everyone should learn basic first aid,” Dr Dande said.We also published the following articles recentlySumit Antil, Sheetal Devi win best male and female athlete at 1st Differently Abled Sports AwardsSumit Antil and Sheetal Devi won Best Male and Best Female athlete titles at the inaugural Differently Abled Sports Awards.
