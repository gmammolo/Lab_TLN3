  "text": "Convenience store chain\nKwik Trip will invest more than $151 million to expand its operations at multiple locations throughout Wisconsin, creating more than 500 jobs by 2027, according to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC).\n“Kwik Trip is one of Wisconsin’s most instantly recognizable success stories,” said Missy Hughes, secretary and CEO of WEDC. “While most of us are familiar with Kwik Trip for its retail operations, the company continues to grow its manufacturing and supply chain base in our state, which is creating hundreds of jobs and new investments even faster than anyone could have anticipated.”\nThe newly proposed capital investment would encompass further expansion of its dairy, commissary, and bakery facilities in La Crosse, Wis., the purchase and renovation of a commercial office building in Onalaska, and the construction of a new satellite distribution center.\nAs a result of the growth at its La Crosse support center and the construction and acquisition of 168 new retail locations, Kwik Trip’s total eligible Wisconsin employee count has increased from 4,342 in 2017 to 12,442 in 2023, a total increase of 8,100 workers.\n\"Growth is good, not only for Kwik Trip, but most importantly for our coworkers and the communities we serve. As a Top Workplace, we are able to provide strong, vibrant jobs throughout Wisconsin. We appreciate the support from the WEDC to make this happen,\" said Scott Zietlow, the CEO and President of Kwik Trip.\nPhoto courtesy of Kwik Trip.",
