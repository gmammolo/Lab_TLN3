  "text": "MANILA, Philippines — The operator of the local bourse is keeping its fingers crossed that better economic conditions would entice investors to return to the stock market this year.\n\"The expected improvement in macroeconomic indicators are poised to drive market conditions in 2024,\" said Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) president and CEO Ramon Monzon.\nFor the most part, the local bourse was sluggish in 2023, closing the year down by 1.8 percent and wearing red on the last trading session with most gauges down.\nMonzon, however, said there are reasons to be optimistic this year with the Philippines projected to lead the ASEAN region with the highest GDP growth in 2024 at 6.2 percent.\nThis compares to Vietnam's six percent, Indonesia's five percent, Malaysia' 4.6 percent, Thailand's 3.3 percent and Singapore's 2.5 percent based on ADB’s Asian Development Outlook.\nAside from economic growth, inflation is projected to slow this year to close to four percent from an average of 6.9 percent as of end-November 2023.\n\"The US Fed and BSP are expected to cut rates in 2024, which are currently at 5.25 percent to 5.50 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively.\nFor 2024, analysts project the PSE index (PSEi) at a range of 6,800 to 8,300 points.\n\"The expected rate cuts by the US Fed and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas as well as the Philippine government's aggressive spending on infrastructure projects, and continued increase in foreign investment pledges are expected to stimulate consumption, generate job opportunities, and encourage additional investment,\" Monzon said.\nOn the other hand, there are risks to the positive outlook including the potential impact of higher transport charges, electricity rates, and international oil prices.\nFor capital raising activities, the PSE expects six companies to go public with the full year capital raising forecast at P175 billion, around P40 billion of which will come from IPOs.\n\"We are expecting six initial public offerings (IPO) for the year, starting with the listing of Citicore Renewable Energy Corp.. Since no new REITs were added in 2023, we hope to see REIT IPOs make a comeback this year,\" Monzon said.\nOne awaited REIT or real estate investment trust listing is that of SM Prime Holdings, which could be the biggest REIT listing at a possible offering of $1 billion.",
