  "text": "New York’s minimum-wage workers have more than just the new year to celebrate\nJanuary 1, 2024, 12:12 AM ET\n• 2 min read\nALBANY, N.Y. —\nNew York’s minimum-wage workers had more than just the new year to celebrate Monday, with a pay bump kicking in as the clock ticked over to 2024.\nIn the first of a series of annual increases slated for the Empire State, the minimum wage increased to $16 in\nNew York City and some of its suburbs, up from $15. In the rest of the state, the new minimum wage is $15, up from $14.20.\nThe state’s minimum wage is expected to increase every year until it reaches $17 in\nNew York City and its suburbs, and $16 in the rest of the state by 2026. Future hikes will be tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, a measurement of inflation. New York is one of 22 states getting minimum wage rises in the new year, according to a recent report by the Economic Policy Institute.\nIn California, the minimum wage increased to $16, up from $15.50, while in Connecticut it increased to $15.69 from the previous rate of $15.\nThis most recent pay bump in\nNew York is part of an agreement made last year between Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state Legislature. The deal came over the objections of some employers, as well as some liberal Democrats who said it didn’t go high enough.\nThe federal minimum wage in the\nUnited States has stayed at $7.25 per hour since 2009, but states and some localities are free to set higher amounts. Thirty states, including New Mexico and Washington, have done so.
