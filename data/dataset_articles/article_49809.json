He highlighted the government's efforts to curb inflation and reduce interest rates, foreseeing a stable economic recovery for the country, its businesses and individuals in 2024.\nFocusing on employment, the prime minister announced plans to convert part-time jobs into full-time roles and create more jobs, especially for the young. Emphasizing the value of young workers in an aging population, he said it is important to treat them well.\nStore also addressed the younger generation's concerns regarding climate change, biodiversity loss, oceanic plastic pollution and urban air quality. He committed to more significant actions in these areas, emphasizing that climate action must now surpass the pace of climate change.\nHe highlighted some ongoing green initiatives, including the replacement of old ferries and buses with electric ones, as well as the energy-saving measures adopted by Norwegian households.
