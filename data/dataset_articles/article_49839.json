  "text": "Former apprentice becomes production manager at the company where he started at 16 A loyal employee has been promoted to production manager at Stairways Midlands, almost three decades on from starting out there as a teenager. [John Corser](/news/authors/john-corser/) Andy Clarke, 44, joined Stairways Midlands, one of the UK’s largest manufacturers of volume staircases and door solutions, as a carpentry and joinery apprentice at just 16. He worked his way up over the past 28 years and has now been made Production Manager at the Walsall factory, where he has spent the majority of his career, after Stairways acquired the factory 20 years ago. The story of his steady climb with one company is, as Andy describes, “something you don’t think happens anymore”, but he counts himself fortunate to have remained loyal to one company throughout his career. Andy said: “I’ve worked all my life to get into this role. I started from the bottom and progressed through, staying loyal to the same company my whole career – something you think of only happening for people years ago. “It’s a great company to work for, and it has been very good to me. All those years of hard work and loyalty were recognised - it has all paid off.",
