Samsung Heavy Industries cautioned that the deal is a conditional contract subject to the final investment decision of the client.\nSamsung Heavy Industries formed a consortium with the US engineering company Black & Veatch and signed an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract for the design, procurement, and construction of the FLNG.\nAs part of the agreement, the company will be responsible for the hull and topside plant processes of the FLNG.\nWith this contract, Samsung Heavy Industries has increased its FLNG order backlog to two units. The company explained that this contract, signed on Dec. 29 last year, is included in the order performance for the same year.\nConsequently, its cumulative order intake for last year amounted to $8.3 billion, achieving 87% of its annual order target of $9.5 billion.\nWrite to Jae-Fu Kim at\nMore to Read\n-\nShipping & ShipbuildingSamsung Heavy wins $240 mn order for two VLACs\nDec 26,\nShipping & ShipbuildingSamsung Heavy develops container loss prevention device\nOct 17,\nShipping & ShipbuildingSamsung Heavy develops laser high-speed welding robot for LNG vessels\nSep 21,\nShipping & ShipbuildingSamsung Heavy, Pan Ocean to co-develop digital solutions\nSep 19,\nShipping & ShipbuildingSamsung Heavy in $3.1 bn methanol-powered ship deal with Evergreen\nJul 17, 2023 (Gmt+09:00)3 Min read\nComment 0",
