  "text": "Audio By Carbonatix\nThe Minister for Gender, Children and Social Protection, Dr Agnes Naa Momo Lartey, has paid a visit to the family of eight-year-old Jalila Abdul Jalil following reports of alleged abuse involving the child.\nThe visit comes after a report aired by Channel One TV on the alleged abuse of Jalila, a Class Two pupil of St Olives Grammar Boarding School in Dodowa.\nThe Minister said the visit was to convey the government’s sympathy to the family and to assure them of the State’s commitment to the child’s safety, recovery, and long-term well-being.\nAddressing the family, Dr Lartey described the incident as unfortunate and reaffirmed her determination to ensure that Jalila receives comprehensive medical, psychosocial and welfare support.\nShe also assured the family that the Ministry would closely follow the case until its conclusion.\nEmphasising the government’s stance on child protection, the Minister said, “Anybody who harms a child harms the nation,” adding that the law would be allowed to take its full course, regardless of the persons involved.\nAs part of the visit, Dr Lartey made donations to support the family, including a cash amount of GH¢5,000, as well as food items and other household supplies.\nThe family expressed appreciation to the Minister for the visit and the support extended but appealed for swift justice in the matter.\nDr Lartey also commended Channel One TV and other media organisations for bringing the case, and similar incidents, to public attention, noting that responsible journalism plays a critical role in protecting vulnerable children and ensuring accountability.\nShe was accompanied by the Member of Parliament for the area, Theresa Lardi Awuni, the Head of the Domestic Violence Secretariat, Madam Malonin Asibi, and other officials.",
