  "text": "UK’s new visa rule will now permit people on tourist visa to work in the country\n106475772As per the latest development, starting from January 31, the United Kingdom is all set to implement substantial changes to its visa regulations. These changes will open up new avenues for business endeavours for individuals holding visitor visas.\nAs per the latest updates, tourist visa holders will now be granted permission to engage in work-related activities with clients and undertake remote work while visiting the UK. It’s expected that this move will provide a considerable boost to both business and tourism within the country.\nIf reports are to go by, the UK Government has also released an update to its immigration rules, allowing expanded activities on Visitor Visas, with the changes slated to come into effect from January 31, 2024.\n106381514So, here are some of the key points of the revised rules:\nEmployees of companies with branches in both the UK and internationally can engage in client work abroad, provided it constitutes a small portion of their overseas responsibilities, which is crucial for a project or service by their UK branch, and is not directly delivered to a UK client by the overseas employer. While visitors can work remotely from the UK, the primary purpose of their stay should not be remote work. Scientists, researchers, and academics are permitted to conduct research in the UK, with certain exceptions for academics applying for a 12-month visit visa or seeking permission extensions within the country. Lawyers will be allowed to engage in additional activities, such as providing advice, acting as an expert witness, participating in legal proceedings, and teaching. The Permitted Paid Engagement (PPE) Visitor route will be integrated into the Standard Visitor route, eliminating the need for a separate visa for those involved in paid engagements, though they must still plan the activity within 30 days of arrival. 106475786Last month, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt pledged that the UK Government would expand business visitor rules to enable business people to take part in a broader range of permitted activities and paid engagements, effective from January 2024.\nThese changes, particularly the allowance for remote work, are expected to have a positive impact on both business and tourism in the United Kingdom. Additional changes to the regulations for business visitors are expected in 2024.",
