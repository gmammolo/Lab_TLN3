  "text": "Man celebrates last day of work after 48 years at supermarket chain WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (KCCI) - For an Iowa man, the start of 2024 will bring a lot of change to his normal routine as he retires from supermarket chain Hy-Vee after almost five decades. It’s not every day Steve Mick gets chauffeured around, but after 48 years at Hy-Vee, Sunday was his last day and his boss insisted on the special ride to work. Outside the West Des Moines supermarket was a display celebrating Mick’s years of service. “That’s amazing,” Mick said. “Wow. It’s about all I can say.” Inside the store, countless hugs and congratulations from family, friends and former colleagues showed the impact Mick had on the community. He started at Hy-Vee behind the meat counter in 1975 when he was just 16. “He’s the same person today: extremely nice, extremely thoughtful, willing to help the customers,” longtime colleague Marilyn Cook said. “He’s been such a hard worker all his life, and today is kind of a bittersweet day for all of us,” said Mick’s daughter, Kerri Driscoll. Mick worked at different Hy-Vee locations throughout his career, his last being the store in West Des Moines on Jordan Creek Parkway. “It was just a place that fit for me,” Mick said. “Been a long haul, and it’s been well worth it.” As the chapter at Hy-Vee comes to an end, the cake at Mick’s party is a hint as to what part of retirement looks like: camping and time in nature with family. “I’m going to let life happen to me, enjoy every minute of it,” Mick said. Mick’s co-workers say he will be missed after bringing smiles to people during his nearly five decades on the job. Copyright 2024 KCCI via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.",
