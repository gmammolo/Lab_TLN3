  "text": "Over $5 million collected by U.S. Attorney’s Office in 2025\nOXFORD, Miss. – The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Mississippi collected more than $5.2 million in civil and criminal actions during fiscal year 2025, U.S. Attorney Scott F. Leary announced Thursday.\nOf the $5,293,082.96 total, officials reported that $3,100,899.34 stemmed from criminal actions, while $2,192,183.62 was recovered through civil litigation.\nThe district further collaborated with federal agencies to seize $1,172,013 in asset forfeiture actions. These funds are deposited into the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund, which supports law enforcement initiatives and provides restitution to crime victims.\n“Two important components of justice concern punishing the offender and making the victim whole,” Leary said. “I want to thank our law enforcement partners who make our restitution program a success.”\nThe office also assisted other Department of Justice components in recovering an additional $1,135.59 in joint criminal actions. The collections reflect a continued federal commitment to financial accountability and victim recovery within the district.",
