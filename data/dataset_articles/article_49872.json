  "text": "Rate cut hopes boost labor funds' year-to-date gains\n Expectations of interest rate cuts and moderating inflation stabilized global financial markets and boosted the value of funds managed by the government's Bureau of Labor Funds to more than NT$606 billion (US$19.68 billion) in the first 11 months of 2023, the bureau said Tuesday.\nData released by the bureau showed the accumulated gains, the increase in the value of assets in the funds' portfolios and income on investments, totaled NT$606.67 billion in the first 11 months of last year, up about NT$182.79 billion from the amount accumulated in the first 10 months of the year.\nThe November gains reversed the NT$153.48 billion fall recorded in October, according to the data.\nThe bureau said with inflation showing signs of slowing, hopes that major central banks would ease their monetary policy following aggressive rate hikes sent share and bond prices higher worldwide in November.\nIn the first 11 months of last year, the Taiex, the weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, soared 23.31 percent, while the MSCI World Index also surged 16.60 percent. In addition, the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index rose 1.50 percent in the same period.\nThe combined value of the funds managed by the bureau, including the Labor Pension Fund, the Labor Retirement Fund, the Labor Insurance Fund, the Employment Insurance Fund, and the Arrears Wage Payment Fund, totaled about NT$6.03 trillion in the first 11 months of 2023.\nBased on that value, the gains represented a rate of return of 10.82 percent, according to the bureau.\nThe value of assets in the new Labor Pension Fund, launched in 2015, totaled NT$3.96 trillion at the end of November, the highest of any fund, and its rate of return during the first 11 months of 2023 was 10.58 percent, the bureau said.\nThe Labor Retirement Fund has been in place since 1984, and had about NT$994.0 billion in assets as of the end of November, with a rate of return of 12.66 percent, the bureau said.\nIn the latest policy-making meeting held on Dec. 12-13, the U.S. Federal Reserve left its key interest rates unchanged for the third consecutive meeting, raising hopes that its rate hike cycle had finished.\nIn addition, in the \"dot plot,\" the Fed's closely watched grid of individual members' expectations, the Fed implied after the December policy-making meeting that it would cut interest rates at least three times next year by 75 basis points.\nDespite the rate cut hopes, the bureau said there are worries that recent aggressive rate hikes by major central banks would continue to negatively impact the global economy, while geopolitical tensions are also expected to affect recovery.\nThe bureau said it will keep a close eye on any economic and political developments worldwide and adjust its investment strategy to push up the long-term returns of the labor funds it manages.\n ",
