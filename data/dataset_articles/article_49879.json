  "text": "(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves) Wagon founders Robert Rajfar and Tyler Sala set out to build a 3PL characterized by integrity and a genuine dedication to best-in-class customer service. Following a successful fourth quarter, the company is looking toward its 2024 goals – from enhancing its instantiation capabilities to establishing itself as a partner in food and beverage, HAZMAT and other high-value spaces. To accomplish these goals, Rajfar and Sala are looking to add several like-minded logistics professionals to their sales and customer success teams. Overall, the company plans to add 20 jobs in the coming year. For those interested in positions at Wagon, it's important to understand what the company means by “best-in-class customer service.” “Everyone says they're customer-centric, but no one talks about what that actually means,” said Pat Stradinger, vice president of customer success at Waggon. Rajfer's definition of “best-in-class customer experience” means being readily available, offering fair but competitive prices, and having an owner's mentality. He said it is important for the entire organization, not just the leadership team, to stick with the same set of customer-first values. Most of all, it's important for new Wagan employees to be curious and excited to learn. “I had a lot of success early in my career when I became more curious,” Salas said. Curious people have a natural desire to look deeper, making them more inclined to gain knowledge about how supply chains work on a global scale. This change in perspective is called moving from A to B thinking to A to Z thinking. Wagon wants to hire A to Z thinkers. In addition to being curious and dedicated to customer service, all Wagon Teammates must be excited to help build a company from the ground up. This work requires a far higher level of patience than more corporate positions – and a far more developed ability to wear multiple hats within the organization. “We're looking for serious individuals, people who have been in the trenches,” Stradinger said. “We want to know that our customers are interacting with experts.” Wagon wants to hear from people who agree with this description – especially curious, serious logistics professionals who have a solid base of industry knowledge and a desire to create something new.
