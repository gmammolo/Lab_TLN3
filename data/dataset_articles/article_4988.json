  "text": "Lagos police declare Grange, Avi-Cenna schools safe after explosion threat\nLagos State Commissioner of Police, Olohundare Jimoh, has declared Grange School and Avi-Cenna School in Ikeja safe for continued academic and administrative activities, after both private educational facilities shut down operations due to threats of explosions.\nThe state police spokesperson, Abimbola Adebisi, in a statement on Thursday, said the development followed Mr Olohundare’s visit to the schools, alongside bomb experts and other tactical teams, for on-the-spot assessment and security reinforcement.\nShe said the team had found no explosive or hazardous device.\nMs Adebisi said the human resources managers and chief security officers of both schools had, on Wednesday, informed the police headquarters of the threats received via WhatsApp with the same numbers.\n“Upon receipt of the reports, the Commissioner of Police, CP Olohundare Jimoh, immediately mobilised and personally led a team of police operatives, including a team of experts from the Command’s Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (EOD-CBRN), the Rapid Response Squad (RRS), and other tactical teams, to the school premises for on-the-spot assessment and security reinforcement.\n“A painstaking and comprehensive sweep of the entire school environment, including classrooms, administrative offices, halls, playgrounds, and surrounding premises, was conducted by the EOD-CBRN experts to rule out the presence of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) or any other dangerous or suspicious materials.\n“The operation yielded no explosive or hazardous device, and the schools were consequently declared safe for continued academic and administrative activities,” Ms Adebisi said.\nShe disclosed that Mr Olohundare has, however, ordered that the investigation be intensified to identify and apprehend the senders of the messages.\nThe police spokesperson also stated that a combined team of personnel has already been strategically deployed on a permanent basis to the affected schools to ensure round-the-clock safety of students, staff, and school facilities.\nShe assured parents, guardians, school authorities, and the public that the police remain proactive, responsive, and committed to maintaining peace and the safety of residents.\nMrs Adebisi urged members of the public to remain calm and vigilant, continue with their lawful activities, and report any suspicious activity or security concerns to the nearest police station.\nThe schools had communicated their immediate shutdown of academic activities due to threats of an explosion in separate letters addressed to parents and guardians, seen by Peoples Gazette on Thursday.\nWe have recently deactivated our website's comment provider in favour of other channels of distribution and commentary.
