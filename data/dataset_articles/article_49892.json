  "text": "SINGAPORE (ICIS)–Singapore’s economy expanded by 2.8% year on year in the fourth quarter, supported by robust expansions in the manufacturing and construction sectors, preliminary official data showed on Tuesday.\nFor 2023, the country’s GDP grew by 1.2% year on year, slowing from the 3.6% expansion in 2022, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said in a statement.\nOn a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, Singapore’s economy expanded by 1.7%, extending the 1.3% expansion in the third quarter of 2023.\nThe manufacturing sector expanded by 3.2% year on year in the fourth quarter, a turnaround from the 4.7% contraction in the previous quarter.\nLatest manufacturing data for November showed that Singapore’s overall chemicals cluster output rose by 2.7% year on year in November, reversing the 0.8% decline in the previous month and the 12.9% drop in September.\nWithin the chemicals cluster, petrochemicals output fell by 10.5% year on year in the fourth quarter, while output from the petroleum and specialties segments were up by 2.4% and 14.1%, respectively.\nThe construction sector expanded by 9.1% year on year in the fourth quarter, faster than the 6.2% growth in the previous quarter.\nThe advance GDP estimates for the fourth quarter of 2023 are computed largely from data from October and November.\nSingapore is a major petrochemical hub in southeast Asia, housing integrated petrochemical complexes of energy giants ExxonMobil and Shell.\nSingapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 31 December noted that the government’s growth projection for 2024 is expected to be in the 1% to 3% range.\nHowever, he added that “much will depend on the external environment”.\n“For some years to come, we must expect the external environment to be less favourable to our security and prosperity,” Lee added.\nFocus article by Nurluqman Suratman",
