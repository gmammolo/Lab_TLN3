  "text": "Baltimore police officers responded to a house fire on Jan. 7. Without hesitation, they ran toward danger to rescue people from the flames.\nThe intense imagery was captured on police body-worn cameras.\nWith little time to spare, police responded to the emergency at Wilkens Avenue and South Smallwood Street. Their body-worn cameras captured the chaos and rescues.\nOne officer said he heard a couple of booms, called in the fire and then ran two blocks toward the home.\n“I see multiple people looking for help,” said Officer Benjamin Brown. “They are looking for help, so I yelled, ‘Go to the back.’ When I meet them at the back, I happened to grab a kid.”\nAround six officers helped rescue five people and two pets from the home.",
