  "text": "President Dr. Arif Alvi has emphasized the need to provide employment opportunities to women and enabling working-environment to increase their economic participation. He was speaking at a meeting chaired by him during his visit to the Federal Ombudsman Secretariat for Protection Against Harassment at Workplace (FOSPAH) in Islamabad today. The President called for taking appropriate legislative measures at the federal and provincial levels to ensure the protection of women’s property rights. He said transfer of property by women to their family members due to pressures should be discouraged. Dr Arif Alvi urged FOSPAH to further increase its outreach and efficiency to provide speedy justice to women in harassment and property cases at their doorsteps. He also advised FOSPAH to enhance its linkages with NGOs and women’s rights organizations in Pakistan to seek suggestions for improving women’s status. On the occasion, Federal Ombudsperson for Protection Against Harassment at Workplace Fauzia Viqar informed that 725 harassment cases were registered with FOSPAH, during 2023, out of which 517 cases have been decided. She said an upsurge has been witnessed in the registration of harassment and women’s property cases with FOSPAH due to the awareness campaign about its role and functions.",
