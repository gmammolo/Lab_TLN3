  "text": "Airtel Africa announced CEO Olusegun Ogunsanya is to retire after more than 12 years at the operator group, with its director of transformation Sunil Taldar set to take over the top job at the start of July.\nThe outgoing chief has\nbeen at the helm since 2021, having previously led its unit in Nigeria for almost a decade.\nAfter handing over the reins Ogunsanya will act as an advisor for the company’s new leadership and will become chair of its charitable foundation.\nNew boss Taldar joined Airtel Africa last year having previously held various roles at affiliate Bharti Airtel. In his current role the executive is responsible for overseeing strategic initiatives focused on transforming its business and operations.\nIn a statement Airtel Africa chair Sunil Bharti Mittal praised the outgoing chief, adding Taldar’s “industry experience, strategic vision, constant customer focus and proven record of delivery will enable him to deliver our strategic objectives and to lead the group in the next stages of its development.”",
