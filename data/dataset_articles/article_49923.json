  "text": "Evelyn Partners has bolstered its investment management team in its Leeds office by appointing Lauren Glaister as a partner.\nShe joins from LGT Wealth Management’s discretionary fund management business (previously part of Abrdn), where she was a senior investment manager.\nPrior to LGT and Abrdn, she worked for\nTilney Investment Management (now Evelyn Partners) and Redmayne-Bentley.\nShe specialises in managing investments for private clients and is a chartered fellow of the Chartered Institute for Securities & Investment.\nGlaister is also a trustee of Leeds Hospitals Charity and sits on its finance and performance and audit and risk committees.\nEvelyn Partners’ Leeds office provides a range of services, including financial planning, investment management and tax advice.\nIan Gibson, managing partner in Evelyn Partners’ Leeds office, said: “I’m delighted to welcome Lauren to our Leeds investment management team.\n“Lauren is a former colleague, and I am looking forward to working with her again as we continue with our growth plans in the region over the course of 2024.\n“I know that Lauren’s extensive, senior investment management will be a great asset for our business and clients.”\nGlaister added: “I am thrilled to be joining the Evelyn Partners team in Leeds, I know many of them well and feel it will be an excellent and important move in my career.\n“The investment proposition offered is second to none and along with my new colleagues I believe we have a real opportunity to further the superior growth already achieved.”\nEvelyn Partners is an integrated wealth management and professional services group, created following the merger of Tilney and Smith & Williamson in 2020.\nWith £55.6bn of assets under management (as at 30 September 2023), it is one the largest UK wealth managers.\nThe business has a network of offices across 30 towns and cities in the UK, as well as the Republic of Ireland and the Channel Islands.\nIn July 2023 Paul\nGeddes became Evelyn Partners new group’s chief executive officer.\nHe succeed Chris Woodhouse, who retired from full-time executive management after five and half years in the role.",
