  "text": "A late-night FaceTime call to Barron Trump, son of President Donald Trump, may have saved a woman's life during an alleged violent assault in London, according to testimony in an ongoing rape trial.\nMatvei Rumiantsev, 22, admitted answering the call from the president's son during what prosecutors describe as a brutal attack on a woman he knew, according to testimony Thursday at Snaresbrook Crown Court. The defendant told jurors he answered the incoming video call and immediately pointed the camera at the alleged victim, though he struggled to explain why.\n\"I don't know what went through my head but I answered yes,\" Rumiantsev said from the witness stand. He claimed he hoped the woman would realize \"her behaviour was unreasonable\" when confronted with someone watching.\nThe Russian national faces multiple serious charges, including two counts of rape, assault causing actual bodily harm, intentional strangulation, and perverting the course of justice. The charges stem from incidents allegedly occurring between November 2024 and January 2025.\nDuring the early morning hours of Jan. 18, 2025, when Barron Trump called the woman—a friend he had met prior to the incidents, rather than the woman answering, a shirtless man picked up the phone, the younger Trump told British authorities.\n\"The individual who picked up the phone was a shirtless man with darkish hair, although I didn't get a good look, this view lasted maybe one second and I was racing with adrenaline,\" Barron Trump wrote in a May email to investigating officers. \"The camera was then flipped to the victim getting hit while crying, stating something in Russian.\"\nThe entire interaction lasted between five and seven seconds before the call was disconnected, according to the email read in court.\nBarron Trump, now 19 and a freshman at New York University's prestigious Stern School of Business, immediately contacted British emergency services despite the time zone difference. In a transcript of that call, he told the dispatcher: \"Oh I'm calling from the US, uh, I just got a call from a girl, you know, she's getting beat up.\"\nenrolledat NYU's Stern School of Business in September 2024 after graduating from Oxbridge Academy in West Palm Beach, Florida. The business school has an acceptance rate of around 3 percent and ranks among the nation's top undergraduate business programs.\nThe defendant testified Thursday that he and the alleged victim had been drinking together on the evening of Jan. 17, 2025, and claimed they engaged in consensual sex twice. He described the woman as being \"in a stage of complete breakdown\" before he answered the FaceTime call.\n\"She was just completely hysterical crying, screaming, shouting at me,\" Rumiantsev told the jury while wearing a blue suit and white shirt.\nRumiantsev, who worked as a receptionist at the time of his arrest, has experience in freestyle wrestling and acknowledged the alleged victim is significantly smaller than him. However, he denied ever strangling, hitting, or kicking her, claiming he only grabbed her arms on Jan. 18 to prevent her from striking him.\nRumiantsev was arrested on the morning of Jan. 18, 2025, after the woman contacted police. Investigators later reached out to Barron Trump in April 2025 after learning he had contacted British authorities shortly after witnessing the alleged assault on FaceTime.\nCourt testimony revealed Rumiantsev became aware of the alleged victim's friendship with the president's son in October 2024. On Nov. 3, 2024, the defendant told jurors he had told the woman he was uncomfortable with the friendship during an argument with her.\n\"I was in no way controlling but I was trying to make her know that if she feels unwell seeing messages I had with girls 10 years ago, she could maybe understand how I felt when she was [sitting] there this moment texting someone else,\" Rumiantsev testified.\nThe trial continues at Snaresbrook Crown Court.\nA spokesperson for the White House did not return a request for comment from NTD News prior to publication.",
