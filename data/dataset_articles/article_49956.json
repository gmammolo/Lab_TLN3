  "text": "Newcastle engineering firm creates jobs to bolster growth plans throughout 2024 Business performance in the civil and structural engineering sector will remain resilient with green shoots starting to show in the residential market, said Ross Oakley, managing director of Newcastle engineers RWO. This will drive additional growth and expansion over the next 12 months for North East engineers such as RWO, with a steady stream of work coming up in the year ahead as previously delayed projects get the green light. Ross Oakley also expects to see increasing volumes of work for geo-environmental engineering services as activity remains ‘extremely’ busy in the sector with a plethora of new projects coming forward in the new year. Civil engineering work could see an industry predicted 17 per cent rise in starts in the next 12 months, an achievable figure, Ross Oakley believes, whose firm will see increased levels of work for social housing providers, and a growing footprint in burgeoning data centre design and build. Ross commented: “We are looking forward to cautious growth in 2024, driven by a strengthening in work across almost all sectors and rescheduled projects getting underway. New investment in utilities, energy and telecoms infrastructure will be to fore in the coming months, powering growth in demand for services like ours.” RWO is targeting revenues in excess of £3m in the next 12 months as it looks towards another strong performance in 2025 with plans for further investment in its workforce helping to drive growth, said managing director Ross Oakley. He added: “We are recruiting to fuel planned growth in the coming 18 months as further new customers come onboard. We are committed to getting the right people and offering an excellent employee benefits package which includes training and opportunities for career development.” By [Matthew Neville](https://bdaily.co.uk/profile/matthew-bdaily) – Senior Correspondent, Bdaily - Add me on - And follow Bdaily on - Submit press releases to [editor@bdaily.co.uk](mailto:editor@bdaily.co.uk)for consideration.
