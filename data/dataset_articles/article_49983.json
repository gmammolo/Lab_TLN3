  "text": "Ondo State Governor Lucky Aiyedatiwa, has promised to pay all outstanding entitlements of workers and ensure the recruitment of health workers despite the lean resources of the state.\nAiyedatiwa gave the promise at the annual prayer organised by civil servants to herald the new working year. He promised the public servants that priority would be given to their welfare in the new year.\nThe governor also promised prompt payment of salaries and inherited arrears, training and retraining, and provision of working tools among other things that will engender an efficient 21st century civil service.\n“We will forge ahead with the approval already given for the recruitment of health workers as a way of strengthening the health sector while filling of vacancies will be done regularly as the need arises”, Aiyedatiwa said.\nHe, however, urged civil servants to face their work diligently and shun partisan politics as the people of the state prepare for another governorship election, adding that politicians should also desist from treating the election as a do-or-die affair.\n“This is an election year; let everyone know that the peace of the state is not negotiable and election is not a do or die affair”, the governor promised to open up the state for investors to come and invest their resources for the progress of the state.\nKayode Ogundele, the Ondo State head of service, commended the governor for his continuous support in all areas about issues affecting public servants in the state.",
