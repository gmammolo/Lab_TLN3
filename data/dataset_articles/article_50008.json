  "text": "POTTSTOWN, Pa. - Nearly 300 registered nurses at Pottstown Hospital have ratified a new three-year contract following more than nine months of negotiations.\nPottstown hospital nurses rally for better contract\nThe vote, held on August 6, resulted in 96% of nurses voting in favor of the agreement.\nThe nurses, represented by Pottstown Nurses United, had scheduled the day for either a strike authorization vote or contract ratification.\nOfficials say the ratified contract focuses on improving nurse recruitment and retention, with the goal of strengthening patient care.\n“We worked hard for a fair contract that respects the work we do, and allows us to care safely for our patients,” said Domin. “We believe we accomplished that goal. We stuck together for what we believe in, and I think that made the difference. We see this as a win for us, for our patients, and for our hospital.”\nThe agreement follows a prolonged bargaining process and applies to the hospital’s nursing staff, including those working in medical-surgical units and other frontline roles.",
