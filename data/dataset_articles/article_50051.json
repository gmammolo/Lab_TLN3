  "text": "TCS wage hikes after job cuts plan: September 1 is the date for 80% of employees\nThe announcement about the wage hike comes just weeks after the IT company revealed its plans to lay off around 12,000 employees this year. In an email to employees on Wednesday, TCS CHRO Milind Lakkad and CHRO Designate K Sudeep informed that the wage hikes will be effective September 1, reported news agency PTI.\nWritten by:\nET Now DigitalUpdated Aug 7, 2025 20:20 IST\nTCS wage hike after job cuts: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has informed its employees about a wage hike for approximately 80 per cent of its workforce.\nTata Consultancy Services(\nTCS), India’s largest IT services company, has informed its employees about a\nwagehike for approximately 80 per cent of its workforce. The\nsalaryincrease will be effective on September 1, 2025, and will cover junior and mid-level staff.\nThe announcement about the wage hike comes just weeks after the\nIT companyrevealed its plans to lay off around 12,000 employees this year. In an email to employees on Wednesday, TCS CHRO Milind Lakkad and CHRO Designate K Sudeep informed that the wage hikes will be effective September 1, reported news agency PTI.\n“We are pleased to announce a compensation revision for all eligible associates in grades upto C3A and equivalent, covering 80 per cent of our workforce. This will be effective 1st September 2025,\" says the email seen by PTI.\nRelated News\n\"We would like to thank each one of you for your dedication and hard work, as we build the future of TCS together,” the mail added.\nHowever, the exact amount of the wage increase has not been disclosed by the company yet,\nAsked for comments, TCS in a statement said, “We can confirm that we will be issuing wage hikes to around 80 per cent of our employees effective 1st September 2025.”\nThe decision to reward and retain talent coincides with the company's decision to lay off over 12,000 or 2 per cent employees of its global workforce, primarily in middle and senior-level roles. TCS has described the\nlayoffsas part of a broader strategic initiative to become a \"future-ready organisation,\" focusing on investments in technologies, AI deployment, market expansion and workforce realignment, according to the company. \"TCS is on a journey to become a future-ready organisation. This includes strategic initiatives on multiple fronts, including investing in new-tech areas, entering new markets, deploying AI at scale for our clients and ourselves, deepening our partnerships, creating next-gen infrastructure, and realigning our workforce model,\" the company had said last month as the news of layoffs shook the IT industry.\n\"Towards this, a number of reskilling and redeployment initiatives have been underway. As part of this journey, we will also be releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible. This will impact about 2 per cent of our global workforce, primarily in the middle and the senior grades, over the course of the year,\" TCS had then said.\nThe layoffs at TCS have infact raised broader questions about the future of the IT industry, especially amid global economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and the growing impact of AI.\nAs it is, India's top IT services companies have delivered single-digit revenue growth in Q1 FY26, capping off a somewhat-sobering June quarter as macroeconomic instability and geopolitical tensions have weighed on global tech demand and delayed client decision-making, reported PTI.\nGet the latest Business News, Stock Markets, IPO Companies News, Breaking News Events on ET Now.
