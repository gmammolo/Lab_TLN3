  "text": "PowerCo, a subsidiary of Volkswagen, launched a hiring campaign Wednesday to begin recruiting thousands of workers for its $7-billion electric vehicle battery plant in St. Thomas. Here are some things to know.\nPowerCo is gearing up to hire for “hundreds of high-quality local jobs,” the company said in a statement, noting it has already doubled its workforce to 200 employees so far this year and aims to a fill a range of positions by year end.\nAn eclectic list of jobs are available to applicants and some of the immediate open positions are building construction leads, IT professionals and engineers as well as sustainability experts.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW “As (PowerCo) grows from 200 to hundreds more people, it’s really the next step towards the huge ramp-up that’s going to happen as we get closer to initial production,” said Sean Dyke, chief executive of the St. Thomas Economic Development Corporation.\nApplicants can find employment opportunities on PowerCo’s website and submit applications for multiple job openings.\nJake Roseman, speaking on behalf of PowerCo, said job listings are open for applications on the company’s website and jobseekers should expect more postings.\n“We have already listed dozens of job openings on our website, and we are looking to fill hundreds more this year,” Roseman said in an email statement.\nThe PowerCo statement said that recruitment efforts would be ramped up in the months ahead through multiple channels, including an advertising blitz on billboards from St. Thomas to London.\nThe plant is expected to employ several thousand employees once fully operational.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW In its statement, PowerCo reiterated the electric vehicle battery plant is on pace to open in 2027.\nAlthough there’s been activity on the site in northeast St. Thomas, PowerCo said the factory would break ground “in the coming weeks.”\nDyke said the opening of the factory is key to creating employment opportunities beyond the electric vehicle battery and automotive industries.\n“Spin-offs can range far and wide, right from direct suppliers to indirect and then, of course, all the way down to restaurants and dry cleaners,” Dyke said.\n“We’re really excited about what’s going to happen here in the future. And I think the future is getting a lot closer, just with announcements like this one . . . From our perspective as a municipality, I think it’s important for people to know that St. Thomas is a great place to work and to live.”\nSt. Thomas Mayor Joe Preston called PowerCo’s hiring push “incredible” for the city, noting the company is a part of a “great industry.”\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Preston said he hasn’t doubted the electric vehicle plant’s opening in St. Thomas despite concerns about the impact of tariffs. He said the employment announcement would help alleviate unease stemming from U.S. imposed levies.\n“PowerCo has been out front saying this is still moving forward in a big way,” Preston said. “PowerCo is pretty happy in St. Thomas, and this shows that they continue to hire great professionals from across Canada and even around the world to work here in St. Thomas at this very large industrial facility.”\nFor those who are interested in applying for a position at PowerCo, visit http://powerco.ca and click “Join us.”\nbwilliams@postmedia.com\nONTARIO NOW NEWSLETTER Get our free new weekly newsletter Error!
