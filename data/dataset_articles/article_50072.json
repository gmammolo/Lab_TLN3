  "text": "IAM Union Shows Powerful Solidarity at LCLAA’s 25th National Convention\nAugust 7, 2025\nThe strength, diversity, and unity of the IAM Union were front and center this week as IAM Union members and leaders gathered at the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement’s (LCLAA) 25th National Membership Convention in Atlanta. IAM Union delegates from across the country participated in a full slate of workshops, panel discussions, and plenary sessions focused on empowering Latino and Latina union members and mobilizing workers for collective action.\nThis year’s theme, “United We Stand: Building Bridges, Breaking Barriers and Protecting Our Legacy” (Construyendo Puentes, Rompiendo Barreras y Protegiendo Nuestro Legado), focused on the urgent challenges facing Latino communities and the labor movement as a whole. From immigration and economic equity to leadership development and workplace justice, the convention served as a powerful reminder that when we uplift one another, the entire movement grows stronger.\nIAM General Secretary-Treasurer Dora Cervantes was featured in the panel discussion “Breaking Barriers and Leading with Purpose: Honoring the Leadership of Latinas in Today’s Labor Movement,” alongside SEIU Secretary-Treasurer Rocío Sáenz and Manassas City Council Member and LiUNA 572 Business Manager Sonia Vásquez Luna. The panel highlighted personal stories of perseverance, leadership, and a call to inspire the next generation of Latinas in labor and civic life.\n“Hardships are what make you strong – there’s no such thing as going back,” said Cervantes, urging young Latinas to stay resilient and lead with purpose in the labor movement.\nThe convention also featured timely workshops on organizing, immigration reform, careers in the building trades, and social justice advocacy. One standout session, “Career and Technical Education: Preparing Latino Workers for the Jobs of the Future,” included IAM Human Rights Director Nicole Fears, who spoke about the IAM’s impactful partnership with Aviation High School in Queens, N.Y. This collaboration provides hands-on aviation training, career guidance, and scholarships to high school students, offering a direct pipeline to good union jobs in the skilled trades.\nLCLAA continues to be a vital voice within the AFL-CIO, uniting Latino labor leaders, activists, and allies in the fight for justice and inclusion.\nDelegates also heard from national labor leaders including AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond, AFGE President Everett Kelley, and AFT President Randi Weingarten, among others, all emphasizing the importance of building a movement rooted in solidarity and shared purpose as policies are being in place to target specific groups.\n“We have to protect our people and this is not just about Latinos,” said LCLAA National President and AFT Executive Vice President Evelyn DeJesus. “An injury to one is an injury to all.”\nAs a proud affiliate of LCLAA and a strong advocate for justice, the IAM remains committed to organizing, educating, and lifting up working people.\n“The labor movement must reflect the strength of all its members – regardless of background, status, or where they come from,” said IAM International President Brian Bryant. “Equity and fairness aren’t just values; they’re commitments that shape everything we fight for. At the IAM, we believe in building a union where every worker has a seat at the table, a voice in the room, and the power to shape their future.”\nFor more information and to join LCLAA, visit lclaa.org.",
