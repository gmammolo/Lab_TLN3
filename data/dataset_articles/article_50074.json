Vince Fong (R-Calif.) led the introduction of the Autonomous Mobility Ensuring Regulation, Innovation, Commerce, and Advancement Driving Reliability in Vehicle Efficiency and Safety, or AMERICA DRIVES, Act. The legislation seeks to establish a commercial automated driving system (ADS) network to modernize supply chain and freight workforce operations.\n“By establishing a federal framework for autonomous trucks and empowering the Department of Transportation to set practical regulations, we can safely scale this emerging technology nationwide,” Fong, a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said last month.\nRELATED: Aurora Earns First Revenue in a Quarter of Milestones\nFong\n“The AMERICA DRIVES Act provides a clear path for adoption across state lines, helping support supply chain efficiency, strengthen domestic commerce, and ensure the United States remains unbeatable in the global marketplace,” the bill sponsor explained. “It’s time to seize the opportunity to chart a safe, innovative path forward for American transportation. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in this effort so we can deliver results for the future of freight.”\nThe bill, which awaits consideration in committee, is meant as a proposal likely to gain consideration during Congress’ crafting of comprehensive highway policy legislation. Approving a multiyear surface transportation bill before a fall 2026 authorizing deadline is a priority for congressional leaders. The most recent highway policy authorization was tucked into the Biden-era $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, commonly known as the bipartisan infrastructure law.\nRELATED: Autonomous Tech Firm Kodiak Clears Runway for Public Launch\nSpecifically, the legislation would establish a federal framework for human drivers in commercial vehicles as well as update federal specifications to reflect ADS-equipped vehicles. The measure also would require federal regulators to agree on terms and guidance designed to facilitate the technology’s adoption. Nearly three dozen states accommodate various levels of autonomous truck testing, analyses or limited deployment.\nA Zoox autonomous robotaxi in San Francisco in December. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)\nThe bill’s primary policy proposal responds to long-standing concerns about a lack of a national framework specific to the emerging technology. Key industry stakeholders applauded the legislation.\nRELATED: Aurora Begins Nighttime Autonomous Truck Service\nDrake\nJohn Drake, vice president of transportation, infrastructure and supply chain policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, noted: “[Autonomous vehicle] technologies promise significant benefits for many Americans — but the lack of federal action in recent years is undermining our global leadership. This legislation advances several common-sense actions that will help advance the promise of AVs — while putting American businesses in a stronger position to compete.”\n“AMERICA DRIVES Act is a welcome and bold step toward a federal policy framework for autonomous vehicles,” argued Jeff Farrah, CEO of the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association. “By embracing the benefits of autonomous trucking, Rep. Fong’s bill will strengthen American supply chains, enhance road safety and keep the United States at the forefront of transportation innovation.”\nRELATED: NHTSA Exempts Amazon's Steering-Wheel-Free Zoox Robotaxi\nAt a recent Senate Commerce Committee hearing, American Trucking Associations addressed the topic with senior policymakers. ATA President Chris Spear affirmed that the trucking federation will “continue to advocate for a strong federal framework for automated vehicle testing and deployment.”\n“Such a federal framework is critical for ensuring the safety and trust of the public and necessary for testing the efficacy of automated vehicles in interstate commerce,” Spear said. “A federal framework also provides clear paths for new and innovative technologies to move from testing to deployment through established DOT processes. This can include exemptions, interpretations, investigations or data requirements designed to ensure safety and build public trust.”\nA Senate version of the bill has yet to be debated.\nWant more news?
