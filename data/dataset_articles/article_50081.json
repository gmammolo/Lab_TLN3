  "text": "Stater Bros. workers reach tentative agreement with grocerStater Bros. workers reach tentative agreement with grocer\nEmployees had been working on expired contract since March\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Stater Bros. Bargaining Committee, which represents more than 12,000 Stater Bros. workers in Southern California, has reached a tentative agreement with the grocer, the group announced on Wednesday.\nThe agreement includes higher wages, increased pension contributions, improved health care, enhanced staffing and safety measures, and more.\nWorkers must now vote on the deal. Had a deal not been reached, it would have been the first strike in the grocer’s history. “We look forward to sharing and discussing the details of this agreement with our coworkers before we make our voices heard during the voting process,” the UFCW Stater Bros. Bargaining Committee said in a statement.\nStater Bros. employees had been working under an expired contract since March. On Monday, some gathered at a store in Pasadena, California, to urge shoppers to boycott the location. Workers had threatened to escalate their actions if a deal was not reached soon.\n“Negotiations were conducted in good faith, with both sides working hard to reach a fair deal that supports our teammates and helps keep prices steady for our customers,” Stater Bros. said in an emailed statement to Supermarket News. “We appreciate the collaborative effort and are encouraged that the union is recommending the agreement for ratification.”\nWorkers had pushed for a deal similar to the one reached in July for 45,000 employees at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions. That new three-year contract includes wage increases, a supplemental pension plan, expanded health care benefits, and improved staffing levels.\nThe union filed charges against Stater Bros. with the National Labor Relations Board. The allegations include:\nUnlawful surveillance of members active in the contract campaign\nDiscrimination against members based on union support\nUnlawful interrogation of members\nRetaliation against union supporters\nBypassing the union to negotiate directly with employees\nFailing to provide information necessary for collective bargaining\nRead more about:\nStater Bros.\nAbout the Author\nYou May Also Like",
