  "text": "Donna Morris shared that successful employees stand out by doing three key things differently.Walmart’s chief people officer Donna Morris says job seekers should avoid being constantly negative if they want to grow in their careers. In a recent interview with CNBC Make It, Morris explained that being a ‘Debbie Downer’ is a red flag for managers. A ‘Debbie Downer’ is a person who is always negative, pessimistic, or critical, especially in situations where others are trying to be positive or hopeful. During the interview, Donna Morris said: “Nobody wants [to hire] a Debbie Downer”, adding that this kind of person is “constantly negative. You know they’re going to show up [and] they’re going to bring the problem, never the solution. I like people who bring the problem and a suggestion for how they might resolve [it.]” Morris explained that this kind of attitude can lead to being left out of new projects or growth opportunities. She added that constant naysaying is a warning sign managers watch out for.However, Morris clarified that people should not fake positivity. It’s unnatural and unrealistic for someone to be happy all the time, she said. But if someone is always negative, it could be a sign that they are in the wrong job or company.3 characteristics that Walmart HR head believes help employees succeedDonna Morris shared that successful employees stand out by doing three key things differently. First, they consistently deliver results on time, or even earlier than expected. “You’re better to deliver early than to deliver late, and you’re better to deliver more than less,” she said.Second, they are proactive and raise their hands to take on new tasks. Bringing problems with possible solutions or asking for help before situations get worse is another positive trait.““Another green flag is they’re open to opportunities, and they put their hand up to take on more. Or they bring a problem with the remedy or request help in a timely manner, as opposed to the house is on fire.”Finally, Morris said that mentoring others and sharing knowledge are strong “green flags” for employees who want to get ahead. “People who you see are actually helping others [are a] total green flag,” she said.",
