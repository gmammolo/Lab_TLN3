  "text": "BENGALURU (Reuters) -India's Tata Consultancy Services will raise salaries for 80% of its workforce, according to an internal email reviewed by Reuters, weeks after announcing layoffs affecting more than 12,000 employees.\nThe annual wage hike, which was due in April, comes at a time when India's $283 billion IT industry is grappling with cautious client spending amid weak global demand, sticky inflation, and uncertainty around U.S. trade policy. TCS last month said clients delayed decisions and projects.\n\"We are pleased to announce compensation revision for all eligible associates in grades up to C3A (assistant consultant) and equivalent, covering 80% of workforce,\" according to the mail to employees from chief human resource officer Milind Lakkad and CHRO designate Sudeep K on Wednesday.\nEmployees, ranging from trainees with a few months of experience, to assistant consultants who have worked for more than a decade, will be eligible for the wage revision.\nHowever, the mail did not share any details about the revisions for senior-level staff that form the rest 20% of the workforce.\n\"We can confirm that we will be issuing wage hikes to around 80% of our employees effective 1st September 2025,\" the Tata Group company said in an email to Reuters, but did not give other details.\nThe April annual hikes were delayed after the Mumbai-based company cited uncertain business environment. In June, the company's attrition level reaching a two-year high of 13.8%.\n(Reporting by Sai Ishwarbharath B; Editing by Harikrishnan Nair)\nBy Sai Ishwarbharath B\n© Reuters - 2025",
