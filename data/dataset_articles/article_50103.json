  "text": "Govt to hold recruitment for group C vacancies in state\nBhubaneswar: The state govt will soon initiate the recruitment process for 22,896 Group-C posts lying vacant across 10 key departments, according to official sources.\nAs per govt rules, any recruitment for Group-C posts requires approval from an empowered committee before requisitions can be sent to recruiting agencies. In a letter to the principal secretary of the finance department, chief secretary Manoj Ahuja urged the department to convene a meeting of the empowered committee and clear the 22,896 vacancies for direct recruitment by August 31.\nWhile the govt has not yet fixed an exact recruitment timeline, sources indicated that appointments are likely to be made by the end of this year.\nMeanwhile, opposition parties have raised concerns. BJD MLA Dhruba Charan Sahoo said, \"Govt cannot recruit staff on time, which affects its functioning. The state secretariat is also facing the same issue.\" Congress MLA Ashok Kumar Das said there is no systematic effort by the govt to recruit people. \"What's the problem in filling up vacant posts?\" he added.\nResponding to the criticism, Law Minister Prithiviraj Harichandan said, \"Recruitment begins once departments report vacancies to the concerned agencies. This process takes time\"\nEarlier, chief minister Mohan Charan Majhi had underlined the need for a flawless, impartial, and speedy recruitment process, especially in departments providing essential services such as health, home, school and mass education, higher education, and agriculture.",
