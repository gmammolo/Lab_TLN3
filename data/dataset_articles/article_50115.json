  "text": "The union representing some 12,000 Stater Bros. employees across Southern California announced Wednesday evening it has reached a tentative contract agreement with the grocery chain.\nThe union workers had previously authorized a strike if a deal could not be reached. No specific details of the proposed agreement were released, although union officials said it includes higher wages, additional pension contributions, better and faster access to health care benefits and improvements in staffing.\n“This victory wouldn’t have been possible without the power of our collective action,” the United Food and Commercial Workers Stater Bros. Bargaining Committee said in a statement.\n“Together, we stood up to the company’s disrespect and made it clear that we are a strong union family, united in solidarity to fight for the contract we deserve. ”\nFurther details of the tentative agreement will be shared exclusively with union members in upcoming meetings, with more information shared with the public after voting is completed, the union said.\nThe agreement was reached after four negotiating sessions in nine days.\n“Negotiations were conducted in good faith, with both sides working hard to reach a fair deal that supports our teammates and holds the line on prices for our customers,” Stater Bros. Markets said in a statement.\n“We appreciate the collaborative effort and are encouraged that the union is recommending the agreement for ratification.”",
