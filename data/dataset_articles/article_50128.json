  "text": "YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (WKBN) – A local business that started in the Valley in 1971 is ready to hire again. Astro Shapes is an aluminum extrusion manufacturing company headquartered in Struthers, with six locations all over the Valley. The company is holding an open house on August 13 at its Struthers and Canfield locations and is looking to hire more than 100 people. “We’re one of the largest manufacturers in this area,” said Kelly Shaffer, vice president of human resources. “Aluminum extrusions for commercial doors, windows, and RVs for building and construction markets.” The company is looking to fill several different positions for all six locations in Struthers, Youngstown, Boardman, Canfield and Columbiana. “We’re looking for entry-level laborers starting at $17 an hour. We’re also looking for maintenance technicians. Those positions start at $26 and have the capability to increase based on their skill knowledge,” said Shaffer. “We run three shifts — midnights: 11 p.m. to 7 a.m., day turn: 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., and afternoons: 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. We’re primarily looking for midnight and afternoon shift employees.” The locations consist of Astro Shapes in Struthers, Star Extruded Shapes and Star Fab in Canfield, Aerolite Extrusions in Boardman, Datco Manufacturing in Boardman, and a division of Star Fab in Columbiana. “We want energetic, reliable people that want to work in manufacturing and that want to launch a career either as a stepping stone or build a career with us long term, because we do have long-term people here,” said Shaffer. “I’m starting to see retirements of my 40-plus-year employees right now. The workforce is changing. We want people that are willing to learn. We’ll teach them.” All of the locations feature state-of-the-art equipment and the company’s core values. “We have a great work atmosphere, we have a great team, core values, we pay well. Take a tour to come see the facilities; they’re beautiful. We’ve invested an awful lot of money into them,” said Shaffer. “We take a lot of pride in our location. We are one of the largest manufacturers here, and we’re proud of it. Potential is there for everybody. It’s a very good company.” The open houses will be held on Wednesday, August 13, at the Astro Shapes Education Center, located at 21 Main Street in Struthers, and at Star Extruded Shapes, located at 7055 Herbert Road in Canfield. The open houses will be held from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and from 4 to 8 p.m. at both locations. For more information, visit AstroShapes.com.
