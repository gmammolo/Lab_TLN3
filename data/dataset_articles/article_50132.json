To read about CWA Members, Leadership or Industries, visit our About page.\nCWA Members Ratify Contract at Call of Duty Video Game Studio\nEarlier this week, on the third anniversary of the opening of bargaining, video game workers at Raven Software unanimously voted to ratify their first union contract with Microsoft. Workers at the studio, who are responsible for the popular Call of Duty game series, were the first Activision Blizzard workers to organize a union with CWA. Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard in early 2023. This ratification builds on recent momentum by CWA members to raise standards across the video game industry, with ZeniMax video game workers ratifying a historic contract with Microsoft in late June.\nThe contract ensures lasting protections in the workplace, including guaranteed double-digit wage increases over two years, the elimination of “crunch time” (extended and excessive mandatory overtime), layoff protections, and more—a first across the video game industry.\n“Going from organizing to sitting across the table from one of the largest tech corporations in the world was a huge learning curve, but we never lost sight of why we were there,” said Raven Software QA tester and CWA Local 4652 bargaining committee member Autumn Prazuch. “We fought hard for raises and job structures that will finally make QA a sustainable career path, and we were able to negotiate limitations on mandatory crunch. Ratifying this contract is a win for game workers everywhere who are ready to take the first step toward a better future.”",
