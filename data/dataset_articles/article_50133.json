To read about CWA Members, Leadership or Industries, visit our About page.\nMental Health Workers Unite for Higher Wages\nFrom July 21 through July 25, members of United Workers of Harris Center-CWA Local 6154 held a week of actions calling for the company to compensate workers fairly. Workers are seeking a $5,000 across-the-board pay raise and a $20 per hour minimum wage.\nIn preparation for the week-long mobilization drive, union activists took to their phones, placing calls and texts to UWHC-CWA members. During the mobilization blitz, members hosted multiple potluck lunches where they provided information on the union, their demands, and the CWA Political Action Fund.\nMembers also engaged workers with:\n- A pay raise lemonade stand\n- A pay raise brunch\n- A taco breakfast for shift workers\n- A social hour for legislative updates and a PAF drive\nActivists signed up 69 new members during the drive, which culminated in a united march on the bosses at their board meeting. Wearing CWA paraphernalia, 16 members testified about their love of their jobs and the services they provide to their community. However, low wages force some workers to hold two or even three additional jobs to make ends meet. The low wages also contribute to low morale and high turnover, further increasing strain on veteran workers. Members asked the Board to support pay raises for all Harris Center workers as a way to increase retention, improve quality of life, and improve delivery of services to the community. Members deliver high-quality mental health services and provide assistance to clients with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities.\nMembers of United Workers of Harris County-CWA Local 6154 participated in a week of actions to build support for a pay raise.",
