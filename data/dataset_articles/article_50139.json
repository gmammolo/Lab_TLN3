  "text": "CHICKASAW, Ala. ( WKRG ) — A Michigan-based welding company is building a facility in Chickasaw, bringing 30 new jobs to the area, according to the Mobile Chamber of Commerce. Dynasty Fab is a leader in “advanced welding and fabrication for the defense, aerospace and automotive sector,” according to the chamber news release. The new facility will be located at the Chickasaw Marine Terminal, with it being the business’s first workshop outside of Michigan. LOCATION The facility will include access to docks and large-scale manufacturing capabilities, according to the release. “Expanding to Chickasaw is a milestone for Dynasty Fab and a necessary step in our mission\nto deliver precision fabrication at scale,” said Zach Jeakle, owner of Dynasty Fab. “The Port of Chickasaw gives us access to maritime shipping and a skilled regional workforce, which will allow us to better serve our defense and industrial clients across the Gulf Coast and beyond.” President and CEO of the chamber, Bradley Byrne, said this expansion is a big step forward for Chickasaw. “This investment strengthens our region’s position as a hub for advanced manufacturing and reflects our momentum in attracting companies that thrive on innovation,” said Byrne. Their position on the dock will allow them to “fabricate and ship oversized components by water, a key advantage for customers in the maritime and defense sector,” read the release. “This new industry is a result of years of collaboration with stakeholders and the major\nimprovements in our infrastructure,” said Chickasaw Mayor Barry Broadhead. “For the citizens, this will be added job opportunities right here at home. We look forward to many years of partnership with this new company and the growth opportunities it brings to our city.” The release said operations are expected to begin this month.
