  "text": "The United Steelworkers union and oil companies that employ union members will soon begin negotiating new contracts, including for workers at the BP Whiting Refinery.\nThe USW convened its National Oil Bargaining Conference in Pittsburgh this week to prepare for negotiations. Union leaders from around the world met to discuss priorities, goals and strategy going into the latest round of contract talks.\n\"Delegates from each local union met in regional and employer groups to talk about the top issues impacting you,\" the USW said in an update to members. \"These meetings help shape our national bargaining goals.\"\nThe USW's elected policy committee then met to develop a proposed national bargaining agenda that factors in ideas pitched by local union representatives.\nThe new contract will cover most of the about 1,800 workers at the BP Whiting Refinery, setting their pay, benefits, safety training, safety guidelines and other working conditions.\nThe union negotiated the current contract in 2022. It included 12% raises.\nUnion leaders spent the week in Pittsburgh taking part in workshops on labor law, mid-contract negotiations and strike preparation. They discussed and refined a national bargaining agenda that will guide the contract talks with BP, Shell, ExxonMobil and other oil companies.\nThe USW voted Thursday to adopt the union's 2026 National Oil Bargaining policy, and will present it to all members to review and ratify.\n\"BP looks forward to negotiating five contracts with the USW in January 2026,\" company spokesman Cesar Rodriguez said. \"We remain committed to bargaining in good faith and will continue to focus on the best interests of Whiting and our local operations.\"\nPHOTOS: USW crashes US Steel CEO appearance, rallies for fair contract\nUnited Steelworkers union members rally for fair contract\nUnited Steelworkers union members rally for fair contract\nUnited Steelworkers union members rally for fair contract\nUnited Steelworkers union members rally for fair contract\nUnited Steelworkers union members rally for fair contract\nUnited Steelworkers union members rally for fair contract",
