  "text": "A skilled, agile and productive workforce aligned to employer needs is critical for Australia’s productivity uplift. Workforce skills and capabilities enable the innovation, competitiveness and business investment that will underpin our quality of life for decades to come.\nThe identification of skills as an area of focus for the upcoming Economic Reform Roundtable is important. However, skills development in and of itself is not a magic solution for lifting productivity. Over recent decades, levels of formal post-school education have increased notably, at a time when productivity could best be described as anaemic.\nAustralian Industry Group, through its dedicated Centre for Education and Training, has a longstanding focus on driving productivity through skills and workforce development. The Centre’s evidence-based and industry-informed research and advice has focussed heavily on topics such as creating a connected and coherent tertiary system, strengthening work-integrated learning, building foundation skills and developing degree apprenticeships.\nImportant progress has been made. Significant reform has been progressed across Australia’s post-school education and training system in recent years, underpinned by substantial investment. We must continue on this path, with a sharp focus on aligning policy and investment settings with the importance of productivity as a national priority.\nThe connection between education and training and the workplace is essential to drive productivity. Governments, industry and individuals themselves all have a role to play in sharing in the costs and the benefits of this skills development and lifelong learning.\nThis paper calls for skills and workforce policy in Australia to shift towards a more economic focus that drives productivity by more closely connecting education and training with the workplace. Six key actions can drive this agenda forward, in consultation with industry:",
