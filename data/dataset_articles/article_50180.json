There are large crowds, with some workers waiting the whole day. Thousands are at the Smart Tax Center,” a Myanmar worker in Thailand said.\nAccording to the Labour Attaché office, CI book issuing camps have been opened in Samut Sakhon, Samut Prakan, Surat Thani, and Chiang Mai. The program, jointly organized by the Thai and Myanmar governments, covers CI book renewal for workers whose documents have less than six months’ validity remaining, have expired, or need replacement.\nIn line with Thailand’s TR-38 process, eligible workers will receive new CI books, and those presenting their original National Identification Card, household registration, and CI book will be issued a “Passport for Thailand Only” and OWIC card after identity verification.\nThe Labor Attaché Office stated that the camps will be closed on Mondays and on Myanmar Embassy-designated holidays. CI books for Myanmar workers in Thailand are valid for four years from the date of issuance, and the Thai government requires at least six months’ validity remaining to apply for a work permit card.\nRelated Articles News Gold shop owner shot dead in Mudon robbery; daughter injured News Myanmar faces $11 billion in earthquake damage, equivalent to 14 percent of the country’s GDP: World Bank News YGEA warns substandard gold from Hong Kong being imported and sold in local market News 2025 university entrance exam results announced with 48.06% pass rate News Three, including children, killed and six injured in KIA and PDF artillery attack in Shwegu Township News Myanmar workers arrested in Malaysia following neighbourhood complaints Most Read Heavy rains and strong winds expected in some regions and states from August 10 to 15: DMH Paunglaung Dam water level at 2.29 feet, no risk to dam strength or local safety Shan State Chief Minister meets Wa and Mong La leaders to discuss development initiatives MMPO warns members against involvement in online gambling and illegal Ads Foreign envoys sign book of condolence for Late Pro Tem President U Myint Swe UEC announces election bylaws for Pyithu Hluttaw, Amyotha Hluttaw, and Region/State Hlutta...
