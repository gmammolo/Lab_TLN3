  "text": "Lazada e-Services Philippines Inc. has dropped its appeal and settled a labor case with a former delivery rider.\nThe company withdrew its petition before the Court of Appeals on June 24, according to court documents.\nThe move followed a ruling by the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), which found that the rider, John Ckeneth C. Gloriaga, should be considered a regular employee rather than an independent contractor.\nThe NLRC’s decision was based on a Supreme Court-backed framework that applies a four-fold test to determine employee status, including the company’s control over the worker’s conduct.\nLazada initially filed its petition for certiorari on March 5, contesting the NLRC’s finding of wrongful termination.\nThe Court of Appeals on August 5 ordered the case closed following a compromise agreement between the parties.",
