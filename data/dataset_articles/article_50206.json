  "text": "The Allan Labor Government is helping Beaufort businesses to better attract and retain workers across local industries, with work starting on 10 new worker houses to help boost local service delivery and economic growth.\nMember for Ripon Martha Haylett today joined local builders Hotondo Homes Ararat and GJ Gardner Homes Ballarat to officially launch construction at the site, which is being supported by the Labor Government's Regional Worker Accommodation Fund.\nConfigured in two or three-bedroom layouts, the completed homes will offer rental options for both long-term and seasonal workers and their families, especially those in agriculture, healthcare, construction and manufacturing.\nThe houses will also reduce reliance on workers from Ballarat and beyond to fill local jobs, providing employment opportunities that are not as reliant on access to transport. As part of this project, water, electricity, gas, sewerage and internet connections will also be installed at the Burke Street site and the adjacent building lot.\nThese important works, along with funding from the Australian Government, will enable Pyrenees Shire Council to further pursue the development of even more housing and laying the groundwork for future economic development in the town.\nThe Beaufort worker houses are another example of the Regional Worker Accommodation Fund backing regional suppliers to deliver solutions to worker housing shortages. The development will support local jobs across Hotondo Homes and GJ Gardner Homes, ensuring the project is delivered by and for regional workers.\nThis locally led approach is a key feature of projects being supported by the Labor Government across the regions and ensures regional communities have access to the skills and workforces they need to thrive.\nThe Government's support for the project is part of a record $47 billion investment in just over a decade to drive economic growth and make Victoria's regions even better places to live, work, stay, experience, invest and study. For more information, visit rdv.vic.gov.au.\nAs stated by Minister for Regional Development Jaclyn Symes\n\"I'm pleased to see the start of construction for these houses, which will bring more seasonal and long-term workers to Beaufort and help local businesses and community members to thrive.\"\nAs stated by Member for Ripon Martha Haylett\n\"We know that a strong economy is one where jobs are created and supported where they're needed most. That's what we're doing for Beaufort and other communities through our Regional Worker Accommodation Fund.\"\nAs stated by Pyrenees Shire Council CEO Jim Nolan\n\"By helping to increase our housing stock, the Victorian Government's Regional Worker Accommodation Fund provides opportunities for employees to live and work in our community, which will have positive flow-on effects for our population and economy.\"\nAs stated by Hotondo Homes Ararat Manager Russell Pearse\n\"Hotondo Homes is looking forward to helping complete the Beaufort Key Worker Accommodation Project, funded by the Victorian Government's Regional Worker Accommodation Fund - this will be a fantastic boost for Pyrenees Shire, and we are proud to be associated with its creation.\"\nAs stated by GJ Gardner Homes Ballarat Director Nathan Cavanagh\n\"We're excited to partner with the Pyrenees Shire and the Victorian Government to deliver new dwellings in Beaufort that will provide much-needed worker accommodation. This collaboration supports local employment and strengthens the region's capacity to attract and retain essential workers.\"\nhere.",
