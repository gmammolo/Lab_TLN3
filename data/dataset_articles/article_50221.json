  "text": "The Honourable Gerry Byrne, Minister of Jobs, Immigration and Growth, today announced two major initiatives to strengthen Newfoundland and Labrador’s skilled trades workforce: a $3.54 million investment to support women apprentices through social enterprise, and the launch of a new Online Journeyperson and Apprentice Registry to improve labour mobility and credential verification across Canada.\nAdvancing Women in Skilled Trades Through Social Enterprise\nThe Department of Jobs, Immigration and Growth is investing $3.54 million under the Research and Innovation program to support the Office to Advance Women Apprentices (OAWA) in launching a transformative initiative: Exploring Social Enterprise as a Pathway Through Apprenticeship.\nThe three-year project will create an all-female renovation crew operating under a social enterprise, helping women apprentices gain hands-on experience and work toward Red Seal certification. The crew will focus on, but not be limited to, delivering services to vulnerable populations – including survivors of domestic violence, seniors and persons with disabilities – while fostering leadership and mentorship in the skilled trades.\nKey features include:\n- Hiring three female journeypersons and 12 apprentices in carpentry, plumbing and electrical trades.\n- Providing safety training, mentorship, and customer service supports.\n- Partnering with the Newfoundland and Labrador Workforce Innovation Centre to guide project sustainability.\n- Exploring revenue streams such as renovations, subscription-based maintenance, branded merchandise and DIY workshops.\nThe Office to Advance Women’s Apprentices aims to achieve financial sustainability by the end of the funding period, reinvesting revenue into training and workforce development. Since 2009, the organization has supported over 2,300 tradeswomen and helped more than 230 achieve Red Seal certification.\nThis investment is supported through the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Labour Market Development Agreement.\nOnline Registry Enhancing Labour Mobility\nMinister Byrne also announced the launch of the Newfoundland and Labrador Online Journeyperson and Apprentice Registry, a new digital initiative that will improve labour mobility and streamline credential verification for skilled tradespeople across Canada.\nThe registry allows employers, apprentices, journeypersons and apprenticeship authorities to quickly confirm certification status online using a simple search requiring the individual’s first name, last name and certificate or apprenticeship number.\nThe registry supports national efforts to improve labour mobility by helping people get to work faster. Newfoundland and Labrador joins British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario in offering this public digital service. It’s part of a broader push to make it easier for tradespeople to move and work across the country.\nThe registry is publicly accessible at www.tradespersonregistry.gov.nl.ca. Individuals can opt out at any time by emailing app@gov.nl.ca with their name, credential number, birth date and registration or certification date. Requests will be processed within two business days.\nQuotes\n“These initiatives reflect our commitment to building a skilled, inclusive and mobile workforce in Newfoundland and Labrador. By supporting women in trades through an innovative social enterprise and launching a digital registry that speeds up hiring and credential recognition, we’re helping more people access opportunity and building a more responsive workforce that can meet demand across the country.”\nHonourable Gerry Byrne\nMinister of Jobs, Immigration and Growth\n“Empowering women to thrive in skilled trades through social enterprise is about building a stronger, more resilient workforce for our province. By opening new pathways to opportunity, we are helping to meet the growing demand for skilled workers. This is an investment in our people and our economy.”\nHonourable Sherry Gambin-Walsh\nMinister Responsible for Women and Gender Equality\n“This investment marks a pivotal moment for women in skilled trades across Newfoundland and Labrador. By launching a social enterprise led by tradeswomen, we’re not only creating meaningful employment opportunities, we’re building a model of mentorship, leadership and community impact. The Office to Advance Women Apprentices is proud to partner with the Department of Jobs, Immigration and Growth to empower women on their journey to Red Seal certification, while delivering essential services to our communities. This initiative is a bold step toward a more inclusive and resilient skilled trades workforce.”\nLori LeDrew\nExecutive Director, Office to Advance Women Apprentices\n“The launch of the registry will allow employers to confirm the qualifications of tradespeople and support them in getting on the job site quicker. Moving between jurisdictions can sometimes be challenging, but this registry will remove some of the impediments to tradesperson mobility.”\nShawn Skinner\nTraining Director, Carpenters Millwright College\n-30-",
