  "text": "Food Services- 2 min read\nHow Barista Coffee is planning to drive 25–30 pc revenue jump this fiscal\nBarista Coffee, aiming for Rs 400 crore in revenue this fiscal year with a 25-30% jump, is expanding through franchise networks and vending businesses. The coffee chain is focusing on healthy food and beverages, merchandising, and quick commerce to fuel growth. With 480 stores across 165 cities, Barista plans to reach 520 stores by year-end and diversify its regional presence.\nBarista Coffee, which claims to be the only coffee chain in India that has been clocking double-digit like-to-like growth, is eyeing to close this fiscal with Rs 400 crore in revenue,\nRajat Agrawal, CEO, Barista Coffee told ETRetail.\nThe brand, which closed last fiscal with approx. Rs 290 crore in revenue, is eyeing to close this fiscal with a 25-30 per cent jump.\nElaborating on the factors helping the brand grow, he said, \"Rationalising product portfolio, betting big on\nhealthy food and beverages, merchandising and non-coffee portfolio, expansion via franchise network, increasing ticket size, and expansion into the vending business and\nquick commercehave been the big focus areas for us.\"\nThe brand, which offers 20-30 per cent non-coffee beverages, claims its blended average online v/s dine-in stands at 55:45, and its average order value ranges between Rs 425- Rs 475.\n\"At present, 23-24 per cent of our business comes from food, and the remaining is contributed by beverages and merchandising. The stores, where we have started offering fresh food, have seen at least a 5-6 per cent surge in demand,\" he said.\nCurrently, 10 per cent of the stores of the brand have a\nlive kitchen.\n\"There are proprietary as well as some of the co-branded products which we offer contribute 5-10 per cent to the overall revenue,\" he further added.\nThe brand, which runs 480 stores in more than 165 cities, plans to close this fiscal year with 520 stores.\n\"On a run-rate basis, we open 55-65 outlets every year. Going ahead, we plan to consolidate our presence and focus on having a presence in 200 cities in the next 3-4 years,\" he stated.\n\"At present, approx. 65 per cent of our outlets are concentrated in the North; however, over the next 3-4 years, we envision changing this ratio to 55 per cent in the North and 45 per cent in the remaining parts of the country,\" he further added.\nThe brand, which forayed into the quick commerce 7-8 months ago, is currently present at\nAmazonand Blinkit and plans to expand its presence on Zepto and Big Basket.\n\"Currently, we offer 6 SKUs on Amazon and 4 SKUs on Blinkit, and they contribute less than 2-3 per cent of our overall revenue; however, over the next 2 years, we plan to scale it to 5 per cent,\" he asserted.\nWhen asked about the increasing\ncoffee prices, he said, \"Coffee prices have nearly doubled in a year, significantly impacting operating costs. We have implemented our routine annual price hike, partially passing on the increased costs to consumers. However, the full burden hasn’t been shifted, keeping pricing competitive. We expect some relief in coffee prices by November–December as more supply is expected to come in from Vietnam and Brazil.\"",
