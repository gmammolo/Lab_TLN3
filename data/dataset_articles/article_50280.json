  "text": "Capsol Technologies has signed a contract to deliver a feasibility study evaluating the use of CapsolEoP® (End-of-Pipe) for a European lime player - opening a new segment for future growth. Capsol will deliver a feasibility study evaluating the using of CapsolEoP? at a European lime plant with the potential to capture several hundred thousand tonnes of CO2 annually, supporting the client's decarbonization strategy.\nLime is a key input for sectors including steel, glass, construction, agriculture, pulp and paper, and chemicals. According to the European Lime Association (EuLA), the sector aims to deploy carbon capture technologies for 5-10% of kiln-related CO2 emissions by 2030, with full capture of unavoidable process emissions by 2050. With the integration of carbon capture and storage (CCS), including BECCS and carbonation, the European lime sector aims to become net-negative - permanently removing up to 5 million tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere each year.\n© S&P Capital IQ - 2025",
