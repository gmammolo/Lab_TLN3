  "text": "4 February 2022\nThe Chair of Cleveland Police Federation has said he is looking forward to working with the new Chief Constable, who he said had “a wealth of policing experience”.\nMark Webster, the current Deputy Chief Constable of Cumbria, has been named as the Police and Crime Commissioner’s preferred candidate for Cleveland Chief Constable, and his selection could be approved later this month.\nSteve Williams-Reader, Chair of Cleveland Police Federation, said: “I was fortunate to represent Cleveland Police Federation on a stakeholder panel interviewing Mark Webster.\n“Mr Webster clearly has a wealth of policing experience representing a number of forces and the National Crime Agency. During his interview, he expressed a strong desire to include the Federation in his role as Cleveland Chief Constable.\n“Cleveland Police Federation is looking forward to working alongside Mr Webster. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to Acting Chief Constable Helen McMillan for her help and support.”\nMr Webster became an officer in 1992 with Greater Manchester Police and has previously served as director of intelligence and operations at the National Crime Agency.\nCleveland's Police and Crime Commissioner Steve Turner said: \"I am delighted to select Mark as my preferred candidate for the role of Chief Constable. At every stage of the assessment process, Mark proved himself as a talented and dedicated police leader with a wealth of experience in operational policing.\n\"Cleveland is not an easy place to police and therefore we needed a process that was going to put candidates to the test and draw out their extensive skills and experience.\"",
