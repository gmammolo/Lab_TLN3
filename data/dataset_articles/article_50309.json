  "text": "10 July 2024\nPolice officers have voted overwhelmingly in favour of their Federation representatives campaigning for collective bargaining on pay.\nMore than 50,000 officers responded to a poll run by the Police Federation of England and Wales asking them whether they should pursue negotiation with binding arbitration when determining police pay.\nAnd an astonishing 97.7% of those polled agreed that the PFEW should pursue such rights.\nCalum Macleod, PFEW National Secretary, said: “This strong mandate from the membership sets us up to negotiate with the new government a fair and binding pay mechanism.\n“Thank you to those who participated. PFEW’s National Council and National Board will begin creating a campaign for the introduction of a fair and binding pay mechanism on the behalf of our members.\n“We realise a political agreement to change process can take time, but a new Government allows us the opportunity to take a fresh view on those issues that matter most to our members. We will keep you updated with progress.”\nThe poll, which ran from 3-21 June for Federated members, received 50,103 responses, with 97.7% in favour of wanting PFEW to campaign for collective bargaining with binding arbitration.",
