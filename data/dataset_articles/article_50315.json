  "text": "Dear Editor: I walked the picket lines with the Meriter nurses earlier this year, and I support the GHC nurses in their unionization efforts.\nI owe these nurses a debt I cannot repay. Two years ago, their care saved my life from a vicious bacterial infection.\nI believe GHC nurses when they tell me their management, led by Marc Huth, has been silencing, intimidating and overworking them. It's plain as day that GHC management, again led by Huth, deliberately hired an expensive anti-labor attack-dog law firm.\nAs a longtime GHC member, I can directly see how understaffing and turnover have damaged the timeliness of routine care. I have also witnessed GHC refusing outright to listen to me or engage with my concerns about their union-busting, in stark defiance of their \"cooperative\" brand.\nMark Huth's mendacious call in the Cap Times for a unionization vote after flooding the unit is classic anti-labor maneuvering.\nI call on GHC to recognize the nurses' union without further delay. I also call on GHC to fire Huth immediately. For optimal health I need well-treated, well-compensated nurses much more than I need anti-labor management shenanigans.\nDorothea Salo\nMadison",
