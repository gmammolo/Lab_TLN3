  "text": "From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja\nThe Federal Government said it has paid the second tranche of the N35,000 wage award arrears to its workers.\nThe Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF), disclosed this in a statement issued by its Spokesperson, Bawa Mokwa on Friday.\nAccording to the statement, the government had earlier settled one month out of the initial five months owed, noting that with the latest payment, only three tranches remain.\nIt dismissed claims that the government had abandoned the payment, insisting it would continue to pay in monthly instalments of N35,000 until the arrears are cleared.\nThe Office assured workers that the commitment to offset the wage award arrears remains intact.",
