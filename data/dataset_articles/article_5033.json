  "text": "SASHAKT POLICE, SASHAKT SAMAAJ: Health Camp for Police Personnel Held at Wagholi Police Station\nPune, 29th January 2026: Under the “Sashakt Police, Sashakt Samaaj” initiative, a comprehensive health check-up camp for police personnel and their families was organised at Wagholi Police Station on January 28, 2026. The camp focused on preventive healthcare and included eye testing, dental check-ups, random blood sugar testing, and blood donation.\nThe project was conceptualised by Rtn Neeta Kaul Razdan and supported by a team of medical and Rotary volunteers, including Rtn Dr Seema Khaire, Dr Mridul, Dr Ishita, Rtn Vikas Haijan, Rtn Anup Mittal and Vishal Palit from the blood bank.\nSpeaking about the initiative, Rtn Neeta Kaul Razdan said, “Police personnel work under constant pressure and long hours. Their health often takes a back seat. Through ‘Sashakt Police, Sashakt Samaaj’, our aim is to ensure that those who protect society also get timely and quality healthcare.”\nFour separate booths were set up for each category of check-up, with a dedicated room for eye examinations. Cafe Bistro provided a hamper for the entire police station and the organising team.\nAround 80 police personnel and family members benefited from the camp. While blood donation turnout was limited due to duty schedules, the eye testing, dental check-ups and random blood sugar tests saw strong participation and positive feedback from the attendees.\nThe initiative also strengthened ties between the Rotary Club of Pune Kharadi (RCPK) and the police. Officials from Wagholi Police Station have proposed conducting a cyber crime awareness lecture for RCPK members and Interact Clubs in Kharadi in the near future.\nPresident Col. Kulbir who is the President of RCPK, thanked all the volunteers and doctors for their efforts and said the club is planning to organise a larger health camp in future to benefit more people from the surrounding villages.\nShe also expressed gratitude to Senior Police Inspector Yuvraj Hande and his team at Wagholi Police Station for their full cooperation despite a busy work schedule. Special thanks were extended to Ayucare Diagnostic Hospital, Viman Nagar, KK Hospital, Kharadi, and Cafe Bistro for supporting the initiative as a service to society.",
