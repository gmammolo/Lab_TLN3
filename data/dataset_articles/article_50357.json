  "text": "VFS Global becomes sole provider for South African passport renewal applications in UAE\nDubai: South African nationals living in the UAE can now conveniently renew their passports at the VFS Global Visa Application Centre in Wafi City, Dubai, following a new partnership with the South Africa Department of Home Affairs, effective July 2025.\nVFS Global is now the sole outsourced service provider for South African passport renewal applications in the UAE, eliminating the need for residents to visit the Consulate General in Dubai. Applications may now be submitted either at the VFS Global centre in Dubai or at the Embassy of South Africa in Abu Dhabi.\nMonaz Billimoria, Regional Head – UAE at VFS Global, said: \"We are excited to be offering passport renewal services for South African nationals living in the UAE. We thank the Department of Home Affairs for their steadfast faith in our services over the past 15 years. We are confident that applicants will enjoy an enhanced customer experience when they visit us at the world's largest centre here in Dubai.\"\nTo apply, visit https://services.vfsglobal.com/are/en/zap, select “Apply for Consular services → Passport”, and book an appointment.\nApplicants must prepare all required documents listed on the site, and visit the centre at their scheduled time to submit documents, complete biometric enrolment, and pay the applicable fees.\nApplications are processed in South Africa and returned to the VFS Global centre in Dubai. Status updates can be tracked online using the reference number.\nApplicants are strongly advised to apply at least 12 months before their current passport expires. The processing time is estimated at 8 to 10 weeks, though delays may occur. Travel plans should be avoided until the new passport is received.\nFor added convenience, VFS Global offers optional services such as Premium Lounge access, professional form-filling assistance, SMS/email alerts, photocopying and printing, and Prime Time appointments outside regular hours. These services incur additional fees but do not affect processing times or application outcomes.\nSign up for the Daily Briefing\nGet the latest news and updates straight to your inbox",
