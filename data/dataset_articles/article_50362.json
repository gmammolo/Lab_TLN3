  "text": "Emirates, the world’s largest international and most profitable airline, is scouting for top-tier aircraft engineering and technical talent worldwide.\nThe airline’s next official stop is India, where it is hosting information sessions in Mumbai and Bengaluru from 19 to 24 August. These two key roles – aircraft technicians and licensed aircraft engineers – are based in Dubai, says a release.\nThe roadshows come on the back of the Emirates Group’s global recruitment drive to onboard 17,300 professionals across 350 roles this financial year. This strategic move underscores Emirates’ commitment to expanding its technical operations and elevating maintenance standards across its international fleet. The recruitment initiative spans two key Indian cities, tapping into one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation talent pools, the release said.\nMohammad Sarhan, Emirates Airlines VP – India and Nepal, said: “Our engineers enjoy a rewarding career in Dubai, working on the world’s largest fleet of widebody aircraft as part of a dynamic, multicultural team of talented professionals. We have invested $950 million to build a new ultra-modern engineering facility at Dubai World Central.|”\nConstruction on Phase 1 of Emirates’ engineering facility at Dubai World Central began in 2024 with an expected completed time of 2027. Spread over 1 million square metres, it is purpose-built to support Emirates’ aircraft fleet and operating requirements into the 2040s, the release said.\nPublished on August 8, 2025\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.
