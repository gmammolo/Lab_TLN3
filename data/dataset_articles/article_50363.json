  "text": "PUTRAJAYA: The Multiple Entry Visa (MEV) facility for Bangladeshi workers officially takes effect today.\nThe Home Ministry confirmed the new measure applies to workers with valid Temporary Employment Visit Passes (PLKS) and Single Entry Visas (SEV).\nNo separate MEV application is required for eligible workers this year.\nThe Immigration Department will handle MEV issuance during PLKS renewals next year.\nThis system aims to improve oversight of foreign worker movements while reducing visa misuse risks.\nThe ministry expects the change to ease congestion at Malaysian embassies abroad.\nThe MEV facility underscores Malaysia’s commitment to ethical labour cooperation with Bangladesh.\nIt also aligns with efforts to protect foreign workers’ rights under local and international laws. - Bernama",
