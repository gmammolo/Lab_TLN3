  "text": "Campaign also launches to address growing issue of excessive heat in workplaces\nNewfoundland and Labrador is ensuring that both companies and employees are aware of workers’ rights.\nThe \"Your Rights at Work\" campaign aims to help employers understand their responsibilities under provincial labour legislation, while also informing workers—particularly young and non-unionized employees—of their rights in the workplace.\n“Every year, thousands of young people enter the workforce for the first time. It is important that they understand their rights and protections under the Labour Standards Act, and that employers are equally informed of their responsibilities. This campaign is about raising awareness and ensuring both workers and employers know where to go for accurate information and support,” said Pam Parsons, Minister of Labour.\n“With more than 25,000 non-unionized workers aged 15 to 24 in Newfoundland and Labrador, this campaign is designed to reach this demographic through printed materials and a series of social media posts to help build fair and informed workplaces.”\nThe Labour Standards Act is designed to provide protection to individual workers while requiring employers to establish conditions of employment that meet at least the legislated minimum standards for their employees.\nUpdated booklet on labour standards\nAs part of the campaign, the government of Newfoundland and Labrador has released an updated Labour Standards booklet that outlines the rights and responsibilities of both employees and employers under the act.\nThe booklet—available online here—will also be available in print at employment centres throughout the province. To further raise awareness, posters and bookmarks will also be distributed to employment centres and schools, said the provincial government.\nInterested parties can also request a copy of the Your Rights at Work booklet by contacting Labour Standards at (877) 563-1063 or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0c406d6e63797e5f786d62686d7e687f4c6b637a226260226f6d).\nIn late 2024, Newfoundland and Labrador’s government announced proposed changes to its Labour Standards Act that would significantly strengthen job-protected leave for employees facing serious health issues, injuries, or those who serve in the military.\nHeat stress campaign\nIn July, the Newfoundland and Labrador Federation of Labour (NLFL) also launched a workplace heat stress campaign to address the growing issue of excessive heat in workplaces.\n“Heat exposure is a life-threatening occupational hazard with serious short- and long-term consequences – and it can escalate dangerously fast,” said NLFL President Jessica McCormick. “As our planet warms, heat stress is becoming a workplace crisis within the broader climate crisis. Workers must know their rights, employers must take immediate action to protect them, and governments must implement strong policies to ensure worker safety.”\nThe campaign focuses on three key priorities:\n- Educating workers on the signs and dangers of heat stress, as well as their legal rights to a safe workplace;\n- Collecting worker experiences through an online survey and a “Share Your Story” form to document how heat impacts their health and their work; and\n- Demanding action from employers and governments to implement stronger protections against extreme heat.\n“This summer, we’ll be engaging with workers, on the ground and online, to hear firsthand how heat stress affects them, how the situation has changed in recent years, whether employers are taking proper precautions, and what more must be done to keep workers safe,” said McCormick. “Many workers in our province face extreme heat at work, whether indoors or outdoors, and the situation will only get worse as climate change makes our summers hotter. The information we gather and the conversations we have will drive our fight for change.”\nIn mid-2024, workers at a huge power plant in Newfoundland and Labrador were evacuated as a wildfire raged within the province.",
