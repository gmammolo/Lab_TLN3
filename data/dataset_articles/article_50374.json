  "text": "Accountant-General of the Federation, Shamseldeen Ogunjimi\nThe Federal Government has begun disbursing the second tranche of the N35,000 wage award arrears to civil servants, reaffirming its commitment to meeting obligations to federal workers.\nIn a statement on Friday in Abuja, the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF) confirmed the disbursement, stating that the payment was part of the outstanding wage award introduced to cushion the impact of economic reforms on public sector employees.\nMr. Bawa Mokwa, Director of Press and Public Relations at the OAGF, said the government had earlier settled one month’s arrears out of the total five months owed to federal workers under the wage award arrangement. The payment of the second tranche reduces the outstanding balance to three months.\nThe N35,000 monthly wage award was introduced as a temporary palliative measure following the removal of fuel subsidies and other reforms that significantly affected the cost of living. It was agreed upon during negotiations between the Federal Government and organised labour to ease the financial burden on workers pending a new minimum wage structure.\nResponding to speculation that the Federal Government had abandoned the wage award, the Accountant General’s office dismissed such claims, maintaining that the administration has not defaulted on its promise. The office clarified that payments are being made in phases and will continue until the full arrears are cleared.\n“The Federal Government has not reneged on its obligation. The wage award arrears will continue to be paid in instalments of N35,000 per month until the outstanding balance is completely settled,” the statement said.\nThe assurance comes at a time when labour unions and public sector workers have been mounting pressure on the government for improved wage conditions amid rising inflation and economic challenges.\nThe gradual settlement of the wage award arrears may help ease tensions between labour and government, although broader discussions on salary adjustments and public sector welfare are still ongoing.",
