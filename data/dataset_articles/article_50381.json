  "text": "Australian shipping service provider Sendle has announced a three-way merger with US logistics companies FirstMile and ACI Logistix to form a new entity, FAST Group, that will support e-commerce businesses of all sizes.\nHeadquartered in California, with teams across the USA, Australia, Canada, India and the Philippines, FAST Group will leverage the combined knowledge, technology , infrastructure and operational experience of the three carriers. Each company will continue to operate under its established brand, all while functioning as a single, integrated and expanded logistics ecosystem.\nACI Logistix CEO Keith Somers will oversee the FAST Group as CEO, and the board will comprise representatives from all three companies.\nSomers said, “Each of these three companies has a proud history of cultivating distinct strengths and deep insights into their respective customer needs. By combining our capabilities under FAST Group, we’re creating a complete and powerful logistics ecosystem that can support customers through their entire growth path, as they adapt and compete in an ever-evolving e-commerce landscape.\n“This strategic merger, backed by Federation Asset Management, will bring added benefits for customers across all segments – SMB, mid-market and enterprise – through improved first-mile pickups, faster and complete national distribution and integrated customer support. It also presents exciting opportunities for our partners, including other carriers and technology providers, as we look to deliver more services, more innovation and more national impact.”\nIn related news, from September 2025, all online shops in Austria will be able to offer customers the new PostPay payment option at checkout following a successful trial by Austrian Post on its own online marketplace",
