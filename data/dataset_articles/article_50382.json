  "text": "“Earning the certification as a Great Place to Work for the seventh time reflects our consistent commitment to our people and the values that define us as a company, and validates that we’ve built something enduring,” said Ryan Marshall, President and CEO of PulteGroup. “Even in dynamic market conditions, we continue investing in what drives our success, and that’s our people. They show up with dedication and integrity every day, for each other and the company. I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished together.”\nBuilt on a 75-year foundation of putting people first, PulteGroup's culture centers on the belief that building quality homes starts with building each other up through mutual respect and support. Examples of this can be seen through voluntary Business Resource Groups, community initiatives like the Built to Honor program, which provides mortgage-free homes to veterans, and a genuine commitment to helping teammates grow both personally and professionally. It's a culture where people don't just work together, they show up for each other and take pride in making a meaningful impact.\n\"What makes this recognition extra meaningful is that it comes directly from the voices of our teammates based on their own personal experiences,” said Kevin Henry, Chief People Officer. “We've always believed that when you genuinely invest in people, they invest back tenfold. Whether through our Business Resource Groups, community involvement, or the way teammates support one another, you can feel the authenticity of our culture. When people choose to build their careers with us year after year, that tells the real story.\"\nGreat Place To Work® is the global authority on workplace culture, employee experience, and the leadership behaviors proven to deliver market-leading revenue, employee retention and increased innovation.\n\"Great Place To Work Certification is a highly coveted achievement that requires consistent and intentional dedication to the overall employee experience,\" says Sarah Lewis-Kulin, the Vice President of Global Recognition at Great Place To Work.
