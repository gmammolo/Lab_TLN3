  "text": "Scheme to recruit more women in manufacturing\nA group of manufacturing firms have launched a scheme to encourage more female recruits, in a sector where only a quarter of the workforce are women.\nThe Advanced Manufacturing Forum (AMF), which represents more than 70 companies across the north-east of England, said outdated perceptions were putting off potential applicants.\nIt has set up a women in manufacturing and engineering group, which will work with colleges and universities to encourage more female recruits and support mentoring for women already in the industry.\nGateshead engineer Amy Gilmore, 23, who backs the drive, said: \"I think people see it as a men's world - that's completely not true, it's for everyone.\"\nA 2024 report says despite women making up approximately half of the UK's working population, they represent only 26.1% of the manufacturing workforce.\nAMF director Rachel Skeoch said: \"The biggest misconception is probably that it is incredibly dirty or old-fashioned.\n\"But that couldn't be further from the truth.\"\nInclusive workforce\nMrs Skeoch said increasing the number of women working in the sector would boost talent and economic growth.\n\"They approach things very differently, they have an incredible skill set,\" she said.\n\"And it's just so incredibly important that they are represented in one of the UK's most vital sectors.\"\nElectric motor and battery-maker Turntide sponsored Ms Gilmore through university.\n\"I have a really lovely team and I love the work,\" she said.\nTurntide's senior director of operations Paul Turbitt said the company was aiming to attract more women, having \"seen the benefits\" of a more inclusive workforce.\nThe firm has also introduced more flexible working arrangements.\n\"There's more part-time, the flexible hybrid, remote working,\" Mr Turbitt said.",
