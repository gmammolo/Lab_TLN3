  "text": "A Kentucky mechanical maintenance company will soon begin work on a new $7 million plant in Heflin, with plans to hire up to 30 people.\nContour Fabrications and Mechanical (CFM) has announced that construction and site work along U.S. 78 is set to begin next month, with an opening in early 2026.\nCFM will refurbish and maintain the large steel reels used in neighboring client Southwire’s manufacturing plant in Heflin, where that company produces high- and medium voltage electrical cables.\nThe new location will serve Southwire at both its West Georgia and Heflin locations. The company also looked at sites in Georgia before deciding on Heflin.\n“Alabama’s rural communities are playing a vital role in driving our state’s economic future, and CFM’s decision to locate in Cleburne County is proof of that progress,” Gov. Kay Ivey said in a statement.\nThe project is benefiting from $2 million pledged by the Growing Alabama program toward site preparation and infrastructure development. Growing Alabama authorizes up to $26 million in funding for economic development.\n“This new location shows our commitment to quality and growth,” Jason Young, co-owner of CFM, said. “We look forward to serving Southwire and building connections in Alabama.”\nAlabama Commerce Secretary Ellen McNair said the project is the “kind of impactful, targeted growth” the state supports through its Catalyst strategy.\nCatalyst, approved last year, identifies eight sectors for economic development, with one being metals and advanced materials.\n“This project not only strengthens Alabama’s industrial base but also brings high-quality jobs to a rural community that is clearly ready for growth,” McNair said.",
