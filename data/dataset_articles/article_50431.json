  "text": "„Cape „Chervenka“ in the municipality of Sozopol is among the largest properties that the Council of Ministers included in the list of state-owned land with no longer needed. Here we see another example of how the state has not done its job in preparing this list of over 4,400 properties.“\nThis was stated by the co-chairman of „Yes, Bulgaria“ Bozhidar Bozhanov, who visited Cape Chervenka today, the party's press center reported. The MP revealed that there are many restitution claims and pending cases regarding Cape Chervenka that have not been completed. Bozhidar Bozhanov added that archaeological excavations are being carried out on the property. There is also a fortress there, which could turn out to be a tourist attraction.\n„This entire analysis should have been done by the relevant ministry, which intends to dispose of this property. This work has not been done. This property was uploaded, then taken down from the MRDPW website, and the local people think: „Here, now it will be sold.“ Not that the Council of Ministers necessarily said this, but because of their poor communication and the incomplete analysis, there are more questions than answers,” said Bozhanov.\nAccording to the co-chairman of „Yes, Bulgaria“, in principle, initiatives to sell state-owned properties that are truly no longer necessary are positive. The party will insist on an adequate analysis of the need and potential solutions for the specific properties. “If necessary, the fortress should be separated from the rest, the parts that are subject to restitution claims should be separated and then proceed to subsequent actions,“ added Bozhidar Bozhanov.",
