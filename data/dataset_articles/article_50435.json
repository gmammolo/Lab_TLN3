  "text": "Duron Ontario Highlights Importance of Skilled Trades and Fair Wages in Construction\nIndustry leader featured in exclusive Q&A urges greater support for skilled labour, union protection, and innovation in infrastructure work\nMISSISSAUGA, ON / ACCESS Newswire / August 8, 2025 / Duron Ontario Ltd., a trusted name in Canada's construction sector since 1959, is using its recent feature interview to shine a light on an urgent issue facing the industry: the need to value skilled trades and support fair, sustainable jobs for workers across Canada.\nIn their newly released Q&A article \"Inside Duron Ontario: A Conversation on Craftsmanship, Innovation and Legacy,\" the company reflects on its six-decade journey while sounding the alarm on declining skilled labour interest and rising pressure on construction professionals.\n\"We believe in fair pay and dignity at work,\" a Duron Ontario spokesperson said. \"Our team is unionized and skilled. That's not just a business choice-it's a social responsibility.\"\nAs one of Canada's few Certified Living Wage Employers in the construction industry, Duron Ontario is urging more companies, clients, and policymakers to recognize the long-term benefits of respecting trade workers. Their unionized workforce ensures excellent safety, and industry-leading standards - benefits that ripple across infrastructure, housing, and economic growth.\nThe Numbers Tell the Story\nAccording to BuildForce Canada, 257,000 construction workers will retire by 2032, with fewer young Canadians entering the trades to replace them. Simultaneously, housing and infrastructure demands are rising across Ontario and the country.\n\"You can't cut corners,\" Duron Ontario shared in the interview. \"That's been our rule since day one. And it only works when your team is stable, skilled and respected.\"\nDuron Ontario also warns that the push for cheaper, faster construction can backfire - leading to costly rework, safety risks, and long-term decay. The company's emphasis on craftsmanship, innovation, and accountability shows a different path.\n\"We don't just build structures,\" they added. \"We help build communities.\"\nWhat People Can Do\nWhile the company continues advocating within the industry, it believes the public also plays a role. Duron Ontario encourages individuals, business owners, and leaders to:\nValue skilled trades as essential, respected careers\nHire companies with living wage and union commitments\nAsk questions about project standards, worker rights and long-term quality\nEncourage youth to explore construction as a rewarding, stable path\n\"The next generation needs to see that this is not just hard labour-it's meaningful, professional work,\" they said.\nTo read the full interview, visit the website here .\nAbout Duron Ontario Ltd.\nFounded in 1959, Duron Ontario Ltd. specialises in flooring, waterproofing, roofing, and restoration, with a portfolio that includes the Scotiabank Arena (Toronto Maple Leafs), Royal Ontario Museum, and national clients such as General Motors, Canadian Tire, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The company is known for technical precision, product innovation, and a commitment to safe, fair workplaces.\nContact:\nWebsite: duron.ca\nEmail: [email protected]\nSOURCE: Duron Ontario\nView the original press release on ACCESS Newswire\nNews published on 8 august 2025 at 14:45 and distributed by:",
