  "text": "Residents and fellow physicians at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore have voted to ratify their first labor contract with the hospital.\nThe deal covers nearly 1,000 residents and fellows, who are represented by the University of Maryland Resident and Fellow Alliance, an affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers—Maryland AFL-CIO.\nAccording to a union news release, the deal includes a 20% salary increase over three years, four weeks of paid vacation, reimbursement for rides home after long shifts and “higher standards for the work rooms and call rooms residents and fellows use.” It also establishes a labor-management committee, among other provisions.\n“This is a historic achievement that reflects the strength, solidarity and perseverance of our resident and fellow physicians. … From day 1, we have been fighting for a contract that allows us to stay focused on our patients and not on things like how we’ll afford to live in the city we work in, protect our rights as trainees, get home after a long shift or manage mounting student loan debt,” Lo Tamburro, MD, UMRFA bargaining chair, said in the release.\n“We are pleased that following nearly nine months of good faith negotiations, we reached a collective bargaining agreement with the University of Maryland Resident and Fellow Alliance union,” a hospital spokesperson said in a statement shared with Becker’s. “Throughout this process we have remained focused on providing high-quality and compassionate care for our patients and communities, and we appreciate the passion and innovation our residents and fellows provide to make this possible.”\nResidents and fellow physicians at the University of Maryland Medical Center voted to unionize in June 2024.",
