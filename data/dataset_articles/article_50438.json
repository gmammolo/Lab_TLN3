  "text": "Major redevelopment of a historic Tasmanian hydro power scheme is back on the table, and it could create 250 jobs during construction.\nHydro Tasmania is yet to make a final investment decision on whether to go ahead with a revamped version of the Tarraleah project, which it estimated would cost $1.96 billion in 2024 dollars.\nThe decision is expected in late 2026.\nHydro said the project would only proceed if there was a strong commercial case and it would benefit Tasmania.\nThe project might also need assessment and approval from the federal Environment Department under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.\nProject documents have been lodged with the department and are available for public comment until August 14.\nThe department will decide whether it is a controlled action under the act.\nThat would require it to be assessed.\nThe Tarraleah power scheme in the Central Highlands was commissioned in 1938.\nHydro said it generated 7.3 per cent of Tasmania's energy needs on average, but was reaching the end of its operational life.\nIt said a failure of the canals and pipelines could affect the nearby world heritage area.\nMeanwhile, the age of the assets led to frequent outages and high maintenance costs.\n\"There is no do-nothing option,\" Hydro said.\nIt told the department ageing assets would still need to be replaced if the project did not proceed.\nHydro said the redevelopment would double Tarraleah's generating capacity, create up to 250 jobs during construction and lead to significant local investment.\nThe new material lodged with the department follows a departmental recommendation that the previous referral be withdrawn and a new one submitted.\n\"Since our referral, we've undertaken extensive geotechnical and engineering work and the potential project footprint has increased,\" Hydro said.\nIt said the department could consider the works based on the latest information.\n\"Sitting at the top of the Derwent hydropower scheme, Tarraleah is one of our oldest and most recognisable assets, with a network of canals and six enormous penstocks that transport water 290 metres down to Tarraleah Station in the Nive Valley,\" Hydro said.\n\"Tarraleah's labyrinth of tunnels, canals and pipes were an engineering triumph that have supplied Tasmanians with dependable energy for more than 80 years.\n\"In today's electricity market, the demand for clean energy from wind and solar is rising and so is the need for a way to fill the gaps when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.\n\"We're looking at how we can adapt our assets, including Tarraleah, to make sure they're ready to meet these new needs.\"\nHydro said the Tarraleah project would include a new power station, replacing the canals and penstocks with a new pipeline for water, upgrading transmission infrastructure and preserving the historic station.\nIt said the new station would generate 30 per cent more electricity from the same amount of water.\nHydro expected it would also bring in more revenue, with bigger profits to support schools, hospitals and housing.\nAs well as needing government approvals, Hydro expects to seek approval from the state Parliament.\nThe business case said Hydro was negotiating concessional financing with the $19 billion federal Clean Energy Finance Corporation.\nIt is also eyeing an increase in its corporate loan facilities and \"internally generated cashflows\".\nTributes & Funerals Notices\nMore Tributes & Funerals Notices",
