  "text": "Pune: The labour department has begun mapping gig workers to create a centralised database in a key step towards extending legal protection and welfare benefits to them. State labour minister Aakash Fundkar told TOI on Friday that the comprehensive policy, expected to be announced by the year-end, would cover platform-based workers across companies and offer benefits such as health and accident insurance, pension schemes, skill development, and emergency financial aid. \"There are 321 registered e-commerce establishments in the state. A robust database is essential to ensure effective delivery of benefits and safeguard workers' rights,\" Fundkar said. A review meeting was held in Mumbai on Thursday. The meeting saw representations from Pune and Mumbai, including workers' groups and platform companies. Fundkar stressed the govt's commitment to bringing gig workers under the ambit of labour laws and relevant social security codes. \"States like Rajasthan, Karnataka, and Telangana are already moving in this direction. We, too, are working along similar lines and should be able to finalise the policy soon,\" he said. So far, two to three meetings have been held, but more consultations are planned, with wider stakeholder participation, including workers' collectives and platform operators. \"This is a crucial step in bringing gig workers on a par with the organised sector. They must not remain outside the scope of govt labour protections,\" the minister added. Workers have voiced concerns over job insecurity, absence of benefits, and erratic income. \"Once we lose our jobs, there is no safety net. Many of us work two to three shifts a day just to make ends meet,\" said a gig worker representative. Fundkar said the state is exploring ways to integrate gig workers into existing labour laws or create specific provisions tailored to their needs.\nStay updated with the latest local news from your city on Times of India (TOI).
