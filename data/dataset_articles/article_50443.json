  "text": "Cheetham Hill Construction (CHC) transitioned to an employee ownership trust (EOT) on 1st August 2025, with 100% of the shares owned by the 100 or so employees.\nThe transition fulfils the long-standing ambition of founder and managing director Howard Chamberlain, who has led the company for the past 59 years.\nHoward Chamberlain set up the business as a limited company in 1966 when he was just 20 years old. In 2016 ownership passed to his daughters, Claire Chamberlain and Katie Myers, who are both directors of CHC alongside their father.\nHoward Chamberlain will remain a director under the new ownership model although Mike Goodier, previously contracts director, has now taken over as managing director.\nCHC is expecting to hit £25m turnover for this year, which is an increase of more than 30% on the previous filed accounts, as delayed projects and frameworks are now in full flow, the company said.\nGot a story?
