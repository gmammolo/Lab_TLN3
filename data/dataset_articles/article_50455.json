  "text": "United Auto Workers Local 14 has reached a new collective bargaining agreement with General Motors that includes a $200 million investment into the Toledo factory. Tony Totty, the president of Local 14, said the union and company finalized the agreement in the past month. It will expire with the national agreement on May 1, 2028. Among the accomplishments, Mr. Totty promoted a $200 million investment that will increase transmission capacity at the factory. “It means we can alleviate some of the heavy overtime that we have by spreading the work and having new equipment create more components so the line can run smoother,” the union president said. Mr. Totty said union members will also be able to split their five personal days, using them as vacation days. Now members will have 10 days in addition to the other vacation time they already receive. The union president said the agreement is a “weight off our shoulders” and credited Jeff King, the shop chairman on the bargaining team. It was Mr. King’s fourth local agreement, and he was at the national bargaining table for the 2019-2023 agreement as well. The union has been bargaining since the previous agreement’s expiration in 2023. “You know, we had our demands, and we weren’t going to settle for a contract that our members didn’t think was a good one, so it took a long time to negotiate,” Mr. Totty said. Although it took about two years, Mr. Totty said many other local unions don’t have a local agreement yet, adding that it speaks volumes of Local 14’s “great membership.” “They wouldn’t want to invest into a bad work force, which we are not,” Mr. Totty said. “We’re a very good work force, and they see the value in putting more dollars into Toledo, and that’s good for our whole community.” Subscribe to The Blade",
