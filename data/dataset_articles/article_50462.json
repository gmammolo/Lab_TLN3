  "text": "Business\nAfrica’s largest shea butter refinery opens in Niger State\nIn a bid to meet the rising global demand for shea butter, Salid Agriculture Nigeria Limited has launched a 30,000-metric-tonne annual processing facility in Kudu, Mokwa Local Government Area of Niger State to boost Nigeria’s economy.\nThe state governor, Mohammed Umaru Bago, who performed the inauguration in Mokwa, described the project as a major step in positioning Niger as the global hub for shea production.\nBago emphasised that the plant marks a new era for Niger State, where natural resources are harnessed to create jobs and drive economic prosperity.\nAccording to him, “The state government has allocated 10,000 hectares for shea butter tree cultivation to ensure a consistent raw material supply, making Niger State an attractive and secure environment for investors.\n“We have entered a N2 billion Memorandum of Understanding, MoU, between Niger Foods and the company to provide direct employment opportunities for women and youth in shea nut harvesting and supply.”\nAccording to Ali Saidu, CEO of Salid Agriculture, the facility, which is the largest in Africa, plans to scale up its processing capacity to 400 metric tonnes per day and establish a cutting-edge shea butter refinery.\nHe explained that the company’s vision is to secure sustainable raw material sources, preserve biodiversity, and empower local communities through long-term land stewardship.\n“The company is working in partnership with GIZ and DFID through the PROPCOM MAIKAIFI project to organise local shea nut pickers, mainly women, into structured cooperatives, promoting grassroots employment,” Saidu disclosed.\nDaniel Alabi, Executive Director of Salid Agriculture, described the facility as a symbol of perseverance and commitment, while outlining the company’s corporate social responsibility projects, including rural electrification, girl-child education, and environmental protection.\nSimilarly, Abba Bello, CEO of NEXIM Bank, which sponsored the project, observed that Nigeria accounts for 60 per cent of global shea nut production but lacked large-scale industrial processing facilities until now, just as he announced plans for setting up four additional processing plants across the country.\nFurthermore, the Etsu Nupe and Chairman of the Niger State Council of Traditional Rulers, Alhaji Yahaya Abubakar, commended Governor Bago’s agricultural vision but cautioned against indiscriminate tree felling.",
