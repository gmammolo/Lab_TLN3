  "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) — America’s manufacturing workforce is aging, and experts warn that without an influx of young talent, over two million skilled jobs could go unfilled in the next decade. The University of Tennessee is hoping to change that through its weeklong METAL Bootcamp, short for Metallurgical Engineering Trades Apprenticeships and Learning. This hands-on program teaches participants how to work with metal, skills leaders say are critical to national security. According to workforce coordinator Greg Harrell with The Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation, this need is urgent. “We desperately need to fill those workforce areas and get people some experience so they can get straight into industrial work,” Harrel said. The bootcamp draws students, recent graduates, early career professionals, even entire families who want to learn together. William Craddock attended alongside his wife and daughter. “It’s been a good experience,” Craddock said, “She finds stuff. ‘Let’s go volunteer for this. Let’s go do that,’ and we jump on board.” Assistant professor Dustin Gilmer, who teaches in UT’s Department of Material Science and Engineering, said the program is preparing the next generation to step into positions that are opening fast. “What we need are people to backfill those positions, and to do it immediately,” Gilmer said. “We want those people to impart the knowledge of decades onto the ones coming into the workforce.” The METAL Bootcamp is funded in part by the U.S. Department of Defense and coordinated by IACMI, which is headquartered in Knoxville. Organizers hope the program will continue to inspire more young people to pursue careers in manufacturing — before the current workforce hangs up its gloves for good.
