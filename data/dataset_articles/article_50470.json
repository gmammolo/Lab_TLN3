  "text": "Workers at Quality Pork Processors (QPP) in Austin, Minn. , have ratified a new, three-year contract that secures \"historic wage increases and a ratification bonus,\" the UFCW Local 663 announced this week. The contract gives workers a 15.6% raise, which is the largest wage increase given at QPP, according to the union. That includes a $2.20 per hour raise in the first year and a $3.10 per hour increase over the three-year term of the contract. Additionally, workers received a $200 ratification bonus, as well as improved vision and dental benefits. “I’ll be celebrating this contract with my coworkers,\" Josh Nelson, a worker in the cut department at QPP, said in a statement. \"Having the negotiations room packed with members won us more money than we ever have before.\" QPP did not respond to a request for comment on the ratification. \"The workers at QPP stood together to demand a contract that values their hard work with fair wages and dignity,” said UFCW 663 President Rena Wong. \"In Austin, a proud union town, workers made it clear: fair pay isn’t optional, it’s necessary.\"",
