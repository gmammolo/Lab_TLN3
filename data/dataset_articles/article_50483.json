  "text": "More than 200 employees at Dajcor Aluminum in Chatham, Ont., are back on the job after voting overwhelmingly in favour of a new contract.\nUnifor Local 127 President Jeff McFadden says members ratified a four year deal on Wednesday with 87.5 per cent support, ending an eight day strike.\n\"I couldn't be more proud of that membership,\" said McFadden about the employees at Dajcor Aluminum, which makes aluminum products for the automotive, medical and office space sectors.\nClusters of aluminum cylinders are piled at Dajcor Aluminum. (Dajcor Aluminum ) The deal was reached Thursday night. McFadden says members returned to work on the midnight shift following the vote.\nWorkers walked off the job more than a week ago after the union said it learned the company was planning to remove equipment from the factory and bring in \"scab labour.\"\nAccording to its website, since 2010, Dajcor's large Chatham factory has supplied Canadian and U.S. clients with extruded, fabricated, and anodized aluminum components.\nThe company also has a U.S. facility in Kentucky.\nMcFadden said members were in a position to strike immediately after their collective agreement ended on July 27.\nMcFadden says members are very happy with the new agreement, which includes a wage increase of more than 20 per cent over four years, improved benefits and a substantial signing bonus.\n\"They were very respectful on the picket line,\" he said. \"Spirits were high at the end. They stood strong for what they thought they needed and what they got.\"\nThe company did not respond to a request for comment Friday.",
