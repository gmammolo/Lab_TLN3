  "text": "JANESVILLE — Fair Share America brought its “Stop the Billionaire Giveaways” national bus tour to Janesville Friday to rally with the United Auto Workers Local 95 healthcare workers. The workers have been on strike from the Mercyhealth East clinic to receive what they say would be fairer wages and safer working conditions. “Safety isn’t a luxury, it isn’t a bargaining chip. It isn’t a maybe. It’s a necessity. It is the foundation of good care. This company has shown that they have enough money…to give you a fair agreement. You can look at these bloated salaries…of the CEO, of the executives here. It’s a runaway train and it’s absolutely disgusting,” said Andrew Stark, UAW Region 4 servicing representative and the workers’ lead negotiator. “We are being told by Mercy Health that they cannot afford security, yet they can afford to pay themselves millions of dollars.” The 45-foot tour bus was wrapped in a giant “trillion-dollar bill” with a message saying “a fair share for Americans,” pulled up to a picket line of at least 100 workers,” Fair Share America said in a statement. “What you’re doing for your patients and for the broader Janesville community should be celebrated,” said Fair Share America Executive Director Kristen Crowell, who spoke to the picket line alongside the union workers. “The CEOs are stealing from us. Government is taking our tax dollars to give away to rich people. It’s all a scam. And unless we stand up and we say ‘no’ and we organize something radically different in this country, we’re going back to the status quo.” In July, Mercyhealth Vice President of Operations Jenni Hallat told The Gazette that her organization has treated its 137 partners at Mercyhealth East “fairly,” which has been consistent with its other 8,000-plus employees and partners. UAW 95 has since opened a food pantry and a strike fund for the workers.",
