  "text": "MILFORD — City Council members, in a 5-2 vote, Aug. 6 approved a new city pay scale that increased by one notch the pay grades of five high-ranking police officers. Police Chief Cecilia Ashe’s pay grade will rise from 13 to 14, one level below that of the city manager. The pay grade of the department’s captain, who serves as deputy police chief, will go from 12 to 13, identical to that of the finance, electric and public works directors. The pay grades of the police department’s three lieutenants will rise from 11 to 12, the same as that of the planning, human resources and information technology directors. Vice Mayor Jason James Sr. and council members Michael Stewart, Katrina Wilson, Danny Perez and Lori Connor voted in favor of the pay-scale changes, while council members Daniel Marabello and Nadia Zychal voted nay. Member D. Madula Kalesis was absent. Milford resident Kathryn Stetson also opposed the pay changes in an email to the city. “These increases are out of the pay range for comparable cities and should receive further review and analysis,” Ms. Stetson wrote. “Under this proposal, the lowest-paid lieutenant’s salary will be higher than all but two Milford department heads. This is not equitable or financially responsible.” Ms. Stetson urged council members to reject the pay proposal and commission a neutral third party to conduct another salary survey to ensure those officers’ salaries were compatible with ones paid in other comparable Delaware localities.",
