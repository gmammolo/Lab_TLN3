  "text": "Novato’s largest group of unionized municipal employees returned to work on Friday following a three-day strike.\nIn a statement, city administrators said Service Employees International Union Local 1021, which represents the 76 employees, informed the city late Thursday evening that the strike was over.\n“We felt it was a huge success,” said Jana Blunt, a field representative with SEIU Local 1021. “The membership was really enthusiastic and organized.”\nBlunt said the union saw no reason to extend the strike into a fourth day because many employees don’t work for the city on Fridays due to alternative scheduling.\nDespite the strike’s end, the administration’s statement said parks and recreation camps and programs already canceled will not resume. Gymnastics classes were closed through Saturday, and several other camps will remain closed through their final week of Aug. 11 to 15.\nSome parents learned of the strike when they tried to drop their children off for camp on Tuesday morning and were informed it had been canceled.\n“City staff have reached out directly to impacted parents and participants to provide refunds for classes and programs as well as make alternative camp programming available through the local YMCA,” the administration statement said.\nThe two sides returned to the bargaining table on Thursday afternoon and are scheduled to meet again on Wednesday.\nThe union group includes street maintenance workers, building inspectors, parks and recreation coordinators and city planners. The group’s two-year contract expired on June 30, but negotiations started in February.\nThe union and the city are at an impasse over equity increases in pay for represented employees. According to the administration, the workers have been offered 11% raises over three years, with some receiving up to 24% through equity adjustments.\nBlunt said the union’s members rejected the city’s last offer because it would have left them still earning 93.5% of what employees at comparable municipalities earn.\nUnion members complained during the strike that they helped to pass the Measure M sales tax initiative to generate more revenue for the city and that now city officials were refusing to use that money to provide them with more equitable wages.\nMeasure M, which was passed by Novato voters in November by a 57.9% majority, increased the local sales tax from 8.5% to 9.25%. The measure included no expiration date.\nIn their statement announcing the end of the strike, city administrators wrote: “Thanks to community support of Measure M, the city is advancing key workforce and financial investments following years of staffing challenges — including funding for six new full-time positions with two additional SEIU-represented maintenance workers to support core maintenance priorities, strengthening financial reserves, addressing deferred maintenance and infrastructure, planning for long-term pension liabilities and investing in innovation to improve operational efficiency.”\nMeasure M is expected to generate about $10 million annually in revenue. The city has budgeted this year $1.2 million to restore staffing and resources; $1.3 million to the emergency disaster and recovery reserve; $1.9 million to capital improvements; $1 million to the city’s pension reserve; $500,000 to deferred maintenance; and $250,000 to innovation and investment.\nThe city’s contracts with the Novato Police Association and the Novato Police Managers’ Association also expired in June. Those negotiations are ongoing.\nLast month, the city approved a labor agreement for the Novato Civilian Employees Association — which includes dispatchers and community service officers — along with compensation plans for three unrepresented employee groups: engineers, confidential and exempt management. Those approved agreements provide 11% salary increases over three years and up to 13% equity adjustments for some employees.",
