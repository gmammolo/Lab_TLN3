  "text": "In the context of international integration, businesses are increasingly focusing on sustainable development and social responsibility, collective labor agreements (CLAs) have been playing an important role in building credibility with partners and winning trust of employees. At the same time, they serve as a bridge to build harmonious, stable, and progressive labor relations in the workplace.\nWhen policies on salary and welfare are guaranteed, employees will feel secure in their work. In the photo: Workers of Tokin Electronics Vietnam Co., Ltd. (Long Binh Ward) during working hours. Photo: Thao My |\nCollective labor agreements are not only legal tools but also bring double benefits in connecting the interests of employees and employers, aiming for sustainable production and stable employment.\nCreating stable labor relations\nAccording to the assessment of the Provincial Labor Federation, from the beginning of 2025 until now, labor relations in Dong Nai have been harmonious and stable. Workers feel secure in production, improve their skills, product quality, and actively participate in emulation movements at businesses. Contributing to such result is the good implementation of policies by businesses and the close touch of grassroots trade unions. Businesses proactively engage in dialogue, improve welfare, working environment, and increase income so that employees are committed and dedicated.\nRecent surveys by the Provincial Labor Federation on the operations of trade unions and labor and employment in businesses show that most of businesses are operating stably thanks to the good implementation of policies as committed in collective labor agreements.\nA typical example is Dong Phuong Co., Ltd. (in Binh Minh Commune), a business with over 9,000 employees (nearly 70% of them are female), where labor relations are very united and stable. The business owner is concerned with creating all conditions for the trade union to operate effectively, implementing many models in caring for the material and spiritual lives of employees.\nAs for the collective labor agreement signed by Dong Phuong Co., Ltd. with the grassroots trade union, benefits have been increased beyond what is stipulated by law. Specifically, for pregnant female workers, the company is not allowed to arrange them to operate cutting machines or come into contact with chemicals that affect reproductive function and childcare. Cases of paid leave as regulated, such as marriage, female workers taking regular prenatal check-ups, and husbands taking leave for their wives' childbirth, are not subject to production bonus deductions. The company provides a breast milk expression and storage room and arranges a separate parking area for pregnant female workers.\nAccording to Le Tran Khanh Son, Chairman of the grassroots Trade Union of Dong Phuong Co., Ltd., in addition to organizing dialogues and listening to the workers’ thoughts through conferences, the collective labour agreements serve as an important key to harmonizing the interests of employees and businesses. Not only do they protect employee rights, but the collective labour agreements also help businesses stabilize production, enhance competitiveness, and build a responsible brand. The effective development, signing, and implementation of collective labour agreements are proof of harmonious, progressive development and the building of a committed and dedicated workforce.\nIn reality, in businesses with quality collective labour agreements, the relationship between the business owner and employees is always stable.\nDang Thi Hoang Lan, Chairwoman of the Trade Union of Wacoal Vietnam Co., Ltd. (Amata Industrial Park, Long Binh Ward), said: Since the collective labour agreement was signed and supplemented, employees in the company have enjoyed many additional benefits regarding salary, bonuses, rest time, increased lunch meal value, position bonuses, and annual vacation trips for employees, etc.\n\"When employees' rights are guaranteed, they will have a positive working attitude and feel secure in long-term commitment to the business. Thus, it helps businesses improve productivity and product quality, reduce recruitment and retraining costs, and improve the business's reputation and image in the labor market,\" Dang Thi Hoang Lan shared.\nHelping businesses maintain stable production\nThe collective labour agreements are negotiated and signed between the grassroots Trade Union executive committee and the employer, reflecting consensus on working conditions such as: wages, working hours, rest regulations, welfare, occupational safety and health, living support, etc. In particular, a signed collective labour agreement brings \"dual\" benefits to both employees and businesses. For employees, it helps ensure better rights than those stipulated by law. For businesses, it enhances reputation and improves production and business efficiency.\nThe collective labour agreements are testaments to a sustainable working environment, contributing to increasing the international cooperation capabilities of businesses. In addition, it increases stability, transparency, and creates safe working conditions for employees. When businesses effectively implement the regulations and policies as committed, it will reduce the risk of labor disputes, create more credibility for businesses in the international market, and build trust among employees.\nThe Provincial Labor Federation stated: In the first 6 months of 2025, grassroots trade unions participated in negotiating and signing 35 new collective labour agreements, achieving nearly 44% of the target assigned by the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor. In addition, 218 agreements were re-signed, amended, and supplemented, bringing the total number of collective labour agreements in the province to 1,384 out of 1,689 grassroots trade unions eligible under the law to be negotiated and signed by trade unions. Thanks to this, employees are not only legally protected but also have improved living and working conditions, reducing worries about income and social security.\nVu Hoang Mong Cuong, Chairman of the Trade Union of Shingmark Vina Co., Ltd. (in An Vien commune), said: The entire company currently has nearly 4,000 employees. In 2023, the grassroots trade union was selected by the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor as a pilot for dialogue with businesses on representing, caring for, and protecting the rights and interests of female workers at the workplace. After the dialogue, the business agreed to sign 5 contents beneficial to employees, such as: providing periodic gynecological examination once a year; improving lunch meals from 18,000 VND to 25,000 VND/meal for pregnant female workers and those with children under 12-month old; increasing childcare support from 50,000 VND to 80,000 VND.\nIn addition, the business supports 1 million VND/person for female workers giving birth and arranges a separate parking area for pregnant employees.\n\"Whether the signed agreement has many or few benefits depends on the skill and ingenuity of the Trade Union officials in negotiating with the business owner. If the Trade Union knows how to choose the right time to negotiate and propose long-term benefits, the business will certainly agree, and employees will enjoy many better policies,\" Vu Hoang Mong Cuong shared.\nBy Thao My/Translated by Van Nga - Thu Ha",
