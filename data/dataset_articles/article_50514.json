  "text": "Aviation unions under the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency have called off their planned strike following what they described as positive developments in ongoing negotiations for improved remuneration.\nPUNCH Online reported on Wednesday that the coalition of unions directed all staff of NAMA to halt services indefinitely starting on Monday, August 11, due to unresolved issues in their demands for better pay.\nHowever, in a new directive, the coalition said it deferred the strike because of recent developments, including the release of a “no objection” letter from the Budget Office to the National Incomes, Salaries and Wages Commission, and assurances from NAMA’s management to expedite the payment of new remuneration alongside August salaries.\nThe decision was announced in a joint statement issued on Friday by key union leaders, including the Secretary General of the Association of Nigeria Aviation Professionals, AbdulRasaq Saidu and Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Air Transport Employees, Odinaka Igbokwe.\nOther signatories to the notice include the Principal Deputy General Secretary of the Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, Frances Akinjole, and the General Secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Public Corporations, Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services Employees, Alo Lawrence.\n“Yesterday, we were compelled by unfavourable circumstances surrounding our quest for improved remunerations to reinforce our earlier notice of withdrawal of services to the effect of issuing clear directive to commence the action on Monday 11th August, 2025.\n“Now, however, due to the hard work of the management of NAMA and the intervention of the Honourable Minister of Aviation and other senior officials of the ministry, we are happy to report that there have been some positive developments around the issue.\n“In this respect, we note the release of the ‘no objection’ letter from the Budget Office to the National Incomes, Salaries and Wages Commission yesterday (7 August, 2025), and the letter from the management of NAMA to its staff to the effect of its strenuous efforts and expectations to ensure payment of the new remunerations along with August salaries.\n“Based on the above, and in order to demonstrate good faith, our unions have taken the decision to defer the strike action scheduled to commence on Monday 11th August, 2025, pending the state of affairs on the subject matter at the end of August, 2025,” the statement reads.\nThe unions enjoined all staff of NAMA to join them in keeping a hopeful watch as the situation unfolds.",
