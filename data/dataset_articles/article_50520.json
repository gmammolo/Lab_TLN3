  "text": "New industrial relations policy will protect workers’ rights, FG assures labour\nThe Federal Government has assured the organised labour of the benefits of the new National Industrial Relations Policy recently approved by the Federal Executive Council.\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Muhammad Dingyadi, gave the assurance while speaking with journalists on Friday in Abuja.\nMr Dingyadi was reacting to the rejection of the new policy by the organised labour.\nRecall that organised labour in a statement rejected the policy, considering it an attempt to criminalise strikes and silence the labour unions.\nAccording to the minister, the new policy will bring numerous benefits to Nigeria, such as improved industrial harmony, enhanced productivity, and protection of workers’ rights.\nHe said, “The policy is the culmination of several engagements of government, represented by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, organised labour, represented by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC), and employers, represented by the Nigeria Employers Consultative Association (NECA). These engagements spanned nearly seven years, and the final draft of the NIPR policy was validated by the stakeholders in December 2024. The benefits of the policy to Nigeria include improved industrial harmony by reducing industrial disputes and promoting stable labour relations nationwide, leading to more predictable, peaceful, and structured labour relations across sectors.’’\nMr Dingyadi said it would ensure smooth workplace operations and strengthen tripartite cooperation between the government, employers, and workers.\nHe added that the policy would boost productivity and strengthen investor confidence in Nigeria’s labour environment.\nHe also said the policy would align Nigeria’s industrial relations practices with global benchmarks, particularly those of the International Labour Organisation (ILO).\nAccording to him, it will make the country more competitive and attractive to domestic and foreign investments.\nMr Dingyadi further said the policy would lead to enhanced social dialogue, emphasising its importance in resolving conflicts and building consensus among stakeholders.\nHe added that this includes regular consultations and negotiations between the government, employers, and trade unions.\nHe said, “The NIRP ensures the protection of workers’ rights, including fair wages, safe working conditions, and the right to collective bargaining, while also addressing issues such as gender equality and non-discrimination. The policy would serve as a reference point for labour laws, union engagement, and conflict resolution in both public and private sectors, promoting more effective labour relations.”\n(NAN)\nWe have recently deactivated our website's comment provider in favour of other channels of distribution and commentary.
