  "text": "After ten weeks of walking the picket line, the 25 members of CUPE 5525 Villa Colombo Supportive Housing are finally returning to work. The workers had been on strike since May 28.\nThe union and the employer reached a tentative agreement on Friday, August 1, with the union members ratifying the vote with over a 94% margin. The agreement is the first in the local’s history and sets the baseline for their future negotiations.\nThe workers are returning to work on Friday, August 8.",
