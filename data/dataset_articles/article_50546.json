  "text": "Aviation unions have deferred their planned strike action, citing “positive developments” in ongoing talks over improved remuneration for workers.\nThe strike, which was scheduled to begin on Monday, August 11, was put on hold following the intervention of the Minister of Aviation and senior ministry officials, as well as efforts by the management of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA).\nIn a joint notice, the unions under NAMA said they had earlier been “compelled by unfavourable circumstances” to reinforce their strike notice but have now resolved to suspend the action pending further developments.\n“Now, however, due to the hard work of the Management of NAMA and the intervention of the Honourable Minister of Aviation and other senior officials of the Ministry, we are happy to report that there have been some positive developments around the issue,” the statement read.\nThe notice was signed by AbdulRasaq Saidu, Secretary General of the Association of Nigeria Aviation Professionals (ANAP); Odinaka Igbokwe, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE); Frances Akinjole, Principal Deputy General Secretary of the Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATSSSAN); and Alo Lawrence, General Secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Public Corporations, Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services Employees (AUPCTRE).\nThe unions highlighted the release of a “no objection” letter from the Budget Office to the National Incomes, Salaries and Wages Commission on August 7, and a follow-up letter from NAMA management to its staff outlining ongoing efforts to ensure payment of the new remuneration along with August salaries.\n“Based on the above, and in order to demonstrate good faith, our unions have taken the decision to defer the strike action scheduled to commence on Monday 11th August, 2025 pending the state of affairs on the subject matter at the end of August, 2025,” the statement added.",
