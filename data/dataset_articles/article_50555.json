  "title": "Malaysia introduces multiple-entry visa for Bangladeshi workers",
  "text": "Malaysia has introduced a multiple-entry visa (MEV) facility for Bangladeshi migrant workers, its Ministry of Home Affairs announced in a statement on Friday (8 August).\nUnder the new arrangement, Bangladeshi workers holding valid Temporary Work Visit Passes (PLKS) or single-entry visas will no longer need to apply separately for an MEV.\nInstead, the country’s Immigration Department will automatically issue the MEV at international entry points when workers renew their PLKS.\nThe ministry said the measure is aimed at simplifying travel procedures for migrant workers, preventing misuse of immigration passes, and strengthening border control systems.\nIt is also expected to ease the workload of Malaysian missions abroad by reducing the number of fresh visa applications.\nThe Bangladeshi government had long been requesting the MEV facility for its nationals working in Malaysia. The Bangladesh High Commission in Kuala Lumpur said the decision was the result of sustained diplomatic efforts.\nMalaysia currently recruits workers from 15 countries. Until now, only Bangladeshi workers were limited to single-entry visas, a system that often caused inconvenience.\nOfficials and workers expect the new MEV to allow greater flexibility in travel and improve mobility for Bangladeshis employed in the country.\nSMS/",
