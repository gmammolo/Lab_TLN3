  "text": "<p>Mumbai: In the blue collar category, Millennials and Gen Z continued to remain among the country's highest job-seeking population, accounting for 65 per cent of all job applications in 2024 as well as 2025, a report said on Saturday.</p>.<p>Among these, the surge in jobseeking has been most among the 20-23 years cohort, which saw a 50.7 per cent year-on-year increase in applications, according to a report by blue and grey-collar job platform WorkIndia.</p>.Job cuts, tariff uncertainties drag retail auto sales by 4.3% in July.<p>This youngest working-age group, largely comprising recent graduates, contributed to an 85.5 per cent rise in applications, reflecting a strong intent to enter the workforce early, it stated.</p>.<p>Even candidates with lower formal education levels (below 10th standard) showed a 37.4 per cent growth, indicating a widening base of job readiness and aspiration across educational backgrounds, the report added.</p>.<p>Millennials are those between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s and Gen Zs are those born from the mid-1990s to the early 2010s.</p>.<p>The report is based on data analysis of 111.71 million job seekers on the WorkIndia platform from January 2024 to July 2025.</p>.<p>The report further revealed that while both young men and women are actively applying for jobs early in their careers, gender dynamics reveal some divergence in the late-20s.</p>.<p>Women application rates in the 27-29 year age group have stagnated, while those of their male counterparts continued to rise, indicating the need for a closer look at career drop-offs or barriers for women in that age bracket.</p>.<p>It also found the growing willingness to travel for jobs, reflecting increased flexibility among the youth.</p>.<p>Applications for 'labourer' roles surged by 98 per cent, with a surge of 136 per cent increase among 20-23-year-olds.</p>.<p>Other fast-growing job categories include typist and data entry roles (67 per cent) and law-related positions (61 per cent), followed by steady interest in sales, HR, and manufacturing roles, said the report.</p>.<p>Meanwhile the report found that job applications from tier-IV cities jumped 54.9 per cent, suggesting that local economies are beginning to thrive and that candidates are increasingly seeking viable careers closer to home.</p>.<p>\"From tier I cities to tier IV towns, we're witnessing a workforce that is bold, mobile, and hungry for growth.
