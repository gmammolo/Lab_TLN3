  "text": "BEAUMONT, Texas — Baristas at the Starbucks location on Dowlen Road and Folsom voted Thursday to join Starbucks Workers United by a margin of 14-3, making it the 30th unionized store in Texas and fourth near the Houston area.\nThe victory adds to a nationwide organizing movement involving more than 12,000 baristas across over 600 locations in 45 states and the District of Columbia, according to a press release.\nBaristas seek workplace protections including living wages, respect, racial and gender equity, fair scheduling and staffing.\n\"I'm really excited to join Workers United and be part of something bigger than myself. It feels good to know we're all working together for fairness and respect. I'm excited to stand with my partners and make a difference for us all,\" said Kaylie Williams, a shift supervisor of three years.\nThe unionization effort continues a surge of organizing wins since Starbucks and Workers United announced a new path forward in February 2024.\nHowever, tensions have escalated as Workers United filed over 100 unfair labor practice charges in recent months, alleging Starbucks backtracked on agreements regarding organizing and collective bargaining.\nThe labor dispute has led to strikes and community support actions called \"sip-ins\" at locations nationwide.\nMore than 2,000 baristas at over 150 stores, including the SoDo Reserve location near Seattle headquarters, participated in recent actions demanding the company bargain over policy changes and finalize contracts.\nHundreds of Starbucks baristas continue voting to join unions monthly as the organizing campaign expands across the country.",
