  "text": "(Photo by BLOOMBERG) LICENSED social media platforms recorded a 96% compliance rate with government-issued takedown orders since the Online Safety Act 2025 came into force on Jan 1, according to Communications Minister Datuk Fahmi Fadzil.\n“Under Act 866, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), among others, is empowered to issue written directions to licensed service providers to remove online content deemed harmful as defined under the act.\n“Failure to comply with such written directions constitutes an offence punishable by a fine of up to RM1 million.\n“A further daily fine of up to RM100,000 may also be imposed for each day (or part thereof) that the offence continues after conviction,” he said in a written parliamentary reply last night.\nAs of Jan 27, 2026, Putrajaya issued a total of 25 takedown requests to service providers for various offences under the Act. Of these, he said 24 pieces of content, or 96% “were removed”.\nHowever, Fahmi did not specify the type of content for which takedown orders were issued, an English daily reported.\nHe added that for offences involving non-compliance with obligations under Part III of the Act 866, may result in financial penalties of up to RM10 million, including for failures to reduce exposure to harmful content, protect child users and render priority harmful content inaccessible.\nFahmi was responding to a question from Datuk Dr Richard Rapu @ Aman Begri (GRS–Betong).\nThe post Fahmi: 96% compliance with Online Safety Act takedown orders appeared first on The Malaysian Reserve.",
