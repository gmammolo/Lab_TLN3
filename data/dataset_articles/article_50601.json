  "text": "ALBANY – New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA) nurses at Albany Medical Center officially ratified a new four-year contract with 98% voting yes to ratify. Voting took place Aug. 4 and 5 and ended on Tuesday evening at 8 p.m. The contract will benefit approximately 1,600 nurses at the hospital, as well as incoming nurses that will fill vacancies.\nAs previously reported, the deal includes enforceable safe staffing standards updated annually that will protect safe patient care and wage increases to help retain experienced nurses, including 16% to 22% first-year wage increase upon ratification, market parity increases in two more years of the contract, additional 3% annual increases in the following years, and no wage caps for experienced nurses.\nThe new contract also includes new hiring and retention incentives, including a $2,000 referral bonus and increases to continuing education and tuition reimbursement benefits, and improved union voice and protections, including membership rights and an improved new hire orientation process.\nJennifer Bejo, RN, and local union president at Albany Med said, “This is a new day for nurses at Albany Medical Center. Union nurses showed what we can accomplish on behalf of our patients and colleagues when we work together and advocate. I am so proud of what we have achieved and feel hopeful that our new contract will help recruit and retain more nurses to improve staffing and patient care at Albany Med.”\n“Our goal has always been a new contract that is best for our nurses and advances our ability to provide safe, quality patient care,” said Albany Med Health System President and CEO Dennis P. McKenna, MD. “This contract reflects the respect and admiration that our nurses earn every day. We thank our nurses for their continued dedication. We also thank NYSNA for their collaboration on an agreement that puts our nurses first.”\nAs part of the agreement, hospital staffing plans will continue to be set by Albany Medical Center’s own clinical staffing committee. It includes nurses, support staff, and hospital leadership. This committee also developed the current plan, which was approved by the New York State Department of Health.\nJaimie Alaxanian, RN, added: “Albany Med nurses persevered and finally won the contract that nurses, patients and our community deserves. There is power in a union, and we will continue to build NYSNA power at Albany Med to guarantee a seat at the table and a strong nurse voice in patient care.”",
