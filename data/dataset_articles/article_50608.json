  "text": "Solidarity from the labor movement and fellow workers is needed now for over 400 striking Teamsters at Republic Services and 3,200 International Association of Machinists members on strike at Boeing.\nTeamsters at Republic in Massachusetts, Illinois and Georgia, as well as IAM District 837 members in Missouri and Illinois, face attempts by the bosses to recruit replacements to try to break their strikes. Republic bosses tried and failed to get a court order to restrict Teamsters’ picket lines.\nUnions in other industries can take the lead by organizing the broadest possible strike support. Help push back the bosses’ assaults and boost workers staying power! Bring your co-workers, friends and family to visit the picket lines.\nEvery victory won by striking workers strengthens the whole working class. The Teamsters and IAM strikes aim to push back an offensive being waged by all employers — a continual assault on the wages, job conditions and schedules of workers everywhere.\nCapitalism is a dog-eat-dog system of exploitation organized to benefit the bosses, bankers, Wall Street dabblers and a layer of meritocratic cogs that employ our labor. Our strength is our numbers, our solidarity, and the fact they can make nothing without us.\nTeamsters at Republic are fighting for better wages and lower health insurance costs. Bosses at Boeing refuse to provide pensions for new hires and are trying to force through a contract with a wage freeze for better paid workers in the last three years of a four-year deal.\nTheir fight is our fight! You can look to the Militant every week for the truth about these and other labor battles. You can reach Teamsters Local 25 at 544 Main St., Boston, MA 02129, (617) 241-8825. IAM District 837 is at 212 Utz Lane, Hazelwood, MO 63042, (314) 731-0603.",
