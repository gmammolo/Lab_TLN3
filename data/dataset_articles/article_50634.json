  "text": "BuildEx Modular-Tennessee announced it will invest $23.3 million into a manufacturing facility in Fayetteville, Tenn. on Aug. 6, 2025. The company expects to create 110 jobs. (Photo: BuildEx Modular)\nA modular housing manufacturing company is moving into Lincoln County, investing $23.3 million to retrofit an existing facility and promising to create 110 new jobs.\nBuildEx Modular-Tennessee’s facility in Fayetteville will expand the company’s capacity to produce and distribute modular housing units under its MODMAX brand to developers and clients in Southern Middle Tennessee, according to a Wednesday announcement.\nLincoln County sits on the Tennessee-Alabama border, north of Huntsville.\nThe company’s offerings include duplexes, fourplexes and small multifamily homes, according to the Modular Building Institute, a nonprofit trade organization where BuildEx Modular is a member.\nThe Southern Middle Tennessee region is among several areas of the state expected to see population growth in coming years. Fayetteville, the largest city in Lincoln County and the county seat, was home to just over 7,000 people at the 2020 U.S. Census.\nAgriculture remains Lincoln County’s largest industry, and the county is one of the state’s major producers of cattle, according to the county’s website. Lincoln County is also home to two distilleries and other manufacturing outfits producing automotive parts, swimming pools, snack foods and more.\nBuildEx Modular-Tennessee CEO Ben Gaxiola said in a Wednesday news release that the company has received a “warm welcome” from the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, local and state leadership and the Industrial Development Board of Fayetteville-Lincoln County.\nThe state’s economic development department has not yet released information on incentives offered to the company.\n“At BuildEx Modular-Tennessee LLC (MODMAX), our mission is to create quality jobs while reshaping how America thinks about housing — faster, smarter and more attainable,” Gaxiola said. “We are proud to call Tennessee home and deeply committed to making a positive impact on this community for generations to come.”",
