  "text": "Air Canada offers 32.5% increase for flight attendants in contract talks\nSource says airline also agreed to pay workers for some of the time they spend on the ground\nAir Canada offered its flight attendants an overall increase of more than 30 per cent over four years ahead of a potential strike, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.\nThe union representing the airline’s more than 10,000 flight attendants announced Tuesday that its members voted 99.7 per cent to strike, putting them in a legal position to walk off the job as soon as Aug. 16. Airlines usually begin winding down operations and canceling flights days before a potential labour disruption.\nAir Canada proposed to increase total compensation, including benefits and bonuses, by about 20 per cent in the first year of a contract and a total of 32.5 per cent over four years, said the person, speaking on condition they not be identified in order to speak about private talks.\nThe airline also agreed to pay workers for some of the time they spend on the ground — a request made by the union. Currently, Air Canada flight attendants are only paid when the aircraft is in motion, a common practice in the industry, but one which is increasingly being challenged.\n“The company has never presented this offer to the union,” Nathalie Garceau, a spokesperson for the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said by email. “If this indeed what the company plans to present when we resume negotiations on Friday, we look forward to discussing it then.”\nLast month, United Airlines Holdings Inc.’s flight attendants rejected a contract providing cumulative pay increases of as much as 45.6 per cent over five years — the agents would have been paid while passengers were boarding. Delta Air Lines Inc. became the first U.S. airline to pay them during this period.\nAir Canada and the union failed to reach an agreement during a two-month conciliation process that ended in July. The latest 10-year contract expired at the end of March.\n- Air Canada flight attendants vote in favour of strike mandate\n- Air Canada shares plunge as decline in travel to U.S. hits bottom line\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nIn a document posted on its website, Air Canada says that half of its mainline flight attendants earned more than $54,000 in 2024, excluding incentive rewards, pensions, and health benefits. Workers at Air Canada Rouge, the company’s budget brand, earn less.\nThe union’s president, Wesley Lesosky, said in a statement Tuesday that Air Canada is “exploiting their own employees by severely underpaying flight attendants or refusing to pay them at all for safety-critical aspects of our jobs.”\nA spokesperson for the airline said: “Out of respect for the negotiation process, we do not comment on what each party may or may not have offered at the negotiation table.”\nLast year, Air Canada’s pilots got a compensation increase of 42 per cent over four years in a last-minute deal, averting a strike that would have grounded more than 1,000 daily flights worldwide. That agreement was reached after a wave of substantial pay increases for pilots across North America.\nThe airline paid $4.9 billion in wages, salaries and benefits last year, representing about 23 per cent of operating costs. It posted an operating income of $1.26 billion, or about 5.7 per cent of revenue.\n— With assistance from Mary Schlangenstein.",
