  "text": "One notable trend is the continued expansion of the labour force. In the second quarter of 2025, the number of people aged 15 and above in the labour force reached over 53 million, an increase of 169,800 compared to the previous quarter, and 553,200 year-on-year. This growing workforce provides a valuable foundation to meet the country’s production and business development needs.\nEmployment has also risen steadily. The number of employed workers in the second quarter grew from 51.4 million to 52 million year-on-year. This increase was recorded across both urban and rural areas, and among both men and women. Urban employment reached 20.2 million, up by 440,600, while rural employment stood at 31.8 million, up 103,500. The data reflects stable and balanced growth across regions.\nThe structure of employment continues to shift in a positive direction. Fewer workers are employed in agriculture, while more are moving into industry and construction. In the second quarter of 2025, the service sector had the largest share of employment at 40.8% (21.2 million people), followed by industry and construction at 33.2% (17.3 million people), and agriculture–forestry–fisheries at 25.9% (13.5 million people).\nAlthough informal employment still accounts for a large share of the workforce, it has continued to decline in recent quarters. The informal employment rate in the second quarter was 63.5%, down 0.8 percentage points from the previous quarter and 1.7 points from the corresponding period in 2024.\nAccording to the General Statistics Office, social welfare and labour management policies are beginning to show clear results. More workers now benefit from improved incomes, welfare, and insurance coverage, a natural development in a modernising economy.\nLabour quality is also improving. The proportion of trained workers with qualifications or certificates rose marginally to 29.1% in the second quarter of this year. This marks a positive step toward higher productivity and enhanced economic competitiveness.\nAverage monthly income has increased across the board. In the second quarter, the average monthly wage rose to 8.2 million VND (313 USD), up from 7.5 million VND (286 USD) in the same period last year, a 10.7% increase. This upward trend was observed across all socio-economic regions and all three main economic sectors: agriculture–forestry–fisheries, industry–construction, and services. It is a clear indication of improved social welfare and living standards for workers.\nUnemployment and underemployment rates have also declined compared to the same period in 2024. Although quarterly fluctuations exist, the first six months of 2025 have seen these rates remain low and on a downward trajectory, a sign of the economy’s growing capacity to recover and generate jobs.\nDespite these achievements, several challenges remain. Informal employment, while declining, still accounts for 63.5% of the workforce, meaning most workers are not on formal contracts and are therefore more vulnerable to economic or social shocks.\nIn addition, income disparities are still a concern. Male workers earn on average 1.3 times more than female workers, and urban workers earn 1.4 times more than those in rural areas. These gaps highlight persistent inequality in income, particularly in terms of gender and regional development.\nYouth unemployment is another pressing issue. In the second quarter of 2025, the unemployment rate among youth aged 15–24 was 8.19%, nearly four times the national average, reflecting the difficulty of creating quality employment for young people. The NEET group (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) numbered 1.35 million, accounting for over 10% of the 15–24 age group, underlining the urgent need for vocational training and career orientation.\nIn addition, the proportion of trained workers remains low at around 29%. There is a pressing need to further improve workforce skills to meet national development demands.",
