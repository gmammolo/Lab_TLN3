  "text": "The recent life sentence for Mthunzi Nkabinde, who shot and killed three of his in-laws in eMzinoni, inspired a local police investigator to continue pursuing her career in criminal investigations.\neMzinoni Police Station’s Detective Constable Lethuxolo Hlengethwa said the conviction encouraged her to remain committed to her work, particularly in combating GBV.\nHlengethwa joined the SAPS and began her investigation career in 2018.\nThe case was assigned to Hlengethwa after Nkabinde killed his father-in-law, Mandla Mabuza, his wife’s sister, Nomcebo Mabuza, and his brother-in-law, Sello Masilela, at their home in Ext 4, Kanana Section, eMzinoni, in April 2022.\nShe said it was emotionally challenging, as she had initially attended the crime scene with colleagues without knowing she would later have to investigate it.\n“The incident was shocking because Nkabinde went to the Mabuza home and committed a horrific crime. This case taught me how serious and dangerous GBV is, as it leaves families with lifelong sorrow,” said Hlengethwa.\nShe said investigating GBV cases as a woman allows her to empathise with victims, which strengthens her determination to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice.\n“As a woman, I feel what the victims feel, and that alone gives me the courage to bring perpetrators to book. Nkabinde’s sentencing should serve as a lesson to anyone thinking of committing such offences,” she said.\nAccording to court evidence, Nkabinde went to his in-laws’ home to speak to his estranged wife, but an argument broke out. When she tried to flee, he shot her in the leg and neck, but she survived.\nAfterwards, Nkabinde fled to Ermelo, where he later handed himself over to the police. During the trial, Hlengethwa presented circumstantial evidence and witness testimony, which led to Nkabinde’s conviction.\nThe court heard that he intentionally killed his in-laws and showed no remorse for his actions.\nBefore handing down the sentence, the High Court judge considered the seriousness of the crime, the impact on the families and society, and acknowledged SA’s ongoing GBVF national crisis, declared as such by President Cyril Ramaphosa.\nNkabinde was sentenced to life imprisonment on three counts of murder, five years’ imprisonment for attempted murder, and one year for malicious damage to property.\nThe sentences on counts two, three, four and five will run concurrently. He was also declared unfit to possess a firearm.\nHlengethwa said there is still a long way to go to end GBV.",
