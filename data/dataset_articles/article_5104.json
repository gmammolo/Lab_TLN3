  "text": "Entertainment News\nDelhi High Court shields Jr NTR’s fame from AI deepfake menace : Deets inside\nThe Delhi High Court granted NTR Jr a John Doe injunction against unauthorized use of his name, image, and likeness via AI deepfakes. Justice Arora ruled his traits are protectable, ordering platforms to remove offending content immediately.\nNew Delhi: In a big win for Telugu superstar NTR Jr, the Delhi High Court has stepped in to protect his name, image, and likeness from illegal use.\nWebsites and sellers can’t misuse his fame anymore for profit without permission. This comes amid rising deepfakes and AI tricks targeting stars.\nCourt grants key injunction\nThe Delhi High Court passed a John Doe order on December 22, 2025, to safeguard actor Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao, known as NTR Jr. Justice Manmeet Pritam Singh Arora restrained 17 defendants, including unknown persons and websites, from using his personality traits via AI or deepfakes until the next hearing.\nThe judge noted, “Plaintiff’s personality traits and/or parts thereof, including name, likeness, and image, are protectable elements of the plaintiff’s personality rights.” He added that NTR Jr is entitled to stop third parties from selling merchandise using his image for commercial gain without consent.\nProtecting a superstar’s fame\nJustice Arora highlighted NTR Jr’s huge fame in India, built over a long career with massive goodwill and celebrity status. The court said unchecked misuse would cause irreparable harm. It ordered platforms to remove offending URLs, posts, videos, and content right away.\nE-commerce sites like Amazon must share their policies on handling such complaints under the IT Rules, 2021. Social media platforms must treat this as a formal notice.\nBroader trend in celeb rights\nThis isn’t new for Justice Arora, who recently protected Sunil Gavaskar, R Madhavan, and others like Pawan Kalyan and Salman Khan. Other Delhi High Court benches have aided Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, and Nagarjuna, too.\nThe next hearing is on May 19, 2026. This ruling strengthens defences against digital misuse in India’s growing online world.\nClick for more latest Entertainment news.
