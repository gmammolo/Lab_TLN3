  "text": "Bashar Sani Gummi, a Zamfara-based engineer, has finally regained his freedom after spending four harrowing months in the custody of armed bandits.\nGummi was abducted in the first week of October 2025, reportedly on October 5, when gunmen attacked and whisked him away to an unknown location.\nHis disappearance sparked deep concern among family members, friends, and colleagues, who anxiously awaited news of his fate amid the ongoing security challenges in the region.\nAfter months of uncertainty and distress, the abductors released him on Tuesday night, January 27, 2026, bringing a long and painful ordeal to an end.\nOn Wednesday, January 28, family members shared photos and videos of Bashar following his release. The images revealed a visibly frail man, with many describing him as a shadow of his former self—clear evidence of the physical and emotional toll of his prolonged captivity.\nWhile his return has been met with relief and gratitude, his condition has once again drawn attention to the human cost of banditry and insecurity in parts of northern Nigeria.",
