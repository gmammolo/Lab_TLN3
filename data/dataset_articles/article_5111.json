I want the judgment in Glenister II to be implemented by legislature, the executive and the administration of South Africa.\"\nHe says there is something positive in the pipeline.\n\"It so happens that there are two bills before parliament – one to establish, and another to enable a new Chapter 9 anti-corruption commission... that way of going about it removes the responsibility for countering corruption from any of the existing institutions, which would include IPID, the NPA, and the police.\"\nIn response to the question of why this has not yet been established – despite numerous recommendations – Hoffman says the problem is a lack of political will.\n\"They are either corrupt themselves, or they are beholden to somebody who is corrupt that they wish to protect.\"\nTo listen to Advocate Paul Hoffman in conversation with CapeTalk and 702’s Mandy Wiener, click the audio below:\nGet the whole picture 💡\nTake a look at the topic timeline for all related articles.",
