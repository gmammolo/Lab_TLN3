  "text": "‘Thank God this is over’ – van stopped in Louth had secret compartment to transport cocaine\nA man caught behind the wheel of a van which was transporting cocaine said to gardaí after his arrest, “Thank God this is over”.\nDundalk Circuit Court heard that Lee McBride (47) had been beaten up by the people directing him to bring the drugs to Ireland in the van which had a secret compartment.\nThe defendant, from Drogheda, with an address at Kiltole, Convoy, Lifford, Co. Donegal, appeared for sentencing via video link from Cloverhill Prison.\nHe previously signed guilty pleas to possession of drugs for sale or supply with a value of €13,000 or more and possession of a vehicle for facilitating a drug trafficking offence.\nThe haul of cocaine had a €210,000 market value.\nMr McBride was sentenced to 2 years, backdated to April 2025 when he went into custody.\nGda Leon Fox told of a traffic stop on April 28, 2025, on the N33 Ardee, Co. Louth, after a Citroen Berlingo was spotted driving suspiciously.\nThe driver and sole occupant was nervous. He was told the van was going to be searched but because of poor lighting and a busy road it was decided to bring Mr McBride and the vehicle to Drogheda Garda Station.\nGda Fox said that en route the man remarked, “Thank God this is over”.\nDuring the search a sophisticated hidden compartment was found under the floor of the van’s cargo area. It had a hydraulic rising mechanism operated by buttons on a cigarette lighter and keys. Inside the compartment was the cocaine.\nMr McBride made full admissions, telling investigators that he had financial difficulties following the collapse of his kitchen fitting business during Covid, while his cousin was “in bother”.\nHe got a phone call to collect drugs for which was he was promised €3,000. He ultimately received no money.\nThe court heard that a named individual paid for the van to be altered. The defendant was pressurised to travel to Manchester for the alterations to be carried out.\nHe was then told to make a second trip to Liverpool to pick up the cocaine.\nMr McBride was charged the morning following his arrest, since when he has remained in custody having not made a bail application.\nHe has eight previous convictions for Road Traffic offences, three for public order and one for each of theft and burglary.\nThe accused was raised and educated in Drogheda. After the Leaving Cert he studied Electronic Engineering in college.\nA self-employed kitchen fitter, he lost that business during Covid when the father of five’s marriage also broke down.\nGda Fox said that the man’s injuries from the beating were still evident when he was apprehended. The defendant was not sure what type of drugs he was bringing back.\nHe was working six days a week in the prison kitchen.\nReferencing reports, Judge Dara Hayes said that Lee McBride began drinking at age 10.\nHe twice attended Cuan Mhuire and had abstained from alcohol for 14 years until relapsing in 2003.\nThis was serious offending, the judge continued, involving a significant quantity of imported drugs.\nAnother aggravating factor was the sophisticated nature of the hidden compartment in the van.\nThe reward might not have been paid but Mr McBride did this for reward. Significant pressure was placed upon him.\nConcurrent sentences of 4 years and 2 years were imposed, backdated to April 29, 2025, with the final two years conditionally suspended.\nA forfeiture order was made for the van and an order for destruction of the drugs.\nFunded by the Courts Reporting Scheme",
