  "text": "CHANDPUR, Jan 29, 2026 (BSS) – Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami candidate for the Chandpur-3 constituency, Shahjahan Mia, has pledged to build a corruption-free and aesthetically pleasing Chandpur.\nAs ahead of the 13th national election, campaign has gained momentum across the country and candidates are making various promises to prove them worthy for the development of their respective constituencies as well as for the country.\nIn an exclusive interview with BSS, Shahjahan Mia said, “If the people elect me, I will, Inshallah, ensure all the rights of the people. In particular, I will work to resolve the severe hardships that people are currently facing. I will show a red card to corruption, Inshallah”.\nShahjahan Mia, a layer by profession, is the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami-nominated candidate for the Chandpur-3 (Sadar–Haimchar) constituency. He has been involved in Jamaat-e-Islami politics for nearly 35 years. Currently, he is serving as the district Jamaat secretary. Earlier, he was involved in the politics of Islami Chhatra Shibir.\nBSS Chandpur District Correspondent Abdus Salam Azad Jewel has interviewed him.\nBSS: What are your election pledges for the voters of your constituency?\nShahjahan Mia: Chandpur is a historic river port area. It has a vast commercial heritage, but for various reasons, the heritage of the Chandpur river port is fading. My commitment to the people of Haimchar is that if they elect me, I will, Inshallah, ensure all the rights of the people. In particular, I will resolve the severe hardships that people are facing. I will show a red card to corruption, Inshallah.\nI will work to construct a permanent embankment to prevent river erosion in Haimchar, and to renovate the town lakes to enhance the beauty of Chandpur and to build an aesthetically pleasing city. I want to clearly assure the people and you that if I am elected, there will not be even a single penny of extortion by Jamaat or by me. I will not allow anyone to engage in corruption or extortion.\nBSS: What instructions have you given to your leaders and activists regarding compliance with the electoral code of conduct?\nShahjahan Mia: I would tell my voters and the general people so that they abide by the electoral code of conduct. The current interim government is trying to make the election free, fair, and impartial. It is the responsibility of every political party to cooperate with the Election Commission. I and my party leaders and activists are making our utmost efforts to follow the electoral code of conduct. Inshallah, I will abide by the code of conduct until the end and also call upon candidates of other parties to follow the electoral rules.\nBSS: What is your position about the referendum on the July Charter?\nShahjahan Mia: The July revolution that took place on August 5 had one core objective and slogan — “A discrimination-free Bangladesh.” Due to discrimination faced by students and the people, a one-point movement to oust the then government began. Therefore, to fulfill the dreams of those who embraced martyred and those who are lying crippled on hospital beds, the all-party July Charter has been formulated. From our position, we will extend full cooperation in implementing that charter. There is no alternative to the referendum that the government has initiated to give legal foundation to the July Charter. Through the referendum, it will be conclusively proven that the people are the true owners of this country. Those who are patriotic, who want sovereignty and stability of the country, and who want to stop terrorism, corruption, extortion, and plunder — I believe they will all cast ‘yes’ vote in the referendum.\nBSS: What are your expectations regarding the upcoming national parliamentary election?\nShahjahan Mia: People are eagerly waiting for the national parliamentary election. I hope the administration will take all necessary measures to ensure voting in a fair and peaceful environment. There are still some things left to do to create a festive voting atmosphere. Our law enforcement agencies need to focus on arresting terrorists and recovering illegal arms. Impartial individuals must be assigned to election-related duties. The administration should ensure that those holding positions in different political parties are not involved in election duties in any way.\nIn the 13th national election, a total of seven candidates from different parties are contesting in the Chandpur-3 constituency. They are BNP candidate Sheikh Farid Ahmed, Jamaat-e-Islami candidate Md Shahjahan Mia, Gono Forum leader Selim Akbar, Communist Party of Bangladesh leader Md Jahangir Hossain, Gano Odhikar Parishad leader Md Zakir Hossain, Islami Andolan Bangladesh leader Md Zainal Abedin Sheikh and Bangladesh Islami Front leader AHM Ahsan Ullah.\nThere are 537,592 voters in this constituency, including 275,116 male and 262,374 female voters, along with two third gender voters. There will be 165 polling centers in this constituency.",
