  "text": "JERUSALEM POST STAFF\nThe Knesset on Monday approved a sweeping amendment to the Families of Fallen Soldiers (Benefits and Rehabilitation) Law, significantly expanding recognition, financial assistance, and long-term support for widows, orphans, and bereaved families of fallen IDF soldiers and members of Israel’s security forces.\nThe reform follows more than four years of sustained advocacy led by the IDF Widows and Orphans Organization (IDFWO), which described the amendment as a meaningful correction of longstanding gaps in state support frameworks.\nAt the center of the legislation is a broadened recognition structure, including for the first time official recognition of adult orphans up to the age of 30, a group that previously fell outside statutory protection. The law also introduces retroactive recognition for orphans aged 21–30 at the time the amendment comes into force.\n“This legislation brings us significantly closer to a reality in which the State of Israel fulfills its promise to the fallen — to accompany and support their families,” said Shlomi Nahumson, CEO of the IDF Widows and Orphans Organization. “However, the journey is not yet complete. There are still significant groups of war orphans who remain outside the support frameworks.”\nThe amendment establishes a wide range of financial, social, and rehabilitation measures. These include expanded monthly compensation for widows, new monthly payments for adult orphans, childcare assistance, increased housing and marriage grants, and long-term rehabilitation support.\nAmong the key provisions are new monthly payments for adult orphans in different age brackets, enhanced compensation for widows for loss of earning capacity, retroactive eligibility for widows bereaved since October 7, 2023, and expanded access to academic and vocational education support up to age 65.\nSpecial provisions were introduced for “double orphans”, individuals who lost both parents, including long-term monthly payments and strengthened rehabilitation frameworks. The law also expands emotional welfare services, therapeutic support, and assistance with fertility treatments.\nMK Ofir Katz, chairman of the coalition, described the legislation as “a historic achievement,” calling it one of the most significant social reforms for bereaved families in decades. He credited cooperation between the Finance Ministry, Defense Ministry, and the IDF Widows and Orphans Organization for advancing the legislation.\nWhile welcoming the reform, the IDF Widows and Orphans Organization stressed that the law does not yet provide a full response for all bereaved populations, particularly adult orphans from earlier wars who remain outside comprehensive rights frameworks. The group said it would continue to work toward a fully inclusive and equal recognition and support structure.\nFounded in 1991, the IDF Widows and Orphans Organization represents more than 18,000 widows, widowers, and orphans nationwide. Since the outbreak of the Iron Swords War, the circle of bereavement has expanded significantly, with hundreds of new widows and nearly a thousand new orphans joining its support frameworks.",
