  "text": "Mark Billingham has been honoured with the prestigious Diamond Dagger by the Crime Writers’ Association, recognising his outstanding and sustained contribution to crime fiction over a prolific career spanning more than two decades.\nThe 64-year-old author has long been regarded as one of the defining voices in contemporary British crime writing. He is best known for his Tom Thorne series, which began with his 2001 debut novel 'Sleepyhead' and has since grown into a 19-book sequence that remains one of the most recognisable detective franchises in the genre. The series has been praised for its psychological depth, social awareness, and ability to evolve with changing crime narratives, helping to cement Billingham’s reputation for consistency and range.\nResponding to the honour, Billingham expressed both surprise and gratitude, saying, “Presuming this is not an administrative error, I could not be more thrilled or honoured. To be added to a list that features most of my literary heroes is fantastic. That so many are also friends is the icing on the cake and, for me, a mark of how very special the crime-writing community is.”\nThe popularity of the Tom Thorne novels extended beyond the page when they were adapted for television by Sky One, with David Morrissey starring as the titular detective in the 'Thorne' series, which first aired in 2010. The adaptation introduced Billingham’s work to an even wider audience and reinforced the series’s place within British crime culture.\nBillingham’s 25th novel, ‘What The Night Brings’, the latest instalment in the Tom Thorne series, was published in June 2025. Alongside continuing Thorne’s story, he has also expanded his fictional universe in recent years. In 2023, he launched a new series featuring DS Declan Miller, beginning with ‘The Last Dance’, followed by ‘The Wrong Hands’. A third book in the series, ‘The Shadow Step’, is due later this year. His standalone novels include ‘In The Dark’, ‘Die Of Shame’, and ‘Rabbit Hole’, with ‘In The Dark’ also adapted for BBC One in 2017.\nNadine Matheson, chairwoman of the Crime Writers’ Association, highlighted Billingham’s broader influence on the genre, saying, “Across a remarkable body of work, Mark has consistently set the bar for contemporary crime fiction, while also being generous with his time and support to emerging writers. His influence on the genre extends far beyond his own novels, shaping the crime-writing community as a whole. For his outstanding contribution to crime fiction, his lasting impact on readers and writers alike, and his commitment to the genre, Mark Billingham is a thoroughly deserving recipient of the Diamond Dagger.”\nBefore becoming a full-time author, the Birmingham-born writer worked as an actor and stand-up comedian, including a notable role as Gary in the children’s television series 'Maid Marian And Her Merry Men'. He is also a member of the rock band Fun Lovin’ Crime Writers, alongside fellow crime writers Val McDermid, Luca Veste, Doug Johnstone, Stuart Neville, and Chris Brookmyre. The band has performed at Glastonbury in both 2019 and 2024.\nBillingham previously received the CWA’s Dagger In The Library in 2022, an award voted for by librarians. The Diamond Dagger places him among an esteemed list of past recipients, including Lynda La Plante, Ruth Rendell, P. D. James, Colin Dexter, Reginald Hill, and John le Carré.\nThe award will be formally presented at a ceremony on July 2.",
