  "text": "Science helping to catch offenders and improve efficiency\nHow evidence‑based innovation enabled faster case handling and strengthened the pursuit of justice.\nPolice forces regularly manage cases involving Possession With Intent to Supply (PWITS). These cases require careful handling of drug evidence, and the traditional process could take time because samples were usually sent to external laboratories. Thames Valley Police (TVP) recognised an opportunity to explore whether these cases could be completed more quickly while maintaining high standards of evidence.\nIn 2022, TVP piloted and evaluated Operation Yardbird in partnership with Liverpool John Moores University. Together, they developed a new in‑house method for analysing Class A drugs. This allowed evidence to be examined directly within the force.\nA clear process was agreed between the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, and the judiciary to support consistent decision‑making. The project received support from Police STAR (Science, Technology, Analysis and Research) Funding, which helps police forces trial innovative scientific approaches.\nThe in‑house method produced reliable forensic results that were accepted in court. This enabled PWITS cases to progress more quickly – the time needed to review evidence was cut by more than half, from up to 130 days to up to 50 days – and many defendants entered guilty pleas at their first hearing.\nThe streamlined approach meant more cases were ready to be charged sooner, helping ensure timely outcomes. The collaboration also strengthened links between policing, scientific expertise, and the justice system, demonstrating the value of bringing science and operational practice together.\nOperation Yardbird shows how science advice can support practical improvements in frontline work. By developing a new evidence‑handling process, the project helped make case progression faster and more efficient. It is a clear example of how scientific expertise can contribute to strong investigations and effective justice, benefiting communities through safer streets and well‑supported policing.\nSource: Office of the Police Chief Scientific Adviser",
