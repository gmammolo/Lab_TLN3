  "text": "A student from Uttar Pradesh has won a legal battle against the railways after a delayed train caused her to miss an important entrance examination and lose an entire academic year. She was also awarded Rs 9.1 lakh as compensation. The incident dates back to May 2018, when Samriddhi was travelling from Basti district to Lucknow to appear for a BSc Biotechnology entrance exam. Her examination centre was Jai Narayan PG College in Lucknow. According to reports, the intercity superfast train she was travelling on was scheduled to reach Lucknow at 11 AM, allowing her to report at the exam centre by 12.30 PM. However, the train arrived nearly two-and-a-half hours late. By the time Samriddhi reached the city, the exam gates had already closed, and she was not allowed to appear for the test. Following the incident, Samriddhi approached the district consumer commission, seeking Rs 20 lakh in compensation. Notices were issued to the Railway Ministry, the general manager, and the station superintendent. Court records show that the Railways failed to offer a satisfactory explanation for the delay. The case continued for more than seven years. During the hearings, the Railways admitted that the train was delayed but could not explain the cause or clarify why passengers were not protected from the impact of such delays. The consumer commission ruled in Samriddhi’s favour and held the Railways responsible for deficient service. As reported by Times Now, the Railways were directed to pay Rs 9.10 lakh within 45 days. The order also stated that the amount would attract 12 per cent interest if not paid within the given time. Samriddhi’s lawyer, Prabhakar Mishra, said the incident occurred on May 7, 2018. “The train delay prevented her from reaching the centre on time, and her entire academic year was lost,\" he said, as quoted by Times Now. He added that while the legal process was long and demanding, the Railways’ failure to justify the delay led the court to impose a significant penalty.",
