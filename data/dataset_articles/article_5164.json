  "text": "ISLAMABAD - As children face growing risks in digital spaces, Pakistan is grappling with an unprecedented volume of online child sexual exploitation and abuse material, receiving close to one million digital referrals annually. The scale of the challenge has made rapid identification of high-risk cases a national priority.\nTo address this, the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) has launched Katalyst, an artificial intelligence-enabled investigative system designed to strengthen Pakistan’s ability to detect, prioritise and investigate cases of online child sexual exploitation and abuse. The tool was developed through a partnership between the Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control and the UK-Pakistan Serious Crime and Law Enforcement (UPSCALE) Programme, funded by the British High Commission, and was formally launched in Islamabad.\nThe launch ceremony was attended by Minister of State for Interior and Narcotics Control Talal Chaudhry, British High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott, and NCCIA Director General (DG) Syed Khurram Ali. Speaking at the event, Talal Chaudhry commended the NCCIA and the British High Commission for enhancing Pakistan’s response to online child abuse. Reaffirming the government’s commitment to modernising law enforcement, he stressed the need to align policy and institutional reforms with rapidly evolving technologies.\n“Protecting children from online exploitation is a national responsibility,” he said. “The deployment of artificial intelligence at NCCIA reflects the Government of Pakistan’s commitment to ensuring perpetrators are identified and brought to justice.” Chairperson of the National Commission on the Rights of Child (NCRC) Ayesha Raza Farooq underscored the importance of a whole-of-government approach to tackling online child sexual exploitation and abuse. She highlighted the NCRC’s work with social media platforms, public awareness initiatives and efforts to advance a comprehensive national policy on child online protection. NCCIA DG Syed Khurram Ali said safeguarding children from online harm is a core priority for the agency. Since its establishment in April 2025, the NCCIA has handled a large volume of cybercrime reports. He noted that with the support of the Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control and British High Commission, use of AI through Katalyst will expand the agency’s capacity to process NCMEC referrals from around 1,200 to more than 100,000 per month.\nBritish High Commissioner Jane Marriott described online child abuse as a transnational crime requiring international cooperation. She said child protection remains a key UK priority domestically and internationally, and highlighted the importance of UK-Pakistan collaboration in protecting children. Emphasising the positive role of technology, she said tools like Katalyst demonstrate how artificial intelligence can be used responsibly to disrupt criminal networks and make the digital world safer for children.",
