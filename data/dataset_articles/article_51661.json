  "text": "Swastika Mukherjee calls out Uber: When 'pet-friendly' isn't enough\nSwastika Mukherjee called out Uber after an incident highlighted the gaps in their newly launched 'pet-friendly' feature on their app.\nAmong the many challenges pet parents face, finding a reliable cab service to take their furry friends from one place to another remains a major hurdle. On Thursday, actress Swastika Mukherjee called out ride-hailing giant Uber after an incident highlighted the gaps in their newly launched ‘pet-friendly’ cab service.\nWhat actually happened\nChitrangada Singh, who runs the Dulaar Amanat Foundation, an NGO in Delhi, called out Uber for its ‘lack of compassion’ towards pet animals. She was frustrated with the company's newly launched ‘Uber Pet’ feature, which allows pets to accompany their owners but at a significantly higher price. For a regular five-kilometre ride to her mentioned destination, Uber quoted a price of Rs 150, whereas the same trip under ‘Uber Pet’ shot up to Rs 487 - almost three times the original fare.\nChitrangada booked an Uber Go from Chhawla, New Delhi, to Dwarka to take six rescued puppies to a pet clinic, one of whom was in critical condition. When the cab arrived, she placed the baskets with the pups inside. However, after entering the OTP, the driver asked what she was carrying. Upon learning they were puppies, he immediately refused the ride, insisting she cancel and book a ‘pet taxi’ instead.\nUntil that moment, Chitrangada hadn’t even been aware of the pet taxi feature.\n“I pleaded with him, explaining that it was a medical emergency and we needed help immediately. He said that if he had known we were taking dogs to the hospital, he wouldn’t have accepted the ride and insisted we remove the pups from the cab,” Chitrangada told India Today.\nWith no other option at hand, she tried booking a cab under the 'Uber Pet' feature but was shocked by its steep pricing. Following her experience, she demanded answers, particularly regarding the lack of detailed information about the size and layout of the pet-friendly taxis.\nSwastika Mukherjee, who closely works with Chitrangada's NGO, later shared her post on Instagram, which sparked a discussion online.\nIndia Today also tried to find out if there was any truth to these claims. We checked the pricing for both the features - 'Uber Sedan' and 'Uber Pet' - for a distance of about 4km, and this is what we found:\nWhat the policy says\nUber’s official website states that service animals are allowed at all times, while non-service animals are permitted at the driver’s discretion.\nUnder the ‘Uber Pet’ feature, which was introduced in Bengaluru last year, riders can travel with pets, but only one is allowed per ride.\nWhen India Today reached out to Uber, this is what a spokesperson said, “We introduced ‘Uber Pet’ to meet the growing demand from pet owners who want an easy way to travel using Uber with their furry companions. It ensures that there is a safe and convenient ride available when you are travelling with your pets while providing additional earning opportunities for drivers.”\n“The surcharge for ‘Uber Pet’ covers the costs associated with vehicle cleaning and maintenance to ensure that the car is ready and comfortable for subsequent riders,” he added.\nThe problem with ‘pet-friendly’\nChitrangada Singh’s experience is not an isolated one - pet parents across India frequently struggle with transportation, accommodations, and public spaces that claim to be pet-friendly but fall short in practice.\nAyush Das, a 20-year-old engineering student with five dogs, shares his frustration:\n\"Travelling with pets is a nightmare. Cabs, hotels, and even cafes often don’t allow them. You need to keep searching and enquiring before your needs and theirs (pets) align. Limited carriers like Air India permit pet travel, but securing train bookings is another hassle. We've stopped taking our pets out - not by choice, but due to a lack of options.\"\nRashi Narang, founder of pet-care brand Heads Up For Tails, emphasises the need for change: “Travelling with pets should be a positive experience, not a struggle. I hope for a future where all pets can travel safely and comfortably with their families.\"\nThe cost factor\nBeyond accessibility, affordability is another major hurdle for pet parents.\n\"Raising a pet today is like raising a child,\" Das adds. \"A 1kg pack of quality dog food costs around Rs 1,000 and lasts barely a week for an adult dog. Add grooming, vet visits, and other expenses - especially for specific breeds - and it becomes a significant financial commitment. While it may seem otherwise, having a pet is not a luxury for some, they do it out of sheer love and compassion,” he says.",
