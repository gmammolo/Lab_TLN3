The rest of my text did, didn’t, did not get delivered.”\nWe’re also learning more about who else was on the passenger plane.\nRussian media reports two Russian figure skaters were allegedly on board of the American Airlines plane.\nUS figure skaters and coaches returning from national championships were also aboard the flight, according to the US figure skating organization.\nThe organization says in in part:\nSeveral members of our skating community were sadly aboard American Airlines flight 5342, which collided with a helicopter yesterday evening in Washington, DC.
