  "text": "Ripple has achieved a significant legal victory as the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed a federal class-action lawsuit against the company. The court upheld the dismissal of a California federal securities class action on January 27, reinforcing XRP's non-security status. The lawsuit, led by Bradley Sostack, alleged that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering through XRP sales, but the court ruled that the claims were filed too late, as XRP was publicly offered by 2013. This decision marks another major win for Ripple following a previous legal battle with the SEC, which also concluded that XRP is not a security. Ripple is now advocating for regulatory clarity, supporting the Market Clarity Act, as the White House plans to meet with industry leaders to discuss the future of crypto regulation. XRP -2.05%",
