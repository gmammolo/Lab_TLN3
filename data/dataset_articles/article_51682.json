  "text": "Do you share your makeup and skincare products with other people? It is quite common to do this especially, if you live together as it's often seen as harmless.\nBut then, sharing makeup and skincare products can pose serious risks to your skin and overall health. From bacterial infections to allergic reactions, here’s why you should think twice before borrowing or lending beauty products.\nALSO READ: Use these 5 household items to clean your makeup brushes\nRisk of bacterial and fungal infections\nMakeup and skincare products can harbour bacteria and fungi, which multiply each time they come into contact with skin. When you share these products, you also share the germs they contain.\nSome of the infections you could get include eye infections from products like mascara, and eyeliner; cold sores and herpes from lip products, and fungal acne from skincare items.\nSkin irritation and allergic reactions\nEveryone's skin is unique, with different sensitivities and allergies. Sharing products means exposing your skin to someone else’s bacteria, oils, and potential allergens. What works for your friend might trigger redness, itching, or breakouts on your skin.\nSpreading acne-causing bacteria\nIf someone has acne-prone skin, their makeup brushes, sponges, and skin care products may contain Propionibacterium acnes, the bacteria linked to breakouts. Sharing these tools or products can transfer bacteria, potentially causing pimples and irritation on your skin.\nIncreased risk of contamination\nSome skincare and makeup products require dipping fingers or applicators, which can introduce moisture and create an environment where mould and bacteria thrive. This risk of contamination is increased when multiple people use the same products.\nCross-contamination\nEven if you avoid direct product-sharing, using someone else’s makeup brushes, beauty blenders, or facial rollers can lead to contamination. Brushes collect dead skin cells, oil, and bacteria, which can transfer to your skin and cause infections, acne, or irritation.\nIn conclusion, while sharing makeup and skincare products may seem harmless, the risks far outweigh the convenience. To maintain healthy, glowing skin, it’s best to keep beauty products personal and prioritise hygiene. Your skin will thank you!\nRECOMMENDED: Stop these 5 eyeliner mistake ASAP!",
