  "text": "It does not burn fat - Expert reveals useless cosmetic procedure\nIn recent years, lipolytics have gained popularity as a method of dealing with excess fat. These drugs are used to locally reduce adipose tissue through injections. However, their effectiveness and safety are controversial among medical experts, states blogger Yana Tokar.\nHow do lipolitics work\nLipolitics can be divided into two main groups depending on the mechanism of action:\nDirect lipolytics\nDrugs of this group directly destroy the membranes of fat cells (adipocytes), causing their cytolysis - death. The main active ingredient of such drugs is sodium deoxycholate, which dissolves cell membranes, releasing triglycerides. After that, they are excreted from the body through the lymphatic system.\nIndirect lipolytics\nInstead, indirect lipolytics act by activating metabolic processes that contribute to the gradual degradation of fat cells without destroying them. The main substances in such drugs are phosphatidylcholine, L-carnitine, etc. They stimulate apoptosis (programmed cell death) and accelerate the breakdown of fat naturally.\nAre lipolytics really effective\nDespite numerous advertising promises, there is currently no accurate scientific evidence to support the sustainable effect of lipolytics. The percentage of adipose tissue destruction is individual and depends on many factors, from the composition of the drug to the characteristics of the patient's body. In addition, the effect may be temporary, and the body can compensate for fat loss by other mechanisms.\n“If lipolytics worked as advertised, I would have been a Victoria's Secret model a long time ago,” Yana wrote.\nWhy is it possible to gain weight again after lipolytics\nDespite the possible effect in reducing body fat, there are factors that can contribute to weight gain after injections:\nHypertrophy of residual adipocytes\nEven after some of the fat cells are destroyed, the remaining ones can increase in size, storing more fat.\nRedistribution of adipose tissue\nIf adipose tissue disappears in one area (for example, the abdomen), the body can compensate for the loss by storing fat in other places, such as the hips or arms.\nMaintaining energy balance\nIf a person continues to consume more calories than they expend, the body will find a way to store excess energy, which can lead to weight gain.\nHormonal changes\nThe destruction of fat cells can affect hormone levels, including leptin (the satiety hormone) and adiponectin (responsible for regulating fat metabolism). This can lead to increased appetite and slower metabolism.\nMetabolic adaptation\nThe body has a natural ability to adapt to weight changes. If some of the fat cells are destroyed, the metabolism can slow down, leading to a rapid return of fat deposits.\nLipolytics can be an auxiliary method of body shaping but they should not be considered a panacea for being overweight.\nWithout proper nutrition, physical activity, and general lifestyle control, any effect of lipolytics may be short-lived or even lead to unpredictable consequences. Before using such drugs, you should consult a doctor and assess all possible risks.\nRead also about the three main mistakes that lead to deep wrinkles.\nThis material is for informational purposes only and should not be used for medical diagnosis or self-treatment.
