  "text": "Instagram Bristol Palin just revealed she is suffering from facial paralysis on half of her face.\nThe former reality star took to Instagram Stories to share that symptoms started nine days ago.\nThe mother of three shared, “I woke up nine days ago with a weird little sensation in my face. My mouth was pulling this way and it just felt a little off. So, I went and looked in the mirror. I’m like, ‘Wow, this is looking a little weird.’”\nWithin hours the left side of her face “was numb and just paralyzed.”\nInstagram Bristol, the daughter of former Republican VP nominee Sarah Palin, explained, “Couldn’t really blink my eye, definitely had no movement on the side of my face. So crazy. [I] went to the doctor. They ran tests, they did a CT scan, [and] they put me on steroids, put me on other medications. Nothing came back with all the results. They think it’s just a case of Bell’s palsy maybe brought on by stress or lack of sleep.”\nWhile she couldn’t pin point anything she was “super stressed out about,” but added, “I think it was brought on by stress.”\nBristol told viewers, “I know I look crazy right now, but this has been such an improvement from what I was looking like.”\nShe added, “I’m finally starting to get some of the sensation back. It’s been, like, a little painful the last two days, which is a sign... good indication that it’s getting better, so praise the Lord.”\nInstagram The 34-year-old said the next time she thinks of criticizing her looks she will just be thankful for “a normal functioning face.”\nPalin also suggested Eastern medicine as well, saying, “I’ve been getting acupuncture multiple times, and that’s helped speed up the process of recovery tremendously.”\nShe went on to post some videos of herself over the past week as she struggled with the paralysis.\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic , “Bell's palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness in the muscles on one side of the face. Often the weakness is short-term and improves over weeks. The weakness makes half of the face appear to droop. Smiles are one-sided, and the eye on the affected side is hard to close.”",
