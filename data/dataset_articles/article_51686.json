  "text": "By Alexandra Bellusci ,\n2 hours ago\nMusician and actor Marianne Faithfull has died. She was 78.\n“It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of the singer, songwriter and actress Marianne Faithfull,” her spokesperson said in a statement on Thursday.\n“Marianne passed away peacefully in London today, in the company of her loving family. She will be dearly missed.”\nEnglish singer and actress Marianne Faithfull in March 1965 with her then-fiancé, British artist John Dunbar. Getty Images Faithfull was known for a slew of hits, including “As Tears Go By,” which was written by the Rolling Stones ‘ Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, with whom she had a several-year romance.\nThe song reached the UK Top 10 in 1964.\nFaithfull played herself in Jean-Luc Godard’s 1966 movie “Made in the USA,” starring Anna Karina, and made her debut onstage co-starring in Chekov’s “Three Sisters” with Glenda Jackson. She starred alongside Alain Delon in the 1968 film “The Girl on a Motorcycle,” and worked with other heavy hitters including Orson Welles and Oliver Reed.\nMarianne Faithfull with her second husband, Ben Brierly, in 1981.

Bettmann Archive Singer Marianne Faithfull on “Thank Your Lucky Stars” television show, filmed in Birmingham, England, in 1965. Redferns Born in 1946 in London, Faithfull grew up in Reading but returned to the capital as a teen.\nShortly after, she met Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham, who set her up with Jagger and Richards. Faithfull went on to have three other UK Top 10 singles in 1965, all of which also reached the Top 40 in the US.\nFaithfull married artist John Dunbar in 1965 and had a son, but left Dunbar for Jagger. They dated for four years before splitting.\nThe Post reached out to a rep for Jagger, now 81, for comment.\nBritish singer Marianne Faithfull performs at Central Park’s SummerStage in 1999. David Lefranc According to the Guardian , the singer was a muse for the Rolling Stones, once telling Jagger, “Wild horses couldn’t drag me away,” which inspired the band’s classic “Wild Horses.”\nMoves not like Jagger: How Mick’s partner Melanie Hamrick went from a prima ballerina to an erotic novelist\nHer drug struggles were also the inspiration for the songs “Dear Doctor” and “You Can’t Always Get What You Want.”\nAs Faithfull put it: “I know they used me as a muse for those tough drug songs. I knew I was being used, but it was for a worthy cause.”\nMick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull at London Airport in 1968.

Pascal Le Segretain After her addiction to cocaine and heroin worsened, she was found naked, wrapped in a fur rug, during a 1967 police search of Richards’ home, alongside the guitarist, Jagger and six other men, according to the Guardian .\n“It destroyed me,” Faithfull later said, per the outlet. “To be a male drug addict and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorizing. A woman in that situation becomes a slut and a bad mother.”\nIn the early ’70s, Faithfull lost custody of her son, broke up with Jagger and became homeless.\nShe lived on the streets of Soho in London as she tried to quit drugs. “I’d been living in a very fake sort of world in the ’60s,” she said in 2016. “Suddenly, when I was living on the streets … I realized that human beings were really good. The Chinese restaurant let me wash my clothes there. The man who had the tea stall gave me cups of tea.”\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR MORNING REPORT NEWSLETTER\nEnglish singer Marianne Faithfull poses on the set of the Rolling Stones concert film “Rock and Roll Circus” at Intertel Studio in London in 1968.

In 2007, she announced she had hepatitis C after being diagnosed 12 years prior.\nMick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull board a train in London for Bangor, North Wales, in 1967.
