  "text": "As Valentine's Day looms, many will be following the tradition of gifting flowers to loved ones.\nHowever, pet owners should exercise caution when choosing their floral gifts. Many popular flowers and plants can be harmful if ingested by pets, warns a leading vet. Certain species can cause discomfort or even severe health problems in dogs and cats.\nSean McCormack, Head Vet at Tails.com, advises that pets are naturally curious and will investigate any new items brought into the home, including flowers and plants. To avoid unnecessary vet visits or costly bills, Sean has identified five common flowers and plants that pet owners should steer clear of.\nFive popular plants that are toxic to pets\nCarnations\nCarnations, widely available in supermarkets and an easy choice for a last-minute Valentine's gift, are one such plant. While they might be budget-friendly, not only could your partner deem you 'cheap' for choosing these, but they are also mildly toxic to dogs.\nThe specific irritants causing this toxicity are unknown, whether in the petals or stem, but it's best not to risk it. If ingested, carnations can cause vomiting and diarrhoea in dogs.\nLilies\nSean has issued a cautionary note about lilies, a flower often associated with devotion and beauty, making it a popular choice for Valentine's Day. However, these flowers are toxic to dogs and cats, potentially fatal in some cases due to the insoluble oxalate crystals they contain that can severely irritate the intestinal system.\nIf ingested, lilies can cause:\n- Kidney failure\n- Seizures\n- Slowed heart rate\n- Vomiting\n- Diarrhoea\nDaffodils\nDaffodils, while visually appealing, are highly toxic to dogs. The bulbs of these flowers are particularly harmful as they contain lycorine and other dangerous compounds.\nIf consumed in large quantities, these compounds can lead to severe cardiac symptoms. Sean warns that dogs who ingest daffodils may experience abdominal pain, low blood pressure, arrhythmias, and/or diarrhoea.\nRoses\nRoses, though synonymous with romance, might not be the best choice if your Valentine has a pet. While not toxic, their thorns can cause physical harm to a dog's mouth, gums, throat, and digestive tract if swallowed.\nSean emphasises that untreated ingestion can lead to cuts, internal blockages, and even infection. He adds: \"If roses that have been dethorned have been ingested, particularly by dogs with sensitive stomachs, they may experience mild symptoms. These symptoms should resolve within a day, but it's always wise to consult a vet if concerned.\"\nTulips\nTulips, with their timeless appeal and variety of colours, are a favourite choice for Valentine's Day gifts. However, they can be harmful to dogs due to the presence of tulipalin A and B in their bulbs, which can irritate a dog's stomach lining if consumed.\nIf ingested, tulips can cause:\n- Drooling\n- Tremors\n- Breathing difficulties\n- Vomiting\nAlternative options\nSean also suggests some safer alternatives for those wishing to gift flowers to their pet-owning Valentine without causing harm to their beloved cats or dogs. These include:\n- Chinese Money plant\n- Rattlesnake plant\n- Spider plant\n- Bird’s Nest fern\n- Orchid\n- Fishbone Cactus",
