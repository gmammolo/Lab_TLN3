Please respect our privacy at this time as we are all shocked and devastated by this loss.\"\nAccording to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office, Flores passed away at home on Tuesday due to cardiac arrest, as reported by TMZ.\nHis family has not yet released an official cause of death.\nKen Flores was discovered at his home. Credit: Michael S. Schwartz/Getty\nIn one of his last social media posts, Flores reflected on his journey and his decision to cut back on drinking during the tour.\n\"So I started my tour a couple weeks ago and I’m proud to say I’ve done every single show. 5 in Portland 1 in Albuquerque and 4 in Atlanta without a single drop of alcohol. Nervous for Phoenix next weekend but I think I got it I’m not sober just wanna chill a bit,\" he shared.\nFlores first gained recognition through his YouTube videos, which quickly went viral, helping him amass a dedicated following on Instagram, TikTok, and X.\nFlores was in the middle of a US tour.

Schwartz/Getty\nBefore his rise in comedy, he worked at PNC Bank and performed at open mic nights at the Comedy Shrine.\n\"If you get that one big pop, you get bit by the standup bug and you’re addicted. Ever since I went up the first time, I couldn’t stop,\" Flores once told Comedy Gazelle.\nBeyond stand-up, Flores was a regular on podcasts and had been featured on Netflix is a Daily Joke. In December, he filmed his first comedy special, which has yet to be released.\nTributes have flooded in for Flores. Credit: Michael S. Schwartz/Getty\nHe also played a key role in creating the LatinXL comedy show alongside comedian René Humberto Valdiviezo, an initiative aimed at increasing Latino representation in the comedy scene. The show paid tribute to Flores in a heartfelt statement:\n\"LATINXL came from an idea over late night pre-pandemic convos and backyard covid shows to do something together — to break Latinos into opportunities that would usually be hard to land… while also getting our own stage to refine our comedy and enjoy our friendship while chasing our dreams. We were so proud of Ken when he made it in his dream as a kid from Aurora.\"\nThe statement continued: \"We were always rooting for him and continued to share stages to present day. LATINXL WOULD NOT exist without Ken. The XL was a nod to Ken for having an 'XTRA large personality' and being such a force… which crowds all over the country would inevitably love.\"\nOur thoughts are with Flores' loved ones at this time.",
