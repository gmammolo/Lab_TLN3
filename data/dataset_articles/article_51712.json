Your Afternoon Nap Might Be The Reason - Expert Explains How\nAfternoon naps might feel refreshing, but sleeping for too long post-lunch can slow metabolism and lead to weight gain, says a nutritionist. Research links extended naps to high BMI, heart disease, and diabetes. Experts recommend limiting naps to 30 minutes and staying active afterwards to maintain a healthy weight. Read on to know more.\nStruggling To Lose Weight? Your Afternoon Nap Might Be The Reason - Expert Explains How (Image Credits: iStock)\nWe've all been there—after a big, satisfying lunch, that wave of laziness hits, and the couch starts looking way too inviting. A quick afternoon nap feels like the perfect fix, right? It might help you recharge, but did you know that sleeping too long in the afternoon could actually lead to weight gain?\nAccording to Dr Shikha Singh, a Certified Clinical Nutritionist, as per her Instagram bio, long post-lunch naps can slow down metabolism, making it harder to lose weight—even if you're dieting. Plus, they can mess with your sleep schedule, leading to late-night cravings and overeating. Sounds like a recipe for weight gain, doesn't it?\nSo, if you love your afternoon naps but also want to stay fit, keep reading to find out how to nap the right way without packing extra pounds!\nHow Do Afternoon Naps Cause Weight Gain?\nDr Singh pointed out that research suggests a 23 per cent higher likelihood of weight gain due to frequent afternoon naps. Here’s why:\n1. Slow Metabolism – If you sleep for more than 30 minutes in the afternoon, your metabolism slows down significantly. This means that even with a proper diet, weight loss becomes much slower.\n2. Disrupts Sleep Cycle – Long naps interfere with nighttime sleep, making it harder to fall asleep on time.\n3. Increases Late-Night Cravings – Poor sleep leads to late-night hunger, which often results in overeating unhealthy snacks.\n4. Raises Health Risks – A 2023 study published in the journal Obesity found that midday naps of more than 30 minutes are associated with higher body mass index (BMI), high blood pressure, and an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes.\nHow Long Should You Nap?According to Dr Singh, the ideal nap duration is 30 minutes or less. This short nap refreshes the body without slowing down metabolism. After waking up, she recommends stretching or walking for 5-10 minutes to keep the body active and boost metabolism.\nHealthy Ways to Lose Weight\nIf long afternoon naps are slowing your weight loss progress, here are some effective ways to shed extra pounds:1. Stay Active Throughout the Day- Avoid sitting for long hours. Stand up, stretch, and take short walks every hour.\n- Engage in at least 30 minutes of physical activity daily, such as brisk walking, yoga, or strength training.\n2. Eat a Balanced Diet\n- Include protein-rich foods like eggs, chicken, lentils, and nuts to keep you full for longer.- Increase fibre intake through fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to improve digestion.\n- Reduce sugar and processed foods to avoid unnecessary calorie intake.\n3. Stay Hydrated\n- Drinking enough water prevents dehydration and unnecessary cravings.- Warm water or herbal teas after meals aid digestion and metabolism.\n4. Get Quality Sleep- Poor sleep leads to increased hunger hormones, making you crave high-calorie foods.\n- Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep at night and keep your naps short.\n5. Manage Stress\n- Stress leads to emotional eating and weight gain.- Practice deep breathing, meditation, or light exercises to reduce stress levels.\nGet\nLatest NewsLive on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines fromHealthand around the world.Pallavi Mehra author\nPallavi Mehra is a Copy Editor at Times Now and covers Health beat extensively.
