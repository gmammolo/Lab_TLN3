  "text": "Red Perch, a New York Times best restaurant in Nashville, to close in February\nOne week remains to try the restaurant's fresh seafood dishes and crispy lumpia\nThe New York Times called it one of the best restaurants in Nashville right now. Thrillist said it was one of the restaurants serving the absolute best seafood in Nashville. And it's no wonder — the fish and chips are exceptional, the clam chowder extraordinary.\nSadly, you don't have much more time to try it. The restaurant's owners Cameron and Nichole Payne have announced on social media plans to close the restaurant. The last day of service is Feb. 6.\nThat's only one more week to try the restaurant the New York Times said was worth revisiting often to \"satisfy a craving for tender, crispy fish or a simple plate of salty anchovies in good olive oil.\" That's only one more week to try crispy fried fish fillet sandwiches and fresh salmon poke.\n\"Thank you to every single person who walked through our doors, supported us, and made this journey unforgettable,\" the Paynes said in a social media post. \"We are forever grateful for the love and laughter we shared. As we close this chapter, we’re excited for what’s next but will always carry the memories of our time here with us.\n\"This may be the end of our restaurant, but it’s not the end of the relationships and stories we’ve created together. Thank you for being a part of our family.\"\nThe Paynes first opened their seafood restaurant in The Arcade in downtown Nashville. After outgrowing the original space, they moved to the Sylvan Supply in 2018.\nThey did not provide a reason for the closure or any clues about what would happen next. They also did not immediately respond to requests for comments from The Tennessean.\nCustomers, including top local chefs, flocked to social media to express surprise over the news, which many called \"heartbreaking.\"\n\"Breaks my heart to see,\" one follower wrote on the post. \"Thank you for creating my favorite excuse to plan anything on the west side just so I could sneak off for a fish sandwich.\"\nRed Perch is open Tuesday to Sunday until Feb. 6 at 4101 Charlotte Ave., suite G120, on the second floor of the Sylvan Supply building, facing the main road.",
