  "text": "Credit: Tuk Tuk Thai Editor’s note: Nosh covers food and restaurant news across the East Bay, and each week we publish one article covering all the restaurant openings and one article covering closings. Have a tip for Nosh? Submit it here .\nAli Baba Ali Baba, a Middle Eastern café coveted for its breakfast burritos, wordlessly closed its Berkeley location, a reader reports. For those willing to make the trek, its original Davis location is still open. Ali Baba was located at 1805 Euclid Ave.\nFuji Summer A reader let us know that Fuji Summer, a modern Japanese restaurant on Oakland’s Piedmont Ave., has apparently shuttered. The restaurant wasn’t reachable by phone, and the “closed” sign has reportedly been up for several weeks. Fuji Summer was located at 3858 Piedmont Ave.\nHapuku Fish Shop After 20 years of pouring heart and sole into Rockridge’s Market Hall, Hapuku Fish Shop closed for good on Jan. 26. While loyal patrons are sad to see Hapuku (and their fish and chips) go, they’ll still find fresh seafood at Market Hall: Billingsgate Seafood is slated to open in Hapuku’s place in the coming days. We’ll keep you posted. Hapuku was located at 5655 College Ave. in Oakland.\nTuk Tuk Thai Café Thanks to several tipsters, we learned that the family-run establishment Tuk Tuk Thai Café has closed for good after serving the Berkeley community for 24 years. The closure was confirmed on Tuk Tuk’s website . Tuk Tuk Thai Café was located at 2468 Shattuck Ave. in Berkeley.\n\" * \" indicates required fields\nSend a private note to the editors. *\nSee an error that needs correcting?
