  "text": "Britney Spears’s Ex-Husband Sam Asghari Reveals “most difficult” Part of Marriage January 30, 2025 – Sam Asghari reveals the strangest aspects of being married to Britney Spears during her Conservatorship.\nModel and actor Sam Asghari married Britney Spears in June 2022 and separated two years later. On the podcast Sibling Revelry , Asghari, 30, opens up about what it was like being married to the Popstar.\nOn January 27 th , 2025, he tells hosts Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson that his relationship with the “…Baby One More Time”-singer started after he worked on one of her projects. He never expected the “seven years’ worth of relationship” that came from that music video but he’s grateful for it. He explains he gained “a lot of experiences which – I like to call it a crash course in Hollywood.”\nStill, he explains that being associated with someone as iconic as Britney Spears – “someone that is labelled as the ‘princess of pop’” – did not mess with his mind. He holds that “if you follow everything with honor and respect, and you think twice before you do anything, nothing could ever go wrong.” He goes on to say that, even when things do end, it is important “to take a moment and appreciate it even happened.”\nAsghari’s optimism and passion were present during his relationship with Britney Spears. He fought hard to “provide support” for Spears despite being surprised to learn about her conservatorship.\nBritney Spears’s Conservatorship was “most difficult” part of marriage for Sam Asghari After a public meltdown, Britney Spears was placed under a conservatorship in 2008. When Sam Asghari learned about the conservatorship, he was shocked. “I was like, wait a minute. Like, I thought, I’m in America,” he told Sibling Revelry, “What do you mean someone over the age of 18 needs permission from their parents?”\nHe was shocked at the limited amount of control Spears had over her own life. He called the conservatorship “the weirdest thing to deal with” during their relationship. Despite his surprise, he put a lot of effort into providing “resources that might be helpful” to understand how and why the conservatorship happened, being there to “provide support” for Spears.\nOn the podcast, Asghari reflects on the entertainment industry in general. He said, “One of the hardest things, I think, to deal with when you go into entertainment is your parents and the people around you.” He continued, “Everybody that comes into your life that’s taken advantage: that damages you because those are the people that are closest to you.” He continued, “They take an advantage because they think, you know, you – you owe something to them or something, which is so ridiculous.”\nSpears’s conservatorship ended in 2021, which People reported was “the best day of her life”.\nWhile their marriage ended, Asghari doesn’t regret his relationship, saying “I’m always gonna be grateful and happy that it ever even happened.”\nWhat are the biggest stories trending online today?
