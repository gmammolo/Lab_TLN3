  "text": "Blame it on the bird flu or human politics. Any way you slice it, the incredible, edible egg is just so incredibly expensive. But there is a practical solution to this eggs-istential situation: Don’t use them.\nWhat’s the point of using eggs, anyway? By themselves, they’re a good source of protein. In baked goods, they provide necessary chemistry for binding ingredients and achieving palatable outcomes. Egg whites provide “lift” to dry ingredients, while yolks add both creaminess and body to a recipe.\nREAD MORE: Egg prices are soaring, and Oregon’s among the states hardest hit. Here’s why\nCommercially produced egg replacers can work in lieu of real eggs. However, I have found some products to be unpleasant looking and believe that homemade substitutions are more natural and healthy.\nA search through YouTube will turn up oodles of insights into egg-free solutions. Here are three trustworthy ones for items like cookies, pancakes, loaf cakes, cupcakes and muffins. Some tinkering with ratios might be needed with the addition of baking powder to very wet batters for the extra “poof” with the final product.\nAlso check out the accompanying video with professional chef and Bigger Bolder Baking show host Gemma Stafford — Biggerbolderbaking.com. The demonstration she illustrates with a pound cake recipe uses a variety of egg stand-ins like silken tofu, banana, yogurt, buttermilk, sweetened condensed milk and flax egg. She even breaks down exact measurements on a handy chart via this link — Bit.ly/EggSubstitutes.\nHere are a few other easy swaps for eggs.\n1. Apple or pear sauce\nIt’s easy to make from scratch, but the unsweetened, store-bought version is just as ideal. Pears are delicious but have a graininess that may or may not be desirable. In general, for every egg you would have used in a recipe, substitute 1/4 cup applesauce. Optionally, add 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder per egg to give more “lift” with the additional moisture.\n2. Yogurt, sour cream and ricotta cheese\nUse full-fat dairy products as an egg substitute at a ratio of 1/4 cup per egg. This is particularly great (and forgiving) in pancake recipes.\n3. Cornstarch and water\nFor every egg, stir 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 3 tablespoons of warm water. Mix until the cornstarch fully dissolves.\n— Pamela Silvestri is Advance/SILive.com food editor.
