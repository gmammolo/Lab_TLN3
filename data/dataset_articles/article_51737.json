  "text": "By Chris Piner ,\n5 hours ago When it comes to love, every person knows the pain of heartbreak. The decision to end a relationship can be a daunting task when the people involved share a love for several years. But thanks to the internet, countless people shared their stories of heartbreak and how some lovers decided to end it without directly speaking to the other person. And even though Andrew Millsaps continues to carve out his spot in country music, he recently recalled how his fiancée decided to call it quits just as he was about to take the stage.\nAppearing on Taste of Country Nights , Millsaps opened up about his past relationships. Although part of Neon Union with Leo Brooks, the rising star put his time on stage on hold as he recalled his heartbreak. The entire ordeal happened when he was in Baltimore. Going through a soundcheck, Millsaps received a message on his phone. At the time he was engaged to his fiancée after being together for nearly five years. But even with years of love and an engagement ring, nothing prepared him for what came next.\nAfter learning via text message that his future wife was leaving him, Millsaps took some time to himself to ponder the words. According to the singer, his ex-fiancée struggled with homesickness and wanted to go back to North Carolina. While understanding her motivation, Millsaps continued forward with his music career. With the singer not ready to step off the stage, his fiancée decided to call it quits.\nAlthough having a broken heart, Millsaps promised Taste of Country Nights that it didn’t stop Neon Union from taking the stage and putting on a stellar performance. But for the singer, the entire concert came with a great deal of heartache.\nAndrew Millsaps Ready To Release Debut Album With Neon Union As for the future, Neon Union prepared to release their debut album, Good Years , on Friday, January 31. Having released songs like “Bout Damn Time”, the duo also opened for stars like HARDY, Pitbull, and even Scotty McCreery.\nOver the last several weeks, Neon Union dropped the names of songs on their new album, which included titles like “Helluva High”, “This Side of the Dirt”, and “Luck Don’t Live Around Here.” Don’t miss Good Year, which will hit shelves on Friday.\n(Photo by Ayisha Collins/Getty Images)\n79",
