  "text": "By Jenel Treza Albuquerque ,\n57 minutes ago\nChris Evans may have just broken hearts all around the world, seeing that he said he would not be returning for the upcoming Avengers film, Doomsday .\nEsquire has reported that when Anthony Mackie, the new Captain America, sat down for an interview, he revealed that Evans, who embodied the role for most of our childhoods, will no longer return as the beloved character.\nWhile he was kind enough to grace us with his presence in the latest Deadpool film, it looks like Chris Evans and an Avengers film collaboration may not be in the cards for a while.\nEither way, the internet is going ballistic, and users are weighing in with some of the most hilarious opinions ever. We've rounded up all of them for you to enjoy.\nDisclaimer: This piece reflects the writer's opinion; the reader's discretion is advised. Do let us know in the comments what you think should have made the cut.\nAll of the funniest fan reactions to Chris Evans' news that he won't be reprising his role as Captain America in Avengers: Doomsday Check out what this one user jokingly stated:\n\"He didn’t say secret wars tho lol.\"\nCheck out some of the other hilarious comments:\n\"No this means we are stuck with “Captain America means everything in the world but America”. Damn,\" one user sarcastically said. \"we do NOT believe him,\" someone else jested. '“Yeah, no… happily retired!” Yeah until that money start running dry then he’ll be back,' another quipped. \"nice try guys but you aren’t getting me twice with the same movie,\" one more jokingly stated. Scores online were in disbelief at learning the news, with some even pointing out that Spiderman actor Andrew Garfield also denied the possibility of him reprising his role... until he did so alongside Tom Holland and Tobey Maguire. Check out some more comments:\n\"Don’t trust him,\" one user joked. \"Check back in after opening weekend,\" someone else humorously advised. One user reacted with this hilarious meme of the actor himself:\nAnother jokingly pointed out that they'd heard these comments somewhere once before:\nYet another pointed out that it's like we're being bamboozled by Andrew Garfield all over again:\nYet another questioned the actor's supposed claims:\nOne user did, however, express hostility and grievances that the OG Captain America may never grace the screen again with this hilarious meme:",
