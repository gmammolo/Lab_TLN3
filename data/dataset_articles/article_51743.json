  "text": "The next Insidious movie is getting pushed back. Sony Pictures originally planned to release Insidious 6 in August 2025, but that’s no longer happening. Instead, it’s been delayed by a full year and is now set to hit theaters on August 21, 2026 .\nThis comes after Insidious: The Red Door became the highest-grossing movie in the franchise. The 2023 film was meant to wrap up the story, but after its massive success, a follow-up was given the green light. However, the delay means fans will have to wait longer to see what happens next.\nSony made this decision because another film, Caught Stealing , is taking its original release date. The new crime thriller, directed by Darren Aronofsky, stars Austin Butler, Zoë Kravitz, Regina King, and Liev Schreiber. The studio shifted Insidious 6 to make room for it.\nDetails about the next chapter remain a mystery. It’s unclear if Insidious 6 will focus on the Lambert family or explore other characters connected to The Further. The ending of The Red Door left things open with a post-credits tease, but no one knows exactly where the story will go.\nThere’s also the upcoming spinoff Thread: An Insidious Tale , featuring Mandy Moore and Kumail Nanjiani. That movie is separate from Insidious 6 but will still tie into The Further in some way.\nWhile it’s frustrating to wait, this delay could be a good thing. The Red Door gave the Lambert family a satisfying ending, and if they return, the story needs a strong reason that doesn’t undo that closure. With extra time, the writers can make sure Insidious 6 is worth it.\nHave something to add? Let us know in the comments below!",
