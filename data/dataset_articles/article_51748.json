  "text": "By Cassidy Morrison Senior Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com ,\n6 hours ago A sudden droop on one side of the face, an inability to blink fully, and slurred speech – these are the hallmark signs of Bell’s palsy, a temporary paralysis of the facial nerve.\nWhile the condition is relatively common – there are 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 people yearly – some experts have reported an increase in cases compared to pre-pandemic years.\nResearchers are increasingly pointing to viral illness, Covid specifically , as a trigger for Bell’s palsy.\nLooking at the records of people diagnosed with the virus from January to December of 2020, they found about 0.1 percent of people were diagnosed with Bell's palsy within eight weeks of their Covid diagnosis - but about nine percent of people with a history of Bell's palsy had their paralysis return within two months of their Covid diagnosis.\nAdditionally, analyzing later data, researchers found there was a nearly seven percent increased risk of Bell's palsy in people with Covid compared to people who were vaccinated against the virus.\nBell’s palsy arises when the seventh cranial nerve, which carries nerve signals that control your facial movements and expressions, becomes inflamed.\nIn addition to causing sudden freezing of one side the face, Bell's palsy causes the mouth to droop and the eyes to become extremely dry.\nHaving a weak immune system caused by stress, illness, physical trauma, or an autoimmune system can also bring about facial paralysis. Former reality TV star Bristol Palin has attributed her nine-day bout of Bell's palsy on stress.\nBell’s palsy arises when the seventh cranial nerve, which carries nerve signals that control your facial movements and expressions, becomes compressed or inflamed The paralysis progresses quickly, causing maximum weakness within a few days to a week of onset. Most people fully recover within three months, but some may take up to six months for complete recovery.\nResearchers who uncovered the rise in Bell's palsy linked to Covid tracked more than 348,000 patients for up to eight weeks after their Covid diagnosis to see if they developed Bell’s palsy.\nOut of these patients, 284 were diagnosed with BP, or 0.08 percent of the total, within eight weeks of their Covid diagnosis. Out of these,\nIn total, 1,525 patients had a history of Bell's palsy before getting Covid, and of those, about 8.6 percent had it come back within two months of getting Covid.\nWhen researchers compared people who had Covid to 63,551 vaccinated people, they found that those with the virus were 6.8 times more likely to be diagnosed with BP than those who were vaccinated.\nTheir report was published in JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery .\nThere is no standard course of treatment for Bell’s palsy; doctors let it resolve on its own unless a person clearly has an active infection that could have triggered it.\nIn the US, there are 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 people every year. Overall rates of the condition have remained relatively stable over the years.\nDoctors typically prescribe steroids to reduce inflammation and swelling around the facial nerve.\nIn addition to causing one side of the face to droop, in Ms Palin’s case, it pulled her face back and rendered her unable to fully close her left eye Steroids can reduce recovery time by reducing inflammation.\nIn addition to causing one side of the face to droop, in Ms Palin’s case, it pulled her face back and rendered her unable to fully close her left eye.\nIn addition to steroids, doctors might also prescribe over the counter artifical tears to alleviate the uncomfortable dryness in the eyes caused by incomplete blinking.\nMs Palin has opted to undergo acupuncture, which she has found helpful for relieving pain in her face and believes has sped up her recovery.\nAcupuncture is believed to activate the body’s nervous system, potentially improving blood circulation to the affected facial nerves, which might help speed up recovery and reduce inflammation.\nAlthough evidence that acupuncture really quickens recovery is slim, it has been uncovered nonetheless.\nIn 2015, researchers from the UK and China looked at 14 clinical trials involving 1,541 participants, comparing acupuncture with other treatments. The results showed that acupuncture helped more people recover from Bell's palsy compared to other therapies, with a higher rate of improvement.\nPregnant women, especially those in their third trimester, are most likely to experience Bell's palsy. Doctors are not entirely sure why, but posit that increased fluid retention during pregnancy could put pressure on facial nerves, making them more prone to compression.\nPalin said the scary ordeal kicked off nine days ago when she first noticed that her face was suddenly 'pulling' to the left It also may arise from high levels of estrogen and progesterone affecting nerve function and increasing susceptibility to inflammation.\nPeople with diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity are also more prone to Bell's palsy.\nMost people reach full recovery, but around 30 percent do not, developing chronic facial asymmetry, facial tightness, and involuntary or abnormal muscle movements in the face.\nThe condition can have a considerable psychological impact. The sudden onset of facial numbness is alarming and distressing, while an inability to move one side of the face can become frustrating and anxiety-inducing.\nMs Palin said she would never again ‘pick [her]self apart’ over her appearance.\nShe said: ‘[When I feel insecure], I am gonna remember this and just be so thankful for a normal functioning face because this has been wild.’\n1",
