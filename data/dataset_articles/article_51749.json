  "text": "Mulberry has “neglected to connect” with British customers in recent years and plans to sell more bags in the UK, rather than focus too much attention on China, as part of the path to profitability outlined by its new CEO.\nAndrea Baldo, the former Ganni CEO who joined Mulberry in September 2024, said that the British heritage brand had “lost so much business” in the UK in recent years that there was “a huge space” for the company to grow.\nFounded in 1971 in Somerset by Roger Saul, Mulberry is most famous for its luxury leather handbags. But it has seen profits nosedive of late, partly as a result of waning appetite for luxury goods among Chinese consumers, previously a key market for the fashion company.\nBaldo said the company would now focus less on China and close 12 stores across its Asian estate, while aiming to open more shops in UK cities in future.\nIt will also re-enter the wholesale and outlet sales markets, including by striking new deals to sell its items at John Lewis and Flannels. Mulberry has no presence in Birmingham or Liverpool, he said, and it will look to expand in those cities in future.\nAndrea Baldo\nThe UK expansion comes after retailers such as Marks & Spencer have warned that rising company taxes and falling consumer sentiment could hit their home market.\nWhile Baldo admitted those factors were “a challenge”, he added: “With the right product, distribution and communication, we are able to take advantage (of the UK market) no matter where the economic conditions are.”\nBaldo wants the company to focus on its “Britishness” and “cultural relevance” and simplify the business to counter plunging profits.\nBaldo laid out plans to cut costs by a quarter compared with the last financial year, following a period of “suboptimal” performance, and also said Mulberry would look to expand in the US.\nA classic Mulberry design\nThe company made nearly one-fifth less in revenue over the key Christmas period than the previous year, blaming a “challenging” business environment, figures released today reveal. That was even worse in Asia, where sales slumped by 28% compared with the festive period in 2023. In Europe and the US, by contrast, sales grew 11% year-on-year.\nBaldo said: “We need to get back to where we came from and return to the spirit of Mulberry.” He added that for the company to succeed “the business model needs to be simplified”.\nMulberry already announced plans to slash roughly 85 jobs, about one quarter of its workforce, before Christmas.\nThe turnaround plan comes after loss-making Burberry also said it would focus more on its British history to make more sales.\nMeanwhile, Mulberry has also hired a new finance head, Billie O’Connor, a former Marks & Spencer and Selfridges executive.\nBaldo said of the appointment: “Billie has a wealth of experience working in the consumer retail space and has spent time leading finance teams through turnarounds.”\nRead more on Mulberry's latest financial statement and Andrea Baldo's strategy here .\nMain image: Alamy",
