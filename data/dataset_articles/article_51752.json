  "text": "By Gee NY ,\n1 hours ago Marsai Martin is speaking out about the sudden cancellation of her Disney Channel series Saturdays —and she’s not holding back.\nDuring a recent appearance on Keke Palmer’s podcast , Baby, This Is Keke Palmer , the 19-year-old actress and producer got emotional when discussing why the show was pulled after just one season.\n“Girl, only God knows,” Martin said. “I think it’s because they never really know how to promote Black television . It just kind of got overshadowed with a bunch of other projects in the lineup.”\nAs the executive producer of Saturdays , which aired from March 24 to May 12, 2023 , Martin expressed disappointment , particularly for the show’s young stars.\nThe series featured three Black girls— Danielle Jalade, Daria Johns, and Peyton Z. Basnight —as best friends navigating their teenage years at a Chicago roller rink. Martin saw the project as a major opportunity for its lead cast , calling it their potential “breakthrough” moment .\nMartin, who made history as the youngest executive producer in Hollywood with Little , has been a vocal advocate for Black representation in film and television . While Saturdays had a dedicated fanbase , she believes the lack of proper promotion played a role in its cancellation.\n“For our Black girls , our three main leads, for this show to be like their breakthrough in a sense for being seen… I can never talk about it without getting emotional,” she added.\nDespite the setback , Martin remains one of the most influential young creatives in Hollywood, continuing to break barriers and push for diversity in entertainment .\n4",
