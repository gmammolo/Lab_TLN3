  "text": "Every year, a bewildered groundhog is paraded in front of adoring crowds to predict the weather – but PETA thinks it's time to give the little guy a break and let a cake do the job instead.\nGroundhog Day – the annual tradition where a groggy rodent is yanked from its burrow to predict the weather – might be due for a makeover. At least, if PETA has anything to say about it. Their latest proposal? Retire Punxsutawney Phil and replace him with… a cake.\nA Sweeter Groundhog Day?\nThanks to Groundhog Day (yes, the Bill Murray movie that somehow feels autobiographical every February), this bizarre ritual is now known far beyond Pennsylvania. Every year on February 2, Phil emerges – or rather, is dramatically lifted – to determine whether winter is here to stay or spring is on its way. Shadow means six more weeks of misery, no shadow means warmer days ahead.\nCharming? Sure. But PETA says it's time to let Phil enjoy his well-deserved retirement, free of cameras and weather-predicting responsibilities he never signed up for.\nTrade A Groundhog To A Cake\nPETA sent a letter to the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club with a proposal: replace Phil with a cake.\nTheir reasoning? Groundhogs are not known for their love of public speaking. In the wild, they dig elaborate underground tunnels, chatter with their fellow marmots, and occasionally climb trees. What they don't do – at least not voluntarily – is performing meteorological stunts for an audience. As PETA President Ingrid Newkirk puts it: \"Phil has been denied all of that for a tired old gimmick.\"\nAnd so, PETA's solution: a cake, freshly baked and (presumably) humanely sourced. They even promise to send a new vegan cake every year, complete with a foolproof weather prediction system. Blue filling? Winter is dragging on. Pink filling? Spring is coming. Basically, it's a Groundhog Day-themed gender reveal party, minus the explosions and accidental forest fires.\nWill the tradition be replaced by an annual dessert ritual? Probably not. Let's face it – watching a cake get sliced might be just as exciting as seeing a slightly confused groundhog held aloft like a discount Simba. Personally, I like cake. And I would gladly give Phil his well-deserved retirement.",
