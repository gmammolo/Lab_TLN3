  "text": "By Brooke Williams ,\n3 hours ago\nDENVER ( KDVR ) — Denverites pay some of the highest monthly rent costs of any city in the country. Some areas within the city are more than twice as expensive as others and some neighborhoods may offer relief.\nDenver fell slightly in the ranks this month from No. 22 to No. 23 , but remains one of the most expensive cities for renters in the U.S., according to rental website Zumper’s National Rent Report for January .\nReport: 3 CO cities among largest in U.S. with the biggest drop in rent prices Rent prices have decreased significantly over the last year, but as spring draws nearer, prices are slightly increasing at the end of January. According to the report, rent prices fell 4.5% for one-bedroom units and 2.5% for two-bedroom units over the last year. Prices rose slightly for both over the last month, increasing .6% to $1,710 and .9% to $2,310 respectively.\nMedian rent costs increased nationally this month too, up .3% to $1,534 for a one-bedroom unit and .1% to $1.907 for a two-bedroom unit.\nHow rent varies by neighborhood in Denver There are some nearby cities where rent is cheaper than in Denver , but prices even vary between neighborhoods of the Mile High City.\nZumper data: These nearby cities are cheaper to rent in than Denver In fact, renters in the most expensive neighborhood paid about $1,400 more than renters in the cheapest neighborhood for January rent, according to data provided to FOX31 by Zumper.\nNeighborhood Jan. 2025\n1-bed median rent Cole $2,400 Cherry Creek $2,390 LoDo $2,200 Belcaro $2,180 Platt Park $2,130 Speer $2,120 Golden Triangle $1,990 Lincoln Park $1,920 Jefferson Park $1,920 Highland $1,920 Five Points $1,880 Washington Park $1,800 Stapleton $1,760 Southmoor Park $1,750 Central Business District $1,740 Overland $1,720 City Park $1,700 Washington Park West $1,700 City Park West $1,690 Marston $1,680 Baker $1,660 Lowry Field $1,660 Denver International Airport $1,640 Hampden South $1,630 University Hills $1,630 Windsor $1,620 Park Hill $1,610 Gateway $1,590 Uptown $1,570 Montclair $1,530 West Colfax $1,520 Wellshire $1,510 Globeville $1,470 West Highland $1,430 Sloan Lake $1,430 Cheeseman Park $1,390 Hale $1,380 Virginia Village $1,360 Bear Valley $1,320 Congress Park $1,320 Kennedy $1,320 Hampden $1,310 Capitol Hill $1,290 University $1,240 Washington Virginia Vale $1,210 East Colfax $1,190 Goldsmith $1,160 Vicca Park $1,120 Ruby Hill $1,000 Zumper data for Denver neighborhood rent prices in January 2025 Zumper provided listing data on median one-bedroom rent prices for the first month of the year. The neighborhoods in the Zumper database do not line up exactly with the official Denver neighborhood boundaries , but they offer insight into the range in rent prices across the city.\nFor the year ahead, Zumper said in its 2024 annual report that it expects Denver rent prices to show “modest growth rates” as supply levels are expected to remain high nationwide.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
