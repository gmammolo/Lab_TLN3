  "text": "The Post Malone-inspired Oreo is a replacement-level flavor that falls into the bin of miscellaneous caramel-adjacent flavors that all taste pretty similar.\nSalted Caramel Brownie. Toffee. Snickerdoodle. Kettle Corn. They’re all basically the same cookie with a different name tag.\nThe Post Malone Oreos has a chance to be something new and remarkable. But there’s one decision they made that threw it all off.\nThat one chocolate cookie.\nPost Malone Oreos | Review\nWhat are Post Malone Oreos? It starts with a swirl of salted caramel and shortbread creme. That’s then sandwiched between one golden Oreo cookie and one classic Oreo cookie.\nThe golden cookie pairs well with the filling. The chocolate cookie does not.\nI can see the plan here. By going with shortbread, caramel and chocolate, they were set up for a vibe similar to a Twix or millionaire’s shortbread.\nThat’s not what happened.\nSo what do they taste like?\nThe mixture of caramel and shortbread flavors in the filling creates a nice wave of sweetness that’s more balanced than most caramel Oreo offerings. It’s sweet and buttery rather than a pure firehose of sugar.\nThe golden Oreo cookie pairs well with that combo. But that chocolate cookie doesn’t. Instead of providing sweet chocolate flavor (like a Twix), it serves to mute the already tempered sweetness of the filling. Instead of balancing things out, the chocolate cookie just makes things boring.\nAt first glance, this flavor seems super insteresting. It’s inspired by Post Malone. There’s a swirl of multiple flavors. It has a cool cover and aesthetic.\nThen it winds up being a lot like “Dune.” There’s a lot of excitement about the story and the cinematography. You hear people talking about the “spice melange.”\nBut then you sit down, throw it on HBO Max and fall asleep while Timothée Chalamet has a long, philosophical conversation with a guy who’s watering a tree.\nSo are they any good?\nWell, they’re Oreos. So of course they taste good. Most Oreos taste good.\nFor reference, I also really liked “Dune.” But even I can acknowledge the first movie really drags and can be sleep-inducing.\nNow, what if the Post Malone Oreo did a shortbread cookie and a chocolate/caramel filling? I think that would have worked awesome. The sweetness level of the chocolate would have vibed with the other two components and driven home the Twix-adjacent concept.\nUpdated All-Time Oreo Rankings\nI’m adding this Oreo to my ongoing rankings, which have been in the works since 2014.
