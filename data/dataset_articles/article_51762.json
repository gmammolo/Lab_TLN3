  "text": "Maci Bookout and Ryan Edwards are no strangers to being teen parents. However, with their son, Bentley, recently turning 16, the co-parents seem to be worried that history will repeat itself. The Teen Mom stars have opened up about their fears regarding their son Bentley possibly following in their footsteps. In a teaser for Teen Mom: The Next Chapter, Ryan and his then-girlfriend can be seen visiting Maci and her husband, Taylor McKinney. It was then that the concerns began to rise.\nReports from In Touch Weekly state that once Ryan Edwards got to the home, he and Maci Bookout then discussed their son’s upcoming 16th birthday. According to Maci, Bentley wants all of his “parental figures” to attend his birthday celebration. The young man allegedly wants to have his get-together at a golf course. However, once the co-parents hatched the idea of getting Bentley a car for his birthday, something seemed to click in Maci’s head. It then dawned on her that ground rules would have to be set regarding this new car. That being said, Ryan did not seem too worried about what Bentley would be doing with this newfound freedom. However, Maci was quick to blurt out that, “He could get somebody pregnant.”\nRyan Edwards Makes Jokes as Maci Bookout Worries for Her Son\nAlthough that would be a serious situation. Ryan still found time to slip in a joke as he said, “That don’t have anything to do with a vehicle.” However, Maci continues on by stating that she and Taylor have been talking about whether Bentley is “sexually active.” In a quick fashion, Ryan would then counter by telling Maci that by telling Bentley not to do something over and over again, she would push him to do that exact thing. Maci then ends the topic by hoping Bentley is at least using protection.\nMaci Bookout and Ryan Edwards have had plenty of ups and downs throughout their parenting journey. However, Maci recently opened up about how the two were able to create a healthier co-parenting relationship. Bookout also stated that they have a long way to go before things are ideal. However, this seems like a very good start for the former couple.\nBeing able to remain on good terms for the sake of your children most likely takes a lot of energy and effort. However, the hard work seems to have paid off, as Bentley now gets his family together for his 16th birthday. Fans of the family seemingly can’t wait to see how everything plays out, as for now, they will have to wait.",
