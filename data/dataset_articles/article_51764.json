  "text": "Burning your bra is not feminism: Actress Bhagyashree ADVERTISEMENT Appearing on a podcast aired by Hauterrfly, Maine Pyar Kiya fame heroine Bhagyashree said that feminism is not about wearing what you want and doing things that men do, such as smoking and boozing. In a viral video clip, Bhagyashree is heard opining that women who adhere to feminism have got it totally wrong. \"When you say that patriarchy has been going on for a long time and we want to rebel. So there have been these whole bra-burning women that go around and they say we will wear what we like, we’ll talk how we want. But how is that equality? How is it equality that you abuse, or wear less clothes, or misbehave or get drunk,\" she said. Bhagyashree also suggested that true femininity lies in being a nurturing, caregiving person. Bhagyashree was seen in Prabhas' Radhe Shyam in 2022. Her son Abhimanyu and daughter Avantika Dassani have also been working in movies.",
