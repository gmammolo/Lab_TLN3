  "text": "By Courtney Shapiro ,\n4 hours ago We all know that things like stress or diet changes can temporarily elevate our blood pressure. But you might not actually notice your BP gradually increasing over time unless you’re actively monitoring your blood pressure numbers. Why? High blood pressure symptoms in women aren’t always obvious and can sometimes be written off as other minor health conditions. That’s a problem, since hypertension—chronically high blood pressure—can raise the risk of heart disease, heart attack and stroke. It’s even been dubbed a “silent killer”.\nFortunately, treating high blood pressure and bringing your numbers back into a healthy range (more on that below) can safeguard your heart and ward off potential health problems. The first step toward doing that: Learning how to recognize the symptoms of high blood pressure. Here, experts share everything you need to know, from risk factors and subtle signs to watch for to effective treatment options.\nWhat is considered high blood pressure? Hypertension is when your blood pressure readings consistently show 130/80 mmHg or higher, according to the American Heart Association . “The first number (systolic) measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats, and the second (diastolic) measures the pressure in your arteries between beats,” explains Gowri Rocco, MD , founder and president of Optimum Wellness & Longevity, specializing in women’s health.\nIt’s one of the most common problems doctors encounter with patients. “Readings between 120 to 139 systolic or 70 to 89 diastolic are also considered in the range of pre-hypertension or elevated blood pressure,” adds Concetta Milano, MD , a cardiologist at Cardiology Consultants of Philadelphia.\nWellness New Study Finds Arm Position Can Skew Blood Pressure Results A recent Johns Hopkins University study found small details like where your arm is positioned or how you’re sitting could make a big difference in the accuracy of your blood pressure reading—and in some cases, even lead to a misdiagnosis of hypertension. To learn more, we spoke with Kieran Sheridan, a physiotherapist and founder of […] Common causes of high blood pressure in women According to Dr. Milano, elevated blood pressure levels can be caused by:\nA family history of hypertension A diet high in sodium Untreated sleep apnea Obesity Certain medications (such as NSAIDs, decongestants and antidepressants) Alcohol use Anxiety or stress Smoking Lack of physical activity In rare cases, hypertension can be caused by “blockages in the kidney vessels or adrenal tumors,” Dr. Milano adds.\nHigh blood pressure symptoms in women Hypertension can be difficult to spot without getting your blood pressure checked. That’s because there are often no visible symptoms. Even though “many individuals with high blood pressure may not experience any symptoms, some people may experience headaches, blurred vision , chest pain, shortness of breath and dizziness,” says Estelle Jean, MD, FACC , a cardiologist at MedStar Health.\nSince these symptoms are not specific to high blood pressure and could indicate other underlying conditions, Dr. Jean adds that routine medical examinations are essential for monitoring blood pressure and overall health.\nMenopause may increase hypertension risk While high blood pressure generally presents similarly in both men and women, there are some differences worth noting. “Women going through menopause experience an increased risk of developing high blood pressure due to hormonal changes and weight gain, and some types of birth control pills can increase blood pressure in women,” says Dr. Jean. Women may also be particularly susceptible to subtle high blood pressure symptoms such as fatigue, anxiety or palpitations, she adds.\nIf you notice any warning signs of hypertension, schedule an appointment with your doctor. It’s also vital to keep up with your annual physical, where your doctor will check your blood pressure and take note of any changes. Want to check your readings more regularly? Consider a portable blood pressure cuff you can use at home, such as Withings BPM Connect .\nHow to treat high blood pressure Depending on your blood pressure readings, your doctor could recommend a combination of lifestyle changes and medication. “Some simple strategies involve maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly and adopting a healthy diet,” explains Dr. Jean. “This includes low-sodium foods, limited alcohol intake and reduced caffeine consumption.\"\nShe also recommends that you have effective techniques for managing stress , such as meditation or therapy. Also important? Quality shut-eye. Getting 7 to 9 hours of quality sleep a night can play a critical role in maintaining healthy blood pressure levels.\nWellness How To Lower Your Blood Pressure Naturally in as Little as 15 Minutes Lowering your blood pressure can be delicious and fun — really! — here's how When to see your doctor about high blood pressure Regular exams are key when it comes to managing your blood pressure, especially if you’re going through menopause, have a family history of hypertension or are over 65. However, “if your blood pressure remains elevated despite these non-pharmacologic therapies for three months, then a discussion should occur with your doctor to determine an appropriate blood pressure medication for you,” says Dr. Milano.\nFor more health concerns to pay attention to\n6 Heart Attack Symptoms in Women You Should Never Ignore\nEarly Symptoms of Parkinson’s Experts Want You to Know and When to See a Doctor\nThe Early Warning Signs of FTD—A Type of Dementia Doctors Say Is Easy to Miss\nThis content is not a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.
