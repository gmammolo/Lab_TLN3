  "text": "CHICAGO – It’s last minute gift time, and Paramount Pictures has the Anniversary and Special Edition DVD collections that make great stocking stuffers for the cinema buff in your life. The videos below will highlight the titles, either celebrating major anniversaries with deluxe 4K Ultra HD releases, or packages of special release editions.\nFilm Review: Lackluster ‘Dog Man’ Barks Up an Unfunny Tree\nPatrickMcDon January 30, 2025 - 9:15am\nCHICAGO – A Big ‘ARF’ of rejection for this animated mutt that fails to fetch many laughs. Source book author Dav Pilkey (“Captain Underpants”) came up with Dog Man while in the second grade, and that’s about the upper age limit of those who may still find these sort of dim-witted antics entertaining.\nAfter a gruesome accident, a cop and his trusty dog are injured and surgeons sew the dog’s head onto the cop’s body. So Dog Man (vocal effects by Peter Hastings) is a crime fighter who loses focus whenever a ball is around and other assorted dog related behaviors. He lives in a dog house and that’s about it. His arch nemesis is Petey the Cat (Pete Davidson) … a megalomaniacal cat out to take over the world with various harebrained contraptions, but is constantly thwarted by Dog Man. The movie is largely based on the first few Dog Man books, but exhausts its source material in about the first 20 minutes. So it’s left to narratively chase its own tale for another hour or so to meet the bare minimum of cinematic running time.\nContinue reading for Spike Walter’s full review of “Dog Man”\nDog Man\nPhoto credit: Universal Pictures\nContinue reading for Spike Walter’s full review of “Dog Man”",
