  "text": "CHICAGO – It’s last minute gift time, and Paramount Pictures has the Anniversary and Special Edition DVD collections that make great stocking stuffers for the cinema buff in your life. The videos below will highlight the titles, either celebrating major anniversaries with deluxe 4K Ultra HD releases, or packages of special release editions.\nLackluster ‘Dog Man’ Barks Up an Unfunny Tree\nPatrickMcDon January 30, 2025 - 9:12am\nRating: 2.0/5.0 |\nCHICAGO – A Big ‘ARF’ of rejection for this animated mutt that fails to fetch many laughs. Source book author Dav Pilkey (“Captain Underpants”) came up with Dog Man while in the second grade, and that’s about the upper age limit of those who may still find these sort of dim-witted antics entertaining.\nAfter a gruesome accident, a cop and his trusty dog are injured and surgeons sew the dog’s head onto the cop’s body. So Dog Man (vocal effects by Peter Hastings) is a crime fighter who loses focus whenever a ball is around and other assorted dog related behaviors. He lives in a dog house and that’s about it. His arch nemesis is Petey the Cat (Pete Davidson) … a megalomaniacal cat out to take over the world with various harebrained contraptions, but is constantly thwarted by Dog Man. The movie is largely based on the first few Dog Man books, but exhausts its source material in about the first 20 minutes. So it’s left to narratively chase its own tale for another hour or so to meet the bare minimum of cinematic running time.\nDog Man\nPhoto credit: Universal Pictures\nThe problem lies in the books and the character of Dog Man himself. Although there have now been more than a dozen books, there’s precious little story in each one. And what’s there is wafer thin, so that doesn’t leave much on which to build the movie. The animated film successfully captures the style of the books, but there’s barely a scoop full of kibble here to sustain it, and the voice cast doesn’t make much of an impact either. In addition to Davidson – whose natural stand up style doesn’t lend itself to cartoon villainy – there’s Isla Fisher as reporter Sarah Hatoff, and Chicago’s own Lil Rel Howery in the stereotypical action movie role of “Angry Police Chief.”\nThe film aims for its Pixar moment when Petey makes a clone of himself, and winds up with an adorable kitten named L’il Petey who’s as sweet as his father is evil. While L’il Petey is the only character in this whole enterprise with a whisker’s worth of emotional depth, Dog Man the movie can’t sniff out a way to make something out of the dynamic.\nNone of this would matter much if it were funny, but it’s not. There are puns galore, including a robot named “80-H-D,” but it doesn’t succeed as a type of Zucker Brothers “Airplane” style joke-a-minute laugh fest, because the jokes come in fits and starts and mostly miss their mark.\n‘Dog Man’ to the Rescue\nPhoto credit: Universal Pictures\nWe’ve grown spoiled by the films of Pixar and Disney, and occasionally Dreamworks, which offer sophisticated storytelling in animated form. So something like this, which resembles a cheap cartoon cash-in feature – although highly polished – from the 1980’s (think “Heathcliff: The Movie”) just doesn’t cut it. When Bill Murray’s “Garfield” movies seem like a laugh riot by comparison, you know there’s trouble.\nBy |",
