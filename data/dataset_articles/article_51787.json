  "text": "Can you afford your next vacation?\nBe honest.\nIf you said no, you’re in good company. Last year’s big travel trend was the “justified vacation” or “justi-vacation,” which is when someone takes a vacation despite being unable to afford it. In a survey conducted by insurance and travel assistance company Allianz Partners, 47 per cent of Americans said they couldn’t afford a vacation, but 49 per cent said they were likely to travel anyway.\nAnother survey by Bankrate found more than 1 in 3 travellers were willing to go into debt to pay for it.\n“Taking on debt to pay for a vacation is not a smart decision,” says Steven Kibbel, a certified financial planner. “Credit card interest rates are high, typically 20 per cent or higher.”\nThat means your dream vacation could cost much more than you bargained for.\nLook, people have been going into debt to finance their vacations since there have been vacations. But now they’ve gone too far. Americans owe more than $1 trillion in credit card deb t , partly driven by a voracious appetite for miles. And many see putting their vacation on plastic as a “win-win” — they get the instant gratification of a trip now, plus “free” miles they can use for a future trip.\nGoing into debt for a vacation is not the best idea. It’ll hurt your finances, stress you out and probably leave you needing another vacation. There are much better ways of dealing with a trip you can’t afford.\n“Never, ever, ever go into debt to travel,” says Suzanne McConaghy, an expert on travel finances. “Make a plan, set a goal, save your money — and then go.”\nOK, but why?\nWhy is going into debt to travel crazy? The allure of a picture-perfect vacation, often fueled by social media, can quickly lead you astray. Admit it, those images of Instagrammers enjoying a five-star resort, paid for entirely with “free” miles, are irresistible.\nIt’s also a lie.\nThere’s no such thing as free . True, travel hackers are racking up points and miles with each debt-funded stay. But they’re also playing a dangerous game. If you don’t pay off your balance in full every month, the interest charges will quickly negate the value of any rewards you earn. It’s a fool’s errand.\n“Taking on any form of debt can significantly increase your stress levels,” says Jeremy Clubb, founder of Rainforest Cruises , a tour operator specialising in riverboat and small ship cruise packages in the Amazon and Southeast Asia. “That often outweighs the relaxation and mental wellness travel is meant to provide.”\nI interviewed dozens of travellers for this story, some of whom insisted that taking on debt to travel was sometimes justified. They said for special occasions or once-in-a-lifetime events like a honeymoon, it is indeed appropriate to go into the red. Some even claimed the points made it all worthwhile.\nTo which I say: nonsense! The more exceptional the occasion, the more financially conservative you ought to be. Who wants to spend the first year of your marriage drowning in debt?\nHow do you afford a vacation, then? I will give it to you straight: Living within your means is the best way to ensure a stress-free vacation.\n“Try being more creative about how you travel,” says Jeremy Murchland, president of Seven Corners Travel Insurance . “For starters, think about why you want to travel. Unless your heart is set on a certain destination, you might find some alternative ways to achieve your vacation goals without setting yourself back.”\nIn other words, plan and explore alternative options that don’t require going into debt.\nI know the travel advisors of the world will hate me for saying this, but maybe consider a staycation, visit local attractions, or take a road trip to a nearby destination.\nBut what if you want to go somewhere pricey?\nMitch Krayton, a professional travel advisor from Denver, says you should save for a big trip.\n“Sweep $100 to $200 a week automatically from your checking into a special savings account,” he advises. “When you are ready to travel, you book with cash in hand. You not only will feel better that you can afford the trip, but you won’t have the letdown a month after you come home to a large bill.”\nDon’t spend more than you have. It’s that simple.\nΜaybe you need a vacation budget. There are two types of travellers: Those who spend as little as possible and those who don’t know the meaning of “budget.”\nIf you’re in the latter group, listen up: One of the best ways to avoid overspending is to create a budget. Apps like TravelSpend or Trabee allow you to visualize your expenses, track them, and plan your trip to avoid spending too much.\nIf you don’t want to use your smartphone on vacation, you can always invite a friend in the former group — those who never spend. (That would be my brother.) They can spend the entire trip telling you, “No.”\nAnd if you are in the former group, this story is not for you. You will never overspend on your vacation. I should have interviewed you for this article.\nOther ways to avoid vacation debt OK, how else can you steer clear of vacation debt? Here are a few ideas:\nTake a staycation. Spend a week exploring your town. You might be surprised at what you discover. “Staycations can sound horrible,” says Sam Hohman, CEO of Credit Advisors Foundation . “But if as much planning goes into them as a destination vacation, they can be really memorable and personally restorative.”\nTravel during the off-season. “Anywhere you desire to see is going to be just as great during its off-season,” says Christopher Falvey, co-founder of Unique NOLA Tours . “But it will be less crowded and less expensive.” So you get the same experience for less — just because you waited a few weeks.\nAbbreviate your vacation. “If all you just need is a break – and who doesn’t? – figure out how you can enjoy time off without it costing you much money,” says Erica Sandberg, a consumer finance expert at CardRates.com. For example, a weekend getaway instead of a two-week adventure may be enough to recharge your batteries. And it’ll save you time, too.\nSo, the next time you’re tempted to book that dream vacation on credit, remember this: A trip paid for with debt is a trip you can’t afford. Instead, focus on saving and planning. You’ll enjoy your vacation more knowing you’re not coming home to a mountain of bills.\nWritten by: Christopher Elliott\nBIO:\nChristopher Elliott is an author, consumer advocate, and journalist.
