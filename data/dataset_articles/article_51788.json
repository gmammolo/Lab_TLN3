  "text": "Utah Hockey Club will not be moving forward with \"Yeti\" or \"Yetis\" as its team nickname and will hold an in-arena fan vote to pick a new one.\nThe team expects to announce a permanent name and identity before the 2025-26 NHL season. The new fan vote comes after the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected names and logos that Utah Hockey Club had submitted for approval, in particular \"Utah Yetis,\" which was widely assumed to be the franchise's eventual nickname.",
