  "text": "Christopher Parr\nChristopher Parr, is the Editor and Chief Content Creator for…\nWhen it comes to luxury cars, there is always a fine balance between exclusivity, performance, and value for money. However, some vehicles lean so heavily toward extravagance that they cross the line into what can only be described as overpriced and overrated.\nOne such car is the Bugatti La Voiture Noire—a vehicle that has been shrouded in mystique since its unveiling. Its name, which translates to “The Black Car”, adds to its aura of exclusivity and elusiveness. But beyond the branding and marketing buzz, does it truly justify its price tag, or is it just an engineering illusion?\nAt The Pursuitist, we’ve analyzed countless luxury vehicles, and few stand out as much as the La Voiture Noire—for all the wrong reasons. Let’s break it down.\nAn Exorbitant Price Tag That Raises Eyebrows\nUnrivaled Cost\nThe Bugatti La Voiture Noire is the world’s most expensive new car, carrying an estimated price tag of $18.7 million, including taxes. This staggering price is more than double that of the previous record-holder, the Rolls-Royce Sweptail ($12.8 million).\nFor context:\n- A Bugatti Chiron, with nearly identical performance specs, costs just $3.3 million.\n- The Pagani Huayra Codalunga, another highly exclusive hypercar, is priced at $7.4 million.\n- Even the Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut, one of the fastest cars in the world, costs around $3.4 million.\nAt this point, one has to ask: Is exclusivity alone worth an additional $15 million?\nLimited Availability\nThe La Voiture Noire was built as a one-off, meaning only a single unit exists. While that certainly increases its rarity, does it justify such an astronomical price?\nOther hypercars, like the Ferrari Monza SP1/SP2 and Lamborghini Veneno, were also produced in limited numbers (less than 20 units each), yet they cost a fraction of La Voiture Noire’s price.\nIn essence, Bugatti is selling a concept, a dream, and a piece of automotive art rather than a car meant for driving. But is that enough?\nPerformance and Specifications: Underwhelming for the Price\nFor an $18.7 million supercar, one would expect groundbreaking performance. However, the La Voiture Noire does not outperform its cheaper counterparts.\nComparable Horsepower\nUnder the hood, the 8.0-liter quad-turbocharged W16 engine produces 1,500 horsepower and 1,180 lb-ft of torque. Impressive? Yes. Unique? Not at all.\n- The Bugatti Chiron has exactly the same engine and power output.\n- The Bugatti Divo, priced at around $6 million, also shares these figures.\n- The Hennessey Venom F5, a $2.1 million hypercar, produces 1,817 horsepower, surpassing the La Voiture Noire.\nAt a price point five to six times higher than other hypercars, shouldn’t it deliver significantly more power?\nUnimpressive Top Speed\nThe La Voiture Noire has a top speed of 261 mph (420 km/h), the same as the Chiron. However:\n- The Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ reaches 304 mph and costs around $3.9 million.\n- The Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut is expected to exceed 330 mph for $3.4 million.\nIn other words, faster and more powerful cars are available for a fraction of the cost.\nFor an $18.7 million price tag, shouldn’t it be the fastest car in the world?\nLuxury and Aesthetics: Is It Just Hype?\nOne-Off Design\nThe La Voiture Noire is inspired by the legendary Bugatti Type 57 SC Atlantic from the 1930s—one of the rarest and most sought-after classic cars. Its design is sleek, sculptural, and undeniably stunning. However, is it revolutionary?\n- Yes: It has a flowing, seamless body with no visible seams, making it appear almost like a single piece of metal.\n- No: It still follows the same general shape and structure as the Chiron. Unlike other special-edition Bugattis like the Divo, which have significantly different aerodynamics, La Voiture Noire is more of a styling exercise than a true engineering marvel.\nInterior: Not That Special\nThe interior, while undoubtedly luxurious, does not significantly differ from other Bugatti models:\n- Premium leather, carbon fiber, and aluminum details? Expected.\n- A high-tech digital instrument cluster and premium sound system? Standard.\n- Any never-before-seen technology? Not really.\nFor a $18.7 million price tag, one would expect some groundbreaking interior features—perhaps a fully customizable digital cockpit, augmented reality windscreen displays, or AI-assisted driving modes. But instead, it’s a slightly refined Chiron interior.\nCost of Ownership: The Hidden Expense\nEven if you can afford to buy La Voiture Noire, can you afford to own it?\n- Maintenance Costs: Bugatti servicing is one of the most expensive in the world. A simple oil change costs around $25,000.\n- Tire Replacement: Special Michelin tires cost $42,000 per set, and Bugatti recommends replacing them every 2,500 miles.\n- Insurance: Expect six-figure premiums annually.\n- Depreciation? Unlike other hypercars, the La Voiture Noire might hold its value due to its one-off status—but that’s still a gamble.\nThe Big Mystery: Who Owns The Bugatti La Voiture Noire?\nSince its unveiling in 2019, rumors have circulated about who purchased the world’s most expensive new car.\nOne of the biggest speculations? Cristiano Ronaldo.\nThe soccer superstar, known for his lavish collection of luxury vehicles, was rumored to have bought the La Voiture Noire as a 35th birthday present to himself for $18.9 million.\nHowever, when asked about the reports, Bugatti’s Communications Manager, Tim Bravo, stated:\n“We don’t comment on rumors, even less when customers are involved. We respect their privacy. It’s on them, not on us, to decide if they want to go public or not. I can’t deny nor confirm the reports.”\nSo, is the “no comment” response an implicit confirmation? The Pursuitist thinks so.\nOther rumored buyers include:\n- Ferdinand Piëch, the late Volkswagen Group Chairman who played a crucial role in Bugatti’s revival.\n- A mystery Middle Eastern billionaire, possibly a member of the Saudi or UAE royal family.\nAs of today, the official owner has never been publicly confirmed.\nFinal Verdict: Is It Worth $18.7 Million?\nThe Bugatti La Voiture Noire is undeniably a work of art—but does that justify the price?\nPros:\n✅ Unparalleled exclusivity (only one in existence)\n✅ A stunning, unique design inspired by the Type 57 SC Atlantic\n✅ A luxurious collector’s item that may appreciate in value\nCons:\n❌ Performance nearly identical to the Chiron, which costs $3.3 million\n❌ Not the fastest, most powerful, or most advanced hypercar available\n❌ Overwhelmingly high ownership and maintenance costs\nAt the end of the day, unless you have an extra $18.7 million to burn, just buy a Bugatti Chiron and save yourself $15 million.\nChristopher Parr\nChristopher Parr, is the Editor and Chief Content Creator for Pursuitist, and a contributing writer to USA Today, Business Insider — and the on-air host of Travel Tuesday on Live at 4 CBS.
