  "text": "Her style in the last several months has left me stone cold, and I think a HUGE part of it is whatever she’s doing with her hair and eyebrows, but there’s also a strange Living Doll thing she seems to play into and I don’t love it. It’s almost like being in arrested development or something. Also, she’s wearing a formal wedding chair cover; she’ll be lucky if someone doesn’t try to hang a coat on her or tuck her under a table.",
