  "text": "Wayne Rooney felt it was necessary to offer some transfer advice to one current Manchester United player.\nDuring his 13-year spell at Manchester United, Wayne Rooney had his fair share of transfer sagas, including a public fall-out with Sir Alex Ferguson.\nRooney was linked with a shock exit in 2010 when he asked Ferguson if he could leave the club. Since hanging up his boots, Rooney revealed that he felt the club was in decline after Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez were sold.\nDespite asking to leave, Rooney ended up staying at United, going on to win a further two Premier League titles and become Manchester United’s all-time top scorer.\nIn March last year, Rooney told TNT Sports that he backed Marcus Rashford to break his United goalscoring record. The 27-year-old now finds himself in a similar situation to Rooney in 2010 with an exit looking likely.\nWayne Rooney urged Marcus Rashford to leave Man United\nBack in May, Rooney wanted Rashford to stay at United but questioned if he would be better off leaving the club.\nHe suggested that Rashford needs to “work harder”, which is the same criticism Ruben Amorim has had since his arrival in Manchester.\nSpeaking on the latest episode of The Overlap, Rooney revealed that he has messaged Rashford privately and urged him to leave United for a fresh start.\n“When this started over two years ago, I was surprised then. Now I’m not. I’ve spoken to Marcus a couple of times and I’ve given him my thoughts and opinions,” Rooney said.\n“I said ‘you need to leave the football club’. Because whatever is going on in his life and at Manchester United, he’s not the same, it’s not him.\n“So I said, for him to have a fresh start he needs to leave the club.”\nRuben Amorim leaves door open for Marcus Rashford to stay\nRashford has been struggling for consistency at United for a few years now, but rumours of an exit ramped up after Amorim dropped Rashford for the Manchester derby and his bombshell interview was released.\nAmorim has repeatedly questioned Rashford’s training, implying that his work ethic around Carrington has slipped well below the Portuguese coach’s high standards.\nRashford remains in talks with Barcelona over a potential exit this month, but if the La Liga giants cannot afford a deal then he may find himself awkwardly staying put in Manchester.\nREAD MORE: ‘We said no…’ Marcus Rashford faces another rejection as club vice-president reveals he was offered to him\nDespite missing 11 consecutive matches for United, Amorim is open to Rashford staying at United – provided he makes changes to his attitude in training.\n“We are a better team with Marcus Rashford,” Amorim said. “That is clear. he is a big talent but, until the right moment, I will not change my mind.”",
