  "text": "DEAR ABBY: I have an old friend who lives an hour from me. I visit her for the day and come home. I have never invited her to spend the night at my home, nor do I expect her to invite me for a sleepover when I drive down to see her.\nThe last two times she has visited me, she has arrived at 9 a.m. I assumed she came early because she wanted to spend the whole day. She expected me to sit and talk all day. She refused to do anything except eat and talk. I am not a sitter, and I hated doing it, but she's a good friend, so I put up with it. Both times, around 5 p.m.,",
