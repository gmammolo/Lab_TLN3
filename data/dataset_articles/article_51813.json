  "text": "Bill Goldberg’s retirement match will happen in WWE at some point in 2025, and he’s busy right now preparing his body for it.\nWhile talking about this subject on his CarCast show, the 58-year-old Goldberg said he’s doing all of this work for just one night. It sounds like his ass is bearing the brunt of the training so far, assuming he is accurate with his use of the word “literally.”\n“Ugh...I’m thinking, I’m doing all of this shit for one night. That’s what I’m thinking. I mean I’m literally busting my ass. I’m up here in the garage, in the gym, every night. Granted, I don’t work out like I used to. It’s a 45 minute Jack LaLanne workout as opposed to the old Goldberg days.”\nBill goes on to say he will use stem cells to repair his old and damaged body.\n“I stretch for like 45 minutes. ‘Cause I remember I used to have to stretch for like 10, but now I got to stretch for an hour and 10 because I’m so ancient. I got to crawl before I run. We all know I got a pretty screwed up shoulder, and that’s my biggest concern getting into this retirement match.\n...It’s all about baby steps. I have a decent amount of time to prep. The reality is [that I am going to] embark upon a journey to try and kick start myself to get in the best shape possible, try to rehab as much as possible, so that I can have a good base to build on. That extremely long dissertation means that I’m going to go get stem cells.”\nGoldberg noted that he hates MRI machines because he’s “claustrophobic as dog shit.” But he had to go take MRIs to see the extent of the damage in his neck, shoulder, and knee. He then admitted that he essentially needs to learn how to use his right arm again.\n“The fact is I’m really trying to retrain myself to use my arm, because the damage that I incurred prohibited me from using it. I stopped using it for a number of years, I really did. I faked it really well, but I stopped using it primarily as my go-to. I did everything left-handed. Fortunately I’m ambidextrous, and so it really didn’t matter, except for the fact that every time that I didn’t use my right arm, the atrophy just set in more and more and more and more.”\nThat may sound bleak, but Goldberg did reveal that he has a lot more movement in his shoulder right now then he did six months ago.\nI’m just reading between the lines here, but it sounds to me like Goldberg’s old, damaged body won’t be ready in time for a match at WrestleMania 41 in April. Perhaps he’ll have his retirement match later this year during one of WWE’s trips to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia?\nAre you optimistic about Bill Goldberg being able to get his ancient body in shape for his retirement match later in 2025?
