  "text": "Local\nAmerican Airlines crash in Washington results in canceled flights to and from RDU\nSeveral flights between Raleigh-Durham International and Reagan Washington National airports were canceled Thursday morning after an Army helicopter collided with an American Airlines plane late Wednesday, sending both into the Potomac River.\nThe airport remained closed Thursday morning, as the search for bodies in the river continued. It is thought that all 64 people on the American flight from Wichita, Kansas, and the three soldiers on the helicopter were killed.\nAmerican Airlines operates several flights between RDU and Reagan Washington National. As of 9 a.m., three American flights from Washington and four departures from RDU had been canceled.\nIn addition, a Delta Air Lines flight from Washington and a Delta departure were also canceled. Late afternoon and evening flights from RDU to Reagan Washington National are still listed as scheduled, but passengers are advised to keep tabs with their airline.\nAmerican and Delta are the only airlines that fly nonstop between Reagan Washington National and RDU. United Airlines flies between the Triangle and Washington Dulles International Airport.\nThis story was originally published January 30, 2025 at 9:30 AM.",
