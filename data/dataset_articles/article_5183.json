  "text": "The Youth Justice Statistics for England and Wales for 2024 to 2025, published today (29 January), show continued success in keeping children out of the justice system, alongside growing pressures that risk undermining progress.\nFewer children than ever before are entering the youth justice system for the first time, and there are record lows in children in custody, reflecting sustained prevention, diversion and community-based responses.\nHowever, for the smaller cohort of children who do enter the system, their experience is becoming slower and more complex. This is intensified by record court delays (from offence to completion), continued high use of remand and persistent racial disparities remain critical challenges.\nThese annual figures provide a comprehensive evidence base to understand how children move through the justice system and can be used to inform joined-up decision making and policy.\nKey findings First-time entrants fell to a record low of 8,100, and the average number of children in custody fell by 3% (from 431 to 418) - the lowest level on record. Prevention and diversion are working, with sustained reductions in arrests, first-time entrants and custodial use, and high levels of no-further-action outcomes following police contact. Court delays reached a record high, with an average of 230 days from offence to completion, delaying support for children and justice for victims. Custodial remand remains over-used, with 62% (around 6 in 10) of children remanded not going on to receive a custodial sentence. Police contact with children continues to fall, with stop and searches down 7% (from around 103,300 to 95,900) and arrests down 2% (from around 59,200 to 58,300). Disproportionality persists, with Black and Mixed ethnicity children remaining over-represented and the proportion of Mixed ethnicity children in custody nearly doubling over the past 10 years (from around 10% to 18%). Reoffending patterns are mixed, with the overall rate falling by 0.7 percentage points (from 32.5% to 31.8%), but the frequency of reoffending rising to a 10-year high (from 4.35 to 4.44 reoffences per child who reoffends). Worrying trends show that knife and offensive weapon offences, including possession, increased by 2% (from around 3,600 to 3,700) and proven sexual offences rising for the third consecutive year (up 6%, from around 1,400 to 1,500). Prevention and diversion continue to reduce justice contact The number of children entering the system for the first time has fallen to a new record low of 8,100. The average number of children in custody also fell by 3% to 418 - the lowest level since records began.\nThis sustained success reflects effective multi-agency working and increased confidence in the use of diversionary approaches. Central to this progress are resources which empower practitioners to steer children towards positive pathways such as the YJB’s Prevention and Diversion Toolkit\nArrests of children decreased by 2% compared with the previous year and children accounted for just 8% of all arrests, challenging perceptions of a “crime wave” by children. Stop and searches of children also fell by 7%, with almost three-quarters resulting in no further action, reinforcing the importance of proportionate responses that avoid unnecessary criminalisation.\nA slower, more punitive experience for children The continued use of custodial remand remains a significant concern. Almost two-thirds (62%) of children remanded to the children’s secure estate did not go on to receive a custodial sentence, meaning many were exposed to the harms of custody unnecessarily. This suggests remand is too often being used to manage system pressures rather than as a last resort.\nCourt delays pose an additional pressure. Despite fewer children entering the system overall, the average time from offence to court completion increased to 230 days – the highest on record. These delays prevent children from accessing timely support, disrupt education and family life, and prolong uncertainty for victims waiting for justice.\nDelays place a significant strain on youth justice services as well as delaying victims from receiving justice. These delays stop children from accessing the right support at the right time which is now becoming a child development issue and not just a system challenge; one made more serious by the number of children who are themselves victims of crime.\nThe YJB will be publishing its Evidence and Insights Pack on Victims in February 2026 which will provide better insights into the link between children as victims and children who offend.\nReoffending reflects unmet need, not rising criminality The overall reoffending rate for children fell by 0.7 percentage points, marking a welcome reduction. However, the frequency of reoffending increased to a 10-year high, indicating that while fewer children are reoffending, those who do often have significant unmet and complex needs.\nThis underlines the importance of sustained investment in trauma-informed and targeted support to address the underlying drivers of repeat offending and achieve lasting reductions in harm.\nDisproportionality remains unacceptable While there have been encouraging reductions in the number and proportion of Black children at some stages of the system, Black and Mixed ethnicity children remain over-represented in youth justice. Of particular concern is the proportion of children in custody who are of Mixed ethnicity, which has nearly doubled over the past 10 years.\nThe Youth Justice Board continues to prioritise action to tackle ethnic disproportionality through system-wide reform and community-based alternatives, including the Addressing Ethnic Disparity Pathfinder in the West Midlands and the London Accommodation Pathfinder, which supports Black and Mixed heritage boys who would otherwise be remanded to custody.\nWe are also going to publish an additional insights report on disproportionality in February, which will serve as a ‘deep dive’ and set out the evidence of what works to tackle persistent disparities.\nStephanie Roberts-Bibby, Chief Executive of the Youth Justice Board, says:\n“This report proves that when we prioritise prevention, it works. Seeing child first-time entrants and custodial numbers at record lows is a testament to the dedication of youth justice workers and their local partners.\n“However, we cannot be complacent while the ‘machinery’ of justice slows down. A 230-day wait for court completion is unacceptable. It stalls rehabilitation and denies victim’s closure. The system must address these delays with urgency.\n“Sadly, these statistics also show that the youth justice system is still not equitable for all children. To remedy this, partnership working must be strengthened at a local, regional and national level.\n“Success relies on prevention, but this area is fragile and risks being undermined by delays in the system, remand practice and system capacity pressures. We continue to advocate for community-based outcomes and prioritising early intervention over formal justice contact, to create safer communities with fewer victims.”\nEnds\nNotes to editors – links to various products Access the Youth justice statistics: 2024 to 2025 - GOV.UK These statistics look at data for the youth justice system in England and Wales for the year ending March 2025 (where available). The publication considers the number of children (those aged 10 to 17) in the system, the offences they committed, the outcomes they received, their demographics and the trends over time. Youth Custody Statistics also incorporate young adults who have remained in the youth estate, In addition to the report, there is a summary infographic which highlights the main findings. This release includes dashboards showing local level data. The YJB does not comment on regional data or localised themes as often there are contexts specific to areas and communities which provide more valuable insight into local youth justice. The relevant local authority would be best placed to respond to requests for comment.
