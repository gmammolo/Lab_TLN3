  "text": "I will be the first to admit, I am not a fan of flying. It doesn't matter that I love traveling. It doesn't matter that I have flown more times than I can count, it is not an enjoyable experience for me. The planes are always over crowded, there is always at least one annoying passenger, and I get claustrophobic in the tight spaces. Let's not even begin to discuss turbulence or cabin pressure. However, this plane story is both humorous and annoying. One person decides to sit in the wrong seat on the plane and causes a huge domino effect when polite passengers refuse to address the issue. Then, this results in a huge delay...talk about starting your vacation off in the wrong way.\nPolite Passengers Cause Huge Delay Over Wrong Seat\nLook, I get it. Sometimes, mistakes are made. After all, the seats can be confusing to figure out sometimes. Especially if you are in a rush to board. However, there are also people out there who take full advantage of this situation by buying cheaper seats and then just selecting the one they want when they board the aircraft. Let's just say these passengers were nicer than me. If I paid for a seat, I am sitting in that seat....end of story.\nPEOPLE Magazine shares details from the entire airline debacle. Apparently, a passenger boarded the plane and chose to ignore her ticket and assigned seat. A fellow passenger shared, \"She was supposed to be in 30B, a middle seat, but decided to sit in the window seat, 37F.\" While I will admit that it is strange that she chose to sit further back, opting for a window over a middle seat is pretty common.\nRather than address the issue, the person who was supposed to sit in 37F chose not to confront her. Instead, they just found another seat. Apparently this plane was full of polite passengers who did not like confrontation. One after the other, they all chose to avoid conflict and just found themselves another seat, despite it being the wrong seat.\nFlight Attendants Get Involved\nEventually it got to the point where flight attendants had to get involved. After all, with over half of the plane in the wrong seat someone was bound to notice something. No matter how polite the passengers were. PEOPLE shared, \"Once the crew clocked the conundrum, they traced the flyers' boarding passes from wrong seat to wrong seat until they found the instigator.\" You can imagine the huge delay that this caused, to have to go through the seats one by one.\nWhen the instigator was finally found, she pleaded ignorance. Honestly, a smart move considering the entire plane was probably furious at her over the huge delay her shenanigans caused. I am not the only one who thinks this woman was lying through her teeth. Commenters on the Reddit post shared their personal opinions and stories of similar situations.\nOne user wrote, \"These people know what they are doing.\"\nAnother added their two cents. \"The other problem was the original 37F - should have call the other passenger out, because by being non-confrontational they then took someone else's seat, they were part of the problem.\"\nA third chimed in, \"I saw this happen where a wife and husband switched seats with a guy to sit together (both middle seats, so shouldn't have been an issue), but they were all in the wrong seats to begin with. Caused a huge delay on an already delayed flight.\"",
