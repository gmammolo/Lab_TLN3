  "text": "The Worst-Dressed Celebs At Paris Haute Couture Week Spring/Summer 2025\nMaybe we're biased, but it felt like our favorite celebs put on a particularly good show at Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2025. Pamela Anderson continued exploring her recent jaunt into refreshing minimalist fashion, Megan Thee Stallion was a tangerine dream at the Giambattista Valli show and some kind of primal goddess at the Gaurav Gupta show, and we were all in raptures as we took more dark and dangerous steps into Jenna Ortega's stunning style evolution, with the \"Wednesday\" star's all-black ensemble being drop-dead gorgeous.\nThe list goes on, and with so many knockout 'fits, a best-dressed list would be almost impossible to nail down. But where there are style successes, there are inevitably a few style failures. With the fashion week bar set so high, a few stars stood out for their lack of imagination or disjointed styling. From Venus Williams' unbalanced attempt at elevated streetwear to Kylie Jenner's snooze-worthy Blair Waldorf cosplay, some celebrity guests simply fell a little short.\nKarlie Kloss' skirt suit was sharp but unmemorable\nIconic model and former Victoria's Secret angel Karlie Kloss knows how to work her angles, so it's no surprise that she looked sleek in her tailored suit at the Christian Dior show during Paris Haute Couture Week Spring/Summer 2025. Unfortunately for Kloss, however, other attendees turned the volume up to 11 with reimagined pieces, which left her too-classic look lagging behind. Beyond its impeccable fit, the ensemble offered no standout details, ultimately making Kloss' suit a forgettable addition to this fashion week's parade of styles. Sadly, this isn't the first time the model has disappointed: In 2019, Kloss' underwhelming puff-sleeved minidress landed her among the worst outfits in Met Gala history.\nVenus Williams' styling let down her cool jumpsuit\nIt deeply pains us to include a GOAT like Venus Williams on this list, but something about the silhouette of her fashion-week 'fit just didn't work for the tennis star. Though we loved the subtle, monochromatic combination of streetwear with chic accessories, Williams' slouchy jumpsuit was paired with an equally slouchy jacket, which seemed to shorten the usually leggy athlete. This look might have been saved with a higher hairdo to draw the eye upward, but as it stood, the styling on this day did Williams no justice.\nKylie Jenner's co-ords were more of the same\nAttending the Chanel show at Paris Haute Couture Week on January 28, Kylie Jenner wore a white tweed set that could have come straight out of \"Gossip Girl.\" And while tweed had a stealth-wealth moment in fall 2023, it's starting to feel a little tired by now. We get that Jenner was trying to rep Chanel during the show, but she could have created more interest by mixing and matching the pieces instead of wearing the full set. Jenner isn't afraid to push fashion boundaries, so it would have been nice to see something new or fresh for this fashion week. For instance, while it was an overall simpler look, we much preferred the double-lapeled leather jacket her sister Kendall wore to the Schiaparelli show the day prior.\nLily-Rose Depp's take on tweed was both busy and dull\nAs the child of A-list actor Johnny Depp and model Vanessa Paradis, Lily-Rose Depp comes from a strong fashion background. However, her outfit at Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2025 fell flat. Not to hate on tweed, especially at a Chanel show, but it felt like Lily-Rose fell prey to the same weight of expectation that led Kylie Jenner to pick such an expected outfit. At least Lily-Rose tried to spice things up with black, feathered trim and the addition of beetle brooches on the skirt, but ultimately, the garments looked busy and fought with each other. It didn't help that her mom was wearing an intriguing feather jacket, which effortlessly outshone Lily-Rose's staid separates.\nRaffey Cassidy's goth-adjacent outfit had too many ideas\nDon't come at us, Dior stans, but we can't get behind \"Tomorrowland\" actor Raffey Cassidy's look from the fashion house. The silhouette was cute and innovative, the accessorizing was satisfying, and the hidden shorts were a delight. But try as we might, we can't look at the patched and riveted top without feeling transported to Hot Topic circa 2005. This referential, pseudo-goth aesthetic cheapens the vibe of Cassidy's outfit. If only it had been kept simple in solid black without all the unnecessary embellishments.\nJeanne Damas' sleeves spoiled her whole look\nAs a designer and model herself, we'd have hoped that Jeanne Damas — founder of the French fashion label Rouje — would have picked a more suitable silhouette. Her look was certainly headed in the right direction with the coat's luxe charcoal palette and the matching, frankly adorable shoes, but we can't get past the dreadful fit on Damas' sleeves. Playing with proportion is one thing, but that amorphous shape and too-short cuff make Damas look broader and shorter than she really is, which is a crime against her natural beauty.\nLourdes Leon's near-nudity was all shock and no awe\nPlaying it safe was the biggest sartorial sin at Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2025. However, there were also a few big swings that ended up missing the mark — such as Lourdes Leon's barely there bodysuit. The singer and model, who happens to be Madonna's daughter, arrived at Saint Laurent's menswear show in sheer, strapless lace under an open black, leather jacket. The ensemble left her black undies and lack of bra totally visible, and while it was certainly a bold move, Leon's look delivered more shock value than élan. Madonna's kids may all have their own unique sense of style, but we'd send Leon back to the drawing board after this outing.",
