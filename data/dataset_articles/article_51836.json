  "text": "6 hours ago\nI bought two wired smoke alarms/CO2 detectors and installed one successfully. After a couple weeks delay (don't ask) I prepared to install the second one. I couldn't remember which side of the backplate faced the wall, so, like a nincompoop I popped it on the back of the unit.\nAnd now can't remove it to install on the wall.\nAny secret release or do I destroy it and order a new backplate. And if so, from where can they be ordered?\nThe good news is I now know which side faces out\nThanks for any help you can offer",
