  "text": "This periodic column rounds up restaurant closures in and around Philadelphia. Catch up on more news about closures in the Philly area right here. If there’s a closing in your neighborhood that we’ve missed, let us know at philly@eater.com.\nArctic Scoop\nAfter six years of service, the ice cream shop known for its bubble waffles and pan-Asian flavors (such as red bean, taro, lychee, Thai tea, Vietnamese coffee) closed on Monday, December 30, 2024. No explicit reason was given for the shutter on the Instagram announcement post by owners Chris Cheang and Alex Wu. 1812 East Passyunk Avenue, Wharton\nBomb Bomb Bar-B-Q Grill\nThe longtime barbecue and Italian restaurant closed on Saturday, December 28, 2024, because its owners, Frank Barbato Junior and Deb Barbato, have retired. The family-run restaurant opened in 1951 by Frank’s father and mother, Frank Senior and Jeanie, who took over what had been Jimmy’s Tavern. 1026 Wolf Street, South Philly\nGrace Tavern\nThe 20-year-old pub closed on Sunday, January 12, with no reason given for the shutter. It was known for its late-night hours, burgers, beers, and friendly atmosphere. 2229 Grays Ferry Avenue, Southwest Center City\nHawthornes Cafe + Bar\nThe 15-year-old all-day restaurant, bar, and beer/wine bottle shop closed on Sunday, January 5. Co-owners Chris Fetfatzes and Heather Annechiarico shared on Instagram that they’d like to reopen the restaurant eventually. But until then, Philly Voice reports that the duo just reopened one of their closed bars, Sunny’s Cocktail Joint, and is working on reopening Wine Dive (both places shuttered in 2022 because of fire damages). 738 South 11th Street, Bella Vista\nUltimo Coffee Roasters in Rittenhouse Square\nThe unionized Rittenhouse location of the coffee shop mini-chain closed on Wednesday, January 22. Co-owners Aaron and Elizabeth Ultimo said it was because of plumbing issues dating back to February 2024, as reported by Philadelphia Inquirer. Since that time, the location had to periodically temporarily close, which impacted its staff. The team at this address was in the middle of a three-year union contract, organized under Local 80. Ultimo’s three other locations remain open; the South Philadelphia one is a union one. 238 South 20th Street, Rittenhouse Square\nWinnie’s Manayunk\nThe 22-year-old restaurant closed sometime in mid-January, as reported by Philadelphia Inquirer. The shutter was awash in swirls of controversy involving staffers’ bounced paychecks and the sudden firing of staff. 4266 Main Street, Manayunk",
