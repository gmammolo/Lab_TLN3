  "text": "I lived out my ultimate driving nightmare on this New Jersey road Kylie Moore Kylie Moore Published: January 30, 2025 Canva / TSM Illustration There’s plenty to be nervous about when driving on New Jersey roads, but this week I experienced one I have always been especially afraid of.\nI was driving home from work on Wednesday night on Route 295. For context, it was around 7:10, so it was pretty dark.\nCanva / TSM Illustration Canva / TSM Illustration loading... I was in the middle lane with a truck decently far in front of me in the right lane, and a car in the left lane ahead of me but not as much as the truck.\nTSM Illustration TSM Illustration loading... I suddenly saw something bouncing across the road, coming from the right and quickly approaching where the left-lane car was going to be.\nAt first, I thought it was a small animal running across the highway, but I quickly realized that it was a tire that came off of the truck.\nCanva / TSM Illustration Canva / TSM Illustration loading... Thankfully, the left-lane car narrowly missed any impact and the tire bounced into the median while the truck pulled over to the side of the road.\nPerhaps it’s because I have seen Final Destination 2 more times than anyone should, but driving while a large object flies off another vehicle has long been a fear of mine.\nCanva / TSM Illustration Canva / TSM Illustration loading... For those who haven’t seen the 2003 film, the opening scene has logs falling off of a truck, causing mayhem and death, to put it lightly. It’s not a good movie, but it’s fun. I legitimately believe it’s more influential than The Godfather.\nLuckily everyone seemed to be okay, I hope the truck driver was able to get back on the road safely. It could have been a lot worse considering how difficult it was to see the tire in the dark.\nDrive safe out there, New Jersey!\nLOOK: Here are the states where you are most likely to hit an animal Hitting an animal while driving is a frightening experience, and this list ranks all 50 states in order of the likelihood of such incidents happening, in addition to providing tips on how to avoid them.
