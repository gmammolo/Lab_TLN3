  "text": "For years, Matt James and Rachael Kirkconnell were one of The Bachelor ‘s most talked-about couples. Despite a rocky start due to past controversies, they managed to stay together and build a relationship that lasted four years, which is a rare feat for a reality TV romance.\nFans followed their journey as they traveled the world, shared their love for food, and seemingly enjoyed a picture-perfect life. But all of that came crashing down when James suddenly announced their breakup on Instagram just two weeks ago.\nMatt James and Rachael Kirkconnell in the show The Bachelor | Credit: ABC The news left many stunned, especially since there were no prior signs of trouble. What made things even more shocking was Kirkconnell’s reaction. She admitted that she was just as blindsided as everyone else, revealing that they had even been planning their future together before everything fell apart. So, what went wrong?\nRachael Kirkconnell revealed the reason behind the breakup Rachael Kirkconnell on Call Her Daddy podcast | Credit: YouTube\\Call Her Daddy Every relationship has its ups and downs, and Matt James and Kirkconnell were no exception. However, their final moments as a couple took an unexpectedly harsh turn. Kirkconnell recently opened up about their split on the Call Her Daddy podcast, where she gave an emotional and detailed account of what led to the breakup.\nAccording to her, the end came suddenly while they were in Tokyo. They had been traveling together, creating content, and indulging in their shared love for food. But on their last night there, things took an unexpected turn. Kirkconnell had been feeling overwhelmed, trying to pick the perfect restaurant for dinner, knowing how important food content was to James.\nShe said on the Call Her Daddy podcast ,\nI was trying so hard to find, like, a good dinner spot for us. I was putting so much pressure on finding a good spot because he cares. This is, like, his career, you know, going to good food spots … Literally every single meal that we would have, we were filming.\nUnfortunately, the spot she chose didn’t meet their expectations, which made her upset. The pressure of making sure every meal was “ content-worthy ” had become too much. What was meant to be an enjoyable dinner turned into a tense moment.\nShe further said,\nThis sounds crazy, but as a food person, I’m trying to make sure that he’s getting good content for our trip and stuff, because I know it’s important to him, and it’s something that we’ll both post about.\nMatt James and Rachael Kirkconnell | Credit: Instagram\\@rachaelkirkconnell Kirkconnell got a little teary during dinner, which made James wonder why she was so emotional. But for her, everything seemed fine, at least on the surface. Deep down, though, their relationship was reaching its breaking point. She needed answers, asking if he truly saw a future with her or if he was just scared.\nWas she the one, or was he holding out for someone else? In the end, James admitted he didn’t think she was the right person for him. He didn’t want to keep her waiting for something that might never happen, so they went their separate ways.\nRelated ‘Bachelor’ Star Rachael Kirkconnell’s Jaw-Dropping Racism Controversy Revisited Amid Shocking Matt James Breakup James shocked her with words she never expected to hear. Instead of reassuring her or discussing their issues, he told her that he couldn’t see himself proposing or getting married to her. Kirkconnell recalled what James said,\nHe said that… there were just qualities about me that he worries about having in a wife . I don’t know if I ever see myself proposing to you. I can’t actually see myself married to you.\nTheir four-year relationship came to an abrupt end. To make matters worse, he publicly announced the breakup on Instagram before she even had the chance to process what had happened or inform her loved ones. It was a tough pill to swallow, and Kirkconnell was left heartbroken.\nRachael Kirkconnell and Matt James were discussing getting engaged before the unfortunate break-up Matt James and Rachael Kirkconnell | Credit: Instagram\\@mattjames919 What makes this breakup even more heartbreaking is that James and Kirkconnell had been seriously talking about getting engaged before everything fell apart. In fact, Kirkconnell revealed that James had encouraged her to start looking at rings and considering their future together. This was a big deal for him, as he had always been hesitant about commitment.\nKirkconnell said in the interview (via Call Her Daddy podcast ),\nWe talked about rings. He told me a few months ago to start, you know, saving some things, picking things out or that we should go look at some—and that was a big deal, I would say, for him to say. That’s when I was like, ‘Wow, okay. He really is on board with this.’\nShe further said,\nThat was such a green flag to me and I felt like the longer we were together, the more he was able to talk about it and I think at first, I could tell it was something that did scare him a lot or it was like a really hard thing for him to talk about and it just seemed easier and easier as our relationship went on, so I felt like that was a good sign.\nKirkconnell believed that with time, James was becoming more open to the idea of marriage. The way he spoke about their future gave her hope that they were on the same page. She had no reason to doubt his intentions, especially since they had been discussing engagement and even potential family plans. Everything seemed to be falling into place, making the sudden breakup even more confusing and painful.\nRelated The Bachelor: The Advice Survivor’s Jeff Probst Gave to Chris Harrison May Have Saved His Career as Host Unfortunately, life doesn’t always go as planned. The love story that once fans adored ended on a sour note, leaving Kirkconnell to pick up the pieces. Kirkconnell’s side of the story paints a picture of heartbreak, disappointment, and a relationship that ended faster than anyone expected.\nBreakups are never easy, and this one was particularly rough. Here’s hoping Kirkconnell finds happiness, whether it’s with someone new or simply by enjoying life without the pressure of turning every moment into content. One thing’s for sure, she deserves someone who values her beyond just the perfect Instagram-worthy meal.",
