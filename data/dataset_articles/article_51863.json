The season ended on a cliffhanger, leaving fans clamoring for the next one as soon as possible.\nWhile many fans have thought they figured out the final season's premiere or character clues, Netflix finally confirmed the season premiere date on Thursday. The show's account on X, formally known as Twitter , shared a promotional photo for the third season, displaying one of the show's black coffins with a pink bow around it.\nIn front of it a Squid Game worker dressed in the traditional pink outfit drags a Squid Game player in his green tracksuit towards the coffin. At the bottom of the poster, it read: \"Prepare for the final game.\"\nNetflix announced when the last season will air ( Image: Netflix) A first look was also released ( Image: Netflix) The show's X account captioned the post: \"Nothing can prepare you for the final season. Squid Game Season 3 premieres June 27. #NextOnNetflix.\"\nMany fans on the social media site shared their disappointment about the announcement, but for varying reasons. Some fans were sad the iconic show was ending, with one writing: \"June is far and please let this not be the finals. Series is too good to stop at season 3.\"\n\"It’s a show that deserves multiple years,\" another wrote, \"I’m sad that it’s ending after only 3 seasons.\" A third added: \"we will be seated.\"\nOthers were disappointed because many didn't enjoy the short seven episode second series. \"This is not season 3 this is season 2 part 2. You cannot call The 7 episodes dropped a season,\" one person complained.\n\"For starters we haven’t learned anything of substance, everyone knew In Ho was the front man and the episode 7 reveal took way too long, everyone was waiting for it,\" they continued, \"There also was no substantial cliffhanger at the end in either the game or on the boat, episode 7 should’ve been episode 5 and the final 2 episodes could’ve been 90 minutes like stranger things did and we could’ve wrapped on 2 strong final episodes.\"\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\nSign up to our FREE newsletter and get the top stories to your inbox DAILY NEWSLETTER: Sign up here to get the latest news and updates from the Mirror US straight to your inbox with our FREE newsletter.\nTop Stories Don't Miss Follow The Mirror US MORE ON Netflix\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
