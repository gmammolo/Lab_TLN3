  "text": "Netflix fans have been left disappointed after it emerged that one of the most popular series ever is set to leave the platform in two years' time.\nBreaking Bad, which first aired in 2008, has won a total of 16 Emmy Awards, including four Best Actor Emmys for star Bryan Cranston. In its five seasons, the show follows the story of Walter White, a terminally ill chemistry teacher who teams with a former student to manufacture crystal meth to secure his family's future.\nOther stars on the show are Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman), Bob Odenkirk (Saul Goodman) and Anna Gunn, who plays Walter's wife, Skyler White. All seasons of the series are now available on Netflix, but they will be exiting on April 18, 2027.\nPreviously, Breaking Bad was set to depart the streaming platform this year, but its license was extended for two more years following an agreement Sony Pictures Television. After it emerged that fans have just two more years to enjoy the show on Netflix, many have taken to social media to share their frustration.\nOne wrote on X, formerly called Twitter, \"This show should literally never leave Netflix. I just finished rewatching it again yesterday.\" Another said, \"Ok so I still have 2 more years to watch it 100 more times.\"\nA third agreed, \"They just raised the price & now they are taking away one of the best shows? That's so messed up!\" A fourth pointed out, \"Funny how Netflix announces a price increase one day, followed by one of the most popular shows that's on the platform being removed (I get it's not for 2 years, but the point still stands) the next.\"\nOne more fan wrote, \"Netflix is removing shows they never removed before.\" It comes days after Netflix announced it is increasing prices, with many disappointed fans threatening to cancel their subscription. The latest price hike comes on the heels of the streaming service reporting a record increase in subscriber numbers, boasting 19 million new subscribers in the last quarter of 2024.\nNetflix's ad-supported plan will be going from $6.99 to $7.99, its standard plan will increase from $15.49 to $17.99, and its premium plan will be raised from $22.99 to $24.99. Netflix has decided to increase monthly subscription costs despite the massive success of season 2 of Squid Game and NFL Christmas Day featuring Beyoncé, which saw record-breaking numbers for a live event with over 30 million viewers tuning in.\nSubscribers took to X, formerly Twitter, to complain about the price hike, with many vowing to cancel their subscription. Some viewers pointed out the irony in the fact that streaming services rose in popularity due to rising cable costs only to end up costing more than cable. One user wrote: \"Streaming will cost more than cable very soon. These prices are out of control.\"\nThe streaming service saw an annual operating income of over $10 billion, with its annual revenue increasing by 16%, according to the New York Times. With such success, streamers are chalking up the price hike to greed, with one X user saying: \"Lmao @netflix raising subscription prices because of an influx of new subscribers is the biggest greed move yet. You’re already gaining new profits…?\"\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\nSign up to our FREE newsletter and get the top stories to your inbox\nDAILY NEWSLETTER: Sign up here to get the latest news and updates from the Mirror US straight to your inbox with our FREE newsletter.",
