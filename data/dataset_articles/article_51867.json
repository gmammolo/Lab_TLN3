You may even combine multiple airlines or different modes of transportation to get to your destination.”\nRead Next: 10 Best Money-Saving Travel Apps To Download in 2025\nZach also said that the more flexible you are, the better deals you can snag.\n“According to industry insights, Sundays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are typically the best days to book flights, as that saves you about 5-10% on domestic flights and up to 15% on international flights compared to other days of the week,” she explained. “Sunday, however, is not the best day for flying, as lots of people are aiming to fly out or go back home for the start of the week. And with increased ticket purchases and flights happening on Fridays, it is considered the worst day for booking flights.\n“Remember that early-morning or late-night flights may also be more affordable, as those are less convenient for most air travelers .”\nAdditional Fees Can Apply for Selected Seating “In addition,” said Zach, “last-minute flight bookings often leave passengers with fewer available seating options, which can lead to additional fees for selected seating.”\nZach recommends opting for a seat with no additional charges to avoid those fees. Lifehacker notes that it’s not obvious to consumers that they don’t have to pay a seat selection fee when booking, but it is possible, according to USA Today . Simply skip the seat selection screen and the airline will assign you a seat.\nChecked Bag and Carry-On Fees Are More Expensive Zach said that checked bag and carry-on luggage fees also become more expensive closer to the departure date.\n“It’s worth keeping in mind that these fees are even higher if you pay for your checked luggage at the airport check-in desk ,” she added.\nZach recommended packing light and only traveling with a carry-on bag to avoid checked baggage fees .\n“Some airlines do offer bundled deals that include seat selection and baggage fees at a discounted rate when booked at the last minute, but I wouldn’t rely on that,” she said. “And if you’re a frequent flyer, you can also consider using your miles and credit card points to cover some of the additional last-minute booking fees.\n“Many air carriers also have rewards programs and limited-time member promotions that offer discounted fares, upgrades and other in-flight perks.”\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : 3 Hidden Costs of Booking Flights Last Minute — And How To Avoid Them",
