  "text": "Ariana Grande's notorious doppelgänger Paige Niemann has this week gone viral for 'impersonating' the star at a red carpet movie premiere, prompting fans of the real Wicked actress to wonder how she must be feeling about it.\nGrande has addressed her resemblance to the controversial social media 'cosplayer' several times publicly since the image-mirroring began - including on one brutal occasion, where she supposedly slammed Niemann as 'bizarre'.\nWho is Paige Niemann?\nThe Mail previously reported that, when California schoolgirl Paige Niemann was just 10 years old, a friend noted her physical similarities to then-Disney Channel star, Ariana Grande - who is around 11 years older.\nAdvert\nIn the years prior, the actress was famed for portraying red-haired class clown Cat Valentine on Nickelodeon hits like Victorious and Sam & Cat, before launching a successful career as a pop singer.\nAgreeing with the resemblance, Niemann then tried her hand at purposefully dressing up as Grande, with her first Instagram post - uploaded in 2017 - showing her donning a similar hot-red wig to the one worn on kids TV by the actress.\nThe years that followed saw Niemann copy the several changes that Grande made to her appearance - from her lengthy brunette ponytail and winged eyeliner phase of 2018-20, to the more minimal blonde get-up she's been donning more recently.\nAnd after Wicked was released in cinemas in November of last year, the lookalike - who had since racked up a staggering 10.3 million fans on TikTok - went viral for recreating her performing as her character 'Glinda' in 'What Is This Feeling?', complete with pink dress and blonde wig.\nControversial copying\nDespite her mighty online following, however, Niemann's fame hasn't come without its controversies.\nAdvert\n2022 saw her subjected to mass backlash after reportedly signing up to the online subscription service OnlyFans - which is known for hosting explicit material - where she vowed to share 'exclusive content that you wouldn't normally see from me'.\nThe move raised questions of permission and consent on the part of the real 'Thank U Next' singer, with critics later branding Niemann 'weird', 'desperate' and 'creepy' on X.\nAnd this week, Niemann's impersonating antics were seemingly raised to a whole new level after she made what she described online as her 'first red carpet appearance' on Monday (27 January), by the attending the movie premiere for Companion in Hollywood, dressed as Grande.\n\"I thought it’s a Madame Tussaud wax figure at first,\" one critic later slammed online, whilst another agreed: \"Yeah I’m terrified too.\"\nAdvert\nBut how must the real Ariana Grande feel to know that she's having her entire aesthetic ripped off in public without her consent?\nAriana Grande's take\nWhilst she's never explicitly hit out at Niemann's antics by using her name, she has taken a passionate stance against celebrities being impersonated on several occasions now.\nAdvert\nAccording to Buzzfeed in 2019, the actress and musician, now 31, responded on X to a fans' theory about Niemann's rise to prominence, writing: \"@knnewagb i just wonder whyyyy the cat voice / dialogue.\"\nGrande is said to have continued: \"i am sure she is the sweetest sweet sweetheart forreal !! but it’s definitley bizarre seeing people blend the two worlds lmao.\"\nThe news outlet also alleges that, on another occasion, Grande shared a now-deleted video of another internet user discussing the concept of impersonation online.\nThe video in question supposedly saw filmmaker Jordan Firstman explaining: \"What if we, like, we took a moment, like a small clip from a movie or a TV show — something that, like, an artist really poured their soul into and it, like, it just took them years to make, and it was an uphill battle the entire time — what if we took a moment from that and we kind of, like, recontextualised it?\nAdvert\n\"Like, does that make sense? And we put a completely arbitrary meaning onto that thing that the artist loves so much? Kind of, like, degrading its entire value?\"\nFirstman added: \"I just think that could be, like, a fun, bitchy thing to do,\" he ends the video. \"I'm so bored... I just kind of wanna ruin someone's life today.\"\nApparently, Grande re-shared the clip with her own caption, writing: \"Can this please also double as your impression of the pony tail TikTok girls who think doing the Cat Valentine voice and that wearing winged eyeliner and a sweatshirt is doing a good impersonation of me...\n\"Cause this is really how it feels.\"\nAnd in a promo interview for Wicked with Variety more recently - where she was hooked up to a lie detecter and asked by co-star Cynthia Erivo whether she'd 'ever confronted' anyone who impersonated her - she began by claiming, 'No'.\nThen, asked if she 'wanted to' - in a video which many fans interpreted as being about Niemann - Grande admitted: \"Yes - in a fun way.\"",
