  "text": "It’s the third consecutive day that I’m writing about another game’s EOS. It’s KonoSuba: Fantastic Days Global which has officially wrapped up. Today, 30th January, is the game’s official last day. The servers are gearing up for a shutdown. So, what’s next?\nHow Long Did This One Last?\nDeveloped by Sumzap, the game was originally published by Nexon before being handed over to Sesisoft. It was a good game. That being said, I also have to acknowledge the fact that the fantastic days of KonoSuba was pretty short-lived.\nKonoSuba: Fantastic Days Global servers made it 3.5 years, while Japan pushed through for a solid 5 years. For an anime-based gacha game, that’s actually a respectable run, especially since revenue had been dipping for a while.\nThe devs have clearly moved on, putting their focus on the JJK gacha game (Jujutsu Kaisen Phantom Parade). Before shutting the game down, they kept things going until the very end, with voiced story updates and even a final song release just three weeks ago.\nThey also held a farewell livestream in December, featuring none other than Kazuma’s voice actor. The Japanese version even went a step further by archiving the entire main story on their YouTube channel.\nSo, players can revisit all the absurdity of Kazuma and his dysfunctional crew whenever they want. They also got an offline version where players can still access the game’s story, voicelines and character collection.\nUnfortunately, KonoSuba: Fantastic Days Global doesn’t have any offline version coming up nor a dedicated YouTube channel. But you can still check out the Japanese YouTube channel in case you want to spend more time with Kazuma, Aqua, Megumin and everyone else.\nSo, that wraps up our scoop on the KonoSuba: Fantastic Days Global shutdown. Meanwhile, you can read our next news on Karrablast and Shelmet in the February Community Day of Pokémon Go.",
