The Tigers fell to 12-3.\n“This was a very good basketball game from start to finish. After we got an early lead, Pequot Lakes went to zone and the game was within a couple of possessions the rest of the way,” said Nevis head coach Scott Kramer. “We had chances to escape with the win, but we didn’t convert on a few plays and they were able to get to the free throw line late in the game. It was really good for us to have to compete on each possession down the stretch. It will make us better down the stretch and during tournament time.”\nNEVIS: D. Lindow 2, I.
