Bonfire had occupied the East Carson Street space for the past six years.\n\"After the unexpected passing of my father this past year, I’ve spent the last several months reevaluating the time, energy, and schedule that being the chef/owner of an independent restaurant requires,\" Bonfili said in a Facebook post.\nFind out what's happening in Pittsburghfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\n\"Although my passion for the business still runs deep, my commitment and desire to live the chef life has waned. With my children in high school and middle school, I’m looking forward to focusing on my family and living more of the dad life for this next chapter.\"\nBonsili did not offer a specific closure date, saying \"We still have a little time before the fire goes out for good.\" The restaurant's hours will be changing in its final days; the revised hours will be posted on social media.\nFind out what's happening in Pittsburghfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.\nSign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.",
