I didn’t ask for a side of this @Burger King.[#ohio][#sideorder][#tiktokmademebuyit][♬ original sound - JannaBama]\nWhile Baker joked about Burger King suddenly selling broccoli, she was not impressed to find marijuana in her daughter's meal.\nLOOK: Optical illusion picture leaves people confused\nShe reached out to the drive-thru, and the manager on duty assured her that the general manager would be in touch first thing the following morning.\nSince Baker shared the video, Burger King has issued an official statement to WTAE news.\nWe contacted the Franchisee of this restaurant immediately upon learning of this incident and can confirm that the employee in question has been terminated. We were very disappointed to learn of the incident and do not take incidents that put our guests in danger lightly.- Burger King spokesperson\nWhile it is legal to possess weed if you're 21 or older in Ohio, it hasn't been fully decriminalised yet.\nThere's no doubt that accidentally finding yourself in possession of drugs can be terrifying and stressful.\nTune in to 'The Drive with Rob & Roz', on weekdays from 16:00 – 19:00.
