  "text": "Carl Alfred Garber, Jr., went to his heavenly home at the age of 95 on Monday, January 27, 2025. Carl passed away from this world at home surrounded by his daughter, Gail Garber, and his granddaughter, Danielle Garber. Carl was born at home in Kosciusko County, Indiana on December 19, 1929, to Carl Alfred Garber, Sr., and Dessie (Mellott) Garber. He grew up in South Bend, Indiana and graduated from Riley High School in 1948.\nCarl also known as Dusty married Judith Mary Troxel on August 17, 1954, in the chapel of Oaklawn Methodist Church in Dallas, Texas. Carl and Judy met on a blind date in South Bend and were engaged at the end of one week. He earned the nickname “Dusty” by blowing dust from his car he picked up during a sandstorm in New Mexico on her white dress on their first date. They were able to share 65 wonderful years together. Judy passed in December of 2019.\nAfter graduating high school, Carl joined the United States Air Force in August of 1950. He served in the Air Force as an Airman First Class during the Korean War until 1954. Carl worked many different jobs throughout his life, including work at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School as an instrument maker and at LTV. He retired from the U.S. Postal Service after 25 years in 1999. He oversaw heating and air conditioning at the North Texas Mail Processing Center. In his younger years Carl was a Dallas County Reserve Sheriff. He was a 32nd Degree Mason and was a member of Eastern Star. Carl was a past member of the Amateur Radio Relay League in Denton and enjoyed working with computers and amateur radios.\nCarl is survived by his two children, Gail Nadine Garber of Denton, Texas and Walter Wilkinson Garber of Temple, Texas; Granddaughters Danielle Judith Garber of Denton, Texas and her fiancé Andrew Paul Savage of Wylie, Texas, and Christian Marie Biddiscombe and her husband Christopher Biddiscombe of California; as well as Sister and Brother-in-law Judy and John Burkhart of Millersville, Maryland. He is preceded in death by his wife, Judy Garber, his brother Ralph Garber, and both of his parents.\nA graveside service for the family will be at the Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery on Friday, February 7, at 11:30 am. The service will be lead by Pastor Chuck Smith of Reach Church, Denton formerly known as Towne North Baptist Church, where Carl was a member.\nThe family would like to give a special thank you to Hutcherson Insurance Group and Brian Hutcherson for allowing Gail time to care for her dad at home. The family would also like to thank their Reach Church Denton family for all their love and support this week as well as over the years. Finally, the family thanks VNA Hospice and Nurse Barbara for their compassionate care and guidance this past year.\nOn line condolences may be made at www.mulkeybowlesmontgomery.com",
