  "text": "Fast fashion isn't just bad for the environment; it's not even good fashion, according to a viral TikTok video from alana likes to thrift (@atlantawithouthetea), an account known for her creative thrift store fashion finds.\nThe TikToker puts fashion trends on blast for not only contributing to wasteful practices, but for flying in the face of what fashion is supposed to be: creative, individual, expressive.\n@atlantawithouthetea subtitle is why i disliike the term & identity of \"fashion girly\" #rant #yap #coldtake #fashiontiktok #microtrend #trendcycle #overconsumption ♬ original sound - alana likes to thrift 👜📀💭 \"It's just virtue signaling,\" she says in the clip. It's about the item's brand and showing you know what's popular, not about what you actually want to express through your clothes, she says.\nPart of her beef is how quickly these fashion \"microtrends\" cycle in and out of style, rendering clothes dated within weeks sometimes and perpetuating a cycle of consumerism that strains the world's resources and landfills.\n\"What's the point?\" she seems to be asking. If you're going to engage in an environmentally harmful practice, you may as well look good, but people aren't even achieving that, she says.\nAnd her followers largely seem to agree.\nFROM OUR PARTNER Use this simple tool to keep your personal data from scammers Every day, data brokers profit from your sensitive info — like your phone number, date of birth, and social security number — by selling it to the highest bidder.\nAnd who’s buying it? Best case: companies that target you with ads. Worst case: scammers and identity thieves. That’s why it’s time to check out Incogni .\nIncogni’s innovative personal data removal service scrubs your personal information from the web , confronting the world’s data brokers on your behalf. And unlike other services, Incogni helps remove your sensitive information from all broker types, including those tricky “ people search sites .”\nHelp protect yourself from identity theft, spam calls, and health insurers trying to raise your rates.\nPlus: For a limited time, TCD readers get 55% off using code COOLDOWN.\nLearn more → Watch now: This classic mac and cheese brand just won an award for its packaging design \"Honestly I loooove people who aren't into 'fashion' cause their closets are so curated in a way that matches their lifestyle, values, and personality so much more than said fashion people,\" one follower said .\nNot immediately jumping on new trends is one way to avoid this pattern, another user said. \"This is why I wait months to buy anything new to make sure I actually want it and understand why I want it,\" the user wrote .\nThe fatigue with overconsumption and a loss of individuality rang out in the comment section.\n\"I can't stannnnd micro trends and I'm so exhausted by over consumption. Trendy does not equal good taste,\" another user summed it up .\nWhat should the government do about the fast fashion industry?\nSet strict regulations 🚫\nIncentivize sustainable options 💰\nUse both regulations and incentives 🏛️\nNothing 🙅\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\nIn other words, the advice here is not really that owning clothes that fit a trend is bad. It's that regularly buying a newly manufactured item, often shipped to your door, just to keep up with a trend is not a healthy pattern .\nIf you're going to buy a new piece of clothing, commit to keeping and wearing it many times. Or consider buying secondhand — or at least from a brand that emphasizes sustainability and durability.\nJoin our free newsletter for easy tips to save more and waste less , and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",
