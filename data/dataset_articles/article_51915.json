  "text": "Drew has become one of the most hated characters on General Hospital. That is a long way off from the original version of Drew. Is it really him?\nChanging Lanes\nWhen Drew (Cameron Mathison) came to Port Charles, he thought he was Jason (Steve Burton) and everyone loved him. He then realized he was Jason’s twin and came into his own. Drew was a great guy. He was brokenhearted when Sam (Kelly Monaco) left him for his brother but went on to create a life of his own. He discovered that Oscar (Garren Stitt) was his son and formed a strong bond with him in their short time together. Monica (Leslie Charleson) welcomed him into the Quartermaine family and he was the owner of Aurora Media.\nUnfortunately, he disappeared in a plane crash and was presumed dead for a few years. He reemerged (with a new face), and his old Drew qualities were still there. He longed to be a good dad to his daughter Scout (Cosette Abinante) and settled into a nice co-parenting relationship with Sam. Drew fell in love with Carly (Laura Wright) and even went to prison for her.\nIt was after he was released from Pentonville that the new version of Drew showed itself. The first sign was ending things with Carly because Jason was back, and he felt threatened. Then, he began an affair with his nephew’s wife with no regrets. He has become extremely mean and manipulative, advising Willow (Katelyn MacMullen) to keep Carly and Sonny (Maurice Benard) away from their burned son. He then took it upon himself to get a court order for her children. Drew even double-crossed his best friend Curtis (Donnell Turner). This guy is nothing like his old self.\nEvil Twin\nThere should be some explanation for why Drew has done a complete 180. The character is completely different, and it’s strange. Some say it’s because he almost died in prison, but the guy was held hostage by the Cassadines for years. That didn’t drastically change him.\nThe “evil twin” storyline has been done way too many times on GH and is too obvious. Plus, he only recently discovered he and Jason are twins. Triplets would be overkill.\nLet’s not forget the face mask storyline. Faison (Anders Hove) wore a Duke (Ian Buchanan) mask and fooled all of Port Charles, even Anna (Finola Hughes). He did it again when he masqueraded as Luke (Anthony Geary). Could the new Drew be an evil villain with a face mask while the real one is being held captive?\nDrew is not necessarily evil, but he makes disliking him very easy. Is there a reason behind this change, or is it just the new Drew? Let us know your opinion in the comments.",
