  "text": "Drummer Jason Roeder has seemingly deleted his Instgram in the wake of a recent post clarifying his status with influential post-metal band Neurosis and stoner/doom metal titans Sleep . Roeder recently began selling off his gear , stating in a post earlier this week that in part offered, “I am no longer a touring musician so I will be selling off most (possibly all) of my equipment and belongings.”\nIn a since-deleted post , Roeder offered some clarity, while also revealing that he was fired from Sleep this past November by the band’s manager. Roeder ‘s post read as follows:\n“Small vinyl archive for sale. 113 records. Would like to sell as one lot. (maybe to a record store?) All records in unopened, mint condition. Best offer.\nTo be clear, I have not “retired” from music. There is nothing on this earth that I would rather do. Life got in the way. One day I hope to jump back in. My personal circumstances prevent me from being able to make that a reality.\nA career in music is treacherous. I bet everything on it and lost.\nAs far as Neurosis goes – I don’t know. The remaining members are truly amazing people and with or without me I am sure they will continue to do mind-blowing work, whatever form it takes.\nAs far as Sleep goes, I was unceremoniously fired By Sleep’s manager over the phone back in November. I haven’t spoken to Al or Matt in months and that brings some peace to my life that I am thankful for.”\nNeurosis have remained on hiatus since 2022, following their vocalist/guitarist Scott Kelly admitting to abusing his wife and children .",
