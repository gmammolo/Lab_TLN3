  "text": "s A lot for my dad's body. David Beckham, who turned 50 this year, has released his own photos modeling his new bodywear collection for Hugo Boss. Bodyware seems to mean underwear if you are not used to this term. in Supported advertising clip Beckham returns home for the day in Bond -style Vintage Aston Martin, but he can not welcome his front with his sharp suit and shake his beanping with his tight white armchair. He set the bar very high for a middle -aged father who wants to drink, sit down and relax and relax in Homer Simpson -style pants. If you are conscious of your soft, squeezed, beer -inducing center, a new line of Beckham will not help.\nIn recent years, Dad's BOD seems to have been on a wide range of general acceptance and cautious celebration crisis. Many of us were blessing our timing. It looks like a trapped saudo mountain. We unintentionally felt unintentionally to be in his father, Vanguard. I am proud to be soft, hanging down.\nBeckham seems to be one step away from the new paradigm: too fast, as Shakespeare might have said. It goes without saying that it has been carved and made of bronze. And it is the end of January. Indeed, it is when we all ask for a refund that can be charged from a new gym membership that is wise and unused. You can say that he hasn't got it.\nUnfortunately, his characteristics of our culture means a male physique, especially the most acceptable standard for us, especially for us, which we thought we had safely surveyed. If it is possible to look like Beckham at the age of 50, it seems to be so, but the remaining people are not transparent enough. While brushing your teeth, you can't get such a physique standing on one leg.\nBeckham's body actually represents the average 50 men, of course, not all fitness, but not all fitness. And now that time is gone.\nBut even if you commit to the amount of training you need, who spent time in the past 10 years? Forget your exercise -I don't think I could even collect as many tattoos as Beckham. I look at all of that ink and think.\nIt is David Beckham's job that looks like David Beckham. There is another job in our rest, and there is a valuable leisure to drink underwear in our condition. Finns call it Kalsarikännit -A art of drinking at home in pants -and this important shape is completely restored by his representative bodyware, Beckham.\nEveryone looks back at their death floor and says, “I wish I had more crunch.” Unless you are dying with something directly caused by the lack of core strength. In that case: For shame.",
