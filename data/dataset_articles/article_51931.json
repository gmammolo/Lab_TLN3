  "text": "Lack of Snow Adding Up, Osseo Dealer Reports Shrinking Snowmobile Sales\nFor some, snow means money.\nAnd the lack of the white stuff can impact a business’ bottom line.\n“It’s been a little slow. The lack of snow really hasn’t helped,” said Jordan Deutcher with\nHeinen Motorsports in Osseo.\nDeutcher says snowmobile sales are down 20 percent from a typical year.\nSince the local snowmobile base isn’t strong this year, the motorsports store is trying to recoup losses by attracting customers where there is snow.\n“We’ve been doing some advertising out West in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana area,” said Deutcher.\nDeutcher said he has three snowmobiles that will be delivered on Sunday to Colorado.\nThe store is also offering deep discounts to sell their snowmobile inventory. It’s also relying on sales of other inventory such as ATVs.\n“Four-wheelers and side-by-sides have been selling because people are able to use that while they are out ice fishing,” said Deutcher.\nStill Hope for Snow\nSteve Reckers, who records data for the National Weather Service at his New Hope home, has been keeping a close eye on snow totals.\nReckers says 33 inches of snow should have fallen by now. However, only 12 inches of snow has fallen this winter season.\nHe says there’s still time to turn things around.\n“Almost half of our normal snowfall comes in February, March, and April, so we could catch up in a hurry,” said Reckers.\nIt’s a ray of hope for businesses that get a lift from falling snow.\n“The snow’s coming, I feel it,” said Deutcher.\nDeutcher said many local customers who have bought snowmobiles have trips planned up north where there is snow.\nIf it feels like it has been a long time without a lot of snow, that’s because you have to go back to 2023, when Minnesota experienced its\nthird snowiest winter on record.",
