  "text": "By Susan Vela, Lansing State Journal ,\n10 hours ago\nLANSING — The two flights between Capital Region International Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport were canceled Thursday because of the tragedy in Washington, D.C .\nThe airport’s web page for arrivals and departures showed American Airlines 5640’s arrival and departure were canceled.\nOperations Officer Jake Krystyniak said the Washington route is currently down because of the Wednesday night crash between a passenger plane with 64 people aboard and an Army helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n“All the rest of our flights are running on time,” Krystyniak said.\nAmerican Airlines 5640 was scheduled for a 4:38 p.m. arrival in Lansing and a 5:08 p.m. departure to Washington on Thursday.\nContact editor Susan Vela at svela@lsj.com or 248-873-7044.
