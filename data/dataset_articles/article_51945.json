  "text": "By Tatiana Krisztina & Victoria Johns ,\n2 hours ago Amid the ongoing drama with Justin Baldoni , pop sensation Taylor Swift appears to be distancing herself from Blake Lively, according to sources\nBlake, 37, and Justin, 40, both stars of It Ends With Us, have been caught up in a heated legal dispute since the Gossip Girl star accused her co-star of sexual harassment and fostering a hostile work environment on the set of the popular Colleen Hoover adaptation. In a recent development, Justin, who also directed the film, has launched a counter-lawsuit against Blake, making a series of shocking allegations .\nIn his $400 million lawsuit filed earlier this month, Justin claims an unnamed A-list celebrity, believed to be Swift due to her mention in related text messages, pressured him to \"comply with Blake's direction for the script\" during a meeting at Blake's house. This follows an incident where Blake reportedly complained to Justin.\nREAD MORE: Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's It Ends With Us lawsuits set for March 2026 trial date\nREAD MORE: Justin Baldoni admits he's a 'flawed man' as he releases bombshell voicemail amid Blake Lively feud\nAccording to the lawsuit, Justin reportedly texted Blake praising her revisions to a scene as \"so much more fun and interesting,\" but cheekily noted he \"would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor,\" followed by a playful emoji. In response, Blake allegedly likened herself to the iconic Game of Thrones character Khaleesi, referring to Reynolds and Swift as her two \"dragons.\"\nHer purported message read: \"I happen to have a few dragons. For better or worse, but usually for better,\" and continued, \"Because my dragons also protect those I fight for. So really we all benefit from those gorgeous monsters of mine. [Smiley-face emoji] you will too, I can promise you,\" reports the Mirror .\nTaylor and Blake have had a close relationship over the years, with Taylor interweaving Blake's children Betty, Inez, and James into her songs. The songstress also took Blake with her to the Super Bowl last year as they cheered on Taylor's beau Travis Kelce, who was competing in the championship.\nBut it seems like Blake might not be joining Taylor at this Super Bowl, as sources claim that Taylor is trying to distance herself from the ongoing drama. An insider told the Daily Mail : \"For the time being she is taking a step back from Blake because she doesn’t want to get tangled in this more than she already has – which is far more than she ever needed to be.\"\nThe controversy, which erupted in 2023, is believed to have originated from Blake's alterations to the rooftop scene in their romantic drama, It Ends With Us. Despite receiving support from her husband Ryan and close friend Taylor, not everyone was on board with the changes, as evidenced by text messages from April 2023 included in the $400 million lawsuit against Blake.\nThe aftermath reportedly extended for several days, prompting Justin to feel \"obliged\" to text his co-star in an attempt at reconciliation. The complaint revealed Blake's comprehensive text response, where she allegedly conveyed: \"They [Reynolds and Swift] also know I'm not always good at making sure I'm seen and utilized for fear of threatening egos, or fear of affecting the ease of the process.\"\n\"They don't give a s*** about that. And because of that, everyone listens to them with immense respect and enthusiasm. So I guess I have to stop worrying about people liking me.\"\n4",
