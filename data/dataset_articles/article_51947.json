  "text": "Does Chick-Fil-A Serve A Fish Sandwich?\nBad news for fish fans and fasting Catholics: Chick-fil-A's Fish Sandwich probably isn't coming back — ever. The chain stopped offering its seasonal fish menu in 2021, and it hasn't re-appeared since. When the chain's website confirmed that there once again would be no fish offerings, internet sleuths suspected that it would be a permanent decision.\nTrue to Chick-fil-A's religious stance, the restaurant used to offer a small fish-based menu for Lent. While many Catholics give up meat for the fast — which starts six weeks before Easter — fish has historically been an exception to the meat-free rule. In previous years, fish sandwiches featured fried and battered cod fillets served in a buttered bun. Options varied from year to year, but the sandwiches often featured pickles and tartar sauce. One of a series of discontinued fast food fish sandwiches, the beloved Chick-fil-A Deluxe Fish Sandwich added lettuce, tomato, and American cheese to the mix. Select Chick-fil-A locations even served fish nuggets or fish tenders, too.\nWhy Chick-fil-A doesn't serve the fish sandwich\nWhile the chain itself stayed mum on the decision to discontinue its fish offerings, Reddit has filled the void on possible reasonings. According to one Redditor, an internal company memo cited limitations with the fryers as the reason for the discontinuation. Others suggested that corporate required locations to dedicate one fryer strictly to fish. A reported employee explained that the sandwiches required specialized production processes. With the chain already operating at max capacity, the seasonal sandwich gummed up the works. Those who claimed to be in the know also guessed that the fish sandwich probably won't be coming back.\nBut Catholics and others who stick to a pescatarian diet still have options at Chick-fil-A. The chain's website provides a list of vegan and vegetarian menu options, noting that prep surfaces may not be totally meat-free. Folks on fish-only diets can still enjoy popular menu items like egg-and-cheese biscuits, hashbrowns, and the chain's famous waffle fries. The list also suggests modifying menu items, too, like ordering your fruit-filled Market Salad chicken-free. You'll also have the somewhat less-appetizing option of asking for a Grilled Chicken Cool Wrap without chicken — which leaves you with lettuce, flatbread, and cheese.\nStill craving fish? Of the fast food joints that serve high quality fish, popular chains like Culver's and Arby's offer solid fish sandwiches. McDonald's fish sandwich is the Lent OG, though: Back in 1962, the chain created the Filet-O-Fish specifically for fasting Catholic customers.",
