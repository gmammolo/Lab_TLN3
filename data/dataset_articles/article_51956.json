  "text": "It’s January 30, and the countdown to Valentine’s has officially begun! With just two weeks to go until the big red day, couples everywhere are gearing up for romantic surprises, candlelit dinners, and Instagram-worthy moments.\nBut while some are planning the perfect date, others are unknowingly heading straight for heartbreak.\nYes, sis, while you’re dreaming of roses and chocolates, your boyfriend might be plotting his great escape.\nSo, before you start picking out your red dress, let’s talk about why your man might be planning to dump you before February 14th. And trust me, the signs are always there!\nHe can’t handle pressure of Valentine’s expectations\nLet’s face it, Valentine’s Day comes with expectations. The flowers, the dinner, the gift… for some men, it’s just too much.\nIf he’s not the romantic type or he’s on a tight budget, he might see breaking up as the easiest way out.\nRather than admit he doesn’t want to deal with the pressure, he’ll start acting distant, picking fights over small things, or even 'ghosting' just before the big day.\nHe’s already checked out of the relationship\nSome guys stay in a relationship long after they’ve emotionally checked out. Maybe he’s been losing interest for a while, but instead of ending things earlier, he’s been coasting along. Unfortunately, Valentine’s Day forces people to reflect on their relationships.\nIf he’s realised that he doesn’t see a future with you, he might choose this moment to call it quits. Why spend money and effort on a relationship he no longer values? It’s harsh, but some people wait for a 'convenient time' to break up—and for him, that might be right before Valentine’s Day.\nThere’s someone else in the picture\nThis is the worst-case scenario, but let’s be honest—it happens. If your boyfriend has been pulling away emotionally, suddenly changing his routine, or getting secretive with his phone, another woman might be in the picture.\nValentine’s Day makes it harder for guys who are double-dealing. If he’s involved with someone else, he may find it easier to break up than to juggle two women on the most romantic day of the year.\nHe’s scared of commitment\nFor some men, Valentine’s Day isn’t just about love—it’s about defining where the relationship is headed.\nThe pressure of grand gestures, social media posts, and deep conversations about the future can be intimidating.\nIf your relationship has been moving towards something serious and he’s not ready for commitment, he might panic and bolt.\nRather than face the possibility of deeper emotional investment, he might choose to break up instead.\nHe’s using it as an excuse to avoid gifting\nSome guys simply hate the idea of spending money on Valentine’s Day. If your boyfriend is known for being overly frugal or allergic to grand gestures, he might be looking for a way out.\nIt sounds ridiculous, but there are men who break up just to avoid buying gifts, only to reappear a few weeks later as if nothing happened.\nIf he’s suddenly complaining about how “commercialised” Valentine’s Day is, or how “we don’t need a special day to celebrate love,” be wary—he might just be setting up his escape plan.\nHe feels the relationship isn’t growing\nSome men break up not because they want to, but because they feel stuck. If he thinks your relationship isn’t progressing or has become repetitive, he might take Valentine’s Day as a sign to re-evaluate things.\nHas he mentioned feeling uninspired or “not sure what he wants” lately? If so, he might be using this time to pull away. It’s not always about wanting someone else—sometimes, it’s about not knowing what he truly wants.\nWhat should you do?\nIf you sense a breakup is coming, don’t ignore the signs. Here’s what you can do:\nCommunicate – If something feels off, talk about it. Ignoring the problem won’t make it go away.\nObserve his actions – Words mean little if his actions don’t match. Is he avoiding you? Cancelling plans? Acting disinterested?\nPrepare for the worst, hope for the best – If he does break up with you, remember that a man who leaves before Valentine’s was never your person to begin with.\nIf he leaves, let him go\nHeartbreak is painful, but a man who dumps you just before Valentine’s Day was never truly committed. If he’s walking away now, imagine what he would do in more serious situations.\nLove should never feel like an obligation, and if someone chooses to leave, it’s their loss. So if he breaks up with you before Valentine’s, buy yourself chocolates, take yourself out, and celebrate the fact that you dodged a bullet.\nThe right love won’t make you question your worth—it will make you feel cherished, every day, not just on February 14th.",
