It was an obvious joke; you could have deleted it or come to my DM to say, ‘Haba, babe, I don’t like it,’ and I’d sharply apologize and delete it. It was never intended to hurt you but I guess it hurts so much because it’s true!!\nThunder fire you. Block me so you can sleep at night but you cannot block the voice in your head telling you the truth. The truth is bitter.\nCrew members are human beings!! Stop treating them like Animals and making clout-chasing videos to look like a good person. A lot of crew members turn down jobs when they hear you are on it. That’s deep bro.\nOnly your friend will tell you your mouth is smelling. You have blocked your sister too. You will keep blocking my dear”.\n“My mother always complains about the way I joke, saying that not everybody sometimes finds it funny. I truly apologize to my big brother and former friend Frederick. This thing pains me. I no go lie. Kilagbe kileju. It is well”.\nTop Stories\nPopular Stories\nStories from this Category\nRecent Stories\nHome\n|\nAbout Us\n|\nContact Us\n|\nDisclaimer\n|\nPrivacy Policy\n|\nTerms Of service\n|\nAdvertise With Us\n|\nfacebook\n|\nTwitter\n|\nGoogle+\nCopyright © 2025.
