As a result, the team remains winless in the WAC with a 0-7 record.\n- Sydnie Rodriguez scored a season-high 13 points, including three three-pointers.\n- Seattle U shot 30.6% from the floor compared to GCU's 54.7%.\n- Redhawks started strong, leading 9-6 early but fell behind by 25 points at halftime.\n- Despite a brief resurgence, GCU's scoring surge sealed the game for the Lopes.\nSeattle U will have a break over the weekend before heading to Texas to face Tarleton State and UT Arlington next week.
