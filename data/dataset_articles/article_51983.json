  "text": "By Casey Young ,\n7 hours ago\nLet the woman dance, dang it. Luke Combs is currently on tour in Australia and he's also been teasing new music over there, so hopefully that means he has some new tunes on the way in addition to announcing more U.S. concert dates . It's actually really neat how many other countries are into country music, and many artists do really well with the international audiences, especially in Europe and Australia. And one fan in particular was clearly having the time of her life at Luke's show in Brisbane at Suncorp Stadium a few days ago. In fact, according to security she was having a little too much fun, because she wound up getting kicked out for \"dancing too hard,\" as reported by The Courier-Mail , an Australian newspaper published in Brisbane. Several vides of her have gone viral on TikTok, where she's seen dancing while Luke's opener Mitchell Tenpenny was on... seriously, she was living her best life. Here's a few different angles: @lily_ballard24 Still didn’t stop her from having a boogie 😂 #foryoupage #lukecombs ♬ Oh No - Kreepa @team_tooney_fishing @Luke Combs was epic but the crowd was a close 2nd! #letthegirldance #sendherhomebuddy #teamtooneyfishing #lukecombsaustraliantour #lukecombs @Mitchell Tenpenny @jordandavis @Lane pitttman @Lily Ballard ♬ original sound - Team_Tooney_Fishing🇦🇺 Well, the woman, named Jolene (seriously, you can't make this stuff up), was also seen jokingly twerking on one of the security people, so I have to imagine that might've been the final straw if they were already considering kicking her out, though it's kind of unclear because she does walk away after doing that. She was escorted out before Combs even went onstage, after being stopped by security after returning from the bathroom... so she didn't even really get to see the concert, which sucks, especially considering how rarely they get big-name country concerts of this caliber over there. KIIS 97.3 breakfast hosts Kip Wightman, Robin Bailey, and Corey Oates spoke with Jolene yesterday, and she says she was just there \"having the time of my life,\" wanting to enjoy the music: \"I was literally just having the time of my life. I was dancing to one of my favorite artists, Mitchell Tenpenny, and then supposedly… the lady in the pink dress behind me had gotten me kicked out… she obviously didn’t like my dancing. I was just enjoying myself too much. I didn’t really care about what was around me. The security guard called me over and said ‘we’re really sorry, we’re going to have to get you to leave.’ And I’m like, ‘What? Why?’ And they said ‘There’s been a complaint about you dancing and stuff.’ I didn’t even get to see Luke Combs.” Bummer... A Suncorp Stadium spokesperson stated that “patrons are not evicted solely for dancing”: \"The patron was engaging in activity that was against the conditions of entry which are designed to allow all fans to enjoy events at the Stadium and so there was no choice but to evict her.\" Jolene also explained that the stadium \"reposted\" one of her videos on their Instagram page, though if that's true, it's no longer on there. She added that she \"never expected\" all of the attention: \"They actually reposted my video on that on their on their Instagram page. So it’s on every platform of social media. It’s, it’s crazy hard. I never expected this. Hopefully I can get to Melbourne too!\" Jolene hopes to still make it to Luke's show in Sydney, which will take place tomorrow night and Saturday night. Though she clarified that she made sure to get general admission seats this time so she can stand and dance as much as she wants: \"I did actually ask them what seats they were, and the lady... said they’re usually really good seats. And I was like, ‘well, if possible, GA (general admission) would be great.\" The Courier-Mail shared Tenpenny's response video, and I have to agree with him in that Jolene was just having a grand old time enjoying country music. I can see how it could be a little annoying to others around her, but they're just sitting there listening and I would think wanting to be there and have fun too. It looks like Jolene had floor seats, which are typically pretty pricey, so I don't blame her for wanting to enjoy the experience as much as possible, again, considering how rarely artists like Combs get over there. Luke, if you're seeing this, get Jolene some tickets in Sydney where she can dance to her hearts content and enjoy the full Luke Combs stadium concert experience. I have no doubt she'll be one of the most enthusiastic fans in the crowd... but yeah, Jolene, maybe refrain from twerking on the security people (though I have to admit, that was the funniest part): Head over to Vivid Seats to grab tickets when Luke Combs is playing near you. They're the only platform that gives you free tickets just for going to concerts, not a bad deal am I right? https://www.instagram.com/couriermail/reel/DFZg5BgPHZK/ Here's the song the unreleased song he teased in Brisbane, \"Pushin’ Up Daisies\": https://www.instagram.com/p/DFTZ4rdxaU9/ This post contains links from our Affiliate Partners program.
