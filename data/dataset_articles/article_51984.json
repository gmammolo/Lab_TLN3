  "text": "Tom Selleck causes concern after celebrating 80th birthday with 'lonely' trip to McDonald'\nBlue Bloods and Magnum PI star Tom Selleck was spotted whisking away from his 80th birthday celebrations to grab some fast food from a McDonald's drive-thru in California\nActing heavyweight Tom Selleck, known for captivating audiences in roles from Magnum, P. I. to Blue Bloods, opted for an understated celebration of his 80th birthday.\nEschewing the flash of Hollywood, he was seen at a McDonald's drive-thru in Thousand Oaks, California, picking up a casual lunch alone.\nEmphasizing a laid-back birthday approach, Tom previously confided to Parade magazine his nondescript outlook on such personal milestones.\nHe said: \"None whatsoever. I'll probably have dinner with maybe my brother and my sister and Jillie, just go out to dinner, kind of be quiet, and not make a big deal of it.\"\nIn reference to his wife, Jillie Mack, Tom enjoys low-key observances over grand affairs.\nObservers noted that even on this special occasion, he ate peacefully in his truck — a scene aligning perfectly with his no-frills stance on birthdays.\n\"I'm trying not to count. I stopped celebrating birthdays a while back. I intend to keep working,\" he shared, revealing a preference for normalcy instead of opulence on his big day.\nLate last year, Tom Selleck was considering his next steps as the curtain came down on the beloved CBS police drama series, Blue Bloods.\nDON'T MISS...\n[Kevin Costner's tremendously high net worth as he makes Yellowstone return [NEWS]](/entertainment/celebrity-news/162009/kevin-costners-high-net-worth-yellowstone-return)\n[Roseanne Barr plans TV comeback with self penned 'silly' new comedy series [LATEST]](/entertainment/celebrity-news/162005/Roseanne-Barr-TV-comeback-silly-new-comedy-series)\n[Rihanna surprises many as she supports A$AP Rocky at firearm trial [PICTURES]](/entertainment/celebrity-news/162004/rihanna-asap-rocky-trial-firearm-case)\nHaving played the role of family patriarch Frank Reagan across all 14 seasons, the former Magnum PI lead has become a household name over the show's successful decade-plus run.\nFans were devastated when the final season of Blue Bloods aired last October. However, Tom is not retiring from television just yet, despite wrapping up the final eight episodes of Blue Bloods.\nHe's hinted at returning in another fan-favorite role and no, it's not as Thomas Magnum.\nBefore we first saw him in Blue Bloods back in 2010, Tom captivated audiences in the Jesse Stone: Stone Cold TV film, playing the eponymous small-town police chief.\nIn the nine TV films adapted from Robert B Parker's gripping novels, he brought to life the New England top cop solving mysteries in the quaint town of Paradise, Massachusetts.\nTom didn't just act; he also wrote several installments and even earned an Emmy nomination for his work in the 2007 movie Jesse Stone: Sea Change, a testament to his connection to the character.\nHe's considering a comeback to the Jesse Stone series, and this time he might have to take on writing duties as well, telling TV Insider: \"It looks like now I might have to write [the script].\"\nYet, he teased that the story isn't over, adding: \"It wouldn't be a final one because everybody loves it. Jesse is a great character, and it would be fascinating to find out where he is quite a few years later.\"\nFollow Daily Express US\nGet all the latest news, entertainment, sport and lifestyle updates from our dedicated American team.\nSign up for our newsletters HERE.",
