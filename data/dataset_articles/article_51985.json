  "text": "Justin Bieber sparks concern among fans after worrying appearance in New York\nJustin Bieber has appeared to ditch his longer hair in favor of a new buzz cut as he was spotted looking tired as he walked through New York City on Wednesday.\nPop sensation Justin Bieber was barely recognizable as he stepped out in New York City on Wednesday.\nThe Canadian heartthrob embarked on his city adventure without his wife, Hailey Bieber, 28, but was accompanied by a group of people.\nThe new father appeared weary as he strolled through the city, showcasing a dramatic buzz cut.\nThe 30-year-old singer donned his signature oversized attire, pairing a bright yellow hoodie with beige pants.\nHe seemed to be holding up his trousers at the crotch to prevent them from slipping down, yet they still dragged on the ground beneath his standout fuzzy footwear.\nJustin's exhausted look could be attributed to the demands of first-time parenthood, following the recent birth of his son, Jack Blues, with Hailey.\nThe sighting came after insiders told the Daily Mail that Justin's wife Hailey's friends are growing increasingly concerned about Justin's actions.\nAccording to the source, some of her inner circle is encouraging Hailey to leave the musician after 'putting up with a lot' since their marriage began.\nDON'T MISS...\n[Justin Bieber breaks silence after 'suss' Hailey Bieber unfollowing move [COMMENT]](/entertainment/celebrity-news/161168/justin-bieber-breaks-silence-sus)\n[Justin Bieber 'working on new music' after he unfollows stars on Instagram [LATEST]](/entertainment/celebrity-news/161060/justin-bieber-new-music-Instagram)\n[Justin Bieber surprises fans with shirtless snap as they spot detail [PICTURES]](/entertainment/celebrity-news/160838/justin-bieber-Calvin-Klein-underwear-instagram)\nThe couple announced the arrival of their baby boy on August 23, 2024, shortly after Hailey unveiled her pregnancy in May with a breathtaking photoshoot.\nHailey and Justin exchanged vows in 2018, but their family dynamics shifted after the birth of Jack Blues. Reportedly, Hailey decided to keep her son away from her parents following a fallout when she became pregnant.\nJustin has unfollowed his father-in-law, Stephen Baldwin, on social media, who has yet to reciprocate the action.\nDespite this apparent lack of familial support, sources have claimed that Justin and his wife Hailey are extremely happy together as they navigate first-time parenthood, even referring to it as a \"learning experience\".\nHailey herself has publicly expressed her happiness with Justin, despite persistent rumors of an impending divorce.\nHowever, an insider close to the couple suggested to the Daily Mail last week that after the initial joy of welcoming their son, the pair may be experiencing difficulties once more.\n\"Hailey's been struggling with Justin almost since the start of the marriage,\" the source revealed.\n\"She loves him madly but he's a loose cannon. Some of her friends have advised her to go it alone and leave him. His behavior is sometimes unacceptable. She's put up with a lot.\"\nThe source further added that the birth of their son, Jack Blues, seemed to bring about a positive change, but friends are now witnessing things deteriorate again.\nDespite the swirling rumors, Hailey remains firm that all is well with Justin. \"People have made me feel so bad about my relationship since day one,\" she confessed to W Magazine last year.\nFollow Daily Express US\nGet all the latest news, entertainment, sport and lifestyle updates from our dedicated American team.\nSign up for our newsletters HERE.",
