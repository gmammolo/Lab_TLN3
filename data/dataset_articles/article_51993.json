The sighting comes just days after the couple, who have been married for over six years and welcomed their son, Jack Blues Bieber, last summer, appeared to be in good spirits during a date night together over the weekend, presenting a united front despite the recent buzz.\nAlso Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's post-game conversation revealed after Chiefs secure Super Bowl spot\nJustin Bieber’s looks dishevelled in recent appearance\nThe Baby singer was spotted wearing his signature dishevelled-chic look, donning a bright yellow hoodie, baggy cargo pants, and fuzzy slipper-like shoes. As he walked through the bustling streets of New York City, Justin Bieber caught attention when he made a dramatic gesture, grabbing his crotch while strolling down the busy sidewalk, as reported by Daily Mail.\nHe completed his look with a black baseball cap as walked to his luxury SUV parked around teh corner. Meanwhile, Hailey was seen exiting a building in Union Square all alone.\nTheir appearances follow recent rumours of a tumultuous marriage as Bieber unfollowed his wife on Instagram only to clarify as he wrote, “Someone went on my account and unfollowed my wife.

Last week, an insider told the outlet, “Hailey's been struggling with Justin almost since the start of the marriage. She loves him madly but he's a loose cannon. Some of her friends have advised her to go it alone and leave him. His behaviour is sometimes unacceptable. She's put up with a lot.”\nThe source also added that Hailey and those close to her were hopeful that the birth of their baby would bring in some changes. The insider shared, “When the baby was born he was there for her and she thought being a father would change him for the better, but it hasn't stuck.”\nExplore now!.\nGet more updates from\nBollywood,\nTaylor Swift,\nHollywood,\nMusicand\nWeb Seriesalong with\nLatest Entertainment Newsat Hindustan Times.\nExplore now!.\nGet more updates from\nBollywood,\nTaylor Swift,\nHollywood,\nMusicand\nWeb Seriesalong with\nLatest Entertainment Newsat Hindustan Times.\n[News](https://www.hindustantimes.com)/\n[Entertainment](https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment)/\n[Music](https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/music)/ Justin Bieber's hollowed-eye appearance fuels marital issue rumours with Hailey Bieber",
