  "text": "The 2025 All-Star Game is fast approaching, and today the All-Star reserves were revealed. We already knew who the starters were, including Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant. But these final picks weren’t determined by the fan vote. They were made by head coaches across the NBA, who’ve weighed in on who deserves to attend the game in San Francisco on February 16.\nThe list?\n2025 NBA West All-Star reserves: Anthony Edwards, Anthony Davis, James Harden, Jaren Jackson Jr., Alperen Sengun, Jalen Williams, Victor Wembanyama.\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania)[January 30, 2025]\nMissing from this list is Devin Booker, who would have made his fifth All-Star appearance in his 10th season had he been selected. Guards who did make it? Anthony Edwards, James Harden, and Jalen Williams.\nWhile you can certainly make a case for Booker, it’s not hard to see why he was left off. The Suns have struggled, hovering around the .500 mark for much of the season. Generally, players on underperforming teams don’t get the same All-Star recognition. Add in the surge of young, explosive talent in the Western Conference, and it’s clear why Booker faces an uphill battle for a spot this year.\nHis numbers this season? Not bad. He’s averaging 25.5 points per game and 6.7 assists. However, his shooting splits aren’t exactly impressive. 44/34/90. Despite attempting the most three-pointers of his career, he’s having one of his worst seasons from beyond the arc. So, while it’s understandable why he didn’t make the cut, would I call it a snub? I wouldn’t go that far.\nI won’t dive into my usual rant about how the All-Star game is being run this year. What’s the point at this stage? It is what it is. Will I watch? Probably. I’ve got nothing better to do on February 16 — checks planner — yep, not a damn thing. So, I’ll tune in. We’ll see if it actually grabs my attention; if the shiny new gimmicks turn out to be as cool as the hype.\nBut one thing I know for sure: there will be Phoenix Suns representation, and that’s at least one reason to watch. The other? Maybe the uniforms?\nPoll\nDo you think Devin Booker was snubbed?\n-\n39%\nYes\n-\n60%\nNo\nVote Now",
