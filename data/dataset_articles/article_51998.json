He also stated that he has the keys to victory if he were to fight du Plessis.\nDDP responded to this claim during an interview with MainEventTV, calling the fight an easy payday if it were to ever happen. He explained how although Makhachev is big for the lightweight division, he considers himself big for the middleweight division.\nRelated\nHow Islam Makhachev is On the Path to Becoming the Greatest UFC Fighter Ever\nUFC Lightweight Champion Islam Makhachev has taken over the MMA world by storm, all while slowly moving up in the greatest fighter rankings.\nDana White Responds To Makhachev's Middleweight Aspirations\nThe UFC President Is Not A Fan Of Islam's Idea Of Fighting Two Weight Classes Up\nUFC President Dana White commented on Makhachev potentially moving up to middleweight at the Power Slap 11 Press Conference, essentially stating that it won't happen. White is open to Islam moving up to welterweight, though the champion will not do so as he is good friends with the current UFC Welterweight Champion, Belal Muhammad.\nWhen it came to a move regarding the 185 pound division, Dana explained how it was a different level, visibly expressing doubt about Islam's chances. He did not outright deny the idea, though it currently seems very unlikely.\nThere have been talks about a potential superfight between UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Alex Pereira coming back down to middleweight and challenging Dricus, and given the smaller weight difference, White was much more open to that idea.\nRelated\nHow Islam Makhachev Made Company History At UFC 311\nAt UFC 311, Islam Makhachev became the lightweight GOAT with most UFC Lightweight Championship wins and defenses.",
