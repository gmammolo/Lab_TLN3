  "text": "A bride-to-be is feeling nervous about her upcoming nuptials due to her lack of close friends who can serve as bridesmaids.\nA wedding is usually a monumental event that's counted down and looked forward to, but one bride wishes she could avoid it altogether. Despite being thrilled about her engagement, she's been feeling \"embarrassed\" and \"a bit like a loser\" during the wedding planning process.\nShe shared on Reddit she's the \"stereotypical girl whose best friend is their partner with no other friends.\" Her fiancé, on the other hand, has a large group of friends he wants in his wedding party.\nWhile she's happy for him, she feels \"embarrassed\" that he'll have groomsmen while she doesn't have a single bridesmaid. She fears it will be embarrassing standing at the altar with no one on her side while his side is full.\nThe bride-to-be also laments the likelihood of missing out on traditional pre-wedding events like a bachelorette party or bridal shower, with no close friends to make plans or arrangements for such things.\nDespite her excitement about the prospect of being married, she admits to dreading the wedding day itself due to her anxiety over this issue. The woman shared her lack of close friends is due to growing up in a \"really strict religion\". When she left it, she was \"shunned\" and \"left with no friends\".\nShe explained: \"The religion frowns upon making friends outside of the religion so I didn’t have other friends when that happened. Ever since that’s happened, I’ve had a really tough time making friends despite actively trying.\"\nThis has led her to desire an elopement or a \"really small\" wedding, but her partner wants a \"big\" wedding with everyone present.\nPeople offered their thoughts in the comments section. One person asked: \"Have you had to sit down heart-to-heart with your soon-to-be? Have you really made him listen about how you’re feeling about the big wedding and how big the disparity is between you two?\n\"Weddings are about unity and they’re about the couple - if half of the couple is not enjoying the wedding, why have one? I think a very big conversation needs to be had very soon.\"\nAnother suggested: \"Could you go do the ceremony with just the two of you and then have a big party afterwards where nobody is expected to have any kind of specific roles? Just one big event where nobody is elevated to a particular position... it would be a lot less \"his\" and \"her\" sides\".\nPlenty of people advised the woman to befriend the girlfriends of her fiancé’s friends. One individual remarked: \"Honestly it might be a great moment to get closer with the women in his life? My current bestie is exactly like you.\n\"She didn’t really have her own close friends, but the women in her husband’s life all rallied around her for wedding stuff. We all bonded a ton in the process and now we’re really close!\"",
