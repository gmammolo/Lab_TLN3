  "text": "Keen watchers of the global export figures for the Swiss watch industry might conclude that 2024 was a little more challenging than the record-breaking 2023, but nothing to panic about.\nTotal exports for last year ended on CHF 26 billion, just 2.8% below the CHF 26.75 billion in 2023.\nThat is the second highest total of the past quarter of a century and should be cause for the Champagne corks to be flying again.\nIf this is the first draft for the history of the Swiss watch industry in 2024, it would be wrong.\nThe actual story is one of huge market share gains for privately-owned Rolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet from the group brands of Richemont, Swatch Group and LVMH, which have seen their sales soften.\nSwatch Group revealed its full year results for 2024 this morning with sales of CHF 6.7 billion, down 12.2% at constant currency rates or 14.6% lower at current rates.\nOperating profit plunged by 75% from CHF 1.2 billion to CHF 304 million.\nSwatch Group’s share price dropped by 5% at the opening bell this morning and is down 22.5% over the past year.\nIt is worth putting Swatch Group’s 2024 results in context.\nIt was only the second year since 2012 that sales have dropped below CHF 7 billion — the other being the pandemic year of 2020.\nRolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet have collectively more than doubled sales over the past decade.\nRichemont’s latest quarterly result shows total sales rising by 11%, but the group turnover was greatly strengthened by its jewellery maisons Van Cleef & Arpel and Cartier.\nIts watch sales were down by 8% in the same quarter at €867 million.\nLVMH’s full year results for 2024 saw turnover dip by 2% to €85 billion.\nThe group’s watch division housing Hublot, TAG Heuer and Zenith, is bundled into the much larger Watches & Jewelry business, which includes Tiffany & Co., Chaumet and Bulgari. The division saw a sales dip of 2%.",
