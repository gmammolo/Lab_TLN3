  "text": "Celebrity News\nAryan Khan scores legal relief as Delhi High Court rejects Sameer Wankhede’s defamation suit\nAryan Khan has received legal relief after the Delhi High Court rejected Sameer Wankhede’s defamation suit against his Netflix series. The court declined to examine the allegations, citing lack of jurisdiction. The ruling ends the Delhi proceedings for now. Here’s what the order means.\nSameer Wankhede vs Aryan Khan: The Delhi High Court has dismissed a defamation suit filed by Indian Revenue Service officer Sameer Wankhede against the Netflix series The Ba***ds of Bollywood, directed by Aryan Khan. The court ruled that it lacked the jurisdiction to hear the matter and, on that basis, declined to examine the merits of Wankhede’s allegations.\nIn its order, the High Court observed that the plea, as framed, could not be entertained before it. As a result, the bench chose not to go into the substance of the claims or assess whether the portrayal in the series amounted to defamation. The ruling effectively brings the proceedings in Delhi to an end, at least in their current form.\nDelhi High Court rejects Sameer Wankhede’s defamation suit\nThe case dates back to October, when the Delhi High Court had issued notices to Netflix and Red Chillies Entertainment after Wankhede alleged that a character in the series closely resembled him and damaged his reputation. At the time, the court had asked both parties to submit their responses to the petition.\nReacting to the legal battle last year, Wankhede spoke publicly about the personal toll the controversy had taken on him and his family. Speaking to ANI, he said, “My personal belief is that this has nothing to do with my job or my profession. In my personal capacity, I’ve approached the Delhi High Court. I wouldn’t like to comment on the court proceedings or the issues involved, because the matter has been sub judice… This is a matter of self-respect, personal dignity, and personal honour. Whatever satire or parody you create, do it with your own people.”\nHe also raised concerns about online abuse and threats allegedly directed at his family. “Today, the issue of drug abuse has become a major issue for our nation, and by highlighting such things, you’re insulting not just one person, but those who have worked with me,” he said, adding that his wife and sister had received hate messages from across borders. “I will not accept that because of me, they are facing the brunt of it.”\nAryan Khan’s infamous drug case\nThe defamation row traces its roots to the high-profile 2021 Mumbai cruise drug raid, during which Wankhede arrested Aryan Khan, the son of actor Shah Rukh Khan. Aryan Khan was cleared of all charges in 2022. He later made his directorial debut with The Ba***ds of Bollywood, which premiered on Netflix on September 18, 2025.\nClick for more latest Celebrity news.
