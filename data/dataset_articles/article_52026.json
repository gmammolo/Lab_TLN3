  "text": "Popular restaurant shutting its doors in Melbourne\nPopular for its Sunday brunch and Key West vibe, the Alligator Reef Club in downtown Melbourne will be closing its doors. The restaurant owners said they've sold their downtown property to a restaurant group.\n\"This is a bittersweet message we are sending today,\" the owners wrote in a social media post. \"We have so enjoyed the past two years of creating an inviting ambiance and menu experience for you to enjoy.\n\"We have made the decision to sell our unique property in Downtown Melbourne to a well-known restaurant group that plans to bring a new dining experience to our area.\"\nNo further details about the restaurant group or what's being planned for the 529 E. New Haven Ave. location were immediately available. The Alligator Reef Club served lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch, craft cocktails and more — they frequently had live music in the backdrop.\nThe restaurant will remain open until February 5, and all patrons are invited to a special celebration from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on February 1, including live music with food and drink specials.\nWe asked readers on FLORIDA TODAY's Facebook page, 321 Flavor: Where Brevard Eats, to weigh in on the news.\nDenise Mackey Cherne wrote, \"I loved it there. They had unique cocktails, good food and a great ambience. I am sad to hear this news.\"\n\"Alligator Reef has one of the coolest locations, in my opinion. Very relaxed atmosphere, great drinks and food too!\" wrote Michelle Hill Allender.\nDana Ott wrote, \"Alligator Reef is a beautiful venue, in and outside. The dining options were a perfect compliment to the tropical surroundings. It was a great place to transport us to the 'Keys.' Alligator Reef will be missed.\"\nAmber Olesen is FLORIDA TODAY's food and dining reporter. Reach her at aolesen@floridatoday.com.",
