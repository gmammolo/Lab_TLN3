  "text": "These 49 ridiculous workplace bonuses prove that some companies would rather gift employees anything—except actual money.\n“Employee Appreciation Day”\n“Our local Walmart decided to show their appreciation for the hard work working employees who tirelessly work themselves to ensure that the shelves are stocked for customers.”\n“This Will Cover My Rising Rent”\n“What My School Gave Its Teachers For Teacher Appreciation Week”\n“10 Year Symbol: Represents Durability And Flexibility. My Wife Got This From Work, She’s Been There 19 Years. They Gave This And A Bunch Of Other Random Stuff”\n“Congrats On 35 Years For The Company! Here Is 12 Donuts”\n“It’s kinda sad honestly after 35 years they think 12 donuts is good enough.”\n“For Christmas 2019, My Boss Gifted Us With 1 Work From Home Day In 2020”\n“My Wife’s Teacher Appreciation Gift From The Administrators Who Have Let Everyone Know All Year They Do Not Appreciate Them At All”\n“Little “Gift” My Wife Got One Year”\n“Here’s A New One. If Our Store Makes The Most Sales Competitively We Earn A Pizza Party Not For Ourselves But For Our Bosses”\n“Company Gave Employees Cookies To Celebrate $10 Billion In Profits”\n“Give the workers an extra day of PTO a year, or a raise, or working technology? Nah, how about COOKIES???”\n“Getting This As A Teacher Is Degrading. If You Want To Show Us Appreciation, Then Pay Us!”\n“These Are Trying Times With High Inflation, Better Bust The Sticker Budget”\n“The Bring Your Own Potato Bar Hosted By My School For Teacher Appreciation”\n“2 Billion In Gross Profit”\n“The Warehouse I Work At Was #1 In The Company For The 1st Quarter, Management Promised A Huge Reward, This Was It”\n“The GM of the warehouse kept going on and on about how glad he was that we hit #1 because he’d be getting a bonus check “just in time for the warmer weather.” Also a few suits from corporate came in to “personally and individually thank each of us” and needless to say they neither talked to nor thanked nobody.”\n“Our Work Christmas Bonus. Can’t Wait To Pay My Bills With This”\n“My Friend Got A “Gift” From Work. Chappy New Year”\n“After A Year Nurse Shortages, Running Out Of PPE, Working Employees To The Bone Without Hazard Pay, This Is The Meal My Wife’s Hospital Had The Audacity To Serve For Nurse’s Appreciation Week”\n“No Money Reward, No Time Off, Just Meaningless Things”\n“I Work At A Prison That Is Terribly Short Staffed, 12 Hour Overtime Shifts Are Mandated, And We’ve Just Been Informed That We Won’t Be Getting A Yearly Raise For Cost Of Living/Inflation. This Is Our “Mental Health Awareness Month” Gift”\n“Genuinely Ready To Quit! This Was My Bonus For Making The Company $85,000 In February”\n“They gave me rainbow earphones because I’m part of the LGBT community. The earphones cost $2 on Amazon and didn’t work. This is a Fortune 50 company. I make gross $45,000 a year.”\n“A Competing Company Is Offering Us 20 Percent More To Work For Them. Management’s Response”\n“My Company Has Given Each Employee 1-2 Bottles Of Expired Hand Sanitizer For “Employee Appreciation Day” 3 Years In A Row. Guess They Had Some Left Over From The Lockdowns”\n“My husband works in HAZMAT. He’s 100% sure it’s because bulk disposal of 70% iso is too expensive, so they’d rather disperse it to staff and make us get rid of it for them.\nIt smells horrible and I almost never use hand sanitizer when soap and water is available.”\n“After 10 Years At Her Job She Got A Pay Rate Increase, I Don’t Know What We’re Are Going To Do With All This Extra Cash”\n“Last Week Boss Overhears Us Complaining About No Raises, This Week Everyone Get Cookies”\n“My Girlfriend’s Boss Handed This To Her In Her Office Saying, “These Are Being Handed Out From The Company.” I’m Not Sure If This Is A Christmas Gift. What Do You All Think?”\n“This Snow Reminded Me Of That Time When My Employer Asked Us To Work In -40 Weather. Our Reward? A Hat”\n“The hat reads “40 Below Survivor 2019″ which s#cks for a couple of reasons. 1. People literally could not make it in, and I had a number of factors that allowed me to do so and 2. It wasn’t at our facility, but another employee of the company actually died in the snow. Your job doesn’t care about you. Stay warm and stay safe.”\n“A Gift From Work… To Motivate, Validate Our Efforts. They Ordered 100’s”\n“Today Is Teacher Appreciation Day.

This Was Our Reward For It”\n“Love How I Get This After Spending 5 Years At A Job”\n“First Day Of Teacher Appreciation Week. This Was Our Gift Bag Given To Us By Administration”\n“Check Out My Christmas Bonus After Making My Company $1 Million In The Last 2 Months Alone. $25 Card”\n“This So What We Got After “Breaking Records” For The Company”\n“I See Your Fancy Lindor Treats And Raise You The 6 Individually Wrapped Lifesavers I Received From Work”\n“Spencer’s Gifts Sending Literal Bricks To Employees As A “Thank You””\n“My Company’s “Appreciation Gift” For Breaking Company Q2 And 1h Records”\n“FedEx Showed Its Appreciation For Its Essential Employees With This.

I’ve been asking, applying, and almost begging to do anything in this org that will give me a raise to take care of responsibilities – I got a Welch’s fruit snack.”\n“Bonus? Nope! Raise? Nope”\n“But thank you master for my non-delux chicken sandwich, provided because labor inspectors are here.”\nCredits: www.boredpanda.com",
