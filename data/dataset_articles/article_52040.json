  "text": "Shemar Moore and Jesiree Dizon Split After Almost 5 Years Together\nShemar Moore, Jesiree Dizon Call It Quits ... After Almost 5 Years!!!\nShemar Moore and Jesiree Dizon have gone their separate ways ... the \"S.W.A.T\" star and the model are no longer a couple ... TMZ has learned.\nSources close to the former couple tell TMZ ... Shemar and his girlfriend split recently, but have remained cordial in the aftermath of the breakup.\nWe're told the two still, and always will be, loving friends and co-parents ... as they're committed to raising their daughter, Frankie Melelina Kapule Moore, together.\nSources say both Shemar and Jesiree are determined to give young Frankie the happiest and healthiest life possible.\nThis relationship update comes nearly a week after Shemar indicated on \"The Jennifer Hudson Show\" that he had no interest in having another child anytime soon.\nAs the 54-year-old told host Jennifer Hudson at the time, he felt his home was \"full\" and noted he wanted \"to give it all to my baby girl\" moving forward.\nShemar and Jesiree actually have a lengthy history together, first dating all the way back in 2008 ... but the pair split when SM wasn't quite ready to settle down. Jesiree is also a mom to kids Charli and Kaiden, who she welcomed in prior relationships.\nHowever, the twosome reconnected in 2020, after Shemar lost his mother, Marilyn.\nThe couple then went on to welcome their daughter Frankie, who was born in January 2023.\nBoth Shemar and Jesiree documented intimate aspects of their home life together, which seemed to be very happy ... that is until recently.",
