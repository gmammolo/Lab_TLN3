  "text": "NCIS has been a cornerstone of crime procedural television and has reigned for over two decades. It’s loved for the compelling cases, great characters, and storytelling. Thanks to their devoted fanbase, the show has constantly ranked as one of the most-watched series worldwide.\nA still from Gut Punch (episode) | NCIS | CBS But even NCIS , which has such a great track record isn’t immune to occasional mishaps. Most long-running shows have their highs and lows and give their fans a lot of memorable moments. But at times, they also feature episodes that leave the audience, confused, or even disappointed.\nNCIS season 22’s Out of Control episode backlash for its missteps A still from Out of Control (episode) | NCIS | CBS In the 22nd season of NCIS , Out of Control was one episode that was targeted by critics for its plot’s pacing, weird character decisions, and failed execution. When people tune in to watch the show, they expect a level of intrigue, and a character-driven story, which has been their formula for years.\nAudiences were disappointed because the case did not feel gripping, and it seemed like they gave no thought to the episode. The storyline was way below expectations and didn’t match the high standard set by NCIS.\nRelated “I have just seen more and more positive reactions”: NCIS Star Who Replaced Cote De Pablo Claimed Even Hardcore Ziva Fans Have Welcomed Her But of all, people were let down due to the way the showrunners portrayed some long-standing characters. This left a bitter taste in the viewers’ mouths, who found everything to be frustrating. But despite all these problematic issues, Out of Control has an IMDB rating of 7.4, so it still wasn’t as bad as the worst-rated episodes.\nFirst Steps and Gut Punch: Two bottom-of-the-barrel episodes on NCIS A still from First Steps (episode) | NCIS | Credit: CBS Out of Control was indeed a disappointment, but First Steps and Gut Punch are two episodes that are at the very end of NCIS rankings as per ratings on IMDB , with 6.9 for both. These episodes are so bad that no one bothered to judge or actively dislike them because they were simply that forgettable!\nFirst Steps was an attempt to bring forth an emotionally charged narrative but they faltered in the execution which felt forced and unnatural. Moreover, the whole case felt rushed and did not make sense to the viewers. By the end, fans were left unimpressed because the plot had genuine potential but it turned out to be a misfire.\nRelated 5 Most Underrated Episodes of NCIS: Los Angeles Gave Wrestling Fans a Major Surprise by Casting Famous WWE Icon Who Also Appeared in the Flash Gut Punch was even more disastrous as it tried to address real-world issues but it simply did not align with the usual tone of the show. To many, it felt like a filler episode, and the main team members being sidelined did not help either. Longtime fans who tuned in to watch some action were stuck and had to sit through someone enforcing pandemic protocols.\nYou can watch NCIS on Paramount+ .",
