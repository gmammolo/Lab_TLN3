Show Him How Happy You are\nEven if your ex boyfriend has moved on from you, it's still hurt to see that you're happy. Nobody knows whether he still likes you or not.

Don't Backstab His Girlfriend\nRather than play fast, it's better to play safe. It's what you should do. Just because you run out of patient trying to break him up with his new girlfriend, you choose to take a shortcut and backstabbing his girlfriend.

They are easily attracted to something beautiful. Make yourself prettier by working out to shape your body, get a fresh haircut, and put on some make up. Do a little strong makeover unless he won't notice it.\n11. Don't Make It Too Obvious\nOnce again, don't make things too obvious. No need to beg him to break up with his girlfriend on talking ill about her all the time when you don't know her well. Instead of succeeding, it only makes him running away from you, closing your chance right away.\n12. Spread News Through His Friends\nMake sure you have changed for the better. Not only by appearance but also by attitude. Show him that you are more mature than you used to be, becoming someone that he wished back then. But let the news spread through his friends. It will make him curious and want to see you in person.\nThere are many other ways how to make your ex boyfriend dump his new girlfriend. But it's important for you to do it rightly. Don't create a scenario where you bashed your ex boyfriend or his new girlfriend. You have to be wise and remember that karma does exist. Ruining others' relationship do you no good.",
