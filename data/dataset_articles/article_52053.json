  "text": "i probably wouldnt have noticed without the article\nThis is such a waste of development time. I cant even see a difference to the current ones. In case of doubt the old ones are always better.\nCobra shot is the ability that needs fixing.Either the animated projectile speed or its actual time to hit its mark reeally feels so slow. Its like archery in ES:Oblivion, the projectile animation (or time to hit) feels more like a weak throw, not a powerful shot.The _feeling_ of casting Cobra shot is more like how throwing the Wildfire Bombs should be, not a charged projectile.\noh yeah more annoying, ugly, unnecessary visual clutter\nSure, they're at work proved.\nWhy is every wowhead comment section full with people who hate the game? I mean no one is forcing you to play, if you don't enjoy it you can always leave ffs.\nYou know what I'd love for articles about new visuals? A comparison to the current/old visual.\nthanks for mentioning exactly what the update was on some of these because I would struggle to figure it out alongside the \"spirit wolf now scales with the player model and is more transparent\" zero visual change update.\nthey also updated Bestial Wrath to be more defined too, like the warrior enrage.\nIt's noticable that these preview videos are usually being done with furry races. I think personal preferences should play less of a role and perhaps races that don't have excessively unique skeletons would be a better choice.Also not having a comparison to old animations (albeit in this case, there isn't really an old animation) is an odd choice.\nOn the back of the character you can see a new animation of the sprint. This should be standard for the Hunter as well as the Rogue and Druid.\nwow is saved !\nI played on the PTR for a while and while the changes are subtle the new animations just feel increadibly smooth and nice. It's hard to explain. I think pets have better attack animations too and the way pets are summoned (like Dire Beast) looks really good now.Each individual change is not much but put together it makes a big difference IMO.\nThey also need to do a visual update on Aimed Shot and Rapid Fire with the new reworked MM Hunter\nDont see much difference exept Barbed Shot\nIn the meantime, I only hope that one day glyphs will arrive to allow me to play a low fantasy hunter who shoots bullets... only bullets.I play a dwarf mountaineer from Ironforge: why do I have to shoot purple magic bullets, or snakes? SNAKES!I beg you Blizzard, give us glyphs to play simple characters.\nCan we get some updated idle animations for guns and crossbows?\nIs there even a difference?",
