  "text": "D.C. air collision leads to travel delays at Bradley Airport\nWINDSOR LOCKS, CT (WGGB/WSHM) - Flights have resumed at Reagan National Airport after a midair collision between an Army helicopter and an American Airlines flight from Kansas killed all 67 people aboard the two aircraft.\nOne air traveler, who returned to Bradley International Airport from Washington D.C. on Thursday, told us his flight arrived at Reagan National Airport Wednesday night, just minutes before hearing the news about the deadly crash. “It was just an eerie, eerie, silence…something that just hits you hard when you see it,” said Andy Skarzynski.\nSkarzynski arrived at Reagan National Airport on an American Airlines flight less than an hour before the crash. “Landed about [8:10], we were looking forward to a quick flight home and then we started getting word that flights were being cancelled and then, as I looked up, we saw the news being played across multiple TVs across the airport,” he added.\nHe explained what conditions were like inside Reagan National Airport shortly after the fatal accident. “As the commotion was happening, there was an odd silence and yet, an interesting amount of hustle and bustle of people trying to rapidly make changes for their transportation home,” Skarzynski explained.\nSkarzynski told us his flight back home to Connecticut was ultimately cancelled, which led him to drive back. The trip lasted over ten hours and he told us, despite being so close to tragedy, travelers inside Reagan National Airport Wednesday night showed up to help one another. “You could see the sadness in everyone’s faces and the concern everyone had and yet, within all of that, within the same time all of this is occurring, it was amazing to see people working together and communicating with each other…People who didn’t know each other saying ‘Do you need a ride here? Can I help you get home,’” Skarzynski said.\nCopyright 2025. Western Mass News (WGGB/WSHM). All rights reserved.",
