  "text": "Insidious, the hit horror franchise created by genre visionaries James Wan and Leigh Whannell, was set to deliver its sixth entry in August 2025. However, we now have some bad news, as Sony Pictures Releasing has decided to push back Insidious 6 (there’s still no official title) by a whole year. The latest Insidious movie will now be released on August 21, 2026. According to Deadline, execs at Sony Pictures has now pushed the latest Insidious film to 2026 in the hopes of putting a more promising feature in its spot. Thus, they're replacing Insidious 6 with Caught Stealing, the crime thriller directed by Darren Aronofsky and based on the book of the same name by Charlie Huston. The movie stars Austin Butler, Zoë Kravitz, Matt Smith, Regina King, Liev Schreiber, Bad Bunny, and Vincent D'Onofrio, among others.\nCaught Stealing follows former baseball player Hank Thompson as he falls into the criminal underworld of 1990s New York City. A funny irony in this release date swap is that the adaptation has been in development since 2013, and Insidious star Patrick Wilson was initially in line for the lead role. That project got stuck in development hell and was eventually scrapped. Although Sony Pictures has decided to keep Insidious 6 on their roster (the movie will be released through one of their companies, Screen Gems), the project is still shrouded in complete mystery. It's apparently still in pre-production, and only producers have been confirmed (the usual suspects include Jason Blum, Oren Peli, and others). There's currently no writer, director, or cast for Insidious 6.\nThis disappointing news of Insidious 6's delay was announced the very same day that the franchise was all over the media, albeit not for one of its films. Insidious: The Further You Fear is a live immersive horror experience based on the franchise that was touring the country. After a few performances, reviews were so bad that the show was unceremoniously canceled. It's not that one should associate this kind of failure with Sony Pictures reorganizing their schedule, but it's a bit suspicious.\nA Horror Franchise That Refuses to End\nSure, movies are pushed back, and immersive experiences are canceled, but that doesn't mean the Insidious franchise is nearing its demise. There's still potential here, and proof of that was the last entry released in 2023. Insidious: The Red Door is actually a pretty scary film directed by franchise star Patrick Wilson (in his feature directorial debut) that managed to tackle the original themes and continue the story of the Lambert family that had come to a halt with Insidious: Chapter 2.\nRelated\n10 Movies to Watch If You Loved Insidious: The Red Door\nThe newest installment in the Insidious franchise is making headlines at the box office. Here are some films you should pair with it.\nAfter Insidious: Chapter 2, the franchise continued with prequels that still made a lot of money at the box office and proved the value of Leigh Whannell's scripts (he has written every installment except for The Red Door). So, if you come to think about it, there's a reason why the Insidious franchise refuses to die. All the movies have made over $730 million from a combined production budget of less than $50 million. It's one of Blumhouse Productions' most important and successful IPs, and no doubt there will be much more to come after Insidious 6 hits theaters in 2026.\nYour comment has not been saved\nInsidious: The Red Door\n- Release Date\n- July 7, 2023\n- Director\n-\nPatrick Wilson - Writers\n-\nPatrick Wilson - Franchise(s)\n-\nInsidious",
