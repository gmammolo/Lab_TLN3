  "text": "Tonsils can grow back after they’ve been removed – here’s which other body parts can regenerate\nThe human body is composed of over 37 trillion cells, each with a limited lifespan. These cells are continuously replaced to maintain organ and system function. Yet over time, or as a result of damage, the number of functioning cells can decrease to a level that causes symptoms or even organ failure.\nRegeneration of organs and systems is a scientific holy grail that relies on stem cells, but due to their limited number and slow division rate, this isn’t a practical route to organ regeneration . It would take many years to repopulate all the cell types needed.",
