  "text": "MultiVersus could be coming to an end. A new rumor from known MultiVersus leaker AusilMV suggests that the game’s upcoming Season 5 could be the last one.\n“[MultiVersus] Season 5 may be the final season of MultiVersus, depending on how it performs,” they said while prefacing that this isn’t confirmed yet.. “A notable source shared this rumor with me, stating that Season 5 may be a “last-ditch effort” for the game.”\nInsider Gaming has reached out Warner Bros. Games and developer Player First Games for comment on the rumor. Should a response be received, it will be amended to this story.\nRELATED: Year In Review—MultiVersus Had it All And Threw it Away\nThe idea that MultiVersus could be heading towards a tipping point shouldn’t come as much of a surprise to players and outsiders alike. Since the game launched with high player numbers nearly three years ago, its popularity has dwindled. The game saw a peak player count on Steam of 153,433 players before it fell by 99% within its first few months.\nAfter it struggled to regain traction, Warner Bros. Games announced it was taking the game down in June 2023 after what it then started to call an “open beta” period. It was re-released in May 2024 with numerous updates and changes in the months since. However, it has yet to return to the numbers it had when it first launched and the hype from players was there.\nMultiVersus Season 5 is scheduled to start in early February. It’ll be interesting to see what the developers have planned to try and get players to not only pick up their game, but stick around after.\nWhat do you make of the rumors that Season 5 could be MultiVersus’ last? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.\nFor more Insider Gaming, check out the free games coming to PlayStation Plus members in February and and check out the leaked new expansion pack for The Sims 4.
