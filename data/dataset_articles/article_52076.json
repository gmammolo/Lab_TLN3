  "text": "V8 power is reportedly set for the scrapheap for the successor to today's Audi RS6 and RS7 performance cars in favour of high-output, downsized hybrid tech.\nAlex Misoyannis 08:00 31 January 2025 0 comments\n+ 8 Photos + 8 Photos Previous Next The Audi RS7 liftback and wagon – this year's reshuffled replacement for today's petrol RS6 and RS7 models – will reportedly swap their V8s for downsized V6 hybrid power.\nBut the UK's Car magazine reports that despite smaller engines, the addition of electric motors will boost power to about 541kW (725 horsepower) – up from 463kW in today's RS6 and RS7 V8s.\nIf the report – which contrasts earlier expectations – is accurate, the V6 would be the first engine ever fitted Audi's flagship low-slung performance cars with fewer than eight cylinders, after one V10 and three V8 generations since the first RS6 in 2002.\nMORE: Next-gen Audi RS7 likely to retain petrol V8 power, but with a hybrid twist (published July 2024)\n+ 8 Photos + 8 Photos + 8 Photos Previous Next Car reports Audi is developing a new V6 plug-in hybrid system set to be shared by its next-generation BMW M3 and M5 competitors, the RS5 and RS7, each available as a liftback and wagon.\nThey align with Audi's latest naming structure, which sees petrol-powered models given odd-numbered badges, and electric cars even numbers. A new RS6 is in development, but it will be electric.\nThe UK publication claims the V6 will produce identical power in both models, and differentiation will instead come from different electric motor outputs.\nCiting unnamed internal sources, it claims the RS5 will develop \"around\" 600 horsepower (447kW), while the RS7 will reportedly develop \"around\" 725 horsepower (541kW) – both with a 'Boost' mode unlocking 50 horsepower (37kW) in short bursts.\nMORE: 2024 Audi RS6 GT unveiled as likely last of the non-hybrid V8s, coming to Australia\n+ 8 Photos Audi RS4 V6 engine. The new models are up significantly on the 331kW/600Nm of the 2.9-litre twin-turbo, non-hybrid V6 in today's RS4 and RS5, and the 463kW/850Nm of the 4.0-litre twin-turbo, mild-hybrid V8 in the current RS6 and RS7 Performance.\nCar claims more powerful Performance versions will follow with as much as 800 horsepower (597kW).\nIt remains to be seen how much quicker the new models are than their predecessors, given the electrified boost will likely come with a substantial increase in weight from the electric motor and battery.\nAudi quotes zero to 100km/h times of 3.9 seconds for the current RS4 Avant Competition Plus wagon, and 3.4 seconds for the current RS6 Avant Performance wagon.\n+ 8 Photos + 8 Photos Previous Next Outgoing Audi RS6 Avant V8. A move to hybrid V6 power – likely based on the current 2.9-litre twin-turbo unit – will see Audi's performance cars line up against new rivals from BMW and Mercedes-AMG .\nThe latest BMW M5 is available as a sedan and wagon with a 535kW twin-turbo V8 hybrid system, while the smaller M3 remains available with 3.0-litre non-hybrid, twin-turbo inline six-cylinder power.\nMercedes-AMG has moved to 500kW turbo four-cylinder plug-in hybrid power for its latest C63 , and larger models have adopted twin-turbo V8 hybrid propulsion with up to 600kW.\nAlongside the new RS7 hybrid, Car reports an electric RS6 e-tron is also due in 2025 with 470kW from dual motors and all-wheel drive.\n8 Images Previous Next MORE: Audi Showroom MORE: Audi News MORE: Audi Reviews MORE: Audi RS7 Showroom MORE: Audi RS7 News MORE: Audi RS7 Reviews MORE: Search Used Audi Cars for Sale MORE: Audi Showroom MORE: Audi News MORE: Audi Reviews MORE: Audi RS7 Showroom MORE: Audi RS7 News MORE: Audi RS7 Reviews MORE: Search Used Audi Cars for Sale Alex Misoyannis Deputy News Editor\nAlex Misoyannis has been writing about cars since 2017, when he started his own website, Redline.
