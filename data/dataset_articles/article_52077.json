  "text": "Tom McKibbin snubbed the advice of Rory Mcllroy after deciding to join Jon Rahm's Legion XIII LIV Golf team.\nOn Wednesday, it was confirmed the 22-year-old, who had earned a place on the PGA Tour this season, would be joining LIV Golf for the new LIV season, which begins in Saudi Arabia next week. And in moving to LIV, McKibbin will be teaming up with Rahm, Tyrrell Hatton and Caleb Surratt.\nMcKibbin came through Holywood Golf Club in Northern Ireland, the same club four-time major winner Mcllroy did. And in choosing to join the Saudi Arabian-backed breakaway league, McKibbin snubbed the advice of Mcllroy from earlier this month.\n\"As soon as he [McKibbin] got the offer, he rang me,\" McIlroy said at the Dubai Desert Classic. \"We had a really good conversation and I talked to him multiple times over the course of December to sort of get a feel for what he was thinking and basically what he was going to do. All I could do is give my perspective.\n\"I really like Tom as a person, as a player. I think he’s got a tonne of potential. I said to him: ‘If I were in your shoes, I would make a different choice than the one you’re thinking of making.’\n\"Working so hard to get your card in the States, something that he did, to achieve that goal last year was a big achievement. I think what he potentially is sacrificing and giving up with access to majors, potential Ryder Cup spot … I don’t think anything is official yet but if I were in his position and I had his potential, which I think I have been before, I wouldn’t make that decision.\nFollow us on Xfor the best and latest in sports news\n\"But I’m not him. I’m not in his shoes. He’s a grown man at this point and can make his own decisions. All I can do is try to give him my perspective.\n\"Personally for me it would be a little disappointing if it were to happen but I made it perfectly clear: ‘I am not going to stand in your way if you need to make the decision you feel like you need to make for yourself.’ But at the same time, I feel like he’s giving up a lot to not really benefit that much.\"\nWant to watch more live sports?
