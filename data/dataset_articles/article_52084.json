  "text": "Rachael Kirkconnell said she found out that her boyfriend of four years–Matt James—had broken up with her while she was on a flight.\nKirkconnell met James, 33 on season 25 of “The Bachelor,” and after a series of controversies, they decided to give their relationship another try in 2021.\nNearly two weeks after James announced their breakup in a cryptic Instagram post, Kirkconnell, 28, opened up about how she’s coping on the Call Her Daddy podcast .\nREAD ALSO: Detroit rapper files lawsuit against Lyft, alleging weight discrimination\nShe told host Alex Cooper, “Literally the plane is taking off and I see his post, and that’s it. I don’t have any service or anything for the next 12 hours, so I’m freaking out because, you know, just got broken up with, and now, a few hours later, it’s for the whole world to see and I’m still trying to process it.”\nShe confessed , “I’m still in total shock. I think that’s why I didn’t say anything. Still haven’t made a statement or anything because I’m processing this just like everyone else is.”\nJames’ Instagram announcement read: “Father God, give Rachael and I strength to mend our broken hearts. Give us a peace about this decision to end our relationship that transcends worldly understanding. Shower our friends and family with kindness and love to comfort us. And remind us that our Joy comes from you, Lord.”\nAccording to Kirkconnell, James posted about the breakup “two or three hours after” they privately called it quits while on a trip together in Tokyo . Their relationship had been strained leading up to the split, and they had been “butting heads” before a serious argument about compatibility and marriage.\nShe noted, “He said that at the end of the day there were just qualities about me that he worries about having in a wife. Like at the end of the day, there are things that we aren’t compatible with.”\nREAD ALSO: Skai Jackson’s baby daddy was in jail when she welcomed child, here’s what we know about his arrest\nShe further explained, “And yeah, it was just one of those things where he I think just had this realization that I should want to propose to you by this time. Like, at this point in our relationship, I should be wanting those things and I should be ready for that. But I’m not still, I still don’t feel like we’re ready or I don’t feel like I’m ready. I don’t know if I ever see myself proposing to you. I can’t actually see myself married to you. He said that, you know, maybe one day he would get there, but he doesn’t feel ready now.”\nKirkconnell said she had believed they were “on the same page, privately and publicly.” She also revealed that James had previously encouraged her to start saving and picking out engagement rings.\nIn the days following the split, Kirkconnell interacted with fan comments on social media, hinting that James had blindsided her. Though she said she has forgiven James, she believes he “disrespected” her by the way he handled the breakup.\nKirkconnell made her first public outing since the breakup when she was spotted at LAX by TMZ . She told the outlet she was “hanging in there” and added, “Things will start to come out and I’ll speak about it whenever I’m ready, but for now, I’m just protecting my peace.”\nShe however confirmed there was “no” infidelity and “no” chance of reconciliation. “No. Yeah, we’re out,” she stated.\nReflecting on their relationship , Kirkconnell admitted, “One day, I’m feeling kind of empowered and I’m like, ‘You know what? It’s OK. I’m excited to be on my own,’ and then the next day, I can barely get out of bed and I just miss him and I’m sad about everything, so yeah. Just comes and goes.”\nREAD ALSO: Rapper Sexyy Red apologizes to MLK’s daughter over ‘intentionally distasteful’ post",
