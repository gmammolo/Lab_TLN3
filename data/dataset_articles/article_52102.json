  "text": "Cardinals\nPrevious 5 Games\nAfter flying high against Denison last Friday, Melissa came back down to earth. The Melissa Cardinals fell 64-56 to the Lovejoy Leopards on Tuesday. The Cardinals' defeat signaled the end of their six-game winning streak.\nMelissa's loss ended a four-game streak of away wins and brought them to 16-12. As for Lovejoy, the win (which was their 11th in a row) raised their record to 24-5.\nMelissa and Lovejoy should be looking forward to their upcoming games as both have a sizable advantage in the MaxPreps Texas Rankings. Melissa will square off against McKinney North at 8:00 p.m. on Friday up 339 places (87 vs. 426). Melissa is looking to tack on another W to their four-game streak on the road. Meanwhile, Lovejoy (ranked 51st) will meet Greenville (ranked 616th) at 7:30 p.m. on Friday.\nArticle generated by infoSentience based on data entered on MaxPreps",
