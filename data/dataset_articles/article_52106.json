  "text": "Summary\n- Purchaser received a shabby PS4 box with a PS3 inside, not their PS5.\n- Advice for expensive buys: always film your unboxing.\n- Many concerned fans support the distressed gamer; some joke about the situation.\nAn Indian gamer that was eagerly expecting their delivery of a new PlayStation 5 received an extremely unfortunate surprise in its stead. The delivery has understandably upset the gamer, especially since they hadn't yet received a solution at the time of sharing their PlayStation 5 plight.\nDepite the fact that it came out back in 2020, some gamers still haven't moved on to the PlayStation 5. This is partially due to the cost, as well as some hesitating due to console exclusivity with certain games. Anyone buying a PlayStation 5 shouldn't have to deal with the scenario this player found themselves in.\nRelated\nRumor: Sony Canceled One PlayStation PC Port\nSony reportedly shelves a PC port of one of its popular PlayStation exclusives following an unspecified period of development.\nReddit user Imcheeku shared their experience with trying to buy a PlayStation 5 off of Amazon's India-region site. Their package arrived, but when they opened it, they quickly found a problem. Instead of a PlayStation 5 box, they found a severely battered PlayStation 4 box, which looks like it's barely being held together by messy tape. Unfortunately, their problem got worse. They arranged a return, and when the pick-up arrived, they opened the box to inspect the contents. Inside the half-destroyed PlayStation 4 box was a PlayStation 3 console. Due to the package not containing what it should have, the return was refused.\nPlayers Commiserate Over PlayStation 5 Mishap\nNobody wants to buy a game or console to not get the right thing, and fellow gamers are especially sympathetic that this player has been struggling to get their money back. Several have suggested that the fan reach out to a national consumer helpline, or Amazon India's grievance officer. Others suggested that when buying a high-cost item like this that it's a good idea to film the opening as proof, in case something goes wrong. Some also pointed out that this purchase doesn't seem to be from Amazon directly, and instead was made with a third-party seller that simply used Amazon as a platform.\nOf course, plenty of fans took the opportunity to joke about the unfortunate situation. Some mused that they should open up the PlayStation 3, suggesting that it might be PlayStation Inception, with PlayStation 2 hardware and a PlayStation 1 game disc inside the PS3 shell. Others criticized, wondering why the player hadn't noticed that they got the wrong box right off the bat. The OP noted that the PS4 box had been partially obscured by another box that contained some games and controllers, so they didn't know what they'd received until it was too late. With any luck, this gamer can get what they rightfully ordered, and this situation ironed out.",
