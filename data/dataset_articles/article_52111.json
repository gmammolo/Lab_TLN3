From gargling with salt water to sage tea, manuka honey and zinc... here are some handy ways to try prevent tonsil infection in the first place The tonsils are the first line of defence against bacteria which is airborne or present in foods, so taking steps to prevent the infection in the first place is a great place to start. Picture: PA Photo/thinkstockphotos\nSun, 02 Feb, 2025 - 07:36 Megan Sheppard I’ve been getting tonsillitis since my teens, mostly during the winter. Sometimes, gargling with water helps, but other times, I need an antibiotic. What can I do to ensure I don’t get the infection in the first place?\nThe tonsils are the first line of defence against bacteria which is airborne or present in foods, so taking steps to prevent the infection in the first place is a great place to start. The mineral zinc is one of the best preventative measures for any type of throat infection. Zinc, specifically in the form of Zinc gluconate, is particularly useful in dealing with throat and respiratory issues and can help prevent repeat bouts of tonsillitis.\nGetting zinc directly to the back of the throat where you need it is easily done by taking zinc lozenges. Zinc is an important mineral for immunity since the body secretes zinc into fluids as an antiseptic. It is worth noting that tea, coffee, and alcohol all reduce zinc levels in the body.\nManuka honey is another good standby. It has been used to treat infections of both viral and bacterial origin, including streptococcal and staphylococcal infections. Take a teaspoon of the honey and hold it in your mouth as close to the affected area as you can, for as long as possible, before swallowing.\nGargling with water may help with the discomfort but you will need to add salt to treat and prevent infection.\nSalt can not only help to soothe inflammation in the mouth and throat, but it can also reduce bad breath issues, treat and prevent bacterial infection in the mouth, and relieve oral pain. Sage tea (common garden sage — Salvia officinalis) is another effective natural remedy for strengthening your immune defences and addressing recurrent bouts of tonsillitis. Most people have it in their garden or kitchen cupboard. Simply use a teaspoon of dried or fresh sage per cup of boiling water and steep for three to five minutes. You can add honey to taste if you wish.\nMy energy often dips between three and four in the afternoon, and finishing my work can be a struggle. is there a remedy I could use?\nCoenzyme Q-10 (CoQ10) and Carnitine are supplements health professionals and gym enthusiasts use to support mitochondrial function. CoQ10 is a crucial component of mitochondrial function, converting the energy from fats and sugars into cellular energy.\nCoQ10 can help solve your afternoon energy dips by supporting your body at a cellular level. Carnitine supports the mitochondria by delivering essential fatty acids to be burned as fuel, which is why it has a reputation for increasing stamina and endurance, as well as being a powerful mood booster.\nIf you are after a quick fix, then you might like to consider the Amazonian herb Guarana (Paullinia cupana). Guarana can help reduce physical and mental fatigue as well as improve metabolism. It contains a unique combination of natural stimulants and other active ingredients — but it is worth noting that it does contain caffeine. Guarana, coffee, tea, and chocolate should all be avoided if you wish to avoid caffeine. It is worth noting that the recommended daily dosage of guarana contains less caffeine than an ordinary cup of black tea.\nMany energy products contain guarana. However, I recommend either finding natural guarana powder and making your own healthy bliss balls and smoothies or taking it in capsule form. This is especially important if you want to avoid the flavouring, sugar, colouring, and additional caffeine often added to energy drinks.\nOne other herbal remedy without caffeine may help you avoid the afternoon slump. Yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) is typically taken as a tea and is reputed to stimulate brain function without interfering with sleep, burdening the adrenal glands, or disrupting your nervous system. It has a slightly bitter flavour.\nRead More Natural Health: What can I do about my flaking scalp?\nIrish Examiner’s WhatsApp channel\nFollow and share the latest news and stories\nwith\nSubscribe Now",
