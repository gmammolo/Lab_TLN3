  "text": "Southern Charm's two new castmembers are spilling the sweet tea on their past plastic surgeries.\nSeason 10 newbies Molly O'Connell and Salley Carson have formed a bond over their many cosmetic procedures.\n\"Being a woman is so hard,\" Salley admitted while grabbing drinks with her costar during the Bravo series' Jan. 30 episode.. \"I'm sitting there getting my lips [done] today and my chin and I'm like, 'This hurts so f--king bad!'\"\nMolly echoed her costar, noting, \"I literally got chin filler two days ago. I did it here because I have a very short chin.\"\nBut a little filler is the least surprising nip/tuck Molly has on her list of past procedures. In fact, she's even had work done on her gums, as she added, \"I got my gums cut last year.\"\nThe Charleston locals went on to compare Botox stories, with Molly noting of her doctor, \"He put some in my jaw too. Like one of my jaws is gnarly and the other one's just like.\"\nIn a confessional, Molly explained her philosophy when it comes to going under the knife in order to keep up her appearance.\n\"I'm not trying to change how I look, I'm just trying to keep it somewhat stable,\" the former model shared. \"I wanna look a little younger than I actually am for as long as I can.\"\nAs for I think I started to do it because I was insecure, but then I realized it makes you feel good too. So, I'm gonna continue to do that.\nThen, Salley opened up about her plans to have her breast implants removed, which prompted Molly to make an unexpected confession about her own artificially enhanced boobs.\n\"These are fat transfer,\" she told Salley with a tap to her chest. A shocked Salley replied, \"I wanna see your boobs but I'm not gonna ask you to do that.\"\nAs for what Molly’s fat transfer entailed, she didn’t hold back in in her confessional.\n\"My ankles were a little thicker than your average person,\" she recounted. \"I was always a bit bothered by it. So, finally I got ankle and calf liposuction and then I shot the fat into my boobs because I had no boobies.\"\nAnd she's extremely happy with the results.\n\"People are not giving me bad feedback,\" she told Salley. \"Guys are saying 'you look great.'\"\nKeep reading to see more celebrities who have gotten candid about going under the knife or embracing cosmetic procedures.\nSouthern Charm airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. on Bravo.\n(E! and Bravo are both part of the NBCUniversal family)\nCheck out Peacock to binge your favorite NBCU TV shows and movies, live sports and more!",
