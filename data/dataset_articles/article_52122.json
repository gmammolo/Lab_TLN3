  "text": "Danish dairy cooperative Arla Foods has confirmed it will withdraw its Jörd plant-based milk brand from UK retail stores and focus on the food service sector. The company first introduced Jörd in 2020 as its entry into the plant-based beverage market.\n“We are constantly looking for ways to drive the greatest value for our farmer owners”\nArla has not provided specific reasons for the withdrawal, but industry analysts point to the competitive nature of the UK alt-milk market . The range has already been removed from major supermarket chains, including Tesco , Asda , and Sainsbury’s . While Jörd-branded products will no longer be available to UK consumers in retail, a Barista version of the oat-based drink will remain accessible to food service providers, though it will not carry the Jörd branding.\n“As a cooperative, we are constantly looking for ways to drive the greatest value for our farmer-owners, and we have made the decision to make a strategic shift and refocus the Arla Jörd product range for the food service channel. This means that we will no longer offer Arla Jörd as a retail product in the UK,” an Arla spokesperson said in a statement to Just Food .\nThe Jörd brand will continue to be available in both retail and food service channels in Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands.\n© Arla Foods Jörd was initially launched with three oat-based beverages—Oat, Oat & Hemp, and Oat & Barley—and later underwent a rebranding in early 2024 to align more closely with Arla’s broader product portfolio. The revised lineup featured new packaging and a reformulated recipe, but only the Barista variant will remain, unbranded and limited to food service channels.\nIndustry reactions The discontinuation of Jörd in UK retail comes as Arla navigates broader market trends. Henrik Lund, CEO of Danish plant-based food company Naturli’ Foods, commented on LinkedIn that Arla’s decision reflects consumer concerns over pricing in the plant-based sector.\n“Arla’s U-turn is based, according to themselves, on the fact that consumers think that plant-based drinks are too expensive and can only be sold on a discounted basis – one wonders if this is not something Arla has extensive experience with?” he stated. Lund further noted that Arla’s Lurpak butter brand has also been subject to steep discounts in Denmark.\nArla recorded revenue of €6.6 billion ($6.87 billion) in the first half of 2024, a 6.5% decline from the previous year, though EBITDA rose from €399 million to €512 million. On its website, the company noted its continued commitment to plant-based alternatives, stating, “We firmly believe that there is still an opportunity with our brands to offer new plant-based alternatives alongside dairy. Please look out for our new innovations launching in 2025.”",
