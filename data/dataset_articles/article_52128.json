  "text": "Justin’s ‘deep concern’ for being in public is the fault of his worrying appearance in New York City this week, which exacerbated even more the growing fears for their well -being, experts have affirmed.\nThe 30 -year -old singer seemed uncomfortable with a baggy yellow sweatshirt and poorly tight beige pants during a Manhattan excursion on Wednesday.\nThe images arrive in the midst of reports that their “unacceptable” behavior has exercised tension in their marriage to his wife Hailey, 28, who is said to be in a constant battle with her husband for her refusal to listen to her concerns about he.\nNow, experts have told Dailymail.com that his tired figure is the result of becoming ‘limit solcole’ after fighting with the idea of ​​large crowds or mixing with strangers after years of being in the center of attention.\n“Justin has been fighting in recent years and an important part of that is due to his concern to be in certain public situations,” said a source.\n‘It has increased a deep fear of being in spaces with many people and has a deeply rooted concern for large crowds.\nJustin’s ‘deep concern’ for being in public is to blame for his worrying appearance in New York City this week, insiders have told Dailymail.com\nThe images arrive in the midst of reports that his “unacceptable” behavior has pressed his marriage to Hailey, who is desperate for he heard his concerns about him.\n‘That is one of the reasons why he has not made any tour for a while.\n“Justin focused on trying to heal and improve himself to staying away from too many exits away from his homes, where he would have to mix with strangers, and that in turn has made it solo sometimes.”\nHis fears have affected Hailey, who has desperately trying to encourage him to overcome his concerns, with the source claiming that his recent trip to Aspen was his attempt to help him relieve him in public life.\nThey added that their extreme wealth and excessive fame have given him the ability not to have to leave his home.\n“The cost of being locked in the world is also hard,” they said. ‘It is difficult for a couple, like Hailey, who supports and wants to help him overcome these moments.\n“His recent trip to Aspen is an example of how he is encouraging him in public with close friends.”\nThey suggested that their lonely behavior is also connected to becoming a father for the first time.\nThe baby singer welcomed his son Jack with Hailey in August.\n“It has increased a deep fear of being in spaces with many people and has a deep concern for large crowds,” said the source.\nThe 30 -year -old singer seemed uncomfortable with a baggy yellow sweatshirt and poorly tight beige pants during a Manhattan excursion on Wednesday\n“He loves being at home with Jack, which affects his desire to return to work, although he has mentioned that he wants to record, the tours are a difficult question at this time,” said the source.\n‘Hailey has faced the same struggles as many new mothers too. She has her world overturned and that has meant some changes and time to adapt. It has been a challenging moment for her too.\nJustin’s health speculation gained traction following Diddy’s arrest last year. His previously close link with the dishonored rapper, the real name Sean combs, was under intense scrutiny, with fans quickly to comment on his ‘thin’ appearance.\nThe sources at that time told Dailymail.com that the combination of the consequences of Diddy’s arrest and that Justin’s new role as the first time had left him “stressed.”\nSoon the speculation of agitation between Justin and Hailey followed, which was further promoted this month when fans noticed that he no longer followed his father -in -law Stephen Baldwin on Instagram.\nDays later, he caused concern about his use of marijuana when he shared a photo of himself using a Bong, shortly before he stopped following Hailey on social networks.\nHe quickly said he had been “pirated” and dedicated himself to discarding claims of problems by publishing an image of his super model wife of his recent vacations in Aspen, Colorado, where he seemed to be recording new music.\n“Someone went to my account and stopped following my wife,” he wrote in a statement shared to his stories. ‘S *** get Soss here’.\nHis fears have affected Hailey, who has desperately trying to encourage him to overcome his concerns (in the photo together in 2024)\nThe founder of Rhode Beauty, Hailey, also seemed to control damage by sharing a photo of a sleeping Justin.\nThe musician also raised his eyebrows when he stopped following several notable names, including his mentor Usher, his former manager Braun and Ryan Good, who was the best man at his wedding, which caused speculation that he was trying to spill people from his past while focusing on new music.\nFans declared that the musician is in ‘self -destructive’ mode after the publication of the photos of the photos in their week.\nIt looks 40 years. This young man needs help. Help serious, ” a person wrote. ‘Something is eating him. It is not a sign of weakness to ask for help. He has a child to raise.\n“Too much luggage from his past, too many wolves around him when he was young,” another wrote. “We all know, and I hope it can do it.”\n‘My heart breaks for Justin … He is really self -destructive in front of our eyes,’ added a third.\nJustin has fought for the years to be in public and deal with the intense fame that was discovered by Scooter Braun as a child.\nHe signed his first record contract with RBMG the year he turned 14 and became a global superstar when he crushed the albums with the launch of his debut album, My World 2.0, two years later.\nIn 2018, a source told Us Weekly: ‘Justin has become an inmate and a person changed.\n‘He has no interest in being a celebrity and an artist.\n‘He has retired again, just as he did a couple of years ago. He started recording music, but stopped.\nJustin opened on the traps of fame, claiming that he was close to letting “destroy me completely” during an interview with Billboard in 2015.\n(Tagstotranslate) Dailymail (T) TvShowbiz",
