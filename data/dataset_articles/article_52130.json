  "text": "Hillgrove has been a dominant force so far, but they're in the middle of a mini-slump at the moment. They came up short against the McEachern Indians on Friday, falling 67-43. While losing is never fun, the Hawks can't take it too hard given the team's big disadvantage in MaxPreps' Georgia basketball rankings (they are ranked 40th, while the Indians are ranked third).\nTaRenz Collins\nPoints (Career)\nHillgrove's loss came despite strong showings from Jaden Johnson and TaRenz Collins. Johnson posted ten points, while Collins scored nine points. Those nine points gave Collins a new career-high.\nEven though they lost, Hillgrove smashed the offensive glass and finished the game with 15 offensive boards. That strong performance was nothing new for the team: they've now pulled down at least eight offensive rebounds in six consecutive matches.\nHillgrove's defeat dropped their record down to 15-6. As for McEachern, the win was the seventh in a row for them, bringing their record for this year to 17-3.\nHillgrove wasted no time getting back out on the court and has already played their next contest, a 64-60 victory against Harrison on the 28th. As for McEachern, they also didn't take long to hit the court again: they've already played their next game, a 55-45 win against Norcross on the 25th.\nArticle generated by infoSentience based on data entered on MaxPreps",
