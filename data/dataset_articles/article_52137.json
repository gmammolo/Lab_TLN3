  "text": "Barbara ascended to heaven on Monday, January 27 from the home in Murfreesboro, Tennessee she shared with her loving and devoted husband of 56 years, Bob. She is also survived by her children, Bryon (Liz) and Lisa, adored grandchildren Bryce, Carly and Emma, sister Beth (Tom) Blews, and numerous nieces, nephews, and cousins throughout Ohio and Pennsylvania.\nBarbara loved her husband, family and friends immensely. The daughter of Ivy and Ken Davies, Barbara grew up in Youngstown, Ohio and graduated from Boardman High School where she was active in chorus and Masonic Rainbow Drill Team. She led the team- which included her sister- as a Captain, State Champion, and Advisor. Barbara met Bob at US Steel and married in 1968, raising their family in Boardman. Barbara’s priority was always her family which led to her committed involvement in all the things that interested her husband and children, including baseball and dance.\nThe family would like to thank the numerous friends and neighbors for their generosity, support and selflessness during this most difficult time. The meals, notes, phone calls, texts have been a sustaining gift. Also to be mentioned, our gratitude to the staff at the office of Dr. Michael Kellogg, Amedisys Home Health and Hospice- Melanie, Tascha and Josh, as well as friend, Spice.\nCremation arrangements are under the direction of Woodfin Funeral Chapels and an online\nguestbook is available for the Martin family at www.woodfinchapel.com.",
