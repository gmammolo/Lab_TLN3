  "text": "In an unprecedented legal case, a UK woman has been found guilty of 'cyber-farting' after sending distressing flatulence videos over Christmas. Rhiannon Evans, 25, is believed to be the first person ever prosecuted for such an offense after her actions allegedly caused anxiety and distress to recipient Deborah Prytherech.As per reports from the Metro, Evans had sent three videos on December 22 and four more over the next few days, including on Boxing Day and New Year’s Day. After the incident was reported to the police, Evans was arrested at her home.Evans' defense attorney, Harriet Gorst, argued that the incident stemmed from ongoing tensions between Evans’ partner and Prytherech over child contact. She explained that Evans had been drinking at the time and did not intend to cause harm, acknowledging that her actions had since distressed the victim. However, the prosecution challenged this claim, with Diane Williams asserting that the act was purely malicious. “She was smirking throughout, found it hilarious—but the victim didn’t,” Williams stated. 117744542Rhiannon Evans was fined nearly £300 and sentenced to a 12-month community order. The court also imposed a two-year restraining order, requiring her to attend 15 rehabilitation sessions and abstain from alcohol for 60 days. In a victim statement, Deborah said that she would ‘would like to feel safe in my home’.The bizarre case has captured the attention of netizens, sparking a wave of reactions online. Many have expressed shock and amusement over the unusual charges. One user commented, “Cyber-farting?! Now that's a term I want to see put in the legal books. There's is a whole new legal industry blowing up (pun intended). What's your specialty young man? Admiralty law? Torts? 'I handle Cyber-farting cases but only of the two-cheek variety. I specialize.' Good grief @LozzaFox , how far must the UK fall?”117744557Another user said, “Watch this case set a precedent. Next up: Burp-based harassment lawsuits. UK legal system keeps topping itself.” A third user wrote, “What the heck has happened in the UK? 1984 was meant to be fiction. Not a road map”.",
