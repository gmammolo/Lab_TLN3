  "text": "By Declan Gallagher ,\n6 hours ago\nThe unexpected feud between comedian Bill Burr and America’s Got Talent judge Howie Mandel is gaining steam, with both men publicly trading barbs.\nIt all started when Burr appeared as a guest on Mandel’s podcast, Howie Mandel Does Stuff . In the middle of Burr’s interview, Mandel surprised him by bringing out Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan . Back in November, Corgan told Mandel on the same podcast that, years ago, his mother confided in him that Burr might be his half-brother .\nBurr initially took issue with Corgan sharing the story, but it soon became clear that Mandel had urged Corgan to publicly tell the tale. Corgan was also under the impression that Burr knew he’d be dropping by, but Mandel told the two he “thought it would be a good surprise.”\nCorgan explained to Burr: “I told him privately that story and [Mandel] said, ‘Oh you’ve got to say this on the air.’” At that point, the comedian turned on Mandel. “You’re an a--hole,” Burr told him, accusing the host of bringing Corgan on for “the f---ing ratings.”\nOn Wednesday, Burr addressed the controversy during an interview on The Rich Eisen Show . “Howie did what he did because he is a Hollywood whore and he doesn’t care what happens,” Burr stated frankly, adding that he felt like Mandel enjoyed “bring[ing] up all that weirdness.” The King of Staten Island star said he has no problem with Corgan, but doesn’t enjoy sharing aspects of his personal life with the public. “Billy’s fine. That’s the first time I ever met him and it was fine or whatever,” Burr said. “But I did not appreciate what Howie did. Not at all.”\nRelated: Bill Burr Doesn't Mince Words Talking About Slain United Healthcare CEO\nWhen Eisen asked Burr if he was “pissed” at Mandel, the comedian responded: “He’s Howie, so he’s sorta hard to hate. How do you hate a germaphobe? He’s like, not threatening. He just walks with his arms in so he doesn’t rub against curtains that he owns…He’s a strange man.”\nBut Mandel wasn’t about to let Burr have the last word. On Thursday, the host took to his Instagram Stories to post a rebuttal. Set to the Smashing Pumpkins’ song “Today,” Mandel shared a photoshopped poster of the movie Step Brothers , with the faces of stars Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly swapped for Corgan and Burr, respectively.\nBurr has yet to respond to Mandel’s latest provocation.",
