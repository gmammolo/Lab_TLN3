A few days ago, on social media, you saw a video of mine in which I had proposed Rakhi Sawant. I proposed her because I know her very well. When I started knowing her, I felt she is a person who loves god a lot. She has seen a lot of ups and downs in her life, she lost her parents but was with them when they were ill. A guy came in her life, you all know what he did to her. She has come out of a lot of trauma. She accepted Islam, went for Umrah, and changed her name to Fatima. I liked that a lot that’s why I proposed to her,\" Dodi said in Hindi.\n“But, I think that this is not acceptable to people because I have received a lot of messages and videos, and I cannot tolerate it. So, Rakhi ji, you are my very good friend, and will always be. You might not be able to be my bride, but I promise you that you will become the daughter-in-law of Pakistan. I will make you get married to one of my brothers,\" he added.\nRakhi Sawant was previously married to Adil Khan Durrani. However, the two parted ways in 2023.
