She lived in Oak Ridge with her parents and siblings during the infamous Manhattan Project days and often recalled the “Boom Town”, even though no one was aware of what the project was at the time.\nReva was an amazingly kind and joyful soul. She loved to laugh, take trips to the beach, walk around the lake, and sing, and she was one of the best bakers in the world. She believed in everyone getting along. She prayed for her family and enjoyed attending church. She loved to read and completed the New York Times Sunday Crossword puzzle for many years. She enjoyed entertaining and was a welcoming hostess to all ages. She always had something sweet for her guests and lots of hot coffee.\nReva graduated from Lenoir High School in 1949. She was a little younger than her classmates because she skipped a grade in elementary school. She was a smart young lady.\nWhile Bob served in the Army, she finished at Knoxville Business College with a secretarial degree; and after he started his business at City Barber Shop, she went on to work at Dayco Corporation in the Research and Development Department for many years. Her days at Dayco and the friends she made there were always important to her.\nShe taught Sunday School, sang soprano in the choir, and served on many other committees at Hazelwood Baptist Church.\nShe was a brilliant mother and loyal friend. She and her husband, Bob, were 40+ year members of the V-8 supper club of Mr. and Mrs. Sam Wiggins, Mr. and Mrs. Bill Kanos, Mr. and Mrs. Carol Underwood, and close friends of Bud and Bernice Wilson, and Bob and Barbara Buchanan. They were all a wonderful circle of friends who sang, ate, vacationed, and worshipped together. The children of these families are still all friends today.\nServices are planned for April 12, 2025, with visitation from 1-3 followed by a Celebration of Life Ceremony at Garrett Funeral Home in Waynesville, NC.\nInstead of flowers, please consider donating to the Mountain Projects’ “Share the Warmth” program that helps so many people stay warm during the cold winter months in our community.\nKeep it Clean.
