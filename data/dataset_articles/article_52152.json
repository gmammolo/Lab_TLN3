  "text": "The Orlando-area theme parks see millions of visitors each year, and between the 100+° weather and the physical exertion it takes to navigate the parks, it’s no surprise that in-park injuries are reported from time to time.\nWelcome to Walt Disney World Each year, the Florida Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services publishes its “ MOU Exempt Facilities Report ,” which documents serious ride-related Injuries at Orlando theme parks, including Walt Disney World, Universal, Busch Gardens, LEGOLAND, and SeaWorld. Now, we have the data from last year, and the document reveals the most commonly reported injuries in 2024.\nIt is important to note that the MOU Exempt Facilities Report does not cover minor incidents; the injuries recorded in this document are only serious incidents that required hospitalization for at least 24 hours.\nMagic Kingdom In 2024, 46 serious injuries were reported between Walt Disney World, Universal, Busch Gardens, LEGOLAND, and SeaWorld. The majority of those injured were 65+ years old (about 37%), while 28% were 45-60 years old. Ten of those injured were 30-45 years old, four were 20-30 years old, and two were less than 20 years old.\nMagic Kingdom As we mentioned, the injuries recorded in this document were serious incidents that required hospitalization for at least 24 hours. Of those injuries, ten were reported as “Syncope/Loss of Consciousness.” Five people experienced “Nausea/Emesis,” and five cases were labeled as “Dizziness.” Below, you can see the full list of injuries reported in 2024:\nSyncope/Loss of Consciousness: 10 Nausea/Emesis: 5 Dizziness: 5 Injury while entering/exiting attraction: 5 Chest Pains: 5 Seizure: 5 Shortness of Breath: 4 Headache/Head Pain: 3 Motion Sickness: 2 Vomiting: 1 Cardiac Event: 1 Dislodged medical device: 1 Leg Pain: 1 Back Pain: 1 Disoriented: 1 The most commonly reported incident in 2024 was fainting. While summer is the hottest part of the year in Orlando, only three of the ten syncope incidents happened between April and June 2024. Two cases were reported between October and December, and five cases were reported between January and March of 2024.\nEPCOT Disney World and Universal appear to have the most reported incidents in 2024, though these parks likely welcome thousands more guests than the other three smaller theme parks in Orlando.\nChina Pavilion Looking for more details about the 2024 MOU Exempt Facilities Report ? We’ve got everything you need to know about these injuries, where they happened, and the attractions that had the highest number of reported injuries. Check out the full story below.\nNew Report Reveals All the Ride-Related Injuries at Theme Parks in 2024 While these injuries are significant, it’s important to remember that there are ways to protect yourself from serious injuries. Drink lots of water on vacation — especially in the summer — and know your body’s limitations. It can be surprisingly easy to overdo it on vacation, but that can lead to some painful consequences.\nFirst Aid Center at Magic Kingdom Don’t forget that Orlando theme parks have First Aid Centers you can visit for minor injuries. Even if you just fall and scrape your arm, it’s important to clean your injury and protect it as soon as possible.\nFirst Aid at Blizzard Beach In the meantime, we’re always on the lookout for the latest Disney news, so stay tuned for more.\nI Got Hurt at Universal Orlando.
