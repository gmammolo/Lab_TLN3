  "text": "The Extreme Carnivore Diet: A Florida Man’s journey from Weight Loss to Cholesterol Lesions\nEating Florida man took his dietary habits to an extreme that left doctors stunned. According to a report published in carnivore diet he‌ discovered online, consuming 6 to 9 pounds of cheese⁤ adn sticks of butter⁢ daily.\nThe ⁣man’s routine included mixing these high-fat ​ingredients into his “daily hamburgers,”⁣ a practice that initially seemed⁢ to yield positive results. As reported by cholesterol -hands-while-carnivore-diet-jama” target=” blank” rel=”noopener”>Fox 10 ⁢Phoenix, he experienced weight loss, improved mental⁢ clarity, and increased energy. Though, months​ into​ this extreme regimen,⁣ he noticed something alarming: strange yellow lesions on his hands and ‌other parts of his body.\nDoctors diagnosed the condition as⁣ xanthelasma, a buildup of cholesterol deposits that the body cannot ‌process. These lesions, described as‌ “globs of pure, unleaded cholesterol,” were a direct result of his excessive intake of​ saturated fats .\nThe case highlights the potential ‍dangers of extreme dietary practices, notably those that‍ eliminate entire food groups.While the ‍carnivore diet ​has gained popularity for its purported‌ benefits, ‍this incident serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated wiht unbalanced nutrition.",
