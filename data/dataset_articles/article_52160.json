  "text": "The student (BBC1)\nJudgement:\n(Yes, no stars!)\nFlops, each of them. Hopeless, crimps disasters that failed so badly, it was physically uncomfortable. How can someone perform so terribly and are not aware of it?\nI am not talking about the candidates on the student, although they were also embarrassing. It is the jokes of Lord Sugar who leave me with my teeth and my eyelids clamped tightly in pain.\n“I am looking for a Bezos, not Bozo,” he greeted the 18 hopeful- a lamb zoes, “not” beeszoss “).\n“Are you in the air conditioning.” He asked a participant. “You blows hot and cold, is it?”\nAll students chuckled duty, although their entertainment was drowned out by the howling of the cheerfulness of the Sidekicks of the Good Lord, Karren Brady and Tim Campbell.\nThis way you get ahead in business – smile loudly when the boss crackles funny.\nMany of his one-liners are rough and childish. While he pushed the business plans of the teams aside, he sniffed: “I have a number of CVs here – some contain more nonsense than the river Thames.”\nWhen an office junior twisted his geography, during a sales trip to the Austrian mountains, Sugar grinned: ‘I believe you had problems with your Dolomites. I think I can get some cream for that. ‘\nFlops, each of them. Hopeless, collapsing disasters that failed so badly, it was physically uncomfortable – and that was just the jokes of Lord Sugar\n“This is where the Schnitzel touches the fan,” he added, while the Austrian puns continued.\n“Do-re-mi, no dough for me.” He told a woman to “keep your von trapp closed.”\nWho writes this Drivel? And how can we let them stop?\nThe simplest solution is the obvious: the student is desperately outdated and has no place on Primetime TV. It should have been canceled years ago.\nThe format has hardly changed since the 1990s. We still see endless staged recordings of the students who are submitted in Limousines or walk along streets in flaps and high heels.\nRepetitive operations choose their self -satisfied have and the most awkward Asids, who encourage them to behave like idiots in the hope of extra screen time.\nHalf of them have no real interest in ‘becoming the next business partner of Lord Sugar’ – they are just looking for publicity on social media.\n“You have not sold anything, did you?” Baroness Brady snarled at One Apprentice, Emma. “Technically,” she admitted, as if she thought it was unfair for criticism to be based on factual facts.\nThe student is desperately outdated and has no place on Primetime TV. It should have been canceled years ago, writes Christopher Stevens\nIn reality, British companies are struggling to float, with the number of bankruptcy at 25 percent on last year, according to a recent report.\nBut this show, a return to the era before the Bank Crisis of 2008, continues to celebrate stupidity, mismanagement, backstabbing and cluelessness.\n“It’s a mess, you know, a bloody mess,” glow sugar, while sending his first victim, the unfortunate Emma.\nBut to see that British Business Hopeful Failure is no longer funny. And, Lord, nor are the jokes of the boss not.",
