  "text": "You deserve clear audio. Summary Distorted audio can result from turning speakers up too high, causing signal clipping or mechanical damage.\nProviding too much power from an amp can overdrive speakers, leading to audio distortion and potential permanent damage.\nThe speaker placement can significantly affect sound quality and cause distortion, especially when placed too close to a wall.\nNobody wants to sit down, put on a movie, and have it sound fuzzy and distorted. Here are some major reasons why your audio might be distorted, and how you can avoid and fix it.\nYou Have the Volume Turned Up Too High\nIf the volume is turned up all the way on your speakers, there's a chance that will cause some audio distortion. You would think that a speaker would only drive as much power as it can handle, but at the highest volume, a lot of speakers will still suffer. Too strong a signal can surpass what the cones inside the speaker drivers can handle, causing audio clipping and distortion.\nJustin Duino / How-To Geek\nThe cause of distortion from high volumes can also be mechanical. You can overheat the speaker by turning it up too high and overpowering it, and you really don't want to fry the inside of your speakers. You can also have the coil inside the driver lose its place and rub against the magnet, causing a scraping noise.\nTo avoid this, don't overwork your speakers with a super high volume. Adjust the placement of your speakers to see if that solves any volume issues you're having that leads to you turning them up too high. If you need louder speakers, rather than suffering through clipping and distorted audio, find speakers that can handle more wattage. More wattage generally correlates with more volume.\nYou're Providing Too Much Power to Your Speakers\nIf you have a dedicated amplifier powering your speakers, you should ideally have an amplifier that has a power rating lower than the maximum wattage of your speakers. However, if the amplifier is more powerful than the speakers can handle,…\nSam Smart",
