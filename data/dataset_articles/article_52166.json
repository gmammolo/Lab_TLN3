  "text": "Guests arriving at EPCOT on January 28 were met with unexpected disappointment when one of the park’s most popular attractions, Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure, never opened for the day. The sudden closure left many scrambling to adjust their plans, and Walt Disney World Resort issued an apology but offered little explanation for the ride’s extended downtime.\nAn Unwelcome Surprise for EPCOT Visitors Credit: Disney Since its opening in 2021, Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure has been a must-visit attraction for EPCOT guests. The trackless dark ride, inspired by the Pixar classic Ratatouille (2007), regularly commands lengthy wait times and remains one of the most in-demand experiences in the World Showcase.\nBut on Tuesday, guests eager to start their day in the France Pavilion were met with an unfortunate surprise. Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure was closed from park open to park close—with no prior warning. Cast Members stationed outside the attraction informed guests that technical issues had rendered the ride inoperable and that they could not provide an estimated reopening time.\nCrowds Surge at Other EPCOT Attractions The unexpected loss of a major ride caused a ripple effect across EPCOT, leading to surging wait times at other attractions. Soarin’ Around the World, Frozen Ever After, and other attractions saw increased demand as guests scrambled to fill the gap left by Remy’s closure.\nCredit: Screenshot via the My Disney Experience app The situation was further complicated by the ongoing closure of Test Track , which is currently undergoing a lengthy refurbishment. With fewer high-capacity attractions available, EPCOT guests were left with limited options.\nSome Disney Park guests held out hope that the ride would reopen later in the day, lingering around the entrance in case operations resumed. But as the day progressed, it became clear that Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure would remain closed for the entire operating day.\nDisney Issues a Formal Apology By mid-afternoon, EPCOT Vice President Kartika S. Rodriguez issued a statement to Walt Disney World Resort guests through the My Disney Experience app , formally apologizing for the closure.\nCredit: Screenshot via the My Disney Experience app “Pardon the Inconvenience,” the notification read.\n“On behalf of the entire team at EPCOT, I’d like to apologize that Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure is currently unavailable,” Rodriguez wrote. “Our Cast Members are working diligently to get the attraction up and running again, and we are sorry you are not able to experience this attraction at this time. I hope you will enjoy some of our other attractions during your experience in the park today.”\nWhile attraction breakdowns are common at Walt Disney World Resort , a ride being out of service for an entire day—with a formal apology from park leadership—is unusual.\nNo Explanation for the Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure Closure Credit: Screenshot via the My Disney Experience app By 7:30 p.m., wait times for other EPCOT attractions remained elevated, with many Walt Disney World Resort guests still feeling the effects of Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure’s absence. The ride remained closed from 8:30 a.m. early entry until EPCOT’s 9:00 p.m. closing time, leaving families wondering what could have caused such an extended outage.\nDespite the unexpected closure, Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure quietly reopened the following morning on January 29. Walt Disney World Resort has not provided an official explanation for the sudden and prolonged downtime.\nHave you missed out on a Walt Disney World Resort ride because of a breakdown?
