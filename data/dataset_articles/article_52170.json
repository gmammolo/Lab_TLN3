  "text": "News S'pore man fined S$200 for installing warning lights on car He claimed he is committed to providing first aid to road users, and hence, the blinkers.\nJanuary 31, 2025, 10:51 AM\nA driver in Singapore kitted out his car with warning lights and an \"Emergency Response Team\" sticker, purportedly so he can provide first aid to injured road users.\nHe has since received two separate fines of S$100 each for making illegal modifications to his vehicle.\nSpent over S$2,000 on emergency equipment\nLin Jinlong (transliteration), 55, told Shin Min Daily News that he was trained as a first aid responder and felt it was \"his responsibility\" to provide emergency aid whenever he comes across accidents on the road.\nTo this end, Lin kept a first-aid kit, automatic external defibrillator (AED), a fire extinguisher and a stretcher in his car.\nLin also bought four warning lights online for about S$100, and installed them on the front and back of his car, so that he can turn them on when responding to an accident.\nImage from Shin Min Daily News.\nImage from Shin Min Daily News.\nLin said he had spent S$2,000 to S$3,000 on emergency equipment in total for his car.\nResponded to an accident\nThis came in handy on Dec. 31, 2024, as Lin encountered an accident while driving along the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) towards Tuas.\nLin said he saw two cars collide with each other, so he turned on his warning lights and got down to help.\nOne of the drivers had his hand cut by an airbag, and Lin helped to stop the bleeding.\nThe injured driver Lin treated. Image from Shin Min Daily News.\nHowever, auxiliary police officers who arrived at the scene questioned Lin about his car's warning lights, and took down his identification details.\n\"The next day, I received a letter instructing me to get my car inspected on Jan. 4, because I had installed extra warning lights on it,\" said Lin.\nHowever, Lin did not send in his car, saying, \"I had a clear conscience\".\nFined S$200 for illegal warning lights\nAbout two weeks later, Lin was issued two fines of S$100 each for violating the Road Traffic Act.\nThe notices stated that Lin had failed to get his vehicle inspected at an authorised inspection centre as required, and that he had installed additional warning lights without a permit.\nLin told Shin Min that he only turns on the warning lights in emergencies, and not when driving normally.\nHe added that his wife has asked their Member of Parliament (MP) for assistance in hopes of getting a permit for his warning lights.\nAccording to Land Transport Authority (LTA) guidelines , decorative lights are considered illegal vehicle modifications in Singapore.\nThe category consists of wiper washer LEDs, undercarriage neon lights, neon lights inside a vehicle, and flashing decorative lights.\nThese lights may \"distract and disorient other road users\", according to the guidelines.\nTop image from Shin Min Daily News\nEvents",
