As a result, the price of seven convenience stores, including cup rice, kimchi tuna rice, Ottogi curry, beef brisket soy bean paste barley rice, sesame oil kimchi fried rice, tuna mayo rice, chicken mayo rice, and talk kimchi rice, will increase by 600 won from 4,800 won to 5,400 won. The price of Ottogi beef bone soup in the old days is 3,000 won, up 500 won from 2,500 won.\nDong-A Otsuka raised the price of drinks such as Pocari Sweat by an average of 6.3%, and Daesang has raised the price of sauce products such as clean mayonnaise and dressing and pepper by an average of 19.1% since the 16th.\nThe price of eating out has also risen one after another.\nAccording to a survey by the Korea Consumer Agency, prices of seven restaurant menus in Seoul rose an average of 40.2 percent from December 2014 a decade ago.\nIn particular, the price of jajangmyeon rose 65.0% from 4,500 won to 7,423 won during this period, the largest increase.\nCold noodles prices also jumped 50% from 8,000 won to 12,000 won, and kimchi stew and kalguksu also showed a high price increase of 44.4%. Bibimbap rose 423. percent and pork belly rose 39.5 percent, respectively.\nFranchisees are also raising prices this year.\nBurger King decided to raise the prices of some products by 100 won just before the Lunar New Year holiday. As a result, the Whopper, the representative menu, will increase from 7,100 won to 7,200 won, and the Garlic Bulgogi Whopper will increase from 7,400 won to 7,500 won.
