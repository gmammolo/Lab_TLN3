  "text": "Jeannie Mai became frustrated after discovering her personal property was stored in damaged boxes by her ex-husband Jeezy and In Touch has the exclusive bodycam footage of the incident.\nIn Touch obtained bodycam footage of Jeannie’s encounter with police on December 9, 2024.\nJeannie, 46, arrived at Jeezy’s home in Georgia to pick up her items, including her clothing, Emmy and photos that she left behind after they split. She showed up with her assistant and had a moving truck on the way.\nJeannie called the police after Jeezy, 47, instructed his team to not allow her inside the home.\nJeannie Mai Calls Police in Fight With Ex-Husband Jeezy Over Property She claimed the court order allowed her to do a walk through to check for any items, but Jeezy did not want her inside the property.\nThe rapper filed an emergency motion requesting the court order that allowed Jeannie to pick up her items be modified to restrict her from entering. However, Jeannie showed up at the home before the judge ruled on his request.\nJeezy, who was not home, did allow his team to walk Jeannie to the garage, where he had her boxes stored. Jeannie was not happy when Jeezy’s house manager finally allowed her into the garage.\nJeannie Mai Accuses Jeezy of ‘Harassment’ After He Subpoenas Bank Records The house manager had Jeezy’s lawyer on speaker phone during the exchange. In the bodycam footage, Jeannie can be heard asking the house manager, “This is my stuff right here?

I just want you to be aware of that.”\nThe police walked out of the garage while Jeannie and the lawyer continued their back and forth.\nJeannie can be heard telling Jeezy’s lawyer, “The box is damaged. The clothing is exposed. The garage is damp. That’s what I wanted to tell you.”\nJeannie could be heard telling the house manager and Jeezy’s lawyer, “Let’s like make sure … make sure about having respect for a woman’s belongings.” Jeannie said she always showed Jeezy’s property respect.\nThe police took a report of the dispute for Jeannie, but were unable to force Jeezy or his team to allow her inside the home. In court documents, Jeannie described the state she found her boxes.\n“The boxes were wet, with water having soaked through the boxes, damaging personal items. There were mouse traps set in the garage, presumably set for mice which had eaten through some of the boxes,” Jeannie’s lawyer wrote. “Many of [Jeannie’s] awards were broken and scratched.”\nJeezy’s lawyer told Jeannie that they would have to resolve the matter in court.\nAs In Touch first reported, in his emergency motion, Jeezy claimed he did not “feel safe” with his ex-wife being allowed to roam around his home.\n“[Jeezy] does not feel safe having [Jeannie] in his home.
