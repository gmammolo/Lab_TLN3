  "text": "Nearly two weeks after her unexpected breakup with Matt James, 'The Bachelor' alum Rachael Kirkconnell is opening up about what led to their separation. During a candid appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast on January 28, she revealed the real reason behind their split and the emotional rollercoaster she endured while navigating the fallout.Kirkconnell, who won James’ final rose in 2021, shared that their breakup unfolded during a trip to Tokyo. According to her, James admitted he had lingering doubts about their long-term compatibility.“At the end of the day, there were just certain qualities about me that he wasn’t sure he wanted in a wife,” she explained. “He said there were things we weren’t aligned on, and that worried him.”She recalled that he had a moment of realization, telling her, “By now, I should be ready to propose. I should feel certain about our future, but I still don’t. And I don’t know if I ever will.”Her response was direct “If you don’t know after four years, then we probably shouldn’t be together. You know me better than anyone, so by now, you should have a clear answer.”Rachael described the days leading up to their split as confusing, especially since James had recently reassured her about their relationship.“A few days before, he was telling me how lucky he was to have me, how much he appreciated our relationship,” she said. “He would point out other couples and say how grateful he was that we didn’t have the same struggles.”However, cracks started to form when they had a minor disagreement over dinner plans in Tokyo. Rachael admitted she got emotional over picking a restaurant that didn’t meet their expectations, which led James to question her reaction.But even then, she didn’t anticipate what was coming next.“It felt like everything was fine,” she said. “Then, suddenly, it wasn’t.”Even as the conversation took a serious turn, Rachael wanted clarity.“I asked him straight up, ‘Is this about me, or is it something you’re afraid of? Are you scared of commitment, or do you genuinely believe I’m not the right person for you?’”“He said he just didn’t think I was the one, and he didn’t want me to waste any more time waiting for something that might never happen,” she shared.His final words to her were bittersweet: “You’re beautiful, smart, and funny, and you’ll find someone who loves you for you. But I don’t think that person is me.”The heartbreak didn’t end there. Just hours later, while Rachael was on a plane leaving Japan, she learned that James had already gone public with the breakup.“We were getting ready to take off, and my phone started blowing up,” she said. “One of my best friends texted me, ‘Rach??’ followed by a bunch of question marks. Then she sent another message saying, ‘I saw Matt’s post. Is this real?’”With the plane taking off and no Wi-Fi access for the next 12 hours, Rachael was left to process the breakup now a public spectacle alone.“I had just been broken up with, and now the whole world knew before I could even catch my breath,” she said. “I was in complete shock.”Adding to her confusion was the fact that, just a few months prior, they had discussed engagement. “We talked about rings,” she revealed. “He even told me to start thinking about what I wanted, that we should go look at some together. That made me believe he was serious about the future.”But as their relationship continued, small tensions turned into larger doubts. “We had arguments about silly things—what to eat, where to go—but underneath that, there was a bigger issue. He was holding back something he had felt for a while,” she quoted.",
