Jones scored nine of Indiana State's (3-17, 1-8 MVC) 22 points in the third quarter as the Sycamores cut a 15-point halftime deficit down to single-digits at 51-43 with 10 minutes to play. The Beacons (7-13, 3-6 MVC) responded with a balanced attack led by Leah Earnest's game-high 25 points and six steals on their way to hold off the comeback in securing the conference win. Jones recorded her 10th double-digit scoring effort of the season and third game in a row with 10-plus points as the senior guard made her presence felt in the second half. She finished with seven rebounds, five assists and a steal, while hitting 2-of-3 from behind the arc in the loss. Keslyn Secrist recorded her second double-double of the season as the sophomore guard recorded 12 points and 11 rebounds, while adding three steals over 30:27 of action. Saige Stahl added nine points and four boards, while Savannah White filled the statistics sheet with six points, five rebounds, and a career-high six blocked shots. Earnest led Valparaiso with 25 points and completed the double-double with 10 rebounds as the Valparaiso guard went 10-of-12 from the floor. Katie Beyer (15 points, five rebounds) and Maci Rhoades (11 points) were also in double-digits for the Beacons. Valparaiso took control of the game early in the first quarter as the Beacons broke open an 8-4 game with a 12-4 run highlighted by seven consecutive points by Earnest and capped by a Nevaeh Jackson layup at the 2:50 mark in the quarter giving the guests the 20-8 lead. The Sycamores battled back late in the quarter with Jones connecting on a three-pointer, while Stahl scored the final three points putting the margin at 22-14 after the first 10 minutes. Queen Ruffin opened the scoring in the second quarter with a three-pointer on Indiana State's opening possession pulling the Sycamores back within two possessions. The Beacons responded with another scoring run as Earnest took over with four consecutive points, before Rhoades connected on a three-pointer at the 6:57 mark to put the score at 29-17. The lead remained in double-digits over the rest of the half with Valparaiso taking its largest lead at 36-21 with 1:27 to play as Jackson converted a free throw to send the teams into the halftime break. The Beacons' lead reached 17 following Earnest's steal and score at the 9:45 mark in the third quarter before Jones and Stahl shifted the momentum toward Indiana State. The Sycamore duo combined to score the first seven Indiana State points in the second half, before Secrist converted a second-chance point at the 5:08 mark to put the game at 46-30. With the score at 51-34 at the 3:34 mark following a pair of Rhoades free throws, the Sycamores went on a 9-0 run to close out the third quarter to cut the deficit down to 51-43 with 10 minutes to play. Davina Smith opened the stretch with a layup at the 2:46 mark, before Jones (layup) and Semie Brar (three-pointer) followed to cut the deficit to 10. Savannah White converted a pair of free throws with 51 seconds remaining to pull the Sycamores within eight points heading into the fourth quarter. The eight-point deficit was as close as Indiana State was able to get as Mor Shabtai put the Beacons back up 11 with a three-pointer on Valparaiso's third possession of the quarter. The Beacons' lead hit 18 on three separate occasions in the final period before Kylie Waytashek put the capper on the game with the final basket providing the 73-54 margin. News & Notes Keslyn Secrist posted her second double-double of the 2024-25 season and second of the month of January as the sophomore guard recorded 12 points and 11 rebounds. Her previous double-double (20 points, 11 rebounds) came back on Jan. 16 against Southern Illinois. Deja Jones' 14 points marked her 10th double-digit scoring game of the season and the fifth time she led the team in scoring this year. Savannah White's six blocked shots was one off her career-high set last year at Southern Illinois when she rejected seven Salukis shots on Jan. 19, 2024, in Carbondale, Ill.
