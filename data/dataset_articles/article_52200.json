The Panthers (7-14, 1-7 CUSA) led the Gamecocks (14-7, 6-2 CUSA) 63-62 with 3:53 to go following a layup from Jayden Brewer. Jax State went back in front by one with 2:38 remaining and followed that with a stop and clutch three-pointer to seal the result, finishing off a four-point victory. Jayden Brewer had 15 points to lead the FIU offense, going 6-for-11 from the field in 29 minutes. Vianney Salatchoum added 14 points and eight rebounds, blocking three shots. Jonathan Aybar and Dante Wilcox were both in double-figures with 10 points each. As a team, FIU out-rebounded a strong rebounding JSU team, 38-29, racking up 13 offensive rebounds. The Panthers shot 46.6 percent from the field, but shot just 4-for-15 from the three-point line and 9-for-14 from the free throw line. In the first half, the Gamecocks built an early seven-point lead, ahead 13-6 with 14:13 to go in the opening frame. Jax State maintained this advantage for much of the first half, increasing its margin to eight with 2:51 left. Down 36-28, the Panthers used a 6-0 run to close the half to pull within two, down 36-34 at the break. To open the second half, the Gamecocks again raced out to an eight-point lead at the 12:56 mark. A furious 8-0 run for FIU quickly tied the game at 53-all, setting the stage for a wild finish. UP NEXT FIU takes on Kennesaw State on the road on Saturday, Feb. 1 at 5 p.m. SOCIAL MEDIA Fans are encouraged to follow the Panthers on Instagram (@FIUHoops), Twitter (@FIUHoops), and Facebook (Facebook.com/FIUMensBball) for all the latest Men's Basketball news.
