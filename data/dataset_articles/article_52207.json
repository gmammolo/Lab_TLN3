  "text": "POINT PLEASANT, W.Va. (WV News) - It was a rough night for the Black Knights.\nThe Point Pleasant boys basketball team fell 52-35 to the Sissonville Indians Thursday evening.\nKey stats (Point Pleasant/Sissonville)\n- Points by quarter: 7-8-10-10/10-22-11-9\n- Three-pointers: 3/4\n- Field goals: 10/19\n- Free throws: 6/2\n- Offensive rebounds: 3/9\n- Defensive rebounds: 16/27\n- Blocks: 1/0\nStat leaders\nPoint Pleasant points:\n- Grant Barton - 12\n- Conner Buckle - 7\n- Talan Pearson - 6\nSissonville points:\n- Luke Michael - 16\n- Drew Payne - 8\n- Jaunti Evans - 8\nPoint Pleasant three-pointers:\n- Talan Pearson - 1\n- Grant Barton - 1\n- Conner Buckle - 1\nSissonville three-pointers:\n- Jaunti Evans - 2\n- Charlie Johnson - 2\nPoint Pleasant field goals:\n- Grant Barton - 2\n- Gage Devault - 2\n- Conner Buckle - 2\nSissonville field goals:\n- Luke Michael - 7\n- Drew Payne - 4\n- Max Moore - 3\nPoint Pleasant free throws:\n- Grant Barton - 5\n- Talan Pearson - 1\nSissonville free throws:\n- Luke Michael - 2\nPoint Pleasant rebounds:\n- Carrsen Lambert - 6\n- Landyn Keefer - 2\n- Grant Barton - 2\n- Conner Hatten - 2\n- Trent Handley - 2\nSissonville rebounds:\n- Noah Evans - 11\n- Luke Michael - 7\nPoint Pleasant blocks:\n- Grant Barton - 1\nGame summary\nBoth teams faced some early shooting struggles, opting to take most of their shots behind the arch.\nMidway through the first, the visiting Indians started to make their way into the paint, gaining some layups and taking control of Thursday’s game.\nDown 8-4 with a minute to go in the opening frame, the Black Knights did hit a three to cut the deficit to one, but the visitors managed to get a field goal in before the buzzer to move ahead 10-7.\nThe first four minutes proved to be disastrous for the home team, with shot after shot rattling off the rim.\nThe Indians took full advantage, running up the scoreboard on a 17-0 scoring run before the Black and Red could respond.\nThe Black Knights did manage to get a pair of three’s in the final minute of the first half, but still had a mountain of a 17-point deficit to overcome in the last 16 minutes.\nThe scoring was more even at the start of the third, but this did little to help the hosts out of their predicament.\nMidway through the quarter, the Black Knights still trailed by 17.\nThe hosts continued to struggle with getting open lanes into the paint, with the Indians pressing whoever had the ball.\nThings didn’t improve for Point Pleasant in the latter four minutes, going into the fourth down by 18.\nThe story of Thursday’s game was much the same in the final quarter.\nThe Black Knights did a good job in keeping things close with their opponents, but the damage done in the second proved too great to come back from.\nUp next\nThe Black Knights will be back on the court at 7 p.m. Tuesday, making the trip to Wayne to face the Pioneers.\nThe Indians will be back home at 7 p.m. Tuesday, hosting the Ripley Vikings.",
