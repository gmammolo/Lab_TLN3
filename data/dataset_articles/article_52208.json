  "text": "SEMO Women’s Basketball Defeated by UT Martin 78-54\nSoutheast Missouri Women's Basketball suffered a 78-54 loss to UT Martin, bringing their record to 4-16 and 2-9 in the OVC. Freshman Zoe Best led the scoring for the Redhawks with 17 points, while Ainaya Williams recorded an impressive 16 points, nine rebounds, and a season-high eight blocks. Despite their efforts, SEMO struggled with 38.9% shooting from the field and was unable to overcome a significant scoring drought that allowed UT Martin to build a comfortable lead.\n- SEMO shot 38.9% from the field and only 25% from three-point range (5-20).\n- Ainaya Williams recorded 16 points, 9 rebounds, and 8 blocks, narrowly missing a triple-double.\n- After a close first quarter, UT Martin outscored SEMO in subsequent quarters, especially capitalizing during a 14-0 run.\n- SEMO managed to get within 10 points at certain moments but failed to maintain offensive momentum.\nThe Redhawks will face Tennessee State next on Saturday, February 1, with a tip-off scheduled for 1:30 p.m. CT, seeking to bounce back from this disappointing loss.\nBottom LineSEMO's defensive lapses and offensive inconsistencies were detrimental in their loss to UT Martin. The team needs to enhance their shooting and maintain focus to build momentum for upcoming games.\nRead more at Southeast Missouri State University Athletics\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
