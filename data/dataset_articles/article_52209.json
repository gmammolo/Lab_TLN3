These features might be the reason.\nStephen Beacham/CNET If you have an iPhone with an older battery, you might be frustrated to see the Low Power Mode warning — especially if you're out of the house and you don't have a charger. You wouldn't want your phone to run out of battery before you can contact a ride-hailing service or look for directions to get home.\nLuckily, you can adjust some settings in iOS to help prevent your device from running out of juice when you need it most. You can also keep an eye on your Battery Health menu — it'll tell you your battery health percentage (80% or higher is considered good), as well as show you how many times you've cycled your battery and whether or not your battery is \"normal.\"\nWe'll explain three iOS features that put a strain on your iPhone's battery to varying degrees, and show how you can turn them off to help preserve battery life. Here's what you need to know.\nIf you want more battery saving tips and tricks, check out how to stop background apps from refreshing and how to replace your iPhone's battery (cheaper than Apple) .\nRead more: The iPhone 16 Pro's High-Res Slow-Motion Video Is the Best Apple Feature in Years\nWatch this: So Many iPhone Battery Complaints, but Why? 09:44 Turn off widgets on your iPhone lock screen All the widgets on your lock screen force your apps to automatically run in the background, constantly fetching data to update the information the widgets display, like sports scores or the weather. Because these apps are constantly running in the background due to your widgets, that means they continuously drain power.\nIf you want to help preserve some battery on iOS 18, the best thing to do is simply avoid widgets on your lock screen (and home screen). The easiest way to do this is to switch to another lock screen profile: Press your finger down on your existing lock screen and then swipe around to choose one that doesn't have any widgets.\nIf you want to just remove the widgets from your existing lock screen, press down on your lock screen, hit Customize , choose the Lock Screen option, tap on the widget box and then hit the \"—\" button on each widget to remove them.\nIf you're already low on battery, it's best to just switch to a wallpaper that doesn't have lock screen widgets.\nScreenshots by Nelson Aguilar/CNET Reduce the motion of your iPhone UI Your iPhone user interface has some fun, sleek animations. There's the fluid motion of opening and closing apps, and the burst of color that appears when you activate Siri with Apple Intelligence, just to name a couple. These visual tricks help bring the slab of metal and glass in your hand to life. Unfortunately, they can also reduce your phone's battery life.\nIf you want subtler animations across iOS, you can enable the Reduce Motion setting. To do this, go to Settings > Accessibility > Motion and toggle on Reduce Motion.\nVisual tricks like the parallax effect are fun, but they can affect your battery life.\nScreenshots by Jason Chun/CNET Switch off your iPhone's keyboard vibration\nSurprisingly, the keyboard on the iPhone has never had the ability to vibrate as you type, an addition called \"haptic feedback\" that was added to iPhones with iOS 16. Instead of just hearing click-clack sounds, haptic feedback gives each key a vibration, providing a more immersive experience as you type. According to Apple, the very same feature may also affect battery life.\nAccording to this Apple support page about the keyboard, haptic feedback \"might affect the battery life of your iPhone.\" No specifics are given as to how much battery life the keyboard feature drains, but if you want to conserve battery, it's best to keep this feature disabled.\nFortunately, it is not enabled by default. If you've enabled it yourself, go to Settings > Sounds & Haptics > Keyboard Feedback and toggle off Haptic to turn off haptic feedback for your keyboard.\nEvery single time you type, you'll feel a slight vibration for each key you hit.\nScreenshots by Nelson Aguilar/CNET For more tips on iOS, learn how to download the new iOS 18 and how to automatically delete multifactor authentication messages from texts and emails .\nMobile Guides",
