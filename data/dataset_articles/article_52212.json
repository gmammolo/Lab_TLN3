  "text": "To the disappointment of cryptozoology buffs hoping to see one of Bigfoot's abominable brethren represented in the world of professional hockey, 'Yeti' has been officially eliminated as a possible name for Utah's new NHL team. The unfortunate news was broken by the group on Wednesday when they announced a final vote featuring the three last remaining monikers: 'Utah Hockey Club,' which the team currently uses, 'Utah Mammoth,' and 'Utah Wasatch,' in recognition of a mountain range in the state. The exclusion of 'Yeti' left many fans scratching their heads as it had been widely assumed that the overwhelmingly popular name would ultimately wind up adopted by the team.\nMore on this disappointing story at the Coast to Coast AM website .",
