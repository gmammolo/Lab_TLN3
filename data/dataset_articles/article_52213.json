  "text": "Back in 2023, Malaysian celeb Hero Tai was praised for flying his pregnant fiancée , Ukrainian model Tatiana Marchyshyna on Business class while he took Economy.\nAt that time, Tatiana wrote on Instagram that Hero had spent his \"limited budget\" on a Business class ticket for her after their doctor recommended pregnant women fly Business as it’s more comfortable.\nTatiana, 24, and Hero, 38, got married later that year and welcomed their daughter Karina, now one, in January 2024.\nNow that two years have passed, it appears that the story behind that incident was not as sweet and romantic as Tatiana made it sound back then.\nIn a recent episode of Taiwanese variety show Students Coming , Tatiana lamented that Hero is actually a very stingy person.\n\"I love to drink coffee and I have to drink about three cups a day. It happens that there is a cafe right below our house and I enjoy the atmosphere there. But he doesn't like it and would say I'm wasting money,\" she whined.\nHero went on to buy Tatiana a coffee machine so she could make her own coffee at home.\n\"But I can only make small cups of coffee because the bigger cups are too expensive and he would scold me,\" she said.\nIn response, Hero argued that Tatiana spends about TW$10K (S$411) on coffee every month, and that the coffee capsules he buys for her are three times cheaper.\n\"But she insists on going to the cafe. I told her to buy an Americano as it's the cheapest, but she'd go for the most expensive option,\" he shared.\nHero explained he's thrifty because he needs to provide for their family.\n\"When I was still single, I didn't understand the need to scrimp and save when buying tissue. Now that I have a family, all these need to be calculated carefully,\" he said.\nAccording to Hero, he once went to buy tissue and wet wipes for his child and pets, and that alone cost him TW$10K (S$411).\nNot convinced by what her husband said, Tatiana went on to complain about having to fly economy when she was pregnant.\n\"We were flying to Europe and I did remind him that I've never taken Economy before. He said okay. In the end when we boarded the plane, I realised we were seated at the last row of the Economy cabin,\" she said.\nShe lamented that her legs went numb during the flight and she ended up crying on the plane.\nIt was only on the return flight that Hero paid for a Business class seat for Tatiana while he continued taking Economy.\nHero, on the other hand, explained that he was trying to let Tatiana experience what flying Eonomy was like after she told him that she'd never taken it before.\n\"Plus the flight attendant gave us the seats that were meant for four people as [Tatiana] was pregnant. She could even lie down across our seats,\" he clarified.\nTatiana's response? \"I was pregnant with your child. If you have no money, why get me pregnant?\"\nUm, then what was with all the flexing two years ago?\nTatiana enjoying her business class seat two years ago Photos: Hero Tai/Instagram, Tatiana Marchyshyna/Instagram Hero Tai\nAdvertisement Advertisement Shopping Expand to read the full story Subscribe to the 8days weekly e-newsletter to receive the latest entertainment, celebrity, food and lifestyle news!\nBy clicking Subscribe, I consent to the Terms & Conditions.
