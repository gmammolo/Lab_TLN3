She joined PEOPLE in 2024, and previously worked at Entertainment Tonight. People Editorial Guidelines Published on January 30, 2025 11:11AM EST 8 Comments Bride and bridesmaids (stock image). Photo: Mint Images/Getty\nA bride getting married in four months has been labeled a \"bridezilla\" over her dress code requests Despite having been given many \"options,\" the bridesmaids, groomsmen and some family members of the couple are unhappy with their outfit selections \"I was under the impression these were all things chosen by the bride and groom anyways so I [wasn't] prepared for this much backlash and opinions especially when we’ve been trying to work with people,\" the bride wrote in a post on Reddit A bride has been deemed a \"bridezilla\" by her wedding party due to her dress code requests.\nIn a post on Reddit's \"Wedding Planning\" forum, the bride shared her side of the story. With her wedding only four months away, the bride said she needed \"to be decisive and plan quickly and efficiently.\" Nothing has been a problem — until now.\nThe wedding party is \"throwing a fit\" over her outfit choices.\nBridesmaid dresses (stock image). DLMcK/Getty\n\"We wanted people to be kind of included and comfortable, but still fit what we’re planning,\" the bride said of her and the groom's dress code vision. \"The event is semi-formal but we don’t want everybody spending an absurd amount of money, so we’re doing bridesmaids dresses from Azazie and suits from ASOS.\"\nA non-negotiable for the bride is having each bridesmaid in a different colored dress. Her seven bridesmaids had \"options,\" with 10 colors to choose from.\n\"It was fine at first, and now my sister (maid of honor) has decided she wants the same dress as someone else,\" the bride wrote.\nThe bride won't allow her sister to wear the same dress as another bridesmaid because she believes the maid of honor should stand out.\n\"So she called me a bridezilla,\" the Redditor recalled.\nBride Disinvites Her Sister from Wedding After She Accuses the Groom of 'Mooching Off' Her Money The bridal party is also not on the same page when it comes what kind of shoes are appropriate for a semi-formal wedding, with one planning on wearing Birkenstocks.\nIt's not just the bridesmaids who are upset. Even the groomsmen are having issues with the bride and groom's dress code request.\n\"All the groomsmen are split on suits, we’ve already changed the color of the suits to appease them because they threw a fit about buying either a brown suit or an oatmeal colored suit, so now we’re doing charcoal grey,\" the bride said. \"Half don’t want to buy a suit at all and half want to buy a $1000 suit instead. They are also throwing a fit about us wanting brown shoes and belts for the men because half prefer black.\"\nUpset bride (stock image). Getty\nThe parents of the couple are just as defiant as their friends.\n\"My mother is refusing to look at dresses,\" the bride wrote.\nThe bride's only request for her mother is that she doesn't wear all black. Despite sending her at least 50 dress options, her mother \"won’t even look at any.\" Instead, she turns to the bride's sister for her opinion on what she should wear.\nTo make matters worse, people are \"mad\" at the bride and groom, who just booked their caterer, over their food selections\n\"I was under the impression these were all things chosen by the bride and groom anyways so I [wasn't] prepared for this much backlash and opinions especially when we’ve been trying to work with people,\" the bride said.\nIf her wedding party is going to accuse her of being a \"bridezilla\" anyway, the bride will start acting like one.\n\"I kind of want to stop trying to work with people and just start saying, 'This is what you’re doing and when so deal with it,' \" she concluded.\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\nRedditors in the comments section argued that the wedding party is the real bridezilla.\n\"I’ve been in lots of weddings, and the rule is that you wear what the bride/groom want you to wear! It’s not their day. You’re being very reasonable. And people complaining about the food are being very inappropriate,\" one Redditor wrote. \"It doesn’t sound like you’ve done anything wrong. Sorry that your wedding party is being a pain in the butt!\nReddit users also advised the bride to stop allowing the bridesmaids and groomsmen to have so much \"control\" over wedding decisions.\n\"You’re giving other people too much control, tell them what they need to order. Don’t take everyone’s feedback,\" someone commented, with another user adding, \"You’ve allowed too many chefs in the kitchen! You need to regain control of your wedding before you find yourself at a wedding that hardly resembles your vision. It’s not your wedding party’s day, it's yours and nothing you’ve said makes you a bridezilla!\"\nClose",
