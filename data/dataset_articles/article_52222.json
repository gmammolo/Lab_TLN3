  "text": "Texas Tech women’s basketball dropped its fourth conference road loss of the season in a 57-50 contest against the University of Kansas on Wednesday night at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kan.\nThe Lady Raiders’ attempted to come back within the final minute of the fourth quarter, but a defensive stand from Kansas created opportunities for the Jayhawks. Kansas managed a 7-2 scoring run to close out the game.\nAt the 12-second mark in the fourth quarter, Tech junior guard Adlee Blacklock missed a\nthree-pointer that would have put the game within one scoring possession for the Lady Raiders.\nKansas junior guard Elle Evans managed to grab the defensive rebound after Blacklock’s last shot attempt from behind the arc and was fouled. Evans closed the game out with a made free throw to extend the Jayhawks’ lead by three scoring possessions, according to Tech Athletics.\nWhile the Lady Raiders kept the game close throughout all four quarters of play, Tech was limited to a season-low 16 first-half points. Kansas held Tech to eight points in the first and second quarters, according to Tech Athletics.\nAs Tech grabbed its final lead in the fourth quarter, a three-point play from Kansas sophomore guard S’Mya Nichols put the Jayhawks back in front.\nDuring Tech’s slow offensive start, the Lady Raiders halted Kansas from advancing its own lead by limiting the Jayhawks’ offense to 20 points in the first half.\nPrior to the matchup, Tech head coach Krista Gerlich said the team’s goal was to minimize scoring opportunities for Nichols, who stalled at two points during the first half.\nNichols reached her season average of 20 points after an 18-point second-half performance, where she shot 4-for-4 from the floor and 10-of-11 from the foul line. Furthermore, her scoring efforts set the Jayhawks ahead during a back-and-forth fourth quarter, according to Kansas Athletics.\nTo match the Jayhawks’ offensive pace, Tech junior guard Jasmine Shavers scored 14 points, while Tech junior guard Adlee Blacklock concluded with 11.\nThe Lady Raiders drop to 14-9 (3-7, Big 12), with their next matchup requiring a trip to Boulder, Colo., to take on the University of Colorado at 3 p.m. Sunday in the CU Events Center.",
