  "text": "Walking Dead's Michael Rooker and Dead City's Kim Coates appeared in a 2020 Blumhouse horror that received generally negative reviews. Another interesting Walking Dead tie-in is that series composer Bear McCreary wrote the score for the movie. The movie isn't the best horror I've ever watched, but I don't think it deserves all the hate it receives.\nThe 2020 horror film Fantasy Island has an 8% ranking on Rotten Tomatoes and received mostly negative critical reviews. Directed by Jeff Wadlow, known for Kick-Ass, Truth or Dare, and Imaginary, the story is a horror reimaging and prequel to the 1977 same-titled TV series. Wadlow co-wrote the movie with Chris Roach and Jillian Jacobs. Produced by Columbia Pictures and Blumhouse Productions and distributed by Sony Pictures, the movie may not have done well, according to critics, but it was a box-office success.\nFantasy Island follows the stories of a select group of guests invited to a secluded luxurious island to live out their most elaborate fantasies. This is similar to the original series but the movie takes a turn when the fantasies transform into horrific living nightmares.\nThe critics gave horrible reviews to the film. While it isn't a cinematic masterpiece it is an entertaining movie that is heavy on drama, light on the horror but the interesting twists make it a decent movie. It is a fun take on the original series premise.\nRooker stars in the film as a private investigator named Damon. Michael Peña, Maggie Q, Lucy Hale, Austin Stowell, Jimmy O. Yang, Ryan Hansen, and Portia Doubleday also star in the leading roles. Coates appears in a supporting role; he portrays a character named Devil Face. Several others also appear in supporting roles, including Parisa Fitz-Henley, Mike Vogel, Even Evagora, Robbie Jones, Ian Roberts, and Charlotte McKinney.\nBlumhouse's Fantasy Island was nominated for several Gold Raspberry Awards, a satirical ceremony honoring cinematic failures. The film was nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Supporting Actress, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off, or Sequel.\nRooker is known for his role as Merle Dixon in The Walking Dead and as Yondu in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He has also starred in many other notable roles, including The Outlaws, Creature Commandos, Corrective Measures, and many more. He also stars in Kevin Costner's epic western, Horizon: An American Saga.\nCoates will begin his role as Bruegel in the second season of The Walking Dead: Dead City in Spring 2025. He is best known for his role as Tig in Sons of Anarchy and has appeared in White House Plumbers, The Get Back, Children Ruin Everything, and Double Down South. One of his newest roles was in the Netflix original American Primeval as Brigham Young of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nCheck out these stories and more on Undead Walking:\nFollow Undead Walking on Twitter (X) and Facebook and sign up for the once-daily Undead Walking newsletter to avoid missing out on everything in The Walking Dead universe",
