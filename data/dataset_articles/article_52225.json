While the recovery for those who lost their homes will be long, ﻿Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board President and CEO Adam Burke is encouraging tourists to stick to their travel plans. \"With over 540,000 Angelenos working in the tourism sector and more than 1,000 local businesses relying on our industry for their livelihoods, travellers continuing to visit our city has never been more critical,\" he said in a statement. R EAD MORE: Qantas will change its uniform for the first time in a decade marking 'next era' FireAid , a benefit concert for wildfire relief, has kicked off in LA today, with A-list stars coming together to help the city recover from the natural disasters. The concert hopes to raise funds for the tens of thousands of LA locals affected by the fires, with all proceeds going \"directly to the event's designated beneficiaries\".
