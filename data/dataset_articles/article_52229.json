Credit: Penny Stephens\nAn initial permit was granted in 2017 for a carpark for 30 cars for a six-month period, but since then the attraction has used the area for staff and overflow parking for hundreds of cars.\nIn December, the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council unanimously rejected an application by the Peninsula Hot Springs for a permit for the car park to hold 454 cars.\nElizabeth Stigter has lived near the Peninsula Hot Springs for 20 years and said in the last few years the venue had “dramatically” increased its patron numbers and turned into a festival site.\nLoading “We can hear patrons laughing and yelling throughout the night,” she told the council meeting. “Scheduled concerts and movie nights can be heard within our homes. Clapping, chanting and screams from all events can be heard within our homes until 10pm.”\nIn 2018 the Peninsula Hot Springs opened a $13 million expansion, adding several hot and cold pools and an amphitheatre, followed by glamping facilitie s in 2020 and eco-lodges in 2024 .\nIt hosts DJs on Thursdays during January, live music every Sunday and an annual hot springs “wellness gathering” called Awaken.\nAdvertisement The springs hold about 800 patrons at a time, with a self-imposed limit of 3000 each day.\nResidents of nearby Devonport Drive said the expansion had changed the nature of the hot springs and the council meeting had received 66 objections to the planning application for the car park.\nObjectors raised concerns about the site already being used as a car park without relevant permissions, the additional car parking resulting in increased patronage numbers, proximity to areas of cultural heritage, bushfire risk, and the impact on wildlife, vegetation and amenity.\nThe expanded amphitheatre pools area at the Peninsula Hot Springs.\nTeresa Madgewick told the council meeting that at first her family was happy to live near the Peninsula Hot Springs but increased operational hours and patronage had changed her views.\n“What was a quiet area both day and night is one which has been replaced by music, screaming and chatter instead of birds and silence,” she said. “We loved the idea of a retreat allowing people to relax and revive, it suited the vibe of the area and we thought it was a perfect use of space. It has now become party, party, party with both extension of hours and alcohol.”\nMichael Stephens, chairman of the owners’ corporation of the Moonah Links Residential Estate, said the council and its planning department needed to hold Peninsula Hot Springs to account.\n“The applicant has been cavalier in their compliance with permit conditions since day one, applying a ‘Don’t ask permission and beg forgiveness approach’ time and again,” he said.\nCouncillor David Gill said he was concerned that the Peninsula Hot Springs continued to obtain amendments to its original planning permit.\n“I think matters have got out of kilter with what a planning permit should be,” he said. “I think initially everyone approved of the idea of a health and wellbeing centre and a spring, but it is not that any more, it is a major event space.”\nMornington Peninsula Shire mayor Anthony Marsh said he understood the concerns of residents living near the hot springs.\nThe hilltop pool at Peninsula Hot Springs.\n“An informal agreement to use the land as an overflow car park was in place last year while the planning permit was being assessed,” he said. “Since council refused the permit application in late December, our officers have been addressing compliance concerns at the site. We recently lodged an application with VCAT seeking orders requiring the operator to stop using the land as a car park. Once that has been achieved, we will work with the operator on a remediation plan.”\nA spokeswoman for the Peninsula Hot Springs said its intent had always been to foster a sanctuary for relaxation and a deeper connection with nature.\nLoading “Our planning permit application seeks to formalise an existing overflow and staff parking area, ensuring the continued safe operations of our facilities,” she said.\n“As the council’s recent decision has initiated a review by VCAT, it is not appropriate for us to comment on the specifics at this time. We remain committed to open and constructive collaboration with council to continue to work towards thoughtful solutions that balance community needs while maintaining our focus on wellness tourism.”\nStart the day with a summary of the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.
