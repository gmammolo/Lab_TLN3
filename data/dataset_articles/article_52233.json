  "text": "The Boston Bruins lost their second straight game on Thursday night, by a 6-2 final to the Winnipeg Jets. Thursday marked the first time all season that the B’s allowed at least six goals in consecutive games, as goaltender Joonas Korpisalo stopped only 22-of-227 Jets shots (.815).\nThe Jets lifted off to an early 1-0 lead when Vladislav Namestnikov cleaned up a rebound with a backhand through Korpisalo during a power play. They momentarily thought they had a second goal minutes later, but the Bruins successfully challenged for offside to take it off the board.\nWinnipeg took a 2-0 lead anyway later in the first period, when Mark Scheifele tipped in a long-distance shot by Neal Pionk. Bruins captain Brad Marchand cut the deficit in half late in the first, with a laser of a shot from the faceoff circle through Vezina favorite Connor Hellebuyck.\n?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 31, 2025 After battling through a scoreless second period, the Bruins finally found the equalizer just 11 seconds into the third period – and during a penalty kill. The B’s generated an early shot on goal to force an offensive zone faceoff, then Elias Lindholm scored right off the draw to tie it 2-2.\nUnfortunately, the tie was very short-lived, as the Jets answered just 24 seconds later with Scheifele’s second goal of the game to go back up at 3-2. Just 42 seconds after that, Nikolaj Ehlers scored by knocking the puck off the stick of Bruins defenseman Mason Lohrei and right into the Bruins net, marking a brutal blunder by the young blue liner.\nRhode Island native Parker Ford, playing in his first career NHL game, scored his first career goal later in the third to make it 5-2. Kyle Connor smacked home an empty-netter off a neutral-zone puck battle to make it 6-2, and that would be the final score.\nThe Columbus Blue Jackets have a chance to pass the Bruins in the second Eastern Conference wild card spot when they take on the Vegas Golden Knights out west on Thursday night.\nUp Next: The Bruins will try to right the ship with another home game on Saturday, when they take on the New York Rangers at TD Garden.\nMatt Dolloff is a writer and digital content producer for 98.5 The Sports Hub.
