  "text": "By Bill Thornley ,\n16 hours ago\nSPOONER — And now the “dead of winter” is upon us.\nWe got a taste of it recently as late January slapped us in the face with numbing 29-degree-below-zero temperatures. And as January melts into February, we know that there is likely more to come. This is Wisconsin in the winter months.\nBut look around, take a little time to slow down and observe. Mother Nature in January, February and March is far from “dead.” Life goes on even as the harshness of the season makes survival a constant challenge.\nIn nature, winter is a time of survival. But it can also be a time of beauty. Look quickly — a weasel scampers across a frozen pond, his fur as white as the snow, only the black tip of his tail giving him away. He is there for an instant, then he is gone, his tiny tracks in the snow giving the only evidence that he ever was there at all.\nAt the front yard feeder, a cardinal offers a flash of brilliant red against a background of endless white as it drops in for a meal.\nLong ago, the black bear retreated to her den to sit out winter in a kind of pseudo-hibernation. Cold, mild, it doesn’t matter how the winter plays out. She doesn’t have to deal with any of it. And in the blackness of the den, she will give birth to tiny cubs which will sleep with her until spring arrives once more.\nTracks in the snow tell stories of various creatures that have passed by unseen. On a back road, tracks tell the story of a flock of wild turkeys crossing. Snow is brushed away where the birds gobbled up some gravel. Their trail leads into a stand of pines where they flew up to roost.\nAs the day passes, the temperature drops when nightfall arrives. Northern Lights dance across the sky with wave after wave of color. Whites, purples, reds, pinks, greens and blues pulsate and glow dance across the sky, filling the darkness with color before fading away.\nThe night stretches out, bitterly cold with the rising moon casting shadows on the snow. The only sound is the lonely and haunting cry of a barred owl.\nEventually, morning arrives, welcomed by tiny chickadees flitting here and there, eating seeds and dried berries. How do these tiny bundles of energy manage to not only survive the frigid nights but also seem cheerful?\nThe day progresses. Afternoon brings a filtered yellow light and deep blue shadows as the cold hangs on. The rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat of a busy downy woodpecker echoes through the stillness of the woodlands. It is a familiar sound in winter. Trees once loaded with leaves stand naked against the horizon as the final light fades of day fades.\nNight brings a full moon and the temperature plummets as the dead of winter flexes its chilling muscles. Trees pop and thick breath forms frost on the face of the red fox huddled under a blown-down cedar. She is hungry. She found no fat cottontail rabbits or deer mice to feed on. Perhaps tomorrow.\nMorning eventually arrives once more, and life continues in the dead of winter. The chickadee breaks into a happy chirping song, finding birdseed and bread crumbs at a bird feeder. Such feeders keep countless birds going through a hard winter, as well as such species as squirrels and rabbits. In nature, life itself is reason to celebrate. During winter, the celebration is hard and day to day.\nA blue jay puffs itself up against the cold. Nearby, a noisy red squirrel chatters, its tail bobbing as it chews on a small pinecone. A coal-black raven sits high atop a tall oak, giving him a commanding view of all that passes below.\nDays are heavy and dark in the dead of winter. Redpoles, juncos, sparrows, nuthatches and grosbeaks shiver against the wind. Deer move little, conserving their energy. A porcupine nibbles on tree bark high in the branches of a sugar maple. Canada geese swim in a shrinking open stretch of river water.\nMother Nature in January and February can be angry and harsh, like a biting wind roaring across a northern lake. A lonely ice fisherman takes shelter in an ice shack as the wind burns his face and numbs his fingers. The wind passes right through him no matter how warmly he dresses.\nWhen the wind dies down, the harsh land is quiet. The wilderness is bathed in silence, catching its breath. The only sound one might hear is the overhead cackle of the crow as it takes wing, a sound well-known to anybody who has ever shivered on a deer stand.\nSometimes on a winter morning, the sun breaks through, shining brightly. But it offers no warmth to man or nature. The brilliant blue sky highlights the bone-chilling cold below.\nAs winter stretches on, many deer have use up the fat reserves they entered the season with. This is the time when the “dead of winter” can live up to its name. Some will not make it to spring, even during a relatively mild winter. The old and sick and weak will pass.\nYet with the death of some, other creatures will live. The raven will find a meal and survive. So will the porcupine and the mouse who soon come across a downed deer. The coyote, fox and fisher will dine on his flesh. Nature supports itself.\nSeason after season, year after year, life goes on. Mother Nature endures. And somehow, even as we shiver in the cold and snow of January, February and March, we can take comfort in knowing that the “dead of winter” will pass.\n1",
