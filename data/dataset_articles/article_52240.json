  "text": "A girl shared how she was on a date with a guy she met online, and he managed to turn every conversation explicit.“There was this guy I matched with on OK Cupid. He gave off a cheerful and happy-go-lucky vibe… until he just started being a perverted freak lmao. He found a way to turn everything explicit. Some examples are:He would say he just ate dinner and I’d ask him what he ate and he’d reply “(name of food he ate) but I rather eat you instead”I got caught up in the rain and told him I got drenched. His reply? “I like it when you’re wet too”And mind you, we never even did anything explicit together so I don’t even know what was up with that. He was in NS though so that probably explains it.He also talked about how he would always do naughty things with his ex in public places such as handicapped toilets and the cinema.He also mentioned how he was really good at f–gering girls and the explanation he gave to support that was “I f–gered my ex on a carpark rooftop and made her — 3 times”.Needless to say, we didn’t “date” for long.”Editor’s note: He most definitely lied about his girlfriend.",
