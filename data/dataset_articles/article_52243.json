  "text": "A Glasgow restaurant which opened in spring last promising to give Glasgow foodies a \"unique Irish tapas experience\" has now sadly closed just under a year later.\n33 Ashton Lane, previously home to the Wee Curry Shop, aimed to bring the \"modern taste of Ireland\" to the west end. It quickly became known for its take on the viral food trend known as the spice bag , as well as other exciting takes on Irish cuisine.\nSadly, the team behind it have now taken to social media to confirm they will be closing their current venue, but wouldn't rule out returning in some other format in the future.\nThey wrote: \"Some things don’t work out.\n\"It’s with a heavy heart that we must let you know that our time on Ashton Lane has come to an abrupt end. Our team have worked incredibly hard to create a space for something new in Glasgow’s hospitality industry and we truly do believe that our food is unrivalled.\"\nThey then thanked their staff thanked their staff said they will continue to support them.\nFinishing by stating, \"this is goodbye for now\", they added that \"there’s no saying what the future holds\".\nHere's hoping it heralds a return at some point as it would be great to see them revived in some format.\nFans described the news as heart breaking, with one stating the food was \"amazing\" every time they'd been.\nWhile another added that it was a \"big loss\" for Ashton Lane, writing: \"Very saddened to hear this. The Hospitality and food was amazing.\"\nJoin Glasgow Live's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages\nSign up to our daily Glasgow Live newsletter here to receive news and features direct to your inbox\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
