Contrary to popular belief, gold prices in India aren’t solely driven by physical gold demand and supply. Instead, they’re significantly influenced by trading activities on major global markets, including the London OTC spot market and the COMEX gold futures market.\nFurthermore, other factors like global events, political issues, central bank decisions, and currency changes can also fuel the change in the prices of the precious metal.\nHow To Check The Purity Of Gold Here are a few tips to check the purity of the gold:\n1. Look for a hallmark: The best way is to look for the hallmark. 22-carat gold, also known as 916 gold, will have a hallmark stamp on its back of 916.\n2. Check for the BIS Standard Mark: On all the jewelry, you can look for a triangle with the letters “BIS” underneath to ensure the purity of the gold.\n3. Perform an acid test: An acid test can be performed under guidance, where you can test the gold with nitric acid to check its purity.\n4. Color test: The yellow metal stays yellow always, it remains untarnished.\nALSO READ: Good News for Maha Kumbh Passengers: IndiGo Follows DGCA Order, Increases Flights to Prayagraj",
