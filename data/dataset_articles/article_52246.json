  "text": "The Kings droppped their fourth consecutive game on the road, falling by a 3-0 final score on Thursday evening against the Tampa Bay Lightning.\nJust shy of five minutes into the game, the Lightning opened the scoring. Forward Brandon Hagel, skating in transition, pulled a move on Kings defenseman Jordan Spence in a 1-on-1 situation before skating in on a breakaway. Hagel shot five hole on Kings netminder David Rittich, scoring his 21st goal of the season to give the hosts an early 1-0 advantage.\nFor the third time in four games, the Kings had a goal taken off the board, one that would have tied the game midway through the second period. Out of the penalty box, defenseman Jacob Moverare appeared to gain the offensive zone and find a charging Quinton Byfield, with the latter scoring his 12th goal of the season, but Moverare was judged to be offsides on a Tampa Bay coaches challenge, keeping the score 1-0 Lightning.\nWith fewer than five minutes to play in the third period, Tampa Bay doubled its advantage, as Hagel buried his second goal of the game. With forward Nikita Kucherov on a breakaway, Rittich aggressively charged out and made a sprawling save on the first attempt, but Hagel followed up on the play and put home the rebound from close range, giving the hosts a two-goal lead.\nWith the Kings on a late, 6-on-4 power play, Tampa Bay forward Anthony Cirelli hit the empty net from distance, bringing the game to the 3-0 final score.\nHear from Anze Kopitar, Jordan Spence and Jim Hiller following tonight’s game.\nAnze Kopitar\nOn the team’s struggles offensively right now\nIt seems like we’re doing the right things, it’s just you’ve got to keep on going really. I mean, we do have chances but for whatever reason, the puck’s are not going in. It’s very hard mentally now, when you’re not scoring and losing tight games. It ends up being 3-0 tonight but it was tighter than the score. We’ve got to find a way, that’s the bottom line, I mean, there’s no other way to put it, really. We’re going to have to score goals, whether that’s on on the power play, 5-on-5, we’ve just got to find a way.\nOn the team’s frustration level, with the work and compete being there, without the offense\nYeah, it’s pretty frustrating. The goalies are doing a really good job of keeping us in the game and everything. We’re not giving up a whole lot, it’s just like I said, putting the puck in the net. It falls on this group and me being on the top of that list to get the offense going.\nOn where he feels the team’s confidence level is right now\nI wouldn’t say the confidence is sky high right now, but sometimes all it takes, it’s a little bounce, a little something to spark the group. We’re still obviously confident that it’s within this room.\nOn if three disallowed goals over four games feels like “when it rains, it pours”\nYeah, it sure does, but can’t look back. We’ve just got to refocus and make sure that on Saturday, we’re ready to go again and keep on grinding away.\nJordan Spence\nOn the offensive struggles of the group right now\nI don’t think our confidence is there right now. Obviously we have some chances to score some goals and we’re not capitalizing on our chances. At the end of the day, we’re just not playing well right now. We’ve got to just reset, forget about tonight and be ready for Carolina.\nOn the frustration level right now when the puck isn’t going in for the team\nIt’s been tough. We’re not doing our job to score goals. At the end of the day, we have to score goals to win games and we’re not doing that. At the end of the game, I think we’re showing our emotions on why we’re mad and I think, overall, it wasn’t our game. We just have to stop it.\nOn the momentum downswing that disallowed goals give the team\nAt the end of the day, it’s hockey, it happens, teams go through slumps, but I think good teams, they get back up and try to do the best to win games and that’s what we’ve got to try and do. We’re getting some bad bounces right now, but think if we if we play our game, if we do the right things on the ice, good things will always come. We’re just going to try and get our confidence and our mojo back.\nOn having Drew Doughty back with the group again\nHe’s a key part of our team, on and off the ice. We’re really happy to have him back and every shift that he goes out there, he gets better and better. Big to see that. It’s unfortunate that we’ve lost two games in a row but at the end of the day, it’s good to get that leader that’s vocal, on and off the ice, to get us going, get our get our groove back and try to win games.\nJim Hiller\n*Hiller confirmed before the game that defenseman Brandt Clarke would be a healthy scratch in tonight’s game. He added that he has had a conversation with Clarke about the situation, but did not elaborate on Clarke’s status beyond that.\nNotes –\n• Goaltender David Rittich turned aside 30 of the 32 shots on goal he faced in tonight’s game. This marks Rittich’s first 30-save performance since he made 31 stops on March 30, 2024 at Calgary.\n• The netminder’s new single-game high in saves comes the day after his partner, Darcy Kuemper, made 36 saves on 38 shots faced against the Florida Panthers, his highest single-game total this season.\n• The Kings were shutout this evening for the fourth time this season and the second time in two nights. In total, the Kings have just four goals on their current trip to date and have scored an NHL-low 22 goals in 13 games during the month of January.\nThe Kings have a scheduled team off day tomorrow in Raleigh, after the back-to-back. The team will return to the ice on Saturday, February 1 for a full-team morning skate in North Carolina.\nRules for Blog Commenting\n- No profanity, slurs or other offensive language.
