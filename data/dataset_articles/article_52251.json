  "text": "90 Day: The Last Resort star Jasmine Pineda is rumored to be dating a man named Matt Branis with whom she’s allegedly having a baby after her split with Gino Palazzolo. Jasmine and Gino met on a website where the Michigan resident Gino was looking for sugar babies. Jasmine started living off Gino’s money as she was fired from her teaching job in Panama, even though she also launched an OnlyFans to profit off her newfound fame. Getting together with Gino proved to be a blessing for Jasmine career-wise, but she wasn’t happy with how he treated her.\nJasmine came to the U.S. in 2023 to marry Gino. By the end of the year, Jasmine and Gino had parted ways, proving Jasmine did not marry him for love. The couple has now been pointing fingers at each other on social media, blaming each other for why their marriage fell apart without really revealing the real reason, who is Matt since it would spoil their storyline. Jasmine, who has soft-launched Matt on her Instagram, is now having to defend him and keep him safe from some pretty damaging rumors.\nHow Did Jasmine Meet Matt?\nWhere Did Jasmine & Matt's Relationship Start?\nIn May 2024, 90 Day Fiancé blogger 90dayfianceupdate shared some shocking information about Jasmine and Gino’s relationship status. What the blogger revealed suggested that Jasmine and Gino were lying to fans to be on the show since they had reportedly broken up much before they filmed 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? Tell All. As per the blogger, Jasmine met her current boyfriend Matt in Michigan in November 2023. The two went to the same Planet Fitness gym in Belleville. Jasmine and Matt allegedly had an affair, but Gino only found out about it in December 2023.\nDid Matt Convince Jasmine To Start An Open Relationship?\nWas It Matt's Idea All Along?\nJasmine and Matt pretended to be friends, which is why the innocent Gino didn’t suspect what was happening right under his nose. Gino and Jasmine filmed 90 Day Fiancé's: The Last Resort season 2 in March-April 2024. Matt was introduced as a friend that Jasmine was speaking to on call. Matt urged Jasmine to not give up on therapy as she cried about Gino and her having yet another argument. It looked like Matt was looking after Jasmine like a friend. He seemed to be wanting Jasmine not to end her marriage with Gino.\nIn the same season, Jasmine broached the topic of an open marriage while discussing intimacy issues with Gino. Jasmine was not getting physical attention from Gino and wondered if she could get it from someone else while still being married to Gino. However, it may have been Matt who convinced Jasmine to get Gino to agree to an open marriage. It meant that Jasmine could be with Matt without having to hide their relationship, and she could continue reaping the benefits of being Gino’s wife, such as demanding money from him whenever she wanted.\nMatt Is An Aspiring Actor\nIs Matt Using Jasmine To Become A Reality TV Star?\nMatt is supposed to be a mechanic by profession. Originally from Romania, it appears Matt used to own a garage in Michigan. However, 90dayfianceupdate discovered Matt’s LinkedIn profile and revealed details about Matt’s career. Matt mentioned that he was a student at Eastern Michigan University and listed “T of C contracting” as his place of work. However, the description said that Matt has been in the acting industry since 2007. He referred to himself as a “SAG eligible Actor” who was doing a 9-5 job in the Detroit entertainment industry.\n“I just want to make a living off of my acting, make a difference in this world, and drive fast cars.”\nIs Matt Using Jasmine To Be On TV?\nDid Matt Stalk Jasmine For A 90 Day Fiancé Gig?\nIn January 2024, a Reddit user Maggie_Returns posted a deleted a thread about Jasmine being allegedly abused by Matt. Blogger Shabooty shared a screenshot of the same which included an anonymous DM that alleged that Matt was “stalking” Jasmine from day one at the gym to get on the show. Matt will make his debut with 90 Day: The Last Resort season 2. Once Jasmine and Matt start officially dating, he will start his reality TV career by appearing in the next season of 90 Day: The Single Life, which the Michigan man has supposedly been filming with Jasmine.\nMatt & Jasmine Have Moved To Florida\nIs Matt Alienating Jasmine From Gino & His Family?\nJasmine and Matt could star in several seasons of 90 Day: The Single Life before they head to something like 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? like Big Ed Brown and Liz Woods, who did not have a visa storyline but still appeared in several seasons of the spin-off until their split. Interestingly, Jasmine and Matt have left their life in Michigan behind after having lived together for a year. Jasmine posts pictures of Michigan snow which are old to fool fans when she’s been spotted in Florida plenty of times by fans, even though there isn’t photographic evidence yet.\nMatt Is Reportedly Having A Baby With Jasmine\nMatt Is Making Sure Jasmine Won't Leave\nShabooty and George Mossey claim that Jasmine is pregnant, and that Gino is not the father. Jasmine is supposed to be seven months pregnant by now. Considering she is still with Matt; he has to be the father if the rumors are correct. The bloggers mentioned that Jasmine was going to announce her pregnancy during the 90 Day: The Last Resort season 2 Tell All that was filmed recently in New York. With Jasmine supposedly having his baby, Matt has made sure that she would never leave him. A baby also adds seriousness to their storyline.\nJasmine has again, not been photographed yet with a pregnant belly, so some viewers remain skeptical about the rumors. However, Jasmine’s face appears fuller in her recent pictures. She avoids showing her midsection in her pictures, videos, and even TikTok lives, where she wears baggy, loose clothes to hide her apparent baby bump. Jasmine’s next step might be to get married to Matt once she gets a divorce from Gino. However, amid the accusations of him allegedly mistreating her, it remains to be seen how long Matt can keep Jasmine by his side.\nMatt Gifted Jasmine An Expensive Car Amid Alleged Abuse Rumors\nMatt Is Trying Everything To Get Jasmine To Stay\nIt appears Matt has found a way to keep Jasmine happy amid rumors. Jasmine has been going out of her way to prove that Matt is not the man these rumors claim he is like. Since fans haven’t met Matt yet, they will have to either believe the bloggers or Jasmine. Jasmine recently posted a picture of her holding hands with Matt and calling him her support system. More importantly, Jasmine posted a picture of a pink car which she had been eyeing for a while. Matt seems to have gifted it to the 90 Day: The Last Resort star.\n90 Day: The Last Resort airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.\nSource: 90dayfianceupdate/Instagram, 90dayfianceupdate/Instagram, Shabooty/Instagram, Shabooty/Instagram, 90 Day Fiancé/YouTube\nYour comment has not been saved\n90 Day: The Last Resort\n- Release Date\n- August 14, 2023\n- Network\n- TLC\n- Franchise(s)\n-\n90 Day Fiancé",
