  "text": "Representational Image | Arranged\nKochi: In a major blow to travelers, Air India has announced suspension of its Kochi-London service as part of major changes on its London flight schedule for the Northern Summer 2025 (NS25) season.\nKochi-London service will be suspended after March 30, 2025, removing the direct connectivity between Kerala and the UK. Currently, Air India operates flights on the route three times a week.\nIn September 2024, Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) launched the direct flight to London as part of a special Onam initiative. To encourage direct flights to Europe, CIAL waived parking and landing charges.\nAir travel between India and the UK became smoother recently when the UK moved India from its red list to amber. Following this, CIAL, Air India, and the Government of Kerala worked together to establish the direct service from Kochi to Europe. Kochi is currently the only airport in Kerala with direct flights to Europe.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter",
