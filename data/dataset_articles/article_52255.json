  "text": "Bummed the no collars can't seem to turn the table. Didn't care too much about Hali, but don't want to see Joe and Jenn go next.\nFuck everyone. Other than Sierra & maybe Jenn there isn't a single likable person left. Hopefully that storm washes them all out to sea.\nAm I the only one who thought that was the best made fake idol ever? Shit looked legit Mike should have kept it and saved it for later\nGreat season so far but all the likeable people are getting voted out quickly. Hopefully Mike can pull it out, but the numbers certainly aren't in his favor. Joe gets a nice consolation prize though getting to share the jury house with Jenn and Hali\nMy initial reaction is that I don't like it. Part of the game is being able to figure out where the votes are going and every vote is accountable. That being said, props to the show for adding new wrinkles.\nShereen is a cunt. I guess I'm team Mike now even though he's annoying. He knows everyone is against him. I would have stuck to my guns and not taken the family note.\nNot taking the family note seems like short-term thinking. Might help you get there, but it will lose you jury votes for sure. Edit: I think it would have been fine to just skip the family note altogether. But after Carolyn pointed out all doing it for $20 and they're all still on even footing, it would just be shooting yourself in the foot not to go along. THEN to agree with everyone to get it, go last, then back out to buy the advantage would just be really stupid. I don't think he really \"realized that was against his morals\" or whatever, either. I think he realized that what he just did was dumb and tried to back out of it.\nthats exactly what happened, but the damage was done. If he was smart he plays it cool and never reveals that he overheard them talking about backstabbing him. then when its time to vote, play his idol and flip the game\nYeah and blowing everything up right after the auction was dumb too. After screwing up at the auction, I thought he had a chance to get back in Dan and Sierra's good graces if he just said \"listen, I know that looked bad but it wasn't because of any beef I have with you guys. It's because I know they're coming after me and you're next\". Disappointing because he seemed to be playing pretty well, but I guess he realized how much he screwed up at the auction and kind of panicked and that was how he thought he could fix it. We'll see how it plays out, but my initial impression is I really like the extra vote twist. It's powerful, but nowhere near the Tyler Perry idol from a couple seasons ago. It looks like Dan leaves it lying around like an idiot next week anyway, but I've been having fun thinking about what the best play with it would be between telling no one, telling an alliance member/whole alliance, telling everyone (which seemed like the best move with Tyler Perry idol. Who would ever vote for you, knowing you can't get voted out?).\nthe tyler perry idol could have been good if the holder wasn't allowed to tell anyone he had it. also, I don't think dan leaves it lying around. its in his bag, and the reality is there is no way for him to hide the thing. wish it was a rule in survivor where a player's bag is off limits no matter what. going into a players bag is just bush league imo\nI think it should be off limits, but the facts are that it's not and a self-proclaimed superfan like Dan should know it's not. You never see people finding idols or idol clues (except Keith's, who I'm pretty sure had never watched an episode before being cast) just lying around in someone's bag because the person who found it went and buried it under a rock or whatever. Either way, I really hope Tyler and Mama C (worst nickname ever?) don't spill the beans to everyone so there can really end up being a crazy blindside if it gets used. Kind of a disappointing season overall. Not terrible, but not great considering it really seemed like everyone really knows the game and came to play. Worst part is there's just no one to root for and really hasn't been all season. Joe just kind of took it by default by not being terrible. He wasn't nearly as good as Malcolm, despite them trying to cast him that way. Jenn was funny but not much of a player and super lame once her BFF got voted out. Dan, Rodney, and Will all come across as terrible people. It seems like they're trying to make Shirin seem like a plucky underdog, but I still think she's probably actually annoying as hell since that was everyone's first impression. Sierra is pointless. It seems like everyone's waiting for Tyler and Carolyn to make a move that is never actually going to come. Mike is the newest best-we-have-by-default, and it seems like he's out soon.\nJust caught up. Sucks Joe got voted off. He just didn't seem to politic enough early on, so when he went beast mode at the challenges he didn't have the numbers to protect him when he lost.\nIt did work. Shirin wasn't making it past another week anyway. He completely fractured that alliance. What a beautiful move by him. Best episode all season. Before tonight, I didn't really have rooting interest in anyone, but now Im Team Mike. That was one of the better moves in Survivor history, regardless of if he makes it another week. Another few thoughts : - IF the blue team would have won by doing the barrel roll/walk to the finish line, that would have been one of the coolest comebacks ever. - LOL @ comparing being adopted as being a traumatic upbringing as being verbally/physically abused.\nWell yeah it worked in that sense but i meant as in no one voting for Shirin. I've been rooting for Mike since the beginning. #TexasForever\nI may be over analyzing it - but I think Shirin going home is still the best outcome for Mike. If Dan left, Tyler probably is able to nip it in the bud for the most part. Now Dan is going to stir up shit and crack up that alliance more than Mike would if it were just him and Shirin\nThe \"Shirin will never win\" line that came up a bunch blew my mind. She gets atleast 4 votes (Hali, Jenn, Joe, Mike) if Mike isn't in the final 3. It always amazes me how clueless some people are, especially Sierra.\nIt's like all these players should know what to do but are too scared? That's why those players never win",
