  "text": "CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — The deaths of several figure skaters, coaches, and their family members in a plane crash near Washington, D.C., are sending shockwaves through the sport, reaching as far as Iowa, where local skaters and coaches said the tragedy is deeply personal for the tight-knit community.\nThe midair crash, which occurred Tuesday evening over the Potomac River, involved an American Airlines regional jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter. Authorities confirmed that all 67 people on board both aircraft are presumed to have been killed. Among the victims were at least fourteen members of the figure skating community who had been returning from a national development camp in Wichita, Kansas, held in conjunction with the U.S. Figure Skating Championships.\n\"The skating community is very small, it is a huge loss to the skating community,\" said Tanya Street, a coach at the Cedar Rapids Ice Arena and a technical specialist and judge with U.S. Figure Skating. \"Waking up this morning and hearing the news was heart-wrenching. I had done all kinds of research to find out what skaters were involved and found out and realized that I knew the coaches, and my students had known the skaters, and that there was a connection here in Cedar Rapids with those that had died.\"\nAmong the victims identified as of early Thursday evening are two teenage skaters, Jinna Han and Spencer Lane, along with their mothers, Jin Han and Christine Lane. Renowned Russian-born coaches Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, former world champions in pairs figure skating, were also on board. The University of Delaware confirmed the deaths of former coach Sasha Kirsanov and skaters Sean Kay and Angela Yang.\n\"I know that I have a student that has been to those camps up until last year and he knew a lot of the skaters that had died in the plane crash. Another student had taken from the Boston coaches that were there, Vadim, he would travel to Boston for a week or two over the summer and work with them,\" Street said.\nThe skaters on board were not just rising athletes, but competitors at an elite level, training under some of the top coaches in the country, Street said.\n\"These were not just athletes. They were athletes that were at that next level,\" Street said. \"The national training camp, which is right after nationals. These are skaters that could make it. We here in Cedar Rapids, we've had only three people make it to that national training camp. And so, at that camp they learned from elite coaches as far as how to train, nutrition and jump techniques, spin technique, everything. And so, the skaters that were there, I mean, yes, this was something they loved but they were also at that level to be able to be there at that camp. And being that it was right after nationals, all the top coaches, top judges, everybody were there.\"\nThe National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration have launched an investigation into the crash. Preliminary reports indicate that neither aircraft made a distress call before the collision. The American Airlines jet was en route from Wichita to Reagan National Airport when it collided with the military helicopter.\nAs the investigation continues, Street said the figure skating community will come together to grieve and support one another.\n\"While we are a small community and the grief is hard, but we're also a supportive community and we get through, we'll get through it together,\" she said. \"The support system that we have is strong. And so we can get through this and remember them always.\"",
