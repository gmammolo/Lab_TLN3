  "text": "Free State girls basketball opens Capital City Classic with loss to No. 5 Washburn Rural\nTopeka — The Free State girls basketball team opened up the Capital City Classic on Thursday night with a loss to Washburn Rural, 76-25, at Topeka West High School.\n“I thought we did some good things, I thought we did some of the little things we’ve been working on,” Free State coach Summer Frantz said postgame. “The score doesn’t indicate some of the good things that we did,”\nThe Junior Blues, the No. 5 ranked team in 6A according to the Kansas Basketball Coaches Association, shot an efficient 30-for-52 from the field and 10-for-25 on 3-pointers.\nWashburn Rural took the lead just 30 seconds in and never looked back. Free State sophomore Sarai Preston got the Firebirds into the scoring column after the Junior Blues’ first score, before the Firebirds let up a 19-0 run.\nJunior Addie Fulscher stopped the run with a 3-pointer and senior Chloe Clossen added two more points at the free-throw line for Free State, but Washburn Rural continued to get easy points in transition, as well as make tough shots, to take a 30-7 lead after the first quarter.\nAfter allowing a 9-2 stretch to start the second quarter, Free State began to settle in on the offensive end, getting 3-pointers from Fulscher, freshman Marlea Copeland and sophomore Mallary Hice. The two teams each scored nine points to end the quarter as the Junior Blues held a 48-18 advantage at halftime.\nFrantz said it provided momentum for her team to be able to make 3-pointers off of drives and extra passes, while also staying shot-ready.\nA big boost in the second quarter for Free State came from Fulscher, who continues to improve as a leader with each game. Fulscher was beneficial in finding the Firebirds’ rhythm offensively, getting her teammates in the right position and continuing to show encouragement on the court.\nFulscher led the Firebirds in scoring on the night with 11 points. Preston added six points of her own.\nOut of the locker room, the Junior Blues extended their lead with difficult shots and playing stifling defense. The Firebirds were able to find a groove once again and add on points by way of a Fulscher 3-pointer and a Preston and-1 opportunity, but the relentless effort on the glass by Washburn Rural led to a 72-25 score going into the fourth quarter.\nNeither team was able to score much in the final quarter, with both teams playing physical defense, forcing many jump-ball and loose-ball opportunities.\nThe Firebirds have a quick turnaround, as they will take on Shawnee Mission West on Friday. The Firebirds and Vikings already met this season on Dec. 17, with the Vikings taking a 48-33 win. Tipoff is set for 3:15 p.m. at Topeka West High School.\n“I think that we’re more experienced than the last time we played them,” Frantz said. “(The mindset) is just being confident in ourselves that we can go in there and absolutely compete with them. “",
