  "text": "West Coast Fever star Jhaniele Fowler-Nembard has suffered the tragic loss of her unborn baby.\nThe club shared the devastating news on Friday along with a statement from general manager Sue Gaudion.\n“It is with sadness and heartbreak that we inform the netball community that Jhaniele Fowler-Nembhard and her family have suffered the loss of their ‘Baby Fowler-Nembhard’,” Gaudion said.\n“Everyone at West Coast Fever is utterly devastated for Jhaniele, Ashani and Drehannah. We are wrapping our arms around them during this incredibly difficult time.\n“Our club will continue to support Jhaniele and her family through the days, weeks and months ahead as they navigate this heartbreaking situation.”\nFowler-Nembhard shared the news she was pregnant with her second child on social media in early December, which ruled the five-time league MVP out of the 2025 Super Netball season.\nLater that month, the club announced the signing of former Vixen and Malawi International Mwai Kumwenda as a replacement player who had herself sat out of the 2024 season due to the pregnancy and birth of her first child.",
