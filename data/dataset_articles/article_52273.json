  "text": "Viral News\nChinese parlour offers massage for Rs 109 only to ‘exceptional’ women who own iPhones, luxury cars\nA Shenzhen massage parlour is offering an exclusive 9-yuan massage but only for \"exceptionally outstanding\" women who meet one of 27 strict conditions. Check out the criteria list here!\nShenzhen: A massage parlour in Shenzhen, China, is offering an incredibly cheap massage service. However, to qualify, clients must be women and meet at least one of 27 strict conditions that prove they are “exceptionally outstanding”.\nThe parlour is promoting its exclusive 80-minute detox massage on a popular review app for just 9 yuan (Rs 108). Normally, such a session costs around 200 yuan (Rs 2,400). However, only certain women can avail the offer.\nCriteria to avail massage for Rs 109\nTo qualify, a woman must own a luxury car such as an Audi, Mercedes or Porsche. Using an iPhone 16 Pro Max or living in a high-end property also meets the criteria. Other eligible women include tech employees from Tencent or Huawei, doctors, bankers, social media influencers with over 500,000 followers and those who have travelled to Europe or the US, SCMP reported.\nThe shop’s promotional message states, “If you do not meet the conditions, keep working hard in 2025!” It claims the goal is to motivate women to achieve success.\nA staff member told the media that this low-priced service is strictly for Shenzhen’s “exceptionally outstanding women”. Customers must provide proof of their qualifications.\nOne anonymous customer, however, said the massage felt no different from a standard service.\nOffer sparks controversy\nThe cheap massage service offer has sparked controversy online. Some argue the parlour may be violating China’s Consumer Rights Protection Law, which guarantees fair trade. Others believe it’s simply a marketing gimmick. Many question why wealthy women would care about getting a 9-yuan massage. Some speculate the parlour targets high-spending clients to upsell expensive services later.\nSimilar identity-based promotional offers have appeared in China before. In August last year, a swimming club in Jiangsu province only allowed women under 45 with an education to join. The club claimed that they have “a high IQ and personal qualities”.\nClick for more latest Viral news. Also get top headlines and latest news from India and around the world at News9.",
