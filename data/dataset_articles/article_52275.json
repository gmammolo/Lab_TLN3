  "text": "YouTuber Kazuki Nakata looks at his indoor farm at his home in Kawasaki on Monday. The 37-year-old now has nearly 90,000 subscribers eager to learn how to stretch out store-bought vegetables and grow new ones amid soaring produce prices. | Reuters Japanese homemaker Kirina Mochizuki has always considered okonomiyaki savory pancakes the ultimate comfort food: simple, satisfying and cheap.\nThese days, though, it's a struggle to get the dish, a favorite among Hiroshima natives like herself, on the table. With the price of cabbage — a key ingredient — tripling recently, Mochizuki makes daily trips to the supermarket in search of discounted produce, or resorts to using dried seaweed.\n\"I never imagined that okonomiyaki would become a delicacy,\" the mother-of-two said, adding she had also taken to regrowing leek in a glass of water using the usually discarded root base.\nIn a time of both misinformation and too much information,\nquality journalism is more crucial than ever.\nBy subscribing, you can help us get the story right.\nSUBSCRIBE NOW With your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.
