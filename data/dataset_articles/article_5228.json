  "text": "Kebbi Boosts Security as 500 Vigilantes Complete Intensive TrainingIn a renewed push to strengthen the security architecture of Kebbi State, the first batch of five hundred vigilantes has successfully completed an intensive training programme designed to complement the efforts of conventional security agencies in safeguarding lives and property across the state. The training focused on community policing principles, intelligence gathering, discipline, and lawful engagement, ensuring that the vigilantes operate within established legal and human rights frameworks while supporting security operatives. State authorities say the initiative is part of a broader strategy to enhance grassroots security, improve early threat detection, and foster collaboration between local communities and formal security institutions. Residents have expressed optimism that the deployment of trained vigilantes will help curb criminal activities and reinforce peace and stability in both urban and rural areas of Kebbi State. #KebbiState #CommunitySecurity #Vigilantes #SecurityArchitecture #PublicSafety #GrassrootsSecurity #NigeriaSecurity #LawAndOrder #PeaceAndStability In a renewed push to strengthen the security architecture of Kebbi State, the first batch of five hundred vigilantes has successfully completed an intensive training programme designed to complement the efforts of conventional security agencies in safeguarding lives and property across the state.
