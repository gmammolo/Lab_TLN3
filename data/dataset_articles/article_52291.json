  "text": "Kanye West is back on social media after teaser clips have surfaced from his unreleased Future collab album Mixtape Pluto.\nThe provocative lyrics of the Chicago rapper have set off a frenzy of discussions online, and fans and critics have been analyzing his verses for insights into his personal life and purported shots at fellow music moguls.\nThe leaked previews, from an impromptu session at a Tokyo dive bar, show West rapping over songs like \"DON MAGIC JUAN\" and \"LIL DEMON.\"\nIn the former, he seemingly takes a dig at jailed music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. In the lyrics, West mentions showing up at the Met Gala in pieces from Diddy's former fashion line, Sean John.\nBut it is his verse on \"LIL DEMON\" that has received the most attention.\nWest cryptically refers to \"opening\" his marriage, rapping: \"My whip a what the f***/ Her friend don't wanna leave/ Temptations, David Ruffin/ Come f*** my wife with me.\"\nMany theories have surfaced on the internet about West's personal life and the explicit nature of these lines.\nUsers on social media were quick to react, with some interpreting the lyrics as an admission of having had a threesome.\nREAD MORE:\nWhy Kanye West Finds Life In Japan Easier Than In The US Revealed: 'Gives Him A Lot Of Peace'\nAccording to AllHipHop, some have even given him a new X-rated nickname, as it throws into question his past relationships and current lifestyle.\n\"Bro lost Kim K, Donda, his family, his billionaire status for some time just to be a cuck,\" one user on Twitter said.\nSome fans defended West, suggesting the lyrics could be read in different ways.\nOne user said the line was about a possible threesome with another woman and was not a jab at West's marriage dynamics.\nDespite the political nature of his lyrics, not all responses to his Tokyo visit have been negative.\nHis new partnership with rapper Jim Jones was also met with positive reception online, occurring as tensions between Dipset members Cam'ron and Jim Jones were at an all-time high.\n© 2025 MusicTimes.com All rights reserved.
