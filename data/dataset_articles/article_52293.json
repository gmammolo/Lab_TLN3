  "text": "An Alabama FedEx driver realized that she was stuck on an abandoned bridge for no way to the other side in tense images.\nRaven Edwards, 26, was arrested and accused of driving under the influence after she had driven a mail car through a deteriorating wooded path in Winston County on January 18.\nBut the driver maintained her innocence – claiming that she was not drunk at all and her GPS followed. Edwards said she only failed her Field -Ouberliness test because she was nervous.\nIn the shocking dashcam images that were recorded before her arrest, she does not seem to be concerned – until the journey along the rotting bridge starts to bump.\nEdwards is starting to note that something is wrong if she stops driving abruptly, but she only looks down on her lap before she goes through the destroyed path.\nImages shows the unsuspecting driver who shoots in her chair as She continues to drive through the creepy route. The road that lies in front of us is covered with fallen trees.\nFinally, the truck comes to a halt when the narrow road is blocked by rubble for Edwards to continue.\nSuddenly stunned and scared, Edwards scratches her head and shouts, “F ** KA Duck!”\nDash Cam -Images shows Edwards calmly with her mail car on the creepy bridge through a heavily wooded space\nEdwards claimed that she was not intoxicated or was under the influence, she just followed her GPS\nRaven Edwards, 26, was arrested on a Dui -Alder after she had driven a FedEx truck through a deserted bridge in Winston County, Alabama\nAfter a moment of silence, she leaves a grunt of defeat before she exclaims: ‘I’m afraid! I’m scared, honey. ‘\nJust after Edwards was in the absurd situation, the police arrived on the spot and arrested her with a DIY, according to Cullman daily .\nThe office of the Sheriff of Winston County told DailyMail.com Edwards was booked in the prison of the province just after 12:15 pm and has since been connected.\nEdwards has denied being under the influence, telling Cullman daily That the GPS has misled her on the path that looked straight from a horror film.\nPhotos of the FedEx truck after the incident reveal that Edwards was only a few moments from a disaster.\nIf she kept driving, she might have reached part of the bridge that had no fixed bottom – only steel bars that cannot be transferred.\nIn a Facebook plea, Christina Shields, the cousin of Edwards, told people that they had to be friendly and empathetic. She claimed that Edwards is wrongly accused of driving while they are intoxicated.\nShields pointed to her cousin who struggled with substance abuse in the past, but claimed that she was sober when she was arrested.\nPhotos of the FedEx truck after the incident reveal that Edwards was only a few moments from a disaster\nShe wrote: ‘Please keep my cousin in your prayers instead of laughing, joking or being ugly.\n‘You never know what terrible things someone has endured or currently continues in their lives. You never know how close someone is to give it all up.\n‘Addiction is a disease and it does not discriminate. It is not necessary to be a decent person. ‘\nShields said Edwards told her that she was not drunk at all and was just ‘shaken’ about the accident.\n“She had a panic attack and they didn’t listen to her. She was new in the area, had just moved and started this route, “wrote Shields.\n‘We all know how crazy GPS can be. I believe she can beat the matter. ‘\nShe also claimed that Edwards and a hair follicle test received after her arrest to prove her innocence and immediately hired a lawyer to combat the accusations.\nAn employee could confirm that Edwards had pulled her blood for a test, but the results could not reveal when it was approached by DailyMail.com.\nThe video has called strong viewer reactions that show some people support for Edwards.\nThe FedEx truck was sandwiched in woody debris after Edwards drove the road to nowhere\n‘From a home health nurse who GPS’ will take you to a number of crazy places. Praying for her, “wrote a woman.\nOthers seemed a bit skeptical to her claim on austerity, in which one user wrote: ‘She could have died. I hope this wakes her up and she gets the help she needs. ‘\nEdwards did not respond publicly to the FedEx debacle, but she commented on her cousin’s message: “If anyone has questions, you can all call or text me.”\nFedex told DailyMail.com that Edwards ‘no longer provides service’ for the company.\n“The reported behavior is not acceptable nor consistent with the professionalism that FedEx team members demonstrate every day in the safe and safe supply of millions of packages to our customers,” Fedex wrote.\nDailymail.com has contacted Edwards and Shields for comment.",
