  "text": "Even though the maid of honor is getting married a month after the bride, only other guests' spouses were invited\nBy Ashlyn Robinette Ashlyn Robinette Ashlyn Robinette is a Weddings Writer at PEOPLE. She joined PEOPLE in 2024, and previously worked at Entertainment Tonight. People Editorial Guidelines Published on January 30, 2025 07:30AM EST 58 Comments Two women arguing (stock image). Photo: Getty\nA bride is refusing to allow her maid of honor's fiancé to attend her wedding.\nIn a post on Reddit's \"Wedding Planning\" forum, the maid of honor said that when she initially accepted the role it never crossed her mind that her best friend, who is getting married this spring, would exclude her fiancé from her wedding. The bride claimed that her parents didn't want anyone to bring plus-ones for financial reasons, but the maid of honor knows \"she invited spouses of other people.\"\n\"I think he would have been invited if we were already married … but we barely missed the cutoff?\" the Redditor wrote.\nShe continued: \"I understand her parents not wanting random plus-ones, but I’m her best friend, maid of honor, and this is my fiancé, not my boyfriend of a month.\"\nThe maid of honor and bride got engaged two weeks apart. If it weren't for the bride moving up her wedding date, the maid of honor's wedding would have taken place months before hers. If it had, she's confident that her soon-to-be husband would have made the guest list.\nBride and Groom Split Wedding Guests Into A- and B-Listers — Only Invite B-Listers to Watch Recording on Zoom Wedding ceremony (stock image). Getty\n\"I’m going to be planning her bridal shower and her bachelorette weekend and I feel like the least she could do is invite my fiancé who will be my husband one month later!\" she said.\nTo add on, the maid of honor's wedding guest list is 80 people shorter, yet she made room for the bride's husband.\n\"She’s inviting like 100 people and my wedding is only 20 people but it never would have crossed my mind to not invite her fiancé (even though I’d rather him not be there because I barely know him and it's pretty much just our immediate family coming, but I would never make her travel to my wedding alone and not have her man there),\" she argued.\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\nThe woman noted that in addition to doing so much for the bride as maid of honor, she also will have to travel far for her wedding and it would be nice to have some company.\n\"I will be traveling far to get to the wedding and it would be nice to travel and be able to stay in a hotel with my fiancé, and maybe even get to stay an extra day with him and explore instead of twiddling my thumbs alone at a hotel and then coming home,\" the maid of honor said.\nMan Disinvites Sister from Nuptials Because She Refuses to Hand Over Late Mother’s Wedding Ring A bride and groom (stock image). Getty\n\"I haven’t responded to her text yet because I have no idea what to say,\" she concluded. \"I don’t want to cause a fight — we’ve never had any issues. But am I in the wrong?\"\nIn the comments section, Redditors agreed with the poster that she should be allowed to bring her fiancé, and argued that the bride wasn't being a good friend by excluding him.\n\"That's so crazy of your friend to not invite your fiancé. He is not a 'plus one,' he should be a named guest!\" one user commented. \"I'm so sorry. I would be extremely hurt if my friend made that choice. Rubbing salt in the wound that you will need to travel for it and do so much planning for the various events.\"\n\"She has 100 guests and couldn’t invite the fiancé of her best friend and maid of honor, who I assume has been putting in tons of money/labor for her wedding?\" another person wrote. \"Are you sure she is your best friend?\"\nClose",
