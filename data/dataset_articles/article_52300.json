  "text": "When LA Knight first debuted as Max Dupri on the WWE main roster, it felt like he was doomed to fail. Fans of NWA and TNA knew what he was capable of, and his run in NXT had been successful enough to suggest his character did not need to change on the main roster. But Vince being Vince, he made him the manager of Maximum Male Models . Then Vince McMahon went away and Triple H took over, leading to the return of LA Knight. He quickly got over with fans with his brash personality, fiery promo style, and in-ring ability.\nRelated 10 Backstage Tales About LA Knight Fans Should Know While LA Knight is a relatively new phenomenon to many, his career goes back about two decades, which means there are a lot of backstage stories.\nPosts That popularity even had him briefly ascending to the main event, where he challenged Roman Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Championship . He didn't succeed, but fans bought into him as a main event star. A high-profile feud with Logan Paul won him the United States Championship , but instead of elevating him to the next level, his title reign was when the wheels began to come off. Shinsuke Nakamura soundly beat him, and Knight appears to have settled into a midcard role that sees him win some and lose some. Fans may not want to hear it, but it's very likely that he has already hit his ceiling in WWE, and it's not a very high one.\nWWE's Roster Is Just Too Stacked There Are Only So Many Main Event Spots To Go Around\nWWE has several established main-event stars. LA Knight got a shot at the spotlight before settling back into the midcard. The top-heavy roster is to LA Knight's detriment. It's great for fans and a booking headache for Triple H, but WWE's roster is incredibly stacked right now. Beyond major stars like Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns , and CM Punk, or even legends like Randy Orton or John Cena, Drew McIntyre, Kevin Owens, and Seth Rollins make up a fraction of the wrestlers established in the main event.\nRelated 10 WWE Wrestlers Who Had One Shot At The Main Event (And Missed) Making it to the main event scene in WWE is something many wrestlers dream of. While the following names got a shot at it, they had a short run.\nPosts It is practically impossible at this point for another wrestler to break into the main event for a sustained run with marquee wins. LA Knight got a second in the main event spotlight before he was shunted back to the midcard. That's hardly the worst place to be, but it spells bad news for anyone holding out for Knight's actual main event run.\nLong Title Reigns In WWE Are Limiting Triple H's Booking Style Doesn't Favor Someone Like LA Knight\nTriple H loves lengthy world title reigns. LA Knight has no clear route to main event gold. Knight could benefit massively from winning the Money in the Bank briefcase. Triple H's booking has brought back logical, long-term storytelling with far-reaching consequences for the roster. He hasn't been perfect, but his work has been a massive upgrade when compared to Vince McMahon's last few years in charge. A bane and boon of Triple H's style has been his preference for lengthy world title reigns. Gunther has been World Heavyweight Champion for about six months, and Cody is at around the 300-day mark.\nBefore Gunther, Damian Priest was champion for over three months, and inaugural champion Seth Rollins held the gold for nearly a year. For fans to buy into a wrestler as a main event star in the long run, winning a world championship sure helps. Look no further than the concerns surrounding Jey Uso's main event run , which saw him fail to win a world title yet again. Wrestlers can still be elevated to that level without a title around their waist, but it sure helps. Unless WWE invests significant time into giving Knight a story that keeps him in the main event, he's going to stay in the midcard. A Money in the Bank win would suit someone like Knight perfectly, just as it suited Damian Priest, who is now a certified main-eventer.\nLA Knight Is Missing That One Thing To Take Him To The Next Level LA Knight Has No True Rival Or Long-Building Story To Turn To\nKnight has been a lone wolf on SmackDown. LA Knight has no clear allies, or an epic feud. Fans' investment in LA Knight is surface-level right now. Kevin Owens' multi-year blood feud with Roman Reigns was the catalyst for his heel turn against Cody Rhodes. When Damian Priest became World Heavyweight Champion, WWE was already planting the seeds for his eventual feud with Finn Balor . He used the title to elevate himself and once he lost the gold, there was a clear storyline waiting for him.\nRelated Lone Wolves: 10 WWE Wrestlers Who Were Surprisingly Never In A Stable Call them the Lone Wolves, because these wrestlers were surprisingly never in a stable during their WWE run.\nPosts LA Knight has been a lone wolf. He has no true allies to build a long-term story with or a career-defining rivalry. The WWE Universe's investment in LA Knight is surface-level at the moment, and the last several months have made it clear that without a deeper connection, Knight is not going to make it to the next level.\nOn a more optimistic note, Knight has been mostly injury-free throughout his career, so being over 40 is no big deal. Furthermore, WWE fans are willing to embrace him as a main-eventer, so the promotion just needs to put a portion of the machine behind him, and magic can happen. The real question remains, will it ever happen?",
