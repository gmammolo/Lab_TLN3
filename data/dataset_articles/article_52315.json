  "text": "Local News Breaking: Random Plus One At Party Decides It’s Time To Get Incredibly Pissed MITCH M. CARTER | Culture | CONTACT\nLocal underachiever Chris Crossley (20) has decided it’s time to get completely wankered at a party where he knows almost nobody.\nThe second-year student at Betoota Institute of Technology was a last minute invite to Jack’s 21st birthday party — a bloke he had never met before tonight.\n“Yeah I just said bring whoever,” Jack said, arms full of two slabs of the cheapest beer money can buy.\n“Should be a big one haha.”\nChris’ mate Toby took that literally, inviting Chris on a whim once he realised he had no plans.\n“I feel kinda bad for him to be honest,” Toby told our reporters.\n“So I thought I’d throw him some bait.”\nThose plans were turned upside down, however, when Toby disappeared with a potential suitor for 25 minutes.\nThe development then left Chris with little choice.\n“I mean it’s free drinks so,” he laughed as he cracked another can of social lubricant.\n“Haven’t had a big one in a while.”\n“Could get fuck-eyed actually.”\nChris was last seen bumping into strangers on the dance floor while singing ABBA at the top of his lungs.\nMore to come.\nWendell Hussey LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Please enter your comment!
