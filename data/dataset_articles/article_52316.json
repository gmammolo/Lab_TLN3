  "text": "A mum's heart was left in tatters after her daughter's birthday party was met with a devastating lack of attendees, leading her to question the very essence of human kindness. She had meticulously planned a celebration for her little girl, inviting their nearest and dearest, yet, in a turn of events that would sadden any parent, none of the child's friends appeared on the day.\nIn a heartfelt Reddit post, the mum shared: \"I just need to know if I'm overreacting here. My daughter's birthday party was two days ago and I'm still feeling upset.\" \"I invited a few people and they told me they were coming but the day of the party, everyone either bailed last minute or just didn't show up. The only people that came were my parents, brother, my aunt and my cousin there were no kids for her to play with.\"\nDespite the setback, her daughter found joy in the day, which should have been enough for the mother, yet she confessed: \"She was happy and had a great time regardless and that's all that should matter but I just can't seem to get over this feeling of disappointment and abandonment.\"\nRead More Related Articles One user commented on her post, saying: \"Being left hanging in any situation let alone your daughter's birthday party is always going to sting. You're not overreacting, if they all confirmed and then didn't show up with little or no notice I'm not surprised you feel the way you do. Hopefully they will apologise and makeup for it in the future, but don't beat yourself up if your expectations are low! Happy birthday to your daughter.\"\nAnother added: \"Been there, done that, once was enough. Never organised another party again. Instead I made sure to treat my kid with a better day out, going somewhere fun, or staying in and having a PJ day. Anything they wanted as long as it wasn't a party. Turns out my kid is introverted and was much happier with PJ day and movies/games.\"\nA third user chimed in: \"We want the best for our kids so it feels disappointing and really, really important that it be everything you wanted for her. Since she was happy and had a great time, it was. Great job! ! Parents, brother, aunt. and cousin came! Wow! You’re lucky to have such a supportive family. Isn’t family just the best.\"\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks. Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.\nFollow DevonLive More On Parenting",
