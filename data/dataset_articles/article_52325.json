  "text": "George W. Palleschi\nGeorge W. Palleschi\n1956-2025\nGeorge W. Palleschi, 68, passed away on Monday, Jan. 27, 2025, at his home in Malvern, Ohio. He was born on March 16, 1956, in Sora, Italy to Domenico and Celeste (DiPede) Palleschi. He emigrated with his parents and brothers to the United States four months later, settling in Malvern, Ohio, where he spent the majority of his life. He graduated from Malvern High School in 1974. He owned and operated Malvern Plumbing & Heating for over 30 years, was a social member of Malvern American Legion Post 375 and the Minerva VFW Post 4120, and golfed with the Thursday Men’s League at Lake Mohawk Golf Course.\nGeorge was dedicated to everything he did. He built Malvern Plumbing & Heating from the ground up, ensuring that his children never wanted for anything. He was kind, thoughtful, and gregarious, making friends wherever he went. His children used to joke that every vacation, no matter where they were, he ran into someone he knew. Over the course of his life, George developed many hobbies — snow skiing, snowmobiling, gardening, baking, golfing, photography, restoring historic vehicles, and traveling — and enjoyed learning new things. More often than not, he would spend his evenings and weekend mornings watching programs on PBS.\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, Domenico and Celeste Palleschi, and by two brothers, Vincent Palleschi of Malvern, Ohio and Ernesto Palleschi, of Dellroy, Ohio. He is survived by his children, Katherine Palleschi of North Canton, Ohio, Nicholas (Kathryn) Palleschi of Monument, Colorado, his granddaughter Carmen Palleschi of Monument, Colorado, the mother of his children, Marcia Palleschi of Canton, Ohio, his companion, Shelly Richards of Malvern, Ohio, his brother, Sam (Doris) Palleschi of Zanesville, Ohio, his sister-in-law Judy Palleschi of Malvern, Ohio, and many nieces, nephews, and extended family members.\nCalling hours will be Sunday from 2 to 4 p.m. in the Gotschall-Hutchison Funeral Home in Minerva. Flowers can be sent to the funeral home, and those wishing to send condolences may sign the online register at www.gotschallfuneralhome.com.\n1/31/25",
