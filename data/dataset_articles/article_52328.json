  "text": "Warning: Contains SPOILERS for The Amazing Spider-Man #68.DEATHS! The Juggernaut has gone through some major changes in Marvel Comics these past few years, evolving from a classic X-Men villain, to a tenuous ally of mutantkind, to a full-blown member of the X-Men itself - and none of this happened overnight. Cain Marko’s journey from villain to hero is one that has taken many years and a number of miniseries/story arcs, which means that Juggernaut’s ultimate redemption was well-earned. But now, it seems as though Marvel is going to undo all of that with one fell-swoop, and I’m worried the publisher is about to make a terrible decision.\nIn an unlettered preview shared by AIPT Comics of The Amazing Spider-Man #68.DEATHS by Christos Gage and Mark Buckingham, the X-Men are fighting each other for reasons that are not made clear in the preview. Except, they’re not exactly fighting each other, but rather, the entire team is ganging-up on one of their own: the Juggernaut.\nThe Juggernaut is on an apparent rampage, fighting his fellow X-Men while they are forced to work together to take him down. The scene is a chillingly familiar one, as the Juggernaut used to fight the X-Men all the time before he found redemption. And now, he’s found himself in that position once more. However, the preview doesn’t end there, as it also shows the spirit of the Juggernaut traveling to the Crimson Cosmos to visit his old master: Cyttorak.\nThe disembodied Juggernaut stands before Cyttorak, who is showing his former slave all the ways he’s changed over the years. From fighting the X-Men during the Juggernaut’s Marvel Comics debut to saving what remained of Krakoa at the end of the X-Men’s Krakoan Era, the Juggernaut is effectively given a slideshow of his entire life. The preview ends with the Juggernaut and Cyttorak standing face-to-face, leaving readers wondering what they’re discussing, and what will come of this unexpected reunion.\nMarvel Might Make the Juggernaut a Slave to Cyttorak Once Again (& That Would Be Bad)\nThe Juggernaut Has Come Too Far to Go Back to the Way Things Were\nWhile it’s impossible to know what they’re talking about in this preview (indeed, it’s unlettered), the clues are there as to what this unexpected meeting between Cyttorak and the Juggernaut is most likely about. Firstly, let’s take into account the fact that the Juggernaut is fighting the X-Men just like he used to do when he was Cyttorak’s avatar, as that alone is a pretty convincing visual indicator that the Juggernaut is going back to his villainous ways. Secondly, there’s the obvious fact that the Juggernaut is meeting with Cyttorak at all, perhaps cementing their mended alliance.\nIf I’m right and the Juggernaut is going to become an avatar of Cyttorak once again, I will be insanely bummed. The Juggernaut severed his ties with Cyttorak in the miniseries Juggernaut Vol. 3, which marked the turning point of his redemption. However, the Juggernaut had decided to be a hero years before that, as he fought alongside the X-Men during World War Hulk, and was even a member of the superhero team, the New Excalibur. In other words, the Juggernaut has come a long way from destroying the X-Mansion and tormenting Marvel’s mutant heroes.\nRelated\nMarvel Tees Up a Big Change to Juggernaut's Powers And Honestly? We Hate It.\nMarvel Comics has just changed Juggernaut's powers in X-Men canon for the worse, a change that effectively nerfs the one-time 'unstoppable' behemoth.\nSo, if he’s going to return to Cyttorak - and, by extension, a life of villainy - after a single issue, I would be very upset. I mean, come on, at least have him descend into villainy if that’s the direction his story is going. But, it seems like he’s simply going to become a villain again just like that, undoing years of storytelling outlining his redemption in one fell-swoop - and I, for one, am not here for it.\nWhy Would the Juggernaut Reunite with Cyttorak in Marvel Comics?\nSpider-Man & Doctor Doom Might Have Sealed the Juggernaut’s Fate\nIt seems like the Juggernaut might be reuniting with Cyttorak, and will effectively become his avatar and a Marvel Comics villain once again. But, why? This preview only shows the Juggernaut acting like a villain while fighting the X-Men before showing him conversing with Cyttorak in the Crimson Cosmos, but it doesn’t explain why he would even consider reuniting with his former demonic master. At least, not in any way that’s obvious, but the comic in which this series of events is taking place does offer a major clue.\nIn The 8 Deaths of Spider-Man, Doctor Doom - who has become the Sorcerer Supreme - has chosen Spider-Man to be a supernatural protector of Earth against the forces of the Scions of Cyttorak. Basically, Cyttorak has children who regularly try to breach through the Crimson Cosmos and take over the world, and Doctor Doom always stops them. But now that Doom is Sorcerer Supreme, he has made Spider-Man responsible for that task. However, Spider-Man hasn’t been up to the challenge, meaning the world could be conquered by Cyttorak and his forces. Unless, perhaps, the Juggernaut makes a deal with Cyttorak.\nRelated\nMarvel's New Juggernaut Unleashes the Full Power of an Iconic X-Men Mutant\nMarvel Comics just introduced a 'new Juggernaut' in X-Men continuity, which only highlights how god-tier powerful another classic mutant has become.\nIt’s possible that the Juggernaut pledges himself to Cyttorak once more if he promises to leave the Earth alone, which would explain why he’s talking to the demon-god in this preview, and why he’s fighting the X-Men like he did back when Juggernaut was a villain. However, regardless of the reason, it would still be really lame if Marvel Comics reset the Juggernaut’s villainous status quo after years of stories detailing his well-earned redemption.\nThe Amazing Spider-Man #68.DEATHS by Marvel Comics is available February 26, 2025.\nSource: AIPT Comics",
