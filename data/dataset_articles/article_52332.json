  "text": "Overwatch 2 is in a unique spot right now, with Marvel Rivals gaining traction as an alternative to the hero shooter formula and many players struggling to find a reason to log in. However, Blizzard isn’t slowing down, as the devs continue working hard to bring fresh content to keep things exciting. That said, a recent oversight in their attempt to add a new skin has sparked backlash, with fans demanding refunds after a paid skin was made free less than a day after its release in the store.\nOverwatch 2 Players Demand Refunds After Paid Lúcio Skin is Made Free Less Than a Day Later\nBlizzard recently introduced a new skin for Overwatch 2’s music-loving support hero, Lúcio, with the Cyber DJ skin arriving in the store for 2,800 Overwatch Coins—a steep price, considering 2,000 OW Coins already costs $20. However, backlash erupted when Blizzard announced that the skin would be available for free as part of the OW2 Spotlight event on February 12, where players could earn it simply by watching one hour of a partnered stream.\nEarn Cyber DJ Lucio in\n— Overwatch Cavalry (@OWCavalry)[#Overwatch2]🎛️\nBlizzard is unveiling new heroes, maps, and more at the upcoming Spotlight Event! Plus, watch an invited creator's stream for one hour and score this Legendary Skin.[pic.twitter.com/trw0UTA6i0][January 29, 2025]\nUnsurprisingly, this did not sit well with fans - not because a paid skin was eventually made free (which happens in Overwatch 2 and many other games), but because of how quickly it happened. The skin went from a premium purchase to a free reward in less than a day, leaving early buyers feeling cheated.\nTypically, skins remain exclusive to the store for a while before becoming free, allowing early buyers to enjoy their rarity. This sudden switch, however, has players feeling scammed. Over on X (formerly Twitter), reactions have been just as harsh, with players calling Blizzard’s move \"evil\" and \"scummy,\" and expressing shock that a paid skin became free in under 24 hours.\nMany have demanded refunds, but Blizzard has yet to address the situation. While their actions weren’t illegal, the overwhelmingly negative response suggests that they should consider refunds to regain player trust. If Overwatch 2 wants to keep its fanbase engaged, making amends for this misstep could go a long way.",
