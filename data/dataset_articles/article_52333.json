  "text": "By Namita S Kalla | January 31, 2025\nImage: Canva\nWhen deprived of food, your body slows down essential functions, affecting immunity, digestion, and reproductive health\nImage: Canva\nExtreme calorie restriction forces your body into starvation mode, making it harder to burn calories and sustain weight loss\nImage: Canva\nInstead of just burning fat, your body breaks down muscle for energy, weakening your metabolism and strength\nImage: Canva\nStarving impacts your energy. Without proper fuel, you’ll feel constantly tired, sluggish, and unable to focus on daily activities\nImage: Canva\nStarvation triggers hunger hormones, increasing the urge to binge on high-calorie, unhealthy foods\nImage: Canva\nSkipping meals can lead to bloating, constipation, and irregular bowel movements, disrupting gut health\nImage: Canva\nHunger affects mental well-being and causes mood swings. It leads to irritability, anxiety, and difficulty in concentrating\nImage: Canva\nStaying hungry impacts your immunity. Lack of essential nutrients makes you more prone to infections and slows recovery from illnesses\nImage: Canva\nStarving deprives your body of vital vitamins and minerals, leading to anaemia, brittle bones, and poor skin health\nImage: Canva\nExtreme diets are unsustainable, often leading to rapid weight regain once normal eating resumes. Focus on balanced meals",
