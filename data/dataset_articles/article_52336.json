  "text": "Blue Jay girls can't catch Mandan, looking to the next one\nThe Jamestown High School basketball teams hosted Mandan on Jan. 30.\nJAMESTOWN — Traditionally, Jamestown has no problem finding success on the basketball court.\nJust look at the records.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBetween the Jamestown High School girls and boys programs, the Blue Jays have been to 16 State Championship games and have won nine of them.\nThat makes this year kind of — nontraditional.\nIn total, the Blue Jays have won four conference games. The Blue Jays girls most recent loss came on Thursday night against Mandan. Andy Skunberg and the Blue Jay girls dropped 71-30. The Blue Jay girls are now sitting at 3-8 in the West Region.\nThe Jays will host a doubleheader against St. Mary's on Tuesday. Tipoff for the girls is scheduled for 5:45 p.m. The boys game is set to follow at 7:45 p.m.\nIn a year like this, it may be easy for players, coaches and the community to lose heart.\nHow do you do that?\nFor one thing, focus on the positives, like the fact that there hasn't been very many injuries for either team.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOther than Mari Anderson, every member on the girls team, is healthy and injury free. Because of this, every one of them got to play on Thursday night.\nJamestown had eight scorers record points in the opening half. Senior Leah Trumbauer was the top scorer with four points.\nMandan came out hot and went on a 10-0 run before Trumbauer was sent to the line. The senior drained both shots and cut Mandan's lead to eight. Mandan controlled possession for the next several minutes to go up 14-3 with 10:49 left to play in the opening half.\nTrumbauer scored the Jays' first field goal with 10:30 gone in the first half. With the layup from the senior. the score stood at 18-6. Another positive came in the form of Haley Attleson. In the final minute, Attleson stole the ball and laid it in for two to make it 29-18 Braves entering the break.\nMandan was led by senior McKenna Johnson with 10 points. Johnson wound up leading all scorers with 14 points. Jamestown's Milan Martin and Adisyn Yunck led the Jays, both scoring seven points.\nThe Blue Jays almost had as many rebounds as they did points on Thursday, recording 28 total boards — another positive. Sophomore Hannah Attleson was credited with 12 of the team's rebounds.\nIt may be a bit of a tough year but the Blue Jays are improving, developing and on their way to winning some games on the hardwood.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSo chin up Blue Jays, good things are coming your way.\nMandan 71, Jamestown 30\nMAN 29 42 — 71\nJHS 18 12 — 30\nMAN — McKenna Johnson 14, Sarah Helderop 12, Ziah GreyBull 10, Mimi McAllister 8, Sierra Gustavsson 6, AnnaClaire Bugbee 6, Alli Reiner 5, Kaelynn Talley 3, Sapphire LaBlanc 3, Madyson Schwind 2, Anna Lyles 2.
