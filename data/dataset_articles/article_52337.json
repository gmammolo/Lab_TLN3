Jo ki nahi honi chahiye. At one side main yeh bhi dekh raha hoon ki meri wajah se kisi ki achi sukoon ki life chal rahi hai, she is having fun in her life. Dubai mei woh reh rahi hai, Pakistan woh aa rahi hai, India jaa rahi hai, Saudi ja rahi hai, enjoy kar rahi hai. Aur phir achanak se ek banda aa kar unko propose karta hai.\"\nWhen asked about Rakhi's reaction on his video, Dodi responds, \"Dekhiye main Rakhi ke sath hamesha rahu ga, iss mei koi dorahe nahi hai, iss mei koi doubt nahi hai.

He praised Rakhi for her strength and resilience, recounting the hardships she has faced in her life. Dodi also noted her conversion to Islam, her pilgrimage to Umrah, and her name change to Fatima, all of which made him admire her even more.\n“Hello India and Pakistan, this is Dodi Khan. A few days ago, on social media, you saw a video of mine in which I had proposed to Rakhi Sawant. I proposed her because I know her very well. When I started knowing her, I felt she is a person who loves god a lot. She has seen a lot of ups and downs in her life, she lost her parents but was with them when they were ill. A guy came in her life, you all know what he did to her. She has come out of a lot of trauma. She accepted Islam, went for Umrah, and changed her name to Fatima. I liked that a lot that’s why I proposed to her,\" Dodi explained in Hindi.\nHe further stated, “But, I think that this is not acceptable to people because I have received a lot of messages and videos, and I cannot tolerate it. So, Rakhi ji, you are my very good friend, and will always be. You might not be able to be my bride, but I promise you that you will become the daughter-in-law of Pakistan. I will make you get married to one of my brothers.\"\nRakhi Sawant's personal life has been quite tumultuous. She was previously married to Adil Khan Durrani, but the couple separated in 2023. Before Adil, Rakhi was married to Ritesh Raj Singh. The two participated in Bigg Boss 15, but their relationship ended shortly after the show wrapped up in February 2022.\nGet\nLatest NewsLive on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines fromTV,Entertainment Newsand around the world.Trending:\nVishakha Pandit author\nA teacher who has now stepped into the role of a journalist to pursue her passion.
