  "text": "Australian Open finalist Arnaud Clement has assessed that Alexander Zverev will not win a Grand Slam title if there is “no evolution in his game.”\nThe former world No 10 feels Zverev has “no chance” of beating both Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz at a major if the pair are “in full possession of their means.”\nZverev fell to a convincing 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-3 defeat to Jannik Sinner in the 2025 Australian Open final, a loss that leaves him with an 0-3 record in Grand Slam finals.\nThe world No 2 lost his other two major championship matches in five sets: to Carlos Alcaraz at the 2024 French Open and Dominic Thiem at the 2020 US Open.\nDuring the first week of the Australian Open, Clement predicted that Zverev would not win the tournament — or any other Grand Slam in his career.\n“Zverev will not win the Australian Open, nor a Grand Slam tournament, but I could be wrong,” the Frenchman told Eurosport.\n“still hasn’t resolved his problems that we’ve known about for eight years now”\nATP Tennis News The 6 men to reach world No 2 but not win a Grand Slam: ft. Alexander Zverev & Casper Ruud\nAlexander Zverev’s Australian Open heckler received an instant punishment\nClement, who was beaten by Andre Agassi in the 2001 Australian Open final, doubled down on his thoughts on Zverev’s Grand Slam chances after the Australian Open.\n“I am always very tough [on Zverev], and it is not a particular desire on my part to be so,” he said to Eurosport.\n“But when, for example, he makes comments about the work put in, in fact the work put in is visible, that is to say that we do not need to say it, it is visible on the court.\n“If we arrive the day before Roland Garros and we say to ourselves that it is perhaps the moment for Zverev, we must especially see what will happen before.\n“And if there is no evolution in his game between now and Roland Garros, it will be the same thing and he will not be able to win. ‘Not win’ is a bit harsh because it depends on the circumstances: if Sinner is suspended and Alcaraz injured, maybe he will have a chance.\n“But if there are these two guys who are still in the draw and in full possession of their means, for me, he has no chance of beating them both. His wait-and-see attitude can never be compensated for by his quality of service.”\nREAD NEXT: Jimmy Connors makes feelings clear on Novak Djokovic and reveals why he is ‘rooting’ for the Serb",
