  "text": "Homicides at lowest level in nearly 50 years, ONS says\nHomicides have fallen to their lowest level for nearly 50 years across England and Wales, official statistics show.\nThere were 499 victims of murder and manslaughter in the year to September, according to crime statistics published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nIt is the lowest number since 1977 and a 7% fall on the previous year, largely due to a drop in the number of people killed by knives - 174, down 23%.\nCrimes with weapons also continued a downward trend. Knife crime offences were down by 9% to 50,430 and firearms offences fell by 9% to just under 5,000, their lowest since 2003.\nThe statistics are split into police recorded crime and a crime survey of people's experiences of crime.\nThe broader trends in violent crime in the survey were more flat. The ONS estimates there were around 1.1m incidents of violent crime, ranging from threats and jostling to assault and murder, which was little changed on the previous year.\nThe number of robbery offences remained broadly similar at 82,678 but shoplifting increased by 5%, from 492,660 offences the previous year to 519,381.\nONS spokesperson Billy Gazard said: \"The majority of police forces have seen knife crime fall in the past year, including the larger urban Greater Manchester, Metropolitan and West Midlands areas.\n\"This is supported by NHS data, which continue to show a decrease in hospital admissions for assault by a sharp object.\"\nThe data comes after figures published by the Metropolitan Police earlier this month showed homicides in the capital had dropped to the lowest level in more than a decade.\nThe force said 97 homicides were recorded in 2025, the lowest figure since 2014, at a rate of 1.1 per 100,000 people, lower than New York (2.8), Berlin (3.2) and Milan (1.6).\nMet Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said that while \"every murder is a tragedy\", fewer families had been \"shattered\" by violence.\nThe figures for England and Wales reflect a similar trend in Scotland.\nStatistics released by the Scottish government in October showed there were 45 victims of homicide in 2024-25, 12 fewer than the previous year and the lowest level for almost 50 years.",
  "summary": "ONS spokesperson Billy Gazard said: \"The majority of police forces have seen knife crime fall in the past year, including the larger urban Greater Manchester, Metropolitan and West Midlands areas. \"This is supported by NHS data, which continue to show a decrease in hospital admissions for assault by a sharp object.\" The data comes after figures published by the Metropolitan Police earlier this month showed homicides in the capital had dropped to the lowest level in more than a decade.",
