  "text": "Ambitious romance sim\nDate Everything is putting its Valentine’s Day plans on ice. The title has been delayed from its original release date of 14th February until sometime in June, publisher Team17 has announced.\n“At this point I can confidently say that we have reached that point where the game is complete to a standard that we feel reached our goals with no compromise in our bonkers artistic vision,” lead designer Ray Chase said in a statement.\n“However, I was too confident that we could properly test all the wild amount of content and pathing that exists in this massive game, and unfortunately we ran out of time on our current (and yet so appropriate) release date of 14th February, 2025.”\nChase admits that it’s making progress with its testing, but it needs more time. “We have our final release date set for June 2025,” he continued. “And while it isn’t quite as sexy a date as Valentine’s Day, we hope we can bring new sexiness to June evermore. And yes, you actually can date the glitches.”\nUltimately, we respect the developer’s ambition, and we’d rather it took the time to polish the title than make a bad first impression. February is already stacked with new releases as it is, so maybe June will make for a better release window.\nsource\n[gematsu.com]",
