  "text": "WHILE we Malaysians love food, we also like to gripe about food. And lately, it has been about rising food prices, especially at the food festival where food operators have been coming up with excuses like high site rental among many others.\nNetizen Roman Akramovich said that Federal Territories Minister Dr Zaliha Mustapha has removed the middle man, with Kuala Lumpur City Hall taking over the operation at RM500 for rental.\nNo other elaboration has been made regarding this, but netizens in general were sceptical that lower rents will solve the problem.\nDulu peniaga kata harga makanan mahal sebab bayar sewa tapak mahal. Ok, kita terima alasan tu.\nTahun ini YB\n[@DrZalihaMustafa]sudah tendang keluar orang tengah, sewa terus dengan DBKL RM500 sahaja.Tapi kalau harga makanan tetap mahal, kita mahu\n[@KPDN_HQ]ambil tindakan.[https://t.co/Pp8F3uBEiT]— Roman Akramovich (@SyedAkramin)\n[January 29, 2025]\n“Even from last time, people who don’t pay for rents will sell like they paid for rents,” said netizen WTF.\nفاريس added that before, the sellers gave the excuse of raw material being expensive.\nYet after the government controls the price of raw materials to make it cheap, they still sell it at an exorbitant price.\nAnother netizen claimed that the rise of food prices will ultimately be blamed on the government.\n“Oh, don’t worry. Our businessmen are sneaky like the Zionis and they will find a thousand and one excuses to up the price even though there is no logic,” said Lazuli.\n“But we use premium materials, homemade and viral too,” said BurizaDoKyanonz, likely in an attempt at sarcasm.\nThen there was a satirical comment from J A S Z. A Z R A N, who said it was all the fault of Anwar and the DAP.\nAlso, SAEDAH suggested that such stalls should be blacklisted and not to issue them a license next year.\nThe topic took a turn into the beloved Roti John, with netizen ben stating that the price of Roti John with egg will reach RM10 this year.\nM.izwan added that Roti John is normally sold at RM6 to RM8, but it will become RM12 to RM15 upon entering the bazaar.\nPerhaps then, the best course of action is to avoid such places? Finally, a prudent netizen pointed out a tip on buying during the Ramadhan month.\n“Don’t buy from these businesses that have gone viral,” she said, but instead make purchases from those people who the customer is already familiar with. —Jan 3, 2025\nMain image: Hungry Fish Eye",
