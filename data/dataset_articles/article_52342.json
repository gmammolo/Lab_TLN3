The main aim is to balance tourism and pay attention on the needs of its residents.\nHas Spain Introduced A Tourist Ban? Here Is What It Means For Travellers. (Image: Canva)\nMany countries in Europe are struggling with overtourism - so much so that they are now asking tourists to leave. One of these countries is Spain. Known for its stunning Mediterranean coastline and rich history, it attracted a record 94 million tourists in 2024, making it one of the most visited nations in the world. While it seems like a good news to most people, this surge in tourists has led to concerns about overtourism, overcrowding, and a growing housing affordability crisis in major cities.\nTo curb this, Spain's government is coming up with new regulations. The main aim is to balance tourism and pay attention on the needs of its residents.\nWhat Are The Things That Travellers Need To Take Care Of?\nWhile Spain is not imposing a complete tourist ban - some of the cities have started regulating short-term holiday rentals. Starting in January 2025, a new law will freeze the registration of new short-term rentals for three years in 43 districts where these rentals make up more than 8% of residential properties.\nTourists will be able to book hotels, resorts, and short-term rental properties across the country, but the focus is more towards promoting more sustainable and balanced tourism now - which prioritizes both residents and visitors.\nTravellers will now have to provide more personal details when booking accommodations or renting vehicles. This comes in with the introduction of a new law mandating the collection of passport information, home addresses, and payment details for national security purposes.\nFor car rentals, new paperwork will be required. This will also be needed when booking a hotel. Hotel owners and car rental companies will collect and send personal information, including passport details, to the Spanish government.\nGet\nLatest NewsLive on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from Travel News, Traveland around the world.\nAkanksha Arora author\nSenior Copy Editor at Times Network, Akanksha covers Lifestyle, Culture and everything that falls under its big umbrella.
