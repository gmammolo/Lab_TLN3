  "text": "‘Young guys in Audis. Anti-social drivers. Mums on phones. Lack of police and lights.’ Drivers’ views on the M65, road safety and car culture.\nMotorway safety, lighting, flooding, police patrols and standards of driving are being debated.\nA number of east Lancashire councils including Pendle have called for a review of arrangements on the M65.\nMotorway safety, lighting, flooding, police patrols and standards of driving are being debated.\nConcerns about concrete barriers possibly causing flooding, the removal of lights at some sections, the merging of traffic lanes, driving, speeding and police coverage have been raised.\nLancashire’s Police & Crime Commissioner, Clive Grunshaw, has defended officers’ policing of the M65 amid a number of fatal incidents and criticism of police force budget cuts.\nDrivers in Nelson have given their views.\nErgin Gulgec, from Burnley, said: “From my experience, the problem in this area seems to be that certain types of drivers have no respect for the road lanes, for the Highway Code, for driving manners or etiquette.\n“I cannot understand it. What makes a certain type of person behave like that? Why do they think they have a right to drive that way? I don’t see this so much in other areas. Yes, you see ‘white van men’ everywhere. But not this local scene with younger guys in Audis?\n“When I was younger, I lived in Oxfordshire. Then, there were community police officers. Drivers who might have committed small errors would be ‘told-off’ by the police. Local police were much more abundant. But those days are gone.”\nHis son, Tom, said: “I have a driving licence but I don’t drive regularly. I live in a bigger city so tend to travel mainly by train. In my experience, being in a car can be quite a hostile experience. It can be worrying when a car races past you in a built-up area. You think ‘bloody hell’. And you see accidents and incidents which make you wonder what could have caused them?\n“I think there’s a culture around cars and behaving certain ways among some young drivers. Maybe there is a need for some kind of community education, to raise awareness among young people? Perhaps like rehabilitation schemes for people in knife crime or other problems?”\nJohn Banks, of Nelson, said: “There is a lot of anti-social behaviour with cars going around the streets, especially at night. Nelson is a different town after 11pm. You can see where cars have hit barriers and buildings. There’s been at least two fatalities in Nelson town centre. Places around Manchester Road, Carr Road and St Mary’s Church are bad. A couple were knocked over by a quad bike. There’s been a cluster of incidents around the junctions.\n“The standard of driving and car safety here is abysmal. You see lots of near-misses as you drive around. Outside schools, mums are dropping-off their kids in cars while being on the phone. And kids aren’t wearing seat belts.\n“The M65 has bad lighting and floods happen near the concrete barriers. There’s nowhere for the water to go. Drivers are aquaplaning. They lose control. They can’t see the water on the motorway because it’s so dark.\n“I think we need more police in town centres and on the M65. Motorways are also fast routes and and out of places. Criminals can get in and out of towns or villages quickly, and transport things like drugs.”\nTaxi driver Nasir Mahmood said: “Some drivers go far-too fast. I might be going at 70mph on the motorway and they flash passed me. There seems to be young people who are taking risks and perhaps showing off? Taxi drivers have to be patient.\n“I used to drive in Germany, where the motorways tend to be very straight and have the same number of lanes. They are simpler. In the UK, some motorways can be curved and the number of lanes can change from three to two. But I don’t think motorway design is really the problem. I think it’s about how people drive.\n“But I also think darkness is a problem. I drive mainly in the daytime but I know it can be difficult at night. Lighting is really important and is needed.\n“I know flooding on the M65 has been a worry too. And a few weeks ago there was snow and one lane was blocked. But, for me, lighting is really needed. It’s dark for long periods in December and January. Thankfully, the evenings will get a bit lighter in February and March.”\nHear all the latest news from across the UK on the hour, every hour, on Greatest Hits Radio on DAB, smartspeaker, at greatesthitsradio.co.uk, and on the Rayo app.",
