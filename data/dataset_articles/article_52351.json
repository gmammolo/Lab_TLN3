  "text": "It is finally the end of January. Of those who made New Year resolutions to put on shape, only the laggards remain on the running tape.\nMost of us are seeing that the direct debit leaves our accounts collapsed on the couch in a veil of pringle dust.\nYou can see a gym user for the first time. They will fight with the omnipresent Mechanism of ‘Push Knob and Libere’, before addressing the bicycles or running tapes; easier to operate without prior knowledge.\nA gender division arises here. You would expect that all beginners act as female rookies tend to: shy, apologizing, with the aim of causing a minimum inconvenience to others.\nBut there is no modesty for beginners in the user of the male gym. His lack of shame continues until they become an unpleasant grunt of squat shelf, while even the most heartbreaking women are quiet and considered.\nI am not fond of exercise, but as a user of perennial gym, my hours dedicated to observing others have taught me one thing: all men should be prohibited from gyms.\nI’m not alone: ​​this week, a survey discovered that women are being possible to completely gym to the dominant men. So here is my anti-man-ske.\nThe shame of the body, of course, does not take place in the gym. But each rule has its exception, and the exception here are men. We have, of course, Paul Mescal to blame the epidemic of small shorts that sweep the male species.\nThis week, a survey discovered that women are being discouraged going to the gym completely by dominant men.\nA man in my gym of eastern London has adopted the trend, but seems unknown to the limitations of the garment, which leads to some unfortunate malfunction of the costume when using the running tape or the leg press. It is a distraction, for saying at least.\nOther men have an inclination to get their shirts while they make cardio (I’ve never seen a woman do the same). The problem with this is that the shirts have the fortuitous ability to absorb sweat.\nWhen he pursues a better personal upper part, his sweat will travel, dripping on the machines.\nWhich would be fine if a) said that the men cleaned the team later, yb) they shower thoroughly. Often, it is not the case either.\nA friend told me that in the changing rooms of men there is a sign that asks people to give up properly when the smell became so atrocious. Such a sign in the ladies did not arise.\nAnd users of male gyms seem to remain younger. A group of prepubescent now comes together to my gym. They locate the nearest young woman, meet in the line of the eyes and begin to curl free weights, while one of them acts as a cameraman.\nThe filmed video and the published images, the weights fall (rarely are returned to the shelf) and the process is repeated in the Pull-Up bar, where even the most vigorous number cannot lift the body weight. Harmless? It is not for women under their peacock calls to ‘go to the boy’.\nAdults are not much better. It is good to use each piece of equipment only as long as necessary. That means brief breaks between series and without displacement of Tiktok in the weight bank. Men, however, do not seem to possess this self -awareness, and with a tail they form, they will sit watching motivating videos while breathing.\nThey never seem to grow from photographic habit. And yes, I know that gyms are also guilty of establishing tripods to film chest presses. Here I must deploy the female privilege of double ratings to give all men a public service announcement. No woman wants to see your ‘flexible selfie’. It won’t make us imagine in Tinder. I’m sorry.\nBut there are much more serious concerns about the use of the phone while exercising. You are rarely alone in a gym and others can end in a shot.\nThere is a tacit rule of shared vulnerability among gymnastics users: we are all terrible and our wobbly parts are on display and, as the new survey discovered, many women fear being judged for their use of gymnastics.\nWhen you break that trust and share an image of anyone, but particularly a woman, exercising, invite ridicule, trolling and harassment.\nSo what is the solution? Do we reject the mixed gyms or do we promulgate segregated gender hours?\nIt would not be bad not to talk to a man in the gym. A quarter of the women surveyed said they had received unre requested comments from men in the gym. If I had a pound for every time my “form” corrected for a man with a muscular vest, I could pay a much more expensive gym.\nOnce I was on a running tape with a man who, although he had the headphones on, tried to start a conversation. I was so distracted that I had the cords of my trainers trapped in the mechanism and flown, hitting my head on the floor and tear my leggings. At least he apologized.\nDo these men feel a similar frustration towards me? Probably. Make the running ribbons, leave the shoulder pressure on the lighter weights and rarely take all the effort.\nBut maybe they would encourage me to take it seriously if, like all the other women, I did not risk the ridiculous and humiliation of groan pigs in coaches.\n(Tagstotranslate) Dailymail (T) Fumail (T) Tiktok (T) Paul Mescal (T) Tinder",
