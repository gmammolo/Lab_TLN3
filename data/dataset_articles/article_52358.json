  "text": "Another Tournament of Champions clash, another Final Jeopardy! stumble. This time, it was Latin tripping up our brainiacs, as none of the three contestants correctly identified Queen Elizabeth II’s infamous “annus horribilis.” The gaffe left the door open for Ryan Manton, a systems administrator from Columbus, Ohio, to sneak away with a victory despite missing the final question.\nGoing into Final Jeopardy!, Will Stewart, a political organizer, held a slim lead with $14,900, followed closely by Ryan at $14,400. Software engineer Mehal Shah trailed significantly with $7,400. The stage seemed set for a nail-biting finish, especially considering the relatively straightforward category: Latin Phrases. However, the clue about the Queen’s disastrous 1992 proved more challenging than anticipated. All three whiffed, leaving the outcome to be determined by wagering strategy.\nWill, perhaps overconfident in his lead, bet a hefty $13,900 plummeting to a mere $900. Mehal, with little to lose, wagered $7,001, leaving her with a paltry $399. Ryan, wisely wagering a conservative $501, emerged victorious with $13,899. While his win was less a triumph of knowledge and more down to strategic betting, a win’s a win in the cutthroat world of Jeopardy!\nEarlier in the game, Will had seemed poised to dominate. He made a significant leap with a successful Daily Double wager in “Communication,” correctly identifying Estonian. However, he strangely held back on the very next clue, a Daily Double in “Authors,” betting a mere $100 on a question about Sinclair Lewis’s Babbitt. This hesitancy ultimately cost him the game, proving that aggressive wagering is often key to Tournament of Champions success.\nJeopardy airs weekdays in Syndication. Check local listings.",
