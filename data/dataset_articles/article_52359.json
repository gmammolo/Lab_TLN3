  "text": "KANSAS CITY, MO (Dakota News Now) -After a tight start to the game, a big run to close out the first for Kansas City gave the Roos an advantage the South Dakota women’s basketball team couldn’t overcome, resulting in a 77-54 win for the home team Thursday night.\nFour Coyotes scored in double figures, but they were the only four Coyotes to score until the final two minutes of the contest. Carley Duffney led the way with 17 points. Larkins was second on the team with 13 points, but she led the Coyotes with eight rebounds and seven assists. The other two Coyotes in double figures were Alexi Hempe and Cassidy Carson, both with 11 points.\nThe Yotes and Roos played a tight first seven minutes, with Kansas City holding a 12-10 lead, but an 11-0 run to end the first quarter gave the Roos a 23-10 lead after 10 minutes.\nThe Coyotes buried triples on the first two possessions of the second quarter, and after a quick 5-0 run, it was 30-21 with 5:45 to play in the half. Again, the Roos went on a run, outscoring the Yotes 15-6 over the final five-and-a-half minutes to balloon the lead to 18 at the intermission.\nCarley Duffney scored 14 first-half points as the Roos played strong defense on the Coyotes’ leading scorer Grace Larkins, holding her to two points. Cassidy Carson had eight of her 11 in the second quarter to keep the Coyotes within striking distance. Kansas City hit over 50% of their shots in the first half to build the advantage.\nKansas City continued to keep the pressure on in the second half. Larkins got rolling by scoring 11 points in the half. A 9-0 run in the fourth quarter gave the Yotes life, but it was too late to complete a comeback.\nThe Coyotes shot below their season average, hitting 35.8% (19-53) from the field at 32.4% from three. The Roos, who were a 39.3% shooting team on the season, and 24.6% from beyond the arc, managed nearly 51% from the floor and hit two-thirds of their three pointers (10-15).\nSouth Dakota has now fallen in their last four contests, marking the second time this season that the Yotes have dropped four consecutive games. They host North Dakota at 2 p.m. Saturday inside the Sanford Coyote Sports Center.\nNOTABLES\n• The Coyotes are now 9-13 on the season, 3-5 in conference play, and 1-6 on the road.\n• Four Coyotes scored in double figures for the first time since the Northern Arizona game on Dec. 7\n• Carley Duffney led the Coyotes in points with 17, marking the second time this season and 11th time in her career where she led the team.\n• Grace Larkins mustered 13 points, and the led Yotes in rebounds (8) and assists (7).\n• Alexi Hempe and Cassidy Carson scored 11 points each.\n• The Coyotes committed a season low seven fouls.\nCopyright 2025 Dakota News Now.
