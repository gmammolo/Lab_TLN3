  "text": "Oilers give up two-goal lead in shootout loss to Red Wings\nThe Detroit Red Wings overcame a two-goal deficit to defeat the Edmonton Oilers 3-2 in a shootout, marking their fourth consecutive victory. Lucas Raymond secured the win with the decisive shootout goal after Dylan Larkin's regulation strike and an earlier goal from Michael Rasmussen helped rally the Wings. Despite the loss, the Oilers remain strong with recent form, winning 11 of their last 15 games. Key performances included 44 saves from Red Wings' goalie Alex Lyon and 33 stops from Oilers' Stuart Skinner.\n- Leon Draisaitl leads the NHL with 18 points from game-opening goals this season.\n- Dylan Larkin has amassed 10 goals and 22 points in 17 games since Todd McLellan became head coach.\n- The Red Wings have significantly improved, going 12-4-1 since the coaching change on December 26.\n- Edmonton halted its three-game winning streak but remains competitive with strong overall performance.\nThe Red Wings will face the Calgary Flames on Saturday, while the Oilers will host the Toronto Maple Leafs on the same day.\nBottom LineThis shootout loss highlights both teams' strengths and weaknesses, with the Oilers needing to secure tighter finishes to maintain their playoff position as the season progresses.\nRead more at Sportsnet.ca\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
