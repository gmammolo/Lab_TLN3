  "text": "Kennesaw State’s Home Win Streak Ends with 76-68 Loss to Liberty\nKennesaw State’s home win streak ended at nine games with a 76-68 loss to Liberty, as poor three-point shooting plagued the Owls. KSU's record fell to 12-9 and 4-4 in Conference USA, while Liberty improved to 17-4 and 5-3 in conference play. KSU struggled significantly from beyond the arc, connecting on only six of 32 attempts, translating to an 18.8% success rate. Liberty capitalized with 11 of 26 three-pointers, outscoring KSU by 15 points in that area. The loss marks KSU's first home defeat of the season.\n- Kennesaw State shot 18.8% (6-of-32) from three-point range.\n- Liberty shot 42.3% (11-of-26) from beyond the arc.\n- KSU struggled despite a 45-27 rebounding advantage.\n- Wooley led KSU with 22 points, while Weir recorded a double-double with 13 points and 13 rebounds.\n- Kennesaw State is currently positioned 4-4 in Conference USA after the loss.\n- The loss snapped a two-game win streak against Liberty.\n- KSU will look to rebound against FIU at home next.\nKSU hosts FIU for their next game on Saturday, February 1, at 5 p.m. The Owls will aim to bounce back from their home loss and improve their conference record.\nBottom LineThe Owls need to address their three-point shooting struggles to compete effectively moving forward, especially with the next match against FIU on the horizon. The team's rebounding strength may not be enough if offensive shortcomings persist.\nRead more at Kennesaw State University Athletics\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
