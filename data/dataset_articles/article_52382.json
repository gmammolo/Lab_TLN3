  "text": "Kajol’s Sister Tanishaa Wishes Mom Tanuja Didn’t Work: ‘Women Should Be Home With Children’\nTanishaa Mukherjee said she missed Tanuja growing up and that mothers should not work for five years after giving birth.\nVeteran actress Tanuja married Shomu Mukherjee and had two daughters, Kajol and Tanishaa. However, after they got divorced, Tanuja had to work relentlessly to support her daughters and run the household. In a conversation with Hautterfly, Tanishaa Mukherjee opened up about Tanuja being away for long hours. She said she wished her mother didn’t have to work so much and opined that women should not work for at least five years after having a child.\nTanishaa said, “I would say my mom was a working woman, but I wish she wasn’t. When I was born, my mother had to work to support our family. We didn’t have enough money then. My mom used to work at least two to three shifts every day. I would never meet my mother but I would still sleep in her room to feel closer to her.\"\nrelated stories\nThe actress mentioned, “I just feel that women should be home with their children because only a mother can really teach the child, bring up the child and give the child the nurturing the child needs. Only a mother can do this. You can’t get this from your school, or nanny, or maid. I am not very big on ‘leave your child and go to work’.\"\n“I strongly feel that if you want to have a child, give that child the first five years of your life. Then do whatever you want. I am very clingy with my mom. It is because of the feeling of being left, so whenever I had her around me, I wouldn’t leave her alone. I still cling to my mummy,\" she mentioned.\nPreviously, in a chat with SCREEN, Tanishaa mentioned that her grandparents helped to raise her. “It’s not easy for single mothers. They have to put food on the table and they have to take care of the baby. Luckily, for her, we lived in a joint family. We were brought up by our grandmother and great-grandmother, So we had three generations bringing us up.\"\nTanishaa Mukherjee became popular after starring in an old season of Bigg Boss. While she was romantically involved with Armaan Kohli back then, Tanishaa is reportedly not dating anyone and has no plans to get married anytime soon.\n- Location :\n- First Published:\nNews\nmoviesKajol’s Sister Tanishaa Wishes Mom Tanuja Didn’t Work: ‘Women Should Be Home With Children’",
