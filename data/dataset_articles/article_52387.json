I’ll bear that in mind……”\nThis isn’t the first time Blue, 25, has left viewers horrified.\nDays ago, the Brit gave her followers a close-up look at the shocking aftermath of her jaw-dropping sex stunt, which left her covered in painful bruises and bite marks.\nIn a shocking clip posted on Blue's official YouTube account, the sex worker was joined by Josh Lee Spooner, 27, a documentary maker and photographer with 15,900 followers on Instagram.\nAlongside the video, Blue said: \"Thank you to all the dads, sons, grandads and husbands that helped make this possible.\"\nWhen discussing having slept with 1,057 men in just 12 hours, Blue, who wore only a jumper and a pair of knickers, shockingly claimed: \"A number I am very proud of.\"\nAnd it's not just her that is \"proud\" of her record break, as she added: \"You'll think I'm joking, my family are so proud of what I do.\"\nBut despite feeling \"proud,\" Blue then got candid on the toll the sex marathon took on her body.\nAs she stood up and pointed to her bruises, she confessed: \"I think they're fingerprints to be honest. I've got bite marks.\n\"My legs feel the most sore, but apart from that, I’m ready for round two.\"\nIt wasn't just her legs with war wounds, as podcast host Spooner – whose main ventures seem to be promoting gym products, appearing on podcasts and discussing business strategies, alongside helping to produce long form videos – also spotted painful looking marks on her neck.\nBut Bonnie wasn't phased in the slightest, declaring about her sex partners: \"I say to them all the time – the dads, the husbands, the students – leave your mark on me. Bite me, make me yours for that amount of time.\"\nShe also claimed: “I enjoy it, when they've left marks, whether it's hand prints, bite marks, bruises.\n\"I’m ok with that, I quite like it. It's a bit of a turn on actually.\n\"Last night was the sorest I've ever felt but today I'm fine.\"",
