  "text": "Editor: I would like to congratulate Greg Lewis for being inducted into the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame. Having come to Aspen in December 1980 for a one-week vacation and choosing to stay, I too have witnessed the many losses of places to dine. To Greg’s aptly written ode to cherished places (“ Food for thought: Aspen’s lost its cherished places ,” Jan. 26, Aspen Daily News) I would like to add: The Souper, Burger Brothers, Poppies, Szechuan Gardens, R Pea’s, Bentley’s, La Cantina, Aspen Bar & Grill, Planet Hollywood, Aspen Grove Cafe, Milan’s, Cooper Street Pier, Pour la France, Ebbe’s and even McDonald’s, which I miss for a vanilla shake on a hot summer day before jumping on the bus to Glenwood. There are more, but their names escape me. I have never claimed to be a local; I enjoy reading columns by Roger Marolt and Lo Semple. Greg, being on ski patrol, you probably remember early mornings gathering at Ruthie’s on Aspen Mountain (1987). I enjoyed working at the little ski shop there, selling film, sunscreen, sunglasses and tourist stuff — also long gone. I am now enjoying retirement in Glenwood Springs. Visiting Aspen is like going to another planet. Kendall Christianson Glenwood Springs",
