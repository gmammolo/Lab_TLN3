  "text": "Virat Kohli’s much-anticipated return to the Ranji Trophy ended on a disappointing note as he failed to make a significant impact. Playing for Delhi against the Railways at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, Kohli’s performance fell short of expectations. The crowd, which had gathered in large numbers to witness his comeback, was left disappointed as Kohli struggled at the crease.\nKohli, who last played domestic cricket over a decade ago, was expected to shine in his first innings back. However, he was dismissed for a mere 6 runs, failing to live up to the high expectations set by his fans. Despite his vast experience and past successes, Kohli’s recent form has been a concern, and this match was no exception.\nThe match saw Delhi resume their first innings at 41/1, with Kohli’s early dismissal adding to the pressure on the team. The atmosphere in the stadium, which had been electric with chants of “Kohli, Kohli,” turned somber as the reality of his performance set in. Fans, who had hoped to see their cricketing hero in action, were left disheartened by the outcome.\nWhile Kohli’s return to domestic cricket was a significant event, his performance in this match was a reminder that even legends have off days. The hope now is that he can regain his form and continue to inspire fans with his exceptional play in future matches",
