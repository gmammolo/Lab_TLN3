  "text": "Cougars’ Heartbreaking 70-68 Loss to Pacific in Nail-Biter\nWashington State men's basketball suffered a close loss to Pacific, falling 70-68 in a heated match at the Alex G. Spanos Center. The game saw numerous lead changes and ties, with Pacific clinching the lead in the final seconds. With this defeat, the Cougars' record drops to 15-8 and 5-5 in WCC play. Despite a strong performance from Dane Erikstrup, who led the team with 17 points, WSU struggled with rebounding, which ultimately impacted the outcome.\n- Dane Erikstrup scored 17 points, achieving a season-high in assists (4) and steals (4).\n- Washington State shot 47% from three-point range but was outrebounded by Pacific 34-24.\nAlthough Washington State excelled in three-point shooting, their significant rebounding deficit and inability to secure offensive boards hindered their chances for victory. The Cougars have struggled on the road, falling to 3-4 in away games this season.\nState of Play- The loss marked Washington State's second consecutive defeat.\n- Pacific's tightly contested win improved their all-time record against WSU to 2-0.\nWSU heads to San Francisco for their next match-up on Saturday at 7 p.m. This road game presents an opportunity for the Cougars to rebound and improve their away game performance.\nBottom LineWashington State needs to address its rebounding issues while leveraging its three-point ability to improve its chances in upcoming matches. Continuous reliance on perimeter shooting without solid inside play may limit the Cougars' success as they navigate the rest of the WCC season.\nRead more at Washington State University Athletics\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
