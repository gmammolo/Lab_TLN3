  "text": "I don't like how scrolling makes me feel these days. Every headline, meme, and take I scroll past leaves me feeling worse about the world. It isn't entirely unwarranted—there's a lot of bad happening—but marinating in that feeling doesn't help.\nScrolling isn't always detrimental, of course. It can be relaxing, for one thing, and it can be a way to keep up with what's happening with your friends. But I think we all know there are diminishing returns when it comes to scrolling—the overall quality goes down the longer you keep going. And that's why reading is possibly more important now than its ever been: There aren't diminishing returns. Scrolling is briefly thinking about lots of things; reading is taking the time to think about one thing.\nThat's why I'm trying to do more reading and less scrolling. Seeing hundreds of memes about the latest dumb thing that one billionaire said doesn't help me reach any of my goals. Taking the time to get context on the issues I care about—and thinking deeply about them—might. So I've been taking active steps to nudge myself toward scrolling less and reading more. I hope these tips will help you achieve the same.\nHide (or uninstall) social media apps\nAre there social media icons on your phone's home screen? The simplest thing you can do in order to scroll less is to get those icons off of there. You can do this by removing the icons from the home screen or by uninstalling the application entirely. Either way, the process is easy: tap and hold on the icon. Both Android and iOS will give you the option to either remove the application from your home screen or delete it.\nI, personally, tend to just remove the apps from my home screen. This reduces the number of times I turn on my phone and reflexively open an app to scroll in, but leaves the applications available when I actively want them.\nThat might not be enough for you, though. You might find yourself going out of your way to scroll even if it means pulling up the app outside the home screen, or sucked in when there's a notification. If that's you, I recommend just uninstalling the application entirely, if only while you're trying to create the habit of scrolling less. It will cut off the problem entirely.\nPut books on your phone\nGetting books onto your phone isn't hard. There are the big apps, including Kindle and Kobo, if you want to purchase current titles. (Apple has its own proprietary \"Books\" app as well.) You can access millions of books in the public domain with a little bit of searching. And there's also a good chance your local library offers free e-books: Libby is a common app for this.\nSet up one or multiple of these applications and put them right on the home screen of your phone. Ideally, you'll put the icon right where the social application you used to open constantly lives. The idea is to trick yourself into opening books. This isn't magic—you're going to need to force yourself to actually read. Over time, though, the habit may begin to form.\nAnother thing to consider: audiobooks. Some people can't get into reading no matter how hard they try. Others can't find the time. In either case, I think audiobooks can be a great alternative. Listening to a book while driving, cleaning the house, or just hanging out at home is a great way to take in and reflect on books. Some people get elitist about this—ignore them. Listening to books is great. Most local libraries offer audiobooks, whether in the Libby app or as physical CDs. Otherwise, there are services like Audible and even Spotify to get your audiobook fix.\nMake reading articles easy for yourself\nIf you don't want to read entire books on your phone (I personally don't), you'll likely find its the perfect device for reading articles, and there are plenty of ways to do that without the need to scroll.\nI like having read-it-later apps on my phone's home screen. These let you save articles you find on the web for future reading. I tend to clip articles during my work day, when I shouldn't be reading, and come back to them in the evening. I personally use FlyLeaf, which is a great option for Apple users, but Instapaper is also a very good tool for the job.\nBut it's also a good idea to have a few publications that you browse regularly. There are all kinds of ways to do this. The simplest is to bookmark the homepages of a few of your favorite websites and blogs so that they show up every time you open your browser. The more techie solution is to find an RSS reader, which shows you the headlines from as many websites as you like. That way, you can keep up with everything in one place.\nOr, you could look into apps that let you read entire print publications. I recently discovered Press Reader, which offers full versions of magazines and newspapers. It's offered for free by some libraries and lets you read the entire print version of all sorts of publications. Odds are your local library has something similar, or you could physically go there and read the magazine they have on the shelf. (I love doing this.)\nMange your notifications\nNothing disrupts reading faster than being pulled into something else. If you're actually going to read, take advantage of your phone's Do Not Disturb (DND) functionality. We've talked a bit about how to customize your Android notifications and your iOS notifications, so dig into those articles for more details. But the gist is you don't want notifications popping up when you're trying to read. You can turn DND modes on or off manually, if you want, but can also schedule them. For example, if you read before bed, you could set up your phone to never buzz during your usual nighttime routine.\nYou can get fancy about this: Newer Apple devices can use AI to filter out all but the most important notifications. I've tried this feature and so far it's a great way to unplug without missing the important stuff.\nSwap out your phone for something else\nI've been talking about phones a lot in this article because that's where the bulk of scrolling happens. If you really want to read more, though, it's probably a good idea to do it on something other than your phone. E-ink devices work, but so do paper books and magazines. It's literally impossible to scroll Reddit on a book.\nDepending on how your brain works, though, a new gadget might help. My colleague Joel Cunningham wrote about how the Boox Portable helped him stop doomscrolling, and I can can understand why. This is basically an e-ink Android device, roughly the size of a phone. If you want something bigger, you can look into an e-ink tablet. These are great for both reading and jotting down ideas. I personally use a Remarkable for reading papers and researching articles. Getting away from my colorful and animated computing devices for a bit is helpful. There are all kinds of e-ink devices out there that can give you the best of both paper and electronics. Look into them—they might be what you need to trick your brain into reading more.",
