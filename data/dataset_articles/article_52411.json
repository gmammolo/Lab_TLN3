Uss influencer ko dekho, voh kaise baat karta hai.’”\nHe was approaching it with his own interpretation.\n“But they wanted me to follow a particular tone or prototype typical of travel bloggers. That was a bit challenging because I had no real exposure to it. However, it was fun to step out of my comfort zone and learn something new!”\nIn “The Secret of the Shiledars” Rajeev will be seen in a completely new avatar as he takes on the role of a historical travel blogger. He embarks on a thrilling treasure hunt that blends the past and the present, uncovering the legacy of the legendary Shiledars.\nThe series narrates the story of the Shiledars —stalwart defenders and trusted stewards whose unwavering dedication shaped the course of an era. Directed by Munjya fame , Aditya Sarpotdar, starring Rajeev along with Sai Tamhankar, Gaurav Amlani and Ashish Vidyarthi the series releases from January 31 on Disney+ Hotstar.\nTalking about the show previously, director Aditya had said, “Growing up, I have always been enticed by stories of adventure and history, they have always kept me curious. One such curiosity led to the inception of The Secret of the Shiledars. The concept of ‘Shiledars’, The Guardians, hasn’t been explored before, making it intriguing yet fulfilling”.\nHe further mentioned, “I believe that The Secret of the Shiledars is the project that challenged me and made me move out of my comfort zone and I am so glad that I could embark on this journey with Rajeev Khandelwal as he has truly given his heart and soul to it and I am sure it will reflect on screen”.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",
