  "text": "Cricket News\nVirat Kohli fails to fire again as Ranji Trophy comeback hype vanishes into thin air\nVirat Kohli's comeback to Ranji Trophy was met with disappointment after the senior player failed to play an impactful knock for Delhi in the first innings against Railway in the Elite Group D match at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi.\nNew Delhi: The raucous crowd at the Arun Jaitley Stadium was brought to silence after Virat Kohli was dismissed for just six runs in his Ranji Trophy comeback game for Delhi against Railways. This was a big disappointment for many as the excitement was crushed.\nIf Railways pacer Himanshu Sangwan has admired Australian skipper Pat Cummins at any point of his career then he would have certainly enjoyed that moment. Watching the crowd go silent. It was that one exemplary delivery that sent the off-stump of Kohli for a ride.\n[pic.twitter.com/9yHaMc69BM]— Follow @Legenddhonii (@fuckusuar_)[January 31, 2025]\nKohli walked back to the dugout after adding just six runs from 15 deliveries he faced in an innings in domestic cricket, which he played after 12 long years. It was the fuller length with a straight ball which came in slightly to expose the bat and pad gap before the off-stump was on a trip with a cartwheeling move.\nThe non-home crowd factor\nThe wait to watch the senior cricketer didn’t justify with the player not being able to adapt to the conditions, which he dominated in the formative years of his career. The dejection was quite evident as the crowd left the stands because they had come to watch Kohli do his magic with his willow. The joy lasted for only one boundary that came just before the dismissal.\nIt was for that moment when the crowd were eagerly waiting for either of Yash Dhull or Sanat Sangwan to depart. The uuhs and aahs were audible whenever Dhull’s edge went through the slip cordon. It was that tangibility to watch the icon at the crease more than the cause of Delhi team bagging a substantial lead. In the lexicons of cricket, with the most idealistic way, the crowd should be termed as the home crowd, but than it was pulled by the aura of one player. And the stands were emptied the moment that player was dismissed.\nClick for more latest Cricket news. Also get top headlines and latest news from India and around the world at News9.",
