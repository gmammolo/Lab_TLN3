  "text": "Rising comedy star Kenyi Flores died on Tuesday. He was 28.\nThe Los Angeles Medical Examiner’s Office has not yet determined the cause of death, stating that the case is still under investigation, according to officials.\nFlores’s manager Cameron Silzle didn’t immediately return a request for comment from NTD.\nFlores, born June 10, 1996, had been making waves in the Los Angeles comedy scene and quickly became a beloved figure among fellow comedians and audiences alike. His sudden death has sent shockwaves through the entertainment community.\nThe comedian’s family announced his death on his Facebook page, which boasts over 277,000 followers. “It is with great sadness that we confirm the untimely passing of our friend, brother, and son, Kenyi Flores. Please respect our privacy at this time as we are all shocked and devastated by this loss,” the statement read.\nFans and fellow comedians expressed their grief and shared memories of Flores on social media.\nOne fan, identified as Chamorrita Britty, commented on the Facebook post, recalling a recent performance she attended: “I just saw him live on tour in Portland earlier this month, January 11th. He was so proud to go from opening on a Thursday to headlining five SOLD-OUT shows during primetime, Friday through Sunday.”\nFlores had recently begun his “Butterfly Effect” tour, which began Jan. 10 in Portland, Oregon, and was scheduled to finish in San Diego on April 19. His last performance was in Norcross, Georgia.\nFellow comedian Gabriel Iglesias shared his thoughts with the Los Angeles Times, saying, “I feel honored to have spent time with Ken. Of course he was hilarious but above all he was kind, respectful and fun to be around. He will be missed.”\nComedian Jo Koy, who was on a USO tour in Japan when he heard the news, told the Los Angeles Times he was “crushed” by Flores’ passing. “I would always check on him, I truly loved this guy,” Koy said. “I literally posted about a pic of his tour schedule a couple days before he passed. It’s all so crazy.”\nFlores had recently celebrated a personal milestone, sharing on social media platform X that he had completed several tour shows without drinking alcohol. “So I started my tour a couple weeks ago and I’m proud to say I’ve done every single show, 5 in Portland 1 in Albuquerque and 4 in Atlanta without a single drop of alcohol,” he wrote.\nHe said he wasn’t sober but just wanted to take a break. “Nervous for Phoenix next weekend but I think I got it. I’m not sober just wanna chill a bit,” Flores wrote.",
