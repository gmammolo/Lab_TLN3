The media personality disclosed that her personal experience from her first marriage with Lamar Odom helped her to face the complex situation.\nKhloe Kardashian said, “Well the crazy thing is I would draw back to the feelings I had with Lamar.” She continued, “Lamar was my first husband —where I would say, ‘Okay.’ I knew how to deal with this media scandal.” The media personality further explained, “And I just knew sort of to stay away from the noise, which L.A. has a lot of noise.” “Stayed away from my phone, but I would say the biggest was I had a brand new baby and I definitely isolated,” she added.\nHowever, Khloe Kardashian revealed that she “wasn’t in denial about all the noise.” She “didn’t want to pay attention to it. The star further talked about why she let Tristan Thompson stay during True’s delivery.

She expressed, “I was thinking for my daughter True.” “I thought of her. I was like, ‘For her memories, I want her to know her dad was in the room,” she further explained.",
