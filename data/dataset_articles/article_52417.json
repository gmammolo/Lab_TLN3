  "text": "Phuket booze ban begins as election showdown heats up\nThailand’s nationwide alcohol ban kicks in at 6pm today, leaving Phuket tourists dry for 24 hours as the country gears up for the Provincial Administration Organisation (PAO) elections tomorrow, February 1.\nUnder Thai election law, the sale of alcohol is strictly prohibited during voting periods. Those caught flouting the rule face harsh penalties, including fines of up to 10,000 baht, six months in jail, or both. Officials have issued strong warnings ahead of the election, urging compliance.\nMeanwhile, the battle for the presidency of the Phuket Provincial Administration Organisation (PPAO) has reached fever pitch. Three candidates are vying for the top seat, but all eyes are on two frontrunners: Lersak Leenanitikul of the People’s Party and former PPAO President Rewat Areerob.\nIn a high-stakes debate at Phuket Rajabhat University last Sunday, January 26 both candidates doubled down on their key policies. Lersak, a former deputy director of Vachira Phuket Hospital, is running under ballot No.2, backed by big names including former Move Forward Party leader Pita Limjaroenrat. His campaign promises include:\n- Overhauling Phuket’s public transport system.\n- Introducing trilingual schools and vocational real-life education.\n- Expanding healthcare with universal cancer screening and 24-hour clinics.\n- Tackling flooding, wastewater issues, and ensuring clean water access.\n- Increasing support for the elderly in need.\nPita hailed Lersak as “the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle” for Phuket’s transformation, highlighting urgent issues like crime, road safety, and healthcare.\nOn the other side, Rewat, running for re-election under ballot No.1, staged a major rally at Phuket Merlin Hotel, promising real change under the slogan: “We do it for real, not selling dreams.” His campaign focuses on:\n- Expanding mass transit and secondary road projects.\n- Strengthening disaster prevention and launching Phuket Alert.\n- Boosting telemedicine, emergency services, and traditional Thai medicine.\n- Promoting AI education and lifelong learning.\n- Advancing environmental sustainability and carbon neutrality.\n- Developing world-class sports facilities and positioning Phuket as a health hub.\n- Supporting local businesses, international festivals, and cultural heritage.\n- Empowering youth through the Next New Gen initiative.\nRewat pointed to his pandemic leadership, citing successful vaccine rollouts, quarantine centres, and economic recovery efforts.\n“We’ve laid the foundations—now let’s take Phuket to the next level.”\nWith tensions high and policies clashing, Phuket voters face a crucial decision tomorrow. The election will determine the island’s future, but for now, residents and tourists alike will have to endure a dry spell as the alcohol ban remains in force until 6pm tomorrow, reported The Phuket News.\nThe Election Commission (EC) warned against alcohol sales and parties today, January 31, until tomorrow, February 1, throughout Thailand, except in Bangkok.\nToday, the EC issued a warning to the public regarding the upcoming election of PAO members and PAO presidents, set to take place tomorrow. From 6pm today, January 31 until 6pm on election day tomorrow, February 1, the sale, distribution, and serving of alcohol are strictly prohibited in all 76 constituencies outside Bangkok.\nViolators of this regulation may face imprisonment and fines.\nLatest Thailand News",
