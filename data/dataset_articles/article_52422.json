Records: UC Davis 12-9 (6-4 Big West), UC Riverside 14-8 (7-3 Big West) The short story: It was a heart breaker on the road for UC Davis, falling to UC Riverside 60-58 on a last-second three-pointer by Nate Pickens with just four seconds remaining. Despite a valiant effort that included a game-high 20 points from TY Johnson and a near double-double from Niko Rocak, the Aggies couldn't hold off the Highlanders in a game that featured 12 lead changes throughout the night. COURT SIDE Johnson, the senior from Chicago, led the Aggies with 20 points, eight rebounds, and two steals This was Johnson's 13th game this season scoring 20 or more points, and 35th of his career Connor Sevilla continued dialing it in from distance with three crucial three-pointers on his way to 15 points on the night Rocak filled up the box score and had a near double-double, scoring eight points to go along with 10 rebounds, four assists, and two blocks UC Davis won the rebounding battle 34-33, largely in part to Rocak's 10 boards leading the way The Aggie defense forced 12 turnovers, converting them into 15 points on the other end UC Davis shot 41.4% from the field (24-58) UC Riverside's Kaleb Smith and Rikus Schulte combined for 24 points, while Pickens hit the game-winning three-pointer, his only basket of the game HOW IT HAPPENED UC Davis opened the game with a strong defensive effort, holding UC Riverside to just one point in the first five minutes and building an 8-1 lead The Aggies asserted their presence inside early, scoring 14 of their 26 first-half points in the painted area which set the tone for the first 20 minutes UC Riverside responded with a 7-0 run to take a 20-16 lead, but the Aggies closed the half strong A late three-pointer from Johnson capped a 6-0 run, giving UC Davis a 26-24 halftime advantage The second half was a back-and-forth battle much like the first-half, with neither team leading by more than six points UC Davis surged ahead 34-30 after a jumper from Sevilla, but UC Riverside answered with a 7-0 run, fueled by a pair of baskets from Schulte to retake the lead Sevilla's perimeter scoring which ignited the previous run, would again spark another Aggie scoring portion of the game, hitting three three-pointers in the final eight minutes, including one to tie the game at 40-40 The back-and-forth action would continue to progress into the final stages of the game with eight of the games 12 lead changes taking place after the game was tied up at the 40-40 score Helping the Aggies trade baskets with the Highlanders not only was Sevilla but Carl Daughtery Jr., who scored all nine of his points in the second half A seemingly pivotal moment came with 49 seconds left when a reversed call gave UC Davis possession with a 56-55 lead Johnson capitalized with a clutch pull-up jumper to extend the lead to 58-55 with 30 seconds remaining UC Riverside responded with two free throws from Barrington Hargress and forced a turnover on the ensuing possession With four seconds left, Pickens hit the game-winning three-pointer, his only basket of the night UC Davis had one final chance, but Johnson's three-point attempt at the buzzer rimmed out TY doing what he does 💪📺 ESPN+ pic.twitter.com/GqB9vKWlbf— UC Davis Men's Basketball (@ucdavismbb) January 31, 2025 UP NEXT: UC Davis will continue their road-stand with a trip to first-place UC Irvine this Saturday, Feb. 1 at 1 p.m. PT.Print Friendly Version Read Full Article",
