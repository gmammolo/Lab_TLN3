  "text": "Table of Contents\nJustin Bieber has been making headlines recently for his relationship with his wife Hailey Bieber. While the singer has been off the charts for some time now and has been facing health issues, the internet has theories that his relationship with his wife could be strained. To add to it, his latest appearance in New York City on Wednesday raised more eyebrows as he looked visibly tense and hollow-eyed. His condition further fueled the speculations about potential marital issues with his wife. Notably, this comes after the parents to Jack Blues Bieber were spotted recently during a date night together over the weekend.\nHowever, fans and users on the internet have come out in support of the Baby singer.\nJustin Bieber spotted looking hollow-eyed in New York\nThe Kiss Me singer was spotted in New York sporting wearing his signature dishevelled-chic look, with a bright yellow hoodie, baggy cargo pants, and fuzzy slipper-like shoes. The singer was seen walking through the bustling streets of New York City when his dramatic gesture of grabbing his crotch grabbed eyeballs.\nHe was also seen wearing a black baseball cap as walked towards his luxury SUV parked around the corner. Meanwhile, Hailey was spotted leaving a building in Union Square all alone.\nTheir separate appearances come after recent rumours of a tumultuous marriage. It started when Bieber unfollowed his wife on Instagram leading to a sea of speculations. However, he later clarified on his Instagram stories saying, “Someone went on my account and unfollowed my wife. Shit is getting suss out here.”\nFans support Justin\nHowever, the internet stood in support of the Mistletoe singer noting that he was a father to a newborn baby and that it was natural for him to be sleep-deprived thus causing the hollow eyes.\nOne user sarcastically noted, “Man, have you ever seen a sleep-deprived first-time father? We all look like that.” Another user defended him saying, “He’s had lime disease and a new baby leave him alone mx”\nOther users noted things like, “He’s a new daddy, cut him some slack. He’s like, “I haven’t slept in 4 years,” “His baby not even 1 yet. That nigga jus tired asf 😭”. Another fan wrote, “The man told yall he was dealing with an illness if not last year the year before. Let that baby live in peace.”\nJustin Bieber and Hailey Bieber have been married for around six years now.
