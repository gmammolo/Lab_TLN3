  "text": "amitabhBachchan's portrayal of Aswaththama was the real star, even though\nprabhasplayed the protagonist. The sheer generosity of Bachchan's on-screen persona and distinctive baritone was too much for even\nprabhasto surpass.\nAccording to recent speculations,\namitabh bachchanmay appear in\nrahulSankrityan's future film, which is directed by Vijay Deverakonda.\nrayalaseemain the 1850s serves as the setting for the film, which promises an engaging plot. Big B and\nvijay deverakondatogether in a\nmovieseems like such an amazing prospect. It may make for a great\nmovieif there are face-off moments between the two. But as seen in\nkalki2898 AD, Bachchan's dominant presence might eclipse VD.\nWe need to see if VD is willing to take the chance of seeing another actor's histrionics shine in a movie. However, Big B's involvement in the project, which is now known as VD14, has not been formally verified, thus they are merely rumors.\nDue to the reunion of\nvijay deverakondaand\nrahul sankrityanfollowing their successful film Taxiwaala, the project has already attracted a lot of attention. Expectations are high because it is being produced by Mythri\nmovieMakers. The fact that Adipurush star Ajay-Atul has been enlisted to write the soundtrack further heightens the anticipation. Arnold Vosloo, actor of The Mummy, has also been confirmed to play a significant part, while renowned cinematographer Éric Gautier, who has worked on movies like Into the Wild and The Motorcycle Diaries, has joined as\ndirectorof photography.",
