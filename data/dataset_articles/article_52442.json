  "text": "It seems like the Australian festival scene truly can’t catch a break. Just when we thought things couldn’t get any worse after Splendour In The Grass pulled the plug on this year’s shindig, Groovin The Moo (GTM) has gone and dropped another bombshell.\nIt’s official, GTM won’t be moo-ving and grooving in 2025.\nAnother one bites the dust. (Image: Groovin The Moo / Instagram) The organisers broke the news on Instagram this afternoon, leaving loyal fans scratching their heads and wondering what’s next for the beloved regional touring festival . In their post, they said that they’re taking a breather to suss out a more sustainable model for the event.\n“Groovin the Moo won’t be happening in 2025, while we work on finding the most sustainable model for Australia’s most loved regional touring festival,” the post read.\n“We will really miss seeing the smiling faces of all our beloved Moo Crew – and that means YOU!”\nWhat is going on??? (Image: Groovin The Moo / Instagram) It seems like they’re still keen to revive the music festival as they called for users to give suggestions of artists they’d like to see in a future line up. Either that, or they’re trying to distract us by giving us hope.\nThis isn’t the first time GTM has hit a rough patch. Last year’s festival got the chop just two weeks after they’d announced their line-up featuring international acts like The Kooks, Melanie C , Jessie Reyez and Stephen Sanchez . They cited insufficient ticket sales as their reason.\nThe lineup that could have been! (Image: Groovin The Moo / Instagram) GTM has been a staple of the Aussie music scene since 2005, bringing big names like Billie Eilish and Denzel Curry to regional spots across the country.\nAlthough the plight for sustainability is admirable, fans are still disappointed with the news.\nOne clever cookie suggested, “Just do a year on and year off in conjunction with Splendour or something of similar size. That way, punters have different festivals to look forward too!”\nThis would be similar to music festivals like Glastonbury that take what is known as a fallow year every four to five years to let the land they use heal and regroup. Aka, I’m hopeful Groovin The Moo will be able to figure something out.\nAnother loyal fan expressed their sadness, saying, “This makes me sad, hope you can revive the Moo cause she’s a beautiful beast! My daughter & I have attended every year in Bendigo.”\n“Sad! We love Groovin as it’s one of the only all ages festivals I can take my kids too,” said another.\nWith Splendour and now GTM taking a hiatus, it’s clear that the Aussie festival scene is in dire need of help. A girlie just wants to buss down in a field!! Here’s hoping they can find a way to make our dreams come true soon!!",
