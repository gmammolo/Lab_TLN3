  "text": "By Samantha Nungesser ,\n6 hours ago\nChef Nick DiGiovanni doesn’t play around when it comes to cooking. On this morning’s episode of The Drew Barrymore Show , the MasterChef alum scolded host Drew Barrymore and Sunny Anderson for grilling him about his dating life.\nThe celebrity chef appeared on the show to teach the duo how to make a Detroit-style pizza. While Barrymore was ready to “motorboat” the dish right when it came out of the oven, DiGiovanni had a few more ingredients he wanted to add before serving it.\nDrew Barrymore’s Daughter Told Her To Thank Her Mom For Bringing Her On Auditions: “None Of This Would’ve Been Possible Without Her Choices”\n“Nick, are you single? What’s going on?” Anderson asked, to which DiGiovanni replied, “I have a girlfriend. But could you help me again? Do you mind?”\nThe chef appeared disinterested in answering any more questions about his relationship, but that didn’t stop Anderson from asking how tall he was.\n“I’m 6’3,” he said, before asking Barrymore to help him out.\nStream It Or Skip It: ‘This Is The Tom Green Documentary’ on Prime Video, A Reflective Look Back For The Canadian Comedian, Host, And Instigator\n“How did you meet your girlfriend?” the actress wondered, while Anderson playfully added, “Yeah, we’re all up in your business, Nick.”\nDiGiovanni quickly fired back, “I’m trying to get away from the girlfriend questions and get help here,” prompting Barrymore to apologize.\nPhoto: CBS CLICK HERE TO GET EMAILS FROM DECIDER\nWhile Barrymore said she was sorry for getting distracting by his personal life, it didn’t stop Anderson from asking how long they had been together.\n“We’ve been dating for six years, actually,” he said, noting that they “met in college.”\nThis isn’t the first time a celebrity chef has put Barrymore in her place on national television. During a February 2024 episode of The Drew Barrymore Show, Chef Mario Carbone got a little more than he asked for when he instructed Barrymore to smash a lobster with a mallet.\n“Look at me, I’m just hanging out with my hammer,” she said, to which he sharply replied, “Please put the hammer down.”\nThe Drew Barrymore Show airs on weekdays on CBS.
