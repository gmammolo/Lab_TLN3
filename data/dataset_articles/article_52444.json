  "text": "The Times: Rolling Stones ruled out holding a European tour in 2025\nLONDON, January 31. /tass/. Members of the British rock band The Rolling Stones Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood have rejected a number of offers to perform in European countries in 2025. This was reported by The Times newspaper.\nAccording to her, they considered various options from competing tour organizers, including visits to Paris, Barcelona, Rome, as well as four concerts at London's Tottenham Hotspur stadium, which seats 60,000 people, but ultimately rejected them. The performance of the band, which remains one of the most popular in the world even more than 60 years after its creation, was hampered by \"problems with concerts and trips, as well as existing obligations,\" the publication says.\nNevertheless, the veteran rockers - 81-year-old Jagger, 81-year-old Richards and 77-year-old Wood - still hope to perform in the UK and other countries in 2026. The last time they organized concerts in the United Kingdom was in 2002, a year after drummer Charlie Watts died at the age of 80.\nIn 2024, they performed 19 concerts in the USA and one in Canada as part of the Hackney Diamonds tour in support of the album of the same name, which became the 24th released in the UK and the 26th in the USA. During the North American tour, which brought in $235 million, over 880,000 tickets were sold.\nThe Rolling Stones, formed in 1962, has long rivaled The Beatles in popularity and is considered one of the most successful bands in the history of rock music. 21 of the ensemble's songs were in the top ten of the UK charts, with 8 of them rising to the top of the charts.",
