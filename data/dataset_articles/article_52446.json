  "text": "Why this $1 massage offer is only valid for rich Chinese women?\nA massage parlour in Shenzhen, China, has gained attention for offering an 80-minute full-body detox massage for just 9 yuan (US$1).\nHowever, to qualify for the discounted service, clients must be women and meet at least one of 27 criteria, proving, they are “exceptionally outstanding,” as reported by the South China Morning Post.\nThe requirements include owning a luxury property, driving high-end cars such as Audi, Mercedes, or Porsche, using an iPhone 16 Pro Max, or possessing luxury bags.\nOther qualifying conditions include employment at leading tech companies like Tencent or Huawei, holding Hong Kong or Macau residency, or having traveled to Europe or the US.\nSocial media influencers with over 500,000 followers, brand founders, and professionals such as doctors and bankers are also eligible.\nA message from the parlour states, “If you do not meet the conditions, keep working hard in 2025!” It claims the purpose is not personal gratification but to encourage customers to strive for a better life.\nStaff confirmed to a mainland media outlet that customers must provide proof of meeting at least one requirement to receive the low-price massage.\nDespite the exclusivity, an anonymous customer noted that the service felt no different from a standard massage. More than 100 orders had been placed as of the latest update.\nThe parlour’s criteria have sparked controversy. Some critics argue that the restrictions could violate China’s Consumer Rights Protection Law, which guarantees fair trade for all consumers.\nOthers have questioned whether this is a marketing tactic targeting high-spending clients for potential upselling.\nExclusive customer identity requirements are not new in China. In August 2024, a swimming club in Jiangsu province only allowed women under 45 with “a high IQ and personal qualities” to join, a policy that also raised concerns about discrimination, according to the South China Morning Post.",
