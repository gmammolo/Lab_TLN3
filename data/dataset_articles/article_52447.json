  "text": "Skyhawks Lose Close Match vs Southeast Missouri Despite Grullon’s 31 Points\nThe University of Tennessee at Martin men's basketball team lost to Southeast Missouri, 90-79, despite Josué Grullon's standout performance of 31 points. Grullon, a junior guard, also contributed 8 rebounds and maintained a perfect free-throw record, going 12-for-12. The Skyhawks were unable to overcome a significant second-half deficit, despite trimming it down to seven points late in the game. Southeast Missouri had a strong team showing with five players scoring in double figures, including Braxton Stacker's 19 points. Skyhawks' head coach Jeremy Shulman emphasized the need to compete and the challenges of the competitive Ohio Valley Conference.\n- Josué Grullon scored a career-high 31 points.\n- UT Martin shot 53.3% (32-for-60) from the field overall.\n- Southeast Missouri shot 63.5% (33-for-52) from the field.\n- Grullon achieved 12-for-12 from the free-throw line, just two makes shy of the school record.\nWhile Grullon's performance was remarkable, the Skyhawks struggled overall, particularly in defending against Southeast Missouri's high shooting percentage. Coach Shulman's acknowledgment of the team's readiness highlights a broader issue of consistency in performance against top-tier opponents.\nState of Play- The loss puts UT Martin at 9-13 overall and 5-6 in the Ohio Valley Conference.\n- Southeast Missouri improves to 12-10 overall and 7-4 in the OVC.\n- UT Martin fought back from a 19-point deficit but could not close the gap in the final moments.\nThe Skyhawks are set to face Little Rock on February 1, with the game nationally televised on ESPNU. This matchup provides an opportunity for UT Martin to rebound and showcase their skills against a different opponent.\nBottom LineDespite Grullon's impressive scoring, the Skyhawks must enhance their overall team performance to compete more effectively within the Ohio Valley Conference. Consistency and defensive strategies will be critical in their upcoming games.\nRead more at UTM Athletics\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
