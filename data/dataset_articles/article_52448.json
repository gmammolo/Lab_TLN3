Despite a comeback from a 13-point deficit to tie the game at 59, WKU closed the game with an 8-0 run. UTEP struggled with shooting, hitting 40.4% overall and only 23.8% from three-point range. Ivane Tensaie led the Miners with 18 points, while Luisa Vydrova and Dunja Zecevic each contributed 10 points. Coach Keitha Adams highlighted ongoing rebounding issues as a key reason for the loss.\nBy the Numbers- UTEP shot 40.4% (23-57) from the field and 23.8% (5-21) from three-point range.\n- WKU led the game with a 41.8% field goal percentage (23-55) and a dominant 78.9% from the free-throw line (15-19).\nDespite a closely contested match-up, UTEP's inability to secure crucial rebounds contributed to their downfall, particularly highlighted by giving up an offensive board in the final minutes when the game was tied.\nState of Play- WKU has now won five consecutive games, showcasing their strong performance in conference play.\n- UTEP continues to struggle, holding a record of 2-6 in CUSA, highlighting the challenges they're facing this season.\nUTEP will face Middle Tennessee on February 1 and then host rival NM State on February 8 for a key matchup in the Battle of I-10.\nBottom LineTo improve their chances in upcoming games, UTEP must address rebounding deficiencies and enhance shooting performances, especially from beyond the arc, to overcome competitive teams.\nRead more at UTEP Miners\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
