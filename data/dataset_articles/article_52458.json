PHOTO: KANPAI GROUP Teo Kai Xiang UPDATED Jan 31, 2025, 03:00 PM Thanks for sharing! SINGAPORE – Drinkers of a previous era might recall nights along the bridges of Clarke Quay, where young adults would gather to play drinking games while downing cheap booze – the first stop of their night before a visit to Singapore’s long-running nightclub, Zouk .Today, those bridges are quiet, and the nightlife landscape for Gen Zers and younger millennials is markedly different.For Mr Nicolas Tang, a 23-year-old student at Singapore Management University, coming of age during the Covid-19 pandemic meant an experience very different from that of his seniors. “I think Covid-19 killed the habit of seniors taking their freshmen and juniors out to bars and clubs,” he says.Affordability is also an issue. Mr Tang estimates having to spend more than $50 to get home if he stays out past midnight, after the last train has left.",
