  "text": "31st January 2025 – 9Hong Kong) James Shing, a former senior executive at Asia Television, and his wife, socialite Michelle Chua, have become the talk of the town with their exuberant Chinese New Year decorations. The couple, who tied the knot in 2014 and share twin children, reside in a sprawling 7,000-square-foot standalone home in Stanley. Known for her attention to festive details, Chua has taken seasonal decor to new heights, transforming her home into a spectacle of colour and symbolism.\nSharing photos on social media, Chua revealed a living room bursting with oversized floral arrangements, golden ingots meticulously placed on shelves, and vibrant ornaments scattered throughout. Even the driveway wasn’t spared, festooned with a sea of red lanterns to amplify the holiday cheer. The centrepiece of the decor—a colossal floral installation in the living room—stood as a bold testament to her commitment to creating an auspicious atmosphere.\nIn addition to the elaborate decor, Chua prepared a feast of traditional New Year dishes for her family and showed off her festive manicure, ensuring every detail aligned with the celebratory spirit. She capped off her efforts by sharing a polished family portrait online, further cementing her reputation for embracing holiday traditions with flair.\nWhile the display has drawn admiration from some, others have described it as overindulgent, with its sheer scale bordering on garish.",
