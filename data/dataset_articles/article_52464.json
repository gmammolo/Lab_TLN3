  "text": "Evan Ferguson on dry loan smart? Clearlake bitten off more than they can chew, time to hand over to Boehly? Big respect to Chilwell after being treated badly, Silva, Eghbali, & being Chelsea, More...\nThe Chelsea FC Newsletter: Friday 31st January 2025\nMorning all!\nFriday again already, that week flew by! They told us it was going to be ‘very busy’ for Chelsea in the market, but the fact remains we have not yet done a single permanent transfer deal outgoing or incoming. Still time left I guess…\nAnyways, round up all your very latest transfer news from across the last 24 hours in the same place in here. This will cover all the very latest transfer stories involving Chelsea. This has all the latest on Mathys Tel and anything else going on (not much in fact). I still feel a shock coming from nowhere, we simply have to get a striker in. Maybe a Benjamin Sesko comes from nowhere, or we drop the bag for Liam Delap. I’d be happy with either.\nWe also had our latest Podcast out last night to speak about any late transfer moves we can expect to see. You can listen to that here.\nEvan Ferguson on a loan deal might be one last minute option that Chelsea could turn to. Is that something you would go for? I would take it on a dry loan with an option, and I explain why here. It’s still an option for Chelsea, let’s see if they try it.\nThe Score jumped back on yesterday and he is once again spitting facts in his latest article here. Chelsea doesn’t feel like Chelsea these days, and he’s explained it so well in his latest titled ‘Thiago Silva, Behdad Eghbali, & being Chelsea.’\nHave Clearlake bitten off more than they can chew? One community member on here believes they have and has a feeling they might sell up to Todd Boehly. But we believe that might be more hopeful than anything else right now. The quotes in this here are an absolute MUST READ, this is all completely spot on.\nFinally, it’s been reported that Ben Chilwell might have to stay at Chelsea and rot some more. I want to say massive respect to Chilly for being so professional through all of this, even though he’s been yet another player treated like crap by this lot. I do hope he still finds a move, but it’s looking like a hard task now. My words on Chilly and how he has been treated in here.\nRight, I’ll jump on the Substack App this weekend if I get any info given to me or if any big stories go out. If not, I’ll be back on the site on Sunday so see you all then.\nHave a great weekend!\nSimon Phillips",
