  "text": "ASHLAND − The atmosphere and vibe on Thursday night at home was all set up for the Ashland Arrows to wrap up the Ohio Cardinal Conference title, but the celebration will have to stay on hold for at least another game. In a matchup between the top two squads in the OCC that was plenty scrappy and hard-fought, New Philadelphia clawed its way to an 45-43 overtime win over Ashland, to split the season series.After the first quarter, Ashland (13-4, 9-1) was in plenty control with a 16-7 lead, but toward the end of the second quarter, New Philadelphia (12-6, 8-3) found some life and carried that into the start of the third quarter where they made a 9-0 run to cut the game to 21-19. For the rest of the third quarter, the Quakers grabbed the momentum and from there on, it was a scrap fest of a game.\nMore: Ashland County Girls Basketball Power Rankings: Loudonville notch big conference win \"They were capitalizing on our turnovers, and we had a couple hiccups on defense,\" said Ashland head coach Renee Holt, describing the third quarter where her team got outscored 12-6. \"They passed it over the top of our defense, and they made us work on defense.\"\nA noticeable theme in this one was the many fouls that were called, with bodies from both sides hitting the floors often. Two of the Arrows' starters in Lauren Green and Cienna Steury fouled out late in the game.\"I found out the fouls were 8 to 2 at halftime,\" Holt said. \"We fouled out two of our starters. It sucks but that's the style of play we play. We're up in your face and physical. We just have to adjust and be physical.\"The fourth quarter featured a couple of lead changes with key shots being made by Ashland's Madison Hoffman (17 points, five 3-pointers made) and Kennedy Lacey (10 points).\nWith New Philadelphia up 37-35, Ashland post player Camryn Cox (8 points) drew a foul and made two crucial free throws in the closing seconds of the fourth quarter to tie the game up heading into overtime.\nIn the overtime period, Ashland got a 41-37 lead and looked poised for victory. That is until the Quakers surged back with 6-0 run off a couple of drives to the basket. Even at 43-43 and four seconds left, two key free throws were made by New Philadelphia's Aubrie Wells that clinched the game for the Quakers.A key turning point Holt looked at, was that 6-0 overtime run by New Philadelphia.\"It was some breakdowns defensively, and they capitalized,\" she saidStill, with a 1.5 game lead over New Philadelphia and two league games remaining, the OCC title is still Ashland's for the taking. They will look to clinch it on Saturday versus Madison Comprehensive, who they defeated by 18 points in early January.\"We talked in the locker room,\" said Holt. \"What a cool opportunity for this program. It hasn't seen a crowd like that for I don't even know how long. I told them to soak it up and don't hold your heads. The cool thing is we can still hold those numbers on the banner.\" jsimpson@gannett.com Twitter/X:@JamesSimpsonII",
