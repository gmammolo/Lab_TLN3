  "text": "Now Playing Share Share Video Link copied! Samsonov stopped 22 of 24 shots in Thursday's 2-1 overtime loss to the Blue Jackets.\nSamsonov played well, but the Golden Knights ' offense didn't give him enough help. The 27-year-old netminder has allowed two or fewer goals in nine of his last 11 games, going 7-3-1 in that span. He's still playing second fiddle to Adin Hill, who recently started three games in a row versus teams firmly in the playoff picture. Samsonov is 12-6-2 with a 2.74 GAA and an .899 save percentage over 20 starts this season. The Golden Knights will be on the road leading into the 4 Nations Face-Off, and the trip begins on Broadway when they visit the Rangers on Sunday.\nMore News Golden Knights' Ilya Samsonov: Expected to start Thursday 13H ago • by RotoWire Staff Golden Knights' Ilya Samsonov: Back in win column Thursday 7D ago • by RotoWire Staff Golden Knights' Ilya Samsonov: Between pipes against St. Louis 8D ago • by RotoWire Staff Golden Knights' Ilya Samsonov: Gives up five goals Saturday 12D ago • by RotoWire Staff Golden Knights' Ilya Samsonov: In goal against Chicago 12D ago • by RotoWire Staff Golden Knights' Ilya Samsonov: Takes second consecutive loss 16D ago • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Hockey Stories Fantasy hockey rankings, picks, 2024-25 simulation CBS Sports Staff • 3 min read 2024-25 Position Battles Janet Eagleson • 6 min read Draft busts for 2024-25 Corey Abbott • 5 min read Draft breakouts for 2024-25 Ryan Dadoun • 8 min read Draft sleepers for 2024-25 Corey Abbott • 6 min read 2024-25 goalie tiers Jon Litterine • 5 min read",
