  "text": "THE WHAT? Kiehl’s has launched a campaign to promote its intimate care line that is aptly describing as bold. The L’Oreal-owned brand has created a first-of-its-kind font, named Pubic Display Type, crafted entirely from human public hair, which it has used on posters.\nTHE DETAILS The move follows a previous campaign featuring models with visible pubic hair which was censored in select stores. Kiehl’s says it turned this challenge into an ‘opportunity’ and that the visuals, shared across the brand’s digital platforms, bring attention to the importance of embracing diversity and destigmatizing conversations about our bodies.\nTHE WHY? Kiehl’s Global Brand President Jon Sáenz, explains, “As trusted skincare experts since 1851, Kiehl’s understands that all skin deserves respect and care, including our intimate areas. Our response to the censorship of our Kiehl’s Personals imagery underscores our commitment to honest conversations about body hair, and our private parts, and challenging outdated societal taboos. Pubic hair is a natural part of the human body, and there is no reason to feel uncomfortable with it. We believe in providing solutions for all skincare needs, without exception.”",
