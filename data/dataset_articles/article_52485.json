  "text": "Saint Mary’s Gaels Fall Short to Portland 58-66 Despite Rally\nSaint Mary's women's basketball team exhibited remarkable resolve by rallying from a 14-point deficit against Portland but ultimately fell short, losing 66-58. The Gaels managed to tie the game late in the fourth quarter, thanks to a strong second half bolstered by Emily Foy's sharp shooting, but were unable to convert key opportunities down the stretch. Despite their defensive prowess and an inside scoring advantage, their inconsistent offense in the final minutes led to the loss, marking their fourth defeat in conference play.\n- Saint Mary's scored 24 points in the paint compared to Portland's 9.\n- Emily Foy led the Gaels with 13 points, while Maia Jones added 11 points.\nDespite a valiant effort, the Gaels struggled offensively in critical moments, going just 1-of-11 during the final 5:30 of the game. Their strong defensive performance held Portland to only 39% shooting overall, yet their inability to capitalize on offensive opportunities undermined their efforts.\nState of Play- Saint Mary's defense forced 16 turnovers from Portland.\n- The Gaels currently hold a 7-4 record in the West Coast Conference, placing them fourth in the standings.\nLooking ahead, Saint Mary's will continue their road trip in the Pacific Northwest, facing Oregon State on Saturday. This matchup presents an opportunity for the Gaels to rebound and improve their standing in conference play.\nBottom LineSaint Mary's displayed commendable tenacity but must enhance their offensive efficiency in clutch situations to secure future wins. The team's ability to capitalize on defensive stops could determine their trajectory going forward in the season.\nRead more at SMC California Athletics\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
