  "text": "Chandimal’s Defiant 63 Keeps Sri Lanka Afloat as Australia Strikes\nSri Lanka faces a challenging uphill battle against Australia after lunch on day three, with the score at 136 for 5, trailing by 518 runs from Australia’s first-innings declaration of 654 for 6. Dinesh Chandimal stands out with an impressive 63 not out, while rain interrupted play, leaving Sri Lanka needing substantial partnerships to avoid the follow-on. Australia's bowlers, especially Mitchell Starc and Matthew Kuhnemann, have looked threatening on a deteriorating pitch that has begun to crack and change, adding pressure to a struggling Sri Lankan side.\nBy the Numbers- Sri Lanka: 136 for 5 at lunch\n- Dinesh Chandimal: 63 runs off 91 balls\n- Australia's first innings: 654 for 6 declared\n- Mitchell Starc: 2 wickets for 13 runs\n- Matthew Kuhnemann: 2 wickets for 48 runs\n- Dinesh Chandimal remains unbeaten but is without strong support.\n- Two Australian bowlers have claimed multiple wickets, adding to Sri Lanka’s troubles.\n- The pitch is showing clear signs of wear, complicating batting efforts.\nFor Sri Lanka to avoid the follow-on, they must rally a significant partnership, especially from Chandimal. If their tail fails to support him, they face a likely innings defeat. Australia's bowlers will continue to exploit the pitch conditions, looking to wrap up the Sri Lankan innings swiftly.\nBottom LineChandimal's performance is vital for Sri Lanka, but without consistent partnerships, the team's chances of standing against Australia dwindle. The match appeals to a narrative of resilience versus dominance, with the pitch conditions likely favoring the bowlers going forward.\nRead more at ESPNcricinfo\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
