  "text": "Waves Narrowly Fall to Beavers 54-63 in Corvallis Update\nThe Pepperdine women's basketball team narrowly fell to Oregon State, 54-63, in a tightly contested match at Gill Coliseum. Despite the loss, the Waves kept the game competitive, highlighted by key three-point shots and capitalizing on turnovers, but struggled in the fourth quarter as Oregon State's defense stifled their scoring. Senior Ornela Muca led Pepperdine with 15 points, while Malia Mastora contributed 12 points.\n- Pepperdine outshot Oregon State in three-pointers at .375 to .286.\n- The Waves scored 19 points off 14 turnovers by the Beavers.\n- Oregon State out-rebounded Pepperdine 44 to 28.\n- Pepperdine posted substantial scoring from beyond the arc, making six three-pointers in the game.\n- After a tough first half, the Waves showed improved performance in the third quarter, shooting 46.2% overall.\nNext, Pepperdine will face the Portland Pilots on Saturday night at the Chiles Center, with tip-off scheduled for 5 p.m. The Waves will look to rebound from this narrow defeat in hopes of improving their conference record.\nBottom LineDespite a hard-fought game and solid individual performances, the Waves need to improve their fourth-quarter execution and rebounding if they hope to achieve success in upcoming matchups.\nRead more at Pepperdine University Athletics\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
