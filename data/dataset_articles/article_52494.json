  "text": "\"We are proud of you.\" The last words of figure skaters Naumov and Shishkova – they seemed to say goodbye to their son\nThe plane crash in Washington claimed the lives of our compatriots, Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova. The last words of famous figure skaters in their social networks were addressed to their son. Now it feels like they've said goodbye to him. Parents shared their pride for Maxim, who successfully skated the program at competitions in Kansas. \"We are proud of you,\" Naumov and Shishkova wrote.\nRecall that on the night of January 29-30, a passenger plane and a military helicopter collided in the sky near Reagan Airport in Washington. After that, both ships crashed into the Potomac River.\nThere were more than 60 people on board the civilian aircraft. Among them are athletes returning from the figure skating championships in Kansas. As well as coaches Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, world champions in pair skating. They left for America back in 1994.\nVadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova. PHOTO: IMAGO/www.imago-images.de/Globallookpress\nThe skaters had high hopes for Maxim's son. He also followed in his parents' footsteps, professionally engaged in figure skating since childhood.\nMaxim Naumov took the fourth place at the championship in Kansas. For this, a tin medal is awarded in the USA, and such a prize-winner also stands on a pedestal. The parents of the 23-year-old figure skater left identical messages on their social media pages.\nWe are proud of you, Maxim. He reached the podium at the National Competitions after finishing seventh in the short program.,\n- my father and mother wrote.\nMaxim Naumov. PHOTO: Screenshot of a social media post\nShishkova and Naumov called their son's performance beautiful and emotional. They added that champions from four continents took part in the competition.\nThis post now looks like a farewell to Maxim. Less than a day later, Naumov and Shishkova boarded the fatal flight. Initially, there were reports that Maxim was on the same plane. But then it turned out he was on another flight.\n\"I feel sorry for people. Humanly speaking. But why are they now so persistently associated with Russia? They have been citizens of another country for a long time.\",\n\"I express my condolences to the relatives and friends of those who died in the plane crash. But the day before, a mother and a two-year-old baby were killed in the Belgorod region during shelling, which of the world's media described this tragedy as this plane crash??? Nobody. Why? Because their deaths are a tragedy, and our deaths are statistics.\",\n\"They left for a better life. They became US citizens. They didn't train our athletes. Their son defended the title of his country (not Russia). Of course, it's a pity that they died. But this is a tragedy for the United States and its citizens. We have our own troubles and losses!\",\n\"People, what are you! When people die, it's always a tragedy! Especially the young ones, who should have their whole lives ahead of them! Condolences to the family and friends!\",\n- meanwhile, netizens are writing.",
