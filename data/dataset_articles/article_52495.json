  "text": "Linda I. Perkins\nLinda I. Perkins, 72, passed away peacefully beside her family on Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2025. She was born on May 12, 1952.\nLinda loved her years at home caring for her children that cascaded into becoming a grandmother. Nothing made her cup overflow quite like family picnics and holidays.\nAbove all, though, Linda maintained deep adoration for her husband, Glen. Together, they even raised chickens as pets and enjoyed dozens of eggs as the fruits of their labor. Baking was Linda’s claim to fame. She was forever trying new recipes to surprise her family.\nAlthough a bit spunky, her compassionate, caring, and loving characteristic will never be forgotten. As weather allowed, Linda cherished gardening and had a year-round affinity for fresh flowers and indoor plants. She loved her daughter’s dogs and loved her French poodle Boots who passed on years before her.\nLinda’s heart will be remembered by her husband Glen H. Perkins; her daughter Kimberly (Michael) D’Amore-DePane; her grandchildren Kristina N. D’Amore and Matthew T. D’Amore; and her brothers-in-law Gary Perkins, and Ray Perkins.\nLinda was preceded in death by her grandparents Ada I. and Carl L. Johnson; her son Len P. Perkins; her brother Carl A. Nichols; her brother-in-law Larry Perkins; her sister-in-law Jeanette Perkins; her mother-in-law Josephine Perkins, and father-in-law Mervin Perkins.\nA private family service will be held at the family’s discretion.\nTo leave words of condolence, please visit lindfuneralhome.com.",
