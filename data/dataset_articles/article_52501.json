  "text": "Auto News\nYamaha R3 and MT03 Prices Slashed By Rs 1.10 Lakh: Updated Models Inbound\nYamaha has slashed the pricing of the R3 and the MT-03 by up to Rs 1.10 lakh. This might be due to the new model being right around the corner. Here is what you need to know.\nIn a surprising turn of events Yamaha has slashed the prices of their flagship motorcycles currently for sale in the Indian market. The R3 and the MT-03 get a price cut of up to Rs 1.10 lakh and prices now start from Rs 3,49,900 (ex-showroom) for the MT-03 and Rs 3,59,900 (ex-showroom) for the R3.\nThere are no changes to the motorcycles mechanically, but the price change is a welcome change. Yamaha says that the price revision has been done in lieu of customer demand and to cater to the growing demand of premium motorcycles but we believe that Yamaha has slashed the prices of these motorcycles to get rid of the existing inventory since a new one is right around the corner.\nThe R3 is the super sport while the MT-03 is the naked version of the same. Both feature a 321cc parallel twin engine which produces 41.4 bhp and 29.5 Nm of torque and is paired to a 6-speed gearbox with a slip-assist clutch. Both get features like USD forks, dual channel ABS, traction control, and a TFT LCD screen with Bluetooth connectivity. The R3 is available in two colours-Icon Blue and Yamaha Black and the MT-03 will come in Midnight Cyan and Midnight Black.\nThe R3 has been quite a popular motorcycle aboard with an extensive aftermarket support as well. It has for long been a great platform within the enthusiast community but the R3 has always been on a little expensive side of the spectrum when compared to its rivals.\nThe New Yamaha R3\nYamaha already has a new updated version of the R3 in international markets and they have recently filed a patent for the same in the Indian market as well. We can expect the new motorcycle to come to the Indian market sometime in the middle of 2025. It gets an all new design and some new features as well like a new LCD screen with cleaner more modern graphics. It will still have the same loved 321cc engine.\nClick for more latest Auto news.
