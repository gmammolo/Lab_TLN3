(Jerry McBride/Durango Herald) Jerry McBride × Livia Knapp of Fort Lewis College drives to the basket while playing Regis University on Saturday at FLC. (Jerry McBride/Durango Herald) Jerry McBride The Fort Lewis College women’s basketball team lost 81-76 to Colorado School of Mines on Thursday night despite a stellar 30-point performance from senior guard Livia Knapp. She played like a Division I talent.\nKnapp struggled with turnovers and shot selection earlier in the season. Not against the Orediggers Thursday night. She found driving lanes and converted at the cup; she was decisive when she shot the ball and when she passed; Knapp had six assists to two turnovers.\nHowever, despite Knapp’s terrific performance and freshman guard Katie Lamb playing the Robin role very well, the Skyhawks had too many turnovers and CSM capitalized off FLC’s 22 turnovers.\n“We praised them for their resiliency and they played their butts off,” FLC head coach Lauren Zuniga said about her team. “We did a lot of really great things and hit a lot of our goals... and we talked about turnovers. That’s an area that will kill you and we had 22 turnovers, unfortunately. Whether they're a late-game turnover or an early-game turnover, those are possessions you can't get back.”\nFLC fell to 5-14 overall and 2-9 in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference after it shot 53% from the field, 48% from 3-point range and 80% from the free-throw line. It was the highest percentage FLC has shot from the field and 3-point range in a Division II game this season. FLC has lost five consecutive games.\nKnapp finished with 30 points on 13-20 shooting from the field, 3-5 from 3-point range and 1-2 from the free-throw line. Lamb finished with 20 points on 7-11 from the field, 4-7 from 3-point range and 2-2 from the free-throw line. Senior forward Darla Hernandez had 12 points and 11 rebounds.\nCSM improved to 8-11 overall and 6-5 in the RMAC after it shot 45% from the field, 41% from 3-point range and 76% from the free-throw line.\nJenna Siebert led the Orediggers with 28 points on 9-18 shooting from the field, 3-6 from 3-point rage and 7-10 from the free-throw line. Emma Sixta had 15 points for CSM.\nFormer FLC head coach Taylor Harris was on the sidelines as an assistant coach for CSM. Harris coached FLC from 2021-2024.\nThe Skyhawks began the game well with a 21-14 lead after the first quarter. Hernandez scored seven of FLC’s first 10 points and was decisive with a quick spin move or a midrange jumper. Sophomore guard Trista Hoobler scored five consecutive points toward the end of the quarter as FLC increased its lead.\n“We were making our shots and we've done a better job of getting downhill and getting to the paint,” Zuniga said. “Our defense, too, was good, and we made them take some contested shots; we didn’t give up a million second-chance opportunities. That was a great start for us.”\nFLC’s second quarter wasn’t as proficient and the Skyhawks only scored nine points as the game went into halftime tied 30-30. FLC shot 27% from the field in the second.\nThe Skyhawks started out the second half strong and led 41-34 after a 3-pointer by Hernandez with 7:14 left in the third. After that, neither team could get much breathing room and a Knapp 3-pointer gave FLC a 51-49 lead after three.\nIn the fourth, Knapp and Lamb carried the Skyhawks’ offense with clutch shot-making. They combined for 18 of FLC’s 21 fourth-quarter points. Knapp couldn’t be stopped going to the rim with 24 seconds left; she tied the game at 72 and it went into overtime.\nFouls and turnovers plagued the Skyhawks in overtime. Seven of CSM’s nine points in overtime came from the free-throw line. Knapp was called for a carrying violation with FLC trailed 76-74 with 2:17 left; Hoobler traveled with 13 seconds left with FLC down 78-76 and freshman guard Claudia Palacio Gámez had a very poor kick out pass that was intercepted with FLC down 79-76 with three seconds left to seal the game.\n“Fatigue is a big factor,” Zuniga said. “Those late turnovers seem so glaring to a fan or anybody else, but at the end of the day, you have 22 of those. So you don't even put yourselves in those situations if you don't do it in the first quarter. So (the turnovers) are definitely glaring and all that. But I don't think that's the sole reason; it's a combination of a bunch of things.”\nFLC plays at MSU Denver on Saturday at 1 p.m.\nbkelly@durangoherald.com\nCopy article link\nRelated Stories You might also like Colorado School of Mines uses strong second half to beat Skyhawks 82-79 Jan 30, 2025 Skyhawks softball looks to return to RMAC tournament in Adair’s second year Jan 30, 2025 Here’s a look at Fort Lewis basketball teams’ postseason prospects Jan 30, 2025",
