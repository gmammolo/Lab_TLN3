  "text": "Wade Dotson passed away peacefully on January 28, 2025 at Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown, WV, surrounded by his children. Born on July 31, 1946, he was the son of Sanford and Edna Dotson who preceded him in death along with his sister, Tonya Dotson Stephens who passed away in 2016. He was also preceded in death by his loving wife of nearly 40 years, Nancy Martin Dotson, who passed away on November 15, 2024. Wade lived for 17 years in Smithfield, WV in Wetzel County. He attended Grade School and Junior High in Smithfield and graduated from Valley High School in Pine Grove in 1964. After graduation he worked for Weirton Steel Corporation. Shortly thereafter, he enrolled in Salem College where he graduated in 1968 with a degree in Speech, English, and History. He also attended Lipscomb College in Nashville, TN. In addition to his career, he also taught at Salem College for 8 semesters as an Adjunct Professor of Speech. While in college, he worked at WPDX Radio in Clarksburg as an announcer and continuity writer and continued in that position after graduation. He later joined the staff of WDTV Channel 5 as a News Anchor and News Director. During his broadcasting career, he interviewed such personalities as Francis Ford Coppola, director of \"The Godfather\"; actors David Nelson, James Caan, and numerous country music stars such as Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, Kris Kristofferson and emceed country music shows in the North Central WV area. The most significant accomplishment of his broadcasting career was covering the 1968 Farmington Mine Disaster exclusively for the Mutual Broadcasting System delivering 26 news stories that were broadcast over 500 stations throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Guam. He also had stories used on CBS and NBC. Wade was also the track announcer for several years at Morgantown Speedway, I-79 Raceway, and Elkins Motor Speedway. From the early 1970's until 1993, Wade was Vice President and part owner at Chamberlain & Flowers, Inc., an insurance agency located in Clarksburg, Morgantown, and Buckhannon. In 1993 he formed his own agency, Wade Dotson & Associates with the primary office located in Pittsburgh, PA until May 2010. At that time, he moved his business to the Bridgeport/Clarksburg area. He marketed products for Banks and Auto Dealers providing them with unique specialty insurance programs. His marketplace was WV, DE, KY, PA, NC, OH, MD, VA, and Florida. Wade was a musical enthusiast who also owned and operated Dotson Motorcoach with his son Jason for many years leasing tour buses to artists such as Dixie Chicks, Tim McGraw and Beyonce, to name a few. Wade was past president of the Clarksburg Association of Life Underwriters and the Bridgeport Kiwanis Club. He was also a member of the Bridgeport United Methodist Church. He was married to the former Barbara Blankenship Dotson, who passed away in 1986. Wade leaves behind his 5 children and 11 grandchildren; son, Jason Dotson (Paula) who reside in New Smyrna, Florida, son, Jeremy who resides in Daytona Beach, FL with 4 sons (Ethan, Jackson, Jase, and Elijah) and daughter, Abigail, son, Joshua, who lives on a sailboat in St. Augustine, Fl with his dog, Lady, daughter, Lindsay Sandy (Chad) who reside in Charlotte, NC with their daughter, Gracelynn, and son, Hunter, and daughter, Meredith (Mara) Burge who reside in Quiet Dell, WV, with their daughters, Madyson, Savannah, and Kate, and son, Carter. Wade was an avid skier and boating enthusiast. The family boated at Tygart Lake, Annapolis MD, and Florida. They skied most Sundays for many years at Snowshoe, Silver Creek, Canaan Valley, Timberline, Wisp, and 7 Springs. They also traveled \"out west\" visiting various locations with favorites being Aspen, Vail, and Beaver Creek. Wade and Nancy loved to travel, and their children have many fond memories of all the family adventures they shared together. The family also enjoyed spending time in Jupiter, Florida where Wade and Nancy resided part-time in addition to Bridgeport. Wade had a way of making people laugh. He could strike a conversation with anyone and could bring a smile even on the darkest of days. He will be missed deeply by so many. In lieu of flowers, Wade requested that donations be made to Bridgeport United Methodist Church, 251 Worthington Drive, Bridgeport. The family has entrusted the arrangements to the Ford Funeral Home, Allen Chapel, 215 East Main Street, Bridgeport. In accordance with Wade's wishes, cremation services will occur. Friends will be received at the Bridgeport United Methodist Church on Saturday, March 29, 2025 from 10 am until 12 Noon.
