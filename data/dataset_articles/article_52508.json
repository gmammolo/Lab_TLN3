  "text": "A young woman has pleaded guilty to harassment in the UK’s first ‘cyber-farting’ case after bombarding her boyfriend’s ex with videos of her breaking wind.\nRhiannon Evans, 25, appeared at magistrates court in Caernarfon, North Wales, and was accused of causing Deborah Prytherch ‘distress and anxiety’ by sending her ‘inappropriate’ videos of her farting.\nProsecutor Diane Williams told magistrates that in the first video, ‘she proceeds to pass gas by placing the camera on her bottom and passing the gas.’\nEvans sent three videos of her letting rip on December 22, followed by another four of the same nature over the next few days.\nEach video showed ‘Miss Evans passing wind, her face smiling at the camera,’ the court heard.\nHer tooting continued on Boxing Day and New Year’s Day, despite police getting wind of what had happened.\nIn a victim statement read to the court, Ms. Prytherch said she ‘would like to feel safe in my home.’\nEvans was later arrested at her home and admitted she had sent the videos. The prosecutor said ‘she wanted to send videos because she felt her partner was being treated unfairly.’\nMrs. Williams added: ‘It was purely malicious. She was smirking throughout, found it hilarious, but the victim didn’t.’\nThe case is believed to be the first instance of legal action against ‘cyber-farting’ in the UK.\nHarriet Gorst, defending, said: ‘There are some issues going on between Miss Evans’s partner and his ex-partner with regard to child contact.’\nShe added: ‘At the time she sent these videos, she had some drinks and sent them, understanding now this has caused the victim some distress. She sent them without malicious intent.’\nEvans was said to have mental health problems.\nThe magistrates imposed 15 rehabilitation sessions, 60 days of alcohol abstinence monitoring, and a two-year restraining order.\nEvans was ordered to pay £100 compensation and £199 costs to the victim and was banned from contacting her.\nA probation officer said she had been in a relationship for two years, and there was ‘bad blood’ with her boyfriend’s ex-partner. She hadn’t thought sending the videos was a criminal offence and the defendant questioned why she hadn’t been ‘blocked’ by the victim prior to appearing in court.\nALSO READ:",
