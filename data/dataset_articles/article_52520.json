  "text": "By Zach Ragan ,\n4 hours ago\nIt's time -- way past time, actually -- for Amazon to move on from Kirk Herbstreit as part of its NFL Thursday Night Football coverage.\n2024 was a rough year for Herbstreit. The criticism for the longtime broadcaster, much of which was self-inflicted, reached an all-time high over the last 12 months.\nDuring the college football season it felt like Herbstreit would spend most of the week walking back (or clarifying) controversial comments he made on College GameDay or during that week's primetime ABC college football game.\nBy the time Thursday Night Football rolled around, it seemed like Herbstreit was running on fumes due to his hectic travel schedule and seemingly never-ending broadcast-related responsibilities.\nHerbstreit obviously isn't leaving ESPN anytime soon. He's a staple of the network's college football coverage and whether you like him or not, he's earned the right to determine his role with the network.\nHis gig with Amazon is another story. The Herbstreit/Al Michaels pairing has felt clunky from the beginning. It probably doesn't help that Michaels, a broadcasting legend who just turned 80, has lost a step or two. Michaels is still a pro's pro, but his fastball isn't what it used to be.\nCombine Michaels' decline with Herbstreit's general lack of day-to-day knowledge of the NFL (that's not a criticism of Herbstreit -- it's impossible to follow every single thing happening in college football and the NFL on a weekly basis...there are only so many hours in the day), and it's no wonder why the Thursday Night Football broadcast feels \"amateurish\" compared to the broadcasts on CBS, Fox, NBC, and ESPN.\nAmazon, which is reportedly paying Herbstreit eight figures for the mediocre product it's receiving in return, would be best served to move on from the former Ohio State quarterback and go in a new direction.\nAnd the perfect option is right in front of them -- former Carolina Panthers tight end Greg Olsen.\nHiring Olsen would be a brilliant and perfect move for Amazon.\nOlsen was a rising star at Fox before he was demoted from the lead broadcast team in favor of Tom Brady.\nThe former Miami Hurricanes standout made it clear this week that he wants to call \"big time games\" (including a Super Bowl) again.\n“In my mind, I’m going to call big-time games again,” said Olsen to the Charlotte Observer this week. “I’m going to call Super Bowl games again. I just don’t know the timeline or the venue.”\nOlsen is under contract with Fox for two more years. And it's unclear how long Herbstreit's contract with Amazon runs. But if Amazon can find a way to make it work (and where there's a will, there's a way....we see it all the time), they should say goodbye Herbstreit and hello Olsen.\nOlsen, who spent 14 seasons in the NFL, would be an instant upgrade over Herbstreit, who never played a down in the NFL.\nHerbstreit is clearly overworked. And Olsen is obviously on the path to being a broadcasting star. But with Brady locked in with Fox for the next decade, there's no path to Olsen being the No. 1 guy.\nThis would be a win for everyone who enjoys watching the NFL (except Fox...which is why this plan may have to wait, unless a buyout can be worked out).\nMake it happen, Amazon. It's too perfect not to happen.\nRelated: Cam Newton's latest comments about Super Bowl XL have Carolina Panthers fans rightfully seething with anger",
