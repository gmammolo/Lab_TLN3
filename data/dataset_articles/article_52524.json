  "text": "The process of making bacon has recently left people surprised, to say the least, with some swearing off the breakfast staple after learning about its production. Archive footage from Discovery Channel UK's \"How It's Made\" programme, which originally aired in 2018, resurfaced on YouTube and has since caused quite a stir among viewers, many of whom have expressed their \"disgust\" upon seeing the entire cooking process.\nThe video reveals how dozens of pork bellies are placed into a large tumbler that spins to soften the meat for easier skin removal.\nThe documentary noted: \"Bacon is now processed and even pre-cooked in factories.\"\nAfter softening, the bellies are laid out on a conveyor belt, skin-side down, and passed through a slicer to separate the skin. While the skin goes off to become crackling, the meat proceeds to a \"flipping device\" that turns it over.\nFurther down the line, workers mix a brine solution to cure the pork. The programme detailed: \"Salt is poured into a tank of water and thoroughly mixed until it dissolves. Liquid smoke and flavourings are then added before the bellies pass beneath an 'injector head,' where needles inject the curing solution into the meat,\" reports the Express.\nAs the process advances, a \"comb\" is used to prepare the bellies for hanging on racks. The Discovery Channel presenters explain: \"Next, they enter a drench cabinet for a liquid smoke shower.\"\nThe process starts by enhancing the flavour and colour before the pork bellies are placed into a large oven, slow-cooked for an extensive five hours at a minimal temperature. After being suffused with taste, the meat undergoes rapid chilling in a blast freezer and then rests in a secondary cooler for two days. The documentary highlights: \"Cooling firms the meat, making it easier to slice.\"\nOnce ready, the bellies are precisely trimmed to size and carefully screened by passing through a metal detector to ensure no remnants from metal hangers contaminate the meat. The video explains further: \"After that, the bellies are wrapped and stored in a freezer until its time to slice them into bacon. Here [in the slice line], workers load the meat into chutes which rotate back and forth over a blade, slicing the bellies into bacon-shaped pieces.\"\nThe procedure culminates as the bacon continues down a conveyor belt heading into a browning microwave, where excess fat is siphoned off, later repurposed for gravy and pet food products. The cooked bacon then \"exits the microwave oven and is carefully inspected by workers, who remove any broken or subpar rashers.\"\nLastly, the bacon strips are arranged onto parchment paper by automated wheels, setting the stage for packing.\nThe revealing video has left numerous viewers stunned, with one commenter admitting: \"I have lost so much weight since I've been watching how food is made. All the things I love to eat looks down right gross to me.\"\nOne person criticised after viewing the footage: \"Oh well, bacon is off the menu for me after watching this video. I have a feeling that ham will be going the same way after seeing what is done to it! \".\nAnother added their concerns: \"Whenever I watch these videos I always think I wonder how often the nasty meat scraps get cleaned off the machines. There's a lot of nooks and crannies for meat to get lost in.\"",
