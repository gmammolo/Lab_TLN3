He praised Sawant for her resilience in facing life's challenges and expressed admiration for her bravery.\n\"Hello India and Pakistan, this is Dodi Khan. A few days ago, on social media, you saw a video of mine in which I had proposed Rakhi Sawant,\" he began his message.\nKhan's statement\nThis is why Khan originally proposed marriage to her\nKhan continued, \"I proposed her because I know her very well.
