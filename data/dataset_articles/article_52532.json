  "text": "Mizzou women’s basketball never trailed in the first half in a road match against No. 5 Texas, but the Longhorns’ second-half performance put the Tigers back in the loss column with 70-61 defeat Thursday night in Austin, Texas.\nThe Longhorns went 14-for-27 in the second half compared to Mizzou’s 12-of-33 shooting.\nThe win keeps Texas (20-2, 7-1 Southeastern Conference) undefeated at the Moody Center, as Mizzou (12-11, 1-7) remains winless on the road in the SEC.\n“This is a really tough place to play,” Missouri coach Robin Pingeton said on Tiger Network.\nIt didn’t look too tough for the Tigers at first, as Mizzou pushed ahead to a 32-21 lead off a free throw from senior forward Laniah Randle with 4:21 remaining in the first half. It didn’t take long for the Longhorns to claw back, and a 3-pointer from sophomore forward Madison Booker with 6:26 remaining in the third quarter gave Texas a 38-35 lead — its first of the game.\nBooker finished the game with 16 points, shooting 6 of 12 from the field, including one 3-pointer, and 3 for 4 from the charity stripe.\nDespite a 10-point fourth quarter from Randle, the Tigers couldn’t pull back ahead.\nThe senior forward finished with a season-high and game-high 22 points. She also grabbed four steals.\n“Defensively, she had some really good possessions for us,” Pingeton said.\nMizzou returns home to face No. 18 Tennessee at 2 p.m. Sunday at Mizzou Arena. The Volunteers lead the nation in scoring, averaging 91.9 points per game, under first-year coach Kim Caldwell.\nOriginally published on columbiamissourian.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save",
