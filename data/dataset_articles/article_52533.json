  "text": "Young and the Restless (Y&R) spoilers imply now that Jordan (Colleen Zenk) and Ian Ward (Ray Wise) have both officially met their demise, the Newman family can pick up the pieces of their lives and try to move forward.\nWhile Cole Howard (J. Eddie Peck) was out of town during all the chaos that took place, when he returns, will Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle) and Claire Newman (Hayley Erin) fill him in on “everything” that went down?\nThe Young And The Restless Spoilers – Victoria & Claire Newman Have A Secret Y&R spoilers remind fans that while Jordan purposely drank the poisoned tea, Claire’s original plan was to kill her aunt without her knowing.\nIn fact, it was a scheme she concocted and told both Victoria and Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) about. Still, Claire made it clear that both women were not to tell Cole or Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) as she believed her grandfather and father would surely try and nix the plan.\nAs the old saying goes, “All’s well that ends well”. Both Jordan and Ian are gone, and technically, Claire wasn’t behind either demise; however, in some regard, she was the reason behind her aunt’s passing as had there been no tea, Jordan may still be alive.\nY&R Spoilers – Claire Grace’s Mental Health Spirals Claire’s bound to be affected by what went down in the aftermath of all this, and both Cole and Vicky will be worried. Depending on how far Claire spirals, her parents may find themselves scrambling to get her help.\nStill, if Victoria keeps Claire’s plan to kill Jordan from Cole, which may haunt Clair, how will he feel when he finds out?\nAfter all, secrets don’t stay secret that long in GC, and he’s bound to learn the truth. Knowing Victoria allowed Claire to go through with such a horrendous act may turn Cole off completely.\nCould this secret end up shattering the Vole romance? Would Cole break up with Vicky? Would Claire’s mental health worsen?\nWhile she was once the reason her parents reunited, if they end their relationship, she may feel as if she’s the reason they broke up. She may feel as if she’s ruined her mom’s “happily ever after”.\nWill Claire’s Jordan secret be the end of Vole? Share your thoughts, below!
