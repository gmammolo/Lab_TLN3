  "text": "A lot of people come into relationships with some kind of preconceived idea about how they’ll be treated and most of the time they are disappointed. This may be rooted in the fact that relationships are transactional these days. But most times it’s an unspoken trade.\nUnrealistic expectations by both parties are a significant relationship wrecker, silently undermining connection and fostering resentment.\nThey come from a variety of sources, including idealised romantic notions from the media, societal norms, personal insecurities, and unmet needs from past experiences. These expectations, when unmet, create a profound difference between reality and fantasy, leading to disappointment, conflict, and ultimately, relationship breakdown.\nAlso Read: Let’s explore some of these unrealistic expectations and how they manifest and damage relationships:\nTypes of Unrealistic Expectations:\nThe “Perfect Partner” Myth: Media often portrays relationships as effortless and idyllic, with partners perfectly complementing each other without conflict. This creates an unrealistic expectation that a partner will fulfill all needs and desires flawlessly, leading to disappointment when the inevitable imperfections and disagreements arise.\nInstant Gratification: Some individuals expect instant connection and deep intimacy, overlooking the time and effort required to build a strong relationship. This can lead to frustration and disillusionment when the relationship doesn’t progress as quickly as anticipated.\nSexual Expectations: The expectation itself isn’t an issue but when the two of you aren’t on the same page about it, things can get complicated.\nIf you assume that you and your partner will have sex three times a week without prior communication – and they’re thinking more in the lines of once a week or, the other extreme, five times a week – one or both of you will most likely be disappointed.\nMind Reading: Expecting your partner to intuitively understand your needs and desires without verbal communication is a recipe for disaster. Healthy relationships require open and honest communication; assuming your partner should “just know” leads to misunderstandings and resentment.\nUnchanging Partner: People change over time; expecting your partner to remain static in their personality, interests, or even physical appearance is unrealistic. Relationships require adaptation and growth; clinging to an idealised image of a partner from the past leads to conflict.\nEffortless Effort: Maintaining a healthy relationship requires consistent effort from both partners. Expecting a relationship to thrive without ongoing investment in communication, compromise, and shared activities is naive.\nProblem-Free Paradise: Conflicts are inevitable in any relationship. Expecting a relationship to be devoid of disagreements or challenges is unrealistic. Healthy relationships navigate conflict constructively; avoiding conflict altogether is unhealthy.\nAlways Available: Expecting constant attention and availability from your partner is unreasonable. Individuals need personal space and time for themselves; demanding constant connection can lead to feelings of suffocation and resentment.\nFriends Of Opposite Sex: Expecting your partner not to have friends of the opposite sex is just plain delusional. It is normal for both partners to have friends of the opposite sex, what’s important is to set boundaries that will guide such relationships.\nFinancial Expectations: Unrealistic expectations about finances can create significant stress. Expecting your partner to foot your every bill is a little extreme. Disagreements about spending habits, financial goals, or contributions to household expenses will definitely lead to conflict and resentment.\nRole Expectations: Traditional gender roles or expectations about household chores, childcare, or career aspirations can create conflict if not openly discussed and agreed upon. Healthy relationships require equitable distribution of responsibilities.\nHow Unrealistic Expectations Ruin Relationships:\nDisappointment and Resentment: When expectations are unmet, disappointment inevitably follows. This can lead to resentment, as one partner feels let down by the other’s perceived failures.\nCommunication Breakdown: Unrealistic expectations often prevent open and honest communication. Instead of expressing needs directly, individuals may become passive-aggressive or withdraw, further damaging the relationship.\nIncreased Conflict: Disagreements and conflicts become more frequent and intense when expectations are unrealistic. Partners may engage in blaming, criticism, and defensiveness, escalating the conflict.\nErosion of Trust: When one partner consistently fails to meet the other’s unrealistic expectations, trust erodes. This can lead to feelings of insecurity, suspicion, and betrayal.\nLoss of Intimacy: Unrealistic expectations can create distance and prevent intimacy from flourishing. Resentment, conflict, and lack of trust make it difficult to connect on an emotional or physical level.\nRelationship Termination: Ultimately, unmet unrealistic expectations can lead to the breakdown of the relationship. Constant disappointment, conflict, and lack of trust make it difficult to sustain the relationship.\nAddressing Unrealistic Expectations:\nSelf-Reflection: Identify your own unrealistic expectations. Examine the sources of these expectations (media, past experiences, personal insecurities) and challenge their validity.\nOpen Communication: Talk openly and honestly with your partner about your expectations. Listen to their perspective and work together to find common ground.\nRealistic Goals: Set realistic goals for your relationship. Acknowledge that relationships require effort, compromise, and the ability to navigate conflict constructively.\nManage Expectations: Learn to manage your expectations by focusing on the present moment and appreciating your partner for who they are, rather than who you want them to be.\nPractice Empathy: Try to understand your partner’s perspective and empathise with their challenges. Avoid making assumptions and engage in active listening.\nSeek Professional Help: If you’re struggling to manage unrealistic expectations, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counsellor. They can provide guidance and support in navigating relationship challenges.\nCultivating Realistic Expectations:\nEmbrace Imperfection: Accept that both you and your partner are imperfect. Focus on appreciating each other’s strengths and working together to overcome challenges.\nFocus on the Present: Instead of dwelling on the past or fantasising about the future, focus on the present moment and appreciate the good things in your relationship.\nPractice Gratitude: Express gratitude for your partner and the positive aspects of your relationship. This helps shift your focus from what’s lacking to what’s present.\nCelebrate Small Victories: Acknowledge and celebrate the small victories in your relationship. This helps build a sense of accomplishment and reinforces positive feelings.\nContinuous Growth: Relationships require continuous growth and adaptation. Be willing to learn and grow together, embracing change and navigating challenges as a team.\nIn conclusion, by understanding the nature of unrealistic expectations and actively working to cultivate realistic ones, you can significantly improve the health and longevity of your relationships. Remember that healthy relationships are built on mutual respect, open communication, and a willingness to compromise and grow together.\nI would love to get feedback, questions and recommendations on the topics you would want me to shed light on.\nSubscribe to my YouTube channel: @Eve’s Desire Show, on YouTube at: @theeagleonlinenigeria.\nSend me a message on Telegram at: @tiwa_says; Whatsapp: 09161129108; and tiwalolaoke@yahoo.com.",
