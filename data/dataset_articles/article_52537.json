  "text": "By Sam Guzman ,\n3 hours ago\nEL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — UTEP men’s basketball suffered a 78-74 loss to Western Kentucky in a back and forth Conference USA game at E.A. Diddle Arena in Bowling Green, Kentucky on Thursday.\nThe game featured nine ties and 10 lead changes, with the Miners unleashing a 10-0 run to vault ahead of the Toppers by five (59-54, 10:19, 2H) midway through the second half. UTEP was still ahead (68-66) with 3:06 to play only to have WKU score the next six points, and the Miners never led again.\nWKU’s Khristian Lander and Don McHenry gave UTEP so many problems on Thursday night. Lander scored a game-high 28 points and McHenry scored 20 points in the contest. Both of them also made shots in the clutch. The duo combined to score 10 points while shooting 4-of-5 from the field in the last 2:44 of the game.\nAs a team, WKU shot 55.6% (30-of-54) from the field.\nUTEP shot 41.1% (23-of-56) from the floor and shot 34.6% (9-of-26) from three in the contest. UTEP recorded 14 steals while forcing 18 turnovers that led to 20 points.\nUTEP fell to 15-6 overall and 5-3 in Conference USA play. UTEP is tied with Liberty, MTSU, and New Mexico State for second place in the league standings after Thursday night.\nUp next, UTEP will take on Middle Tennessee at the Murphy Center on Saturday.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
