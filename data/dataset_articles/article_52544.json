  "text": "At the end of the year and the beginning of the year, I hear a lot of concerns about \"break-up.\"\n'I can't do it anymore.' 'I must have trusted too much.' 'How much have you done to him?'\nIt's not a story of a money scam. These are the words you hear around the end of people who have decided to part ways even though they have given their body and heart and love to someone. 'Yes, yes. 'It's right to break up at that point.' The people listening to the story nods. After a long time, some people start a new life with new encounters, and even if they were fully prepared as if they were about to say goodbye, 'That's what happened. There are some couples who are still stir-frying, saying, \"I guess there's nothing I can do.\"\nThere are many reasons for separation as well as the number of couples. There is a relationship of \"union that can never be separated\" even after embracing numerous reasons, and some people succeed in insulation without looking back for just one reason. Even if \"You can live with each other, Mane\", the decision on separation is their own and their responsibility.\nThe following complaints are sometimes heard from people who were raised by parents with severe discord. \"I want you to break up soon! I'm sick and tired of it.\"\"But I don't like to hear this saying the most, 'I'm holding out for you though.\"\" This is a case of making your child's clothing burst by delaying the \"responsibility of being unable to part with\" children. Objectively and soberly, these words make no sense. This is because the parties have the final authority and responsibility to meet and cut off whether they are lovers or even married.\nWhy do they have the right to meet and put off the responsibility of breaking up to a third party? What kind of psychology is it if it's a relationship out of necessity, but it's not a case of being cowardly because you can't speak? This is primarily because they did not put more effort into maintaining and continuing the relationship than they thought. I'm getting flustered because I didn't put all my energy into it as much as I said. On the contrary, those who have struggled so much to maintain a relationship that they have nothing more to write about clearly see their limitations. They also have the courage and responsibility to part ways in the end. Some people tag these people with 'He's more cold than he looks!' but it's not that he's cold, they've really done their best and they're just people who know it well themselves.\nEven after a painful breakup, we can comfort. \"You've done as much as you can! I know you did your best!\" There is the highest honor that only those who have loved without regret, and those who have run at full speed in a relationship can give themselves. It is knowledge of one's limitations and possibilities learned through love. \"Love is something you have to learn like everything else,\" Zikmund Freud said. It is difficult to avoid mistakes. First love doesn't necessarily have to be lasting love or last love. The reason we experience mistakes and failures in love is that love is not just instinct, but a relationship that requires learning and a journey.\nThe reason I'm afraid of love is because I'm afraid I'll make a mistake and get hurt. Failure to love or a breakup may lead to considerable blame and regret. But let's consider even that experience to be a process of learning love and avoid facing mistakes and shortages. These days, I'm afraid of separation and it's not easy to love the wrong relationship. You should be careful about giving a chance to someone you don't know too well. However, this year, I hope you will find a place to put your mind and practice 'doing your best'. When I look back one day, the year of struggle will be considered the most beautiful day of my life. Life is short and love has a lot to learn. No matter how difficult and scary it is, love is eventually learned in a 'relationship'.\n[Sung Yumi, psychiatrist]",
