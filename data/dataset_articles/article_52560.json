  "text": "varmabreak up? A secret post is causing a stir!\nHas actress\ntamannaahbroken up with her boyfriend Vijay Varma? Has their\nlovebeen put to an end? A post that\ntamannaahrecently posted on her\ninstastory has raised many questions. Many actors and actresses who act together in films start falling in\nloveand then get married with the consent of their parents. Some actresses have a habit of getting married many years after introducing their lovers. Nayanthara,\nrakul preet singh, Kajal, Taapsee, Ileana, etc. can be cited as examples. Among these, actress\ntamannaah, who has been in\nlovewith actor Vijay\nvarmafor a long time, has not revealed any information about her\nmarriageyet. Whenever journalists ask her when the wedding will be, she keeps on evading them by saying something. Vijay\nvarmahas also not revealed any information about her\nmarriageyet.\nAlthough the\nlove storyis one side, both of them are very busy with their acting. Vijay\nvarmahas been acting in successive films and web series in Bollywood. He started falling in\nlovewith\ntamannaahwhile he was acting in the anthology film\nlust stories2. Initially, they started dating and later turned into love. In\n[lust stories](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=LUST STORIES), they acted in a very intimate scene with\n[tamannaah](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=TAMANNAAH BHATIA)and created a sensation. Once, when reporters asked\n[tamannaah](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=TAMANNAAH BHATIA)that she had never acted in\n[romantic](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=ROMANTIC)scenes and suddenly acted in such films, she boldly said that Vijay\n[varma](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=RAM GOPAL VARMA)was my future husband, and that's why I acted in such a scene. At a time when everyone was waiting for them to get married,\n[news](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=NEWS)about them is currently going viral. That is, the\n[news](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=NEWS)that\n[tamannaah](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=TAMANNAAH BHATIA)has broken up with Vijay Varma. The reason for this is a post posted by Tamannaah. Recently,\n[netizens](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=NETIZENS)are accusing\n[tamannaah](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=TAMANNAAH BHATIA)of posting such a post to indicate a breakup. In her post,\n[tamannaah](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=TAMANNAAH BHATIA)wrote, 'There is no need to keep\n[love](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=LOVE)a secret, nor is there a need to show secret interest in the\n[people](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=POPULATION)in front of you. If you want someone to see you as beautiful, first learn to see those around you as beautiful,' she shared on her\nSeeing this, her fans are asking why\n[tamannaah](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=TAMANNAAH BHATIA)posted such a post. And is there any problem in her\n[love](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=LOVE)life? Many rumors are spreading based on speculation that since\n[tamannaah](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=TAMANNAAH BHATIA)has posted this post about someone close to her, maybe she has broken up with her boyfriend Vijay Varma.\n[tamannaah](/search/topic?searchType=search&searchTerm=TAMANNAAH BHATIA), who always puts an end to any rumor, is expected to break her silence on this matter.",
