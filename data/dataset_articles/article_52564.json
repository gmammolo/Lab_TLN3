  "text": "Excluding some 'hot people' commercial districts in Seoul, the overall rent of shopping malls fell last year. The number of empty shopping malls has also increased nationwide. Office rent rose due to increased demand in the metropolitan area.\nOn the 31st, the Korea Real Estate Agency announced the results of the '4Q 2024 Commercial Real Estate Rental Trend Survey'. The overall shopping mall rental price index fell 0.14% from the previous quarter. The rental price index is an index that represents market rent fluctuations.\nIn detail, the rental price index of collective shopping malls fell 0.2%, small shopping malls fell 0.18%, and medium and large shopping malls fell 0.11%, respectively. Compared to a year ago, commercial rent has decreased significantly. This is because the collective shopping mall rental price index fell 0.44% year-on-year, 0.5% for small stores, and 0.16% for medium and large stores, respectively.\nHowever, rents rose for Yeonmugil-gil in Seongsu-dong, Seongdong-gu, and Yongridan-gil in Hangang-ro 2-ga, Yongsan-gu. Thanks to this, rent for Seoul's collective shopping mall rose 1% year-on-year, small shopping malls rose 2%, and medium and large shopping malls rose 1.59%, respectively.\nThe Korea Real Estate Agency said, \"Seoul rose year-on-year due to an increase in floating population and sales, centering on hot-ple commercial districts such as Yongsan Station, but the provinces fell due to a slump in offline commercial districts,\" adding, \"The polarization of Seoul and local commercial districts continues.\" In addition, the vacancy rate of shopping malls nationwide is also increasing. The nationwide collective shopping mall vacancy rate was recorded at 10.1%, up 0.2 percentage points from the previous year.\nOn the other hand, the national office rental price index rose 3.22% year-on-year. This is the aftermath of the concentration of rental demand in central business districts in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province. In particular, demand for leases has increased significantly near Gangnam Station (GBD), an existing business district, and Yongsan Station, an emerging business district. Thanks to this, the Seoul office rental price index rose 4.78% year-on-year.",
