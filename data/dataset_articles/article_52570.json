  "text": "Tom Selleck spotted eating alone on 80th birthday amid obesity battle and career decline\nTHOUSAND OAKS, CALIFORNIA: Tom Selleck turned 80 on Wednesday, January 29, but instead of having a big bash for his milestone birthday, the ‘Blue Bloods’ star was reportedly seen eating alone at a McDonald's drive-thru.\nThe veteran actor was spotted eating lunch in his truck in Thousand Oaks, California, RadarOnline.com reported, citing sources.\nTom Selleck's 80th birthday lunch for one at fast food drive-thru\n— Pacific Sanctum✨THE BLESSED 😇 (@preueth)[https://t.co/K9hB3Osyh0][January 30, 2025]\nThe publication also said that his solo lunch date should not come as a shock as he previously revealed that he prefers not to make a big deal out of his birthday.\nTom Selleck Celebrates Milestone 80th Birthday With Trip to McDonald’s Drive-Thru -\n— William Dyer (@wdyerz)\n\"The photos were captured on Tuesday, January 28, one day before the TV icon celebrated his big milestone. In one picture, Tom was seen holding a bag of food that was handed to him by the person…[pic.twitter.com/zjice0jeGU][January 31, 2025]\nTom Selleck said he’s ‘stopped celebrating birthdays’\n“I’ll probably have dinner with maybe my brother and my sister and (my wife) Jillie, just go out to dinner, kind of be quiet and not make a big deal of it,\" he mentioned.\nThe ‘Friends’ actor also shared, \"I'm trying not to count. I stopped celebrating birthdays a while back. I intend to keep working.\"\nThough Selleck is still hopeful to continue doing work, he’s yet to receive an offer following the cancellation of his long-running CBS series ‘Blue Bloods’ in 2023.\nAs per a tipster, he’s even begun asking for help from his industry friends, like Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox.\nTom Selleck's lonely 80th birthday lunch for one at fast food drive-thru\n— Daily Mail Online (@MailOnline)[https://t.co/kawhyu5hQ1][pic.twitter.com/c40ZIygAL1][January 30, 2025]\nTom Selleck thinks Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox will help him get work\nThey noted, “He's desperate for work and calling in every favor he can think of. People might not realize how close he is with the Friends cast from back when the Magnum, P.I. hunk famously played a love interest of Cox's character, Monica Geller.”\n“They all loved him when he was on the show. He's hoping Jennifer and Courteney will lend him a hand,” the source added.\nThe source even went on to say that Selleck’s hopeful that his ‘Friends’ co-stars “can set him up with a gig of his liking, and maybe Jen can even get him on The Morning Show. He would love that.”\nRegarding his off time, the source stated that the ‘Three Men and a Baby’ actor is not liking it.\n“He's a workaholic, he can't retire. Tom has finally gotten it, loud and clear, that Blue Bloods is not coming back, so he's trying to get work proactively. He has lots of friends in Hollywood and he's tapping all his contacts.” they asserted.\nTom Selleck faces health risk due to increasing weight\nAnother thing which is concerning is Selleck’s increasing weight. The 6-foot-4 man reportedly weighs around 350 pounds.\nA mole said, “It's no secret Tom's been in questionable health, and he tells everyone how much he resents this early retirement that he never wanted. His thunderous weight gain must be putting terrible pressure on his joints.”\nThe Florida-based Dr Gabe Mirkin also shared his two cents over the ‘Quigley Down Under’ star’s health.\n“The odds are overwhelming that he is already diabetic, and every high rise in blood sugar after eating can damage every cell in his body,” Mirkin added.",
