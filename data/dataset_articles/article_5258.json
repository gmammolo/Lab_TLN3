  "text": "Corruption allegations\nKarnataka: Relief for Siddaramaiah as court accepts closure report in alleged land scam\nThe bench also accepted the closure report against the chief minister’s wife BM Parvathi, brother-in-law Mallikarjun Swamy and former landowner J Devaraj.\nA special court in Bengaluru on Wednesday accepted a closure report filed by the Karnataka Lokayukta police in a case against Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and three others in an alleged land scam involving the Mysuru Urban Development Authority, The Indian Express reported.\nThe Lokayukta police had filed the closure report in February, claiming that there was not enough evidence to establish corruption charges against Siddaramaiah, his wife BM Parvathi, brother-in-law Mallikarjun Swamy and former landowner J Devaraj.\nHowever, the report had been kept in abeyance to allow the Lokayukta police to complete investigations into the larger allegations of corruption, according to the newspaper.\nOn Wednesday, Special Judge Santosh Gajanan Bhat accepted the closure report against Siddaramaiah, Parvathi, Swamy and Devaraj, but clarified that the investigation against other accused persons can continue, Bar and Bench reported.\nThe judge also rejected an application by the complainant demanding that contempt of court proceedings be initiated against the investigating officer.\nThe court held that the Enforcement Directorate, which is looking into money-laundering allegations linked to the case, can intervene in the matter only to a “limited extent” as an aggrieved person, The Indian Express reported.\nThe alleged scam pertains to the allotment of 14 high-value housing sites in Mysuru’s Vijaynagar area to Parvathi in 2021 by the Mysore Urban Development Authority under a state government scheme.\nThis was allegedly done in exchange for 3.1 acres of land that Parvathi owned in another part of the city. The land was alleged to have been illegally acquired from Dalit families.\nThe Karnataka governor had approved prosecution against Siddaramaiah in September 2024. A special court had subsequently directed the Lokayukta police to file a first information report against Siddaramaiah, Parvathi, Swamy and Devaraj.\nletters@scroll.in.",
