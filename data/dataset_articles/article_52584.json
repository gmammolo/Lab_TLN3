  "text": "There was plenty of good to take away from the first loss of the season for the Falmouth-Mashpee-Barnstable-Sandwich cooperative gymnastics team on Wednesday afternoon. Going up against the coop team from West Bridgewater and Bridgewater-Raynham, the Cape Codders more than held their own as they put up the best score they’ve posted all season in a 146.05 to 142.9 defeat.\nFMBS got the better of their hosts on the balance beam, winning that apparatus by a 36.35 to 34.8 score. The Bridgewater ladies won the other three events, all in close competitions.",
