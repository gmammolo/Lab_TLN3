  "text": "With just 25.5 seconds remaining Thursday at Miami, senior forward Latasha Lattimore swatted away a potential go-ahead layup from graduate forward Cameron Williams, protecting Virginia’s 74-73 lead. With a second chance, the Hurricanes (13-8, 3-7 ACC) tried their luck in the paint with Williams once again, only to be denied by Lattimore for the second time in as many attempts.\nWilliams, however, was able to corral the rebound and kick the ball out to graduate guard Hanna Cavinder, who quickly swung it to graduate forward Natalija Marshall. From the top of the key, Marshall calmly stepped up and drilled a dagger three-point shot with 9.8 seconds to go, putting Miami ahead 76-74 — its largest lead since being up 7-2 in the first quarter.\nThe Cavaliers (12-10, 3-7 ACC) led for the majority of the game, leading by as much as 14 early in the second quarter. The star of the show all night was Lattimore, who played two seasons at Miami prior to transferring to Virginia. Lattimore, who appeared in 36 games as a Hurricane but started just six, scored a career-high 25 points to go along with seven rebounds and the two clutch blocks on Miami’s final possession.\nLattimore’s production was sorely needed in wake of an off night from sophomore guard Kymora Johnson. Virginia’s leading scorer was held in check with just nine points, failing to reach double figures for the first time since a loss to Georgia Tech last season. Johnson was not the only Cavalier to struggle shooting the ball though, as the whole backcourt of herself, junior guard Paris Clark and sophomore guard Olivia McGhee collectively shot an ugly 6-for-26.\nThe shooting woes for Virginia proved costly and they were unable to put Miami away in the early stages, as the Hurricanes slowly clawed their way back to cut the deficit to five points entering halftime. Though the Cavaliers had multiple double digits leads throughout the course of the game, it always felt Miami was within striking distance because of Virginia’s tendency to go on cold spells when unable to lean on Lattimore.\nDespite failing to truly run away with a lead, the Cavaliers held onto a 57-48 lead entering the fourth quarter. On what will go down as a shaky shooting night for Virginia, it was the defense that blew the lead and ultimately the game. The Cavaliers gave up 28 points in the quarter but were still in a position to win with just one stop on the defensive end.\nOne too many Virginia defenders chased Williams when she gathered the rebound in the corner following Lattimore’s block, creating an imbalance that left Marshall wide open for the game-winner. Had Marshall completed the ball reversal with an extra pass to senior guard Jasmyne Roberts, she would have had an even cleaner look on the left wing, as all five Virginia defenders were out of position on the right side of the court.\nVirginia had a shot to tie or take the lead, but graduate guard Haley Cavinder drew a clutch charge on freshman forward Breona Hurd — who was the only other Cavalier besides Lattimore to score in double figures.\nVirginia’s poor shooting was an issue all night, but defensive breakdowns throughout the fourth quarter proved to be the difference. This loss will sting.\nThe Cavaliers will have to quickly shake off the frustrating loss, as they are traveling from South Beach to head up north and take on Syracuse in another road test Sunday. Tip-off is at 12:00 p.m. and can be watched on ACCN.",
