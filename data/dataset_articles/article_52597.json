  "text": "Australian traveler Balin Blondes and a friend arrived in Vietnam on Jan. 24, five days before the Lunar New Year, eager to experience the country's culture and services. Blondes, in particular, was excited to try Hoi An's famous tailoring, expecting to have clothes made on the spot.\nHowever, when she reached the ancient town on Lunar New Year's Eve, she found rows of tailor shops closed. Locals informed her that most businesses had shut down for the holiday.\n\"Seeing all the tailor shops closed was disappointing,\" she said, adding that many local restaurants were also shut.\nOne of the few well-known spots still open was Phuong banh mi shop. On the first day of Tet, Jan. 29, Blondes saw long lines of mostly foreign tourists waiting for a taste of the popular Vietnamese sandwich. She waited over 15 minutes before finally getting her hands on one, considering it a memorable experience.\nTransportation also proved challenging. Unable to hail a taxi from downtown Hoi An to the outskirts, she and her travel companion had to hitch a ride. A local eventually stepped in to help.\nA quiet Hanoi during Tet\nAshir Azeem, a traveler from Pakistan, arrived in Hanoi on Jan. 28, unaware that most businesses in Vietnam shut down during Tet.\nBy 6 p.m., he found many shops already closed and had to turn to social media for help, asking friends for recommendations on activities and restaurants that remained open.\n\"My friends advised me to enjoy Hanoi's rare quiet and calm streets,\" he said.\nForeign tourists stroll through Hanoi's Old Quarter on the first day of the Lunar New Year, Jan. 29, 2025. Photo by VnExpress/Tam Anh |\nAdapting to HCMC’s Tet closures\nFrench traveler Sabrina, visiting Ho Chi Minh City for the first time, had researched Tet in Vietnam but was surprised by the extent of business closures. While ride-hailing apps remained functional, wait times stretched to 15–20 minutes.\nShe was not surprised to see the city's empty streets on the first morning of Tet and most businesses in Thao Dien, where she was staying, shut down by 7 p.m. on Lunar New Year's Eve.\nFortunately, she and her friends found a bar open all night and celebrated the New Year. A few eateries, cafes, and convenience stores along Xuan Thuy Street in Thao Dien, home to HCMC's largest expat community, remained open, making it easier to find food.\nOne of Sabrina’s most striking experiences was the lively atmosphere at temples. On the morning of the first day of Tet, she visited several Chinese temples in Ho Chi Minh City's District 5, where she was met with packed parking lots and long lines of worshippers.\nOn Lang Pagoda in District 5, HCMC, is crowded with visitors during Tet.

I feel lucky to have experienced Vietnamese traditions firsthand,\" she said.\nHer only regret was missing out on Michelin-starred restaurants, which were closed until the sixth day of the Lunar New Year (Feb. 3). By then, she would already be back in France.\nA peaceful Tet retreat in Vung Tau\nBritish tourist Adam, a frequent visitor to Vietnam, decided to experience Tet in the country for the first time this year.\nHe arrived in Ho Chi Minh City before taking a speedboat to Vung Tau, a coastal city near the southern metropolis, hoping for a quieter getaway with fewer tourists. Having researched Tet’s impact on tourism, he planned accordingly.\nAdam (L) celebrates New Year's Eve in Vung Tau on Lunar New Year's Eve, Jan. 28, 2025. Photo provided by Adam |\n\"Some street food vendors were still open, but all amusement parks were closed. I preferred this peaceful atmosphere in Vung Tau,\" he said.\nDuring his stay, he focused on trying local street food. On New Year’s Eve, he joined locals to watch fireworks. When he returns to the U.K., he plans to encourage his friends to visit Vietnam during Tet.\n\"New Year’s celebrations back home are short and lack the festive energy and depth of Vietnam’s Tet,\" he said.\nHaving visited Vietnam many times, Adam advised travelers to research Tet schedules carefully and plan transportation in advance, as many ride-hailing drivers and intercity buses take a break during the holiday.\n\"If you prepare well, you won't waste time searching for open services and can fully enjoy your trip in Vietnam,\" he said.\nDespite holiday closures, Blondes still created lasting memories in Hoi An. Her most unforgettable moment was watching fireworks from the balcony of her homestay in the heart of the town.\nOn the second day of Tet, she finally found a tailor shop open and had a pink suit made in just over half a day. That morning, she also became the first customer of the new year at a local jewelry workshop, where she crafted her own silver ring.\n\"This Tet trip to Vietnam was truly special,\" she said.",
