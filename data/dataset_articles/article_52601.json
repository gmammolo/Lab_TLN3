  "text": "Renowned Nigerian media personality, Tolu Oniru, popularly known as Toolz, has slammed legendary singer, 2Face, for taking to social media to announce separation from his wife, Annie. Speaking in a recent episode of her podcast, ‘Off Air,’ Toolz opined that the couple should have handled the divorce privately.\nThe curvy media personality stated that the timing was also wrong considering that Annie was already facing backlash over her appearance on the Young, Famous & African reality show.\nIn her words:\n“There is a lot that goes on in marriages. They [2face and Annie] have had very public ups and downs. But I just feel that this is something they could have handled privately, especially with what was going on with Annie at that point.\n“It didn’t need to come out now. People get divorced privately all the time. Everybody knows that Annie loves 2Face very much. It quite sad for a lot of people because when you think about there love journey, everybody wanted a happy-ever-after for her but life happened.\n“I feel like somebody you got married to, at some point, I imagined you loved, mother of your children, everything, when she’s going through something really public and people are attacking her, it’s not nice to just come and announced that you’re divorcing her that same period.”",
