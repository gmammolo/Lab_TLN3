And please invest in a quality brush. I recommend a mixed-bristle brush for daily use and a wet brush for detangling damp hair.\"\nExperts at cosmetics brand Garnier seconded this: \"It's tempting to start at the roots and brush downward to the tips. But this method of hair brushing is a recipe for yanking strands out of the follicle and causing breakage.\n\"You can maximise the benefits of brushing hair by working in sections and starting a few inches from the bottom. Then, move upward to the roots using short, slow strokes to detangle and smooth. This technique is much more efficient and is one way to prevent hair damage.\"If it's wet, use a microfibre towel to soak up most of the water, then air dry it before gently brushing.\nJulie swears by the Tangle Teezer and the Denman Detangler D38, however, there are plenty of great brushes out there to protect your strands against damage. Before investing in new products, it's always advisable to consult your hairstylist who can offer you tailored advice.\nThe hair expert also cautioned ladies about washing their hair incorrectly. She warned: \"Most people overwash their hair and use the wrong products when doing so.\n\"Unless you have an extremely oily scalp, washing two to three times a week is plenty.\n\"When you do wash, focus the shampoo on your scalp - not your ends. The suds running down will clean them sufficiently without stripping natural oils.\n\"If you have blonde or lighter hair, use a purple-tinted shampoo. This will help the colour pop and leave your strands looking vibrant.\"\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS\n'When you do wash, focus the shampoo on your scalp - not your ends'\nGETTY IMAGES\nFinally, Julia advised putting down the heated tools for better hair, telling women to take a break from them \"at least two days a week\".\nShe said: \"Even good quality heat tools like the Dyson Airwrap can damage your strands if used too frequently.\"\nWhen you are using heat, there are things you can do to protect your hair though. The expert advised: \"Always use a heat protection spray (like the TRESemme Care & Protect heat spray) and work with your natural texture rather than fighting it. The best-looking hair is a combination of healthy and well-styled.\"\nIn other hair news, a woman who transformed her locks in just four months shared the styling change that helped it grow fast and healthy - \"it actually works\".",
