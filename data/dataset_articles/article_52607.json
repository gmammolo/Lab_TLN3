  "text": "HUNTINGTON — Marshall's men's basketball team made a comeback to get within two points after trailing by 20, but came up short against Georgia State on Thursday, 85-81, at the Cam Henderson Center.\nThe loss snaps a three-game winning streak for the Thundering Herd (13-10, 6-4 Sun Belt) as the Panthers (8-14, 4-6) avenged a 92-79 loss to Marshall from seven days earlier.\n“Hats off to Georgia State,” Marshall coach Corny Jackson said. “They came to win a basketball game tonight, and they showed it from the tip.”\nDezayne Mingo led the Herd in scoring with 23 points. He added seven assists and four rebounds in 39 minutes of action.\nObinna Anochili-Killen had 22 points and two blocks as he crossed 1,500 career points in the loss.\nThe game high in scoring went to Georgia State’s Cesare Edwards, scoring 27 on 11-of-17 shooting.\nGeorgia State started hot, making seven of its first eight shots. It took an 11-5 lead on a three-point play from Jelani Hamilton.\nThe best point of the game for Marshall came over the course of two minutes from the 14:57 mark.\nMikal Dawson hit four 3-pointers in the stretch. Mingo added another to make it five.\nDawson’s fourth gave the Herd a 24-20 lead as he made three consecutive fast-break 3-pointers.\n“It was a good run, but we shot 30 3s in 66 shots,” Jackson said. “That’s probably too many, even though we made 12. I want to see us attack the basket a bit more and get to the line.”\nBut the Panthers couldn’t miss.\nGeorgia State had plenty of interior success against Marshall, scoring 28 points in the paint in the first half and holding a 19-11 advantage on rebounds in the frame. Meanwhile, the Herd had just six paint points in the first half.\nGeorgia State finished with 40 points in the paint.\nAnochili-Killen and Nate Martin each had two fouls in the first half. Anochili-Killen remained in the game down the stretch while the Panthers continued to score at will, making its last five shots in the first half to lead 51-37 at halftime.\n“We came out soft,” Anochili-Killen said. “Kudos to Georgia State. The bigs – I went to their house and busted them up, and they came to my house to bust me. We have to start the first five minutes the way we do the last five. We can’t have situations like that.”\nBy the end of the first half, Georgia State was shooting 71% from the field and was 5 of 10 from deep. Edwards led the way with 17 points on 8-of-11 shooting.\n“We went back to the locker room and tried to take their rhythm away,” Anochili-Killen said. “But it was too late. We have to start doing that in the first half. I’m taking responsibility for that. It starts with me.”\nMarshall had two double-digit scorers between Mingo (14) and Dawson (12), but the pace at which Georgia State scored, 1.3 points per possession, was too much to overcome.\nThe Herd got back within 10 points to begin the second half on back-to-back buckets from Anochili-Killen, but he was subbed out with 18:50 to play after picking up his third foul.\nHamilton connected on a pair of 3-pointers in response to take the Panthers lead back out to 15 at 59-44. The Herd had five turnovers in less than four minutes and went on a scoring drought of more than two minutes.\nA 3-pointer from Mingo gave him 21 points with 8:09 to play as the Herd came within single digits for the first time in the second half, 73-64, after trailing by 20.\n“We did a solid job of outscoring them in the second half, but you can’t get down 20 on your home court,” Jackson said. “They were hitting 3s, posting up and having their way all game.”\nMartin then received a pass from Mingo that he flushed for a dunk that brought the crowd back into the game, trailing 77-70 with 3:17 to go.\nAttendance was marked at 4,402.\n“We did a lot of work this week to engage the fans, and they did their job,” Jackson said. “They came out, they were loud, but we didn’t do our job.”\nAfter a pair of free throws from Georgia State, Anochili-Killen drilled a 3-pointer in transition to get the Herd within two with 15 seconds to go, but the Panthers made their free throws down the stretch for the win.\nMarshall hosts Coastal Carolina on Saturday at 4 p.m. in the second of three straight games at home.\nGeorgia State heads to Appalachian State on the same date, beginning at 1 p.m.",
