  "text": "By Lara Owen ,\n1 hours ago Don’t fall into the trap with your winter skincare regime Getty/iStock Winter’s harsh conditions – from biting winds and freezing temperatures, to blasts of central heating – can wreak havoc on our skin, leaving it dry, sensitive, and dull.\nWhile adopting a robust winter skincare routine is crucial, knowing what to avoid is equally important.\nStop slathering on thick creams, get SPF into your routine and more.\nWe asked celebrity dermatologists and skincare experts to identify the winter skincare habits to ditch for healthy, radiant skin.\nGet rid of heavy creams\nYou may think a rich cream will hydrate and nourish dry winter skin, but thicker doesn’t always mean better.\n“While a thick cream might feel luxurious, the real benefits of any cream come down to its ingredients,” explains co-founder of REFY Beauty , Jess Hunt.\n“Thick creams are often occlusive, meaning they sit on top of the skin to lock in moisture, but don’t always deliver deep hydration.”\nA cream’s consistency doesn’t equate to how moisturising it will actually be, and can often clog pores and trigger break outs.\n“Thicker moisturisers are useful in drier months, but you should ensure they’re non-comedogenic, as this prevents your pores from being blocked, which can lead to breakouts,” says Harley Street dermatologist Dr Ed Robinson .\nInstead, “look for those containing niacinamide, hyaluronic acid and ceramides to get the most out of your skincare.”\nRefy Face Sculpt REFY Face Sculpt, £38\nFacetheory hylauronic acid infused daily moisturiser Facetheory HydraOat Soothing Daily Moisturiser, £16\nDon’t banish your SPF You may think you can retire your summer SPF with consistent grey skies, but that’s a common misconception when it comes to curating winter skincare.\n“Those lovely winter walks with that bright sun may not be burning our skin with strong UVB , but the UVA is still interrupting, ageing and damaging our skin,” explains Ultrasun ‘s Abi Cleeve, founder of SkinSense .\n“Winter is when a lot of pigmentation is stimulated as our skin has not got the natural protection we build in the summer months, and can overreact to the sun’s brightness, causing pigmentation and dark patches.”\nKim Kardashian’s dermatologist says SPF is something that should never be skipped – no matter the weather.\n“Harmful UVA and UVB rays can reflect off snow and still penetrate clouds,” says Dr Simon Ourian . “I’ve seen first-hand the damage the sun can do – it’s always harder to reverse sun damage than it is to prevent it.”\nOn your face, you should opt for SPF30 or higher (and SPF50 during the summer months).\n“By using sunscreen daily, you help preserve your collagen, keeping your skin healthier and more youthful for longer,” says the STORY Clinic ‘s skin expert, Maja Swierczynska.\n“Go for a light but protective formula with pigmentation mitigators and hydrators,” says Cleeve.\nUltrasun SPF50 Ultrasun Face Anti-Pigmentation SPF50+, £32\nStop over-exfoliating When your skin feels dry or flaky, it’s tempting to exfoliate more often, particularly throughout the colder months when there’s a lesser risk of sunburn and heat sensitivity.\n“Many tend to over-exfoliate or don’t consider adjusting the strength of skincare actives through the winter months,” says Cleeve.\n“Make sure any more invasive skincare is still respectful of your skin’s natural biome – perhaps go glycolic for a while over stronger actives,” she says.\nOpting for chemical exfoliants as opposed to physical scrubs are always better for the skin. “Over-scrubbing can damage the skin’s top layer, leading to trauma that causes discolouration, acne, and irritation,” says Ourian.\nInstead, he recommends using gentle exfoliants once or twice a week.\nThe Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner, £7.70\nStop using harsh cleansers You may think that your skin is hardier throughout winter without the constant sun exposure – but it actually has a heightened sensitivity, as you fluctuate between cold, damp weather and hot, dry rooms.\n“The biggest mistake is using harsh, stripping products that damage the skin barrier,” explains cellular biochemist and SEABODY founder, Dr Helena McMahon.\n“Winter skin is already vulnerable, and these products exacerbate dryness and sensitivity.”\nUsing fewer active ingredients (such as retinol, vitamin C, BHA and AHAs) will help minimise irritation. “A streamlined approach minimises stress on your skin,” says Hunt, “which is particularly important when the colder weather leaves your skin barrier more vulnerable.”\nSkinSense Purifying Double Cleanse SkinSense Purifying Double Cleanse, £28\nSEABODY Hydrogel Mask Cleanser SEABODY Hydrogel Mask Cleanser, £44",
