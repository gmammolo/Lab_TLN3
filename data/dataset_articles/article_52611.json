  "text": "By Maira Butt ,\n1 hours ago Dancing on Ice star Chelsee Healey has revealed that she experienced a tragedy during her time on the show.\nThe 36-year-old Hollyoaks star and mother-of-two joined the programme earlier this year and was partnered with professional dancer Andy Buchanan. She suffered a fall that left her unconscious, and was the first to be eliminated from the contest after a week . In a tearful video shortly after her elimination, she had hinted: “I have had a lot to deal with”.\nAs the competition gets underway, Healey has now revealed that she suffered a miscarriage, and was left grieving during her brief experience. She thanked her loved ones, ITV and Buchanan for their support as she detailed her experience in an emotional statement.\n“I haven’t been able to talk about this until now, because it’s been too painful,” she began in a post on Instagram on Thursday (30 Jan).\n”Whilst committed to Dancing on Ice and the busy training schedule, to our shock we discovered that I was pregnant.\n“Within weeks of finding out this news, before me and my family could allow this news to sink in and digest it, I suffered a miscarriage .”\nSpeaking about the effect the experience had on her, Healey laid bare her emotions as she shared: “Understandably this really did devastate me and hit me deeply, finding out this news and then having it taken in such a short [space] of time is an awful lot to deal with.\nHealey was eliminated first and had hinted she had had personal circumstances affecting her performance (ITV) “I know I am beyond blessed to have two beautiful daughters but the grief still feels enormous. I am grieving for the little soul I carried momentarily who I’ll never get to meet, the sibling that my girls will never get to have.”\nThe Waterloo Road star, who has previously competed in the ninth series of Strictly Come Dancing too, added: “The child that will forever leave my heart curious with the ‘what ifs’. And it is painful. I thought I could just carry on but anyone who knows me, knew I wasn’t right. Some feelings you can park, put in a box and move on.\nStar shared an emotional post on Instagram (Instagram/Chelsee Healey) “This hurts differently and I can’t just move on, not yet anyway. I think that my little baby deserves to be honoured by me allowing myself to feel all the emotions, all the sadness for what will not be. There is no shame in that.”\nShe shared a message for other women going through a similar experience as she wrote: “I am truly sorry for your loss and I hope you are allowed to express and feel your emotions. Our heavenly children deserve a place in our hearts.”\nShe added: “A gentle reminder that we never know what someone else is going through or how their pain maybe hurting them.”\nBuchanan shared a supportive message under the post as he commented: “You’re a special person and I can’t express how much I respect you as a friend and a partner.\n“Knowing what you were going through, you always impressed me with how you put on a brave face and treated everyone around you with such kindness, even on you most difficult days. You’re brave for sharing this”.",
