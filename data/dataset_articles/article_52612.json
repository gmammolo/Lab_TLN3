  "text": "Reese Witherspoon has opened up about how she no longer speaks to a friend after she roasted her at an awards evening.\nThe 48-year-old revealed how an A-list celebrity actor no longer speaks to her because of the mishap, as she sat down with Will Ferrell to answer hilarious questions on flashcards provided by People as they promoted their new rom-com You're Cordially Invited.\nAdvert\nThe Legally Blonde actor asked the 57-year-old: \"You ever had this moment where you gave a speech and then you're like three years later, 'why did I do that? Why did I do that?'\"\nThe Step Brothers actor said he didn't, to which Witherspoon replied: \"Wow, you just have no regret?\"\nThe Oscar-winning actor continued: \"I have one and it haunts me, it literally haunts me. So this friend of mine who I didn't really know that well but she was a very serious proper actress and she asked me to give her an award, but I had never been to this award ceremony so I thought it was like a roast... so I got up and I roasted her.\"\nFerrell interjects and asks: \"But that was not the tone? Oh boy.\"\nAdvert\n\"The tone was British, elegant, classy... and I was like, 'do you rembember the time we got laser hair removal?', not even kidding! I'm still embarrassed about it,\" she explained, before spilling the tea further.\n\"We're not friends anymore, I'm not even kidding, we're not friends anymore.\n\"I thought it was so funny, and it was just I had the wrong audience. Yeah I'm not even kidding she doesn't talk to me anymore. Oh well.\"\nThe name of Witherspoon's former friend was never really leaked, and a deep search on YouTube of ceremonies where the Louisiana-born mom-of-three spoke at didn't uncover any answers.\nAdvert\nHowever, last year she did honor Nicole Kidman, after she won the AFI Lifetime Achievement Award. That same night, she impersonated Kidman's Australian accent, although her speech was moving.\n\"She is every bit as talented and gorgeous and sophisticated and elegant as you can possibly imagine.\n\"When you're sitting opposite her watching her work, it is literally mesmerizing. I would have to stop myself sometimes and go, 'oh my God, that's Nicole Kidman! Oh my God. Be profesh. Be profesh' - because I was that blown away.\nAdvert\nShe went on to describe her as 'one of the most brilliant business women I've ever met', and that 'she's very, very much taller than me as well'.\nSo, can we rule out Kidman?\nTopics: Celebrity, Nicole Kidman, Will Ferrell, Hollywood, Oscars",
