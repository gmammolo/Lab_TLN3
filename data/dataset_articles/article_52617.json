  "text": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Black Myth: Wukong were two games I really wanted to test with DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen. Sadly, though, there won’t be support for DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen at the launch of the RTX50 series GPUs. This information comes straight from NVIDIA.\nAs NVIDIA told us:\n“Black Myth: Wukong, Marvel Rivals, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and NARAKA: BLADEPOINT will add DLSS Multi Frame Generation soon.”\nFrom today, owners of the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 will be able to use DLSS 4 in 75 games. These 75 games are the following ones.\nInterestingly enough, NVIDIA had included Indiana Jones, Marvel Rivals and NARAKA in the list of the first games that will support DLSS 4. However, NVIDIA told us that these three games will NOT support DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen.\nWe’ve also asked NVIDIA whether you’ll be able to force/activate DLSS 4 in future games. NVIDIA said that you can enable DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen either from the NVIDIA App or from within a game (provided it gets native support for DLSS 4).\nSince I’ve tested the NVIDIA App, it’s crystal clear that NOT ALL DLSS 3 games are compatible with DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Gen. Instead, you’ll have to wait until NVIDIA whitelists it. This may take some time. Again, this is for games that only support DLSS 3. For future games that may support DLSS 4, we will most likely get Multi-Frame Gen support from the get-go.\nIt’s a bummer we won’t be able to test Black Myth: Wukong and Indiana Jones with DLSS 4. Black Myth: Wukong had support for DLSS 4 at CES 2025. So, hopefully, its DLSS 4 update will come out sooner than later. As for Indiana Jones, MachineGames stated that it will add support for it via its February Update.\nNVIDIA will launch the RTX 5090 and the RTX 5080 later today. The team stated that it might face some availability issues due to high demand. So, expect the 5080s and 5090s to go out of stock in the blink of an eye. You can also find our reviews for these GPUs here and here .\nStay tuned for more!",
