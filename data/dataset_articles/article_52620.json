  "text": "James Haskell has opened up about the real reason behind his break-up with Chloe Madeley.\nThe former couple, who announced their split back in October 2023, have maintained that they get on better as friends and co-parents to their two-year-old daughter, Bodhi.\nOpening up on the Spooning with Mark Wogan podcast, James, 39, said: \"My thing is, we split up because we didn't get on anymore, and that's it, that's the end of it.\n\"There's no like nefarious thing. Chloe, look the out of context language and the stuff the media writes, that's her use of language.\n\"Chloe is overtly honest about things like that, the honest answer is we didn't get on and that's why we separated. There's no like malicious stuff.\"\nJames went on to say that the couple's decision to split was also essential for their daughter, to give her \"the best possible life\".\nAt the time of their split, many claimed it may have been a publicity stunt as they had not long finished filming for their ITV show Chloe Madeley: A Family Affair.\nThe show gave fans an honest insight into their marriage, which included the pair being distant at times due to James' DJ commitments.\nAddressing the speculation, he clarified: \"The show was going to go out after we decided to separate, so while we were doing it, we were fine.\n\"When we were post that period of time, we were [like] listen this isn't where we can continue.\"\nHe also addressed the timing of their show's release, adding: \"Four months after that, it comes out, so the time scales are weird and it looks like a publicity stunt, people thought we were faking it.\"\nChloe, who is the daughter of television icons Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan, has been more open about the pair's split previously.\nLast year, she claimed the final year of their marriage was \"awful, dark [and] painful\", but has made it clear that she will not divulge the full details.\nIn a conversation with The Sun, she added: \"I think more people should see it as a positive thing. I'm so proud of myself and so relieved that I actually called it a day.\"",
