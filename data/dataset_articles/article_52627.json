According to a study published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, more than 60% of our mood-regulating brain chemicals are directly affected by what we eat.\nBut only 1 in 4 people consider their diet when dealing with mood issues. \"Most people blame stress or lack of sleep for their emotional fluctuations,\" said Suhail Rivera, founder of the Alkaline Herb Shop . \"But our analysis shows that seemingly healthy foods could be the hidden triggers.\"\nSuhail has listed foods and drinks you may want to avoid, adding: \" Understanding how these common foods affect mood is crucial for better mental well-being. Every person responds differently, but awareness is key.\n\"Keeping a food diary can help you spot hidden mood disruptors. This data-driven approach can help identify your personal trigger foods and create a diet that supports both physical and emotional health.\"\nFive foods and drinks that can negatively affect your mood Artificial Sweeteners: The Zero-Calorie Mood Trap\nThese synthetic sweeteners are clever mood manipulators. They mess with your gut bacteria – the tiny warriors responsible for producing 90% of your body's serotonin (your \"happy hormone\" actually comes from your gut). Regular consumption of these sweeteners can cut your beneficial gut bacteria in half, potentially leaving you feeling unexpectedly blue.\nWhole Wheat Bread: The Surprising Afternoon Slump Trigger\nWhile whole wheat bread is nutritious for many, it contains specific proteins and compounds that can trigger surprising emotional responses in sensitive individuals. \"About 1 in 15 people experience significant mood changes from whole wheat consumption, often without realizing the connection,\" explains Rivera. The effect can last up to 72 hours after eating, making it particularly difficult to identify the cause.\nCanned Tomatoes: Your Mood's Silent Enemy\nThough praised for their convenience and lycopene content, canned tomatoes harbor a hidden mood-affecting element: BPA from can linings. Tests show that acidic foods like tomatoes can cause BPA to leach at levels of 50 micrograms per liter or higher. Combined with their naturally high histamine levels, canned tomatoes can leave sensitive individuals feeling inexplicably anxious or irritable.\nOrange Juice: The Breakfast Mood Crusher\nDespite its reputation as a healthy breakfast staple, orange juice can be a surprising mood destabilizer. A typical 12-ounce serving contains 23-27 grams of sugar, leading to blood glucose spikes of 20-30% above baseline within 30 minutes. \"It's essentially setting you up for an emotional crash before lunch,\" warns Rivera.\nGranola Bars: The Stealth Mood Disruptor\nThese convenient snacks, often marketed as healthy alternatives, can be stealth mood disruptors. Behind their healthy image, many commercial granola bars are secretly loaded with various forms of sugar and inflammatory fats. “It's like giving your brain a one-two punch that can leave you feeling foggy and irritable just when you need to be at your sharpest.”, explains Rivera.\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
