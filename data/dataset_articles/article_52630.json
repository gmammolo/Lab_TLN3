  "text": "Huskers will not have traditional spring football game in 2025 Danny Jaillet Cornhuskers Wire Nebraska football will reportedly not have a traditional spring game this year, according to athletic director Troy Dannen. He made the announcement during a radio appearance on Wednesday.\nDannen did indicate that there be some sort of spring event on April 26 featuring the football team. The Red-White game has traditionally been held in April, giving the coaching staff a chance to assess the team's talent for the upcoming year.\nRising NIL deals and revenue are also factors that have been cited as factors in not having a spring game. Dannen noted that the injuries suffered during last year’s spring game stuck out to him, as reported by HuskerOnline’s Sean Callahan. He also indicated that any events that the Huskers have planned may not be televised.\n“One of my first experiences here last year, we had two ACL (knee injuries) during that game,” Dannen said. “It’s a different era from a compensation standpoint from the NIL and the investment there. The transfer portal opens up right after the spring game dates.\n“I expect something that’s not going to be televised, but something that will be a celebration of our athletes and get to see some skills and see what they got, and go from there.”\nIt will certainly be interesting to see what the program comes up with as college football enters a new era. The landscape of collegiate athletics is ever-changing, and it appears that Huskers are adapting to the times.",
