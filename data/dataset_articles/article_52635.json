  "text": "In recent times, the kitchen staples of tomatoes and onions have emerged as major culprits behind the rising food inflation in India, the Economic Survey showed Friday.While food inflation has been a global concern, India’s food inflation rate has remained steadfast for months now and a thorn on RBI's Monetary Policy. India’s retail inflation surged to a 14-month high of 6.2% in October, with food inflation reaching a 15-month high of 10.9%. However, December saw some respite from high prices as food inflation eased to 8.39 per cent in December from 9.04 per cent in November. Moreover, tomato prices were up 24 per cent at Rs 47 per kg in December, as per a CRISIL report. However, the new year might have brought some relief to India's households as common vegetables and staples such as tomato, potato, onion, rice and pulse have fallen by up to 40% in the first fortnight of 2025 sequentially.But is this relief here to stay?As per the survey, with the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) indicating that vegetables and pulses are driving inflation, the factors fueling these price hikes have been identified as adverse weather and supply chain disruptions.Also Read: Economic Survey offers hope to 'aam aadmi' on inflation pains, subject to terms and conditionsOver the fiscal year 2025 (April-December), the combined weightage of vegetables and pulses in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket was a modest 8.42 per cent, yet their contribution to overall inflation reached a staggering 32.3 per cent, the report, prepared by the Chief Economic Advisor to the Finance Ministry, showed. The exclusion of these items from the inflation metrics reveals that the average food inflation rate dropped significantly to 4.3 per cent and headline inflation would be 3.2 per cent.The report further said that the root of these price surges can be traced back to supply chain disruptions powered by extreme weather events. The India Meteorological Department has reported a marked increase in extreme weather conditions—particularly heatwaves and unseasonal rainfall—over the past few years.Also Read: Economic Survey pitches for policy shift to cut cereal output, boost pulses, edible oils Such conditions have wreaked havoc on the production of vegetables leading to inflated prices at retail outlets.Why just tomatoes and onions?Tomatoes and onions, the quintessential ingredients in Indian kitchens, have seen their prices fluctuate dramatically due to uneven monsoon patterns and supply constraints.The Economic Survey said that these vegetables are particularly vulnerable to weather fluctuations; for instance, production of tomatoes, which has a short crop cycle and limited shelf life of 1-2 weeks, is concentrated in a few states. This concentration leaves the supply chain exposed to disruptions, leading to price spikes during lean production seasons.Similarly, onions, which are mainly harvested during the Rabi season, face inflationary pressures due to lower production levels in recent years. The average shelf life of fresh onions, lasting about 2-3 months under ideal storage conditions, means that any shortfall in production can significantly impact prices in subsequent months.However, production woes are not the sole contributor to the increased burden on the 'aam aadmis'' pockets, as per the survey. Analysis of production and consumption trends over the past three years, as per the report, reveals that domestic household consumption of both tomatoes and onions falls short of production levels. According to Horticultural Statistics at Glance 2021, approximately 15 per cent of the production is allocated for bulk consumption in hotels and events like marriages. Even when considering this as an addition to household consumption, production levels still exceed domestic consumption. Therefore, it turns out that price pressures are not fundamentally due to a shortfall in production but to post-harvest losses, seasonal production, and regional dispersion in production. Also, onion exports averaged more than 6 per cent of domestic production during FY20 to FY24, said the survey report. Moreover, India's reliance on domestic production for these staples limits its ability to import during times of demand-supply imbalances, the survey highlighted. With India and China accounting for nearly half of the global onion production, potential imports from other countries are limited, as the next eight major producers contribute only around 18 per cent of global output. Also, the highly perishable nature of tomatoes restricts import options from neighbouring countries, which are not significant producers of tomatoes. Consequently, India faces challenges in importing these essential commodities, the report read.",
