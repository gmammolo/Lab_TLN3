  "text": "Kenyan content creator Milly Chebby has fired back at critics who constantly scrutinise her lifestyle.\nThe mother of one, who recently turned 38 and received a car gift from her husband, comedian Terence Creative, has urged people to mind their own business.\nMilly questions unnecessary criticism\nIn a video posted on her YouTube channel on January 31, Milly addressed some of the unnecessary comments she has been receiving from netizens. She expressed her frustration over how people feel entitled to question her personal choices.\nOne of the things that have been bothering Milly is how some people are overly concerned with her wearing shoes without socks.\nIn the video, she is seen putting on shoes and suddenly remembering how certain followers always ask why she does not wear socks.\nHowever, the biggest issue she tackled was the backlash she received after sharing a video of her decorated backyard.\nInstead of appreciating her effort, some critics questioned why she would invest in beautifying a rental house.\nWhy does my money bother you? - Milly Chebby\nResponding to the criticism, Milly expressed disbelief at how people are more concerned about her financial decisions than their own lives.\nShe stated that just because she chooses to decorate her rental home does not mean she is making a mistake.\nWhy are people so bothered by others’ lives? To the point where it irritates you? What’s your problem? I shared my backyard video, which is very simple and cute, and someone asked, ‘Is that rental?’ Are you the one paying for it? Yes, it's a rental, and I have decided to decorate it. Why does it bother you? How is it your business? Why are you upset about how I spend my money?\nMilly went on to challenge those criticising her, stating that just because someone does not believe in decorating a rented home does not mean she should follow the same mindset.\nI can choose to beautify my rental house. If you can’t, don’t impose your poverty mentality on me. Don’t do it.\nBeing a public figure doesn’t Mean you own my life\nMilly also addressed the notion that being a public figure means people have the right to dictate her life.\nShe clarified that while she shares aspects of her life on social media, that does not mean everyone is entitled to an opinion on everything she does.\nListen and listen carefully. Just because I am a public figure and I share my life here does not mean you have a say in it. It’s my life, and I decide what I want to share. The least you can do is respect that.\nShe urged people to learn that not every thought needs to be shared, especially when it is negative and unnecessary.\nIn a world where you don’t have to say anything negative, why don’t you just keep quiet? It’s not a must to have an opinion. It’s not a must. You are getting angry over things that don’t concern you. And I know you also live in a rental. Don’t advise me on how to live my life.\nSetting boundaries\nMilly’s strong response highlights the importance of setting boundaries, especially in the digital space.\nWhile social media allows people to share their lives, it does not give strangers the right to impose their views on others.",
