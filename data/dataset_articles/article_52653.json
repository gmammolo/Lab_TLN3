  "text": "F1 fans mocked as NASCAR superstar says they give off 'princess vibes'\nF1 fans mocked as NASCAR superstar says they give off 'princess vibes'\nNASCAR superstar Kyle Busch has issued a scathing assessment of Formula 1 fans, claiming that those going to the races do so to be noticed, not for the racing itself.\nF1 is no stranger to the world of luxury. As the pinnacle of motorsport racing, it attracts the biggest stars from the world of music, fashion, film and so much more.\nThe sport travels the world, racing around the globe at iconic circuits and venues; when F1 comes to town, you know about it.\nYet in the US, NASCAR is king. F1 now holds three races in the States (Austin, Miami and Las Vegas) – but the sport is not as popular.\nBusch, 39, is regarded as one of the greatest ever drivers to compete in the sport – and he believes that F1 and NASCAR are worlds apart.\nKyle Busch: F1 gives off 'princess' vibes\n“Culture,” Busch replied when asked what the biggest difference was between NASCAR and F1 on Bert Kreischer’s Something’s Burning.\n“We’re a bunch of rednecks that run in circles and they're a bunch of sophisticated engineers and smart people that turn right and turn left,\" he said.\nAs host Kreischer referenced the glitz and the glamour of the Monaco Grand Prix, Busch agreed with his take that 'most people who go aren't even fans'.\n“It's kind of like going to the Super Bowl and going to all the Super Bowl parties,\" Busch added. \"You just want to be seen.\"\n\"They [NASCAR fans] want to go to see NASCAR and and spectate it and witness it and be a part of it.\n“F1 reminds me a little bit of like the Kentucky Derby. All the girls got to wear the hats. They got to dress in the dresses you know – princess vibes.”\nTopic starts at 27:44\nF1 HEADLINES: Verstappen in transfer proposition as Hamilton tipped to LEAVE Ferrari\nRelated\nDrivers\n-\nLewis Hamilton -\nCharles Leclerc -\nLando Norris -\nOscar Piastri -\nJack Doohan -\nPierre Gasly -\nYuki Tsunoda -\nMax Verstappen -\nAlexander Albon -\nCarlos Sainz -\nAndrea Kimi Antonelli -\nGeorge Russell -\nOliver Bearman -\nEsteban Ocon -\nFernando Alonso -\nLance Stroll -\n[Gabriel Bortoleto](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-drivers/gabriel-bortoleto/) -\n[Nico Hülkenberg](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-drivers/nico-hulkenberg/) -\n[Isack Hadjar](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-drivers/isack-hadjar/) -\n[Liam Lawson](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-drivers/liam-lawson/)\nRaces\n-\n[Grand Prix of Australia 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/australian-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of China 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/chinese-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Japan 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/japanese-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Bahrain 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/bahrain-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Saudi Arabian Grand Prix 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/saudi-arabian-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Miami Grand Prix 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/miami-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Gran Premio dell'Emilia Romagna 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/gran-premio-dell'emilia-romagna-2025) -\n[Grand Prix De Monaco 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/grand-prix-de-monaco-2025) -\n[Gran Premio de España 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/gran-premio-de-espana-2025) -\n[Grand Prix du Canada 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/grand-prix-du-canada-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Austria 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/austrian-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Great Britain 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/british-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Belgium 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/belgian-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Hungary 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/hungarian-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Dutch Grand Prix 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/dutch-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Italy 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/italian-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Azerbaijan 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/azerbaijan-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Singapore 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/singapore-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of the United States 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/united-states-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Gran Premio de la Ciudad de Mexico 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/gran-premio-de-la-ciudad-de-mexico-2025) -\n[Grande Prêmio de São Paulo 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/grande-premio-de-sao-paulo-2025) -\n[Las Vegas Grand Prix 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/las-vegas-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Qatar Grand Prix 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/qatar-grand-prix-2025) -\n[Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi 2025](https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-race-calendar/abu-dhabi-grand-prix-2025)\nAbout GPFans\nGPFans is a multi-platform, multi-language brand dedicated to Formula One coverage.
