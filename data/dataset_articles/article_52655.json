  "text": "33m ago\nI took my Nest Doorbell Battery off to charge it, but the small black button on the back that stops the doorbell from being removed without using the tool is now stuck in the \"pushed in\" position meaning that it can't be re-mounted properly and is not secured on the mount. I've tried a few things but can't get the button to come out again. There’s a lot of similar threads so this seems to be a common issue. Has anyone had the same and managed to free it?",
