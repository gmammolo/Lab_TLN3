  "text": "DENVER ( KDVR ) — A night out at the movie theater costs more in Colorado than most of the country, while a neighboring state has the most affordable movie tickets in the U.S., a recent report found. CableTV.com analyzed chain movie theatre prices in each state to find out the average cost to buy movie tickets or plan a date night at the theater in 2025. According to the report by CableTV.com , movie tickets cost an average of $17.57 in Colorado, above the national average of $16.08. Colorado ranked as the No. 11 most expensive state when it comes to the cost of a movie date night. A date night at the movies would cost $45.95 in the Centennial State, above the national average of $42.66. While prices are above the national average in Colorado, a date night at the movies in Colorado is significantly cheaper than some of the most expensive states, like New York, Hawaii and Georgia, where the average movie date night would cost over $50, according to the report. Coloradans don’t have to go too far to find more affordable movie tickets. According to the report, Wyoming has the most affordable movie ticket prices of any state in the country, with an average single ticket costing $9.28 and the average movie date night costing $28.45. The next most affordable price for single movie tickets is in Arizona at $12.47 on average, and the next most affordable state for a movie date night is South Dakota with an average cost of $36.11. The report noted that most streaming platforms cost around $7 to $30 and can offer more affordable movie options for those who are happy to kick back and watch a flick with some home-popped popcorn.
