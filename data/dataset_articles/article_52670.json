  "text": "The prices of some of America's biggest music festivals are cranking up alongside the thermometer as we move toward summer. Why it matters: In an environment where food and housing costs remain high, it's harder to justify the luxury of attending events like music festivals — especially as the looming impact of tariffs threatens to further dent Americans' spending power. Between the lines: At events like Coachella and Bonnaroo, fans also have to consider the cost and hassle of camping at the event in addition to the price of entry. Fans bemoaned the prices to attend All Things Go in Maryland, saying prices were lower in previous years. What they're saying: One festival organizer says higher artist fees have led to more expensive tickets. Zoom in: Prices for Breakaway, a mostly EDM festival that travels the country, start at $69 for a one-day general admission ticket. The other side: Playing live shows isn't always financially beneficial for musicians, even as their fees increase. The bottom line: Seeing megastars perform at festivals will cost you, but there are other options.",
