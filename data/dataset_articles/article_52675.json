  "text": "Lost Soul Aside reveals a new trailer showcasing its improved graphics, though with the unfortunate news that the game is delayed until summer 2025.\nLost Soul Aside Release Clashes & Strategic Moves Although we’ve seen some great game launches in recent months across PC and consoles, we’re starting to see a familiar pattern from past years: major releases crowding around the same dates.\nRecently, it was revealed that Borderlands 4 moved its launch two weeks earlier — suggesting Take-Two may have already locked in a release month for GTA VI.\nNow, we have a similar situation to report, but this time it’s not good news. The developers behind Lost Soul Aside have announced a delay — the game will no longer release on May 30, 2025.\n“Dear fans, we are truly grateful for the positive response we’ve received from players around the world since the announcement of Lost Soul Aside ,” begins the statement from the Chinese studio.\n“We remain committed to delivering a high-quality gaming experience. To meet the standards we’ve set for ourselves at Ultizero Games, we’ll be taking some additional time to polish the game.”\nLost Soul Aside will now launch on August 29, 2025 . “We want to express our sincere gratitude to our fans who have been patiently waiting for the release,” they added.\nIs the Delay a Good or Bad Thing? The game is now scheduled to arrive on PC, Epic Games Store, Steam Deck, and PS5 three months later than originally planned . While the developers insist the delay is for extra polish, others have their own theories.\nOne popular theory is that they wanted to avoid launching on the same day as Elden Ring: Nightreign , which is understandable.\nHowever, now Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater is right behind it — Konami’s title is set to release just one day earlier , on August 28, 2025.\nThis delay might be frustrating, but it’s worth remembering that Lost Soul Aside has been in development for over seven years . First announced in March 2017, the promising hack-and-slash RPG takes inspiration from titles like Devil May Cry and Final Fantasy XV , as seen in its trailers.\nIt’s a shame the game is delayed until August, but ultimately, it may lead to an even more polished and satisfying final product.",
