  "text": "Chanel West Coast Told Cheeky Cowgirl Underwear Photos Are 'Embarrassing'\nBy Evie Scott on April 30, 2025 at 6:00 PM EDT\nChanel West Coast's popularity took a hit this week as she updated her Instagram with a Western-themed look. The TV star and rapper, 36, has been steadily posting cowgirl-themed looks as she promotes her latest \"Lil Bit Country\" single, but it didn't look like many of her fans were feeling it.\nChanel's photos marked her attendance at the Stagecoach Festival, where she showed up in a cheeky two-piece and cowboy boots, plus a hat.\nThe West Coast Hustle star, who has already had her Instagram fans questioning if she really is \"country,\" faced more of the same criticism in these snaps, although not all users were hurtful.\nChanel West Coast Sizzles In Cheeky Cowgirl Undies\nView this post on Instagram\nScroll for the photos. Offering a rear view in her opening slide, Chanel flaunted her curvy backside and toned legs in a tight pair of boy-short briefs in black.\nAdding a black halter bra top with double straps at the back, the \"No Plans\" hitmaker showed off her shapely waist and muscular back, also going full throttle with her cowgirl vibes as her bottoms came with \"YEE HAW\" written across them.\nRocking black leather cowboy boots and a tan hat, Chanel completed her figure-flaunting outfit with a hand-held shawl, posing outdoors and in the dark.\nSee More Photos Below!\nView this post on Instagram\nChanel struck a similar pose in a swipe right, once again showcasing her fit figure as she stood backed by tall palms and a lit-up sign. In a caption, she wrote: \"Yee-haw @stagecoach\" before asking fans which of the two photos they preferred. The post has now topped 16,000 likes, but the comments section is rocky.\nMocking Chanel, one fan replied: \"Yeah all the top female country stars pose like that, NOT...\" Over 15 fans agreed when a user said: \"Ya because that's country # embarrassing.\" Chanel West Coast was even targeted on the motherhood front as one fan suggested that her skimpy look wasn't appropriate for a mom. In November 2022, the L.A. native welcomed daughter Bowie Breeze with boyfriend Dom Fenison.\nStunning In Swimsuit And Cowboy Boots\nView this post on Instagram\nChanel West Coast has even been using her latest cowgirl era to promote her Coasty Swim brand, founded in 2022.\nIn the above photo, she struck a pose in a busty yellow swimsuit, flaunting her cleavage and hourglass waistline while soaking up the sun outdoors. Adding white boots and a cowboy hat, Chanel told fans that it was a \"Coasty Swim kinda day.\"\nThat Leggy Valentine's Day Dress\nView this post on Instagram\nThis share brought a more positive response. Comparing Chanel's country music to singer Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter album, one fan said: \"Your new song is amazing!!! Hell of a lot better than Beyoncés attempt at country music.\"\nChanel delighted fans with this lacy look in February, going girly in a pink minidress and strappy heels as she marked Valentine's Day. She also tagged Fashion Nova for her cute look.",
