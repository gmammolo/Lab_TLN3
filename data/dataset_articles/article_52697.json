  "text": "The Russians bought a ticket to the Egyptian Sharm el-Sheikh using the Fortuna system and ended up in a hotel with unsanitary conditions\nThe Russians bought a ticket to the Egyptian Sharm el-Sheikh using the Fortuna system and ended up in a hotel with unsanitary conditions. The details were reported to REN TV by tourist Valeria Ruzaikina.\nAccording to her, they decided to choose this type of recreation to make it easier to choose a hotel and try their luck.\n\"We were ready for a bad hotel, but we weren't ready to live in an abandoned hotel,\" Valeria said.\nShe noted that about 70% of the hotel is not occupied. Rooms are open on some floors, and there is a lot of dirt everywhere. Birds live in the hotel, and in some cases you can find their corpses, the tourist shared.\nAs Valeria clarified, there is garbage scattered around the hotel, and the hotel staff is unfriendly. She stressed that she had been poisoned while staying there.\nThe transfer to another hotel took five days. It could cost 10 thousand rubles, but, according to the guide, the tour operator made it free, the tourist added.\nAs it became known to REN TV, the press service of the tour operator contacted Valeria and informed her that the hotel, which the girl complained about, was recently added to the range, and at the first comments, cooperation with it was stopped.\nThey clarified that the sale of tours to this hotel was closed, and the staff of the receiving office began checking its condition.",
