  "text": "A few hours after Matt Rogers checked into his hotel in Dallas, he heard rhythmic grunting noises outside his door. They were coming from one of the worst hotel guests ever. “He was doing his workout in the hallway,” recalls Rogers. “It was really obnoxious.”\nRogers knows a thing or two about working out — he’s a personal trainer himself — but he says there’s a time and a place for it. The guest should have headed to the hotel gym, which was open at the time.\nBut, for heaven’s sake, keep it down in the hallway.",
