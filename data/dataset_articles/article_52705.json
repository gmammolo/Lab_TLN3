  "text": "Cracks, Peeling Paint and Damp: The Alarming Exterior Issues North East Homeowners Are Ignoring Published at April 30th 2025, 5:08 PM EDT via AB Newswire \"It’s easy to ignore what’s happening on the outside of your home — until it’s too late. This photo shows just how stark the difference can be between a protected home and one left exposed to the elements.\" — Spokesperson, WeDoRender North East homeowners are being urged to inspect their properties as small cracks, flaking paint, and damp may signal deeper structural damage. Experts at WeDoRender warn that older homes, especially in high-rainfall areas like North Yorkshire, are vulnerable to moisture ingress and energy inefficiency. Left untreated, minor issues can lead to costly repairs. Regular exterior checks and breathable render systems can help prevent long-term damage and heat loss. North East England & North Yorkshire - Homeowners across the North East and North Yorkshire are being urged to look more closely at their external walls, as growing evidence reveals that seemingly minor cracks, flaking paint and damp stains could be signs of much deeper damage. While the problem is often dismissed as cosmetic, specialists are warning that hidden exterior damage may be placing thousands of homes at long-term risk.\nNew insights from property experts WeDoRender , who operate across the region, indicate that the external weatherproofing of many homes is failing silently. And in areas regularly exposed to coastal air, rainfall, and winter frost, such as Scarborough, Whitby, Darlington, and Northumberland, these issues are often accelerated by local conditions.\nSmall Cracks, Bigger Problems\n“Many homeowners only think about their exterior when it’s time for a repaint,” says a spokesperson from WeDoRender . “But underneath that flaking paint could be a breakdown of the very layer that keeps your home dry, warm, and structurally sound.”\nRecent UK housing data supports this concern. According to the English Housing Survey: 2022 to 2023 Headline Report, more than 56% of homes in the North East were built before 1980, well before modern, breathable render systems were widely adopted. Without protective render or wall insulation, older homes are more likely to develop surface cracks, damp patches and thermal inefficiencies over time.\nTo the untrained eye, signs such as peeling paint or spider cracks may seem harmless. But the Building Research Establishment (BRE) highlights that even small cracks in render can allow rainwater to penetrate the outer walls of a building. Once water gets in, it can cause frost damage, reduce the thermal performance of walls, and in time lead to internal damp and mould growth.\nWeDoRender reports that in many North East cases, by the time visible damage appears indoors, such as bubbling plaster or musty smells, the root cause is already well developed on the outside.\nLocal Weather Adding Pressure\nThe North East and North Yorkshire experience a unique combination of challenges when it comes to property maintenance: high rainfall, salty sea air, strong coastal winds and regular freeze-thaw cycles in winter. These factors make the region especially vulnerable to exterior degradation.\nAccording to Met Office climate data, towns along the North Yorkshire coast receive over 900mm of annual rainfall, with inland areas of County Durham and Northumberland not far behind. The repeated wet-dry cycle puts pressure on exterior walls, and when combined with older construction materials, the result can be chronic water ingress.\nIn some rural and coastal villages, homes built with solid brick or stone walls, often without cavities, are especially at risk. Once moisture enters through a crack or joint, it can remain trapped, causing internal damage over months or even years.\nReal-Life Costs of Inaction\nWeDoRender shared one recent case from a semi-detached property in Stockton-on-Tees where a homeowner had ignored small cracks on the south-facing wall for two winters. When internal mould appeared behind the kitchen cabinets, a professional survey found damp penetrating through the brickwork due to a degraded painted finish. The cost of resolving the issue, including damp treatment, plaster replacement and thermal render, reached over £4,800.\n“Most of that cost could have been avoided with early intervention,” said the company’s spokesperson. “Many people underestimate what exterior render does, it’s not just for looks, it’s a line of defence.”\nCommon Warning Signs\nWeDoRender encourages homeowners in the North East and North Yorkshire to carry out regular visual inspections of their property exteriors. Key signs that suggest deeper issues include:\nHairline cracks, especially around windows, corners or door frames\nPeeling or blistered paint, typically on sun-facing or wind-exposed walls\nGreen or black staining, often caused by trapped moisture\nInternal damp patches, particularly on exterior-facing walls\nHigher heating bills, which can indicate moisture absorption affecting insulation\nImportantly, the company recommends avoiding quick fixes like overpainting or sealing cracks with non-breathable products, which can trap moisture in the wall and worsen long-term issues.\nA Regional Challenge\nFrom Middlesbrough to Morpeth, and from York to the Yorkshire Dales, WeDoRender’s assessment teams have documented a sharp increase in exterior damage requests over the last 18 months. Many are from homeowners who initially assumed they needed minor paint touch-ups, only to discover underlying issues linked to weather exposure and old render failure.\nThis reflects a broader national trend. The Energy Saving Trust states that solid walls can lose twice as much heat as cavity walls, contributing significantly to poor energy efficiency in older properties. In the North East, where energy bills are already among the highest in the UK due to colder temperatures, the connection between exterior maintenance and energy performance is becoming harder to ignore.\n“Rendering is rarely at the top of someone’s home maintenance list,” said the WeDoRender spokesperson. “But in this region, it should be.”\nProactive, Not Reactive\nThe company advocates for a proactive approach, educating homeowners before structural or financial problems develop. Rather than pushing promotional services, WeDoRender focuses on community awareness, offering guidance to homeowners, property managers and landlords on how to recognise, prevent and resolve exterior wall damage.\nThey also emphasise the importance of using breathable, weather-resistant render systems designed to work with the natural moisture movements of older buildings, especially those without cavity walls or vapour barriers.\nLooking Ahead\nWhile rendering may not be glamorous, WeDoRender believes it deserves more attention in the conversation about future-proofing homes in the North East. From protecting walls against rain and frost to reducing energy costs and preventing damp, modern render systems offer a long-term investment in both appearance and performance.\nFor homeowners in Scarborough, Newcastle, Whitby, Sunderland or York, the message is simple: don’t wait for visible damage indoors to take action. A quick glance outside could reveal the earliest signs of problems that, if left untreated, may require costly repairs down the line.\nMedia Contact",
