  "text": "The \"Karma\" singer also said her bond with Chris Hughes on the show was \"not one\" of the reasons behind her breakup with Ebbs\nBy Rachel DeSantis Rachel DeSantis Rachel DeSantis is a senior writer on the music team at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2019, and her work has previously appeared in Entertainment Weekly and the New York Daily News. People Editorial Guidelines Published on April 30, 2025 06:45PM EDT Comments JoJo Siwa on Nick Viall's The Viall Files podcast. Photo: Nick Viall/youtube\nJoJo Siwa opened up on The Viall Files about her breakup with Kath Ebbs Siwa said she was \"cussed out\" by her ex at the Celebrity Big Brother UK wrap party The star also said her breakup had nothing to do with Chris Hughes, with whom she formed a close bon on the show JoJo Siwa is opening up about her breakup with ex Kath Ebbs , just days after the Australian podcaster said they were “incredibly humiliated” by the relationship’s end.\nSiwa, 21, appeared on an episode of The Viall Files on Wednesday, April 30, and revealed the timeline of her split from Ebbs, 27, while reiterating the fact that her close bond with Chris Hughes on Celebrity Big Brother UK was not a factor, despite Ebbs hinting that it was in a TikTok video .\n“There’s so many reasons why my breakup happened. Christopher is not one of them,” Siwa said. “I actually told this to Kath, like, ‘Maybe it would be easier if he was!’ But he is not one of them, so if you’re going to share the story, share the story… Don’t paint it out to look like I cheated on you with him because I did not… I would not, and I have not.”\nThe “Karma” singer said she started having doubts as soon as she entered the Big Brother house earlier this month, as she saw a group photo of her and her family at Disney World and recalled being unhappy on the day the photo was taken.\nWho Is JoJo Siwa's Ex? All About Australian Podcast Host Kath Ebbs “It just opened a can of worms that… really did me in,” she said. “The second that I had a time to think… My brain just started to run with so many things that I have been OK with, that I have tolerated, that nobody should. It put a lot of things into perspective for me.”\nWhen she finally left the Big Brother house, Siwa was ready and excited to attend the show’s wrap party. Ebbs — who uses they/them pronouns — had allegedly told production they did not want to attend the party, but Siwa wanted to go regardless.\nThe Dance Moms alum said on The Viall Files that she warned Ebbs the party would end at a late hour, and because she needed time to decompress, suggested they have a deeper conversation the next day.\n“That upset them, rightfully so. They wanted to be with me. But I knew I wasn’t in a place for them,” Siwa said.\nAfter about an hour, Ebbs changed their mind about the party, Siwa said, and showed up.\nJojo Siwa and Kath Ebbs at the 36th Annual GLAAD Media Awards on March 27, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.

I’m getting cussed out,” Siwa recalled. “I understand where they’re angry and where they’re coming at me, but I also keep reiterating like, ‘I’m not in a place to talk.’... Anyway, by the 16th time somebody asks you, ‘Are you happy? Do you want to end things?’ You’re going to just spew your guts and I was honest and I said, ‘If you ask me tomorrow, I don’t know my answer. if you ask me right now, my answer is yes.’ And then that obviously was taken as yes, and it was a yes.”\nEbbs told their side of the story in a viral TikTok shared on April 26, during which they said they “flew across the world to support and be there and hold [Siwa] in whatever they would be experiencing, leaving such a wild experience, and instead, I was dumped at the afterparty, with Chris in the next room.”\nJoJo Siwa Says Relationship with Big Brother U.K. Costar Chris Hughes Is 'Platonic' as She Breaks Silence on Kath Ebbs Split Ebbs went on to accuse Siwa of “emotional cheating” with Hughes, as the two were seen cuddling, holding hands and sharing a forehead kiss over the course of the show.\n“In terms of Mr. Christopher, I don't know. I have opinions, [but] I'm not gonna say them now. In terms of their relationship, that's their journey, enjoy,” Ebbs said in their video.\nOn the podcast, Siwa said that Ebbs had asked her not to speak publicly about their breakup, but she wanted to present her side of the story in order to protect both herself and Love Island UK star Hughes, 32.\n“You don’t get to have it both ways,” she said. “But I understand wanting to share your truth, and that is the exact thing I told my ex. I said, ‘Look, if you would like to share what happened, if you would like to share how it happened, that’s totally fine. It’s your story. It’s your life. Please do not lead to the false narrative that’s already out there.’’\nClose Leave a Comment",
