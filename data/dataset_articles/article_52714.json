  "text": "The housing market is likely to favour buyers even more over winter, as vendors drop their asking prices to try and achieve a sale and buyers can choose from a mountainous stock of properties for sale.\nThe April data from property website Realestate.co.nz shows the national average asking price of residential properties on the site declined for the second month in a row in April to $851,746, down from $884,995 in February. That's a decline of $33,249 (-3.8%).\nAround the main centres, asking prices declined in Auckland -$46,035, Wellington -$40,066, Canterbury -$16,347 and Otago -$50,128. See the table below for the full regional figures.\nThe main cause of the current price weakness is the huge stock of properties on the market.\nThis has more than doubled over the last four years, rising steadily from 15,838 in April 2021 to 35,924 in April 2025. See the graph below for the monthly trends.\nAlthough the stock of properties declined by 946 between March and April this year, that was a very modest decline considering new listings onto the website fell by 838 over the same period.\nThat suggests more properties are sitting unsold on the market for longer.\nThose figures are particularly concerning because February and March are traditionally the busiest months of the year for residential real estate and the market is now on the downward slope into winter.\n\"There's plenty of stock on the market but we're not seeing a boom in sales activity to move it through yet,\" Realestate.co.nz Chief Executive Sarah Wood said.\nThat gives buyers plenty of choice, and with vendors dropping prices and mortgage interest rates low and possibly heading lower, the market is increasingly in buyers' favour.\nWe welcome your comments below.
