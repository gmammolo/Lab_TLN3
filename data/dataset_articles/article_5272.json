  "text": "Mötley Crüe has won the legal proceedings with the band’s former guitarist Mick Mars, after he initiated dispute.\nThe founding member retired from the heavy metal band in 2022 due to deteriorating health and maintained that he was only stepping back from touring, with John 5 taking his place on the road but that he would remain a member still.\nAround six months after his departure, the guitarist began demanding financial compensation and 25% of the touring revenue which went against a previous agreement he signed with the remaining members.\nAn independent arbitrator was then asked to step in and their decision has now been announced and comfirmed in a press release issued by Mötley Crüe’s lawyer, Sasha Frid of Miller Barondess, LLP.\nThe attorney stated, \"the arbitrator's ruling not only vindicates the band contractually and financially but also dismantles the public narrative Mars promoted in interviews with major outlets.\"\n“This dispute was about protecting the integrity and legacy of one of the most successful bands in rock history, with the arbitrator rejecting every claim and enforcing the parties’ agreements as written, the band has been fully vindicated—legally, financially, and factually,” they added.\nMick’s decision has completely backfired and not only will he not be receiving any profits but has also been ordered to pay $750,000 in unrecouped tour advances.\nRELATED: 'Masked Singer' features popular band mate in new episode",
