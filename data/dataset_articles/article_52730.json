  "text": "Kris Jenner's ultimate fashion choices have left fans in a questioning state.\nHollywood's favourite momager, Kris Jenner, has perfected the art of finding the best spotlight for her daughters, but sometimes that mark has missed her. Though Kris's style rarely misses the mark and can be described as bold and maximalist, there have been a few outfits from the past that have left fans confused and questioning.\nThe diva has definitely had some extremely notable fashion moments in her past, from her Toys For Tots Benefit look from Escada Margaretha in 1990, to a butter yellow Oscar De La Renta number at the 2022 Met Gala, a look ahead of today's trends, Kris has takes the cake in leaving an impact with her bold fashion choices.\nHere are 10 times the Kardashian-Jenner Matriarch has left her fans confused and offended:\nAll Metallic Concert look\nYes, the theme of Beyonce's Renaissance tour was metallics, silver and fringes, but maybe the Jenner mama dropped the ball in this one. The all silver look comprised of a silver trench coat, silver shoes, metallic pants, silver mesh like top, silver bag and, well you get the gist, making the look a tad on the nose, especially for a concert, a simple black or white tee or pants could have cut down the excess and given a nice contrast to the look.\nMET Gala 2019\nThe theme for the 2019 Met Gala was \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\", and Kris was definitely going for something daring with her Tommy Hilfiger look and platinum blonde bob, but compared to her other iconic MET looks, she may have dropped the ball on this one. The look was quite camp, going with the vibe of every gala, but it was veering more on the side of kitschy than anything else and given the theme, it seemed too costumy.\nKris Jenner during the 2002 ESPY Awards\nFor the 2002 ESPY (Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly) Awards, the icon attended the event with her ex-partner, Caitlyn Jenner, sporting a lacy little black dress with a signature yellow-and-purple Lakers leather jacket on top. The jacket was for sure on theme for the event, but it might have been a little too adventurous to pair it with a lacy black formal dress. Maybe a pair of black trousers, white shirt and black tie would have worked out better for the overall vibe, especially since the socialite has dropped some major pant suit looks over the years.\nVacation Mode Kris\nThough the Jenner mom drops major fashion week, red carpet looks, maybe casual looks are not something she has quite figured out. Decked out in a casual kaftan-style dress on a yacht, Kris was giving full vacation mode. The kaftan was made in the iconic Pucci print fabric and exhibits stunning and vibrant summer colours. However, the look seemed a bit lacklustre when donned by Kris Jenner.\nKris Jenner hot pink pants\nAnother controversial look of Kris that received quite a bit of backlash from the internet was this hot pink skinny jean look that she wore in 2012. The look consisted of a leather detail jacket, hot pink skinny pants, leopard print booties, square sunglasses and chunky silver jewellery. The outfit was definitely time appropriate with he 2010s statement jewellery pieces and the 2000s reminiscent love for leopard print, however, the look would work more for a 20-year-old Kim. According to one user,\n“She is a garish attention-seeker. She dresses too young for her age.”\nKris's Sportswear look\nMaybe sportswear and streetwear are not strong suits for the 69-year-old, as she tried to pair a cardigan with a half-zip hoodie inside. The combination of knitwear with sportswear was definitely brave. The pop of colour overall looked great; however, when closely analysed, something seems amiss. The strings of the hoodie definitely clash against the cardigan.\nKris at the 2010 Primetime Emmy Awards\nFor the 2010 Primetime Emmy Awards, Jenner was decked out in a one-shoulder patterned black and white belted dress with a black metallic geometric clutch, black chunky earrings, silver studded ring and black peep-toe studded heels. The dress had a retro-esque vibe to it, and the outfit featured many early 2000s trends, but for a red carpet that was as grand as the Emmys, the look was not for lack of a better word grand enough. Granted, the family was still not as big as it is today, and her red carpet style has evolved over the years; Jenner was not a stranger to the grandeur of major event styling.\nJenner at the Last Action Hero Premiere, 1993\nKris Jenner walked the Last Action Hero Premiere carpet with her partner in an all white look that tried to balance a formal carpet look with chunky, kitschy accessories. The all-white ensemble was a combination of an oversized white blazer and loose white trousers, which were very appropriate for the time period. However, the pantsuit was paired with a sheer white top with a V-shaped covering around the chest, making the sleek and chic outfit look a bit gaudy, especially paired with the gold charm waist chain.\nKris at The Hollywood Reporter’s Women In Entertainment Breakfast, 2015\nDecked in an all black gothic look, Jenne was spotted at the 2015 Hollywood Reporter’s Women In Entertainment Breakfast, wearing Anna K. As much as she likes to dress campy, the look overall didn't make quite a lot of sense, especially given the event and the fact that it was a day program. The design also didn't quite fit right on the entrepreneur, who usually stuns in black. The stockings also felt like overkill.\nKris at the People’s Choice Awards, 2021\nBeing a winter event, the momager was definitely dressed for the part in a velvet crimson suit set. However, the lighter shade of the top inside the top added a touch of tackiness to the entire look. A darker top or a contrasting colour would have helped break down the overwhelming impact of the look. She could have also achieved that with a statement bag or chunky rings.\nBut no matter what, at the end of the day, every celebrity faces fashion faux pas in their very public lives; in fact, it comes with the territory. However, it's more about Kris Jenner's aura and recovery that make her a true style icon.\nLove movies? Try our Box Office Game and Movie Grid Game to test your film knowledge and have some fun!",
