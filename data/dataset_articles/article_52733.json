  "text": "If your once-vigorous plant is starting to look sickly, spider mites may be the culprits. These tiny, plant-feeding arachnids hide in plain sight. At first, your plant may look a little “off,” but you may not be able to identify what’s going on because the teeny pests, which are related to spiders and ticks, are hard to see if you don’t know what you’re looking for.\nWithin short order, these pests multiply and wreak havoc on both indoor and outdoor plants, including annuals, perennials, edibles, and shrubs. “Spider mites suck small amounts of liquids and tissue from plants, causing light-colored stipples on the green leaves,” says Matt Bertone, PhD, entomologist and director of the NC State Plant Disease and Insect Clinic. “In large populations, the areas of damage can spread, giving plants a dull, greasy or yellow appearance. It’s usually about that time when people find the colonies of these pests under the leaves.” Large infestations kill a plant.\nTypically, you see damage to the plant before you notice the mites. “Most often, you may suspect a different pest, but it’s actually mites, which is why observation is really important,” says Rafia Khan, PhD, assistant professor and extension entomologist at Texas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension Center. “You will notice mottling or bronzing of the leaves, but when you look closely, you may see fine silk webbing, too.” You also may be able to see the mites moving around inside the webbing.\nThere are many different species of spider mites but the most common in the Southeast is the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae), says Bertone. This species feeds on a wide variety of plants. Other common spider mites include boxwood mite (Eurytetranychus buxi), spruce spider mite (Oligonychus ununguis), and the southern red mite (Oligonychus ilicis).\n- Matt Bertone, PhD, is an entomologist and director of the NC State Plant Disease and Insect Clinic.\n- Rafia Khan, PhD, is an assistant professor and extension entomologist at Texas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension Center.\nHow To Identify Spider Mites\nSpider mites live in colonies. They have no wings and are about .5mm in length, making them difficult to see with the naked eye, says Bertone. You may be able to see them with a 10 to 15x magnifying glass. They’re small, oval and have eight legs as adults. Hatchlings have only six legs. Different species are different colors, but most are pale, red or spotted. They’re especially common during hot, dry conditions.\nUnderstanding Spider Mites\nThe life cycle of these pests is rapid. Spider mite adults can lay several hundreds of eggs over a 2 to 4 week period, so you are often dealing with multiple generations at once during a severe infestation, says Khan. After the eggs hatch, every stage is mobile and can quickly spread to nearby plants.\nOutdoors, organisms, such as predators and fungi regulate populations. But in the dry indoor environment inside your house, these mites can attain huge populations due to the absence of anything to keep them in check, says Bertone.\nHow To Get Rid Of Spider Mites\nThese insidious pests can kill a plant (and spread to other plants) if left unchecked, so try these management tips from Bertone and Khan:\n- Inspect your plants. “You should regularly monitor your plants, not just when they are infested. This is especially important when you are bringing new plants indoors,” says Khan. Use a magnifying glass, and look on the underside of foliage where mites like to hide.\n- Watch for yellow, stippled leaves, especially on flowering or fruiting plants. If you see these telltale signs, make a closer inspection for the webbing.\n- Isolate infected houseplants. If you find mites on a houseplant, immediately move this plant away from others to prevent their spread.\n- Blast them off with a spray from the hose. This old-school trick is surprisingly effective. Use a garden hose, kitchen or shower sprayer to wash off every surface of the plant, including the tops and bottoms of foliage and in between leaves and branches. Pay special attention to areas of webbing, which protect the mites.\n- Repeat the spray. Because these mites reproduce rapidly and you’re often dealing with more than generation at a time, you must repeat the process every week to 10 days to deal with newly-hatched eggs or any mites you missed.\n- Limit pesticide use. Unfortunately, these pests quickly become resistant to some insecticides so that you may experience an even more severe outbreak. Therefore, reserve the use of these products for extreme infestations on high-value plants. Use\ninsecticidal soap,neem or horticultural oils, or Spinosad, and follow label instructions. Make sure to cover every surface of the plant, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices between stems. You may need to re-treat within a week or so. - Know when to call it quits. If you have treated a plant several times and are not making any headway, it may be time to cut your losses and toss the plant before others become infected.",
