  "text": "The city of St. Joseph is notifying the public the Whirlpool Compass Fountain below the bluff downtown won’t be opening on its traditional date of May 1 this year.\nSt. Joe Public Works Director Greg Grothous tells us ongoing improvements at the attraction have delayed things a little.\n“We really were optimistic and hoping that we would have it open as close to May 1 if possible,” Grothous said. “We are very close. I can’t give you an exact date for when it will reopen, but we’re pretty confident it will be open for sure by Memorial Day.”\nSo, what’s the issue?\n“There was a key component that was delayed in getting here. It is on site. It has been installed. So we can really ramp up connecting the pipes to get things put back together.”\nGrothous says a project years in the making continues as the city adds a new restroom facility, a new access path, drinking fountains, foot wash stations, shade structures, and signage to the fountain. He expects the Memorial Day target for getting the fountain operating again will be reached, but if you go down to Whirlpool Centennial Park Thursday expecting the jets to be shooting water, you may be disappointed.\nMeanwhile, if you do head down to the park, you may notice preparations being made for a new pedestrian traffic plan below the bluff. Large mounds of sand are now covering one of the sidewalks from the bluff stairs to Silver Beach County Park. The city is seeking to direct pedestrians to other sidewalks to help ease traffic congestion at the park during the summer.",
