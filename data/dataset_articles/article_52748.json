  "text": "Companies claim that Tyrannosaurus rex leather could soon be entering the luxury fashion market, but dinosaur researchers say you can't make genuine T. rex skin. The companies want to make luxury goods out of T. rex skin-inspired material. The bag in this image is crocodile leather.\nA partnership of companies has announced that it plans to make luxury fashion accessories out of Tyrannosaurus rex \"leather\" — but researchers say it won't be the real deal.\nThe T. rex leather will be produced in a lab and is intended to be an \"eco-friendly\" and \"cruelty-free\" alternative to traditional leather, according to a statement released by creative agency VML, one of the three companies involved.\nThe partnership, which also includes biotechnology companies Lab-Grown Leather Ltd and The Organoid Company, plans to base its new material on fossilized T. rex collagen, a common protein that provides structure to skin and other tissues. It will then make the material by engineering cells with synthetic, or artificially created, DNA.\nHowever, dinosaur experts told Live Science that making real T. rex leather would require DNA from the extinct predator, and there isn't any. Furthermore, paleontologists have only found T. rex collagen in bone, not skin, and skin is the basis for leather.\nThomas Holtz, Jr. , a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland, told Live Science that he thought the T. rex leather claim was \"misleading\" after reading the announcement. \"What this company is doing seems to be fantasy,\" Holtz said in an email.\nLive Science approached VML for comment, but it didn't provide one.\nRelated: 'Dispiriting and exasperating': The world's super rich are buying up T. rex fossils and it's hampering research\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world's most…\nPatrick Pester",
