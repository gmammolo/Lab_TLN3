  "text": "County approves BCSO grant applications\nSANDPOINT — In a business meeting last week, the Board of County Commissioners unanimously approved the Sheriff’s Office Marine Division to apply for two grant applications for waterway improvement funds.\nThe division was approved to submit two applications, one that would help finance the replacement motors for its largest patrol vessel and another that would aid in the installation of a breakwater at the Garfield Bay boat launch.\nBrought forth by Marine Patrol Lt. Doug McGeachy, the board first discussed the engine replacement application. According to a press release sent out by Sheriff Darryl Wheeler on Jan. 5, the vessel's engines are \"quickly approaching the end of their projected life cycle,\" making it necessary for the division to seek replacements to remain available to the public.\nTwo replacement engines are estimated to cost $75,000, with the grant amount covering $50,000 of the cost. A county match would be required for the remaining amount. The grant, according to McGeachy, would also cover the cost of removing the existing motors, installing the new motor, electric throttle controls, necessary steering upgrades and any retrofits that are required.\n“The motors will replace two existing motors that have been in service for approximately 15 years and are projected to reach the end of their life cycle at the end of the 2026 boating season,” read a memorandum submitted to the board. Funds for the project would be budgeted into the fiscal year 2027 budget.\nThe second application is for the installation of a breakwater and dock expansion project at the Garfield Bay boat launch. The boat launch, according to McGeachy, is the only dock facility where the department is able to moor a sheriff’s vessel during low pool conditions.\n“The county has suffered significant loss due to weather-related damage to equipment at this location, and this enhancement is necessary to protect county property while allowing for the continued presence of public safety resources at the location,” a memorandum submitted to the county said.\nUpdates for the proposed project would include installing a 40-foot breakwater in front of the existing docks to help protect the existing infrastructure and the Sheriff’s patrol vessel. The breakwater would also be decked, adding a 20-foot floating dock.\nThe project is estimated to cost $150,000, with the grant covering $125,000 of the projected costs. A county match of $25,000 is required for the grant. Similar to the first grant, funds will be budgeted into the 2027 fiscal year.\nIdaho’s Waterways Improvement Fund offers funding through a portion of the state’s gas tax revenues, and may be used for the protection and promotion of safety, waterways improvement, creation and improvement of parking areas for boating purposes, making and improving boat ramps and moorings, marking of waterways, search and rescue and all things related to such purpose, according to the grant’s description.\nEach grant application is required to have a minimum match of five percent, with motorized equipment requiring a minimum of 20%.\nOther municipalities, such as the city of Oldtown and Sam Owen Fire, are also seeking grant funding from Idaho’s Waterways Improvement Fund.",
