  "text": "Google has announced that it will discontinue support for the first and second generations of the Nest Learning Thermostat starting 25 October 2025. These models will no longer receive updates and will lose their connection to Google's cloud services.\nHere's What We Know This means that they cannot be controlled through the Google Home app or voice assistants. However, basic functions such as temperature control and scheduling on the device itself will remain available.\nDevices released in 2011 and 2012 for North America, as well as the 2014 European version, are eligible for discontinued support. Owners in the United States can upgrade to a new Nest (4th generation) at a discount of $130, and in Canada at a discount of CA$160.\nIn Europe, the situation is more complicated: Google has no plans to release new models compatible with local heating systems. Instead, Europeans are offered a 50% discount on Tado Smart Thermostat X. The company explained its decision by saying that heating systems in Europe are very different from each other. They have different technical features and require specific hardware and software solutions, which makes it difficult to create a universal device for most residential buildings.\nThe decision was part of a broader shift at Google's devices division, which also discontinued Nest Protect and Nest x Yale Lock. Despite the discontinuation of support, the first Nest thermostats lasted almost 15 years - much longer than the promised 5. However, this is still unpleasant news for many users.\nSource: MacRumors",
