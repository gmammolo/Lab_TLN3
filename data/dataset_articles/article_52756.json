  "text": "a week ago\nRadioApp will not load on my Nest Hub Max. Other nest devices in the same household are fine.\nHas been working fine, but stopped within the last week or so. Responds to my voice command \"Play 3AW' but then the loading process freezes. Other radio services seem fine (iHeartradio) works on the Hub max, but RadioApp does not.\nContacted Google support via email ... the suggested the usual reboot and update solutions ... no change. Opened a chat to Google support, nothing additional to help, but they did suggest to open a Feedback on the issue through the Google home app. When enough people report the same issue, it gets the attention of the next level support people, who should be able to resolve the issue.\na week ago - last edited a week ago\nYes ! Display won’t play Global but Nest Mini , Nest Audio & Nest Max all will. Who has the issue , Global or Google ? I have to admit as a loyal Google user for audio it’s lost its edge completely and I am seriously considering converting to the other side\n** Just found a workaround, if you open the radio station on a working speaker you can then add the non working speaker via the Google Home app then deselect the first speaker, hope that makes sense !**\nWednesday\nAlso, instruct google to “ Play via Tunein” Works for me 👍🏻\na week ago\nIt is also doing the same Rayo\na week ago\nYes, same problem here. My best home hub loads global player but it then closes. Briefly worked on my other (non display) speakers.\nseems to be a google wide issue then, as I thought this was just a case of my account unlinking or something.\na week ago\nTry my work around above , this is working consistently with success\nWednesday\nTry playing via Tunein 👍🏻\nThursday\nMy Google nest is doing the same but say what station you want to listen to followed by tune in.\nSo say for instance \"Hey Google Play Heart Dance Via Tune In\" and that'll get around this issue for now.\nThursday\nI have the same problem. Podcasts still working for me, so just a live radio issue I think.\nFriday\nhi yes, this happened to my Nest Hub Max 2 weeks ago, and now, my smaller display 7\" has gone the same way. This morning i hope it is a glitch they can fix and not a license issue with global\nMonday\nIm getting exactly the same issue, also the Rayo app for Hits radio isn't working either. All working fine on my home mini's just not on my nest display 😕\na week ago - last edited a week ago\nAfter France Info two months ago, an issue that has still to be resolved by the way, now the same is happening with BBC World Service, be it on :\nI use the Nest Mini H2C which seems to be more reliable. Whether I ask it in English or in French, it doesn't work. I've tried several French accents and several English accents.\nBBC World Service is still available on TuneIn : https://tunein.com/radio/BBC-World-Service-s322318/\nWhen I get to the BBC World Service website, it says \"We're replacing BBC Sounds outside the UK and bringing you BBC.com, a seamless way to read, watch, and listen - all in one place.\"\nCould that be the source of the problem ?\nI feel like throwing your products out the windows and buying a DAB+ radio.\na week ago\nWe have used out Google Nest Hub to listen to 2GB for a number of years. We live near Port Macquarie and it has always worked perfectly well. A couple of days ago it simply stopped playing 2gb. We can still access other programs like ABC radio however it just will not play 2gb? Please Google can you sort this out?\na week ago\nI've got the same issue in Melbourne, seems 3aw, 2gb, international radio stations have all stopped working. But ABC Radio still works as well as Spotify.\na week ago\nSame issue here. Only one out of the five speakers suddenly stopped playing 3AW. I can get ABC radio on the one that wont play 3AW also. Very strange.\n10 hours ago\nI can't get any radio station to work on mine, have even tried streaming it from my phone it pop's on the display but never plays any audio\n3 hours ago\nTheir saying the bug is fixed maybee April update was cause?\nMonday\nBrisbane is the same\nSaturday\nI am having the same problem, my speaker works fine but both displays are dead only on 3aw and 2gb. Google can you help us please\nyesterday\nInteresting to note, right as we are coming up to an election here the conservative radio stations begin to fail on Google but the Left ABC are fine. It may be suggested that our devices are trying to influence our polling! Fix this Google\nyesterday\nBizarre...I also can stream ABC radio through Radio App but no commercial stations. All sounds a bit Big Brother\n22m ago\nYes I am having the same problem no radio stations will pick up at all . Have emailed 2GB radio station to see if there is another frequency to tune in . Was my favourite station to stream all day . Very disappointing. No one seems to know a fix .\na week ago\nMy ability to play TuneIn radio stations on my Google Nest Hub stopped working on Friday Apr 18th and has not worked since.\nIs there a way to troubleshoot this issue? Currently the only way I have to test is to periodically try again, but there's not output, log files or other troubleshooting methods to determine where the issue is.\nThanks in advance\na week ago\nOk, by the read of it this is broader than just RadioApp which we use in Australia.\nThanks for posting. We are seemingly all in the same boat, now we wait for Google to help out I think.\na week ago\nDoes anyone from Google read these forums? Or is it just customers?\nIt would be great to know how to troubleshoot this issue. I've confirmed the radio station is working fine from the TuneIn website. This is affecting multiple Google Nest Hubs in my house, so it's not just one of them. I've power cycled the Hubs, but no change.\nThanks\na week ago\nI also performed a factory reset on one of my Google Nest Hubs and did not change the situation - TuneIn radio stations still are not playing, it plays the regular ads, then attempts to play the radio station, but just shows the TuneIn radio logo a couple of times in a row, like something is failing. iHeartRadio by comparison, works fine.\na week ago\nand I have the same problem. Streams encoded with the AAC codec don’t work. Only those with MP3\na week ago\nThat's interesting, how did you figure out AAC vs. MP3?\nMy Nest Hub Max will stream Radio, but it first has to be playing on the smaller Nest Hub. I can actually go to the screen on the Max and select the Hub Max to also play the radio. Bit of a work around, and relies on you having both devices.\nThursday\nInteresting angle, one wonders if TuneIn changed their media format on April 18? I would assume not, as that would break lots of things, such as what I'm seeing here, but wouldn't be the first time a \"safe\" change ends up breaking things.\nWould be nice if there was a way to troubleshoot this, to at least get some error messages or something to know where the problem may be. Right now it looks like Google, but it's impossible to tell for sure with what we have available to troubleshoot (ie basically nothing) 😞\na week ago\nA few days ago, both of my Google Home Hubs stopped playing the national ESPN radio station. I was using IHeartRadio (which is my default radio player, I already checked). It says it is connecting, it starts to connect, the IHeartRadio logo pops up and ... nothing! Just the logo on the screen for a minute or so and then it goes back to the clock. I tried unplugging for 30 second, still won't load.\nI just tried to load ESPN Radio using TuneIn. It worked except now I have to listen to TurnIn ads. I'm not spending $99/year for something that was free through IHeart.\nWhat update from Hades did Google upload that broke my ability to listen to sports radio.\na week ago - last edited a week ago\nI'm having the same issue (not able to play anything on iHeart Radio or Audacy). This is with the Google Home Hub. However, both work fine on my Hub Max. Also unable to Chromecast iHeart or Audacy to either of my Home Hubs. Both worked fine previously.\nThursday\nI have the same problem. Have reported to google several times and to RadioApp.. i have heard nothing back. I have also contacted several radio stations for help, but its not them as other friends are still able to use RadioApp on their home googles.. i have also factory reset it .. have deleted an reinstalled the home app also.. nothing has helped.. after 2 years with no problems and now silence, its nice to know i am not the only one\nFriday\nThank God it's not just me. It's been frustrating me for the past fortnight.\nNot very helpful when I use Heart UK to wake me up as part of my morning automation 🤣\nSunday\nYou are lucky you are able to use media alarms - never worked for me - apparently because I use a 'UK English voice'.\nFriday\nMy Nest Hub Max and now my smaller 7\" display have stopped streaming the Global Player and Rayo Radio apps. Are there any clues? Is there a fix forthcoming? Do you know?\nSunday\nSame but my speakers works, seems to be somthing with devices with displays for me\nFriday - last edited Friday\nMine is exactly the same only responds to my command but my radio station doesn’t come on my nest only on the other small devices.\nFriday\nSame for me in the UK.... Global Player and Rayo don't work.\na week ago\nWhy is Google nest hub 2nd gen and Google nest Max not being sold in Australian stores anymore?\na week ago\nYou can select the 'Notify me\" button when stock becomes available, but I don't know when or if stock will ever become available again. They've had no stock for a long time now.\nThey're still selling the Google Pixel Tablet (and charging base) so...🤷\na week ago\nI thought my Nest Hub was faulty and looking to replace it, but now im seeing lots of other customers devices are also not running radio stations anymore, so a new device probably doesnt help.\nI 'think' google are about to drop replacement devices with gemini or something.. which is why they are out of stock, but im not sure if thats months away..",
