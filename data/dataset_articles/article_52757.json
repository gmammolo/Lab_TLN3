  "text": "01-18-2025 06:19 PM\nHi all i hope in posting this in the right area. I have had google nest 3 pack for 3 years now. Lately with lots of drop outs. At least 5 dropouts a week. I decides to factory reset everything including my app and profile and start fresh.\nI'm having a really frustrating issue when I connect the wifi point to the nest router and it gets to the end when it's adding it to the wifi network and just stays there for ever. Can anyone help this has beat me. 3 hours in I'm asking for help before I go buy a new system.\nAnswered!\nGo to the Recommended Answer.\n02-19-2025 11:40 AM\nHey everyone,\nThank you for your patience. This issue has been fixed alongside the release of Google Home app 3.29, all users should have received the update by now. If you're running a different version of the app, double check for updates in the Play Store and try restarting your device. If that doesn't fix the issue for you, please let us know in a comment below.\n02-13-2025 01:37 PM\nThe culprit is the Home app on Android.\nWorkarounds are:\n1. Use an iOs device\nOr\n2. Uninstall Home and sideload the older Home 2.59 apk that has been shared at other places in this merged thread\nFix is coming in Home 3.29\n02-13-2025 03:57 PM\nI've done the iOS and side load options and 3 of 4 my access points are still not functional.\nThe 3 originals don't work at all. The issue for me is a combination of a access point update and the home app.\n02-14-2025 08:20 PM\nGoogle quietly rolled out overnight version 3.29 to Google home . Shame on the nest team for no info this was coming out or when , I only noticed it had auto updated as I've been checking. I'll update later if this has resolved adding the points on .\n02-14-2025 09:16 PM\nGoogle Home v3.29 has been rolled out overnight and finally resolved the problem for me. Hope it works for the rest of you!\n02-18-2025 06:05 PM\nARGH Am I the only one who can't get it to work with 3.29 (after factory reset)?\n02-18-2025 07:24 PM\nWe're in the clear here too. New version, factory reset. All added again. Only took an entire month +.\n02-19-2025 11:40 AM\nHey everyone,\nThank you for your patience.

Where is the technical support? Or are they asleep?!\nMonday\nStill not working!!\n3 weeks ago\nThis is not fixed. So annoying. How come biggest software vendor can not fix simple issues like this.\n3 weeks ago\nit is fixed - have you updated the Home app on your phone?\n2 weeks ago\nToday a new update google home is available in iOS with the but the same problem still exists\nversion 3.32\nplease fix this problem\n2 weeks ago\nYes it is NOT fixed in latest version also. The actual issues is adding GOOGLE WIFI points models NLS-1304 to the mesh. They stuck at the end. The other google wifi point models AC-1304 do get added with out any issue so google home team need to check handshake between router and wifi point in the finalise step for this specific NLS-1304 model to understand the difference and fix it. Hope this helps to pin point the diagnosis and fix it the most annoying issue for lot of people. Else all these wifi points (Nls-1304) are just paper weights which google can use it in their offices.\nSaturday\nIt's pitiful. It used to be so easy in the old days. Now your waste hours, with recommendations like factory reset everything. Why? Your should be able just to add it easily. Unfortunately I have been with Google wifis for like ten years, but if I could I would switch to another company. Google has become so inefficient. Sorry to say but it's true.\na week ago\nupdate google home is available in iOS with the but the same problem still exists\nversion 3.32\nSaturday\nI have tried all the recommendations, nothing is working. It shouldn't be like this. I just want to add 1 wifi point. Should be easy.\nSaturday\nThis is ridiculous. Been trying to get this working for so long\nMonday\nThis issue is persisting with me as well. Trying to add one Google Wifi point to existing mesh network and stuck at adding to mesh stage. have tried factory reset, hardwiring, power cycling, etc. multiple versions of app with no luck.\nMonday\nI gave up! I went out and bought a whole new system (ubiquiti dream pro 7). I had a great 10-year run with Google Wi-Fi. this is so disappointing.\nBye bye Google\nMonday\nYes. I have had them for years and recommended them to probably 5 other families but I wouldn't anymore. They are slower than the competition (I have 1 giga on my modem, but never more then 500 on my nest plugged into the modem). And now this inability to add a puck. And solutions like factory reset the whole system etc. one is not even confident that after resetting the system it will work as before. Zero confidence, sorry\nMonday\nA failed experience with technical support. I was contacted after posting more than 10 topics in Google's forum, but technical support was unsuccessful and impossible. After 4 hours of communicating with me directly and sharing the network with support, they failed to solve the problem and ignored the response. What happened to you, Google? What happened to you? Is it reasonable that a large technical support is unable to solve a problem that everyone has complained about!!?\n14m ago\nNow 148 REPLIES\nand support google\nHe does not react, does not care, and has not found any solution to the problem.",
