  "text": "American Idol season 23 has been a total snoozefest so far, putting me to sleep with every episode, but I think that a night without ballads could energize the show, and really make the finalists shine. American Idol season 23 welcomed back host Ryan Seacrest, along with judges Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan. However, for the first time in the ABC era of the show, there was a shakeup at the judging table as American Idol season 4 winner Carrie Underwood took Katy Perry's place.\nAmerican Idol season 23 has now narrowed down its contestants to its Top 10 finalists. They include Thunderstorm Artis, John Foster, Canaan James Hill, Kolbi Jordan, Josh King, Slater Nalley, Breanna Nix, Mattie Pruitt, Jamal Roberts, and Gabby Samone. They're all incredibly talented, but I've found myself very bored during the episodes. I think this is because there have been hardly any upbeat performances throughout the competition so far. The finalists have been relying on ballads to showcase their vocals, but I think a night without ballads could reinvigorate the show.\nThe American Idol Top 10 Finalists Have Sung Too Many Ballads\nThey Haven't Taken Advantage Of The Theme Nights\nSo far, American Idol season 23 has had three theme nights, including Songs of Faith, Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and Iconic American Idol Moments. Although the finalists gave some extraordinary performances, many of them were ballads, which became very tedious to watch and listen to. On Rock & Roll Hall of Fame night, Carrie lamented that the contestants weren't rocking out, and I agreed with her completely.\nWhile a few of the contestants sang some upbeat songs, including Filo's \"With a Little Help from My Friends,\" Mattie's \"Piece of My Heart,\" John's \"Jailhouse Rock,\" Jamal's \"Shout,\" and Josh's \"The Longest Time,\" the episode concluded with several ballads including, Thunderstorm's \"Fire and Rain,\" Gabby's \"Saving All My Love for You,\" Breanna's \"Open Arms,\" Ché's \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World,\" and Slater's \"Your Song.\"\nRelated\n20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nReality TV is more popular than ever. With so many to choose from, here are some of the best reality TV shows to stream or watch right now.\nIn the midst of all of those ballads, Kolbi sang, \"You're All I need to Get By,\" but there were already too many slow songs in a row in order to catch my attention. In addition, it was the third time that \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" was performed in full during the season, with Ché singing it after Amanda Barise and Mattie. I don't understand why the show would allow three contestants to sing the same song in such a short period of time, especially because it's a ballad that doesn't do much to showcase the contestants' personalities.\nDuring Iconic American Idol Moments Night, every single contestant sang ballads. Although their performances were impressive, after two nights in a row of that many ballads, I was exhausted by the end of the show. On both Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Night and Iconic American Idol Moments Night, the contestants could've chosen more upbeat songs instead of so many ballads.\nThe possibilities from the night's mentor alone, Fantasia Barrino, included \"Proud Mary,\" \"Think, \"Something to Talk About,\" \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours),\" \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine,\" \"Get on Your Feet,\" \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love,\" \"Knock on Wood,\" \"Holding Out for a Hero,\" and \"Chain of Fools,\" among others. I don't understand why none of the Top 10 finalists took advantage of such an incredible list of songs. I really hope that, during Women in Music Night, mentor Miranda Lambert, who's known for her sassy personality, encourages the Top 10 finalists to choose some uptempo songs that showcase a whole new side to their personalities.\nAmerican Idol Used To Have More Upbeat Performances\nContestants Showcased Their Vocals With More Than Just Ballads\nI've been watching American Idol since season 1, and some of my favorite performances have been upbeat songs that weren't ballads. Season 1 winner Kelly Clarkson was known for her bubbly performances, including her classic, \"Stuff Like That There.\" I also enjoyed season 5 winner Taylor Hicks' exciting performances of songs such as \"Takin' It to the Streets,\" \"Living for the City,\" \"Play That Funky Music,\" \"Jailhouse Rock,\" and \"Try a Little Tenderness.\" His dancing always made me smile.\nRelated\nAfter Katy Perry's Space Mission, I'm Convinced Retooling The American Idol Judges Panel With Carrie Underwood Was The Right Move\nKaty Perry has just completed a space mission which has me convinced that American Idol was right to replace her with Carrie Underwood.\nIn addition, American Idol season 5 runner-up Katharine McPhee often wowed the crowd with her uptempo songs and dancing in performances such as \"Since I Fell for You,\" \"Think,\" \"Bringing Out the Elvis,\" \"Black Horse and the Cherry Tree,\" and \"Hound Dog/All Shook Up.\" They made it to the final two of their season because they were so much fun to watch, and I always looked forward to seeing what they'd do next.\nTaylor and Katharine are just two examples of people who really brought star quality to the show by taking chances with songs other than ballads now and then. Of course, they also sang some gorgeous ballads during their time on American Idol, but they were much more versatile than today's contestants.\nAmerican Idol seems to have forgotten that part of its purpose is to entertain viewers, and not just showcase vocals. Although I know that the performances are technically great, I find it very tiresome to watch the contestants singing ballad after ballad, as though that's the only way to prove that they're good performers. It seems a bit self-indulgent, when they should be focusing on crowd-pleasing performances. Being an entertainer also requires singers to work the crowd, get them involved, and maybe even dance a bit. It's not as though the themes haven't allowed for that.\nAmerican Idol Should Have A Night Without Ballads\nThe Show Should Challenge The Finalists To Move Out Of Their Comfort Zones\nI know that the American Idol Top 10 finalists could really benefit from the show forcing them not to sing ballads. They all have great personalities that just aren't coming through each week. I want to see them move out of their comfort zones and do something fun and exciting to enhance their phenomenal performances. However, American Idol must enforce the theme.\nDuring American Idol season 22, I think that the show was trying to do this with their Songs That Make You Want to Dance Night, but Emmy Russell turned Walk the Moon's \"Shut Up and Dance\" into a ballad, and even sat at the piano during her performance. I wanted to see her come out of her shell, but it didn't happen. However, if American Idol devoted a night to songs that weren't ballads, then the contestants wouldn't be able to do this.\nAs an American Idol fan since season 1, I really miss seeing contestants take chances on the show by singing songs other than ballads. I think that the show should have a theme night during which the finalists aren't allowed to sing them. It would breathe new life into the show and make it much more entertaining to watch. I want to be able to watch an entire episode without feeling like I'm being sung to sleep. American Idol season 23 needs to put the ballads to bed.\nAmerican Idol airs Sundays and Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on ABC.\nSource: American Idol/YouTube, iwan13111980/YouTube, American Idol/YouTube\nYour comment has not been saved\nAmerican Idol\n- Release Date\n- 2002 - 2016-00-00\n- Showrunner\n- Nigel Lythgoe\n- Franchise(s)\n- American Idol\nCast\n-\nBrian Dunkleman\n- Creator(s)\n- Simon Fuller",
