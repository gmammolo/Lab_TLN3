  "text": "All eyes are on The Golden Bachelor’s next lead, Mel Owens, but could the football star have joined the competition for all the wrong reasons? Mel would be the second to lead the senior dating spin-off, following last season's Gerry Turner. Gerry, while passionate about the competition and his contestants, didn’t find lasting love. After whittling down his 22 contestants to just two finalists, Gerry proposed to Theresa Nist. He and Theresa embarked on a three-month marriage before their ultimate divorce. With this history, fans are hoping Mel finds more success through the dating competition.\nMel seems to have the best intentions for The Golden Bachelor season 2, but he may be concealing red flags. He is no stranger to this limelight, as Mel played professional football on behalf of the LA Rams for 9 seasons. After this lengthy NFL stint, Mel retired from the industry and set his focus on law and justice, specifically regarding sports-related injury cases. He’s now living a quieter life, but Mel could be craving stardom once more. If Mel enters the competition with the sole purpose of fame and entertainment, countless hearts could be broken.\nMel May Only Join For The Experience\nCould He Just Be Bored?\nMel’s accustomed to the limelight. After years of being a star football player, Mel’s quieter life may not be as fulfilling. He could be seeking out the fame and fortune he once knew, and reality TV is one of the best places to start an influencer career. The Ringer discusses this phenomenon, explaining that franchises like The Bachelor can attract contestants for the “wrong reasons,” such as online attention. The article’s author, Alyssa Bereznak, aptly writes:\n“The Bachelor franchise has become a launchpad for influencers who sell a wide range of lifestyle products, sustain a growing media ecosystem, and function as recurring characters within the show’s extended universe.”\nWhile audiences tune in to follow the drama and, ideally, lasting love, the franchise has undeniable ties with budding influencer careers. Mel could be one of many stars who have joined the cast, hoping for a platform rather than a genuine love story. His life has undergone radical changes, from star status to fatherhood and divorce. Mel could be looking for some excitement again.\nMel’s two sons, Lucas and Andre, are leaving the nest. Following the divorce, Mel focused his attention on raising his children. The Golden Bachelor’s press release informed audiences that after his father’s passing and the divorce, “Owens channeled his energy into being the best father he could be, focusing on raising his sons and coaching their extracurricular sports teams.” Now that they are college-aged and moving out, Mel may want a new challenge. The show could provide this. However, this could signify inauthentic intentions.\nMel May Not Be Interested In Women His Age\nMel’s Ex Was Much Younger Than He\nEven if Mel enters the competition with a genuine interest in finding love, the show's age bracket does not correlate with his dating history. Mel divorced his wife, whom he refers to as his “first love,” in 2020. His ex-wife, revealed to be Fabiana Pimental, was married to Mel for nearly 18 years. The pair tied the knot when she was just 21 years old.\nMel is 19 years older than Fabiana.\nThe age gap between Mel and his previous wife is substantial. Mel was 40 when he committed to the relationship with the 21-year-old. Now, he is entering a senior-oriented dating competition with women in their 60s. Mel may not have the same interest in these more mature contestants.\nThe age bracket for women contestants on The Golden Bachelor is 60 to 75 years old.\nThe show revolves around dating at a later stage in life, and the minimum age for each bachelorette starts at 60 years old. If younger women are more likely to pique Mel’s interest, his contestants could be set up for failure. Assuming that he is genuinely searching for love, the age ranges of the women involved could sway Mel’s opinion. Hopefully, Mel enters the competition with an open mind and heart.\nDoes Mel Have The Best Intentions?\nMel Could Break Hearts\nMel seems like an authentic candidate. He claims a legitimate interest in finding his forever partner through the dating competition. Mel endured his fair share of heartbreak, and hopefully, his experiences will encourage a genuine and kind approach to the season.\nIf the former football star enters with malicious intent, contestants and fans could be devastated. He may damage the show’s reputation further by promoting the idea that contestants enter for the “wrong” reasons. Only time will tell if The Golden Bachelor will exceed expectations and disprove franchise tropes.\nThe Golden Bachelor is available to stream on Hulu.\nSource: The Ringer\nYour comment has not been saved\nThe Golden Bachelor\n- Release Date\n- September 28, 2023\n- Network\n-\nABC\nCast\n-\nJesse Palmer\n-\nJesse Palmer",
