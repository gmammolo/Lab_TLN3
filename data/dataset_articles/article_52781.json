  "text": "LMAO … I know who I’m NOT betting on Saturday.\nWhen it comes to the 2025 Kentucky Derby , there’s a horse named Journalism , who is the favorite. Yeah, I know, I laughed too. There’s no way I can bet on a horse named that with how much I hate the media in 2025. But it’s not shocking that Journalism is on top of the odds.\nThe colt, a 3-year-old who was sired by Curlin , tallied a 4-0-1 record in five races and notably had a victory April 5 in the Santa Anita Derby. But that’s not the only thing that Journalism has won. He’s also snagged journalists’ hearts who are covering the Derby . (RELATED: Toby Keith-Owned Horse Is Running In Kentucky Derby)\nMost are choosing Journalism to win the big race, while a few others are either riding with Coal Battle or Sovereignty .\nHere is the complete field of the 2025 Kentucky Derby :\nCitizen Bull (20-1) Neoequos (30-1) Final Gambit (30-1) Rodriguez (12-1) American Promise (30-1) Admire Daytona (30-1) Luxor Cafe (15-1) Journalism (3-1) Burnham Square (12-1) Grande (20-1) Flying Mohawk (30-1) East Avenue (20-1) Publisher (20-1) Tiztastic (20-1) Render Judgment (30-1) Coal Battle (30-1) Sandman (6-1) Sovereignty (5-1) Chunk Of Gold (30-1) Owen Almighty (30-1) Post Positions for the 151st Kentucky Derby presented by Woodford Reserve. pic.twitter.com/CGyJn9rmy2\n— Kentucky Derby (@KentuckyDerby) April 26, 2025\nTo be honest, I’m not the most knowledgeable on horse racing, so I don’t know what I’m going to do exactly when it comes to betting. But with that being said, the Kentucky Derby is an event that I always show up for and have no problem slapping $5 on horses that I’ve never heard of to win.\nAdd a little day drinking, and you’ve got yourself an epic Saturday.",
