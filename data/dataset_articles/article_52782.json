  "text": "A star-studded sci-fi flop of recent years has made its way onto Prime Video in the UK and Ireland.Released in 2016, Passengers stars Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt as Aurora and Jim, two colonists who are suddenly woken up during their suspended hibernation journey to a colonised planet and risk dying a horrible death.But not even the double whammy star power of Lawrence and Pratt could save Passengers from negative reviews.The film from director Morten Tyldum and writer Jon Spaihts may boast a stacked cast — with Michael Sheen, Laurence Fishburne, and Andy García joining the two protagonists — but it only has a 30% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes.Related: Best streaming services UK 2025 — including Disney Plus, Netflix, iPlayer and Apple TV+Despite the scathing reviews, and a debate over the film's handling of consent and some problematic sex scenes, Passengers fared decently at the box office, ultimately earning $303.1 million worldwide.If you wish to take a look for yourself and decide what to make of Passengers, the film was added to Prime Video yesterday in both the UK and Ireland.Prior to Passengers, Tyldum directed biopic The Imitation Game, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing, as well as Keira Knightley in the role of Joan Clark.Related: Gerard Butler's disaster flop becomes a Netflix hitFor the movie, the filmmaker earned a Best Director nomination at the 2014 Oscars, but lost to Alejandro G Iñarritu for Birdman. Tyldum has also directed for television, being behind the camera of episodes of Apple TV+ series Defending Jacob and Silo. Passengers is streaming on Prime Video in the UK and Ireland. In the US, the film is available on the same platform.Digital Spy's first print magazine is here! Buy British Comedy Legends in newsagents or online now, priced at £7.99.",
