  "text": "Former child star Shaun Weiss missed out on reuniting with his Mighty Ducks co-stars in the sequel series that streamed on Disney+. However, he's now gotten his chance to reunite with several of his co-stars from the movies in new photos posted online.\nOn Instagram, Weiss, who played Greg Goldberg in the Mighty Ducks films, shared some new photos of himself at Eerie Culture Fest in Ohio, where he appeared as a celebrity guest. Fellow Mighty Ducks stars who were present were Aaron Schwartz (Dave Karp, The Mighty Ducks), Matt Doherty (Lester Averman, The Mighty Ducks 1-3), and Marguerite Moreau (Connie Moreau, The Mighty Ducks 1-3); Weiss and Schwartz also co-starred in Heavyweights. Weiss posted photos of himself with each of these actors, along with another image of himself with fellow former child star Jonathan Lipnicki (Stuart Little, Jerry McGuire). The images can be seen below.\nRelated\n'We Don't Want to Pursue That': Emilio Estevez Describes His Mighty Ducks 4 Script Rejected by Disney\nEstevez, who starred as Coach Gordon Bombay in all three Mighty Ducks movies, shares plot details for the rejected film.\nDoherty and Moreau were two of a handful of original Mighty Ducks trilogy stars to appear for a reunion in the Disney+ sequel series, The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers. Other originals who appeared in the show include Elden Henson (Fulton Reed), Garette Henson (Guy Germaine), Vincent A. LaRusso (Adam Banks), and Justin Wong (Ken Wu). In 2023, the show was canceled after two seasons and later removed from streaming from Disney+. If the show was renewed for a third season, it's possible that Weiss could have gotten a chance to reprise his role as Goldberg, as he had just returned to acting after a long hiatus right when Game Changers was given the ax at Disney+.\nShaun Weiss Has Returned to Performing\nWhile the unfortunate timing may have caused Weiss to miss out on the TV show, fans may still be happy to know he's getting other opportunities to see his old friends from the Mighty Ducks films. It may also be wonderful for many to see Weiss doing so well at this point in his life following years of struggles. After growing up as a child star, Weiss started to drift away from acting as he got older, and after a small role in 2008's Drillbit Taylor, he disappeared from the screen.\nRelated\n[\n'Not Sure [Disney's] Aware They Made It': Ben Stiller Reflects On Controversial Comedy 30 Years Later\n](/heavyweights-ben-stiller-disney-tweet/)\nBen Stiller addresses the 30th anniversary of his Disney comedy that has been subjected to retroactive controversy.\nIn the following years, Weiss struggled with houselessness, substance abuse, and legal troubles. He seemingly hit rock bottom following an arrest in January 2020, and fans were shocked to see the former child star looking unrecognizable when new images hit the web. A fundraiser was launched by a friend to help get Weiss back on his feet, with many fans across the world contributing, and he has stayed sober ever since, celebrating five years clean in January. He announced the month prior that he's expecting to be a father after learning that his girlfriend, Shannon, was pregnant. The two also stated they're planning to get married.\nMeanwhile, Weiss has also resumed his work as an entertainer. He had a role in 2023's Jesus Revolution, officially putting him back on the screen to revive his acting career. Weiss has also been performing stand-up comedy.\nSource: Shaun Weiss on Instagram\nFor anyone who needs assistance with substance abuse, the SAMHSA helpline can be reached at 1-800-662-HELP.
