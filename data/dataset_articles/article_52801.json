  "text": "Celebrities\nThe Valley’s Jesse Lally Reacts to Ex Michelle Saniei’s Claims That He’s ‘Broke’: ‘Inappropriate’\nJesse Lally and estranged wife Michelle Saniei's divorce is getting uglier by the episode on The Valley season 2.\nWhile defending herself against Jesse's claims that she slept with a man for money, Michelle, 36, accused him of being \"broke\" during the Tuesday, April 29, episode of the Bravo series. However, Jesse, 43, claimed otherwise.\n\"He is the one who is broke,\" Michelle tearfully said to her costars Brittany Cartwright, Nia Sanchez and Daniel Booko. \"He cannot pay for rent. He spent all of our money, and he left me with nothing. He doesn't pay me one dollar of child support. Nothing. And now he's making up this rumor about me? I have a daughter, and he doesn't care.\"\nJesse reacted to Michelle's comments during The Valley After Show and called her financial claims \"inappropriate.\"\n\"That should be saved for the family, but if Michelle wants to use it as her ammunition, then I'm just not going to comment on it,\" he said alongside costar Jax Taylor and Tom Schwartz.\nHowever, Michelle didn't hold back during the After Show and shed light on what their life used to look like before she gave birth to their daughter, Isabella Bunny Lally, in 2020.\n\"We were very successful, in 2018, 2019, before I was pregnant, we were selling $20 million houses – $45 [million]. We did a $60 million deal and we were doing very, very good.\"\nMichelle said that their finances took a tumble after Isabella was born, leading her to \"work less.\" In turn, the real estate agent claimed that Jesse also \"stopped working,\" but continued to spend money.\n\"We did have millions of dollars, and that money was gone,\" Michelle said.\nJesse later shared his side and shared that he and Michelle were \"50-50 business partners.\"\n\"So, if our business was failing, we're both at equal fault – and Michelle had 100 percent access to all of our accounts,\" he shared, later adding, \"So, if there was an issue with spending, Michelle is 100 percent at fault as well. And that's really all that I'm going to say about it.\"\nJesse and Michelle split in October 2023, one month after filming wrapped for The Valley season 1.\n\"I had the conversation with Jesse at the beginning of October that it was no longer going to work and I wanted to file for divorce,\" the family matriarch explained during an April 2024 episode of the \"When Reality Hits\" podcast. \"Jesse and I have actually not been together since October, and since then, we were free to date and do whatever we want.\"\nThe pair has since moved on and entered new relationships.\nMichelle confirmed she was in a relationship in April 2024 and went Instagram official with boyfriend Aaron Nosler two months later. The financial advisor made his debut on The Valley during season 2.\nJesse, for his part, went public with his girlfriend, Lacy Nicole, in April 2024. The couple are still together, despite Scheana Shay claiming that Lacy cheated on Jesse during The Valley season 2.\n\"The reason we're calling is, Michelle and I are here talking about my friend in Orange County. She just said to you that she's been sleeping with other guys,\" Jesse said to the Vanderpump Rules alum via phone call. \"Is that true or false?\"\nScheana, 39, claimed it was \"correct verbatim,\" adding, \"Even told me specifically who. The guy from Baywatch.\"\nNeither Jesse nor Lacy has addressed the cheating rumors.\nCopyright 2025 A360 Media. All rights reserved.\nThis story was originally published April 30, 2025 at 7:24 PM.",
