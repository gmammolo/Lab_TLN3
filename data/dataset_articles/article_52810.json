  "text": "ITV\nThe latest ITV gameshow sees David Tennant host 11 contestants in a bid to win big money\nTrending on GB News\nITV Genius Game viewers were left switching off from the latest game show, which is hosted by David Tennant, with many claiming it’s “overcomplicated”.\nThe brand-new reality game show sees strategically minded players, chosen not just for their high intellectual prowess but also their social IQ, face the ultimate battle of survival.\nTo win, contestants have to participate in a host of never-before-seen games all designed to not only test their intellectual acumen but also encourage them to carefully and creatively use the art of manipulation to outfox their opponents and win a cash prize.\nDuring the first episode, Tennant guided the eleven players, with exceptional abilities, through a series of mind-bending games.\nThe players needed to work together to be successful, but there could be only one winner.\nIn the first “Main Match”, the players faced Gold Heist, which challenged them to work together if they want to stay in the game.\nDavid Tennant hosts ITV's latest game show\nITV\nIf they won, they would have received a Token of Life and, alongside themselves, got the chance to choose a player to save.\nBut the losing player had to go head-to-head in the ultimate “Death Match”, choosing their opponent from the remaining players.\nThe loser was eliminated from the competition. With the stakes being high and with pressure on, it was a chance for the contestants to show if they would have been able to hold their nerve for the next round.\nHowever, as excited viewers began to tune in and were looking forward to a new gameshow, many were left disappointed and switched off.\nThe 11 contestants all competing for a high prize pot\nITV\nTaking to X, one penned: “#GeniusGame you need to be a genius to watch it. It's like @ITV producers thought 'How can we compete with #bbctraitors'.\n“Brain is completely fried. Totally overcomplicated! Don't think I will continue to watch.”\nSomeone else said: “I feel like I should watch #GeniusGame just in order to prove that it can't be that difficult to understand.\n“But then it's an ITV reality show and I'm not a gormless, braindead f***wit so I just won't.”\nA third raged: “I thought us thick people could just enjoy watching the nerds I never realised we had to BE a genius to enjoy the show.”\nAnother wrote: “How can anybody enjoy this programme if nobody understands how it works? The instructions are completely confusing with no recap whatsoever!\nViewers claimed the new show was trying too hard to be like The Traitors\nBBC\n“It’s like a cheap knock-off of The Traitors! Another poor programme from ITV!”\n“I know I’ve had a few beers but what the actual fuck? If you have to be a genius to even watch it, let alone take part?!?!” a fifth expressed.\nA sixth agreed: “I'm there for reality TV evolving and all that, but not at the expense of compromising entertainment value for overly complicated rules. This feels like hard work.” (sic)",
