Despite recent sightings of both celebrities spending time with different social circles, insiders say there’s no trouble in paradise.\nSocial media buzz ignites breakup rumors after separate outings\nFans were quick to raise eyebrows when Kelce was seen enjoying a night out in Las Vegas with his brother Jason Kelce and pop icon Justin Timberlake. Around the same time, Swift was notably absent from his side, prompting users on social media to question the status of their relationship.\nOne post read: “Taylor and Travis break up proof: *haven’t been together in over a month *Travis spends all his free time in Miami or Vegas *Taylor’s entire family flew to her in NYC for Easter *Travis unfollowed Ryan [Reynolds], one of Taylor’s closest friends.”\nCongratulations!\nYou have successfully cast your vote\nThe buzz intensified when fans noticed Kelce had unfollowed actor\nRyan Reynoldson Instagram, a close friend of Swift.

Although she was not seen in any paparazzi photos, she reportedly entered Le Chalet via the garage, with an eyewitness spotting her security team on-site.\nA strong foundation and future plans beyond the public eye\nThe couple, who began dating in 2023, previously spent private time together at a romantic, undisclosed vacation spot and even enjoyed a snowy retreat in Montana in March. These getaways helped them “reconnect” away from media glare.\nMeanwhile, Kelce is laser-focused on the upcoming NFL season.
