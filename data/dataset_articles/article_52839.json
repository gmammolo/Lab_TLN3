  "text": "Next winter, Survivor will celebrate its 50th season, which is set to consist of returning players only. So far, fan favorites such as Carolyn Wiger and Spencer Bledsoe have already said they will not appear on the landmark season, with both former castaways and fans not happy about the decision. However, throughout the last month, other Survivor legends have either been uninvited to compete on season 50, or have simply chosen to reject offers, leading many fans to be surprised by the names who won't make their return to the show in the near future.\n'Coach' Announces He's Retired\nBenjamin “Coach” Wade is undoubtedly one of the most popular Survivor contestants of all-time, but the three-time player recently announced via social media that he’s officially retired from the game. Since season 50 was announced, Wade has been one of the most requested castaways to appear, and in an Instagram post last March, \"Coach\" explained why he has no desire to return for a fourth time on Survivor. \"What business do I have going on season 50? Why would I need to go back a fourth time? I feel like my legacy has been cemented during three times. So going back on your screen is not really motivation for me. I've got family.\"\nJust three weeks later, Wade reiterated to the Survivor faithful that he is retiring from the competition for good, despite fans begging him to return one last time. It remains to be seen if \"Coach's\" retirement is genuine, or if it's a ruse to keep his Survivor 50 status a secret with filming expected to begin this summer.\nThe 'New Era's' Greatest Villain Gets Rejected From Season 50\nDespite being voted out right before the merge during season 47, Rome Cooney solidified himself as one of the best villains of Survivor's “New Era.” His chaotic gameplay and lack of respect for his fellow castaways not only ruffled feathers with his opponents, but also made him one of the most hated players in recent memory. However, after being voted off last year, fans began to voice their support for Cooney, who they felt deserved a chance at redemption and had entertainment value despite his villainous antics.\nIn addition, Cooney brought a level of arrogance that reminded fans of older generations of Survivor, where contestants would be more open to voicing their opinions about their fellow castaways. Unfortunately, Cooney announced through an Instagram story last March that his hopes of appearing on Survivor 50 were over. \"Welp. Woulda Been Fun.\" Despite the 30-year-old not getting the green light this time around, he'll likely have future opportunities for a second chance due to being a newer player on the show.\nRelated\n‘Survivor 50’ Just Made Its Biggest Mistake\nThe Survivor's landmark season makes a surprising cut.\n'Figgy' Will Not Get a Second Chance\nSince her appearance on Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X in 2016, fans have questioned if Jessica “Figgy” Figueroa would be deserving of another opportunity at the $1 million prize. Although she only lasted 18 days in the game, her on-screen romance with Taylor Stocker was a focal point of the season and became the reason she was voted out sixth in the game, despite having strategic ability. Both contestants dated for a brief period after the show aired, but many fans believe “Figgy” deserves a second chance due to her initial stint on Survivor being focused on her relationship with Stocker rather than gameplay.\nLast month, in a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, Figueroa revealed that she was rejected to be on Survivor 50 and wanted to inform her fans directly that she would not be returning. Although it would be intriguing to watch \"Figgy\" compete without Stocker by her side, being eliminated sixth during Millennials vs. Gen X is likely the reason she wasn't selected for season 50, with many of the chosen castaways expected to be players who made a deep run in the game.\nSurvivor 50 is also set to be in \"The Hands of the Fans,\" with host Jeff Probst allowing the audience at home to vote on rules, props and gameplay ideas for the landmark season. However, as many former contestants continue to be dropped from Survivor 50, fans have become increasingly frustrated with their favorites being left out, making it difficult to get excited about the new twist.\nAdditionally, fan expectations continue to grow for the main cast, which will need to be star-studded in order to appease Survivor's audience at this point, especially due to the legends who've been rejected. That said, Probst often invites back some of the most dramatic contestants to ever play the game for a reason, as there's always the possibility that some former castaways are lying about their Survivor 50 status in order to surprise fans next year.\nSurvivor airs Wednesdays at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT on CBS. All episodes are available to stream on Paramount+.\nSource: InTouch",
