  "text": "A major legal chapter in the ongoing fallout between former Michigan State football coach Mel Tucker and activist Brenda Tracy has come to a close - at least for now. On Monday, Ingham County Judge Wanda Stokes dismissed Tracyâ€™s lawsuit against Tucker, a case that had been simmering since October 2024.\nTracy, a nationally recognized advocate for survivors of sexual abuse, had accused Tucker of attempting to damage her reputation through false and defamatory statements. Specifically, her suit alleged that Tucker falsely claimed she fabricated sexual harassment allegations in a scheme to extort both him and the university.\nThis lawsuit was one of several legal battles stemming from Tuckerâ€™s high-profile firing by Michigan State University in 2023. That dismissal came after a university-led investigation concluded that Tucker had sexually harassed Tracy during a phone call in April 2022 - an incident in which he reportedly masturbated without her consent. Tucker has consistently denied the allegations, asserting that the relationship between him and Tracy was consensual.\nThe university fired Tucker for cause, which meant MSU was not obligated to pay out the roughly $75 million that remained on his contract. Tucker, in turn, is suing the university in federal court, arguing that the firing was improper and that he is still owed that money. That case is still working its way through the legal system.\nIn Mondayâ€™s hearing, Judge Stokes ruled in favor of Tucker, granting his motion to dismiss Tracyâ€™s nine-count lawsuit. According to the ruling, some of Tracy's claims were barred by the statute of limitations, while others lacked sufficient grounds to move forward - meaning there was no factual dispute that would warrant a jury trial.\nThis isnâ€™t the first time a court has ruled against Tracy in this legal saga. A similar lawsuit she filed in 2023 - also against Tucker - was dismissed by the same judge in May 2024.\nThat case centered around text messages between Tracy and her longtime friend and assistant, Ahlan Alvarado, which were made public by Tuckerâ€™s legal team. Alvarado, who passed away after the messages were released, had worked closely with Tracy through her nonprofit, Set The Expectation.\nWhile Tuckerâ€™s attorney, Andrew Abood, expressed a sense of vindication after the ruling, noting that Tucker could now \"put this behind him,\" Tracyâ€™s legal team declined to comment following the hearing. Still, this doesnâ€™t mark the end of the legal entanglements between the two sides.\nAn appeal of the earlier 2023 lawsuit is still pending with the Michigan Court of Appeals. Meanwhile, Tracy has filed a separate federal lawsuit against the MSU Board of Trustees, alleging that members of the board leaked her identity to the media before the investigation was made public.\nAdd to that Tuckerâ€™s own federal lawsuit against the university - filed in July 2024 - and itâ€™s clear that the legal aftershocks from his firing continue to ripple.\nThe universityâ€™s football program, meanwhile, has undergone its own shakeups. After firing Jonathan Smith - who had been hired in November 2023 to replace Tucker - MSU announced on December 1 that it had brought in former Northwestern head coach Pat Fitzgerald to take the reins.\nWhile the courtâ€™s decision this week closes one chapter, the broader story is far from over. With multiple lawsuits still in play and appeals pending, both Tucker and Tracy remain locked in a legal standoff that continues to cast a long shadow over Michigan State football.",
