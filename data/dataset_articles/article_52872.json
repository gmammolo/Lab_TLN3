  "text": "Pizza restaurant Mellow Mushroom announced Wednesday via social media that it will close \"indefinitely\" this Sunday.\nMellow Mushroom began in 1974 in Atlanta, Georgia, and has franchises throughout the country. The locally owned Denton location, at 217 E. Hickory St., opened in 2011 and became a staple restaurant for some folks. The restaurant is part of the Denton Main Street Association.\n\"Any time we see a business close downtown, it's definitely something that we don't like to see,\" association president Kristen Kendrick Bigley said Wednesday. \"But there's many reasons why businesses make that decision.\"\nLocal residents have shared their thoughts on Mellow Mushroom closing and their memories of the restaurant.\nUniversity of North Texas alumnus and sports videographer David Horn said he remembers visiting the restaurant frequently with fellow members of coed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega after service events and meetings.\n\"It was always a good environment,\" Horn said.\nDenton-based vintage clothing vendor Jacob Kerstetter had mixed memories.\n\"The food always kind of took forever,\" Kerstetter said. \"But their food was good, and I'll miss their Caesar salad pizza.\"\nJewelry vendor C. Mikita discovered Mellow Mushroom while vending at the Mosaic Market in 2023. This vendor market was held on the sidewalk outside the restaurant.\n\"Mellow Mushroom holds a very special place in my heart,\" Mikita said. \"Without Mellow Mushroom, I would never have met some of my closest friends.\"\nThe restaurant will close on Sunday, so locals still have time to eat there one last time.",
