  "text": "Steve Austin has confirmed Logan Paul’s claim that he declined a $1 million offer to appear in a PRIME Bottle mascot costume. Paul mentioned the offer on a recent episode of IMPAULSIVE, saying Austin turned it down — and Austin confirmed the story during an appearance on “The Ariel Helwani Show.” For what it’s worth, Austin seemed annoying that Paul revealed the news publicly. He said,\n“If he said that, I’m not going to call him a liar. I just thought it was personal business, but since it’s out there — yeah, I turned it down. I’m in the beer business. I don’t know anything about his product, its ingredients, whether it’s good or bad. It just wasn’t my thing.”\nHe added, “It’s not my gimmick. He’s doing great, he’s hustling, and I respect that. But it just wasn’t the right fit for Steve Austin.”\nDuring a recent appearance on the “Pub Darts” podcast, WWE Superstar Drew McIntyre revealed that he still gets butterflies in his stomach prior to his matches.\nYou can check out some highlights from the interview below:\nOn his confidence when he goes out to perform: “I mean, I do think about it. I’ve done it so long. That as long as I feel confident about the story we’re trying to tell, physically I feel as good as I’m gonna feel. I’m pretty confident when I go out, but I still get the butterflies in my stomach, I still get the nerves.”\nOn still getting butterflies in his stomach before his matches: “No matter if there’s…. WWE, the lowest crowd would be 5,000, whatever, or 80,000 people, 90,000 people in Mania. I get the same butterflies in my stomach, the same thought process, no matter how many people are there. Because I wanna go out there, steal the show. More importantly, to me, is tell a compelling story that we can continue every week.”\nOn telling a compelling storyline: “What matters is not the cool moves we do, its the emotional reaction we get from the crowd. How we make people feel, the moments we give them, that they remember, because they don’t remember a backflip two weeks later. They remember how we made them feel.”\nNOTE: If you have any news tips or podcast recaps that you’d like to send in for us to post (full credit will be given to you), please email me at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f6a4b59a97849da6a1a5b6af979e9999d895999b).",
