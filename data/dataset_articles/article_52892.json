  "text": "Laura Harrier and fiancé Sam Jarou have called it quits after four years together, Us Weekly can exclusively confirm.\n“It’s amicable,” a source tells Us of the split, noting that Harrier, 35, and Jarou have “remained friends” since parting ways.\nThe Spider-Man: Homecoming actress met the French freelance creative consultant in 2019 at a dinner in Los Angeles. They kept their romance under the radar for years, but in September 2022, Harrier star confirmed they were engaged.\n“Yeah. We did get engaged recently, which I’m very excited about,” Harrier told Cosmopolitan at the time.\nRelated: Celebrity Splits of 2025: Stars Who Have Called It Quits This Year\n2025 kicked off with a slew of celebrity breakups. Two months after first sparking split rumors, Jessica Simpson announced that she and Eric Johnson had called it quits after 10 years of marriage. “Eric and I have been living separately navigating a painful situation in our marriage,” she told Us Weekly in a January 13 […]\nShe revealed the proposal was “really simple and sweet in Paris.” Harrier explained, “I never wanted one of those big showy public engagements. That’s just not my personality.”\nWhen asked how she knew she was ready for marriage, Harrier said, “The cliché of ‘when you know, you know.’ I never really believed it until that happened to me. It’s a funny feeling when you just find peace and calm.”\nShe added, “I also really do believe that you need to be ready within yourself before you can find somebody else to be with, which I also always thought was a cliché until I felt secure within myself and the person I am and where I’m at in life.”\nLaura Harrier and Sam Jarou Stephane Cardinale – Corbis/Corbis While Harrier didn’t talk much about her then-fiancé during the interview, she noted that Jarou was “the first man I’ve dated where I’ll actually listen when he gives me outfit advice,” joking that his career in fashion and his thoughts on her clothes felt like a daily “collab.”\nPrior to her split from Jarou, Harrier made headlines in December 2024 when fans thought she was romantically connected to Shameik Moore due to a social media post.\nAt the time, Moore, 29, shared a since-deleted video of him and Harrier from the past with the caption, “Coming soon.” Some fans thought the cute video was a sign that the actors were an item.\nRelated: Celebrity Engagements of 2025: Stars Who Got Engaged\nSeveral stars are taking the next step in their relationship in 2025 by making things official with their significant other. Days after the New Year, Zendaya sparked engagement speculation when she was spotted on the 2025 Golden Globes red carpet with a ring on her left hand. While inside the awards show ceremony on January […]\nHarrier, however, shut down romance speculation with her own since-deleted TikTok video, saying, “I keep seeing all these videos that I’m being tagged in with another actor, and people speculating what that is. It’s really annoying me because I’m literally engaged, and that’s important to me.”\nThe BlacKkKlansman star explained, “I’m in Hollywood, I get it. People do PR stunts, whatever. People like to get attention.”\nHarrier said that once she saw the video, which was taken during a party one year prior, she texted Moore and asked him to take it down, explaining that she didn’t like the “insinuation that something’s going on between us, if that was your intention.”\nMoore, for his part, later deleted the video and posted a public apology to Harrier. “This is all a misunderstanding, unfortunately, it’s public,” he said in a separate video shared via X. “I mean no harm. I have no ill intent. You know it’s about art for me, the video had the aesthetic of the song. That’s it, it wasn’t insinuating a relationship. I apologize for the misunderstanding, I do.”\nThank You!

The couple was going strong until earlier this year, according to Harrier’s social media posts.\nShe last shared a photo with Jarou in January while ringing in the new year on a beach vacation. Harrier posted a cheeky snap of Jarou kissing her on the cheek during a Mexican getaway.\nWhen she did her March Instagram photo dump, Harrier was no longer wearing her engagement ring.\nSource link",
