  "text": "Imagine this: You’ve just launched your dream business. Your products are ready. Your branding looks slick. You hire someone for a cheap website because, hey — “it’s just a website,” right?\nThey promise you the world for $500. Two weeks later, your site is live.\nBut then…\nYour traffic flatlines.\nNo one’s calling.\nCustomers message saying your website “won’t load” or “looks like a scam.” And when you Google your business?
