  "text": "Zooms should be used for artistic purposes, not for utility. If your subject is not in frame or in focus, then you set your scene up badly. Zooms look weird and unnatural, which works great when used artistically, but when not it just looks like the director and camera people hosed up and are making rapid corrections.\nWhat really upsets me is that mostly this hasn't been an issue, until around the time The Office became popular. The Office was a documentary-style show, and to capture that aesthetic, much of the camera work is \"bad\" because it's supposed to be unexpected, as though shot by camera men in the area who did not know what was going to happen. But other shows have taken this style and just run with it, made it formulaic even after the \"documentary\" style has been removed. TMZ is a weird example, and probably not one anyone here watches, but I was in jail and so I had to watch a lot of it because inmates fuckin love TMZ. In a TMZ scene, every single shot, every single shot is \"cut to different camera, wait one second, quickly zoom in on subject\", and then on to a different camera, wait one second, zoom. Different camera, wait one second, zoom. It's loving awful. Brooklyn Nine-Nine does this, too, though it's not quite as egregious and while I think they do it to try and capture the \"unexpectedness\" of the show, it isn't a documentary and so this just looks like bad camera work . Movies now do this, lots of shows do it. It's loving terrible. We've gone from \"the camera is shaky all the time because we're right in the action \" to \"the shot is terribly set up and poorly edited because we're right in the action \"",
