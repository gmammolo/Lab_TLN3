  "text": "Summary\n- Codemasters ends development for EA Sports WRC, and no future rally games are planned.\n- The EA subsidiary's limited-time WRC license continues until 2027.\nThe team behind EA Sports WRC, Codemasters, has announced its decision to end the game's development, with no new content planned beyond the 2024 season. This revelation comes just over a month after the roll-out of EA Sports WRC's second DLC of 2025, the Hard Chargers Content Pack.\nSince being established in 2001, the World Rally Championship or WRC series of rally racing titles has produced over a dozen mainline entries along with some spin-offs. Throughout its existence, the license for the franchise has also switched hands multiple times, with its latest owner—Codemasters—securing the rights back in 2020. After the British studio's takeover by EA in 2021, the devs finally put the IP to use and released EA Sports WRC in 2023 to a positive reception. Since then, multiple expansions of the game, including a major one titled EA Sports WRC 24, have come out. However, most recently, the Codemasters team surprised fans by communicating an end to the game's content cadence, with no promise of reviving the same in the future.\nRelated\n7 Forgotten Electronic Arts Franchises\nEA is notorious for sitting on franchises, leaving a once-popular series dormant for far too long, where only nostalgia remains for some players.\nCodemasters revealed that there will be no further updates for EA Sports WRC after the Hard Chargers Content Pack, which shipped on March 25. Going one step further, the devs also shared their decision to halt the development of future rally games by the team. Giving reassurance to EA Sports WRC players, they confirmed that the game will continue to be available for new and existing users. Furthermore, the racing game veteran Codemasters reflected on its partnership with WRC and labeled it as the \"culmination of sorts\" for its storied legacy in this genre.\nEA Sports WRC Devs to End Development, Take a Break from Rallying Games\nWhile Codemasters abruptly announcing its decision to stop working on EA Sports WRC might seem unusual, it could also be seen as in keeping with the uncertainty surrounding EA-owned studios right now. Case in point, Respawn Entertainment—the Star Wars Jedi studio—was recently reported to have conducted layoffs, affecting 100 employees, in the aftermath of multiple project cancellations.\nEven if Codemasters no longer makes new EA Sports WRC content, its limited-time license, which is in place till 2027, still continues to elapse. With that in mind, it will be interesting to see how long the EA subsidiary's WRC rally racing IP keeps gathering dust before it is used again or is passed on to someone else.\nYour comment has not been saved\nEA Sports WRC\n-\nOpenCritic Reviews - Top Critic Avg: 79/100 Critics Rec: 76%\n- Released\n- 2023-11-31\n- ESRB\n- e\n- Developer(s)\n-\nCodemasters - Publisher(s)\n- Electronic Arts\n- Engine\n- Unreal Engine 5\nBuild the car of your dreams in our biggest rally game ever, EA SPORTS™ WRC, the official videogame of the FIA World Rally Championship, the first developed by the award-winning team behind the DiRT Rally series.\nMAKE YOUR OWN: Design and drive your dream rally car with the debut of Builder mode.\nREWRITE HEADLINES: Get behind the wheel and overcome recent events alongside real-world highlights and nostalgic throwbacks in Moments mode.\nDYNAMIC HANDLING SYSTEM: Codemasters’ renowned multi-surface handling model is improved for WRC.
