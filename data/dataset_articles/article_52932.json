Instead, return it to your nearest store for a refund.”\nIssuing an apology, Asda said: “If you have purchased Asda hot and spicy chicken breast slices with a use by date of the 30 May, please bring it back to your nearest store where you will be given a full refund. You do not need your receipt.\n“We are very sorry for any inconvenience caused.”\nThe food safety watchdog issues recall notices to flag problems with food product that mean they should not be sold and to inform consumers and local authorities of this.\nIt added: “Point of sale notices will be displayed in all retail stores that are selling this product. These notices explain to customers why the product is being recalled and tell them what to do if they have bought the product.”\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments",
