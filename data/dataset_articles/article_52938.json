  "text": "Pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 went live in the United States last week, and it was about as messy as you might have expected. Despite outrage surrounding the Switch 2’s price and the fact that Nintendo has raised the cost of some of its games to $80, pre-orders still sold out instantly. I was lucky enough to be able to snag one (shoutout to Walmart, you had my back when the PS5 launched and you had it again, I’ll never forget that).\n“But, Peter,” I hear you writing in the comments, “You were mad about the increased price of Switch 2 games! How can you possibly justify encouraging Nintendo to keep doing what it’s doing by buying its hardware and games anyway?” That’s a reasonable reaction to have, given how vocal many people have been, myself included, about the ever-increasing price of games and gaming hardware. However, I think that response is well-intentioned, albeit a little misguided.\nBeing mad about how much the Switch 2 and its games cost is perfectly valid, but it’s also valid to buy them anyway.\nLet’s Be Clear: This Isn’t My Fault, This Isn’t Your Fault\nHave you ever seen that comic of the peasant saying, “We should improve society somewhat,” and then there’s a guy with a smug grin on his face saying, “Yet you participate in society, curious!”? That comic is how a lot of the conversations I’ve seen online about Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders feel.\nI am irritated that the cost of living has gone up drastically since I’ve become an adult. Every year, I have less and less spending money thanks to things like inflation and rent increases; and now, thanks to the tariffs the U.S. government has placed on foreign goods, prices have increased exponentially in just a few weeks. All of that makes my blood boil, but there’s not a single thing I can do to change that. I wish there was, but there isn’t.\nI have no control over how much video games cost, and, despite the legions of people out there saying to vote with your wallet, things don’t quite work like that in an industry controlled by three console manufacturers. There aren’t a plethora of options when it comes to buying gaming hardware; the only way you can ‘vote’ is to simply abstain from buying them.\nThe reality of the situation is that an unorganized consumer boycott against one of the biggest media companies in the world will simply not work, since the Switch 2 is guaranteed to be a success thanks to the runaway success of the original console.\nThe Full-Price Discount\nAnother unfortunate reality about the Switch 2’s price is that it is subject to change. In the fine print, console manufacturers are very open about the fact that they reserve the right to change console prices at any time. In the past, that meant that consoles would lower in price after a few years. Early adopters understood that they’d be paying premium prices to get their hands on the Switch or PS4 or whatever right at launch and that the price would gradually go down as we got closer to the next generation of consoles.\nNow, however, consoles have only gone up in price. Earlier this month, the PS5 saw a price increase in several markets, meaning that anyone who bought a console at launch actually got a better deal than those looking to pick one up now. As backward as it might sound, buying a Switch 2 at launch might be the best price that Nintendo offers for the console.\nIt’s Okay To Be Mad\nThat infuriates me. I was able to afford a Switch 2 pre-order because of my tax return, which, unexpectedly, covered most of the costs of the console and a copy of Mario Kart World. I am extremely fortunate that things worked out like that for me since, had it not been for my tax return, I would not have been able to afford it. The fact of the matter, however, is that I was able to afford the console and a game, but that’s not the case for everyone.\nI am upset that gaming has started to stray away from its accessibility by outpricing many of the people who rely on it for entertainment. I understand the business decisions that were made by Nintendo and how its pricing reflects those decisions, but I am still allowed to be mad about them.\nIf you want to play Nintendo games, there is no way to vote with your wallet in a way that Nintendo will notice. If playing Nintendo games is important to you, then you either have to pay for a Switch 2 or simply not engage with the company’s games at all. It is perfectly fine to buy a Switch 2 and be mad that it costs as much as it does, and may very well cost more at some point down the line. This is an invitation to be mad and stay mad until we see economic change, but this is also an invitation to play some video games in the meantime, even if they’re overpriced.\nNintendo Switch 2\n- Brand\n- Nintendo\n- Operating System\n- Proprietary\n- Storage\n- 256GB internal / MicroSD\n- Resolution\n- 1080p (handheld) / 4K (docked)",
