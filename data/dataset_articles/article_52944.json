He joked she was \"allergic\" to him and called himself\nEntertainment DeskNew Delhi | May 1, 2025 06:02 IST\nFor all we can see, Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco can barely keep their hands off each other. Be it an award show, a red carpet gala, or a casual night out with friends, the two’s PDA-filled outings never miss a headline. But there was also a time when Gomez got a face rash after fiancé\nBlanco kissed her for the first time when they started dating. The I Said I Love You First duo recently appeared on Jessie and Lennie Ware’s Table Manners podcast and didn’t shy away from sharing some juicy details about their earlier encounter, including the embarrassing one.\nAlso read:\n Benny Blanco learns fiancee Selena Gomez never went to prom; he makes it happen for her\nSelena Gomez was so nervous during her first kiss, says Blanco\nOn Wednesday’s episode, the music producer revealed how the two were playing the “We’re Not Really Strangers” card game on their second date. This was back in mid-2023 when they had just started hanging out. They were chilling on the couch, and one of the prompts told them to take a selfie together. Selena leaned on Benny’s chest and snapped the photo, and the moment got a little more cosy than expected, to the point that Blanco just went for it. “I gotta kiss this girl,” he told her. So he did. And according to both of them, it was a really good kiss.\nBut right after the kiss, Selena’s body kinda betrayed her. “I kissed her right away, and her heart started beating so quickly, and she started getting a rash on her face … she was so nervous,” Blanco shared, laughing. Of course, that wasn’t the real reason. But the Table Manners podcast host joked if the singer was allergic to Blanco, and he replied again with, “She was, yeah. I was so disgusting and repulsive,” prompting Selena to hide her face in embarrassment.\nAlso read:\n Selena Gomez joins youngest billionaires club with an estimated net worth of USD 1.3 billion; that’s Rs 11000 crore\nBut, the Love On singer then explained she hadn’t truly liked anyone in a long time, not in that deep, emotional way. “Some kisses are just for fun,” she said. “But when you feel something behind it, it’s completely different.” For the unversed, Selena is quite a private person when it comes to dating, and the singer was not linked to anyone romantically for almost five years before going official with Benny Blanco—minus, as she put it, a few “shty dates here and there.” So when this kiss felt different, she didn’t know how to act. “I was a little embarrassed,” Selena admitted. “He asked, ‘Are you OK?’ And I was like, ‘No, no, I’m fine.’ I didn’t want to say, ‘I like you, I really like you.’”** And despite the awkwardness, according to the duo, that kiss actually kicked off everything.\nFrom that day, things just felt easy between them. They kept dating, and Selena, who Benny called “so insane” about punctuality, would even show up to his house 20 to 30 minutes early for their dates, just to make sure she wasn’t late. “Her car would just be parked outside for like 30 minutes, and she would just wait until it was time to come in,” Blanco shared.\n“I don’t think we’ve ever said that out loud to anyone, but it’s so funny,” Gomez said. “It’s just, I don’t know, I was nervous that I really liked him and I wanted to get there and, like, maybe call a friend to pump me up or do my makeup again or something.”\nBenny and Selena first met in way back in 2013, through Selena’s mom. They later worked together on music like Kill Em With Kindness and “Same Old Love.” But the romance didn’t begin until much later. around mid-2023. They confirmed their relationship in December that year.\nClick for more updates and latest",
