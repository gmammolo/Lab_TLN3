  "text": "The partnership between Electronic Arts and the World Rally Championship (WRC) has been short-lived , lasting only one installment . Codemasters , long associated with rally racing , has officially ceased development on all WRC-related projects, shifting its focus away from the sport.\nFor fans, this is a major loss . Codemasters has been a pillar of rally gaming , and after joining EA, it had a golden opportunity with the official WRC license. Now, with the studio stepping away, rally enthusiasts are left without a clear future for the franchise.\nCodemasters confirms the decision In a brief statement , the team acknowledged the end of its WRC journey:\n“Every great journey eventually finds its finish line, and today, we announce that we’ve reached the end of the road working on WRC. For now, we are pausing development plans on future rally titles. Rest assured, EA SPORTS WRC will continue to be available for existing and new players. We hope it remains a source of joy, excitement, and the thrill of rally racing. We’ve poured our hearts into making it for fans, and we know you’ll keep the passion alive.”\nWhat’s next for WRC and Codemasters? Fans on ResetEra have noticed that Codemasters’ official Twitter account has been deleted , raising concerns about a possible restructuring within the studio.\nThis news follows other recent cancellations from EA, including the rumored Titanfall 3 , which insiders claim was being developed as an extraction shooter .\nThe future of WRC gaming remains uncertain, but the FIA has hinted at an ambitious new direction for the franchise, with more details expected soon.",
