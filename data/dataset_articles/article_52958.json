  "text": "Pasco, WA- Cinco de Mayo is one of Pasco's biggest celebrations of the year, but it's back to one day this year. City leaders tell us budget shortfalls made the move necessary despite last year's two-day event, which has been the expectation in recent years once it was decided that the events would be packed into one day. The work to make it successful began.\n\" A way of moving forward and still providing a wonderful event for the community made sense to cut down to one full day, depending on how budgets and sponsorships and everything go in the future, we might move it back up to two, \" said Brent Kubalek, Pasco Recreation Services Manager.\nAs for what to expect, the Pasco school district will be a big part of what you see from the Mariachi band to dancing, even boxing. A lot of the performances will feature students with the Grand Marshal this year, a tenth-grade student, Robert Gomez.\nThe tenth grader is the Boys and Girls Club Youth of the Year. The goal is to show off and celebrate Mexican culture in Pasco.\n\" Great source of pride for my students, to be able to embrace their Mexican roots. Most of them are Mexican, Spanish-speaking ones, and it's a wonderful way for them to connect with their families and their heritage,\" said Allen Madsen, the Marachi instructor at Chiawana High School.\nThe festival kicks off this Saturday at ten in the morning with the parade at Volunteer Park. Here is the full schedule of Saturday's event link.",
