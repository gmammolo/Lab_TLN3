  "text": "Sunday\nI bought Google Chromecast HD S almost 4 monts ago. Everything worked fine until few weeks back. Now, when I stream from my desktop to my LG smart TV, I have a problem with glitches. It works fine for a while and than it just keep freezing i.e. sound on picture freeze. Tried all the troubleshooting suggestions I could find, but no help. Any suggestions? It's still under a warranty and I am not sure should I return it to the shop or it is something Google messed up?\n7m ago\nHi @Midža,\nThanks for reaching out to the community page.
