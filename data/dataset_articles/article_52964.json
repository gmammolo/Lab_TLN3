  "text": "Sunday\n3aw Melbourne Radioapp not working on my Google Nest. Just happened in the last few days. Ok for other stations I have tried. Any ideas?\nMonday\nHello, I can get Fox fm on one of my 4 devices either down here in Melbourne.\nMonday\nMy Google Nest automatically uses RadioApp for all stations, yet I can stream music as requested from other sources as per the settings, for example, Spotify.\nMonday\nEDIT: Can't*\nMonday\nSame here in Woy Woy the last two days. I reset the device to no avail. Very annoying. All stations. The problem seems to be the App. itself\nMonday\nSame issue started yesterday unable to stream a number of Melbourne radio stations can only get random stations. Can’t work out how to fix it, Very annoying!\nMonday\nWe have foxfm set to start playing on a\narm currently getting nothing. Radio app please review and fix the issue.\n14 hours ago\nI have the same issue. Not working on 6pr or 3aw which makes me thing it’s to do with nine as they are owned by them.\n13 hours ago\nNot for me, all stations, Smooth, 2GB, interstate etc. The Radio app is also faulty on my Google Pixel. The problem was once again raised on 2GB this am, not good enough. My Amazon streaming units are fine. My Google Nest software has been checked and is current. It is time to call in people like Stephen Fenech or Charlie Brown for comment.\nI was contemplating purchasing a new Google Pixel, now I have second thoughts.\n14 hours ago\nAny thoughts on how to get radioapps attention?\n14 hours ago\nHave no idea. I can get all other stations just not those 2\n13 hours ago\njust sent them a message on radio app. Hopefully it gets resolved\nan hour ago\nI emailed the Radio App people ( An Australian outfit ) 4 days ago, so far as of today, May 1, not even the courtesy of a response.\n18m ago\nI've emailed as well, no reply or fixes yet either! Hopefully something get resolved soon!",
