  "text": "Summary\n- Call of Duty: Warzone players point out that exterior ascenders and vertical ziplines were not mentioned in the latest update for Verdansk in Season 3 Reloaded.\n- Some players are doubtful that the features will be added to Verdansk with the update on May 1.\n- Exterior ascenders and vertical ziplines were originally promised to come to Verdansk after the launch of Season 3 and before the Season 3 Reloaded update.\nCall of Duty: Warzone players have noticed that Season 3 Reloaded's Verdansk is missing rooftop ziplines and exterior ascenders that were available during Season 5 of the original Warzone. Ahead of the Season 3 Reloaded launch, many Call of Duty: Warzone players expected the ziplines and ascenders to be present, making traversal more streamlined on the map.\nOn April 2, the Call of Duty: Warzone Season 3 update brought a rebuilt version of Verdansk with new light adjustments, quality-of-life improvements, and features that are faithful, including Buy Stations, Points of Interest, Killstreaks, and Easter eggs. Elements from the original Warzone's later seasons were added as well, such as Metro Station entrances and other map changes. What's more, the Call of Duty: Warzone Season 3 update brought multiple modes, including 150-player Battle Royale and the new Battle Royale Casual mode, which supports up to 120 bots and 28 real players. On May 1, the Season 3 Reloaded update will bring some updates to the Verdansk map to bring it up to speed with the original iteration of the map.\nRelated\n'Never Gonna Beat This' Call of Duty: Warzone Player Pulls Off Ridiculous RPG Shot\nA Call of Duty: Warzone player is considering retiring their RPG after making a once-in-a-lifetime shot that stunned the community.\nAs pointed out by ModernWarzone on Twitter, the official Call of Duty: Warzone Season 3 Reloaded blog post did not mention exterior ascenders or vertical ziplines, implying that these features will not be available on the map when the mid-season update launches on May 1. Only interior ascenders were included, which means players can reach the top of a building by heading inside it. Near the start of Call of Duty: Warzone Season 3, the developers at Raven Software promised that exterior ascenders would be added sometime between launch and the mid-season update, and the lack of new information has players doubtful about the feature's inclusion.\nCall of Duty: Warzone Players Point Out that Verdansk is Still Missing Exterior Ascenders and Vertical Ziplines\nThis discovery has some players worried about Verdansk in Season 3 Reloaded, since exterior ascenders and vertical ziplines were available in the original Warzone. However, it has sparked some debates among players in the community on Twitter, since many fans are happy with the gameplay and pacing of the matches on Verdansk in Call of Duty: Warzone Season 3. Others are arguing that rooftop camping has become more common in Season 3, resulting in players wanting ascenders and ziplines to be added sooner rather than later.\nIn Season 3 Reloaded, the Verdansk Train Station will be open with multiple access points. Warzone players can also expect High Value Loot Zones and more contracts, including the Big Game Bounty Contract and Train Recon Contract. Rebirth Island's Triumph TF 250-X motorbike will also be added to Verdansk with the new update.\nYour comment has not been saved\nCall of Duty: Warzone\n-\nOpenCritic Reviews - Top Critic Avg: 80/100 Critics Rec: 78%\n- Released\n- March 10, 2020\n- ESRB\n- M for Mature: Blood and Gore, Strong Language, Suggestive Themes, Use of Drugs, Violence\n- Developer(s)\n-\nInfinity Ward,Raven Software - Publisher(s)\n-\nActivision - Engine\n- IW 8.0 & IW 9.0 (Warzone 2.0)",
