  "text": "Living\nWhy Commuters Are ‘Barebacking’ Their Train Rides-and Freaking Everyone Out\nThey're calling it \"barebacking,\" and no, it's not what you think. This new trend has nothing to do with dating apps and everything to do with the daily grind.\nAs return-to-office mandates ramp back up, a growing number of commuters are ditching their phones, books, and laptops during their train or bus rides. Instead, they're just… staring. Out the window. Into space. Occasionally into the eyes of fellow passengers, much to their discomfort.\nThis unnerving behavior has a name thanks to talent manager and podcaster Curtis Morton, who recently went viral for calling out so-called \"barebackers\" who zone out during commutes. But\nFortune reports that experts say this idle behavior might not be laziness-or even boredom. It's rebellion.\nCareer coaches and psychotherapists alike are framing this screen-free silence as a conscious way for workers to reclaim their time. \"It's a pushback against the erosion of boundaries,\" says career coach Amanda Augustine. Instead of jumping into emails before their first sip of coffee, employees are creating mental buffers between their personal and professional lives. It's less defiance, more survival.\nRelated: Returning to Office Comes at a Much Higher Cost Post-Pandemic\nAnd science is on their side. Staring out the window isn't just oddly meditative-it reduces stress, fights screen fatigue, and boosts productivity through diffuse-mode thinking, the kind of creative processing that happens when your brain is at rest.\nStill, not everyone's a fan. The awkward eye contact and eerie silence make for a tense ride. But according to experts, that moment of nothingness may be exactly what our brains need to fire on all cylinders later.\nSo the next time someone on your train seems to be zoning out, maybe give them a break. They might just be doing some of their best work-with their eyes closed.\n2025 The Arena Group Holdings, Inc. All rights reserved.\nThis story was originally published April 30, 2025 at 8:36 PM.",
