  "text": "The relationship between North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick and his 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson has been the talk of the town lately.\nThe topic has gotten so large that even ESPN’s Paul Finebaum jumped in and threw some criticism toward the couple, calling out Hudson big-time.\n “The bottom line, it’s pretty simple to understand,” Finebaum said. “Belichick’s trying to help her, trying to get her jobs, and she doesn’t seem to be qualified to do anything but get in the way.”\nThe comments came in reference to a recent CBS interview with Belichick, when Hudson jumped into the conversation to shut down any questions related to the start of their relationship together.\n“I agreed to speak with CBS Sunday Morning to promote my new book, ‘The Art of Winning – Lessons from My Life in Football,’” Belichick said in a statement. “Prior to this interview, I clearly communicated with my publicist at Simon & Schuster that any promotional interviews I participated in would agree to focus solely on the contents of this book.”\nBelichick continued, saying that the interview drifted away from the book and that the agreement “was not honored during the interview.”\n“When we agreed to speak to Mr. Belichick, it was for a wide-ranging interview,” CBS said, responding to the accusation . “There were no preconditions or limitations to this conversation. This was confirmed repeatedly with his publisher before the interview took place and after it was completed.”\nAs Hudson and Belichick continue to make headlines, the story is sure to continue with more juicy details about the relationship with a more than 50-year age gap.",
