  "text": "To make way for the expansion of Avengers Campus and a possible new bathroom facility, the guest walkway leading to the area from Cars Land has now been closed.\nWalkway Closed Between Avengers Campus and Cars Land\nAs we reported last week, the walkway connecting Avengers Campus to Cars Land on the side of Disney California Adventure has now been closed.\nThe path in question has one entrance on the right side of Cars Land between Radiator Springs Curios and Luigi’s Rollickin’ Roadsters. The opposite end of the walkway placed guests in the back corner of Avengers Campus, between the Ancient Sanctum and the Avengers Vault store. The Ancient Sanctum used to be the home of the “Dr. Strange: Mysteries of the Mystic Arts” show before it was cut last year.\nBoth sides of the path are now blocked completely with construction walls. The walls are painted differently on either side to match the theming of the respective lands. The walls on the Avengers Campus side of the walkway are bright blue.\nThe edges of the walls are lined with additional green tarps to prevent guests from slipping around the corner.\nThe closure of this walkway is temporary due to construction work, but it is not expected to reopen until sometime next summer.\nOn the opposite side of the walkway, the path in Cars Land has also been blocked with construction walls. These are painted a bright brown color to match the fence on the left.\nUnlike the walls in Avengers Campus, the Cars Land walls extend all the way around the back of the gardens. None of the work taking place around the walkway will be visible to guests as a result.\nWith this walkway closed, guests wanting to reach Avengers Campus from Cars Land will need to head back down the main walkway to the edge of Pacific Warf and take the larger path on the right into the campus.\nDisney has announced a planned expansion of Avengers Campus in Disney California Adventure that is expected to double the size of the land as part of the wider DisneylandForward expansion project. Avengers Campus will receive two new attractions called Avengers: Infinity Defense and Stark Flight Lab. This guest walkway is also rumored to rumored to receive a new bathroom facility, though Disney has not confirmed it yet.\nWhat do you think of the Avengers Campus expansion project? Let us know in the comments.\nFor more Disneyland Resort news and info, follow Disneyland News Today on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. For Disney Parks news worldwide, visit WDWNT.",
