  "text": "Woman’s Fiancé Moved In And Instantly Shared His Dislike For Her Indoor Cat, But When He Let It Out Of The House On Purpose, She Wasn’t Letting It Go\nImagine being a cat person and then getting engaged only to find out your fiancé is not a cat person.\nNot only is this woman’s fiancé not a cat person, he also lets her daughter’s indoor cat out of the house on purpose, hoping it will get lost.\nNaturally, she was mad about it, but now she’s second-guessing her reaction.\nLet’s analyze the situation.\nAITA for blowing up on my fiancé in front of his family for getting my daughter’s cat out of the house?\nI (f, 35) got engaged to my fiancé Eric (m, 37) 2 months ago.\nHe moved in with me and my daughter Zoey (f, 13).\nEverything was going well until he started complaining about Zoey’s cat.\nThis is strange because the cat is so sweet and quiet most of the time and so I had no idea what the issue was exactly.\nThings escalated.\nAnyways, he went from complaining about the cat to making demands about her.\nHe gave Zoey a list of places the cat can/can’t go, things she’s “allowed” to touch, banned her from places like the kitchen and sofa (Zoey’s favorite place to cuddle with her cat).\nZoey showed me this list and I had an argument with him.\nBut this was to no avail, even though it was their house first.\nI told him he needed to stop this because it was ridiculous.\nHe ranted about this being his house too now and how he expects things to change after we get married.\nFew days ago, I was at work and got a call from Zoey crying, saying her cat wasn’t in her room and in the house.\nI freaked out too and went home to look for her.\nZoey and I looked for 2 hours before a neighbor of ours brought her and told us that he saw Eric leaving her outside and getting in his car and leaving.\nThings quickly reached a boiling point after that.\nI was surprised and quite angry.\nZoey took her cat and went back inside.\nI immediately drove to my future in-laws’ home where Eric said he’d be.\nThe second I saw him sitting with his family I went off and blew up at him in front of everyone.\nHis mom asked what was happening and I told her that her son got my daughter’s INDOOR cat outside the house, probably hoping for her to get lost.\nThat was cruel and sneaky. But he still insisted he was right.\nHe argued about wanting me to stop spouting “nonsense” and go home and we’d talk there, but I refused.\nIt got worse and I ended up leaving after his family flipped out at him.\nHe sent a bunch of texts talking about “the stunt” I pulled in front of his family.\nHe denied it, but she had a way to verify it.\nHe said that he didn’t mean to leave the cat out, but after checking the cams I confirmed it.\nHe still insisted that I humiliated him in front of his family and tried to turn them against him.\nHe’s been staying with a friend and has stopped calling and texting.\nAITA?\nHe clearly doesn’t like cats and at some point will make her choose between him and the cat.\nChoose the cat!\nLet’s see what Reddit has to say about this situation.\nA reader shares their thoughts.\nYup.\nThis commenter sounds baffled.\nSimple like that.\nAnother reader chimes in.\nI agree.\nIt’s the cat’s home first, her and her daughter’s home second…\nAnd now it will never be that guy’s home.\nIf you enjoyed that story, read this one about a mom who was forced to bring her three kids with her to apply for government benefits, but ended up getting the job of her dreams.\nSign up to get our BEST stories of the week straight to your inbox.",
