  "text": "CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas — If you've noticed the cost of your favorite cup of joe has gone up, you're not alone.\n\"I will say the cost of coffee has definitely been going up over the last couple of years,\" said Adolphos Coffee Roasters owner Keenan Laymon.\nHe also adds that with the cost constantly on the rise for coffee beans, profit margins have decreased drastically.\n\"If you were selling the same coffee that we're selling, 10 or 15 years ago, in order to make the same profit margins, we would have to sell a small latte -- like this big -- for about $12 or $15,\" Laymon said. \"And right now we sell it for about $5.\"\nSimilar heat and drought conditions to the ones we see here in South Texas are also impacting the coffee-bean industry globally.\n\"Say, you specifically, want a Brazilian coffee,\" Laymon said. \"We might not be able to offer it because they've had a drought, and what we're getting from Brazil might not be the highest quality.\"\nBaristas say the location of where your coffee and espresso beans come from mean everything in the sense of quality over quantity.\n\"When one country is out of season or going through a drought, what we get from them isn't necessarily the best quality,\" Laymon said. \"We just pivot and shift to a different country, typically.\"\nBecause customer satisfaction means everything.\n\"A lot of places get it too bitter, too sour, a little burnt, whatever,\" said customer Ben Botsford. \"Adelpho's always does a really good job.\"\nClose Ad",
