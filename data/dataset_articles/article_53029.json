  "text": "The Pokemon TCG is experiencing another wave of mark-up fever as resellers snap up new expansion releases at MSRP, only to throw them on eBay and other online marketplaces for substantially more than the original price. While this isn’t unexpected for websites like Facebook Marketplace, fans have recently found marked-up products on Target’s online store, and with no clear indication that a third-party seller is involved. Recent Pokemon TCG sets like Surging Sparks and Prismatic Evolutions have seen some of the worst reseller shortages since the Sword and Shield era of the TCG. Due to low product supply, extreme hype over certain cards, and general fear of missing out, singles from both sets have soared in value, while unopened products have been gouged to as much as triple the original price. The primary way to avoid resellers in the Pokemon TCG market is to purchase sets from big box stores. This has made Walmart, Target, and GameStop of the most important retailers for fans of the game. However, players have recently spotted something strange with Target listings of various TCG sets, leading to a backlash from loyal customers. As shared in a social media post by DisTrackers , players have seen listings showing Pokemon TCG products at eye-watering prices. This includes the Prismatic Evolutions Poster Collection listed at $40, when it typically retails at $14.99. This can be seen on Best Buy’s sold-out listing . In the listing for the Poster Collection on Target , the retailer has been called out by shoppers furious with the lack of transparency. The set is not available to pick up or have delivered from a store. However, nowhere on the listing does Target clearly state that the product is coming from a third-party seller, despite the gouged prices. Typically, Target gets its product directly from Pokemon suppliers, and until recently, reseller costs had never been listed on the website. In the comments, one shopper replied, “I just looked up the MSRP. It’s 15 dollars. This is 40. That’s nuts,” while another added, “Ridiculous retail is marking up from msrp.” The most frustrating thing about the markups for many is not knowing where Target is sourcing the cards from. Those who don’t know that the sets are marked up are at risk of purchasing a third-party item without knowing it, or understanding that the set has been marked up well above the normal price. One commenter pointed this out, stating, “Like others I almost got scammed myself by buying 3 of these. No wonder it lets me checkout as Target online usually don’t let me do that anymore as my items get snatched from the cart by bots when checking out. After paying I noticed the total was over $120! Canceled my order right away. Unacceptable for Target to scalp like this. This product retails for $15 and Target trying to sell it for $40!” Unfortunately, the Prismatic Evolutions Poster Collection isn’t the only item marked up beyond MSRP. The Prismatic Evolutions Art Bundle, which only shows pictures of generic booster packs, is marked at $80, and the Prismatic Evolutions Mini Tin display, which contains eight tins, is a glass-shattering $265. These tins typically retail at $10 each, making the set worth only $80 total. This breach in Pokemon TCG player trust is likely to have long-term impacts on Target, especially at a time when many have been boycotting the store for other reasons. Hopefully, the reseller prices will be removed, so players can continue to access the products at a fair price.
