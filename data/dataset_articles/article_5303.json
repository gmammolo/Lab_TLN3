  "text": "Green light for the Chamber's Constitutional Affairs Committee on the proposed law on the regulation of lobbies . The sense of the new discipline is to regulate and give transparency to the activity carried out by interest representatives as a contribution to public decisions, but always 'in compliance with the regulations in force, respecting the autonomy of the institutions and with an obligation of loyalty and integrity towards them'. Public Register A public register for the transparency of lobbyists' activities is to be set up at the Cnel. A single register in which those already existing at other institutions will also be merged (at the Chamber - for example - there is the one created during the Fico presidency). A Supervisory Committee will also be set up at the CNEL to monitor registrations and impose sanctions ranging from fines to cancellation.",
