  "text": "Evil Dead: The Game is no longer available for purchase for PC, as the\nPvPvE multiplayer game based on the Evil Dead movies and shows is no longer for\nsale on\nSteam, while its Epic\nGames Store Listing is just gone without a trace. Its Epic launch came\nless than three years ago and it\narrived on Steam\nbarely two\nyears ago as a Game of the Year Edition (showing how quickly pride can turn\nto shame). Development on the game\nended\nin 2023, and it seems logical that this news is because a licensing deal\nexpired. And though no longer sold, the game can still be played by those who\nown it already, so it's surprising it was pulled with no advance notice from\nSaber Interactive. A\nterse update offers thanks to players, including \"those who have recently\njoined us,\" while offering no apologies or refunds:\nWe can confirm we've begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts. Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone.\nWe want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support.",
