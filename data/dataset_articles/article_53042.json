  "text": "Author of Convenience Store Woman returns with a nightmare world where sex between married couples is taboo\nVanishing World is another quirky novel by Japanese writer Sayaka Murata, where ‘relationships’ with anime or manga characters is commonplace and children are raised without their biological family\nSayaka Murata is the Japanese novelist who made her name here with Convenience Store Woman. The novel follows shop-worker Keiko, who challenges societal norms by showing no interest in having a relationship or moving to a different job.\nHer character was isolated by society for not wanting to have a husband or start a family. Muraka herself worked in a convenience store, and didn’t start writing until she was in her forties. The short novel, her 10th book and first to be translated, was wacky, introspective and, as is Muraka’s style, beautifully descriptive.\nHave you tried Focail and Conundrum?\nDaily word puzzles designed to test your vocabulary and lateral thinking skills.",
