  "text": "Are SPS Corals Hard to Keep? A Reef Keeper’s Candid Guide The short answer? Yes, generally, SPS (Small Polyp Stony) corals are considered challenging to keep in a reef aquarium. However, like any endeavor in the reefing world, it’s a matter of perspective, preparation, and perseverance. While some species are notoriously finicky, others are more forgiving. Success with SPS hinges on understanding their specific needs and maintaining a stable, pristine environment. This guide will delve into the nuances of keeping these captivating corals, equipping you with the knowledge to decide if they’re right for your reefing journey.\nUnderstanding the SPS Challenge SPS corals, the architects of breathtaking coral reefs, are undeniably beautiful. Their vibrant colors and intricate branching structures add unmatched beauty to any tank. But this beauty comes at a price: the price of dedication and meticulous attention to detail.\nThe primary reason SPS corals are challenging stems from their sensitivity to water parameters . They demand near-perfect conditions to thrive, far more so than soft corals or even many LPS (Large Polyp Stony) corals. Fluctuations in alkalinity, calcium, magnesium, temperature, and salinity can quickly lead to stress, bleaching, and even death.\nFurthermore, SPS corals are very particular about lighting and water flow . They need intense, full-spectrum light to fuel their symbiotic zooxanthellae algae. Strong, turbulent water flow is essential for delivering nutrients, removing waste, and preventing detritus buildup.\nAggression from neighboring corals is another concern. Many LPS corals possess potent stinging capabilities, and SPS corals are often vulnerable to these attacks. Careful placement and consideration of each coral’s “personality” are essential for a harmonious reef environment.\nFactors Influencing SPS Success Several factors contribute to the success (or failure) of keeping SPS corals:\nWater Quality: This is paramount. Maintaining stable alkalinity (around 8-11 dKH), calcium (400-450 ppm), magnesium (1250-1350 ppm), and near-zero nitrates and phosphates is crucial. Regular testing and appropriate supplementation are non-negotiable. Lighting: SPS corals need intense light, typically provided by metal halides, T5 fluorescent bulbs, or high-quality LEDs. The specific type and intensity will depend on the species of SPS you’re keeping. Water Flow: Strong, turbulent flow is essential for nutrient delivery and waste removal. Powerheads and wavemakers are your allies here. Stability: Consistency is key. Minimize fluctuations in water parameters, temperature, and salinity. Equipment: A reliable protein skimmer, refugium, or other nutrient control methods are essential. A quality controller to monitor and automate parameters is also highly recommended. Acclimation: Properly acclimating new SPS corals to your tank is vital. Drip acclimation is generally the preferred method. Observation: Regularly observing your corals for signs of stress (e.g., loss of color, tissue recession) is crucial for early intervention. Patience: A successful reef tank is not built overnight. It takes time for the ecosystem to mature and stabilize. Beginner-Friendly SPS Corals While many SPS corals are best left to experienced reef keepers, some are more tolerant and suitable for beginners who are committed to maintaining optimal conditions:\nMontipora: Certain species of Montipora, such as Montipora digitata and Montipora capricornis, are relatively hardy and fast-growing. Seriatopora: Birdsnest corals (Seriatopora hystrix) are another good option for beginners. Stylophora: Similar to Seriatopora, Stylophora corals are relatively easy to care for. Pocillopora: This coral is considered an excellent choice for beginners. These corals are more forgiving of minor fluctuations in water parameters and can provide a good introduction to SPS keeping. However, even these “easy” SPS corals require diligent care and attention.\nAdvanced SPS Corals Acropora, beautiful corals that come in nearly any color imaginable, are the most demanding species, including Acropora millepora and Acropora tenuis. They are extremely sensitive to changes in water parameters. They require very stable conditions and are best left to experienced reef keepers.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some frequently asked questions to further illuminate the world of SPS corals:\n1. What exactly does “SPS” stand for? SPS stands for Small Polyp Stony . The “S” can also stand for Scleractinian. These corals are characterized by their small polyps and stony, calcium carbonate skeletons.\n2. How often should I test my water parameters? Ideally, you should test your water parameters at least once a week . More frequent testing (e.g., every other day) is recommended when initially setting up your tank or after making any significant changes.\n3. What type of lighting is best for SPS corals? There’s no single “best” type of lighting. Metal halides, T5 fluorescent bulbs, and high-quality LEDs can all be used successfully. The key is to provide sufficient intensity and a full spectrum of light. LED fixtures are becoming increasingly popular due to their energy efficiency, controllability, and longevity.\n4. How important is water flow for SPS corals? Water flow is crucial . It delivers nutrients, removes waste, prevents detritus buildup, and helps maintain oxygen levels. Aim for turbulent, random flow throughout your tank.\n5. What are some common signs of stress in SPS corals? Common signs of stress include loss of color (bleaching), tissue recession, and a dull, lifeless appearance.\n6. What causes SPS corals to turn brown? SPS corals can turn brown due to elevated phosphate and/or nitrates in the water and/or insufficient lighting . These factors increase the density of zooxanthellae, resulting in a brownish hue.\n7. Do SPS corals need to be fed? Yes, SPS corals benefit from feeding. They can absorb nutrients directly from the water, but supplemental feeding with small particle foods can enhance their growth and coloration.\n8. What’s the best food for SPS corals? Small particle foods such as Oyster-Feast™ and R.O.E. Real Oceanic Eggs™ are excellent choices. You can also use powdered coral foods or phytoplankton.\n9. Can I mix LPS and SPS corals in the same tank? Yes, but with careful planning . LPS corals typically require lower lighting and water flow than SPS corals, so you may need to create separate zones in your tank to accommodate both types of corals. Some LPS corals are also aggressive and can sting SPS corals, so be mindful of placement.\n10. Are SPS corals aggressive? SPS corals are generally less aggressive compared to many LPS corals. However, some species can still sting or shade their neighbors.\n11. How do I acclimate new SPS corals to my tank? Drip acclimation is the preferred method. Slowly drip water from your tank into the bag containing the coral over a period of several hours. This allows the coral to gradually adjust to your tank’s water parameters.\n12. What’s the ideal salinity for an SPS reef tank? The ideal salinity is around 1.025-1.026 specific gravity (35 ppt) .\n13. Should I add fish or corals first to a new tank? It’s generally recommended to cycle your tank with fish first , then wait several weeks (or even months) before adding corals, especially sensitive SPS corals. This allows the biological filter to mature and stabilize.\n14. How long should I wait before adding SPS corals to a new tank? You often hear that you should wait 4 to 6 months and sometimes up to a year before adding sensitive SPS corals to a tank.\n15. Where should SPS corals be placed in a tank? SPS corals must go at the top and LPS corals in the middle range and bottom.\nThe Final Verdict Keeping SPS corals is undoubtedly a challenge, but it’s also incredibly rewarding. With diligent research, proper equipment, and unwavering commitment to maintaining pristine water quality, you can create a thriving SPS reef tank that will be the envy of every reef keeper.\nRemember to educate yourself further on the complexities of reef ecosystems, with resources like The Environmental Literacy Council at enviroliteracy.org , which helps promote understanding of environmental issues. Embrace the challenge, and you’ll be rewarded with the unparalleled beauty of SPS corals.",
