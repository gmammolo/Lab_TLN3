  "text": "Is 90 Degrees Too Hot for Hermit Crabs? A Comprehensive Guide Yes, 90 degrees Fahrenheit is generally too hot for hermit crabs . While these creatures hail from tropical environments, prolonged exposure to temperatures that high can lead to heat stress , dehydration, and even death. Maintaining a stable and appropriate temperature range is crucial for their well-being.\nUnderstanding Hermit Crab Temperature Requirements Hermit crabs thrive in a specific temperature range that mimics their natural habitat. Understanding these requirements is the first step in providing proper care.\nIdeal Temperature: The optimal temperature range for most common hermit crab species is 72-84 degrees Fahrenheit (22-29 degrees Celsius) . Purple Pincher (PPs): As indicated, Purple Pincher hermit crabs (Coenobita clypeatus) can tolerate slightly cooler temperatures, with a minimum of around 75 degrees Fahrenheit . Temperature Gradient: It’s beneficial to create a temperature gradient within the crabitat, allowing the crabs to move to warmer or cooler areas as needed. This can be achieved using an under-tank heater (UTH) placed on one side of the tank. The Dangers of Overheating When the temperature exceeds the recommended range, hermit crabs can suffer serious consequences. Recognizing the signs of overheating is vital.\nHeat Stress: High temperatures cause stress, making crabs more susceptible to illness and impacting their molting process. Dehydration: Hermit crabs rely on humidity to keep their gills moist. Excessive heat can lead to rapid dehydration, compromising their ability to breathe. Signs of Overheating: Watch out for these warning signs: Lethargy: Reduced activity and a general lack of energy. Hanging out of the shell: A desperate attempt to cool down. Foaming at the mouth: Indicates severe distress and potential gill damage. Leaking brown liquid: A sign of severe overheating and internal damage. Maintaining the Right Temperature Several factors contribute to keeping your hermit crab tank at the correct temperature.\nUnder-Tank Heater (UTH): A UTH is the most common and effective way to heat a crabitat. Choose a size appropriate for your tank and place it on one side to create a temperature gradient. Thermostat: Use a thermostat to regulate the UTH and prevent overheating. This is particularly important in areas with fluctuating ambient temperatures. The thermostat probe should be placed inside the tank, near the center, to monitor the temperature accurately. Thermometer: Use a reliable thermometer to monitor the temperature inside the tank. Place the thermometer in the middle of the tank, away from the heat source, to get an accurate reading. Ventilation: Proper ventilation is essential to prevent the buildup of excessive heat and humidity. A mesh lid is ideal for allowing airflow while maintaining security. Ambient Temperature: Be mindful of the room temperature. A crabitat in a hot room will require more cooling measures than one in a cooler environment. Cooling Down an Overheated Tank If you notice that your hermit crab tank is too hot, take immediate action.\nTurn Off the UTH: Immediately turn off the under-tank heater or decrease the thermostat setting. Increase Ventilation: Increase airflow by opening the lid slightly or using a small fan to circulate air across the tank. Be cautious not to dry out the substrate too quickly, as this can lower the humidity. Misting: Gently mist the tank with dechlorinated water to increase humidity and provide a cooling effect. Ice Packs: Place ice packs (wrapped in towels to prevent direct contact) on top of the tank to help lower the temperature. Move the Tank: If possible, move the tank to a cooler location away from direct sunlight or heat sources. Humidity: The Other Half of the Equation Temperature and humidity are interconnected. High humidity helps crabs regulate their body temperature and prevents dehydration.\nIdeal Humidity: Aim for a humidity level between 75% and 85% . Hygrometer: Use a hygrometer to monitor the humidity level in the tank. Maintaining Humidity: Several methods can help maintain adequate humidity: Misting: Regularly mist the tank with dechlorinated water. Water Bowls: Provide shallow dishes of dechlorinated fresh and saltwater for the crabs to soak in. Substrate: Use a substrate mix that retains moisture, such as coconut fiber (Eco Earth) and play sand. Lid: A tight-fitting lid helps retain humidity, but ensure adequate ventilation to prevent mold growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some frequently asked questions related to hermit crab temperature and care.\n1. What happens if the hermit crab tank is too cold? A tank that is too cold can be just as harmful as one that’s too hot. Cold temperatures can lead to lethargy, decreased appetite, and a weakened immune system, making crabs more susceptible to illness. Use an under-tank heater to maintain the appropriate temperature.\n2. Can I use a heat lamp instead of an under-tank heater? While heat lamps can provide warmth, they can also dry out the tank quickly and are less effective at creating a temperature gradient . An under-tank heater is generally recommended as the primary heating source. If using a heat lamp, monitor humidity levels closely.\n3. How do I know if my hermit crab is molting? Signs of molting include lethargy, hiding for extended periods, loss of appetite, a dull appearance, and digging into the substrate. Do not disturb a molting crab. It is a vulnerable time, and they need to be left alone.\n4. What substrate is best for hermit crabs? A mixture of play sand and coconut fiber (Eco Earth) is a popular and effective substrate. The sand provides a stable surface for digging, while the coconut fiber helps retain moisture, maintaining humidity.\n5. How deep should the substrate be? The substrate should be at least 6 inches deep , or three times the height of your largest crab, whichever is greater. This allows the crabs to bury themselves for molting.\n6. What do hermit crabs eat? Hermit crabs are omnivores and require a varied diet. Offer a mix of commercial hermit crab food, fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, and proteins like dried shrimp or mealworms. Always provide a source of calcium , such as cuttlebone.\n7. How often should I clean the hermit crab tank? Spot clean the tank daily, removing any uneaten food or waste. A full substrate change is typically needed every 6-12 months , depending on the size of the tank and the number of crabs.\n8. What type of water should I provide for my hermit crabs? Provide two shallow dishes of water: one with dechlorinated fresh water and one with dechlorinated saltwater (using a marine aquarium salt mix). The saltwater is essential for maintaining shell water and overall health.\n9. Do hermit crabs need toys and enrichment? Yes! Hermit crabs are active and curious creatures. Provide them with plenty of climbing opportunities , such as driftwood, rocks, and vines. Offer extra shells in various sizes and shapes, and rotate toys regularly to keep them entertained.\n10. How long do hermit crabs live? With proper care, hermit crabs can live for 10-20 years or even longer in captivity.\n11. Is it normal for hermit crabs to fight? Shell fighting is common as crabs compete for the best-fitting shells. Provide a variety of shells in different sizes and shapes to minimize fighting. The shells must be bigger than the one they are currently wearing.\n12. Can hermit crabs drown? Yes, hermit crabs can drown if they cannot easily access air. Ensure that water dishes are shallow and that the substrate is deep enough for them to burrow if they need to escape the water.\n13. What size tank do I need for hermit crabs? A minimum of a 10-gallon tank is recommended for two small hermit crabs. For larger crabs or more crabs, a larger tank is necessary. A 20-gallon long or larger is ideal. The general rule is 5 gallons per crab.\n14. Why is my hermit crab not moving? There are several reasons why a hermit crab might not be moving: it could be molting , stressed, sick, or adjusting to a new environment. Observe the crab closely and ensure that the temperature, humidity, and other environmental conditions are optimal.\n15. Are hermit crabs good pets for children? Hermit crabs can be enjoyable pets, but they require specific care and are not ideal for very young children. Older children who are responsible and willing to learn about their needs can make great hermit crab owners. It’s important to teach children how to handle them gently and understand their specific requirements.
