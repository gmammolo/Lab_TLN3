  "text": "Summary\n- Assassin's Creed fatigue is starting to set in for Shadows players, with many struggling to make it through the full game.\n- Map clearing, quest overload, and a lack of notable events in the story are once again contributing to the fatigue that is often seen in the series these days.\n- Others recommend turning on guided exploration an instant assassinations, taking breaks, and doing only what you enjoy to combat fatigue.\nAssassin's Creed games are pretty big, and that causes a problem that is almost unique to the series - fatigue. It may be down to the sheer length of Assassin's Creed games, how much there is to do in them, or the checklist-style nature of the modern games in the series running its course long before people roll the final credits.\nThere were some Assassin's Creed fans who hoped that maybe Assassin's Creed Shadows would buck that trend, myself included, but with just over a month gone after the game's release, that classic fatigue is beginning to kick in for a lot of people.\nAssassin's Creed Shadows Is Following Valhalla's Footsteps By Making Fans Feel Fatigued\nA Reddit user called Jymboh is one such person that has been hit with Assassin's Creed fatigue recently, who called it the \"Valhalla syndrome\" and, because of it, claimed they couldn't keep playing Shadows anymore. In their post, they admit that the world was able to \"seduce me and maintain my attention\", but that the map clearing a story had everything feeling \"messy\".\nRelated\nGhost of Yotei Is The Revenge Story Assassin's Creed Shadows Should Have Been\nFrom a single trailer alone, I'm already more invested in Atsu's pursuit of revenge.\nAnother user called ContributionOk7429 describes \"getting fatigued\" in the middle of Act 2, disappointed that \"nothing notable\" happens in that part of the game. Caesar_TP says that the game starts feeling like \"meaningless slop\" to them, mostly down to all the markers and quests thrown at them, and a lot of people are still disappointed that Ubisoft has seemingly stopped making linear stories.\nOther players recommend turning on guided exploration, instant assassinations, and auto QTEs to try and make the game faster and less like a chore, while Garrett_DB urges players to only do what they want to and take breaks to start and curb the fatigue a bit. It's sad to see this happen to another Assassin's Creed game yet again, but it's difficult to expect anything else from Ubisoft these days.\nYour comment has not been saved\nAssassin's Creed Shadows\n-\nOpenCritic Reviews - Top Critic Avg: 82/100 Critics Rec: 83%\n- Released\n- March 20, 2025\n- ESRB\n- Mature 17+ // Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Language\n- Developer(s)\n- Ubisoft Quebec\n- Publisher(s)\n-\nUbisoft - Engine\n- AnvilNext",
