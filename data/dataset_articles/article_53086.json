  "text": "Have you ever agreed to an athletic activity that sounded like a great idea, right up until it wasn’t? I’ve done this more times than I can count. If you know that feeling, you’ll relate to this Doodle on a deeply personal level. What started as a cheerful spring jog with his speedy cousin quickly turned into a hilarious case of instant regret. Just a few bouncy steps in, this floofy pup realized he was in way over his head. Watch his change of heart in the laugh-out-loud video shared by @twistandmav on April 26: I get it, Murphy! I also have some athletic friends I’ve joined for outdoor activities, and I regretted my choices once we hit the trail! Though this adorable Doodle might’ve been begging to tag along with his well-conditioned cousin Maverick, he was only 2/10 of a mile in when he knew he’d made a mistake. Related: The 6 Most Popular Doodle Dog Breeds and Poodle Mixes, According to a Veterinarian On the bright side, at least he figured it out early instead of a mile or more in. And you can’t blame a guy for trying or for knowing what he wants. Some of us just aren’t born to run . Watch Maverick get his run club pals pumped up in this video! People could relate to Murphy’s exercise regret. @nifferq remarked, “Wanted to be included until he realized what inclusion meant—we’ve all been there.” @haleycspohrer added, “Murph is my ideal dog!” And @anet_and_makai joked, “We’ve all been there: go to the run club because the cute guy invites you, then you realize you are at a RUN CLUB.” 🐶 SIGN UP to get “pawsitivity” delivered right to your inbox with inspiring & entertaining stories about our furry & feathered friends 🐾🐾 According to the AKC , some breeds, like Belgian Malinois , Weimaraners , and Vizslas , are natural-born runners , while others, like many Doodles, prefer to walk. Factors like age, size, and energy level can influence whether a dog is a sprinter , a stroller, or a professional couch potato. And based on this video, Murphy knows which category he belongs in. While some of us are like Maverick, many of us have a bit of Murphy in us, too. Ambitious at first, but happier to cheer from the sidelines… and that’s more than okay!",
