  "text": "During a recent episode of his Truth After Dark podcast, former NBA star Paul Pierce raised eyebrows after making controversial remarks about why he believes many NBA players date white women.\nPierce's co-host, Azar Farideh, posed the question, prompting Pierce to respond: “Because they maybe appreciate more, and they apologize more,” a comment that drew laughter from those in the room. He went on to say that white women “don’t mind being held accountable.”\nThe discussion recalled a previous podcast moment when actor Columbus Short made similar comments during an interview with Farideh. At the time, Short said, “There is no respect of the man, the Black man, in that by a Black woman.” His remarks were widely criticized, prompting Short to issue a public apology.\n“I realize that I seriously offended my Black women in a way that was not intended,” Short said. “That clip was taken out of context. I know that was clickbait.”\nPierce’s recent comments have already begun to generate conversation on social media, reigniting ongoing debates around race, relationships, and public responsibility among celebrities.\nSource: YouTube",
