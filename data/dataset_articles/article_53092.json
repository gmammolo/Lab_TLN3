  "text": "Summary\n- Players criticize Infinity Nikki's update for major story changes, bugs, and glitches.\n- Changes include new tutorial, which fans have accused of hurting the storyline.\nInfinity Nikki players are voicing their discontent over recent changes made to the game's opening story. The alterations are part of Infinity Nikki's recent 1.5 update, which fans have heavily criticized.\nThe highly anticipated Infinity Nikki Version 1.5 on April 29 did not go as smoothly as players had hoped. The patch brought some long-requested features like the Dye System and co-op multiplayer. However, the update was struck by multiple bugs, visual glitches, and the inability to log in properly. The number of reports was so large that Infinity Nikki's developers issued an apology and promised to launch over a dozen fixes in the next few days. Now, players are sharing their frustration over some unexpected changes made to Infinity Nikki's story.\nRelated\nInfinity Nikki: How to Unlock All Bubble Season Outfits (Update 1.5)\nThere are plenty of bubbly new looks to collect and show off in Infinity Nikki's Bubble Season, and here's how to unlock them all.\nOn the Infinity Nikki subreddit, players have pointed out that the 1.5 update has greatly altered the game's opening story section. User shirasakirin made a side-by-side comparison of Infinity Nikki's old and new beginnings. The first major change made is that Nikki no longer starts her journey in her mother's attic. Instead, she mysteriously spawns in Infinity Nikki's \"Sea of Stars\" co-op level, changing the lore behind how Nikki arrives at Miraland. Another major change made involves Ena's introduction, who was originally imprisoned before granting Nikki the Heart of Infinity in a powerful cutscene. Now, Ena meets Nikki free of bounds and reveals that Nikki has possessed the Heart of Infinity \"at the dawn of all things.\" The new dialogues also imply that Ena may not return later in the story. \"It's a shame that they removed so many wonderful things from the tutorial,\" added the fan.\nInfinity Nikki Version 1.5 Makes Major Changes to the Game's Story\nAnother user named Infinitype pointed out that the Threads of Reunion outfit, a fan-favorite unreleased 5-star set, is now completely removed from the tutorial chapter. There are also many changes in how Nikki joins the Stylist Guild, meets Dada, and obtains her Pear Pad. \"Honestly, the old tutorial was better; now it feels too disjointed,\" they wrote. User RyanCooper138 wrote a post commenting that the alterations are too drastic, and that the new version leaves too many plot holes. \"This new Sea of Stars sequence with the Seer, while visually breathtaking, has very little substance from the story perspective,\" they argued. Fellow players have echoed their disapproval of the changes made to Infinity Nikki's main story, with some deeming them unnecessary and poorly executed.\nPlayers had high expectations for Version 1.5, as it also marked Infinity Nikki's debut on Steam. Unfortunately, the update's flaws seem to have overshadowed all the features added. It's unclear why the development team decided to change Infinity Nikki's tutorial scenes so much, but perhaps Infold Games will clear players' doubts in the future.\nYour comment has not been saved\nInfinity Nikki\n-\nOpenCritic Reviews - Top Critic Avg: 80/100 Critics Rec: 88%\n- Released\n- December 5, 2024\n- ESRB\n- T For Teen // Blood, Violence\n- Developer(s)\n- Papergames\n- Publisher(s)\n-\nPapergames,\nInfold Games, Fearless - Engine\n- Unreal Engine 5",
