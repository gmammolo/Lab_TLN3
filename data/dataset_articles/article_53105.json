  "text": "The new season of Farmer Wants A Wife has only just begun, but viewers have already witnessed a fair share of trouble in pastoral paradise. Namely, the shock departure of Emmie and Bridget, after the first week with Farmer Tom failed to sow the seeds of affection.\nNoticeably uncomfortable with the whole sheep shearing exercise – which to be fair, can be quite confronting for most people – Emmie explained she was content to remain an “observer” rather than a participant.\nLater that evening, when the group was prepping dinner with Farmer Tom, Emmie and Bridget looked on from the sidelines, choosing to head back to their rooms for a moment of peace while the night continued on.\nPrompted by a message from host Natalie Gruzlewski asking the farmers to select two ladies for a double date, Farmer Tom decided to use the opportunity as a “check in” with both Emmie and Bridget. Meanwhile, Bridget and Emmie were packing their things, having already made the decision to leave well before Farmer Tom even had the chance to say goodbye.\nFor his part, Farmer Tom remained composed enough to wish them well, commenting “It’s good that they know what they are after.”\nWith barely enough time to get a full to-camera from each of the ladies, producers were scrambling to get the inside scoop behind their sudden exit. But lucky for us, both Emmie and Bridget have been more than willing to spill the tea in the days following their on-screen departure, and we are graciously accepting every sip.\nWhy Did Emmie Leave Farmer Tom On Farmer Wants A Wife?\nAs the cameras frantically tried to catch Emmie before she closed the door on farm life forever, she offered up a relatable explanation: “We gave it all we could. But what’s the point in staying if there isn’t something there that both of us want to pursue?”\nViewers were quick to pounce on the pair, calling them rude and impolite for leaving without saying goodbye. But if you were in their situation – one week in – wouldn’t you do the same? Plus, getting a taxi in a rural location is no easy feat. As soon as that cab is available – you grab it and go! So can we really blame them?\nIn the days following, Emmie has been openly sharing her grievances with her Instagram followers, and we are hanging on every word.\nIn a post to her stories, Emmie explained that both she and Bridget made the decision because they weren’t going to “settle for disrespect.”\n“What was happening behind the scenes didn’t align with who I am or what I stand for. There was immaturity, selfishness, and toxic behaviour that I wasn’t willing to tolerate especially from someone I was supposed to be building a connection with,” she wrote.\n“Walking away was the healthiest & BEST choice I could make for myself,” she concluded – and if that’s not a refreshing take on the reality show rodeo than we don’t know what is.\nIn a subsequent IG Q&A, Emmie went into detail, letting her followers know that she had “absolutely zero tolerance for grown adults who think it’s okay to bully, belittle, or gang up on someone.”\n“Watching someone constantly get dragged down by the same toxic behaviour? Not on my watch. I will always stand up for the ones who are kind, quiet, or different because they deserve support, not cruelty. We’re too old for high school drama. Be better.”\nShe also had some choice words for Farmer Tom, who she called “immature” after revealing she had “icky vibes” about him from the start.\nWhy Did Bridget Leave Farmer Tom On Farmer Wants A Wife?\nAs producers watched the ladies leave Farmer Tom’s homestead, they reached out with one last question, asking Bridget why she wouldn’t stay to say goodbye, to which she responded: “I’m sorry, I’m gonna politely decline.”\nIn the days following, Bridget also shared details of her own through her dog’s Instagram account @laceythegreyhound – which is a legendary move in itself.\n“There’s so much the show didn’t reveal,” Lacey – aka Bridget – revealed in a series of Instagram stories this week.\n“They left out the moment when the farmer was openly rude to my Ma in front of everyone, just hours after she arrived on the farm. Other contestants and the House A/P (featured in my story) immediately checked in with her, concerned about how she’d been treated. My Ma retreated to her room to read a book because this made her feel safe in an uncomfortable environment,” she added.\nIn another shock turn of events, Lacey revealed that Farmer Tom admitted to the ladies that he actually didn’t even sign onto the show himself. Instead, his mother had “done it all for him” which as she noted “changes the whole context.”\nLet’s be real – that’s a glaring red flag in itself, and the admission alone would be enough for most viewers to go running for the hills – let alone everything else.\nPlus, can we just normalise contestants leaving reality tv shows when the experience is no longer serving them? Why force themselves into a situation they weren’t comfortable with for the viewers?\nMore of this, please and thank you.",
