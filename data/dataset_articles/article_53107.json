  "text": "Pizza restaurant Mellow Mushroom announced Wednesday via social media that it will close \"indefinitely\" this Sunday.\nMellow Mushroom began in 1974 in Atlanta and has franchises throughout the country. The locally owned Denton location, at 217 E. Hickory St., opened in 2011 and became a staple restaurant for some folks. The restaurant is part of the Denton Main Street Association.\n\"Anytime we see a business close downtown, it's definitely something that we don't like to see,\" association President Kristen Kendrick Bigley said Wednesday. \"But there's many reasons why businesses make that decision.\"\nLocal residents have shared their thoughts on Mellow Mushroom closing and their memories of the restaurant.\nUniversity of North Texas alumnus and sports videographer David Horn said he remembers visiting the restaurant frequently with fellow members of coed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega after service events and meetings.\n\"It was always a good environment,\" Horn said.\nDenton-based vintage clothing vendor Jacob Kerstetter had mixed memories.",
