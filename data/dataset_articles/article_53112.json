  "text": "A dermatologist has warned Australians to be careful with the latest skincare routine going viral on TikTok.\nTia Zakher is credited with kickstarting interest in the 'caveman method', a skin routine that involves cutting out all skincare products in an attempt to resolve persistent skin concerns.\nTikTok videos she's made about following the method have racked up more than 50 million views the last week alone and worldwide Google searches for the term 'caveman method' spiked on April 27, just two days after one of her first videos went up.\nBut Zakher has taken the caveman method one step further, claiming in a TikTok video with more than 9 million views that she has not been washing her face with water.\nThe 22-year-old, whose skin appeared clear in Instagram photos from 2024, stated in the caption of a different video that she has been doing this for at least six weeks.\nThe result is a layer of \"dead skin\" which appears to be flaking off her forehead, nose, cheeks and chin.\nHundreds of social media users have questioned Zakher's commitment to the routine, some with medical backgrounds alleging that she may be suffering from a skin infection as a result of not washing her face.\nQueensland dermatologist Dr Michael Freeman told 9news.com.au that not cleansing the face at all can lead to an increased risk of infection.\n\"We all carry staph about 10 per cent of the time so if you've shaken someone's hand and rubbed your hand on your face, you could have germs on your face,\" he told 9news.com.au.\nThose germs could lead to an infection if left on the face, so \"it doesn't make sense not to cleanse that contaminant\".\nWhile dermatologists may recommend patients not wash their face with hot water, Freeman does not usually suggest they abstain from washing their faces altogether.\nThough it may sound like a modern social media fad, the caveman method – or some version of it – has been around for years and dermatologists even recommend it to patients in some cases.\n\"It's quite common for us in dermatology to see people who have a problem with the products they're putting on their face,\" he said.\n\"So the best thing is stop everything, and that's pretty much the caveman routine.\"\nCommon skincare concerns that can be traced back to specific products or ingredients include contact dermatitis, allergic reactions, redness, inflammation, sensitivity, flares in acne or rosacea, and damage to the skin barrier.\nCutting out all skincare products, as in the caveman method, then reintroducing them one by one may help patients identify what is causing their skin concerns.\nHowever, Freeman warned that this is only intended as a short-term routine to identify and address skin concerns that may be linked to certain skincare products.\n\"The last thing that I would like to suggest is that this is a good routine to use forever,\" he said.\n\"In my mind, dermatologically speaking, it should only be used temporarily.\"\nPatients should also continue using SPF while following the routine, as skipping it increases the risk of sun damage and melanoma.\nWATCH: 9News presenter issues warning after skin cancer scare\nFreeman cautioned Australians against taking specific skincare advice from influencers, as what works for one person will not be suitable for everyone.\nHe suggested speaking to a dermatologist or GP about skin concerns, or seeking information online or using AI tools before starting a new skin routine.\nZakher has not responded to questions from 9news.com.au about her skincare routine, if she has consulted with a dermatologist, or the online reaction.\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
