  "text": "{p}Mobile's Stephen Toomey is getting worried about the cost of carnival.{/p}{p}\"Well, I've never carried a rabbit's foot in my pocket by I am right now!\" he says. \"These days... I'm fairly optimistic about it, that's why we keep delaying stuff, but it can't go on like this. It's unsustainable.\"{/p}{p}Mardi Gras may be 10 months away, but Toomey, owner of Toomey's Mardi Gras store, says those who ride the floats in Mobile don't wait until the last minute to buy their beads and other carnival notions. And as they plan for next year's big celebrations, they're getting the sobering news that the tariffs levied at China could have them paying more.{/p}{p}A lot more.{/p}{p}\"This time of year, we work with a lot of krews in doing their custom items and so forth, that they, in turn, sell back to their membership. Right now, we're kind of on hold with that. We're still meeting with them, placing the order, but not giving them a firm price until we know where these tariffs are gonna land.\"{/p}{p}Toomey says a firm price on products he imports is impossible to estimate right now.{/p}{p}\"Who knows,\" he says. \"It could change at the drop of a hat.\"{/p}{p}Nearly everything in Toomey's comes from China.{/p}{p}Right now, the tariff President Trump has placed on such Chinese imports is 145%.{/p}{p}To give you an idea of how a 145% tariff would affect purchases at Toomeys, consider a bag of foam footballs at $45 for 30. {/p}{p}But with a 145% tariff, you'll pay well over $100.{/p}{p}\"And it's not just us,\" says the Mardi Gras merchant. \"I know Mardi Gras is a huge part of our culture here. But if you think about all of the people who won't be able to afford product, then the sales taxes are affected... the state, the local state and federal taxes... oh, my gosh! It could be horrible for our overall economy.\"{/p}{p}So, what can be done?{/p}{p}Toomey says he has very few options and he's already exercising some of them.{/p}{p}\"We've been pre-ordering. We have a container due in next month around May 15th. Rather than having it delivered here, we're taking it to a warehouse and having it stored there until these tariffs come down because we'd rather pay those fees than the tariffs right now at 145%.\"{/p}{p}In the meantime, what stock he currently has on hand is still going at pre-tariff prices... meaning now might be a good time to make those purchases if you can.{/p}{p} And if the tariffs do cause the price of those beads, stuffed animals and other throws to skyrocket, Mardi gras suppliers , like Toomey's may have to get creative when it comes to what you catch.{/p}{p}\"More Moon Pies! I better call up and place a big order with Chattanooga Bakery.\"{/p}\",\"readAloud\":null,\"iabTags\":null,\"isReadAloudChecked\":true,\"derivedImages\":{\"externalId\":\"8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec\",\"heroImageFromPackageMedia\":{\"type\":\"Image\",\"uuid\":\"905d7573-73e5-400f-af5e-1f32695d3018\",\"title\":\"(NBC 15 STAFF PHOTO)\",\"updatedBy\":\"Darwin Singleton\",\"created\":1746065239000,\"version\":3,\"attributes\":[],\"caption\":\"New shipments of bags of beads at Toomey's Mardi Gras will more than double in price if the President's current tariffs on China remain in place.{p}{/p}\",\"description\":\"Screenshot 2025-04-30 205931.jpg\",\"externalId\":\"8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec\",\"versionSetUuid\":\"eee08d8d-99ff-45e4-bbfa-4a109280d997\",\"alt\":\"Screenshot 2025-04-30 205931.jpg\",\"original\":\"false\",\"metadata\":\"{}\",\"orderNumber\":1,\"brandUuid\":\"45f47c5a-cfe7-4d98-bd87-e383736d06a8\",\"brandUuidList\":[\"8050b79f-6f70-4457-b359-193c723aed99\"],\"originalUrl\":\"/resources/media/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"height\":651,\"width\":1236,\"large16x9Url\":\"/resources/media2/16x9/1157/986/40x0/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"medium16x9Url\":\"/resources/media2/16x9/1157/648/40x0/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"small16x9Url\":\"/resources/media2/16x9/1157/160/40x0/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"large36x25Url\":\"/resources/media2/36x25/937/360/150x0/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"medium36x25Url\":\"/resources/media2/36x25/937/144/150x0/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"small36x25Url\":\"/resources/media2/36x25/937/72/150x0/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"large1x1Url\":\"/resources/media2/1x1/651/800/293x0/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"medium1x1Url\":\"/resources/media2/1x1/651/200/293x0/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"small1x1Url\":\"/resources/media2/1x1/651/90/293x0/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"largeScaleUrl\":\"/resources/media2/original/1236/768/center/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"smallScaleUrl\":\"/resources/media2/original/1236/415/center/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"originalBlurUrl\":\"/resources/media2/original/1236/1236/center/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"largeBlurUrl\":\"/resources/media2/original/1236/768/center/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"smallBlurUrl\":\"/resources/media2/original/1236/415/center/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"isGif\":false,\"fileName\":\"Screenshot 2025-04-30 205931.jpg\",\"jumbo16x9Url\":\"/resources/media2/16x9/1157/1320/40x0/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"jumbo36x25Url\":\"/resources/media2/36x25/937/544/150x0/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"large3x4Url\":\"/resources/media2/3x4/488/960/374x0/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"renditions\":{\"large16x9\":{\"uuid\":null,\"label\":\"large16x9\",\"url\":\"/resources/media2/16x9/1157/986/40x0/90/8c2f5859-d9e5-4717-babe-30ca2c53abec-Screenshot20250430205931.jpg\",\"id\":\"90914935-c8d4-4865-ad44-bc56697746f6\",\"x\":40,\"y\":0,\"width\":1157,\"preciseWidth\":null,\"height\":651,\"preciseHeight\":null,\"scaleWidth\":986,\"name\":\"large16x9Url\",\"blurSigma\":-1,\"rendition\":\"large16x9\",\"labelOrConvertedName\":\"large16x9",
