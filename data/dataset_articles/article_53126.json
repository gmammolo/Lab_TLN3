  "text": "Summary\n- A game-breaking teleport bug in Marvel Rivals trapped a player in spawn until using their Ultimate.\n- Many fans empathized with the frustrated player as they struggled with the glitch during a competitive match.\n- NetEase is working to address bugs in Marvel Rivals, helping to maintain a fun and fair environment for players.\nA Marvel Rivals player discovered an annoying bug that caused them to keep teleporting back to base. Released last December, Marvel Rivals is already one of the most popular PvP hero shooters, as it brings together many of Marvel's most powerful heroes and villains.\nMarvel Rivals is currently in its second season, debuting Emma Frost, the new Hellfire Gala: Krakoa map, and the upcoming Hellfire Gala skin line, among many new features. While players are grinding the game to reach their desired ranks and completing their battle passes in Season 2, NetEase is also hard at work to address any issues that might affect the overall experience.\nRelated\nMarvel Rivals Reveals MCU Skin for Winter Soldier\nMarvel Rivals surprises players by giving them a sneak peek of a new skin for Winter Soldier based on his appearance in the MCU.\nBut sometimes, Marvel Rivals fans still experience some bugs and glitches in-game, like a game-breaking teleport bug. A player named Hyrax_Hub shared a one-minute clip on Reddit to show that they couldn't leave spawn when they joined their first competitive game in the current patch. The clip showed that they kept teleporting back to spawn as Rocket and Adam Warlock. While the player couldn't figure out how to resolve the bug at first, they found that using their character's Ultimate stopped the loop.\nMarvel Rivals Fans React to Teleport Loop Bug\nIn the comments, many Marvel Rivals fans empathized with the player because of the hassle that the bug caused during their match. They also found the situation funny because of how \"desperate\" Rocket and Adam looked in the video as they tried to get out of spawn. One also joked that the player was on \"forced healer strike,\" which references Marvel Rivals players' \"support strike\" due to the negative comments towards people playing the Strategist role in matches.\nAs of writing, it's unknown if Marvel Rivals managed to fix the game-breaking teleport loop bug. Although not many players under Hyrax_Hub's post experienced this specific bug, they're still hopeful that the game finds a fix because it might affect matches in the future. Fortunately, Marvel Rivals regularly releases patch updates, with the most recent being on April 30, so there's a chance that this bug will be resolved in the next one.\nMeanwhile, many Marvel Rivals fans are looking forward to mid-Season 2 content, which will include the debut of Ultron as a playable character. The next big update will also include minor adjustments to Groot and Captain America, and balance changes and adjustments to ensure that matches are fun and fair for everyone.\nYour comment has not been saved\nMarvel Rivals\n-\nOpenCritic Reviews - Top Critic Avg: 78/100 Critics Rec: 83%\n- Released\n- December 6, 2024\n- ESRB\n- T For Teen // Violence\n- Developer(s)\n- NetEase Games\n- Publisher(s)\n- NetEase Games\n- Engine\n- Unreal Engine 5\nMarvel Rivals is a Super Hero Team-Based PVP Shooter!\nAssemble an all-star Marvel squad, devise countless strategies by combining powers to form unique Team-Up skills and fight in destructible, ever-changing battlefields across the continually evolving Marvel universe!\nA Deep and Varied Marvel Roster\nChoose from a vast array of fan-favorite and cult-classic Marvel Super Heroes and Super Villains from across the Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, X-Men, and many more from across the Marvel Multiverse.\nFast and Fun 6v6 Action with Ever-Changing Game Dynamics\nWith intricate environments, fast-paced gameplay, and ever-changing battlefields, there's never a dull moment in Marvel Rivals!
