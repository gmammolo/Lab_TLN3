  "text": "“Be visible, be reliable, and be responsible.”\nPresident Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. on Thursday called for a more responsive, reliable, and people-centered police force as the country marked the first-ever Philippine National Police (PNP) Day.\nIn a speech delivered by Executive Secretary Ralph G. Recto during the PNP Day 2026 ceremony at Camp Crame in Quezon City, President Marcos said the PNP’s responsibility to community safety has evolved as risks have become more complex.\n“In this context, peace and order is no longer defined only by the absence of crime. Rather, it is measured by response efficiency, public confidence, and the sense of safety citizens feel,” said the President.\n“Serbisyong nararamdaman at kapulisang maaasahan ang kailangan ng bawat mamamayang Pilipino,” the President added.\nThe Chief Executive acknowledged that even as security challenges remain, crime rates have dropped, the campaign against illegal drugs has continued, and public safety programs are being strengthened.\n“But beyond the numbers, what matters most is that families go home safe, businesses operate with confidence, and communities feel protected,” President Marcos emphasized.\n“As we move forward, the call to service is simple but demanding. Be visible, be reliable, and be responsible,” the President directed.\nThe President reaffirmed his administration’s support to all necessary capacity-building programs to enhance the PNP’s preparedness and professional development.\nThis year, the PNP has been allocated a budget of PhP226 billion that will cover the increase in the daily subsistence allowance of police personnel and the hiring of at least 2,000 additional personnel to bring the police-to-population ratio closer to the ideal of 1:500.\nPresident Marcos recognized the outstanding PNP units, personnel, and other partners whose service embodies the highest standards of professionalism, discipline, and integrity.\nThe President also acknowledged the families of police officers for sharing in their sacrifice. | PND",
