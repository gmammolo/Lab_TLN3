  "text": "Gordon Strachan was forced out of his hotel room to make way for famous singer\nPosted Thursday, May 01, 2025 by Dailystar.co.uk\nEx-Scotland and Celtic manager Gordon Strachan was known for his no-nonsense demeanour from pitch side, but even he once had to concede when an A-list pop star rolled into town\nGordon Strachan had to seek alternative lodgings (file)\nFormer Scotland and Celtic manager Gordon Strachan has revealed he was forced out of his hotel room to make way for singer Beyonce.\nStrachan, 68, said the global superstar had booked into the plush Mar Hall hotel near Glasgow as she prepared to play a gig in Scotland. The five-star venue was a regular choice for visiting showbusiness figures but also played host to the Scotland squad during international breaks.\nEx-Aberdeen and Manchester United hero Strachan said he had been on Scotland duties when Beyonce’s visit prompted a bedroom swap that saw him forced to change rooms. He said: “Scotland used to train at Mar Hall and they had a lot of stars staying there.\nBeyonce was rolling into town (file)\n“I had to move out once when Beyonce was staying there, I had to move out my room so that Beyonce could stay in it. It was great because I told the girls not to change the covers.”\nStrachan told his ex-Man Utd teammate Brian McClair’s podcast: “My wife doesn’t know that story so lets just keep that to ourselves.”\nStrachan played for Dundee, Aberdeen, Man Utd, Leeds United and Coventry City. He was part of the Aberdeen side that defeated Real Madrid 2-1 to lift the 1983 European Cup Winners’ Cup in Gothenburg.\nHe had earlier told McClair how he swapped fan mail with iconic singer Neil Diamond after meeting him at Mar Hall. He said: “I realised Neil Diamond was in and he’s a hero of mine.\n“I was sitting with Mark McGhee and the rest of the coaches and Neil was sitting with his missus. Mark was saying go and speak to him and I was saying, no, he’s having a great time and doesn’t get much peace. We never said anything but I met his manager and ended up writing a letter to him.”\nStrachan was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame in 2007 and named Scotland national coach in 2013. McClair’s Life with Brian podcast has featured a string of guests including comedian Jonathan Watson and Deacon Blue singer Ricky Ross.\nPhotos\nMore»\nGolf Wag Jena Sims 'test drives her bikinis for summer'\n[[PICTURE SPECIAL] Barcelona 3 Inter Milan 3](/photo/data/20250501/16898.shtml)",
