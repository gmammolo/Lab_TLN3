  "text": "The Beginning After the End's anime adaptation is now five episodes in, and while it's certainly had its ups and downs, I still keep tuning in each week to find out what could possibly happen next. Episode 5, \"The King's Test\" had some interesting story developments, but the one thing that continues to hold this anime back hangs over it like a dark cloud, and that's the animation quality.\nFor an anime with so much action-potential, quality animation is essential to drive things home. The Beginning After the End's story definitely has high points that resonate with a lot of viewers, but when it comes to anime, story alone can't be enough to sustain a series, especially when it's new and trying to make a mark in an incredibly competitive medium. I do not deny that Arthur Leywin's story is an interesting one, interesting enough that I even started reading the webcomic after Episode 1 because I wanted to know more, but knowing more doesn't improve the many issues the anime has.\nWeek after week, the story progresses, and before long there will likely be even more high-action scenes in need of animation. The way things are now, the anime will never be able to do those scenes the justice they deserve. Maybe that makes me a cynic, but that doesn't mean I'm wrong. The Beginning After the End has so much potential, but maybe this particular anime adaptation isn't the one that will live up to it. It wouldn't be the first time an anime has seen multiple adaptations, which I know sounds silly when considering we haven't even finished the first cour of Season 1 yet. For those willing to see this through to the end, I am pretty sure it will be the story holding them in place, and not the animation.\nRelated\nMy Patience is Beginning to End For The Beginning After the End\nArthur Leywin's inner voice guides him into a dangerous rescue mission that should be far more than a four-year-old can handle alone.\nThe Kingdom of Elves Has No Interest In Welcoming Arthur\nArthur Saving Princess Tessia Doesn't Matter Much to the People of Elonoir\nPassing through the portal in the forest at the end of The Beginning After the End Episode 4, fans were left wondering by the Episode 5 preview whether Tessia had somehow betrayed Arthur, even after calling him her friend. Immediately seized by guards, Tessia is slow to jump to his defense at first, which pushes the voice of his previous life to reflect on her manipulating him. Arthur is all too driven by the cynical voice of King Grey, who has guided this new life to his own design from the moment he came into the world in a new body for a second chance at life.\nGiven the things King Grey endured during his reign, from betrayal to assassination, it's no wonder he's got trust issues, but Tessia has been a solid representation of innocent, if not a little spoiled, since the moment they met. Just when he's convinced she betrayed him, she jumps to his defense, explaining that he saved her. The elven guards are so anti-human, they're convinced that this four-year-old boy manipulated and brainwashed their princess, which falls back on one of my issues from last week's episode.\nRelated\n'I Felt It Necessary for Me to Speak Up': The Beginning After the End Creator Updates Fans on Controversial Anime Series\nThe Beginning After the End creator TurtleMe opens up following backlash to the highly anticipated and widely criticized Spring 2025 anime adaptation.\nArthur being four still doesn't sit well with me. I know it's fantasy, but it's still hard to suspend my personal disbelief that a kid that young could do the things he can. Even with the power of a dragon and his skilled past-life guiding the way, he's just too overpowered for me sometimes.\nWhen Tessia's grandpa, Virion Eralith, arrives via portal in time to stop the guards from making a horrendous mistake, he rationalizes they can hardly be blamed. The elf princess was missing, and she returned with a human in tow. This is the first time Arthur has heard the news that Tessia is more than just an elf girl. She's Princess of Elenoir, which means things are about to get even more complicated.\nElenoir Welcomes Arthur Leywin, But Not Without Prejudice & Hesitation\nPrincess Tessia Insists They Show Arthur Their Gratitude & Hospitality\nOne of the nice things about this episode is seeing the future generation, which will one day reshape relations between warring nations, making more sense than their parents and the old grudges. Even after Tessia's mother and father arrive, the cliched elven prejudice against Arthur evident on the king's face, Tessia thinks of Art as her friend. The fact that he's human doesn't really bother her much at all, which suggests their bond has the potential to shape the future and rid their world of the racial tensions that hold their people apart.\nEven as they are reluctant to agree, Tessia insists they welcome Arthur into their home. Once inside the palace, she gives a speech to the servants, asking them to treat him with respect and pointing out that he is not a bad human. As the two later gather around the table with her parents and grandfather, Arthur explains the circumstances behind Tessia's rescue, but the king doesn't believe he could possibly be capable of taking out bandits, even if he is a mage. As Tessia confirms she was kidnapped and the bandits wanted to sell her off, the king admits to believing Arthur.\nRelated\nSpring 2025's Overlooked Action Fantasy Anime Becomes Sudden Major Streaming Hit\nA streaming service not usually known for popular new anime is seeing an overlooked new fantasy anime in the same viewership category as Reacher.\nArthur uses this opportunity to ask the king for help. As he was also attacked by bandits, and separated from his family, he would like help returning to and reuniting with them. The king is put off by this request, but when he calls Arthur a human savage, Arthur reasons that their claim to superiority had him expecting they would not display such savage behavior themselves. That is enough to convince the king, and though the portal doesn't open but once every seven years for the representatives of all three races to meet, he will consent to having some of his men escort Arthur back to Sapin.\nArthur Has Been Allowing Grey's Experiences To Influence His Outlook\nRealizing this Is a Big Step For His Character\nEpisode 4 had Arthur doubling over in pain, and though the agony he felt seemed to dissipate after he ate the mushrooms he and Tessia foraged, the pain wasn't hunger. It seems to be coming on him more frequently, growing more agonizing with each attack on his body. As he's standing in the shower clutching his chest, he quietly seeks Sylvia's guidance, asking her what it means and what he can do. There is no answer, of course, but that's only a temporary issue.\nArthur heads outside after his shower, recognizing that the cool breeze soothes the pain, but he can't take much more of it. He needs to understand why it's happening. When he glances up at the balcony overhead, he sees Tessia with her parents and begins thinking of his own mother and father, wondering if they are okay. He openly admits he misses them, but he can't help but wonder if they will be as happy to be reunited with him as Tessia's parents are to see her again.\nRelated\nCrunchyroll Pushes Play on Isekai Smash-Hit Overlord Movie\nThe latest entry in the Overlord anime adaptation is finally heading to streaming on Crunchyroll after its 2024 theatrical debut.\nAs he and Tessia run into each other in the hallway, he teases her about having spoiled princess time with her family. She actually came to apologize to him for how rude her father and the others were to him. He admits that it's probably just because they were so happy she came back to them, and that's why she should take advantage of them spoiling her. He can't help wondering if his parents will even be happy to see him again, believing it to have been his fault they were attacked in the first place. This isn't Arthur's fear, so much as Grey's influence, but Tessia tries to put the thoughts out of his mind when she grabs him by the face and scolds him for thinking that way.\nAs fireflies light up around them, Arthur thinks of his mother and father again, as Tessia sits in the grass and explains that the flowers around her are called Firefly pots. Arthur can't help but think about the face Tessia wore when they first returned to her home and found themselves surrounded by soldiers. He was sure she'd betrayed him, but then he realizes he is allowing too much of Arthur's experience to be shaped by Grey's past, as if he's constantly warring with a life that isn't even his. This is the first time he's had a realization like this, and it's a great turning point for his character, who softens immensely and allows himself to enjoy Tessia's enthusiasm for the flowers and the fireflies around them.\nArthur's Been In Agony Since Leaving Sylvia\nCan Tessia's Grandpa Help Make Sense of What's Wrong With him\nWhile the pair are enjoying the fireflies, Virion makes a surprise attack in an effort to test Arthur's true abilities. After learning that he single-handedly took out those bandits with sorcery, the former king of Elenoir wants to see just how powerful this human boy really is. At first, Arthur is appalled that he would attack his own granddaughter, but when he admits his trick wouldn't have hurt anyone, Arthur is still worried. Tessia confronts him, asking why he came to pick on him, but Virion explains he hasn't taken this kind of interest in someone in a very long time.\nVirion summons a wooden sword and tosses it to Arthur, then begins putting him through his paces. This whole scene had the potential to be truly epic, but instead, its still shot after still shot with comic panel-like breaks to express the character's reactions and motion lines blurring across the top and bottom. It's disappointing, to say the least.\nOnce the battle ends, Virion explains to Arthur that he wants him to become his apprentice. Arthur is hesitant, because his parents don't know that he's still alive, but Virion ensures him that they will inform his family that he is alive and well. Within a second of this, the pain Arthur has been experience nearly overwhelms him, which prompts Virion to explain that he has inherited a Beast Will, and becoming his apprentice is the only way to save his life.\nRelated\nThese 10/10 Isekai Anime Prove the Genre Is Worth It\nIsekai anime like Inuyasha and Mushoku Tensei are 10/10 series that make the most of characters building new lives in another world.\nCliffhanger ending, not unexpected, but all-in-all, the story in this episode was decently paced, and as has happened nearly every time, it's keeping me coming back week after week to find out where it goes next. That does not do much for the animation quality, and as I mentioned above, no matter how intriguing the story is at this point, poorly animated action scenes are not going to keep anime fans coming back for more for very long.\nIt's a massive disapppointment because, while countries like China and Korea are finding success in Japanese anime, North America's not having the same experience at all. A story like The Beginning After the End is perfect for anime, but the disservice it's been done is going to leave a bad taste in the mouths of a lot of fans. As I mentioned above, I can only hope that one day, a better animation studio with a bigger budget and clear vision comes back to this story and gives it the treatment it deserves.\nYour comment has not been saved\nThe Beginning After the End\n- Release Date\n- April 2, 2025\n- Network\n- AT-X\nCast\n-\nNatsumi FujiwaraArthur Leywin (voice)\n-\nMakoto FurukawaGrey (voice)\n- Creator(s)\n- TurtleMe\n- Intriguing story developments\n- Bad animation quality\n- High fantasy tropes are still cliche",
