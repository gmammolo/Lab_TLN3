  "text": "Evelyn Parker’s arc in Cyberpunk 2077 is truly tragic, as it is brilliantly crafted yet frustratingly final. Her early presence anchors the heist-flow and makes the player care about more than just the relic. But once she’s handed off to Fingers and traumatized beyond recovery, the game closes the door on her future.\nIf that door had been kept open and V could reach her earlier, before the brain damage and before the flatline, Evelyn could’ve become a high-value character in Cyberpunk 2077, not just emotionally, but functionally. Being able to save her would’ve altered side quests, faction politics, and even the final act. After all, she knew the Voodoo Boys, had access to high-tier braindance tech, and was more than just a fixer’s pawn.\nRelated\nCyberpunk 2077: What Happened to Evelyn Parker?\nEvelyn Parker's tragic fall in Cyberpunk 2077 highlights the dangers of ambition in Night City's ruthless world of exploitation.\nEvelyn Could've Been V’s Best Ally (Or Greatest Threat)\nEvelyn Parker in Cyberpunk 2077 was a rogue player trying to become a power broker in Night City’s most volatile circles. If rescued early, she could’ve been integrated into multiple questlines: undermining NetWatch, double-crossing Wakako, or even helping V bypass Brigitte’s gatekeeping. Her skills were never fully capitalized on either, so if she were alive, it would’ve allowed V to branch into side missions where she could build custom BDs to simulate heists or infiltrations, offering V a non-lethal or sensory-driven alternative to brute force in the process.\nHowever, there’s also that dynamic of Judy Alvarez's loyalty becoming conditional in the process. Her conflict with Evelyn could escalate if Evelyn’s ambitions go unchecked. Something like this would’ve also made V question whether he wants to side with the idealist or the opportunist. Better yet, Evelyn might even have pulled a full pivot and sided with Arasaka for protection, if not revenge. That sets up high-stakes betrayal potential near the endgame, and V might have invested in her survival only to watch her sell out.\nIt Would Also Trigger Functional Divergence in the Game’s Core Loop\nMechanically, Evelyn’s survival could’ve unlocked new ways to approach critical missions. She had deep technical knowledge and a personal vendetta, which is the perfect justification for giving V access to alternate infiltration plans, stealth missions, or even sensory overwatch through Cyberpunk's BD relay networks. These would create meaningful variations in approach without needing an overhaul of the map or AI behavior. She could serve as a pseudo-fixer or ghost netrunner and offer players who saved her unique mission trees unavailable otherwise.\nSaving Evelyn Could've Been the Moral Test Before the Ending\nIf handled right, Evelyn would become the first real test of player agency. For instance, a player could save her, and change the tone of the campaign, or let her go, and feel it every time Judy gets quiet. It could also add weight to the Johnny-V debate, as one wanted chaos, and the other regrets it. Evelyn is the mirror, and therefore, her survival could be a tool to measure V’s empathy, foresight, and tactical decision-making, long before Hanako’s plan or the Aldecaldos even come into play.\nWith Evelyn alive, the game wouldn't just gain one more character - it would gain tension, divergence, and a payoff. She could reshape side gigs, disrupt faction hierarchies, and even alter the way Johnny sees V. All in all, saving this single broken woman could’ve grounded the storyline in something rarer even in Cyberpunk's Night City: hope with consequences.\nYour comment has not been saved\nCyberpunk 2077\n-\nOpenCritic Reviews - Top Critic Avg: 76/100 Critics Rec: 64%\n- Released\n- December 10, 2020\n- ESRB\n- M for Mature: Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Nudity, Strong Language, Strong Sexual Content, Use of Drugs and Alcohol\n- Developer(s)\n-\nCD Projekt Red - Publisher(s)\n-\nCD Projekt Red - Engine\n- REDengine 4\nCyberpunk 2077 is an open-world action-adventure from the creators of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, CD Projekt Red.\nSet in Night City, a megalopolis obsessed with power, glamour and body modification, you play as V, a mercenary outlaw going after a one-of-a-kind implant that is the key to immortality.\nUpgraded with next-gen in mind and featuring free additional content, customize your character and playstyle as you take on jobs, build a reputation, and unlock upgrades.\nThe relationships you forge and the choices you make will shape the story and the world around you.
