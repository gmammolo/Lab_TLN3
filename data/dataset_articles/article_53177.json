  "text": "IOWA CITY, Iowa — The cost of owning a pet is becoming increasingly burdensome, with lifetime expenses for a 10-year-old dog averaging $34,550 and a 16-year-old cat costing around $32,170, according to Forbes.\n\"The number was actually really mind-blowing to me,\" said Devon Strief, animal services coordinator at the Iowa City Animal Care and Adoption Center.\nThe financial strain is expected to worsen as President Donald Trump's tariffs take effect — raising concerns about a potential surge in pet surrenders at shelters like the Iowa City Animal Care and Adoption Center.\n\"They'll get them and take them home, and then they realize — wow, this is going to be a lot. And then those dogs end up in shelters,\" said Darlene Olshansky, a volunteer and pet trainer.\nShelters are already seeing the effects of economic pressure. Strief said the combination of tariffs, job losses, and housing insecurity is making it harder for families to afford basic pet care.\n\"They can't live without vet care, they can't live without food. And once we start adding more expenses to those, it's just going to create more problems for the community — for them to be able to keep their animals and give them their basic needs,\" she said.\nThe Iowa City Animal Care and Adoption Center urges potential pet owners to research the long-term costs before adopting.\n\"There are shelters and rescues everywhere that are just exploding with animals,\" Strief said. \"They don't have the cages or kennels to keep them in a humane way that's justifiable long term. It's not fair for the animals, and it's really hard for the employees.\"",
