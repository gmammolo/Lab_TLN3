  "text": "FRESNO, Calif. ( KSEE/KGPE ) – In an attempt to make more people “go vegan,” PETA officials announced they will bring “Hell on Wheels” to several eateries in Fresno, starting with Irene’s Café. On Tuesday, PETA announced it will make its way to Fresno eateries, especially those that serve pork, with its “Hell on Wheels” truck on Thursday afternoon, days after the same truck was spotted in Bakersfield. Per officials, Hell on Wheels is a “hyper-realistic pig transport truck that looks as if it contains real pigs on their way to slaughter.” The organization will “bombard” customers from various Fresno eateries with recorded sounds of animals’ “panicked screams” and messages suggesting people go vegan. One of the truck’s stops will be in front of Irene’s Café in the Tower District. YourCentralValley.com reached out to Irene’s Café for comment on this upcoming protest, to which they answered that their café serves people who “love their bacon and those that are vegetarian.” I definitely don’t want them in front of my business! I do know we serve those that love their bacon and those that are vegetarian! Adults can make up their own mind as to what they want to eat! Irene’s Café has been serving Fresno’s Tower District since 1991, and its website says they provide a “casual and tropical dining experience.” It is located at 747 E. Olive Ave. For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to CBS47 and KSEE24 | News from YourCentralValley.com.",
