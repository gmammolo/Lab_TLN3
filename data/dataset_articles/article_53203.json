  "text": "In yet another round of digital dress-code enforcement, Action Taimanin has announced that even more costumes are being axed from the Android version of the game due to violations of Google Play’s ever-mysterious “policy guidelines” – a move that’s become depressingly routine in the Western mobile market.\nThe Android version of Action Taimanin, a game once celebrated for blending action with unabashed fanservice, has been hit with another censorship wave. According to the developers, multiple costume sets will be permanently removed following a notice from Google Play claiming they violate platform policies.\nAmong the casualties are outfit lines such as “Nurse Call,” “Battle Scarred,” “Sleepover Ladies,” “Maid in Gosha,” “Bathrobe Series,” and “more” – with the list reading like a greatest hits of provocative pixel tailoring. In-game bundles like the “Luxury Room” and “Lightning Sonic” packages are also being discontinued ahead of schedule. Players are warned that the changes will take effect starting May 6th, 2025 at 02:00 UTC, and some content may already be replaced or partially missing from the Android store before then.\nThe iOS, Steam, and STOVE versions will remain untouched, but it should be noted that the iOS version is already exorbitantly censored, while the Steam version is fully uncensored.\nThe developers, in a statement that reads like a well-worn script by now, said they “fully respect” Google Play’s decisions and are exploring alternatives such as APK distribution and expanding into third-party markets – a polite way of saying they’re aware this is garbage, but would like to keep their app live. Players were also given a coupon code (MECV2JVQLV) as a kind of condolence prize for the digital wardrobe purge.\nThis isn’t new. Android censorship has been tightening for years now, but of course, the irony remains: a game where you decapitate demons in latex suits is fine – until someone shows too much sideboob.",
