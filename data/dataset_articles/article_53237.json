  "text": "Dead by dawn!\nEvil Dead The Game will soon be pulled from digital storefronts, Saber Interactive has today confirmed. The good news is, those that own it will still be able to play for the foreseeable future.\n“We can confirm we’ve begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts,” Saber wrote in a post on Steam. “Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone.\n“We want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support.”\nOne of many asynchronous horror clones to pop up after the success of Dead by Daylight, I didn’t mind Evil Dead back in my 2022 review.\n“It’s sometimes a little rough around the edges, but there are some amazing selling points when it comes to Evil Dead,” I wrote at the time. “It has the look, feel and sound of proceedings down pat, even down to the movement of the evil presence as it stalks Ash and his friends in the cold, dark woods.”\nIf you want to nab the game before it’s pulled, now is certainly the time — access links are below. Evil Dead The Game is currently available on Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, PS4, and PS5.\nThis article may contain affiliate links, meaning we could earn a small commission if you click-through and make a purchase.
