  "text": "A renovation can uncover exciting new problems you never knew you had. Credit: Ally Foster/Shutterstock\nHome renovation projects always start out in a rush of excitement—you're finally going to solve all those annoying problems, update those dated aspects of the house, and live the life you deserve! And sometimes it actually works out that way—but there are a lot of ways a renovation can go wrong. That's why nearly three-quarters of homeowners come to regret their renovations to some extent.\nMost of the reasons behind renovation regrets are pretty straightforward: Cost overruns, dissatisfaction with the final result, or shoddy work (either by contractors or DIY efforts) are the problems most people worry about when embarking on a renovation. But there are other, less obvious ways your renovation plans can backfire on you—problems that will only seem obvious in retrospect.\nI once innocently called my local utility company to come out and service my water heater, and ended the day with a dreaded \"red tag\" on my mechanical room—a paper notice that I had to bring something up to code. The worst part? The problem had nothing to do with my water heater, furnace, or anything else—it was the door to my mechanical room. When we renovated our house we had a new door hung, and it didn't have any ventilation built in. We passed city inspections after the reno, but now the utility company insisted I cut a louver into the door.\nIn another instance, a utility worker came by and noticed that our electrical panel was just in the wall. They informed me that there was a new requirement that panels be enclosed, so we had to build a fairly ridiculous box around the panel.\nThose are mild cases—it can be a lot worse. A nearby neighbor is renovating his house, and the utility company discovered that he shares a gas supply with his next-door neighbor, and that now has to be separated and re-routed despite the fact that neither of them have ever had a problem. The project is adding weeks to the renovation schedule and aggravating everyone involved. Often…\nJeff Somers",
