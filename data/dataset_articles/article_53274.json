However, he safeguarded himself by winning immunity. The castaways then plotted and deliberated on who to eliminate and Mary and Star's names came up. Ultimately the latter was sent home with 5 votes against her and became the 4th jury member of the season.\nAd Fans online reacted to Star's elimination and believed she was responsible for going home after she gave her immunity idol to Eva earlier in the season. One person wrote on X:\n\"She gave away an idol. Sad to see her go, but it’s her own fault.\" Expand Tweet Ad Trending \"\"Dealt a bad hand\" didn't she give away the idol to Eva who voted her off without a second thought. Star just wasn't a good player, and that's OK,\" a fan commented . \"I’ve been trying so hard to defend Eva all season but the way she talks about Star KILLS ME like girl she gave you her idol Why does that mean nothing to you???? You don’t have to be best friends but like nothing???! At all????!\" a tweet read . Ad Fans of Survivor season 48 commented on Star's time on the show:\n\"sad to see her go but I’m obsessed with Star not playing her shot in the dark honestly. she came to play SURVIVOR and respected the sanctity of tribal council by keeping her vote wow,\" a person wrote . \"Star was criminally under-edited and despite that still became a fan favorite. She was authentically genuine in expressing herself and played this game with a refusal to go with the flow that was infectious to watch. I’d love to see her get a second chance,\" a fan commented . Ad \"The way this cast ostracized Star right from the beginning never felt right with me. Eva voting Star out before 3 non alliance members after Star literally gave her an idol is just nasty. Star you deserved better than this cast,\" a tweet read . Fans of Survivor season 48 further said:\n\"Star clearly the best person on the season and I need an explanation ASAP for why the editors haven't been showing her and the other contestants talk about her the way they do....\" a person wrote . Ad \"We need to have a real discussion around why Star’s visibility was intentionally downplayed. She was clearly a magnetic presence on that island, but I guess it was more important for the editors to illustrate how blatantly obvious it is that Joe and Eva get to the end,\" a fan commented .",
