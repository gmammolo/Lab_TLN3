  "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — The Skylark Lounge, a cherished blues and soul venue in East Austin, announced it will permanently close its doors on Sunday, May 4, after 12 years of operation.\nFounded on the principles of honoring the heritage of East Austin, Skylark has been a stage for local blues and soul music legends, many in their 70s and 80s, ensuring their contributions and talents were celebrated.\nOver the years, these seasoned musicians have mentored the next generation, creating a welcoming space for everyone, regardless of race, gender, sexuality, or background.\nALSO| Missing bulldog found 1,000 miles away, reunited with family after four years\nOwners Johnny and Mary LaTouf have been instrumental in creating a venue that respects the rich musical traditions of East Austin.\nUnlike many closures in East Austin, Skylark's end isn't driven by gentrification or rising rents. The LaToufs, now in their 60s, say the decision is entirely personal. “We’re choosing to end this chapter with grace and gratitude,” they said in a joint statement.\nTo honor its legacy, Skylark Lounge is hosting a five-night farewell celebration starting Wednesday, April 30, and concluding with a performance by Soul Man Sam on Sunday, May 4.\nThe venue, located at 2039 Airport Blvd., will be open from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m., and all ages are welcome.",
