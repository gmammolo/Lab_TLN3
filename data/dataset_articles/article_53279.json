  "text": "Spanish locals are furious with overtourism in their country, but there's one real reason in particular why locals in two famous Spanish cities are at their wits' end with tourists, including the millions of Brits who visit every year. The main reason people are angry is because tourism in Spain is relentless due to its naturally warm climate, according to locals. It’s not just seasonally when the country is overtaken by tourists , instead, cities like Barcelona and Madrid attract visitors all-year round which keeps tourist numbers consistently high.",
