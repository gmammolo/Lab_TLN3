  "text": "Kool-Aid Man Viral Trend Is Back In New York Causing Residents A Lot Of Money\nDid you know that the fruit flavored drink Kool-Aid has been around since the 1920's? The brand's ambassador, Kool-Aid Man, started busting through walls in television commercials in the 1950's and in 2024 the band Bring Me The Horizon even released a song called 'Kool-Aid\".\nToday there is a, not-so-cool, 'Kool-Aid Man Tik-Tok Challenge, which popped up in New York a few years ago only to return in 2025. This challenge is when, mostly young, people literally run through a neighborhood fence like Kool-Aid Man would but causing real-life property damage.\nI recall watching Saturday morning cartoons and seeing Kool-Aid commercials showing a kid yell \"hey Kool-Aid\" and Kool-Aid Man would bust through the wall of a bowling alley, kid's bedroom, any wall really and say 'oh yeah\"!\nAccording to NBC New York the trend is back and busting through fences in New York State.\nA busted up fence is not insignificant. Fence pricing varies quite a bit depending on which materials are used, style of fence and how much yard are you fencing in. For an average half-acre property you could pay as much as $10,000 for a new fence.\nWhatever happened to kick the can, red light/green light or spirited game of tag?\nIf You Grew Up in the '70s and '80s, These Foods Were Super Fancy\nGallery Credit: Stephen Lenz\nTop 200 '70s Songs\nGallery Credit: UCR Staff\nLOOK: 79 of the Most 1970s Photos You've Ever Seen\nGallery Credit: Stephen Lenz",
