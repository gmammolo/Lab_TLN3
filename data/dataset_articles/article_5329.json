  "text": "In a move aimed at boosting morale and supporting employee well-being, Karnataka Director General of Police (DGP) M A Saleem has announced special casual leave for police personnel on their birthdays and wedding anniversaries. The decision has been welcomed across the force as a progressive step toward improving work-life balance.\nAn official order issued by the DGP states that police officers and staff will now be eligible to avail casual leave on these important personal occasions. The initiative is intended to recognise the demanding nature of police service, where personnel often work long hours under high-pressure conditions, frequently missing family events and personal milestones.\nSenior officials said the decision reflects the departmentâ€™s acknowledgment of the mental and emotional strain faced by police personnel. By allowing time off on special days, the leadership hopes to reduce stress, enhance motivation and foster a more supportive work environment.\nKarnataka BJP Woman Worker 'Stripped', 'Assaulted' By Cops During Arrest In Huballi, Police Deny...\nThe order clarifies that the benefit will be granted within existing casual leave provisions and does not require the creation of a new leave category. Instructions have been circulated to all police units across the state to ensure smooth implementation of the policy.\nOfficials believe the initiative will not only improve morale but also contribute to better job satisfaction and productivity within the force. The step is being seen as part of a broader effort to prioritise the welfare of police personnel and promote a healthier balance between professional duties and personal life.",
