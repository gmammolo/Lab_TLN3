  "text": "Production for the 2025 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1, one of the most anticipated vehicles in American history, is expected to begin as early as next week. The Chevrolet Corvette Plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky, has been making other versions of the C8, but the ZR1 has been delayed because of supply chain issues. Now, there is word that buyers are being sent letters telling them that Corvette will not tolerate anyone buying the supercar just to flip it. Corvette is threatening to void the vehicle’s warranty if it is sold within the first year and the seller will be banned from ever buying another Corvette.\nCorvette Means Business\nAll Corvettes are high-demand vehicles but the ZR1 is truly special. As I have reported previously, General Motors President Mark Reuss drove the ZR1, in Germany, setting the top speed of 233 mph. The 1,064-horsepower beauty does 0-60 in an astonishing 2.3 seconds. That makes the ZR1 the fastest street legal car ever produced by a North American automaker.\nChevrolet confirms that the 2025 Corvette ZR1 equipped with the ZTK Performance Package can reach new records, running the quarter mile in 9.6 seconds. Based on these figures, no current production car under $1 million rivals the Corvette ZR1.\nThe 2025 Corvette ZR1’s quick performance is enabled by Corvette’s standard Launch Control and Custom Launch Control features, found throughout the lineup from Stingray to ZR1. Launch Control is programmed to manage tire spin and transmission clutch application rate. Custom Launch Control allows the driver to have more control to adjust for real-time conditions, optimizing acceleration runs by adjusting launch RPM and wheel slip targets from the steering wheel controls.\nC8 Versions and 0-60 Comparison Numbers\n- Stingray with available Z51 package: 2.9 seconds\n- Z06 with available Z07 package: 2.6 seconds\n- E-Ray: 2.5 seconds\n- ZR1 with available ZTK package: 2.3 seconds\nNew Record-Setting Lap Times at Different Tracks\nChevrolet wants to make sure that people understand the recently set records are not one-off circumstances. So, Chevy took the Corvette ZR1 to several different tracks and set new lap times at each of the tracks. Chevy even used four different drivers to drive home the point that the ZR1 is an extraordinary vehicle. With four different professional General Motors drivers behind the wheel, the Corvette ZR1 has set five new production car lap records during a U.S. track tour.\nAccording to Chevrolet, these are the five tracks and the Corvette ZR1’s lap times, each with a GM driver at the wheel:\n- Watkins Glen Long Course: 1:52.7. Driver: Bill Wise, Lead Performance Engineer, Chassis Controls.\n- Road America: 2:08.6. Driver: Brian Wallace, Lead Vehicle Dynamics Engineer.\n- Road Atlanta: 1:22.8. Driver: Chris Barber, Lead Development Engineer.\n- Virginia International Raceway Full Course: 1:47.7. Driver: Aaron Link, Global Vehicle Performance Manager.\n- Virginia International Raceway Grand Course: 2:32.3. Driver: Aaron Link.\nRecords Set with Pre-Production ZR1\nThe Corvette ZR1 used to set the records is equipped with the optional ZTK Performance Package. The ZTK Package notably adds an aggressive, high-downforce rear wing, front dive planes, and a tall hood Gurney lip – all constructed from woven carbon fiber. Underbody strakes replace the standard front underwing, to substantially increase front downforce. The suspension tuning included in the ZTK package incorporates stiffer springs and adds Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R ZP tires.\n“Corvette ZR1 continues to showcase how this nameplate elevates at every corner,” Corvette executive chief engineer Tony Roma said. “From design, engineering, development, validation, to driving and setting incredible lap records like these – we do it all in house.”\nThe 2025 Corvette ZR1 Key Performance Details\n- It has a 5.5L, twin-turbocharged LT7 DOHC flat-plane crank V8 engine\n- 1,064 horsepower at 7,000 rpm\n- 828 lb.-ft. of torque at 6,000 rpm\n- The most power ever from a factory Corvette\n- The most powerful V8 ever produced in America from an auto manufacturer\n- The fastest car ever built by an American auto manufacturer, capable of 233 mph\n- Carbon fiber aero package creating over 1,200 pounds of downforce at top speed\nThe incredible performance and high demand is why Corvette is setting special rules about anyone trying to make a quick buck by selling the highly coveted Corvette. The ZR1 is a collector’s vehicle. It is unlikely that you will see many of them on the streets. Most will be locked away. Some very wealthy people may actually drive theirs. Corvette wants to make sure the people who buy them really want the supercar, not just the profit. If you are lucky enough to land one of the special beauties, be prepared to keep it for at least a year. If the sports car is sold too quickly, the person buying the Corvette will be punished as well. The quick sale will void the ZR1’s warranty, which could really become very expensive.\nIt is not unheard of for automakers to set restrictions on sales. When Ford sold its GT supercar, buyers had to sign contracts promising not to sell them within two years. Buyers also had to agree to allow Ford to show off the vehicles in certain events.\nThe MSRP for the Corvette ZR1 starts at $174,995 for the 1LZ coupe and $184,995 for the 1LZ hardtop convertible. Those prices include destination charges. However, individual dealers will set the final prices.\nChevrolet Photo\nMary Conway is a professional automotive journalist and has decades of experience specializing in automotive news analysis.
