  "text": "PETA demands MrBeast ‘leave animals alone’ as YouTuber plots 100 men vs Gorilla video by Michael Gwilliam Published: Apr 30, 2025, 21:55\nSave for later\nSave for later Dexerto/MrBeast PETA is calling out MrBeast after the YouTuber humorously requested volunteers for a video to solve the viral 100 men vs a Gorilla question.\nIn late April, the internet became infatuated with a simple, yet humorous viral hypothetical: could 100 men work together to defeat a single Gorilla?\nThis question resulted in widespread discussion, simulations, experts weighing in and content creators drafting their “dream teams” in a battle against a gorilla.\nAmid the height of the question, Jimmy ‘ MrBeast ’ Donaldson revealed he needed 100 men to volunteer to make the battle a reality – something that got the attention of Elon Musk and IShowSpeed .\nArticle continues after ad The video also caught the eye of activist group PETA, who called out the world’s most-subscribed YouTuber in a series of posts.\nPETA urges MrBeast not to “exploit” animals for 100 men vs Gorilla video PETA responded to MrBeast’s tweet about the viral debate, furious at his joke about making a potential video to test out the situation in real life.\nArticle continues after ad “100 men vs. a gorilla? Maybe try 100 reasons to leave animals out of your content instead,” they blasted. “We love to have fun — just leave animals out of it.”\nArticle continues after ad\n100 men vs. a gorilla? Maybe try 100 reasons to leave animals out of your content instead…\n— PETA (@peta) April 28, 2025 When another user responded by saying the video would be fun for the animals, the group fired back: “Exploiting animals isn’t fun for them. Let’s give them the freedom to enjoy real fun: in their natural habitats, where they belong.”\nExploiting animals isn't fun for them 👎 Let's give them the freedom to enjoy real fun: in their natural habitats, where they belong 💯\n— PETA (@peta) April 29, 2025 PETA further encouraged MrBeast to move away from the gorilla video in favor of helping bulls in India, instead.\n“Want to prove real strength, MrBeast?” they asked. “Ditch the gorilla fight and help retire bulls forced to haul tons of sugarcane in scorching heat by replacing them with tractors.”\nArticle continues after ad\nWant to prove real strength, @MrBeast ?\nDitch the gorilla fight and help retire bulls forced to haul tons of sugarcane in scorching heat by replacing them with tractors 🐂🚜 pic.twitter.com/sMHsHNKydw\n— PETA (@peta) April 29, 2025 Funnily enough, MrBeast isn’t one to shy away from philanthropic work, and has done quite a lot for charity like planting 20M trees , curing 1,000 people’s blindness and removing millions of pounds of trash from the ocean.\nArticle continues after ad Thus far, Donaldson hasn’t responded to PETA – but it’s also not like he was actually planning on having 100 people fight a real gorilla, given the legal and moral issues with such a concept.\nIt’s not clear exactly what MrBeast has in store for this gorilla content, or if PETA will continue to call him out, regardless of what video he ends up making.\nArticle continues after ad PETA, meanwhile, has a history of calling out hot topics to promote its own agenda.\nDuring the height of Palworld’s popularity, the organization accused the game of promoting animal cruelty and suggested a vegan guide for the game.\nkeep reading Related Topics Mrbeast",
