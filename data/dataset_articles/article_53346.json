  "text": "Reality TV shows like Married At First Sight and the Bachelor give an image of romantic perfection. However, that’s not always the case.\nIn March of this year, a contestant on Married At First Sight was being investigated by New South Wales police for coercive control and domestic violence towards his partner, and before the season began, another contestant was revealed to have previous charges of domestic violence.\nWhile the show tried to make it clear that this was not acceptable, both men were still allowed to stay. What does this teach both men and women? And how can we improve our response to domestic violence?\nOn the Thursday Daily, we chatted with Dr Kate Toone, Lecturer of Social Work at the University of South Australia, about how the show presented domestic violence and how we can change this presentation for both men and women.\nIf you are dealing with domestic violence call 1800-RESPECT (1800-737-732)",
