  "text": "After 20 years, Cube Nightclub, which helped define Canberra's nightlife and LGBTQIA+ culture, is closing its doors. It's the final countdown for Cube Nightclub in Canberra, which will close its doors at the end of 2025. \\\"Hospitality in Canberra is probably at its worst point in my time,\\\" Venue manager and drag queen Seth Byrnes told Canberra Times. \\\"People don't have the money to spend on going out as much.\\\" \\\"It's stuff out of our control, cost-of-living crisis, the work's going on in the light rail, a combination of things.\\\" Taking to social media this week, the announcement that \\\"the final season of Cube is here\\\" \\\"After 20 unforgettable years, Cube Nightclub will be closing its doors at the end of this year,\\\" they said on Instagram. \\\"This isn\\u2019t just a farewell to a venue, it\\u2019s the close of an era that helped define Canberra\\u2019s nightlife and LGBTQIA+ culture.\\\" \\\"For over two decades, Cube has been more than a club, it\\u2019s been a sanctuary, a celebration, and a second home. \\\"From the artists to the staff, the drag royalty to the DJs, the lovers, the misfits, the first-timers and the faithful regulars, \\\"Every one of you shaped what Cube became. \\\"Together, we created something unforgettable.\\\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Cube Nightclub (@cubecanberra) 'Cube's a gay nightclub and if you don't like it, F&^K off!' Attending Cube for 17 years, Douglas Robinson shared some of his thoughts and memories about the club. \\\"Cube's a gay nightclub and if you don't like it, F&^K off!\\\" \\\"More than anything else, I remember Morris, the former owner of Cube, saying these words over the microphone, \\\"Every single weekend, I was clubbing in my teens and early twenties. \\\"With Cube being the only gay Nightclub in the city and really the only safe space at that time. \\\"Hearing those words was a reassurance that this place was a home. \\\"I've spent time at Cube as a patron, a drag queen, and a photographer. \\\"Have met people I've lived with, people I've dated and lifelong friends. \\\"Have seen more drag queens and performers grace the stage, \\\"From the local, to interstate, to international drag race stars, then I could think to count or name. \\\"I remember the legendary theme nights and people dressing up to win costume contests and prizes, \\\"And the club being so full, the line extended down the block. \\\"Cube is a club older than the new queers experiencing it for the first time. \\\"That's an incredible legacy for a venue. \\\"My visits get less as I get older, but I wouldn't change a thing about the memories and experiences I've had there over the years.\\\" Source: Douglas Robinson A LGBTQ+ haven for many over the years Cube is one of the oldest clubs in Canberra and one of the only gay and lesbian venues in the capital for many years. The venue was a haven for many when it opened. \\\"There were less venues that were welcoming of being queer,\\\" Byrne said, \\\"Now, fortunately, being gay is a bit more of an open thing, and people are a lot more comfortable with it.\\\" \\\"Cube used to be that one-off safe space compared to what else was available in the city.\\\" Many took to social media, sharing memories of Cube when hearing the news. \\\"I always felt safe there to be ourselves & was treated like family.\\\" posted Kaya McKay, who also worked the door for a while. \\\"Cube was the first gay bar I ever went to, and in a roundabout way, it helped me out of the closet.\\\" Damien Victorsen wrote, \\\"Party nights at Cube helped me find my way to the amazing LGBTIQ+ community in New York City, where I now live.\\\" Nadine Howton, who ran Cube from 2006 to 2012, responded to the announcement. \\\"I am devastated to hear this.\\\" \\\"This is our safe space, our baby we grew from the ground up.\\\" \\\"So many memories! I met my wife there!! \\\"As Morris just said to me, they can take our club, but they can\\u2019t take our memories!! \\\"All my cube family - let\\u2019s organise a 'last dance' and see the old gal off as she deserves!\\\" Photo by Douglas Robinson Let's give Cube the send-off it deserves. Byrne cited rising hospitality costs, declining drink sales, light rail works and changes in habits that led to the decision. Like many venues across the country, COVID lockdowns have played a factor in changes to patron attendance. Young people missed out on their first clubbing experiences while older and regular patrons got out of the habit. What was a part of people's weekly routine and connection has now changed. But though things have changed over the years, Byrnes says the heart of Cube lives on. \\\"The pureness of Cube is that if you still go to a dance floor on a Saturday night,\\\" \\\"There are still not that many phones and stuff out.\\\" \\\"It's still people having fun and being in the moment.\\\" Byrnes is working hard to make the final months of Cube a celebration of its iconic 20 years. \\\"Bringing back a lot of performers, a lot of drags,\\\" \\\"A lot of obscure dancing kind of things that Cube can have in here,\\\" \\\"Some old staff members, some people who just made the place feel like a community at home,\\\" he said. As Cube prepares to say goodbye at the end of the year, they have promised not to go quietly. \\\"In the months ahead, we\\u2019ll be revisiting some of Cube\\u2019s most iconic events,\\\" they said on Instagram. \\\"Bringing back the energy, the sparkle, and the community that made it all so special.\\\" \\\"With a stacked lineup of our favourite DJs, drag performers, and creators, we\\u2019ll be celebrating the legacy of Cube, \\\"Loud, proud, and together. \\\"Let\\u2019s give Cube the send-off it deserves.\\\" Photos by Douglas Robinson For the latest LGBTIQA+\\u00a0Sister Girl and Brother Boy\\u00a0news,\\u00a0entertainment,\\u00a0community stories\\u00a0in Australia, visit\\u00a0qnews.com.au.
