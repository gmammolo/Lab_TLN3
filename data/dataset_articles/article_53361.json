  "text": "Bollywood actors walking ramps for big designers has been a thing, but recently, the new addition to these walks has been the celebs stopping mid-way to greet someone or the other. While a video of Nitanshi Goel greeting Hema Malini went viral on social media, fashion content creator Ishita Mangal took to her Instagram to slam actors for disrespecting the designers and misunderstanding fashion shows for sangeet ceremonies. The creator took to her social media and dropped a video compilation featuring Ranveer Singh stopping mid-way to kiss wife Deepika, Sidharth Malhotra reaching Zeenat Aman to greet her, and Nitanshi Goel taking blessings from Hema Malini all this while these actors walked the ramp for designers. Ishita Mangal calls out Bollywood celebs While calling out this unusual trend in Bollywood, Ishita said, I am officially done with Indian actors using fashion shows as family reunions. Whats with the blessing tour mid-ramp walk? Touching feet, meet and greet, casual chit-chats. I am confused. Are we at a sangeet or a fashion show? Respect and acknowledgement are great, but maybe showcase culture or values before or after the event. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ishita Mangal (@ishitamangal) The fashion influencer further continued and said, Designers pay big money for these events. Stylists, choreographers, models, media people – they are all running on a tight timeline. Most of them have another show to run to after it. This isnt just about disrespecting the designers vision, it is about wasting everyones time, including the audience. She further called out their attention-seeking behaviour and said, We love our actors and the stardom that they have built, but the only star on a runway show is a designer. The designer concluded her reel by saying, You wouldnt randomly start touching peoples feet in the middle of a movie scene, right? Well, this is a one-take shot. So stop this attention-seeking behaviour. Netizens reaction to the post As Ishita dropped this reel, several social media users dropped comments supporting her thoughts. One wrote, Also, I think its high time that they should hire an actual model rather than any actor. Like let them do their job and you do your job. Seriously, very unprofessional when they do it mid-runway, another user commented. While a third one said, Thank you for saying it out loud!",
