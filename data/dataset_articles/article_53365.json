  "text": "Carrie Underwood has returned to American Idol as a judge, marking a full-circle moment 20 years after winning the competition. Joining fellow judges Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan , Underwood brings a unique perspective, having experienced the show’s transformative journey from contestant to country music superstar. Unfortunately, some fans watching American Idol Season 23 don’t love one of Underwood’s judging habits. Here’s why viewers find her annoying.\n‘American Idol’ Season 23 judge Carrie Underwood annoys fans with 1 habit Carrie Underwood went on to become one of the most successful American Idol winners. She’s renowned throughout the country music world for her incredible voice and poignant lyrics. Now, she’s taking the reality TV singing competition world by storm as the new judge for American Idol Season 23 .\nShowrunner Megan Michaels Wolflick told TheWrap that “all roads led to Carrie” when deciding who would replace Katy Perry . “It just made so much sense to put [Carrie] in there, because she was bringing something new to the table that we never had before,” Michaels Wolflick said. “That firsthand experience is something that any other judge who’s ever been on the show can talk for years about what it’s like to stand on the oval, though they don’t know.”\nFans were excited to see Underwood back on the show that gave her monumental fame. However, some viewers aren’t happy with one of Underwood’s habits. Underwood often sings along with the contestants during their songs, and some fans find that her voice can be overpowering.\n“I do think Carrie is a good addition …,” one fan wrote on Reddit , “but I can’t stand how she sings along with the songs. I think if I were the contestant, that would throw me off to see her lip syncing right back at me.”\nAnother fan agreed. “I don’t mind it now during the performances because at least there’s a band,” they commented. “It was annoying during auditions because at times she was singing louder than the contestants.”\nOther viewers think the contestants should grow accustomed to watching others sing along to their songs if they want to perform for a living.\n“I feel like, if I were a contestant, I would feel better looking out to the crowd and seeing her having fun, singing along, and rocking out to my performance than looking out and seeing the judges looking serious and unmoved,” a fan countered.\nSome viewers think Carrie Underwood puts the focus back on the contestants American Idol viewers had divided opinions on Katy Perry as a judge. Perry wasn’t scared to express herself to the fullest, often making a public spectacle on the show. However, in American Idol Season 23, Carrie Underwood has all of her attention on the contestants, and she allows Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie to shine alongside her.\n“Carrie gives her full attention to the contestants while Katy was thinking about how to make it about herself,” a fan on Reddit said.\n“I agree, and I do love Katy, but I almost feel like with Carrie, we are also seeing more of Luke and Lionel’s personalities this season, too,” another fan noted. “Katy was kind of front and center, and now, it feels like the judges are more evenly spread out.”\nLionel Richie and Luke Bryan seem to enjoy the country singer as an ‘American Idol’ judge Related Carrie Underwood Appeared ‘Tense’ and ‘Serious’ While Filming ‘American Idol,’ Source Says\nAmerican Idol Season 23 fans were curious to see the dynamic between Lionel Richie, Luke Bryan, and Carrie Underwood. Katy Perry commanded the most attention as a judge. While Richie and Bryan loved Perry’s eccentric behavior, they also adore Underwood, even giving her the nickname “Jukebox Carrie” thanks to her ability to know and sing any song.\n“It’s amazing what she has up in that little jukebox head of hers,” Richie said. “I have never met anyone like that.”\nHowever, Richie does have one complaint about Underwood. While on Good Morning America , he claimed Underwood is “too nice” to the contestants. “She’s always saying, ‘But he’s so cute,'” he added.\nFor more news and exclusive interviews, follow Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s Instagram .",
