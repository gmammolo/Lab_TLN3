  "text": "I've got a 60GB memory phone pushing six years and been running out of memory for at least 2 of those.\nI bought a tablet with 32 gigs and an SD card with an additional 500.\nI want to keep my images and files so I turned on back up which filled up almost instantly. It's threatening my Gmail so I'm trying to make room.\nI downloaded a batch of a few test images to my SD card for the time being, when I go to cloud backup/images and delete the just copied images...it deleted them from the SD card, before I restored them.\nThere is no option to move them from backup to hardware. Only move to archive or a locked folder.\nI want to move stuff from the cloud to an SD card before I find somewhere else for it later. Can I really not do this?\nI bought a tablet with 32 gigs and an SD card with an additional 500.\nI want to keep my images and files so I turned on back up which filled up almost instantly.
