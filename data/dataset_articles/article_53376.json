  "text": "Katy Perry is responding to her role as the internet’s latest punching bag .\nOn Monday, the pop star took to Instagram to share how recent criticism of her Blue Origin space flight and her Lifetimes tour has affected her. In an comment responding to a supportive Times Square billboard paid for by fans, Perry said that the barrage of hate left her feeling “battered and bruised” but that she remained thankful for her loyal followers.\nKaty Perry feels like ‘a human piñata’ Related Katy Perry ‘Regrets’ ‘Kissing the Ground’ After Blue Origin Flight, Source Says\n“I’m so grateful for you guys. We’re in this beautiful and wild journey together,” she wrote, before going on to assure people that she was coping as best as she could with the latest spate of negative publicity.\n“Please know I am ok, I have done a lot work around knowing who I am, what is real and what is important to me,” she wrote.\n“When the ‘online’ world tries to make me a human Piñata, I take it with grace and send them love, cause I know so many people are hurting in so many ways and the internet is very much so a dumping ground for unhinged and unhealed,” she continued. “What’s real is seeing your faces every night, singing in unison, reading your notes, feeling your warmth. I find people to lock eyes and sing with and I know we are healing each other in a small way when I get to do that.”\nKaty Perry’s space flight described as ‘beyond parody’ On April 14, Perry was part of the Blue Origin’s first all-female flight crew. The 10-minute trip to space was widely criticized online as an expensive publicity stunt with little real-world value. Photos of Perry kissing the ground after she returned to Earth following the brief flight made Perry the subject of mockery. Even some fellow celebs – as well as fast-food chain Wendy’s – took potshots at the singer.\n“Billion dollars bought some good memes, I guess,” actor and director Olivia Wilde wrote when she shared the photo of Perry post-flight on her Instagram Story.\nActor and model Emily Ratajkowski also expressed her disgust for the trip, which also included Gayle King and Lauren Sanchez, the girlfriend of Blue Origin’s billionaire founder Jeff Bezos.\n“This is beyond parody,” Ratajkowski said in a TikTok video. “Saying that you care about mother Earth and it’s about mother Earth, and you’re going up in a space ship that is built and paid for by a company that’s single-handedly destroying the planet — look at the state of the world and think about how many resources went into putting these women into space. For what? For what? What was the marketing there? And then to try to make it — like I’m disgusted, literally, I’m disgusted.”\nMeanwhile, Perry’s Lifetimes tour has gotten off to a rocky start, with some criticizing lackluster choreography and visuals that appear to have been created with AI. Ticket sales for U.S. dates on the tour have reportedly been slow . Her 2024 comeback album 143 also received mixed reviews and generated poor sales, with Perry also being criticized for working with controversial producer Dr. Luke, who has been accused of sexual harassment by singer Kesha.\nFor more news and exclusive interviews, follow Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s Instagram .",
