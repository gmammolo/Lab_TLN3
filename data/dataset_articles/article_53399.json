  "text": "Ye Says Fans Who Call Kendrick Lamar One of Their Favorite Rappers 'Don't Know About Rap'\nThe disgraced rapper also expressed his hatred for J. Cole's music in his latest rant.\nYe, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, continues to go out sad, seemingly fishing for a response from Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole by publicly criticizing their music.\nIn his latest attention-seeking attempt, Ye questioned why Drake has collaborated with Cole before stating people should not tell him that they are a fan of the Fayetteville rapper's music. \"I hate J. Cole,\" he said. \"It can't even be called music. I hate J. Cole.\"\nYe then turned his attention to the Compton native who appeared on The Life of Pablo track \"No More Parties in LA.\"\n\"And it's something about both J. Cole and Kendrick that kinda, that leaves me sorta like—it reminds me of each other and shit like that,\" he said alongside Toronto artist Top5. \"It's just not that sauce to me.\"\nYe also took issue with Ben Affleck putting Kendrick on his Mount Rushmore of rappers on Complex's GOAT Talk with Jon Bernthal.\n\"Anybody that say Kendrick is one of their favorite rappers, don't know about rap, doesn't know about real rap,\" Ye said.\nThis is far from the first time that Kendrick has been caught in the 47-year-old rapper's crosshairs. Ye called Lamar and Tyler, the Creator the \"two most overrated so-called artist\" last week, claiming the former \"cannot rap\" and \"doesn’t have one bar where I say I wish I said that.\"\nPrior to that, Ye, who was dressed in black Ku Klux Klan-style attire, told Akademiks that Kendrick has \"no hits.\"\nThe artist formerly known as Kanye West has expressed his hatred for Cole's music in the past as well.",
