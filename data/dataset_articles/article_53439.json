  "text": "Brittany Cartwright is opening up about her ex-husband Jax Taylor’s performance in the bedroom – and it’s not exactly flattering. During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Brittany didn’t hold back when asked to rate Jax’s skills on a scale from 1 to 10.\n“Oh, Lord. There was times when he was about a 7 or an 8, but majority of the time, no stamina, no nothing,” Brittany, 36, candidly revealed. But she didn’t stop there, going on to give a more direct final rating: “I’d say, a 2 or 3.”\nThe former couple, who were married for five years and share a four-year-old son, Cruz, separated in January 2024, with Brittany filing for divorce in August of the same year. Despite their split, Brittany and Jax continue to co-parent, and according to her, their relationship is still “not great.”\nThe reality star went on to address Jax’s struggles with mental health and addiction. In recent months, Jax has shared that he’s been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and PTSD, and has been battling addiction issues. He recently celebrated 83 days of sobriety. However, Brittany remains cautious, saying she can’t fully trust that he’s sober.\n“I really hope that he is sober, I can’t say 100% that I think that he is or not,” Brittany confessed. “His personality is very much a Jax Taylor personality, so there’s a lot of ups and downs.”\nWhile their romantic relationship is definitively over, Brittany emphasized the importance of co-parenting for the sake of their son. “Me and Cruz both deserve that. No matter what, me and Jax are not getting back together, but we’re going to be in each other’s lives and coparenting is the most important thing and Cruz deserves the most.”\nReflecting on her time with Jax, Brittany also pointed to a major red flag she missed early on: how he treated others. “How he treated waiters and people in general,” she shared, indicating that it was a sign of things to come.",
