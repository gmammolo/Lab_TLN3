  "text": "Key stat: 95% of women characters in US ads are portrayed in domestic and family roles, while only 3% are in leadership roles, according to a March 2025 CreativeX report. In worldwide ads, 71% of women characters are portrayed in domestic roles and 20% in leadership roles.\nBeyond the chart:\nOnly a third of all pharmaceutical and healthcare advertising accurately portrays women, who are key decision makers in 80% of healthcare choices, according to a 2024 report from The Association of National Advertisers’ SeeHer initiative. Ads with positive female representation see a 20% lift in choice intent, according to an Ipsos report. Women will control 75% of discretionary spending by 2028, Nielsen projects. Use this chart: Marketers can use this chart to consider more ways to feature women in their campaigns, better reflecting the diversity of their roles.\nRelated EMARKETER reports:\nHow Consumers Perceive Ads (EMARKETER subscription required) US Mothers 2024 (EMARKETER subscription required) Methodology: Data is from the March 2025 CreativeX \"Gender in Advertising Report 2025.\" 940,000 advertising assets from 1,195 brands in 159 markets used in 2024 were analyzed in 2025.",
