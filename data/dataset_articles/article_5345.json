  "text": "Pay back the money: SIU recovers R1.7bn in NSFAS funds\nThe SIU has recovered R1.7 billion in improperly held NSFAS funds from universities, TVET colleges and unqualified students.\nThe Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has recovered R1.7 billion and returned it to the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS), following investigations into funds paid to institutions and students who did not qualify.\nThe announcement was made on Tuesday, 27 January, as students across South Africa began registering for the 2026 academic year.\nSIU recovers more than R2 billion\nThe recovered funds form part of more than R2 billion the SIU has clawed back so far.\nAccording to the SIU, the money relates to unallocated NSFAS funds from 2016 to 2021. These were funds originally meant for qualifying students who later changed institutions or deregistered.\nWhile universities and colleges are allowed to hold these funds for up to one year, many kept the money for far longer, which triggered recovery action.\nThe SIU said the problem was worsened by weak control systems and poor reconciliation processes at NSFAS during that period.\nPayments from institutions and students\nA significant portion of the money was recovered from universities, TVET colleges and unqualified students.\nSome of the largest repayments came from:\n- University of the Witwatersrand – R450 million\n- University of the Free State – R438 million (plus a second payment of R69.7 million)\n- University of Pretoria – R400 million\n- University of Fort Hare – R277.6 million\nThe SIU also recovered R126 million from unqualified students and parents, who have signed acknowledgements of debt and agreed to repay the money over time.\nThe unit urged anyone who received NSFAS funding without qualifying to come forward and make repayment arrangements.\nIn other news, NSFAS has confirmed that it has finalised all 2026 funding applications, approving 609 653 students and rejecting 49 538 after review.\nThe scheme received a record 893 847 applications, with the majority coming from first-time university entrants and female applicants.",
