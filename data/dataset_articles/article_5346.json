  "text": "Dorset police recognised at national level for work tackling violence against women and girls\nThe force received awards in two categories\nDorset Police has received national recognition for two initiatives aimed at addressing violence against women and girls (VAWG).\nThe awards were presented at the National Centre for Violence Against Women and Girls and Public Protection (NCVPP) annual event, which celebrates outstanding efforts across policing.\nThe winning initiative was the Force's Survivors Network, which provides support for officers and staff affected by domestic abuse, sexual harassment and other forms of violence against women and girls.\nThe network was designed with input from survivors to ensure dignity, equity and justice are embedded within the organisational culture, offering a confidential and trauma-informed safe space for staff to be heard.\nThe other award went to the Pineapple Project, a partnership with Dorset Council that launched in Weymouth in 2022.\nThe scheme established a network of trained Community Guardians, made up of local businesses and volunteers, to provide safe spaces for girls and young women.\nThe project now has more than 60 guardians who help to foster a culture of active upstanders and collective responsibility.\nIt was recognised for its combination of ‘community empowerment, education and partnership working’.\nDetective Superintendent Neil Wright, Dorset Police’s operational lead for VAWG, said: “We are committed as a force to demonstrate that we are here for the safety of women and girls.\n“As well as working to support victims and tackling VAWG-related crime, these two vital projects show that we are also focussing internally on providing support to our own staff as well as working with partners to offer spaces in our communities where women and girls can feel safe.”\nThe two finalists were selected from more than 75 entries by a panel that included judges from the specialist sector and academic experts.\nAll winning entries had to demonstrate how they built innovation into their activity, how their approach was victim-centred and the impact it has had, and will continue to have, in tackling violence against women and girls and keeping the public safe.\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Millichap, director of the NCVPP, said: “It’s been an honour to award these brilliant police officers, staff, volunteers and partners today. Hearing the inspirational citations about their work, which tackles violence against women and girls and protects the public, reminds us all of the importance of the task we are undertaking and the great work that is already happening across the country that we can build on.”\nJess Phillips, Minister for Safeguarding and Violence against Women and Girls, added: “A woman is killed by a man on average every three days in the UK. That’s why the work of the police is so vital to tackle abusers and protect victims from harm.\n“These awards celebrate officers who refuse to look away from that reality, so thank you to all those officers who dedicate their lives to protecting the public.",
  "summary": "The awards were presented at the National Centre for Violence Against Women and Girls and Public Protection (NCVPP) annual event, which celebrates outstanding efforts across policing. The winning initiative was the Force's Survivors Network, which provides support for officers and staff affected by domestic abuse, sexual harassment and other forms of violence against women and girls. The network was designed with input from survivors to ensure dignity, equity and justice are embedded within the organisational culture, offering a confidential and trauma-informed safe space for staff to be heard.",
