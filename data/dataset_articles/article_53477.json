  "text": "India’s Only Premium Economy: Air India Rolls Out New 3-Class Seating After Backlash Over Broken Chairs\nAir India plans to complete upgrades of its 27 A320neo aircraft by the third quarter of 2025.\nAir India has announced that more than 50 percent of its aircraft now have brand-new interiors, as part of a $400 million cabin upgrade programme.\nThis is part of a larger five-year plan to improve the flying experience on both narrow-body and wide-body aircraft. The airline is giving its older planes a fresh lease of life while waiting for new jets to be delivered.\nRecommended Stories\nWhat’s New? Business, Premium Economy & Refreshed Economy Class\nThe new design features a three-class seating layout:\n- Business Class\n- India’s only Premium Economy\n- Revamped Economy Class\nOther upgrades include brand-new carpets, curtains, lavatories, and aircraft painted in the refreshed Air India branding.\nCEO Calls Retrofit Top Priority\nSpeaking at the Skift India Forum in March, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson described aircraft retrofit as the “number one priority\". All older wide-body aircraft like the Boeing 777s and 787s are expected to be fully refurbished by early to mid-2027.\n“It’s taking longer than we hoped,\" Wilson admitted, blaming seat shortages and logistics issues, as per Economic Times.\nThe airline has also started upgrading its A320neo aircraft. All 27 A320neos are expected to be refurbished by the third quarter of this year. The first of these has already returned to service.\nMeanwhile, Vistara aircraft—following the merger with Air India will also be repainted and revamped. That process is likely to take another 18 months.\nSeat Troubles: The Broken Chair Row\nThe new seating arrangement comes after a series of seat-related controversies that Air India has faced, including backlash over broken chairs on some of its flights.\nFurthermore, this issue stirred public discontent, leading to the introduction of the ‘3-Class’ seating system in an effort to improve passenger satisfaction.\nOne viral incident involved former Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who was seen struggling with a damaged business class seat, as per The Hindu.\nThere have also been other complaints about torn upholstery, loose armrests, and malfunctioning recliners—causing major embarrassment for India’s national carrier.\nGlobal Aviation Faces Seat Shortage\nWilson also pointed to a global supply crunch, saying airlines around the world are facing delays in getting aircraft parts, including seats, engines, and other components, as per Economic Times.\nIndia— including reviews, prices, specs, and performance.
