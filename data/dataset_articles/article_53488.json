  "text": "Paramount+ recently went through a slight shakeup, and many are reacting on social media over the mini-change. It was announced that the streaming platform would keep six of its shows, and only axe one this year. One of the shows that made the cut was the Dexter prequel series, Dexter: Original Sin , which debuted in December 2024. Ironically, many Dexter fans weren’t impressed with the show’s first season, and found it to be underwhelming to say the least. On X, formerly Twitter, several Dexter fans admitted their issues with Dexter: Original Sin and their disinterest in the show’s upcoming Season 2.

Please make this more ‘serious’ like New Blood, and less flimsy, awkward & cheap like Original Sin. Another explained, “Dexter: New Blood and Dexter: Original Sin were a bit of a let down…” Despite many not being a fan of the Dexter spinoff, some couldn’t get enough of it. “Honestly insane how much i like Original Sin fitting into this little block of ‘good dexter,’” one admitted. While another praised: “Need more Original Sin in my life.” Someone else shared, “Wow!!! Dexter Original Sin finale and season was awesome! Cannot wait for Season 2!...” Amid the handful of renewals at Paramount+, the one canceled show on the platform that has everyone up in arms is Frasier. It was announced earlier this year that Frasier would be getting canceled after two seasons. One user shared, \"Just when I was considering a Paramount+ subscription... oh, well. Thanks for saving me money, Paramount.\" A second person ranted, \"Getting Paramount Plus to watch Frasier was a mistake. I cannot cancel this subscription, and I’ve been trying for 15 minutes.\" With another agreeing, \"The ONLY reason I have Paramount+ is for Frasier, if you cancel it for some woke crucifixion, I will cancel my subscription.\" Another user divulged, \"Love,love,love Frasier reboot. so mad paramount plus cancelled it. I am now unsubscribing to paramount plus. No frasier, no paramount plus.\" Click here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sports and entertainment stories.",
