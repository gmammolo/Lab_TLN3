Released on April 30, 2025, the episode saw the five remaining teams putting their best efforts to outperform each other and be the first to reach the Pit Stop. However, they faced many obstacles on their way. Carson almost jeopardized his team's chances by being unable to make pizzas.\nAd In the latest episode, titled The Pizza de Résistance , the teams had to complete a Roadblock before heading to the Pit Stop to complete the leg. To finish the Roadblock, one member from each team had to make pizzas from scratch. Only after securing the chef's approval could they move on and prepare for arriving at the Pit Stop.\nCarson volunteered to make the pizza but struggled to gain the chef's approval. Despite starting early compared to some of the other teams, Carson and his teammate, Jack, fell behind, putting themselves at risk of elimination.\nAd Trending The Amazing Race fans on X commented on Carson's performance, fearing it would eliminate him and Jack from the competition. While many expressed their nervousness watching Carson fail to make a pizza, others hoped it would not jeopardize their position in the contest.\nExpand Tweet Ad \"if Jack and Carson get taken out by pizza, I’m gonna lose it,\" a fan wrote . \"Jack & Carson…please DO NOT scare us like that again. Get back into the top 3!!\" another fan commented . \"Carson lock in with your pizza making skills! (I think pizza guy hates him at this point)\" a netizen tweeted . Ad Many fans of The Amazing Race worried that Carson's repeated failure to get the chef's approval would result in their elimination. However, Carson managed to complete the Roadblock in the nick of time.\n\"It is not that hard to make that pizza. Now cmon bro,\" a user reacted . \"Carson, no Detroit-style pizza in this challenge,\" a person commented . \"Phew, Carson got it! I was getting a little nervous there,\" another fan wrote . Ad \"NOO CARSON AND JACK STAY WITH ME !!!\" one user posted . Other fans of The Amazing Race expressed a similar sentiment.\n\"The gaymers should’ve just put Jack on the pizza roadblock knowing Carson was bad at it & just hoped Carson could do the next leg’s roadblocks easily. Better the devil you know,\" a person reacted . \"I believe in you Carson you can do it,\" another netizen commented . Ad",
