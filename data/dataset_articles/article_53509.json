  "text": "Sonic Rumble , the free-to-play, Fall Guys- style battle royale that will mark Rovio’s first title involving the Sonic the Hedgehog property, won’t appear worldwide in May 2025, as the global debut is delayed. Sega initially said it would show up on May 8, 2025 on PCs and mobile devices. There’s no release window for it, and Rovio and Sega didn’t share any dates for the 1.2 version either.\nIn the notice on the official site, Sega and Rovio’s statement cited a desire to ensure overall quality of the game. It did mention the 1.2 patch will add Crews for players to join, a Rumble Ranking that lets you earn league rewards for your performance in the game, and the ability to get skills for each character. The companies did note that there will be a Discord Q&A about both this decision and future additions to the game at 6am PT/9am ET on May 2, 2025.\nWhile the Sonic Rumble global debut is delayed, Sega did implement something of a staggered release in some regions worldwide. For example, pre-launch 1 began in August 2024. That made the game available in Colombia, Peru, and the Philippines. After that, people in places like Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden got to play. Pre-launch 2 followed in October 2024, granting access to over 30 additional countries. Among them were Australia, Canada, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.\nThere is no new global release window for the Sonic Rumble PC and mobile worldwide launch yet.",
