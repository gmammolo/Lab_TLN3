  "text": "Holiday nightmares are, sadly, a universal experience. BBC One ’s “Rip Off Britain” returns this Friday for its season finale, taking aim at the travel industry and offering advice to those whose vacations have gone disastrously wrong.\nPresenters Gloria Hunniford, Julia Somerville, and Louise Minchin investigate several cases of holidaymakers whose relaxing getaways were anything but. One couple booked a stay at what was advertised as a luxury resort, only to discover it was more of a building site. The team also investigates the plight of a family stranded in Barbados, abandoned, they claim, by both their airline and travel agent.\nIn another segment, “Rip Off Britain” follows the baffling story of a woman traveling to Turkey, only to end up stuck there without her partner, he was sent home due to a passport oversight. The team also looks at what travellers are entitled to when their holidays are disrupted, offering crucial advice for dealing with these frustrating situations. Tune in to BBC One on Friday, 2 May at 9:30 AM GMT for the season finale of “Rip Off Britain.”",
