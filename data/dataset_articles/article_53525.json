  "text": "1 / 9\nBeyoncé can not only sing, but she also has an amazing figure! In fact, she loves her butt so much that she even sings about it in the song \"Yoncé\". Jay-Z's wife seems to love herself a little too much, but who could blame her with a body like that.\n2 / 9\nAdam Levine has consistently had one hit song after another over the course of the last decade. Anybody who's anybody would like to be in his shoes. Turns out he actually likes all the attention saying that he could never live without it. One thing is clear: he isn't lacking in the confidence department.\n3 / 9\nSometimes, fame and fortune can really get into the heads of celebrities. It's funny to see how much some Hollywood stars are in love with themselves. We've made this little gallery to showcase a select few that we find to be the most narcissistic! Enjoy!\n4 / 9\nIt's no secret that Kanye West thinks very highly of himself: \"I am God's vessel. But my greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live\" is just one of the quotes that shows us how humble Kanye really is.\n5 / 9\nGwyneth Paltrow is probably one of the most popular and well-paid actresses in Hollywood. She has said on several occasions that she could never give up her glamorous lifestyle for a the life of a \"Normie\". \"I am who I am. I could never be somebody who only makes 25,000 dollars a year.\" Not everybody is as talented as you, Gwyneth!\n6 / 9\nJames Franco does post the occasional frisky selfie on Instagram once and while. Franco has totally convinced himself that he has one of the hottest bodies on Instagram. To all of the people who don't want to see these types of pictures, he has the following to say: \"I didn't ask you to look at my content. The pictures are there because people want to see them. Don't follow me if you don't want to look at them.\" Looks like we have a narcissistic Franco on our hands!\n7 / 9\nJustin Bieber is really one of the most talented artists of our generation, but we think he already knows that. \"Never say I'm not talented. If you haven't figured it out by now, I was found not made.\" Looks like our young star has bitten a little more off than he can chew. Our next star would never work for less than a few million.\n8 / 9\nMiley Cyrus would never even remotely think about comparing herself with other normal teenage girls. \"I'm on a whole other level than most girls my age who don't get what they want because they don't know how to.\" Sounds like she has everybody wrapped around her finger...\n9 / 9\nSpencer Pratt became famous with the reality TV show The Hills back in the day. He was able to star alongside Lauren Conrad who, in return, pushed his popularity to the limit! Pratt is actually pretty sure that he was the person who made Lauren Conrad famous. \"I think that I helped Lauren gain millions of fans and millions of dollars as well,\" says the young actor. Our next star is completely obsessed with her rear end...",
