  "text": "Former NBA star Lamar Odom has taken a big step toward getting his life back on track after a recent run-in with the law.\nThe 46-year-old basketball legend was arrested in Las Vegas on January 17 for driving under the influence and multiple traffic violations, including speeding more than 41 miles per hour over the limit.\nWhile Lamar denied being under the influence at the time, he’s now committed to kicking his marijuana habit, entering a 30-day treatment program at iRely Recovery in Los Angeles.\nHis manager, Gina Rodriguez, told the Daily Mail: “After a recent incident, he took a step back to reflect and address triggers he's been dealing with.\nHe’s taking full responsibility and choosing to be proactive about his wellbeing.”\nFor those unfamiliar, this isn’t his first public battle with addiction.\nHe’s been open about his struggles with drugs and alcohol, including a near-fatal overdose in 2015 that left him with 12 seizures, six strokes, collapsed lungs, and ruptured kidneys.\nIn his 2019 memoir Darkness to Light, he described how that ordeal forced him to rethink his life.\nLamar’s personal struggles also touched his former marriage to Khloé Kardashian, who revealed last year how she had to file for divorce after realizing she couldn’t save him from addiction.\nThe 41-year-old reality TV star said, “You can't want it more than I do,” a statement that marked a pivotal moment in both their lives.\nNow, he is focused on healing and moving forward, with friends and fans cheering him on as he works toward a healthier future.\nRELATED: Kendall Jenner reacts to Khloe Kardashian’s shocking decision",
