  "text": "Next Article\nWhy you must skip these sugary breakfast foods\nWhat's the story\nBreakfast is often touted to be the most important meal of the day, but not all breakfast foods are equal.\nEating sugary options in the morning can cause energy crashes and lower concentration levels during the day.\nKnowing which sugary breakfast foods to avoid can help you stay more focused and productive.\nHere are some common sugary breakfast items best left off your morning menu, if you want to boost your concentration.\nCereals\nSugary cereals: A sweet trap\nMany cereals that are marketed for both children and adults are loaded with sugar.\nWhile these cereals may provide a quick energy boost, they often lead to a mid-morning slump (thanks to their high sugar content).\nGoing for whole grain or low-sugar alternatives can help sustain energy levels and improve concentration through the day.\nPastries\nPastries: Tempting yet troublesome\nPastries like donuts, croissants, and muffins make for a popular breakfast choice but are usually loaded with sugar and refined carbohydrates.\nThese ingredients can lead to spikes in blood sugar levels and drops, resulting in decreased alertness and focus.\nOpting for whole-grain options or fresh fruit in their place can provide more stable energy.\nYogurts\nFlavored yogurts: Hidden sugars\nFlavored yogurts often have added sugars that most people ignore while looking at healthy breakfast options.\nWhile yogurt is healthy, those with added flavors can have as much sugar as a candy bar.\nChoosing plain yogurt topped with fresh fruits offers a healthier option without compromising on the taste.\nPancakes\nPancakes with syrup: A sugar overload\nPancakes drenched in syrup may seem delicious but come packed with sugars that add little to no nutritional value while also causing energy crashes later on.\nThe combination of refined flour in pancakes and sugary syrup results in fluctuating blood glucose levels, which in turn negatively impacts concentration.\nGranola bars\nGranola bars: Not always healthy\nGranola bars are commonly seen as healthy snacks, but many of them have added sugars in the form of different names (like corn syrup or honey).\nThese bars can fill you up momentarily, but they cannot keep you focused longer due to the high glycemic index content as opposed to the less processed ones (like nuts or seeds) blended into homemade ones without added sweeteners during preparation stages themselves.",
