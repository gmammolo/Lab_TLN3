  "text": "Madly Making Music\n.\n,\n11:11 pm\nBah! I went to see my primary doc and my sleep apnea doc recently, and also did some shopping, and I seem to have caught something. My throat is a bit sore and I'm minorly headachy, even though I'm still on the antibiotic, which just isn't right. I didn't have a sore throat before I got on the antibiotics, so I think this is a new thing. I did take a Covid test, and that's negative, at least. Hopefully it's one of the super-short and mild viruses, and I'll feel better tomorrow.\nI am still furious about what that man and his cronies are doing in our government, and still calling my senators and representative, though not as often as I feel I should. But I have only so much energy, and thinking about that stuff long enough to make a few good phone calls is emotionally exhausting. I wish I was healthier; I think if I was protesting would make me energized instead of tired. But I don't get that option right now, and I'm determined to get some stuff published when I know a lot of my friends will be looking to see what's new. So this Bandcamp Friday is my immediate deadline, since the next one isn't until August.\nTo that end, I have been working on recording Magick in My Heart anyway, with the help of Celestial Seasonings' Throat Soother's Tea (herbal more than medicinal, mostly vitamin C, licorice, slippery elm, and ginger). So far I have three tracks I'm pretty happy with--Magick Comes From Within, An Imbolc Tale, and Together Magic; and I'm starting on Honoring the Circle. I'm also thinking of some other songs, like Heckate's Ride, Sacred Cliff, Mushroom Magic, and maybe even redoing Coyote Afoot. There are other possibilities too, but I'm running short on time between now and Friday. I'd love to get seven songs done, but three when I've been sick isn't bad at all, and I'm not done yet.\nI may be up all night on Thursday again making cover art. At least I have no zoom filks on the calendar for the weekend, so if I'm useless over the weekend, it won't be a disaster. I just can't let myself become useless until the new album is posted, however many songs it ends up having!\nAt least these are some of my own and My Angel's favorite songs. It feels good to be recording them!\nI am still furious about what that man and his cronies are doing in our government, and still calling my senators and representative, though not as often as I feel I should.
