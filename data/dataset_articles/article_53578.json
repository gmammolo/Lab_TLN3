  "text": "They say everybody should go to the Kentucky Derby at least once in their lives.\nI did.\nThey say everybody should go to the Kentucky Derby at least once in their lives.\nI did.\nAnd that was more than enough for me.\nIt was one of the most miserable days horses and race fans have ever had to endure at Churchill Downs.\nIt was May 6, 1989.\nThe weatherman called for rain in the morning with clearing skies and temperatures in the upper 50s to low 60s by post time.\nThat fellow would have been lynched if the crowd had found him at post time.\nMy wife told me to wear a heavier jacket.\nBut no, I believed the weatherman.\nI just stuck a light rain jacket in the car — just in case.\nThe Kentucky Lottery was new that year, and the winner of the $1 million grand prize would be determined by the winner of the Derby.\nI was there to cover the winner of the lottery, not the Derby.\nIn case you’re wondering, Sunday Silence won the race.\nAnd Danny Hurley of Chavies won the million.\nBut that’s beside the point.\nThe real story was the weather.\nIt was 43 degrees at post time.\nFORTY THREE DEGREES.\nThat’s 51 degrees colder than the record high — 94 degrees in 1959.\nThe crowd had already endured a day of wind, rain, hail and sleet.\nAnd some even claimed to have seen a few snow flakes.\nBut it could have been just thick sleet.\nPeople who had brought blankets to sit on in the infield wound up wearing them.\nCoats covered spring frocks that women had spent considerable time and money on.\nWide-brimmed hats were worn with ear muffs as an accessory.\nAnd hot chocolate was more in demand than mint juleps.\nOf course, you could find the occasional attention-seeker all decked out in a bikini, claiming that she wasn’t the least bit cold.\nBut unless she was wearing blue lipstick, she was lying through her teeth.\nIt was a miserable day.\nBoth the track and the infield were listed as muddy.\nAnd they were.\nAnd unless you had a seat in the grandstands or along the rail somewhere, you could spend the whole day without seeing a horse.\nHundreds of people were huddled around TV sets near the betting windows, watching the race.\nI can watch TV at home.\nWhen I finally got back in the car — and got the heater cranked up — I decided that somebody up there didn’t want me at the Derby.\nI was familiar with Jonah and the whale.\nSo, I’ve been doing the crowd a favor every year and staying home.\nAnd you know what?\nThere hasn’t been a Derby day quite like that since.\nKeith Lawrence; klawrence@messenger-inquirer.com\n{{description}}\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\nKeep it Clean.
