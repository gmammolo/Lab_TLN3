  "text": "Shaquille O’Neal was shocked when Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, and Randy Savage came to his house.\nSpeaking on a recent edition of The Big Podcast with Shaq, NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal revealed the moment he found out the drama in professional wrestling was nothing more than a storyline.\n“So, I did a WWE event at my house in Orlando, and said, ‘Hey, all the wrestlers come by. So, Hulk Hogan came in, a couple of other guys came in, Ric Flair and Hulk Hogan… and Macho Man. And all these [guys] start eating my hors d’oeuvres and talking with each other. Growing up, I always thought they hated each other.”\nContinuing, Shaq admitted that it was a difficult day for him as it ruined the illusion that professional wrestling was real.\n“You know what’s crazy? It actually was a sad day for me,” Shaq admitted. “Because I thought — even though I’m a professional, make a whole bunch of money — I thought that wrestling was real.”\nHow Many Times Has Shaquille O’Neal Wrestled In WWE Or AEW?\nThough he would go on to made a number of appearances in the world of professional wrestling over the years, Shaquille O’Neal has only competed inside the squared circle on two occasions. His first match took place on the Grandest Stage of Them All at WrestleMania 32 in Arlington, TX when he took part in the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal that was ultimately won by Baron Corbin.\nOn the March 3, 2021 episode of AEW Dynamite, Shaquille O’Neal teamed with Jade Cargill in her in-ring debut. The duo successfully defeated the team of Cody Rhodes and Red Velvet, but Shaq didn’t escape unscathed.\nAfter taking a hellacious bump through two tables while a horrified Jade Cargill looked on, the basketball star was loaded into an ambulance. However, O’Neal mysteriously disappeared from the ambulance, and he hasn’t been seen in All Elite Wrestling since that date. Tony Khan addressed this unresolved storyline in a 2024 interview.\nh/t WrestlingInc",
