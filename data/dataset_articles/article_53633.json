  "text": "‘He ruined it’: Indian barber asks UK vlogger for ₹1,800 for haircut, divides internet\nGeorge Buckley, a UK-based travel vlogger, says he was overcharged at a barber shop in India, igniting a heated debate.\nBritish travel vlogger and content creator George Buckley recently shared an Instagram reel detailing how he was overcharged at a barber shop during his trip to India, an incident that has sparked widespread discussion online.\nIn his video, Buckley claims he was initially quoted ₹1,800 for a basic haircut and head massage. As he hesitated, the price quickly dropped to ₹1,500, then ₹1,200. Sensing something was off, Buckley turned to other customers in the shop and asked, “How much do you guys pay?” but received no response. When he pressed further, the barber admitted that the usual charge for the service is ₹700- ₹800.\nAlso read: Man says he has post-partum depression after quitting ₹2.3 lakh job to take care of baby\nDespite the back-and-forth, Buckley ended up paying ₹1,200. He left the shop without tipping and later took to Instagram to share his experience. In the caption, he wrote, “I was going to tip but he ruined it 🇮🇳.”\nHe added, “After a fair bit of experience travelling Asia, you can tell when you’re getting overcharged and this was definitely one of those moments! I was planning on giving him a tip but honesty comes first. Hopefully he doesn’t try the same trick on another traveller. A slightly sour end to the haircut, but an interesting experience nonetheless!”\nTake a look at the video:\nThe post quickly gained traction, drawing mixed reactions in the comments section.\nOne user defended the barber, writing, “Devil’s advocate here — why not pay the man who can barely afford to live his ₹1,800? It’s like £15-20, which is what you’d pay in the UK. Why haggle him down over £5? It makes zero difference to you and a huge difference to his life. I’d have tipped him an extra ₹1,800 instead of haggling over pennies.”\nAnother viewer disagreed, saying, “Yes, you were overcharged for a basic head massage and a haircut. It should probably be somewhere around ₹300-400.”\nAlso read: Bengaluru founder accused of lying about ₹4.2 lakh salary says it’s ‘common in tech’\nAnother wrote, “Hey! They probably overcharged because you’re a foreigner, which unfortunately happens in some local spots. But that’s not how most of India is. Please don’t judge the whole country by one experience. Next time, try visiting good, high-end shops where prices are fair and service is reliable. India has a lot of honest and welcoming people—I hope you get to see the real side of it.”\nTrending NewsViral News, Video, Photos and\nWeather Updatesof India and around the world\nTrending NewsViral News, Video, Photos and\nWeather Updatesof India and around the world",
