  "text": "Monday\nI am having an issue with my speaker I ask it to play a specific radio station and it won’t play it started about a week ago\nthe specific radio station I want it to play is “105.1 knci” which is a local country radio station and it jut won’t work I have already tried re setting the devices and still not working it also did this wit other radio stations. is their a way to fix this because I mainly use it to listen to to the radio I hate to have to look in to getting some other devices\n, it starts to load, fails, and shows a generic audacy icon.\nany one have some sort of of solution to this\nMonday\nI have the same issue. Very frustrating\nMonday\nI have the same problem with 3aw and 6pr radio. But plays other stations. Since Friday this has been the problem\nMonday\nRadioapp doesn't play any station. Started about 4 days ago. Works on my other google devices just not my nest hub.\nyesterday\nI have the same problem and it is very annoying. It was even mentioned on 2GB this morning. I have contacted Google as 2GB stated they will follow up and as well, I also emailed the RadioApp people direct ( it's Australian ), to no avail. as of this stage. Resetting the Google Nest device of storage & cache does not clear the problem.\nI would point out I have no trouble streaming Radio with Amazon Alexa devices at this point.\nyesterday\nI resetted all my google nests and none work on 3aw 2gb 6pr.seems to be the only stations that don’t work on mine. I listen to sen Melbourne and Perth sen and no problems.\nthanks for your info and I hope they can fix it.\n12m ago\n11m ago\n3 hours ago\nHello to all on this thread.\nThis turns out to be most likely a worldwide Google firmware issue.\nLots of info and discussion on workarounds and fixes that appear to being rolled out in the UK.\nhttps://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Speakers-and-Displays/RadioApp-no-loading-on-Google-Nest-Hub-...",
