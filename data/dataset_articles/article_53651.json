  "text": "log in or registerto comment.\nWell… define starter home. I got a starter for about half that in LA but I have a shared wall townhome. Not great, but if we’re talking no shared walls and a yard, ya I can see that costing more… Except I also saw those for about this price, only with like… 600sq ft? Pick you battles, but those aren’t a million even in the city.\nNow, maybe the 200 cities are specific neighborhoods, like how Santa Monica isn’t technically Los Angeles since it’s got it’s own city government. Same with Beverly Hills, Bel Air, etc. You sure as hell ain’t getting a place for 1 mil there, even if it’s a small “starter home.”\nAll of your question are answered right at the beginning of the article:\n“Zillow defines “cities” as distinct housing markets, which can include large suburbs, towns or boroughs within major metro areas. “Starter homes” are defined as properties in the bottom third of home values within a given market. That means these aren’t luxury listings — they’re the least expensive homes available in each city.”\nZillow is a part of the problem. With all the data collected and only a few companies, prices are conveniently increasing at extreme rates. It is not just cities; land and rural areas are increasing at high rates.\nThe real issue is the commodification of housing. Houses shouldn’t make people money; they are supposed to be homes to live in.\nThis! We have the means to provide housing for everyone but don’t because, fuck you thats why.\nSpeaking of which, zillow’s stupid “zestimate” is worthless. Any assclown can put their house up for way too high a price and the zestimate will automatically jump up to match.\nApparently the value is whatever the seller says it is, even if the home has been on the market for over a year (either continuously or repeatedly taken off and put on, I guess to reset the time on market).\nGet off your ass and get 50+ full time jobs you lazy fucks!\nIf I keep paying the current $1200 a month to my landlord it’ll eventually trickle down to me. No doubt!\nThen with that revenue, I’ll buy my first house!\nIn reality, I’m almost 28 and I have no delusions about home ownership. Just like retirement!\nOnly 1200 a month?\nGod I wish.\nThat’s the going rate for renting a room in someone’s house in my neck of the woods.\nAnd stop earning avocados.\nStop eating avocados. Start eating landlords.\nTough to stomach at first, but very good for you and the community.\nGuess it’s a nonstarter.\nA starter home?! This home is a finisher home! A shelterer of gods! The GOLDEN GOD!\nI am untethered, and my rage knows no bounds!\nYou rang?\n* curb your enthusiasm theme plays *\nThis…is hard to believe. I’ve been looking around non-major US cities, and even some major cities, and the starter homes are around 200-500k.\nThat’s still fucked for a starter home but a million??? That’s the average home price in Honolulu and NYC lol.\ni was going to say its avg in the west coast blue area. 200-500k is “cheap”\nIt literally sounds super fake.\nI can’t find a single major city without 200k to 350k homes lol\nIt takes like 30 seconds to check what starter homes cost in any city, yet people will believe this shit instead of just go look.\nEdit: this is the “source”\nhttps://www.zillow.com/research/million-dollar-start-home-2025-35100/Just 1 chart with literally zero further info, no published actual data of where these numbers came from, how they calculated them, how they gathered the data.\nWhy do people fall for empty garbage articles like this so easy. I wish we collectively called this out more.\nIf a person posts an article citing another article, instead of just the original article, they should get fuckin blasted for it and downvoted to hell.\nPost. Original. Sources.\nI quite kiterally cant find anything in my city for less than 900k, and they are rare\nWhat city\nDoesn’t sound super fake if you are looking for a place with what I think are pretty reasonable basic characteristics of comfort and security.\nHouse that can accommodate a small family not in a higher than average crime area, does not require fix up maintenance that those of us working long hours will never have time to do or can’t afford to have done, has been well cared for and doesn’t feel gross. I’m not talking luxury homes here, I’m just talking about something that you would at least look forward to coming home to.\nWhen I see all these people buying these homes, I’m just shocked at how they have either accrued so much wealth or are so comfortable with so much debt.\nIt’s pretty tough out there right now.\n“When I eliminate all the homes that normal people would classify as a starter home, I can’t find any starter homes!”\n“Wait to buy a starter homes you are telling me I can’t live in a rich gentrified white neighborhood, I might have a black guy for a neighbour? That just won’t do!”\n“Sorry anything not within 5 blocks of a Starbucks can’t possibly count as a starter home”\nThis is what people sound like when they talk about “safety” and “crime rates” and “starter homes” in the same sentence.\nTry looking in San Francisco, or any city in the entire Bay Area. You won’t find a 500sq ft shack for less than $800k.\n3 seconds of looking and I found five houses under 500k. Two of them genuinely look pretty decent too tbh, not even rough looking homes.\nAs someone who has lived in and priced out homes in major US cities, I find this article to be accurate.\n(X) Doubt\nUpdated 1400 sf 3 bed 1 bath $1M where I live.\nAnd you wonder why the young folk vote for conservatives…\n1 they don’t 2 why would thismake them?\nJust don’t live in a city geez\nEdit: Yes, my quest for downvotes is successful.\nI aim to be karma neutral on the fediverse and had a pretty good day I need to counteract.\nA couple years ago this was the “just don’t live in California” argument.\njust don’t live\n^This guy gets it\nPeople take this advice, move to a lower COL area and rise the COL.\nPeople that handed the advice now complains that they can’t afford to live in their not-so-low-COL-anymore area\nThat’s where the jobs are.\nNot much for good paying work in podunk towns.\nJust commute for an hour to work every day. Ew, no, we don’t want to fund buses, that’s for poors. Pay for it yourself.\nEw, commuting. Just WFH\nYou want a WFH plumber? Cause I don’t.\nI know you’re trolling, but you could at least write some funny ones\nIt’s a dry humor\nDesiccated, even\nYou get me.\ndeleted by creator\nAt which point, Id have to spend the money saved on housing on buying, fueling, maintaining and insuring a car, if I was even able to drive one in the first place.\nJust work from home, jeez\nSure thing, just need to find a jedi to teach me the force so that I can move and assemble the parts in the factory without actually being there.\nGotta work from home, but keep your mailing address somewhere expensive like Seattle. The pay is higher if you ‘live’ somewhere expensive for some reason. I guess you work better if you live somewhere expensive.",
