  "text": "May 01, 2025\nTimes Now Digital, TN Lifestyle DeskNever joke about her weight, skin, height, or hair. Even small comments can hurt her confidence deeply. A lot of women grow up insecure about how they look which gets planted from an early change.\nCredit: Canva\nSaying things like “you’re too sensitive” can make her feel ashamed of how she feels. Let her know it’s okay to express her emotions. Not just girls but boys also go through this.\nCredit: Canva\nIf she enjoys reading, dancing, or playing games, don’t laugh at her hobbies. Encouraging her passions helps her grow. Who knows she could be the next famous dancer or singer if you keep encouraging her.\nCredit: Canva\nMaking fun of her friends may embarrass her or cause distance. Respect her choices and friendships. Friends are a big source of support, just like parents.\nCredit: Canva\nNever say her goals are silly or impossible. Even if they change later, dreams are important for building self-belief. Take Elle Woods from ‘Legally Blonde’ who was told by her family that she wasn’t meant for legal studies. In the end, she proved them all wrong.\nCredit: Canva\nAvoid teasing her about what she wears. Clothes are a way she explores identity, so support her instead.\nCredit: Canva\nDon’t tease her for slipping up. Everyone makes mistakes. It’s part of learning and growing.\nCredit: Canva\nPuberty can be confusing and sensitive. Joking about changes can cause shame and silence. Comments regarding her braces or pimples will hurt her self esteem.\nCredit: Canva\nWhether she’s loud, quiet, or has a unique way of speaking, she deserves to feel heard without mockery.\nCredit: Canva\nTeasing by saying “Why can't you be like her?” hurts. Every child is different so celebrate her for who she is.\nCredit: Canva\nThanks For Reading!",
