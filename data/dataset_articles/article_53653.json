  "text": "Mary Kenny: The Brenda Fricker I knew was a seemingly happy schoolgirl, but sadly, that was not her reality\nIt’s possible, maybe probable, that the harrowing events of her life helped the Oscar winner become such a great actress\nI was at school with Brenda Fricker – we were in the same class at Loreto, St Stephen’s Green – and I remember her as a sweet-natured young girl with a halo of golden curls.\nShe was, in my recollection, favoured by the nuns as she always won prizes at feiseanna, and shone at drama and elocution.\nJoin the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel\nStay up to date with all the latest news",
