  "text": "Dear Annie: I’ve worked as a dental assistant at the same small practice for eight years. I love my patients, and I get along with the dentists, but the office manager, “Diane,” is making my job unbearable.\nShe micromanages everything I do -- double-checking my appointment notes, questioning why I take five-minute breaks and rearranging supplies I’ve already organized. She wasn’t always like this, but ever since she took a course in “leadership development,” she’s been acting like she owns the place.\nI’ve tried talking to her calmly about needing more space to do my job, but she just nods and then nothing changes. The dentists are great, but they stay out of office politics. I don’t want to leave a job I’ve loved for so long, but I’m starting to dread going in.\nIs it worth speaking up again -- or should I start looking for a new position? -- Sick of Being Micromanaged\nDear Sick of Being Micromanaged: Diane didn’t learn leadership; she learned how to be a nuisance with a clipboard.\nYou tried the polite route, and she ignored it. Your best bet now is to go above her and bring your concerns to the dentists. They may not love office drama, but they do care about keeping good staff -- and if you’re halfway out the door, they deserve to know why.\nView prior ‘Dear Annie’ columns\nFollow Annie Lane on Instagram at @dearannieofficial.
