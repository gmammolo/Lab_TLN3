  "text": "BROOKLYN Beckham has dealt his family another snub after failing to wish a family member a Happy Birthday. The 26-year-old is no longer on speaking terms with his family after an epic fallout with his parents and his brothers. Now, it appears that the rift has gotten deeper after he failed to mark his cousin's birthday like the rest of his family. He failed to mark Finlay James' birthday online but mum Victoria and his brothers, Romeo and Cruz, were all quick to mark the occasion. Brooklyn's mum Victoria was the first of the clan to mark her nephew's birthday as she shared a throwback of Finlay as an eight-year-old. Alongside the image, the fashion mogul said: \"Happy birthday. We love you!!!\" 23-year-old Romeo also continued the trend by sharing a classic photo of Finlay as he added the simple caption: \"Happy Birthday broskie.\" Furthermore, Cruz shared his own tribute with a snap of him and Finlay in matching suits as he wrote: \"Happy Birthday.\" Brooklyn failed to interact with any posts nor mention Finlay's birthday as the family feud continues to rumble on. Finlay is connecting the family as the son of Louise, Victoria's sister. The lad has famously enjoyed a close bond with the entire Beckham clan making Brooklyn's latest snub even more telling. It is the latest birthday snub dealt by Brooklyn in recent weeks after he also failed to acknowledge Romeo's big day or join in the celebrations. All of the Beckham family were seen posting sweet messages to Romeo on his big day. However, his big brother Brooklyn chose to snub his sibling, as their family feud rages on . The birthday snub follows months of social media swipes after Brooklyn failed to turn up for his dad's 50th birthday party. Brooklyn and his wife Nicola , 30, remain estranged from the famous family, with unfollows and Instagram blocks fuelling rumours of an all-out war. Things escalated when Brooklyn and Nicola renewed their vows last month, despite only getting married three years previous. Brooklyn did not invite any of his family. In the photos shared by the couple on Instagram, they are surrounded by Nicola’s family and friends . The ceremony was even officiated by Nicola's father, Nelson Peltz , 83. A source told The Sun of David and Victoria's reaction to the vow renewal after they found out about the ceremony on a US site. They told us: “This was the final kick in the teeth for David and Victoria. “Seeing Nelson [Nicola's father] having such a pivotal role at the ceremony was heartbreaking for David especially.” ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF. \"The Sun\", \"Sun\", \"Sun Online\" are registered trademarks or trade names of News Group Newspapers Limited.
