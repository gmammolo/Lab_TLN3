  "text": "SAMANTHA Cameron’s luxury fashion brand Cefinn is set to shut its doors after eight years. The wife of former PM Lord Cameron said the decision was “very hard”, but admitted industry pressures had made it impossible for the label to stay afloat. Cefinn’s next winter collection, launching later this month, will be its final offering. The brand will continue to trade through its London stores and its website in the coming months, allowing customers to snap up the remaining pieces. Lady Cameron , who worked in fashion before her move to No10, has had her label celebrated for its stylish yet practical designs for modern women. It has been worn by both Princess Kate and Queen Camilla . But retail firms have been hit hard by the Labour Government’s hikes to the minimum wage and employers’ National Insurance contributions in April, as well as the impact of rising business rates. It comes as plus-size fashion brand Live Unlimited has filed a note of intent to appoint administrators this week. Public filings reveal that the firm has enlisted advisers from Irwin Mitchell to manage the process. A note of intent typically gives a retailer ten days before it officially goes bust, although this can be cut shorter if needed. The label was launched in 2012 and has been stocked online and in-store by both Next and John Lewis . FASHION chain Primark saw sales grow over the last six months thanks to better weather and store openings, its parent firm Associated British Foods reported. UK and Ireland sales grew by 1 per cent in the second half, with the new shops having offset a 2 per cent fall in like-for-like sales. Boss George Weston said Primark was not raising prices but ABF’s grocery division is being forced to pass on cost increases. WETHERSPOONS is adding Irish takeaway dish The Spice Bag to its menus in England , Scotland and Wales later this month. From September 17, punters can enjoy the salt and chilli chicken strips dish, including red onion, chillies and coriander, for £8.99 with a soft drink — or £10.52 with a pint. Sarah Shaw of the pub chain said: “It has already proven extremely popular with customers in our Republic of Ireland pubs .” BRITAIN’S favourite festive treats are shrinking in size but soaring in price this year, trade magazine The Grocer says. Quality Street tubs are now 550g, down from 600g, with prices up 16.7 per cent to £7, although Asda offers them for £4.68. Terry’s Chocolate Orange has shrunk by 7.6 per cent, although its price has jumped 33.3 per cent to £2 at Tesco and 28.2 per cent to £2.50 at Sainsbury’s. Cadbury Roses tins have also downsized, dropping from 750g to 700g. Prices climbed by as much as 17.9 per cent, with tins in Morrisons £16.50, up from £14.",
