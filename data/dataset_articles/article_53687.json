  "text": "BUTTING in, always being late and taking things personally - we all have annoying habits, and they are part and parcel of being human. They can even partly define our personalities. But they can also be something we are embarrassed of, irritate us in our partners or even signal an underlying health issue - yep, really! If you are already aware of your bad habits, well done. For they are harder to spot in yourself, and much easier to identify in other people, especially those closest to you. We’re not talking the small things, like slurping food, biting nails or twiddling your hair , but go-to behaviours you wish you or your loved ones had left in childhood. But how do we get these bad habits and traits in the first place? Are we born with them, or do we develop them? Do we pick them up from other people, such as our parents or close friends? Gemma Perlin , leading life coach and hypnotherapist, tells Sun Health: “My belief, based on helping people change their behaviour, is that while we may have certain predispositions, most of our habits and traits are developed through our experiences and interactions with the world.” We end up following patterns in behaviour that we don’t even think about - until someone points them out because they are so sick of them. With Gemma’s help, we take a look at practical ways to overcome common bad habits. But don’t expect instant results, it’s not an overnight job and could take months of work to change something so entrenched. IF you keep butting in, not allowing anyone to utter a full sentence, people may find you very tedious - and have likely told you to ‘stop interrupting’. And if you're the victim of a partner's interruption you might feel disrespected. Gemma says while it can be a sign of excitement or a desire to be included in conversation, continuous interrupting could also be a sign of needing control. “Interrupting can often develop when you haven’t had the space or permission to speak so there is a sense of urgency to get your point across,” adds Gemma. For example, if there were always louder voices in your home, and you needed to get yours across in order to feel in control of your situation. Interrupting could also be a sign of underlying conditions, namely attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is a key symptom of impulsivity - one of the main symptoms of ADHD. ADHD has long been associated with naughty schoolkids who cannot sit still in class. And that is part of it. Fidgeting, daydreaming and getting easily distracted are all symptoms of the behavioural condition, which is why it is often spotted in children. However, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is far more complex than simply having trouble focusing. Henry Shelford, CEO and co-founder of ADHD UK, says: “If it isn’t debilitating, it isn’t ADHD.” In recent years, social media has given rise to trends which conflate specific personality traits or single behaviours with ADHD. You might be thinking, ‘I’m always losing my keys, forgetting birthdays and I can never concentrate at work — I must have ADHD’. But it’s not as simple as that. Though these may all point to the condition, Dr Elena Touroni, a consultant psychologist and co-founder of The Chelsea Psychology Clinic, says: “The key distinction lies in how much a behaviour impacts a person’s daily life. “Genuine ADHD symptoms affect multiple areas of life - work, relationships and emotional wellbeing - whereas personality traits are typically context-dependent and less disruptive.” ADHD UK’s Henry, who has the condition himself, adds: “Having ADHD is hard. One in ten men with ADHD and one in four women with ADHD will at some point try to take their own lives.” So how can ADHD manifest in someone’s life? While hyperactivity is a common indicator, here are nine other subtle signs: FIX IT: Instead of interrupting, Gemma suggests engaging in an internal dialogue. “Ask yourself, ‘is this the right time to say this?’ or, ‘will my contribution add value to the conversation?’,” she says. “Deep breathing is another valuable tool. Take a few deep breaths to calm your mind and body. This can help you stay present and focused on the conversation.” WE’VE all been there… in an instance, taking what a pal says like a dagger straight to the heart. And while every once in a while is understandable, are you guilty of always taking things a bit too personally, or do you notice your partner jumping to that conclusion? Even if something is framed as a joke or constructive criticism? “This can stem from low self-esteem or a fear of rejection,” says Gemma. “Remember that others' actions often have more to do with their own issues than with you.” FIX IT: Try to try to see things from their view, Gemma says. “Instead of assuming negative intent, try to see situations from the other person's perspective,” she adds. “Consider their own experiences, emotions, and motivations.” Everyone likes someone who can ‘laugh at themselves’. So instead of feeling attacked when someone makes a joke about you, can you see the funny side or feel flattered that they noticed something about you? THERE’S always at least one friend in the group that you can count on to always be late . And if it's your partner, it can really start to get annoying. But are you that friend? There is an argument that those that are always late are more optimistic, believing they can fit everything into their days. But aside from the fact it can mean you fall behind and miss important meetings or events, it’s a trait that can really irritate loved ones. It may be perceived as being selfish, unreliable, or people may just ‘go ahead’ without your arrival as they’ve waited too long before. FIX IT: Gemma suggests visualising yourself arriving on time for appointments. “This can help you create a positive mental image of your desired behaviour,” she says. Use tools to complete tasks efficiently - like planners or time-block on Google or iPhone calendars - to make sure the day doesn’t run away with you. If you’re someone who crams a lot in a day, then it’s probably no surprise that your timing is off. “Be mindful of the expectations you have of yourself, how realistic is your ability to get things done in the time you have assigned,” asks Gemma. DO you find it uncomfortable when your partner tries to steal the limelight? Are you someone who craves the attention of others? You may consider it part of you ‘outgoing personality’, but it might reveal something deeper. “This might be a coping mechanism for feelings of insecurity,” Gemma reveals. And unfortunately, a lot of others will see it that way, too. It could also be a sign of loneliness, or some personality disorders like histrionic personality disorder. FIX IT : “Instead, encourage empathy and a genuine interest in others,” Gemma suggests. “Practise active listening and find ways to contribute without dominating the conversation.” It can be hard when you’re so used to wanting to be the centre of attention, but Gemma suggests emulating someone else who you know is a good listener to see how they do it. DO people often ask you, ‘Are you even listening?’ Or is your partner the one seemingly not listening? Do you find yourself scrambling to remember what you were told in a conversation that passed like a blur? “Not listening properly could be due to distractions or a lack of focus,” says Gemma. FIX IT: Gemma suggests active listening techniques. “Stay present and keep your focus on the conversation,” she suggests. “Avoid thinking about your response while the other person is speaking; instead, fully absorb what they are saying. “To establish a connection with the person speaking, try mirroring their body language, tone of voice, and pace and maintain eye contact. “Ask open-ended questions too for more in-depth sharing and after the speaker has finished, summarise what you've heard and ask for confirmation.” WORRYING, which tends to be negative thoughts about a future event, and feeling anxious about every little thing, especially when it’s out of your control, can leave you stressed, disrupt your sleep and make you feel emotional. “This can be a draining habit to break,” says Gemma. For those around you, it may be more of a concern than it is annoying. But it can leave others feeling perplexed, if your worries are unwarranted. It can be a sign of underlying mental health issues, mostly anxiety. Generalised anxiety disorder, for example, may be diagnosed if you ‘often worry about a wide range of things’, the NHS says. FIX IT: “Simplicity is key here,” says Gemma. When you’re feeling worried, practice mindfulness and focus on the present moment. “Focus on your breath and what you can see, hear and feel right now,\" says Gemma. \"For example, if you were sitting on a chair, notice the colour of the chair, the sensation of the chair on your body and any sounds in the room. “Try writing down your thoughts too, as getting them out of your head onto paper can sometimes make them feel less of an issue. “Remember you are not your thoughts and they are not facts.” Speak to a GP if feelings of worry and anxiety are affecting your daily life. Anxiety is what we feel when we are worried, tense or afraid. It is a natural human response when we feel under threat, and most people experience it at times. Anxiety becomes a mental health problem if it impacts your ability to live your life as fully as you want to. For example: There are dozens of symptoms of anxiety that can affect the body and the mind. This can be everything from a churning feeling in your stomach to sleeping problems to feeling like the world is speeding up or slowing down. Around one in 10 people in the UK have anxiety at any one time. There are various treatments available, including self-help resources, talking therapies, and medication. If you struggling with anxiety, speak to your GP or call Mind's infoline on 0300 123 3393. Source: Mind WE all know that person who is hot-headed, reacting with rage to small things or jumping to conclusions. If this is you, people may walk on eggshells around you or simply find you irritating to be around. Gemma says hot-headedness can be a sign of high emotional reactivity and things not feeling OK under the surface. FIX IT: To try and overcome this, she suggests relaxation techniques when you feel yourself heading towards a typical reaction. “Identify triggers and develop healthy coping mechanisms,” she says. According to Gemma, coping mechanisms can include deep, slow breaths, inhaling for four counts, holding for four, and exhaling for six. “I suggest taking a short break when you feel your temper rising,” she adds. “Stepping away and changing the environment, even briefly, can provide clarity and reduce your emotions from escalating. \"Use visualisation techniques too; imagining a calm, safe place can help centre yourself during stressful situations.” IF you notice these habits in a friend or loved one, and feel like you should say something, it’s important to address it properly, with empathy and understanding. “Avoid blaming or shaming them as that won’t go well. Instead, focus on expressing how their behaviour affects you and offer support,” says Gemma. Find a quiet, private setting where you can talk openly without interruptions and use ‘I’ statements, as these sound less accusatory. “For example, instead of saying, ‘you're always late,’ say, ‘I feel frustrated when I have to wait for you’,” suggests Gemma. “Highlight the benefits of changing the habit and how it can improve their life. “For example, you could say, ‘If you were more punctual, we could spend more quality time together’. \"Plus, pay attention to their perspective and try to understand their reasons for behaving the way they do.”",
