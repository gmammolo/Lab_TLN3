  "text": "DEAR DEIDRE: I CAN’T stop myself sending money and presents to women I meet on sexy sites like OnlyFans. In the past few months, I have gifted these women thousands of pounds. The feeling of giving away my cash and savings so I am totally in their control is orgasmic. But my bank account is starting to empty, and I’m aware that if I carry on doing this, I’ll face bankruptcy . How can I stop when it gives me so much pleasure? I’m a 35-year-old single man with a good job and no dependents. I’ve never told anybody I do this before. Recently, I discovered my need is a fetish that has a name, findom, short for financial domination. Before that, I thought I was the only person in the world who gave away my money for kicks. I’ve always liked giving women presents, much more than receiving them. But it didn’t become an obsession until a few years ago, when I met a woman online who kept asking me for money. While other men would have worried they were being scammed, I discovered I loved it. I fantasised about her bleeding my bank account dry so I had nothing left, and had to go begging to her for handouts. Since then, I’ve found other women to indulge my fetish, some on findom sites. They want things like money, clothes or jewellery . It’s the feeling of being humiliated and under a woman’s power that gives me such a rush. It’s better than sex . But I’m becoming anxious about the future . My lifestyle is already starting to suffer. I can’t afford to go on holiday and I can’t replace my old car. Please help, before I end up in the gutter. DEIDRE SAYS: Findom is not a harmless fetish. Although it has a sexual element, it’s more like an addiction or a form of self-harming – a way of blocking unhappy feelings. And, like a gambling addiction, if you carry on, you could lose everything. In order to overcome this, you need to get to the bottom of why you do it and work on ways to stop. The cause probably lies in your past, perhaps in your childhood. A professional counsellor or therapist could help you. My support pack, Fetish Worries, explains more and gives sources of help. You can also join support group findomaddictsanonymous.org . In the meantime, be honest with your GP about this. They can refer you to professionals and helpful support groups. If possible, cut up your credit cards and set spending restrictions on your bank account. Every problem gets a personal reply, usually within 24 hours weekdays. Send an email to deardeidre@the-sun.co.uk You can also send a private message on the DearDeidreOfficial Facebook page. DEAR DEIDRE : WHEN my daughter left my granddaughter with me and my wife for two weeks so she could holiday with her friends, I was in despair. She had already taken advantage of us many times, expecting us to babysit when she went to work and not even calling to check how her four-year-old child was. We’re in our sixties and were sick of her irresponsible behaviour. Worried for the little girl, we wrote for advice. You agreed that she was being neglectful and acknowledged the effect this might be having on the child. You advised that we tell her how we felt and said to read your support pack, Standing Up For Yourself, to help us have this conversation. In addition, you suggested that we talk in confidence to the NSPCC ( nspcc.org.uk , 0808 800 5000) and read your support pack, Worried A Child Is At Risk?. We took your advice and spoke to our daughter about our concerns, telling her she needed to step up as a mother and communicate better. She admitted she had got in with a bad crowd and that she wanted to turn her life around. We’ve been helping her to do this and she is now in a much better place. Thank you for your kindness and support. DEIDRE SAYS: I’m pleased you were able to talk to your daughter and that she was receptive. Hopefully, things will start to improve and your granddaughter will get the care she needs. DEAR DEIDRE: MY wife gets changed for bed in the bathroom so I can’t see her naked. We now sleep in separate beds and haven’t had sex for five years. I’m going crazy with frustration and I feel so rejected. We’ve been married for almost 30 years and are in our late fifties. We have two grown-up children. Our love life was never a problem when we were younger, although I was always the one to initiate it. But everything changed about seven years ago. My wife started to avoid physical intimacy, making every excuse under the sun. I’d tell her how much I loved her, how beautiful and sexy I still found her, even though she has put on a few pounds, but she said she wasn’t interested. She wouldn’t talk about why. If I asked what was wrong, she would just shout at me and make me feel like a sex maniac. But I’m not – I have a normal libido. Eventually, I was rejected so many times that I gave up trying. I can’t carry on like this, though. I don’t just miss sex, I also miss affection. If I simply try to cuddle up to her on the sofa, she pushes me away. What should I do? DEIDRE SAYS: Your wife has given up on intimacy and refuses to talk about it, which isn’t fair. It’s possible this is linked to the menopause, when many women find their libido decreases and sex can become painful. She may also feel self-conscious about her weight gain. Try talking to her again in a calm moment and tell her that you love her but miss physical intimacy – not just sex, but affection, too. Ask if there’s anything wrong, how you can support her and if she’d be willing to discuss this, perhaps with the help of a specialist counsellor. Read my support packs together on Different Sex Drives and Saving Your Sex Life, and offer her the one on Menopause Problems. DEAR DEIDRE : I HAVE just found out I’m pregnant and I’m already four months along. I’m only 16 and I’m panicking so much about what to do. The baby wasn’t planned. I’m not even with the dad any more, as he broke up with me. My parents are going to be so upset. I’ve just started sixth form. I’m not ready to be a mum, but I think it’s too late to end my pregnancy . Help. DEIDRE SAYS: It’s good you have asked for help. Finding out you’re pregnant is a big shock, but panicking isn’t helpful. I know it’s scary, but please talk to your parents. Even if they’re upset at first, they need to know and should want to help. You still have options, even at four months, but time is of the essence. Make an appointment with your GP to talk them through. My support pack, Unplanned Pregnancy, will direct you to people who can help and advise you. DEAR DEIDRE: SINCE offering to help my friend take care of her teenage son, I’ve become increasingly disturbed by his behaviour. Sometimes, I wake up in the night to find my bedroom door open. My friend and I are both in our early 40s and have known each other for ten years, since our sons were small. Her lad is now 15 and mine is 14. She has recently split from her partner and often works nights, so I offered to let her son stay at my house sometimes. I thought he would be good company for my boy. But he is behaving strangely – he’s very clingy towards me. He always wants hugs and he doesn’t seem to want to go home when it is time to leave. I have no idea what he’s doing at night. Why is he opening my bedroom door? I don’t know how to broach this with her and I’m scared to tell him off as he isn’t my child to discipline. But I now feel very uncomfortable in my own home and am worried about him. DEIDRE SAYS: You’re right to be concerned. Although it’s understandably awkward, you do need to talk to her about this. It might be that he is upset by his parents’ break-up, or dealing with something else that is troubling him. Ask him if you can help with anything and reassure him that he can open up to you. But make it clear coming into your room at night isn’t acceptable. It would also be a good idea to get a lock on your bedroom door.
