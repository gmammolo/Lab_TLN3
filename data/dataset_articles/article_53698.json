  "text": "Garden centre takes fright at urinating dogs\nA garden centre has introduced a ban to stop its Halloween displays being ruined by urinating dogs.\nSouthwood Garden Centre, near Hull, said dogs were no longer welcome in its indoor Halloween and Christmas display areas.\nIn a social media post, management said: \"We've had multiple cases of male dogs marking our displays and products, and, unfortunately, not all owners have taken responsibility.\"\nDogs were still welcome in the plant area, outside areas, coffee shop and farm shops, as long as they were well behaved and under full control, the centre added.\nThe social post continued: \"We love dogs, they're part of the family. But, sadly, due to repeated incidents we've had to make a change.\n\"It's not fair on our team who work hard to keep everything clean and enjoyable for everyone.\n\"We truly appreciate your understanding and cooperation as we try to maintain a magical and clean environment for all our guests.\"\nSmall dogs can be carried through the Christmas section, management said.\nThe restrictions have had a mixed response.\nFormer dog owner, David Hickson, 72, said dogs should be allowed in such premises as long as they are well behaved.\nHe added: \"Maybe it is a bit over the top banning the dogs in those areas [Christmas and Halloween displays]. Maybe [they could] have warning signs up beforehand?\"\nJulie Smith, 57, who owned a Yorkshire terrier for 13 years, said she had no problem with dogs being inside the garden centre.\nShe said: \"Dogs nowadays, especially the small ones, are like children to people [rather] than just pets.\"\nEmma Clark, 41, who owns a beagle and cocker spaniel cross, said the ban did not bother her.\n\"I'm still grateful we can still come and use the facilities, like the cafe and have a wander round and use the play area,\" she said.\n\"I can understand why they do it.\"\nAlan Harrison, 69, was also indifferent.\nBut he added: \"You don't want them weeing all over the stuff.\"\nDog behaviour expert, Pamela Dempsey, said: \"It always comes down to owner responsibility. People don't put in the work to prepare their dog.\"\nListen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.\nDownload the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devices",
