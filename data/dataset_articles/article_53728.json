  "text": "the Chelsea News\n·25 September 2025\nthe Chelsea News\n·25 September 2025\nOne Chelsea players has admitted that he and his team mates played like kids during one recent match in honest assessment.\nChelsea have played badly really in all three of their last games. It might be a bit harsh to say that in the Bayern Munich defeat because they actually didn’t play badly there they just made three silly errors. But in the Manchester United defeat they were awful, and in the Lincoln City win on Tuesday night they were also awful despite winning the tie in the end.\nChelsea were playing a League One side but struggled to beat them. It took a big half time team talk from Enzo Maresca to bring on two quick goals in the second half to turn things around for Chelsea and save a hugely embarrassing result.\nWhilst the result might not have been embarrassing in the end, for me, the performance still very much was. Of course, football is about winning matches and that is what Chelsea did in the end, but even Malo Gusto is saying that they played like kids in this game.\nMalo Gusto against Lincoln. (Photo by Alex Pantling/Getty Images)\nIn words picked up on X yesterday, Gusto said:\n“Of course, in the first-half we played like kids [against Lincoln]. They bullied us in every part of the pitch. It was really bad for us.\n“The second-half was important to come back with more desire, more confidence.”\nI just two two quick vital goals from Chelsea, I didn’t see much confidence so I’m not buying that. I didn’t see a lot of desire either. I just saw Lincoln threatening our goal and looking like scoring an equaliser most of the second half.",
