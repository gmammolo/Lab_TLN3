  "text": "Do you know your lipstick could be doing more than just brightening your smile? That perfect swipe of colour may be adding more than glamour. Recent findings suggest a worrying link between certain ingredients in lipsticks and an increased risk of lung cancer and respiratory problems. With heavy metals like cadmium and lead found in some popular brands, doctors are sounding the alarm—and it might be time to rethink what we’re putting on our lips every day. Some lipsticks may contain lead, while toxic metals like cadmium, beryllium, and thallium also make frequent appearances. These metals are known to be toxic, and some like cadmium, have a direct link to lung cancer. Also Read: World Lung Day 2025: Why lung disease isn’t just a smoker’s problem and how India can close the care gap “Many people don’t realise that the skin on their lips is particularly thin and sensitive,” Dr Geethanjali Patil, Consultant pulmonologist, Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, explains to Moneycontrol. “Toxins from lipsticks can be observed directly into the bloodstream or worse, inhaled or swallowed in trace amounts every day.” This long-term exposure, she adds, may lead to bioaccumulation, where harmful chemicals slowly build up in the body over time, potentially increasing cancer risk and harming vital organs. Dr Patil explains the lipsticks and lungs link: Cadmium is a toxic metal. It is found in more than half of lipsticks tested. It can damage lung tissue, cause chronic inflammation, and raise the risk of lung cancer in both humans and animals Even small amounts of inhaled cadmium can slowly prove dangerous It doesn’t stop at the lungs. Cadmium has also been linked to kidney damage and reproductive issues, particularly in pregnant women. Many lipsticks also contain petroleum-based ingredients to achieve that creamy finish. These can block the skin’s ability to breathe, possibly worsening the effects of toxins. You don’t need to go bare-lipped to stay safe. Luckily, there are safer alternatives. &quot;Look for natural or certified non-toxic lipsticks made with ingredients like beeswax, shea butter, coconut oil, and plant-based pigments,&quot; says Dr Patil. &quot;They offer the same beauty, without the hidden risks&quot;, she adds. You can also try making your own lip colour at home using beetroot powder, cocoa butter, or natural oils—easy, effective, and completely chemical-free. Dr Patil insists, &quot;Read the label. Ask questions. Choose better. The beauty industry must be held accountable for ingredient transparency.&quot; She adds, &quot;But until then, it’s up to us as consumers to make informed choices and protect ourselves.&quot; Also Read: World Lung Day: Pulmonologist busts common myths about lung health FAQs about Lipstick and Lung Health: - What ingredients in lipsticks pose a risk to lung health?
