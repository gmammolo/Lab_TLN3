  "text": "Morgridge Hall, the new cutting-edge academic building on campus is impossible to miss. With 343,000 square feet and seven stories tall, Morgridge Hall makes a bold architectural statement, showcasing the University of Wisconsin’s investment in open concept building design.\nAcross various new campus project — even those outside of UW’s campus — open-concept architecture in university buildings has become popular as dim, compartmentalized lecture halls are replaced with wide-open lounges, glass-walled labs and multi-use spaces. While this kind of architecture appeals to those who favor sleek and modern design, the functionality to all students should be called into question.\nMorgridge Hall opened this fall as the new home for the School of Computer, Data and Information Sciences — merging the three departments into one building. Each floor flows with the theme of open concept student lounges, labs and offices. But, many of these spaces are visible to passersby through glass windows and doors which raises concerns surrounding privacy, focus and comfort.\nFor neurodivergent students living with cognitive differences, open concept academic buildings can have more cons than pros. For some, an open concept encourages collaboration and supports community in workspaces, but for others, having personal space plays a critical role in shaping how they learn and feel on campus.\nWhile this style may be exciting and dynamic for some, it can feel overwhelming or overstimulating for others, especially in a space that forces you to constantly be aware of your surroundings. According to The Cap Times, Ph.D. student Srijan Pandey, who has autism and ADHD, is overwhelmed and overstimulated by Morgridge Hall.\nOpen concept floor plans were popularized in mid-20th century home design and have since infiltrated the workspace. The idea is to knock down walls, create larger shared rooms and let light flow freely through the home. Praised for providing an airy feel and ability to make homes and apartments feel more spacious, open concept floor plans have become a staple of modern architecture, according to HGTV.\nBy the early 2000s, open-concept office spaces had become the norm in many industries with cubicles and private offices torn down to make room for vast floors lined with long desks and minimal barriers. Advocates argued that these spaces would promote collaboration, flatten hierarchies and spark creativity, according to Architectural Digest. The aesthetic matched a Silicon Valley vision of innovation — sleek, minimal and social.\nBut workers quickly discovered the downsides. A 2018 Harvard Business School study found that employees in open-concept offices actually communicated less face-to-face, relying more on email and messaging apps to regain a sense of privacy. Many reported lower productivity and higher stress due to constant noise and distractions. For every employee who thrived on the buzz of activity, another felt drained by the inability to control their work environment.\nThe same dynamics play out in higher education. A student studying in an open lounge might find motivation in the collective energy of peers, but another might feel trapped in a fishbowl, their every movement visible through glass walls. For neurodiverse students, learning differences already shape how they process information and their learning environment can become not just inconvenient, but actively hostile to their ability to succeed.\nA design that signals transparency can instead create self-consciousness and mental fatigue, forcing people to feel on display. For students already struggling with concentration in stimulating environments, a small design choice can mean the difference between productivity and exhaustion.\nThis raises a larger question — who are these buildings really built for? If research shows that open offices reduce productivity for many employees, why are universities repeating the same mistakes with students? Collaboration is valuable, but so are focus and privacy. And for productive learning, conditions matter.\nGiving due credit to the building’s design, Morgridge Hall does include quiet study rooms, which is a step in the right direction. But too often these spaces are treated as add-ons rather than essential features, and oftentimes they must be booked in advance to be used. The message becomes clear — openness is the default and quiet is the exception. That hierarchy leaves behind students who need focus first.\nAs UW continues construction on new humanities and engineering buildings, the university has an opportunity to lead by example. Future campus projects should balance openness with variety. Instead of endless glass walls and sprawling lounges, design should include enclosed study pods, semi-private nooks and acoustically insulated rooms. Ultimately, universities should measure the success of their buildings not by how striking they look from the outside, but by how well they support all students that utilize the facility.",
