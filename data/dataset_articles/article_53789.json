  "text": "The Edmonton Oilers returned to Rogers Place on Wednesday night for a preseason game against the Seattle Kraken. As excited as fans might have been to see many of the team's top stars in action, the game took a backseat to some heartbreaking news.\nEarlier in the day, the team announced that Vasily Podkolzin’s father had tragically and suddenly passed away. The forward will be taking some time away from the team and is heading back to Russia until he's ready to rejoin the Oilers.\nHead coach Kris Knoblauch was asked for his thoughts after the game, and he relayed that it was a difficult day, as the team's heart goes out to Podkolzin. After what was probably the best day of his life — signing a three-year extension with the Oilers — he received the tragic news. Knoblauch talked about how popular Podkolzin is with the team. The guys have a lot of respect for him.\nOn the ice, the Oilers had their chances, but failed to cash in. McDavid and Draisaitl looked dangerous all night, but missed several opportunities to capitalize, as did other Oilers. At the same time, the Kraken took advantage of their fewer chances and handed the Oilers a 4-1 loss.\nDavid Tomasek was active once again, showing his willingness to shoot whenever he had the puck. He wasn't as much of a threat to score, but he did go 70% on his faceoffs and looks ready to play a role on the team.\nAtro Leppanen had another strong game on the blue line. After the game, he said the pace of the NHL is something he's getting used to, but has been happy to see as much action as he's seen so far in preseason. Knoblauch liked Leappane's game and seemed to hint that there is a path to a spot on the team, even if the odds don't favor Leppanen being on the roster.\nDefenseman Atro Leppänen Making Things Interesting For The Oilers\nAndrew Mangiapne picked up the lone marker for the Oilers. When asked for his thought on the game, he responded, “A little sloppy.\" He added, “Good, though, to get the rust off.”\nTrent Frederic didn't have the debut on the top line that he probably would have liked. McDavid and Draisaitl played with Frederic, and while they generated looks, they also passed up some prime shooting opportunities. McDavid hinted earlier this preseason that he might shoot more, but on this night, he leaned on his passing, including a slick pass to Draisaitl that almost resulted in a goal. McDavid wound up with one shot on goal.\nKnoblauch said he would be going back to this top line, even if the stats line didn't favor running it back. The line was a minus three at even strength. That's not a good start.\nOilers' Early 2025-26 Season Projections: The Defense\nJagger Firkus struck first for Seattle late in the opening period, burying a rebound on the power play for the Kraken’s second shot of the game.\nTurnovers haunted Edmonton in the second. Logan Morrison, left alone in front after a mistake at the blue line, deked Stuart Skinner for a 2-0 Kraken lead. By the end of two, the Oilers held a 16-9 shot advantage but couldn’t solve Seattle’s defense.\nMangiapane provided the lone Oilers highlight in the third, finishing a smart Evan Bouchard drive to the net. But Seattle countered with goals from Ben Meyers and an empty-net tally by Jani Nyman to seal it.\nThis was a less than stellar effort by the Oilers, who will try to show more in their game on Friday against the Winnipeg Jets.\nBookmark The Hockey News Edmonton Oilers team site to never miss the latest news, game-day coverage, and more.
