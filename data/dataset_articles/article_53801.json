That the budget for the Fiscal Year July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2026, as categorically evidenced by the Budget Document and the Budget Message be, and the same hereby is, adopted as the Budget of Holt County for said fiscal year.\nSECTION 2. That the offices, departments, activities and institutions herein named are hereby authorized to expend the amounts herein appropriated to them during the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, and ending June 30, 2026.\nSECTION 3. That the income necessary to finance the appropriations made and expenditures authorized shall be provided out of the unencumbered cash balance in each fund, revenues other than taxation to be collected during the fiscal year in each fund, and tax levy requirements for each fund.\nSECTION 4.
