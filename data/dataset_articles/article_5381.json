  "text": "Michigan Senate unanimously passes bills to increase human trafficking penalties\nLANSING, Mich. (WILX) - The state Senate unanimously passed bills Wednesday that would increase the penalties for human trafficking in Michigan.\nCurrently, trafficking is a 10-year felony and/or a $10,000 penalty. The bills would double that to 20 years and/or a $20,000 penatly, with the possibility of life in prison if the victim is a minor.\nOne of the bills would also reduce the potential criminal liability for people caught up in sex trafficking. It would ensure minors cannot be charged with facilitating prostitution and first-time offenders could be sentenced to probation and would have to participate in a mandatory human trafficking awareness program.\nRepublican Sen. John Damoose said he and other lawmakers worked with Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office to create laws that would be more effective at discouraging human trafficking.\n“We’re talking about the worst form of evil,” said Sen. Damoose, “It is a crime that preys on the most vulnerable and takes away every bit of innocence, dignity and freedom from its victims — especially when it involves children.”\nStream News 10 on your favorite devices!
