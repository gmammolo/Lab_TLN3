  "text": "Gut doctor warns about sudden sharp pain in lower belly especially with bleeding, shares 'truth every woman should hear'\nIf stomach pain appears before, during or after meals, it could be related to gut issues. But, pain during sex or around your periods could mean something else.\nHave you wondered whether your abdominal pain is related to your gut or gynaecological issues? There are some signs you should consider to distinguish between different kinds of belly pain. Noticing if your pain is related to meals or your menstrual cycle can help determine the cause – if you notice your abdominal pain more around your cycle, it could be related to gynecological issues. Also read | Surgeon explains real reason 38 year old woman suffered from severe period pain, painful sex\nDr Vivian Asamoah, a gastroenterologist trained at Johns Hopkins Hospital, highlighted this in a September 10 Instagram post, revealing 'the truth about abdominal pain every woman should hear'.\nAccording to Dr Asamoah, sudden sharp pain in the lower belly, ‘especially with bleeding or weakness’, requires immediate medical attention. She said, “Important fact: The uterus itself — just like the liver or brain — has no pain receptors. The pain we feel usually comes from the surrounding tissues — due to spasms, stretching, or inflammation. Here’s how to tell the difference.”\nSigns of gut-related stomach ache\nDr Asamoah shared signs of gut-related pain:\n⦿ Clear link with food: discomfort appears before, during, or after meals\n⦿ Relief after using the bathroom or passing gas\n⦿ Changes in bowel habits: diarrhea, constipation, thin or pellet-like stool\n⦿ Bloating and excessive gas\n⦿ Cramping pain often around the belly button or lower left abdomen\nSigns of gynecological pain\nDr Asamoah also shared the signs of gynecological pain:\n⦿ Tied to your cycle: a few days before your period, during your period, or mid-cycle (ovulation)\n⦿ Radiates to the lower back, sacrum, or rectum\n⦿ Pain connected to sexual activity\n⦿ Often comes with mood changes, discharge, or breast tenderness\nShe concluded, “Red Flag: sudden sharp pain in the lower belly, especially with bleeding or weakness, can be an emergency. Don’t ignore it. Do you notice your abdominal pain more around meals — or around your cycle?”\nNote to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.
