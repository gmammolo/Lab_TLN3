  "text": "Photo: AI-generated image, photo editor: Dastan Shanay\nDigital nomads don’t seem to be rushing to Kazakhstan. Only 27 foreigners have obtained a Neo Nomad Visa since 2024.\nKazakhstan does not appear to be among the most attractive destinations for foreign tourists with remote jobs.\n«Since the launch of the Neo Nomad Visa last year, 27 foreign nationals from 14 countries have had the opportunity to live in Kazakhstan for up to one year,» Kazakh Tourism said.\nMost visas went to citizens of the U.S., Canada, and France. Others receiving the Neo Nomad Visa include nationals of New Zealand, the U.K., Ireland, Singapore, South Korea, Australia, the UAE, Brazil, Latvia and Poland.\nKazakhstan introduced the Neo Nomad Visa for digital nomads in 2024. It allows foreign tourists to work remotely for their overseas employers while living in Kazakhstan and traveling across the country for up to one year. However, the visa does not grant permission for local employment.\nWho is eligible for the visa\n- Citizens of all countries who work remotely with a steady income from foreign sources\n- Family members and dependents of the primary visa holder. Their visas are issued for the same duration as the primary holder’s visa.\nThe visa can be obtained through Kazakhstan’s diplomatic missions abroad.",
