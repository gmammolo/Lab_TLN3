  "text": "Nairobi Man Depressed after Bae of 3 Years Dumps Him with One-Week-Old Baby: \"Ameniblock\"\n- Spencer Mwangi has become a single father by force after his girlfriend left him with their newborn son\n- Mwangi narrated the final moments before his lover of several years decided to quit their relationship, leaving him with the baby\n- Speaking to TUKO.co.ke, the Nairobi man admitted he has been depressed as he struggles to care for his child\nCHECK OUT: You’re One Course Away from Transforming Your Life. Learn Copywriting and Turn Your Passion into Profit\nA young man from Kangundo Road, Saika, Nairobi county, has turned to social media to highlight his plight.\nMwangi found himself in unfamiliar territory after his girlfriend of three years walked out on him.\nHe was left with a newborn, kicking off his fatherhood journey on a sour note with the burden of caring for the little one singlehandedly.\nWhat does Mwangi do for a living?\nRecalling the sequence of events before she left, Mwangi said:\nATTENTION: Tell What You Think About TUKO and Join the Giveaway. Free Access to a Copywriting Course Awaits!\n“When she gave birth at the hospital through normal delivery, I went to see her. I was coming straight from mjengo work, and though I was not looking neat, I went to see her and the baby as a good man. I paid all the bills with the little money I had, and we went home.\nIt was not easy back home because I was struggling financially. I did not have a steady job, and my only source of income was menial jobs and errands. I would either go to mjengo, carry garbage, or unblock sewage to survive. Unfortunately, these kinds of jobs are not consistent.”\nMwangi claimed he had already started noticing red flags in their parenting journey, as sometimes he would come home and find the baby crying because he had not been breastfed.\nHis girlfriend often hurled insults at him and was rude because of the difficult situation at home, until she had had enough.\nMwangi encounters his girlfriend at the gate\n“I remember coming back home from a small hustle when I found her at the gate with the baby. She grabbed me by the t-shirt and uttered hurtful words. She asked me what kind of man I was if I could not provide for her, claiming I had lied to her that I could provide, yet she saw no provision.\nI had to take the baby from her because I feared she might do something regrettable. She told me never to look for her or call her. She walked away and never looked back. She even blocked me,” Mwangi shared.\nAmong the reasons Mwangi’s partner left, according to him, was that they lived in a single-room mabati house, which was also very cold at night.\nHow is Mwangi learning about parenting?\nHowever, he could not understand why all of a sudden things became unbearable for his girlfriend, with whom he had lived for three years.\n“Maybe she thought that with the coming of the baby, we would move to a bigger house, and life would be better. But the truth of the matter is, it got harder. Maybe she couldn’t withstand the difficulty.\nI cannot go for menial jobs because of the baby, I have to care for him. I am learning from YouTube and kind friends. It is hard, I cannot lie. I have been depressed since the baby came because of the responsibility,” he said.\nFinancial contributions can be sent to Mwangi at +254 725 206084.\nNairobi boda rider left with twins\nIn a similar story, a Nairobi boda rider found his two-month-old twins abandoned by his girlfriend on the bed.\nEvans Nyagaka Ogaro was returning from his shift as a boda operator when he found his newborns alone in the house.\nHe opened up about the struggles of raising the children, saying he had to halt his hustle to care for them after the unexpected turn of events.\nJOIN IN: Help Us Grow and Get Rewarded!
