  "text": "RAVENSWOOD, W. Va. (WV News) — A battle of two quality volleyball programs battled in a dual recently — a Little Kanawha Conference Dual, that is.\nBuffalo bested Ravenswood's Devilettes in three sets. After falling in the first set, 25-15. Ravenswood won the second set, 25-22, before Buffalo captured the third, 26-24.\nThe loss dropped Ravenswood to 19-7.\nAnna Casto scored 25 points, went 13-13 serving with two aces and had 33 passes. She also had 42 swings with 17 kills.\nAnnie Starcher had seven points, 84 sets on target, was 13-13 serving with two aces, had two blocks and had two swings with one kill and eight passes.\nMaddie Slater scored seven points, was 13-14 serving with two aces, had five swings with one kill. She had two sets on target.\nHolliday Burrows had six points, 23 swings with six kills and one block.\nKinley Butcher had seven points, 32 swings with six kills.\nAngelena Fowler had one point, 4-5 serving and 30 passes.\nMontana Slater scored three points, was 8-10 serving with one ace and had 16 passes.\nPeyton Mellinger scored two points, one block, had four swings with one kill.\n\"In set one, we were using a new rotation that we had worked on the last couple days,\" head coach Chris Michael said. \"The kids did not execute it well and did not execute rotation substitutions well. It was obvious to me that the rotation was not ready yet, so I switched back to our old rotation for the last two sets.\"\nHe added, \"The last two sets were very competitive. High energy. Lots of back and forth. Lots of long rallies. I was very proud of the team for their overall effort and energy levels.\"\nFor Michael, the disappointing part was that the team just couldn't finish enough plays, and made errors at crucial times throughout the match.\n\"I thought that Buffalo made less errors than we did and finished plays better than we did in the biggest moments of the match. Our service game was good overall, scoring us 15 points, but we did miss back-to-back serves in a crucial part of the last set. Our back row defense was pretty solid, but our block line had a hard time slowing down Buffalo's top two hitters,\" he said.\nMichael said, at this point, it is all about work.\n\"We have to keep working hard in practice! We have to take what we do in practice and apply it to match situations,\" he said.\nMichael added, \"We are getting an opportunity to do something very cool next month. For the first time in the sport of volleyball in West Virginia, the National Guard is doing Military Appreciation and we are a part of it. I picked the Ripley NET match on Oct. 21. Uniforms are coming in Oct. 15.\"",
