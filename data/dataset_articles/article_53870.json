  "text": "By Jessica Thompson ,\n50 minutes ago Actor and director Robert Redford has died at the age of 89 at his home in Utah, reportedly surrounded by family. Redford was celebrated for his iconic roles and directing career, as well as his lasting influence in championing independent film. Redford had also become known for his decades of advocacy on environmental issues.\nRedford won an Academy Award for directing Ordinary People, later receiving an honorary Oscar, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a Kennedy Center Honor.\nRedford founded the Sundance Institute and transformed the Sundance Film Festival into a key platform for independent filmmakers. Redford had produced and directed influential films, including All the President’s Men, A River Runs Through It, and Quiz Show.\nActress Barbra Streisand said, “Every day on the set of The Way We Were was exciting, intense and pure joy.” She added, “We were such opposites: he was from the world of horses; I was allergic to them! Yet, we kept trying to find out more about each other, just like the characters in the movie.”\nActress Robin Wright said, “I mean, what an icon, and his body of work will live on forever. And to be able to be directed by an actor, that was fantastic, and that’s such a rarity. And he’s an icon that’s going to be greatly missed.”\nRedford married Sibylle Szaggars in 2009 and had four children with his first wife, Lola Van Wagenen, two of whom predeceased him.\nPresident Donald Trump said, “I’ll tell you, Robert Redford was great. He had a series of years that he was — there was nobody better.”\nFormer President Barack Obama said, “As an actor, director, producer, and as an advocate, he has not stopped — and apparently drives so fast that he had breakfast in Napa and dinner in Salt Lake.”\nJessica Thompson covers U.S. politics & news for content partner Modern Newsstand LLC.",
