  "text": "July 1, 1963 - September 20, 2025\nJANESVILLE, WI - Thomas Edward Downey, beloved husband, father, brother-in-law, and uncle, passed away suddenly on September 20, 2025. Tom was born in Meriden, Connecticut to Charles and Barbra Downey.\nHe spent his childhood on the east coast developing a love for the ocean, New York pizza and the New York Knicks. He moved to Wisconsin in 1996 and resided in Wisconsin for most of his adult life. He took classes at Blackhawk Technical College and completed the Project Manager program. He married Sallie Hanna on September 28, 1998. They would have celebrated their 27th wedding anniversary on Saturday. Their joy was made complete upon the birth of their son, Grayson Thomas. Tom was a devoted father, a stay-at-home dad and business owner for the first 5 years of Grayson's life. Tom even brought Grayson to Parker High School daily so Sallie could nurse their baby. Tom loved his family, his favorite sports teams and his job as Project Manager with Advantage Homes.\nTom was a master carpenter; even more, he was an artist. He could take an idea or a design and make it his own, adding his own special touch to the finished product. He helped renovate Ortmayer Hall at Trinity Episcopalian Church and completed numerous projects for family and friends. He was creative, detailed, and a true artisan.\nTom's smile could light up a room. He loved to see his friends and family. He also loved planning and cooking meals to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and graduations. No one turned down a dinner invitation when invited and Tom was frequently asked to prepare one of his special dishes.\nFuneral services will be held at 11 a.m. on Monday, September 29, 2025, at FAITH COMMUNITY CHURCH, 2931 Lucerne Drive, Janesville, with Pastor Mike Bachmeyer officiating. Visitation will be held at the church on Monday from 9:30 a.m. to 11 a.m. Please join our family following the service for a luncheon at Faith Community Church until 2 p.m. In lieu of flowers, please consider donating to Grayson's college fund in Tom's honor. His heart overflowed with love and pride for his son and his desire was to provide for Grayson. Burial service will be held on Monday at 2:30 p.m. at Milton Lawns Memorial Park, 2200 Milton Ave., Janesville.\nHenke-Clarson Funeral Home & Crematory is assisting the family. Online condolences can be shared at www.henkeclarson.com.",
