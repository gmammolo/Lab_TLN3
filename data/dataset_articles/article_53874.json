  "text": "> KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 25 — The body of Andi Abdul Ghani Kadir, 41, an editor of the hit animated film Ejen Ali , was found yesterday by a riverbank in Kampung Batu Putih within Kinabatangan\nRescuers discovered his remains at 11.25am near the spot where he was reported missing a day earlier, the New Straits Times reported.\nThe incident unfolded on Tuesday evening while Andi and his 33-year-old wife were travelling by car from Tawau to Kota Kinabalu.\nThe vehicle, driven by his wife, is believed to have skidded off the road, after which Andi exited the car and was last seen near the Kampung Batu Putih bridge.\nKinabatangan Fire and Rescue Station chief Hairi Otuh said they received a distress call at 5.03pm and immediately deployed a four-member team to the scene.\nHe said the site was about 23 kilometres from the station, and the search had to be suspended at 6.52pm due to darkness before resuming the next morning.\nAndi’s body was eventually located along the riverside close to where he was last spotted.\nSocial media users later claimed that Andi and his wife had recently married on Sept 16.\n<",
