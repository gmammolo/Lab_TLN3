  "text": "Aalborg Airport in northern Denmark temporarily suspended all incoming and outgoing flights on Wednesday evening after unidentified drones were spotted in its airspace, according to local police.\nThe drone activity was reported to police at 9:44 p.m. local time. Authorities have not disclosed how many drones were seen.\n“We’re currently unable to comment on the purpose of the drones’ flight in the area or who might be behind it. However, I can say that we are conducting an intensive investigation and intelligence-gathering operation to determine the motives and identify those responsible,” said North Jutland Police Inspector Jesper Bøjgaard Madsen.\nDue to the airspace closure, two planes en route to Aalbord were diverted back to Copenhagen, while another was rerouted to a different airport.\nAt approximately 4:00 a.m. local time, police announced that the drones were no longer present in the airport’s airspace.\nAccording to BBC News, three smaller airports in southern Denmark (Esbjerg, Sønderborg, and Vojens) also reported drone sightings but remained operational. No further details were provided.\nEarlier, on Monday evening, Copenhagen suspended all arrivals and departures due to drone activity in the area. Around 35 incoming flights were diverted to other airports. Police said they did not know where the drones had come from or where they were headed. That same day, an unidentified drone was also spotted over Gardermoen Airport in Oslo, Norway. The airspace over the airport was temporarily closed for several hours.\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen described Monday’s incident as “the most serious attack on the country’s critical infrastructure to date.” She said authorities were still investigating who was behind the drones but did not rule out possible Russian involvement. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the accusations as baseless.",
