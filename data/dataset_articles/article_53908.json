  "text": "Produced by: Manoj Kumar\nYou sip coffee for energy, but your brain has a sneaky backup plan. When caffeine fades, adenosine floods in, making you sleepier than before. Scientists call it a “rebound crash”—and it’s very real.\nDaily coffee lovers might notice the buzz is gone. That’s your brain fighting back, reshaping its chemistry to dull caffeine’s power. The result? More sluggishness, not less, after your morning cup.\nThat late-night latte may feel harmless, but research shows even one evening espresso can fragment your deep sleep. You’ll wake up foggy, wondering why the very drink meant to help left you drained.\nCaramel syrups, whipped cream, and extra pumps may taste divine—but the blood sugar crash that follows leaves you drowsy and craving more. Even black coffee isn’t innocent when it comes to glucose swings.\nCaffeine kicks up cortisol and adrenaline, fueling a short-lived high. But once the surge ends, you’re left flatlined and fatigued. Genetics dictate how fast you burn through this rollercoaster—and why some crash harder.\nThat post-lunch cappuccino seems like the perfect pick-me-up. Hours later, you’re slumped at your desk, betrayed by adenosine rebound and insulin dips conspiring against you. The “afternoon crash” isn’t just a myth.\nDrinking coffee without food can jolt your body into a blood sugar free-fall. Instead of energy, you’re hit with nausea, jitters, and fatigue—proof that timing coffee with meals matters more than you think.\nCoffee acts as a mild diuretic, quietly draining your body’s water reserves. Even slight dehydration triggers fatigue, dizziness, and brain fog—turning your caffeine fix into an unintentional energy thief.\nIronically, the best way to make coffee work again is sometimes to quit. Brief “caffeine holidays” can reset tolerance, letting your next cup deliver the clarity and focus you’ve been missing.",
