  "text": "Fifi makes a strong statement: People are tired of bastard music\nFilloreta Raçi - Fifi was recently invited to \"Pardon My French\", where she revealed more about her life and professional career.\nThe artist has also revealed some secrets about the new album she will bring and more.\nDuring the conversation, she was asked if she now sings for fun, in a period when everything depends on clicks.\nPhoto: YouTube\n\"I felt this pressure until a moment came and I said 'I just have to create music.' Ever since the song \"Zemrën\" I've said that I'm going to start now to only release and make music that I like and not just say 'make a hit,'\" she said.\n\"I'm sorry, but what the hell, how do they know who is a hit and who is not. When I made the most beautiful songs of my life, I said that I wanted to make a good song so that people would listen to me, and I used this until the song \"HANA\". Then I started to be influenced by the market and the bastard smell that music has been giving off in recent years.\"\nPhoto: YouTube\nThe singer from Ferizaj added that she has decided to return to the point where she wants to make music as she feels it and not be influenced by other artists or musical trends.\n\"I don't open my songs to listen to them, to be honest, the songs I listen to are only the new songs that haven't been released yet and I need to open them to see if I need to change something. I listen to them at different times to see if they give me the same emotion again. Are they worth it or not,\" he says, among many things. /Telegraph/\n- YouTube www.youtube.com",
