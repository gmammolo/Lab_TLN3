She came out and got upset with me that I was still up. I told her that I realized that Tuiaki got more conservative as the years went on that he was at BYU. I told her I was so grateful for Jay Hill. She told me I wish you were as grateful for me and the baby as you are for Jay Hill and the BYU defense. I guess I’m going to bed.\nGOCOUGS!\nupperdecky\nPrevious username\nCAROLINACOUG96\nBio page\nupperdecky\nJoined\nJul 9, 2017\nLast login\nSep 24, 2025\nTotal posts\n3,061 (17 FO)\nMessages\nAuthor\nTime\nPosting on CougarBoard\nIn order to post, you will need to either\nsign up\nor\nlog in\n.",
