  "text": "PLEASANTON — Limitless Axes & Ales has closed its Pleasanton location at 1808 Santa Rita Road after almost five years. Its Brentwood and Stockton axe-throwing venues will remain open.\nOwned by Michael and Brook Hill, the business operated in the Valley Plaza Shopping Center. The Hills will continue running Limitless Escape Games next door. It remains open with puzzle-solving and interactive challenges.\n“After an incredible run, our Pleasanton axe-throwing location has officially closed with the conclusion of our lease,” the company posted on its website. “Pleasanton was our very first Limitless Axes & Ales and will always be special to us — the community welcomed us with open arms and gave us a phenomenal experience.”\nThe statement added that the owners are focusing on their Stockton and new Brentwood locations, where they can offer full bar service, live music, larger event spaces and a more complete entertainment experience.\nThe closure comes amid a recent wave of local business departures in Pleasanton. PRIMM Boutique closed in August, Main Street Brewery closed on Sept. 21, and Starbucks announced in July it would not renew its lease.\nThe Pleasanton Limitless venue featured seven lanes, seating areas, a bar serving beer and wine, a lobby and restrooms. Each lane was fenced for safety. The Planning Commission approved the permit, and the City Council gave final approval in 2019.\nThe Hills launched Limitless Escape Games in Livermore in 2016 after a business trip inspired them to open their own escape room, according to the company’s website. Their interest in social and competitive entertainment eventually led them to axe throwing.\nDuring a family trip to New York in 2020, they tried axe throwing for the first time. That experience planted the idea to bring the concept home. Later that year, they opened Limitless Axes & Ales in Pleasanton, a location that quickly became popular for combining axe throwing with a lively social atmosphere and interactive social gaming experiences.\nThe U.S. axe-throwing market is currently worth $163 million, with about 360 businesses nationwide, according to industry data. Industry revenue grew at a reported annual rate of 1.9% to $203.3 million over the five years to 2021.",
