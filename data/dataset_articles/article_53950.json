  "text": "IT'S official: Gen Z is having less sex than their grandparents, according to new findings. 20-year-old model Tanisha Bellucci, from Hertfordshire, explains why her generation is more obsessed with scrolling than snogging. WHEN I heard the news that Gen Z is supposedly having less sex than our parents and even our grandparents ’ generations, my first thought was: absolutely not. But what I’ve realised about my own generation is likely to shock, or even depress, you. Sure, we’re in our prime – our bodies are ready, our energy is high and we should be out there enjoying sex . But a recent poll by sex toy brand Lovehoney found that Brits aged 18 to 26 are only romping an average of 36 times a year – just 0.7 times a week. Meanwhile, the same survey claims our parents, Gen X, are getting it on a staggering 62 times a year. Even our grandparents, the Baby Boomers, are clocking in at 47 times. Millennials, of course, are putting us all to shame, with 73 sex sessions per year. Frankly, it’s embarrassing. People my age are so caught up in our phones – and so obsessed with photographing our bodies – that we’re not actually using them. We’re wasting years chasing Instagram fantasies and giving ourselves ridiculously high expectations. And when we do hook up, it’s often a one-and-done with no real connection. Gen Z has become self obsessed to the exclusion of everything else. I’m living my life, having fun and making memories – and having sex is a part of that. For me, it’s not about waiting for some “perfect” partner that Instagram has decided I need. It’s about connection, confidence and enjoying my prime years. I don’t want to waste my twenties scrolling on TikTok while my parents – or even grandparents – are out-pacing me in bed. How boring is that? Gen Z’s main focus seems to be on the gym , money and ‘self-growth’. Many people my age aren’t even into going clubbing anymore. Instead of downing cheap tequila and stumbling home at 4am, they are now waking up at that hour – and knocking back pre-workout ginger shots instead. It just seems they are focussing on their studies - which is fair, but you are allowed a break - eating healthy, and thinking their ‘night out’ is at the gym with their headphones in. But where is the chance for ‘self-growth’ if you aren’t going out, living a little, and learning from those messy mistakes? I’m living my life, having fun and making memories – and having sex is a part of that Some of the biggest lessons in life come after a bleary-eyed night out, or the end of a bad relationship . Instead, we’re spending so much time looking at what everyone else is doing on social media that our own lives aren’t moving forward. Expectations are sky high, too, even though the luxurious, high fashion lifestyles we see online don’t actually exist. I sometimes hear women my age say men have to pay for their hair , nails and all their ‘maintenance’. But I think that scares blokes off. Personally, I pay for myself and would never rely on a man. A lot of my peers have wildly unrealistic expectations of men, expecting them to bankroll their high-end lifestyles, then seem baffled when they bolt. But can you really blame them? It’s all about the image, with no action behind it. Sure, Instagram can give you confidence, but it’s the fake, filtered kind that fizzles out the second you’re face to face with an actual human. If you spend a lot of time scrolling and nit picking at things you wouldn’t even notice in real life , it can be truly soul-destroying. We get so caught up looking at our phones that we forget to enjoy our real lives. This generation is living a very different life to others and something needs to change. For me, it’s about balance. I document a lot of my life on social media , even posting revealing photos, but I go out and experience life too. I talk to my mum, Carla Bellucci, 44, a former glamour model, about the state of Gen Z living and she doesn’t understand how we’ve normalised things like ghosting people, being toxic online and posting every part of our lives, including our bodies. She always tells me to “put my damn phone away” and just go out and have fun. We get so caught up looking at our phones that we forget to enjoy our real lives. This generation is living a very different life to others and something needs to change I’m telling you, our generation is 100 per cent self-centered. All we care about is how our lives look on Instagram. I’m lucky I can talk to my mum about it and she encourages me to go and live a little. But others don’t have that positive influence and it’s sad, because we’re so young. So many of us are just stuck on our phones, scrolling, scrolling, scrolling. I ditched my job working in a coffee shop when I was 19 to do OnlyFans and I’ve had a lot of strong judgemental opinions from girls my age about it. People think I’ve got no respect for myself, or ‘imagine doing that for money,’ and that no guy will ever take me seriously if I keep posting on there. But why am I being judged for posting bikini and swimwear pictures – the same exact stuff other women post on social media for free? The only difference is, I’m getting paid for it. And while these same girls may have the confidence to take sexy pictures, when it comes to flirting in real life, they haven’t got a clue what to do. What’s the point in teasing online, when in real life you don’t have the same persona? My message to my generation is to stop taking life so seriously and start having fun. You’re only going to be this young – and this hot – once. If that guy wants to take you on a date, go. Don’t be: “Oh, no… I’m not sure.” Just do it, providing it’s safe. My number one message is to take every opportunity and have fun and, for the love of God, stop scrolling . You’re wasting too much time. I’ve realised I’ve wasted so much time looking at other people’s pages when I could be looking good outside, in real life, learning lessons and having fun. My biggest fear is that if this Gen Z self-obsession continues, I won’t be able to find the right person and have a family . Dating nowadays is so difficult. People are constantly talking to – and sleeping with – multiple people. Then they ghost them. Men are always looking for something better, always thinking the grass is greener. They don’t realise that girls heavily edit their pictures and they think that’s what they really look like. So they then get a shock when they meet them in real life. If you’re seeing someone, you just want them to be crazy about you, not constantly looking at pictures of women in bikinis. People should be spending less time scrolling and more time snogging We’ve all gotten so swept up and become almost like robots . But everything is on our phones now – dating, buying clothes, ordering food and even finding a job. When will we actually have a normal life? I, for one, don’t date online. I met the person I’m currently seeing in a normal environment. I was on a night out with friends, and he saw me instantly across a buzzing dancefloor. Our eyes connected and we have been together ever since. We knew exactly where we stood with our connection which is something that wouldn’t happen via the screen of an iPhone. But a lot of people are meeting online, and it’s concerning. Even though this is my generation, I just can’t accept or digest what’s happening. The obsession with our bodies and online image is absolutely insane. People should be spending less time scrolling and more time snogging. ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF. \"The Sun\", \"Sun\", \"Sun Online\" are registered trademarks or trade names of News Group Newspapers Limited.
