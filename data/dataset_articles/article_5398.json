  "text": "Eminence, MO. – The Shannon County Sheriff issued a sincere congratulations to a county citizen who graduated from the court drug program, giving them a chance to change their life for the healthier. The full address can be read below.\nShannon County Sheriff’s Office\nDrug Court Graduation Recognition\nJanuary 28, 2026\nToday, we proudly recognize an achievement that represents determination, accountability, and true personal transformation.\nCongratulations to Jeff Prewett on the successful completion and graduation from the Shannon County Drug Court Program.\nDrug Court is not an easy path. It demands honesty, discipline, responsibility, and the willingness to face life’s challenges head-on without returning to old habits. Participants must meet strict requirements, attend counseling, submit to testing, maintain employment, and remain committed even when the process becomes difficult. Many start the journey — few see it through to the end.\nJeff did.\nI am proud to call Jeff my friend. I have personally witnessed the changes in his life — the renewed focus, the accountability, and the growth in character. His honest work ethic has flourished, and his commitment to building a better future is evident to everyone who knows him.\nPrograms like Drug Court are vital to our community. They hold individuals accountable while giving them the tools to rebuild their lives, strengthen their families, and become productive members of society. Success stories like Jeff’s remind us that recovery is possible and that second chances, when earned, can lead to meaningful change.\nJeff, your hard work, perseverance, and dedication have paid off. This community is stronger because of your success. Congratulations on this outstanding achievement.\nThank you to everyone who plays a vital role in making Drug Court a successful program.\nYour Sheriff,\nSteven Hogan",
