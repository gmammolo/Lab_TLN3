  "text": "Nigeria Entertainment News\nI Feel Guilty Everyday For Not Fulfilling My Late Mother’s Wish – Cubana Chiefpriest\nCelebrity barman, Cubana Chief Priest has shared a personal story about his childhood, his mother’s wishes for him, and how her death changed his life.\nNaija News reports that in a lengthy Instagram post, the socialite explained that his mother longed for a child for over six years before she gave birth to his elder brother, whom she named Onyinyechukwu, meaning “Gift from God.”\nA little over a year later, she had him through several complications and named him Chibuike, meaning “God is my strength.”\nAccording to him, his mother always wanted him to become a Catholic priest because she had promised God that her child would serve in that way.\nHe tried to pursue admission into the seminary but could not continue with the path of priesthood.\nHe revealed that next year will mark ten years since his mother passed away. He said his life took a new turn after her death, as he began to experience great changes in family, friendships, career, and wealth.\nCubana Chief Priest admitted he sometimes feels guilt that he did not fulfill his mother’s dream of becoming a priest, but he believes he is still serving God in his own way.\nTo honour her memory, he announced that he has recorded a Catholic thanksgiving song, produced by Masterkraft and featuring Zoro, which he plans to release soon.\nHe wrote: “Growing up my mom wanted me to be a Catholic priest so bad because she promised God that her child will serve God while she searched for the fruit of the womb for over 6 years. She had my big brother first & named him Onyinyechukwu (Gift from God). Then one year & some months later she had me out of so much complications so she named me Chibuike (God is my strength).\n“I did my best to gain admission to the seminary. But I couldn’t make it to Catholic priesthood because many are called but few are chosen. Next year will make it 10 years I lost my mom & everyone who really knows my real story will testify that after my mom made it to heaven my story changed for good. Everyday I live with the guilt that I disappointed my mama by not becoming a Catholic priest, she wanted to be called Mama Father but rather I became the ChiefPriest.\n“But fact remains that I’m still doing God’s work. I had to do this thanksgiving Catholic Christian song to honor my late mom & also thank God for the numerous blessings that have come my way. I have it all from family to fame, friends, connect, wealth, music etc. Indeed there is joy in my heart & it’s flowing like a river, 1,000 comments only & I will drop this amazing Catholic tune in a bit featuring @zoroswagbag produced @masterkraft_ #MusicNaWater.”\n© 2025 Naija News, a division of Polance Media Inc.
