  "text": "Salman Khan, one of Bollywood’s most enduring superstars, shared a rare glimpse into his personal life on the first episode of talk show Too Much With Kajol And Twinkle. In the premiere episode, where he appears alongside Aamir Khan, Salman spoke candidly about the challenges he has faced in relationships and why he holds himself responsible when things have gone wrong. The actor, who is often in the spotlight for both his professional highs and his personal choices, reflected on how dynamics can shift between partners. “When a partner grows more than the other partner, that is when the differences start coming in; that’s when the insecurity starts setting in, so they both need to grow together. Both need to get off each other’s backs. I believe that,” Salman said. View this post on Instagram A post shared by prime video IN (@primevideoin) His words underline a simple but powerful observation: that compatibility often depends not just on love, but on mutual growth and understanding. For someone who has carefully guarded his private life over the years, this openness struck a chord with viewers who have long speculated about the reasons behind his past breakups. When Aamir pressed him further, Salman doubled down on his accountability, offering an honest admission that sets him apart from many public figures. “Yaar, nahi jama toh nahi jama (If it didn’t work, it just didn’t work out). If there is anyone to blame, I am the one to blame.” Also Read: Sakamoto Days becomes Netflix’s most-watched Anime of 2025, surpassing Demon Slayer and Naruto: Report The statement showcased a mix of regret and acceptance, acknowledging that relationships sometimes fail despite the best intentions. In a world where celebrities often shy away from acknowledging flaws, Salman’s willingness to own his part in the breakdown of his relationships makes his remarks even more striking. This moment of candor provides fans with a deeper perspective on the man behind the action-hero persona. It also sets the stage for Too Much With Kajol And Twinkle, which premieres September 25 on Amazon Prime Video, promising unfiltered conversations with some of Bollywood’s most prominent personalities.\",",
