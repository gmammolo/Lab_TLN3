  "text": "frostburgsports.com\nwebsite\nFrostburg\nSenator Defense Keeps Men's Soccer Attack in Check During Home Loss\n6 hours ago\nFROSTBURG, Md. – The Frostburg State men's soccer team fell to Davis & Elkins at home on Wednesday night by a score of 2-0. After starting the game off with a pair of early corners, the Bobcats gave up a goal off a misplay in the back for a 1-0 D&E lead. The early goal swung the momentum in favor of the Senators, who kept the ball tremendously well against the Frostburg pressure. Holding FSU without a real shot at goal, D&E eventually used a quick free kick down the left side for a nice cut-back with an even better finish to go up 2-0 in the 30th minute of the game. The Bobcats came closest on a flicked header following senior Mateo Cuadros' deep free kick, but it went over the bar with the score holding to halftime.",
