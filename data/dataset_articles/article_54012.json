  "text": "A romantic gesture gone horribly wrong after community members slam the act of love as ‘selfish’ and ‘embarrassing’.\nThe lovelorn graffiti artist quite literally made their mark with a permeant marriage proposal etched into the rock face at a much loved world heritage listed national park.\nA photo posted on social media showed a scenic look-out in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, where a love heart carved into the rocks with the words: “Kiri, will you marry me?”.\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\nWhile we don’t know what Kiri’s answer was, we do know what the response from the community was — overwhelming disappointment.\n“National parks are to preserve. It’s not preserving if everyone is allowed to actively change/alter what’s there on a whim,” one angry local said.\n“People are really out here making marriage proposals, and gender reveals everybody’s problem. Leave no trace or stay out of the woods,” said another.\nOthers were short and sweet with their assessment, “Dude. World Heritage. You’re a w*****”.\nThe decision made by the knife-wielding Casanova may not only be unromantic, but may even be highly illegal according to NSW’s graffiti and vandalism laws.\nThe laws state that graffiti can be made by “any implement designed or modified to produce a mark that is not readily removable by wiping or by use of water or detergent” and carry heavy penalties.\nThe Blue Mountains is a home to some of the state’s most stunning landscapes, as well as environmentally important national parklands.\nIt is also home to a number of historically and culturally significant sites, including indigenous rock carving and art.\nIn NSW, damaging indigenous rock art is an offence under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974, with potential penalties including a maximum fine of $550,000 and the potential for up to 24 months imprisonment for individuals, and a $1.1 million fine for corporations.\nWhile it is unknown if the area was of cultural significance, some social media users decided to see the lighter side of the situation.\n“Yeah, I’m mad today, but in 500 years some nerds are gonna be studying this for a PhD in historical graffiti,” one person said.\n“They clearly have a rocky relationship as it is,” said another.\nNSW National Parks and Wildlife called the behaviour “disappointing” and is “strongly discouraged” within national parks.\nThose visiting national parks are encouraged to leave the areas as they found them.\nStream free on",
