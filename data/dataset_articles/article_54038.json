  "text": "Liverpool's young recruit Giovanni Leoni suffering a season-threatening injury during the Carabao Cup win against Southampton could well become the catalyst for Marc Guehi's arrival to Anfield in January, multiple reports claim. The Crystal Palace captain, who is tracked by Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid, will become a January priority for Liverpool. Giovanni Leoni has suffered an ACL blow which will keep him on the sidelines for months. The seriousness of the knock was confirmed by multiple sources including Fabrizio Romano. \"Liverpool centre-back Giovanni Leoni has torn his ACL and will be out for several months. After an excellent debut in the League Cup last night with Arne Slot also very happy, an unlucky injury for Leoni who will try to be back before the end of the season,\" the transfer expert jotted on X. The youngster's injury means Arne Slot is left with three centre-back options for the season. Joe Gomez, whose fitness issues are no secret, is now the only available direct substitute for regular starters Ibrahima Konaté and captain Virgil van Dijk. Thus, Liverpool, who splashed millions to ensure they defend the Premiership and go a long way in the European competitions, will have to find a player in January. England international Guehi almost joined Arne Slot's team on the deadline day of the summer transfer window. But the deal collapsed as Palace couldn't find a worthy replacement for their captain. His deal runs out in 2026 and if the club is unable to find a suitor in January, they risk seeing him walk off as a free agent in the summer. The FA Cup winners will want to avoid that and will be listening to offers in January. According to the latest reports, Liverpool are ready to be the highest bidders when the window opens so that the Eagles will not be looking elsewhere. While it was reported the summer deal for Guehi was worth £35 million, it was not immediately known how much money was being offered for the centre-back's services under latest circumstances. With Palace really not in a position to be steadfast, the Reds should focus on outbidding Barca and Real.",
