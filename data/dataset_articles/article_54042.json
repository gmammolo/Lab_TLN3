  "text": "Kajol and Twinkle Khanna are all set to welcome Salman Khan and Aamir Khan in Episode 1 of their new talk show, Too Much With Kajol and Twinkle Khanna. In the very first episode of the upcoming series, Salman Khan admitted to asking actresses to \"change\" their clothes and \"come back\" because it can get awkward for the audience. He also spoke about how women should find their way in a man's world when questioned on the subject. Salman added a humorous touch to his answer when Twinkle Khanna asked him about equality between men and women. He said, \"Kitchen mein bhi hum logon ko daal diya. Har kitchen ka chef, har ghar ka chef, aadmi hai bhai .\" Kajol responded by pointing out that male chefs still get compensated with salaries, while women continue to do household chores without pay. Salman carried on the banter by asking Twinkle Khanna and Kajol if they cooked at home. He remarked, \" Aapke ghar mein 2 males hain (Ajay Devgn, Akshay Kumar) jo ke aap logon se dominated hain .\" Twinkle concluded by saying that while this instance might be true, it does not hold true on a larger scale. In the same episode, Salman Khan opened up about his past relationships and expressed his wish to have children one day. The actor revealed, \"Children, I will have, one day, soon. It's just that eventually one will have kids, but let's see.\" Kajol and Twinkle Khanna are set to bring some exciting guests to their talk show, Too Much With Kajol And Twinkle. Their very first guests, Salman Khan and Aamir Khan, ensured the premiere held plenty of candid and entertaining moments. Salman was at his most unfiltered as he spoke about his wish to have children, his past relationships, and his request for actresses on his sets to make considerate outfit choices.
