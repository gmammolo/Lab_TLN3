  "text": "Novak Djokovic issues heartbreaking statement after death of 'tennis father'\nNikola Pilic, who reached a French Open final and played in a Wimbledon doubles final before retiring in 1978, was one of the key men behind Novak Djokovic's rise to supremacy\nNovak Djokovic has released a heartfelt statement following the death of his 'tennis dad' Nikola Pilic at 87. The former tennis star, who reached a French Open final and played in a Wimbledon doubles final before retiring in 1978 after a decade-long career, later turned to coaching and was instrumental in Djokovic's rise to dominance.\nPilic took Djokovic under his wing when he was just 12 years old, allowing the young Serb to train at his tennis academy. Nearly four decades later, Djokovic continues to appreciate the impact his Croatian mentor had on his life and career.\nResponding to the news of Pilic's passing, Djokovic posted an emotional statement on X (formerly Twitter), expressing a sense of 'emptiness'.\nThe statement read: \"Dear Mr Niko, I received sad news today while I was on the court, finishing my training. A feeling of emptiness and sorrow overwhelmed me.\n\"I hope you felt how much you meant to me in my career and life. Your impact on my development as a person and a tennis player remains indelible.\n\"I feel eternal gratitude to you and your wonderful wife Mia for accepting me as your own son when I was 12 years old. My parents and brothers have always felt you as a member of the family.\n\"When almost everyone turned their backs on us and while our country was being devastated by bombing, Mija and you extended a hand of support to us and did everything in your power so that my brothers and I could continue to live our dream and engage in the sport we love.\n\"Thank you for all the moments that relived in my mind today and that will remain etched in my memory for as long as I. Alongside the sadness and mixed emotions I feel, your image and memories of our shared moments bring joy and gratitude to my heart.\n\"Your legacy will endure for a long time, and will look back on your persona and achievements with great admiration. All your accomplishments as a player, coach, and selector are inscribed in golden letters in the books of Balkan and world tennis history. For me, however, the most important thing is that I can proudly call you 'Mr Niko, my tennis father'. Rest in peace.\"\nDON'T MISS:\nPilic undoubtedly played a pivotal role in molding Djokovic into the champion he became. Three years ago, he hailed his student as the greatest of all time and implied that many in the western world were troubled by his achievements.\n\"I think his success has hurt the West in a different way,\" Pilic told Croatian media. \"By their understanding of things, the level Djokovic has reached was reserved for someone from the West.\n\"And then comes a guy from a small country to dominate the world of tennis. Had Roger Federer done what Djokovic did at the US Open in 2020, he would not have been disqualified. [The West] has a problem with Djokovic being the best.\"",
