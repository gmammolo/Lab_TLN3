  "text": "It was a battle between two seven-win boys soccer teams, but only one would prevail.\nUltimately Chardon’s three-game winning streak came to an end on Saturday after Aurora (8-1-2) defeated the Hilltoppers 5-2.\nThe loss was only Chardon’s third on the year, sitting at 7-3-1 after Sept. 20. The team expected a fight but were outmatched.\n“We kind of knew that was their approach to hash,” Chardon Coach Mike Smith said. “They like to come out strong; they like to score early; we just couldn’t stop them.”\nLast year was a successful one for Chardon, going 13-4-1. The Hilltoppers have picked up where they left off and a big part of that is due to the vast amount of experience the team has.\n“This year we have about seven senior starters, so that’s helpful,” Smith said. “We have been doing a good job lately of just playing as one, communicating, shifting, we needed to find feet more today, but overall, finding feet well, making dynamic runs and getting some balls in back of the net.”\nEven though the results might not have shown it, the strength of this Chardon team comes from the defense. A strong junior goalie in Gus Schneider stands out with talented defensemen in senior Luke Vucetic and Austin Seese and midfielders sophomore Jordan Higham, senior Evan Medved and senior Dylan Schneier.\n“Our back line, especially our core on the third to center back, we have Jordan [Highman] right in front as the mid and then Gus [Schneider] in the back builds a wall,” Smith said. “They played a lot of minutes last year. Their communication is there. The chemistry is there. We just have got to keep our minds right for the next game, move forward and concede less.”\nAurora scored early into the game. It wasn’t until a little more than two minutes remaining that Chardon senior forward Anthony Catania connected on a goal. Shortly after Aurora regained the lead.\nThe Greenmen wasted little time in the second half, pouring on two back-to-back goals. Sophomore forward Will Monkiewicz connected on a goal, but Aurora scored once more to put the game out of reach.\nNow it’s about moving on and gathering momentum as the season progresses.\n“Just take it one game at a time,” Smith said. “Look to learn and improve through wins and losses. Nobody plays a perfect game. We can do what we can after each game to learn and improve. We’ll be set up come playoff time.”",
