  "text": "Love may be priceless, but in China, a businesswoman has learned the hard way that it can cost millions and still end in heartbreak.\nThe businesswoman in Chongqing, surnamed Zhu, fell for her much younger married subordinate, He. Smitten, she paid three million yuan (Rs 3.72 crore) to facilitate his divorce and compensate his wife, Chen. The deal was simple: Chen would walk away with money for herself and child-rearing expenses, while Zhu and He could start fresh together.\nFor a year, the pair lived as lovers. But soon, reality replaced infatuation when Zhu realised she and He were not compatible after all. Their romance fizzled and suddenly, she wanted her money back., SCMP reported\nTaking her lover and his former wife to court, Zhu demanded the return of the funds. At first, the court sided with her, calling the money an “invalid gift” since it violated “public order and good customs.” The ruling ordered Chen and He to repay the full amount.\nBut the story didn’t end there. On appeal, a higher court flipped the decision, ruling that the money was not a gift but a payment made on behalf of He for divrce compensation and child-rearing expenses. Zhu was criticised for lacking integrity after willingly funding the divorce and then trying to undo it once the relationship soured.\nOn social media, the case sparked outrage and mockery. “It is absurd to spend three million yuan to facilitate a male subordinate’s divorce,” one user scoffed. Another wrote, “She broke someone’s marriage and now wants a refund?” Others poked fun at Chen’s unexpected windfall, “Find yourself a handsome husband. Who knows, maybe a rich boss will pay millions for him!”\nClick for more latest Viral news. Also get top headlines and latest news from India and around the world at News9.",
