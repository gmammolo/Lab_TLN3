  "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 29 (Bernama) -- The Petrol Dealers Association of Malaysia (PDAM) has expressed its full support for the government’s move to expand enforcement against subsidised RON95 petrol misuse to include drivers of foreign-registered vehicles from April 1.\nIn a statement today, PDAM pointed out that violations involving foreign vehicles often go unpunished, as they are rarely caught in the act. Instead, they are typically exposed only after video evidence goes viral or CCTV footage is circulated.\n“Shifting liability to the buyer has long been our position. For the first time, the real perpetrators, drivers who knowingly misuse subsidised fuel, can be held directly responsible,” the association said.\nPDAM also endorsed firm action against petrol station operators who knowingly sell subsidised fuel to ineligible customers.\nHowever, it argued that the responsibility for enforcement must lie with the authorities, as operators do not have the authority and lack the practical ability to verify every vehicle, especially at busy stations.\nPDAM emphasised that penalties must be fair and based on clear intent, noting that operators acting without intent or knowledge face substantial fines of between RM1 million and RM1.5 million.\nTherefore, drivers who deliberately violate the rules by hiding their vehicle’s registration or providing false details should also face proportionate penalties that reflect the seriousness of their offence.\nThe association further expressed concern over reports of exploitation, including the use of doctored images and fake foreign number plates, as well as extortion attempts that take advantage of the current enforcement gap. Several operators have already lodged police reports regarding these incidents.\nPDAM supports implementing technology-based enforcement, such as systems that automatically detect foreign vehicles and restrict them from purchasing RON97.\nHowever, if this proves too costly or impractical, the association urges authorities to focus enforcement on high-impact leaks, specifically, organised smuggling syndicates and large-scale fraud.\n\"We are not asking for softer enforcement, but for enforcement that is fair, practical, and based on real economic impact,\" PDAM concluded.\n--BERNAMA\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial",
