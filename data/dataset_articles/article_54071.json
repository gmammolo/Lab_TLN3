  "text": "LOS ANGELES, California — William Shatner, the actor famous for his portrayal of Capt. James T. Kirk on “Star Trek,” was rushed to a hospital Wednesday because of a medical emergency, reports say.\nTMZ reports that Shatner, 94, was at his home in Los Angeles when he “experienced an issue” with his blood sugar. An ambulance was called to his home as a precaution, sources tell TMZ.\nShatner was “resting comfortably” at a hospital, according to TMZ.\nThe beloved actor started his career in 1951 with small roles in numerous TV shows, with one of his most famous being in an episode of “The Twilight Zone” in which he portrays an airline passenger who can see a creature on the wing of the plane tampering with the engine.\nIt was in 1966 that he began a three-season run as Capt. Kirk on “Star Trek.” The show was not a hit during its first run, but became hugely popular in reruns and resulted in several successful movies in the 1980s and early 1990s.\nWhile he’s had significant roles in other TV series such as “T.J. Hooker” and “Boston Legal,” he remains most connected with the Kirk character. His most recent credited acting role was in the 2024 TV miniseries “765874″ in which he again portrayed Kirk.",
