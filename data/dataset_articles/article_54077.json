  "text": "By Evolve Editors ,\n38 minutes ago Photo Credit: Gregory Shamus/Getty Images) Kylie Jenner wants to take the next step with Timothée Chalamet after 18 months of being together. However, reportedly, the actor is enjoying his freedom. And while Chalamet loves being independent, he also doesn’t want to push Jenner away by being “noncommittal.”\nKylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet’s future in a fix as they navigate long distance relationship, hints source Kylie and Timothée began dating in 2023, and the romance appeared to be strong. Recently, though, things took a different turn as Jenner struggled to spend a month apart from Chalamet, when he had to film his upcoming film, Dune: Part Three, in Budapest. The separation was rigid for the socialite, which led her to fly 6,000 miles to meet the actor and discuss their future.\nThe couple spent nearly one month apart from each other, and the experience was reportedly “tough” on Jennerr. Rumors suggested that Chalamet was having a great time without her, partying with the crew during breaks.\nRadarOnline recently reported that the 28-year-old was deeply “affected by social media rumors.” And so when the Dune actor had time off, she flew to him, “asking for reassurances” and asking about “how things will work” when he gets back to the United States.\nThe insiders claimed that Jenner doesn’t want to pressure Chalamet into proposing to her. However, she does want to move in with him and is ready to cover up the expenses for the same. And while the 29-year-old loves his independence, he, too, doesn’t want to push away the reality TV star by being “too noncommittal.”\nWhile their romance appears rock-solid, tensions still linger. Sources claim Timothée’s family disapproves of his relationship with a member of the Kardashian family. The Interstellar actor, too, is allegedly struggling to match the makeup mogul’s luxe lifestyle.\nAn insider claimed that both Kylie and Timothée love “high-end experiences” and they have “bonded on expensive trips and vacations.” However, Chalamet allegedly feels the burden of maintaining Jenner’s lifestyle. According to insiders, the actor is extremely proud of his achievements and doesn’t want to rely on the socialite’s fame or wealth. However, per the tipster, he knows the relationship would be “done” if he ever shows insecurity.\nFor now, Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet are navigating the ups and downs of their relationship, and fans eagerly await seeing what happens next.\nOriginally reported by Chhavi Puri on Reality Tea .\nThe post appeared first on .",
