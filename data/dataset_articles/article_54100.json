  "text": "Passengers flying to, from, or within Italy are likely to face travel disruptions on Friday, September 26, due to ongoing air transport strikes. Staff walkouts at Wizz Air and Volotea are expected to affect multiple domestic and international flights, particularly at major airports like Rome Fiumicino and Milan Malpensa, according to a report by The Local Italy. Travelers are advised to check flight schedules and prepare for delays or cancellations.Air transport unions have planned these strikes to protest working conditions and pay disputes. Historically, strikes in Italy’s aviation sector have led to widespread disruptions, impacting thousands of passengers and causing operational challenges for airlines. Airports may see longer queues at check-in counters and security checkpoints, as reduced staffing affects boarding and baggage handling processes.Wizz Air and Volotea passengers are being urged to monitor official airline communications for the latest updates. “We recommend travellers arrive at the airport early and confirm their flight status before leaving for the airport,” a spokesperson from Volotea said, as reported by The Local Italy. Airlines may rebook passengers on alternative flights, but options could be limited due to the simultaneous nature of the strikes.The Italian Civil Aviation Authority has taken into consideration that while essential flights, such as medical or emergency transport, will continue, most commercial operations will face delays. Travelers with connecting flights should anticipate potential ripple effects across Europe, as cancellations in Italy could disrupt onward travel.This strike follows a series of labour actions in Italy’s transport sector, including recent rail and metro disruptions. The government has urged unions and airlines to seek dialogue to minimize inconvenience to the public. In addition, airport operators are taking steps to ensure passenger safety and maintain essential services despite the reduced workforce.For passengers planning travel on Friday, staying informed through airline notifications and airport advisories remains critical. Contingency plans, including flexible booking options and travel insurance, may help reduce the impact of potential delays. Travelers are encouraged to plan extra time for airport procedures and anticipate longer waits at check-in and security areas.Italy’s air transport strikes highlight ongoing tensions in the aviation industry over labour conditions and pay, underscoring the importance of proactive communication between airlines, employees, and passengers to manage disruptions effectively.",
