  "text": "By Ritika Singh ,\n37 minutes ago (Photo Credit: Mark Sagliocco | WireImage via Getty Images) It has been years since Kim Kardashian and Kanye West parted ways. The two began dating in 2012 and were married on May 24, 2014. After endless speculations, they were officially divorced in 2022. A source has now revealed that the rapper was controlling the beauty mogul during their relationship. Additionally, Kardashian is ready to open up about their marriage.\nKim Kardashian was living under Kanye West’s shadow and that broke her, says source As per Rob Shuter’s #ShuterScoop , Kim Kardashian is ready to spill the truth about her marriage to Kanye West. One insider stated, “Kim has been sitting on this for years.” The 44-year-old is reportedly “ready to tell her side — the controlling behavior, the meltdowns, the fashion fights, all of it.” They further added, “She feels like she’s earned the right to reclaim her own story.”\nDuring their marriage, the musician used to allegedly control the businesswoman’s clothes, throwing hundreds of shoes and scrutinizing her every look. However, sources shared that this was just the beginning. One more insider shared, “Kim lived under Kanye’s thumb.” The individual added, “It nearly broke her.” Now, Kardashian is doing great in life after subtly taking a dig at West on her French Vogue cover. Additionally, she has been thriving in her professional life.\nThe source explained, “She doesn’t want to trash him just for headlines.” However, “she does want people to understand what she went through.” With the SKIMS founder thriving in her 40s, West might face his truth soon. An insider exclaimed, “This won’t be pretty,” and added, “Kim is finally ready to speak.” Recently, it was also reported that Kardashian is worried about the musician’s documentary, “In Whose Name?,” ruining her image.\nAn insider told The U.S Sun her “biggest nightmare is having something that is deeply personal, like video footage, out there in the world that she has no control over.” The source further explained, “[Kim’s] entire career has been about her very carefully building this perfect image.” Revealing that “Kanye’s documentary has her in a spiral,” the insider continued, “Her team were ordered to get an advance copy.”\nThe post appeared first on .\n1",
