  "text": "PORTA/A-C/Greenview varsity football team lost a road game to the Trojans of Maroa-Forsyth by a score of 53-0 Friday night.\n“That is a very good football team we just faced,” said head football coach Lonnie McAnally after the game.\n“They are certainly worthy of their state ranking” he added. “But our guys had fun in this one and everybody played hard. We were able to keep our players healthy and fresh by getting all of the boys a lot of reps,” McAnally said about the game.\nStatistically, defensive tackle Leland English recovered a Trojan fumble for the Bluejays. Offensively, quarterback Lane McAnally completed three passes on the night and Lucas Kinney completed one.\nWill O’Brien, Logan Baker and Drew Carter all caught passes for the Bluejays.\nAnd linemen like Mason Huebner and Jon Collins provided some solid blocking upfront. “Now it is time to come back to our place next week and protect our home turf,” McAnally said. The Bluejays will face off against the Cardinals of Pleasant Plains in their annual Homecoming game this Friday evening.",
