  "text": "If there’s one institution I can point to that has for the most part stood firm and limited the chaos coming from this administration, it is the court systems with the notable exception of SCOTUS.\nJudges from all sides of the aisle, appointed by both republicans and democrats have really stood up against some of the most severe abuses of this administration. They have in many cases through their filings been voices of reason. And I don’t think they’ve received the thanks they deserve.\nThere are some lawyer firms and lawyers grinding away it seems 24 hours a day picking up clients for free, defending the detainees and immigrants, the victims of ice… relentlessly with very little recognition. Refusing to accept the administrations “offers” of dominance.\nThere are the communities, rallying around their neighbors, bringing them food and meds, warning them of incoming raids. They face constant threats from this administration too yet they persist.\nThere are businesses standing strong with their employees and communities!\nThere are whistleblowers trying to tank the system from inside!\nThere are the committees holding hearings, outing the absurd stance of the regime. Always under attack and threats.\nThe real message here is that there are real people, standing up unseen for the most part, putting it all at risk to protect us from the worst this regime would unleash upon us.\nI see you, I appreciate you, I thank you\n#TheAmericanHaitianPoet Paypal.me/murielvieux (out of meds)\nMuriel Vieux – January 29th, 2026 – ©All rights reserved",
