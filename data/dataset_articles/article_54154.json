  "text": "Without glasses or contacts, I cannot see. I am nowhere near the point of being legally blind, but without some sort of corrective lenses, I can’t read or drive or do most everyday activities.\nI started wearing glasses in middle school. By my junior year of high school, I had finally convinced my mom to let me start wearing contacts, and my face was once again free from the confines of my large, round glasses. Since then, I have worn contacts almost daily, wearing my glasses only as a backup option.",
