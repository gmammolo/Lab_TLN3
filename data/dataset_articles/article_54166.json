  "text": "Reports suggest Deepika Padukone left Kalki 2898 AD 2 after filming 20 days, citing pay and schedule disputes.\nActor Deepika Padukone has officially stepped away from the highly awaited sequel of Kalki 2898 AD. Production house Vyjayanthi Movies confirmed the news with an official statement, saying they were “unable to find a partnership” with the actor despite the long journey they had together while making the first film.\nWhat makes her exit even more striking is that Deepika had already shot nearly 20 days for the sequel before she walked away. According to a News18 report, her team’s claim of “date clashes” does not stand because her schedule for the project was always meant to be finalized mutually. Sources further revealed that she was fully aware of the sequel, and that her character had a strong, performance-driven role. Even director Nag Ashwin had mentioned in earlier interviews that Deepika had filmed portions of Part 2 while shooting the first instalment.\nReports also suggest disagreements over pay and working hours may have caused the fallout. As per NDTV, Deepika demanded a 25% increase in her acting fee compared to Part 1. She also wanted to limit her daily shoot time to 7 hours. Producers offered her the comfort of a luxury vanity van for rest breaks if she agreed to longer hours, but she declined. Additionally, she asked for five-star stays for her 25-member crew, which the producers found difficult to manage.\nIn their official statement on X, Vyjayanthi Movies shared: “This is to officially announce that @deepikapadukone will not be a part of the upcoming sequel to Kalki 2898 AD. After careful consideration, we have decided to part ways. A film like Kalki 2898 AD deserves that commitment and much more. We wish her the best with her future works.”\nThe first film, released in 2024, turned out to be a massive global hit. Featuring Amitabh Bachchan, Kamal Haasan, Prabhas, and Disha Patani alongside Deepika, it collected around Rs 1100 crore at the worldwide box office. With its futuristic setting and striking visuals, it was hailed as a milestone for Indian science fiction on the big screen.\nEven as she exits the franchise, Deepika has a packed line-up ahead. She will soon be seen alongside Allu Arjun in Atlee’s next film AA22xA6, marking her first collaboration with the Telugu superstar. She is also working on King, directed by Siddharth Anand, which stars Shah Rukh Khan, Suhana Khan, and Abhishek Bachchan. Shooting for King is already underway.\nWith her exit, fans are now left curious to see who will step into her role in Kalki 2898 AD 2, and how the makers will reshape the sequel without one of its most prominent faces.\nAlso Read:\nAlso Read:\nDeepika Padukone Confirms Role in King, Shares a Heartwarming Click With Shah Rukh KhanNext Story",
