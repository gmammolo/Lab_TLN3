  "text": "Showers are expected to continue as fast-moving fronts pass over today and Friday.\nIn its latest weather update, MetService said these fronts build a line of heavy showers, with the risk of thunderstorms for the South Island, and hail about Canterbury and North Otago today.\nSnow is also expected to affect some mountain roads.\n“During spring, fronts line up like waves in the sea. There will be blustery northwesterly winds and decent showers, especially for western parts, as each one rolls through,” MetService meteorologist Michael Pawley said.\n“As winds strengthen, the swell will also pick up, so keep a close eye on the marine forecast if you’re looking to take the boat out.”\nOn Saturday, the All Blacks face Australia at Eden Park for the first Bledisloe Cup test.\nWhile it looks like a sunny morning, fans might want to keep a raincoat on hand for the line of showers that will move across Auckland during the afternoon and evening, with possible thunderstorms and strong wind gusts.\nOn Sunday, the clocks spring forward for Daylight Saving, and another burst of rain with strong northwesterly winds moves over the South Island.\n“Sunday looks to be a great set up for warmer temperatures in eastern regions thanks to the Foehn effect,” Pawley said.\n“This happens when rain falls on the West Coast and Southern Alps, it releases heat, the warm dry air then descends on the Canterbury Plains. This Foehn wind mirrors what occurs in the Alps of Europe.”\nChristchurch and Kaikōura are forecast to have a maximum temperature of 21C on Sunday, along with Tauranga.\nNapier and Hastings are expected to get to 24C.\nMetService said there is a glimmer of hope for parents hoping to send the kids outside early next week as the weather settles briefly under a ridge of high pressure.",
