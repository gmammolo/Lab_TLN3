  "text": "Despite our daily doses of internet outrageousness, we sometimes still manage to find random content that surprises us. Recently, a housecleaner who lives in Tampa, Florida experienced one of those moments. When she came across a jewelry maker incorporating semen into the bead-making process, it caught her too off guard to simply scroll on by.\n@msartteacher What did I just watch?!?!?\n♬ original sound – Jenni Jenni is a Florida business owner, and runs the TikTok channel @msartteacher . While using social media, she stumbled upon both figurative and literal internet gold. A jewelry maker using sperm to make her custom pieces had uploaded video content with some shocking claims:\nJizz and rainbows are always the perfect combination.\nNaturally, Jenni kept watching. Who wouldn’t, after that opening line? The jewelry maker, whose location and social media information Jenni did not share, proceeded to break down her offbeat bracelet-making process.\nIn the clip, she shares that her client had requested pastel rainbows and gold foil bits. The customizations were paired with the sperm the same client sent in. Yes, that’s correct: customers send in a sample of semen to curate their jewelry experience.\nThe jewelry maker specified that she receives all the semen as liquid. She then turns it into a powder and mixes it into her clay. Lastly, the clay is made into the beads needed for the jewelry. This time, it happened to be what she called a “simple beaded bracelet on an elastic.”\nSemen Jewelry Shocks And Awes Floridian Jenni did not provide commentary when sharing the bracelet tutorial. Yet her facial expressions and caption ( What did I just watch?!?!? ) said more than most verbal reactions. And viewers were eager to fill in the blanks.\n“Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should,” a viewer named Erin chimed in.\nAnother person pointed out the jewelry maker’s lack of gloves. Jenni agreed, both appalled and surprised that any professional working with semen would use her bare hands in the process.\nWhile others in the comments said they’ve seen this woman making sperm jewelry for years, nobody shared her identity. After some digging, it seems she may be Amanda Booth on TikTok. Her channel, @amandaldbooth , lists her as a specialist in sentimental pieces, and the tattoos on her fingers seem to match the evidence Jenni posted on her feed.",
