  "text": "Bobcat golfers slide to 10th at Southeast Polk\nPLEASANT HILL — A third meet in as many days was just too much for the Marshalltown boys’ golf team.\nThe Bobcats couldn’t keep up with the competition at the Southeast Polk Invitational on Wednesday morning, settling for 10th place out of 11 scoring teams at Copper Creek Golf Club.\nPlaying 47 competitive holes of golf in three days caught up to Marshalltown, which wore down and scored a 336 composite. The Bobcats shot a 311 on Monday at Willow Creek Golf Course in West Des Moines and on Tuesday tallied a 152 at Highland Park Golf Course in Mason City.\nA third-straight day of travel took its toll.\nIndianola won the meet with a 295 team total, followed closely by Norwalk (298) and Dowling Catholic (299). The Bobcats were just back of ninth-place Urbandale (333) but well ahead of Fort Dodge (358).\nMarshalltown sophomores Joe Greazel and Gavin Misek tied for the 23rd best score of the tournament after both shot 8-over-par 79s. Parker Christen came away with an 85, while fellow junior Jacob Seberger shot 93 to round out the Bobcats’ scoring. Bryson Payne (95) and Trae Misek (101) also competed for MHS.\nMarshalltown gets some reprieve before going to Des Moines next Tuesday for the Iowa Alliance Conference meet at A.H. Blank Golf Course. The Bobcats are four-time defending conference champions.\nSoutheast Polk Invitational\nCopper Creek Golf Club, par 71\nTeam Standings — 1. Indianola 295, Norwalk 298, 3. Dowling Catholic 299, 4.
