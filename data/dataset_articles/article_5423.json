  "text": "15m Nigerians use drugs as Ondo records 336 arrests, 22,316kg seizures, says Marwa About 15 million Nigerians aged between 15 and 64 use drugs, nearly three times the global average, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brigadier-General Mohamed Buba Marwa (rtd.), has revealed.\nMarwa made the disclosure on Monday during a courtesy visit with his delegation to Ondo State Governor, Dr Lucky Orimisan Aiyedatiwa, at the governor’s office in Akure.\nPresenting comprehensive data on drug use prevalence, enforcement outcomes and cannabis production across the country, with particular emphasis on Ondo State, Marwa cited the 2018 United Nations drug use survey, stating that one in every seven Nigerians in the age bracket consumes drugs, describing the figure as unacceptably high.\nAccording to the NDLEA chief, drug use prevalence in Ondo State stands at 17 per cent, translating to roughly 400,000 users.\nHe compared this with 33 per cent in Lagos State, about two million users and 24 per cent in Oyo State.\nProviding operational figures, Marwa disclosed that in 2025 alone, the NDLEA command in Ondo State made 336 arrests, seized 22,316 kilogrammes of illicit substances, and secured 62 convictions.\nHe added that 207,000 kilogrammes of cannabis were seized and destroyed from farms and plantations across the state within the period.\nThe NDLEA chairman also revealed that the agency’s counselling and rehabilitation centre in Ondo State treated 243 drug users last year, describing Ondo as the highest producer of cannabis in Nigeria, due to favourable climate and soil conditions.\nMarwa added that the NDLEA had commissioned the Nigerian Academy of Science to conduct a scientific study on cannabis-extracted oil for medicinal purposes, stressing that any decision on controlled cultivation and export would be strictly evidence-based.\nThe NDLEA boss said the agency had established an Alternative Development Unit at its headquarters to complement law enforcement by engaging cannabis-growing communities to switch from illicit cultivation to legal crops.\nThe strategy involves community development, provision of farm inputs, infrastructure, schools, clinics and access to markets to ensure sustainable livelihoods, he said, adding that Ondo State has been selected for a pilot study of the programme following a year of engagement with cannabis-producing communities.\nMarwa also highlighted the Ondo State Government’s backing, including the creation of a State Drug Control Committee, with plans to extend it to local government areas, as well as provision of financial and operational support for the command.\nCommending the governor for receiving the delegation despite competing responsibilities, Marwa said the engagement demonstrated state-level commitment to addressing drug abuse and trafficking, which he described as critical to the success of national efforts.\nResponding, Governor Aiyedatiwa pledged the full support of his administration to the NDLEA following the launch of the agency’s Alternative Development Programme in Ondo State.\nHe commended Marwa for personally leading the programme rather than delegating it, describing the move as a demonstration of commitment to curbing illicit drug cultivation, production, trafficking, and consumption.\nHe praised the NDLEA for complementing enforcement with the initiative, which would provide farmers with alternative livelihoods.\nThe Governor thanked the agency for selecting Ondo State as the pilot for the programme, noting statistics showing the state as the largest producer of cannabis in Nigeria.\nHe added that Ondo is also a major producer of legitimate agricultural products, such as cocoa, due to its vast forests, fertile soil and favourable climate. While the majority of residents are law-abiding, some still engage in illicit cultivation.\nGovernor Aiyedatiwa assured the NDLEA of government support, recalling past assistance with vehicles and logistics to aid enforcement.\nHe welcomed the suggestion to establish an Alternative Development Unit in the state, noting it could be placed under the governor’s office in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and relevant advisers.\nThe Governor highlighted existing initiatives, including the “Youth on Ridges” programme, where over 5,000 hectares were cleared for cocoa cultivation to promote agriculture and job creation and the state’s “tomato revolution,” which now accounts for about 40 percent of Lagos market tomatoes.\nHe stressed that community engagement with traditional rulers, churches and mosques would continue to encourage behavioural change among those involved in illicit cultivation, noting that education and enforcement are necessary to achieve lasting results.\nGovernor Aiyedatiwa expressed interest in the medicinal use of cannabis oil, urging the NDLEA to expedite ongoing studies and share the findings with the state.\nHe advocated controlled cultivation of cannabis for medicinal purposes, citing global practices and recent approvals in other countries, noting that cannabis oil is among the most expensive oils traded globally.\nIn attendance were the Deputy Governor, Dr Olayide Adelami; Secretary to the State Government, Dr Taiwo Fasoranti; Chief of Staff, Prince Segun Omojuwa; Commissioner for Health, Dr Banji Ajaka; Commissioner for Information, Mr Idowu Ajanaku; Commissioner for Culture and Tourism, Mr Adesoji Afolabi; Commissioner for Agriculture and Forestry, Mr Leye Akinola; Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Security, Mr Gbenga Atiba; and Special Adviser to the Governor on Special Duties and Strategy, Mr Gani Mohamed.\nPrince Ebenezer Adeniyan,\nChief Press Secretary to the Governor of Ondo State.\nJanuary 26, 2026.",
