  "text": "WHEN it comes to parenting keepsakes, there are more than a few options on the market. But there's a new product that's divided opinion, and left some people absolutely \"terrified\". The frame was shared on Instagram by the Joyful Kangaroo page, as they declared it's the \"cutest way to save your kid's baby teeth \". A picture of a child with their mouth wide open sits in the centre of the frame, with parents encouraged to put their children's baby teeth inside the mouth. \"A unique keepsake for their little milestones #babyteethbox #keepsake #firsttooth #momlife,\" they captioned a video of the product on Instagram . Unsurprisingly, the comments section on the Reel was immediately full of people weighing in, with the majority insisting they can't imagine having the product in their home. \"Fun fact: you don't * have * to save biological material from your kids,\" one sighed. \"What a horrible day to have eyes,\" another added. \"Imagine buying that at a thrift store and not knowing it's part zombie!\" a third gasped. \"Learn to let go, you are too attached to stuff even nature is trying to let go of,\" someone else urged. \"No, this is a no. I have a dental office and I have children. This is a no,\" another insisted. \"THIS. IS. F**KING. HORRIFYING,\" someone else yelled. Another agreed the frame is \"horrific\", as someone else said: \"I think we have very different definitions of 'cute'.\" \"Each to their own but for me keeping human body parts has a serial vibe,\" another laughed. While others insisted they were going to have \"nightmares\" after seeing the product. \"I feel like this is decor for the guest room no one can sleep in,\" one wrote. \"Do nightmares come free with this purchase or are they extra?\" another joked. \"Stuff of nightmares,\" a third agreed. Dr Khaled Kasem, Chief Orthodontist of Europe’s leading orthodontics chain Impress , tells Sun readers how to get their kids brushing their own teeth. 1. Find a time that's right for you \"Children need consistency to learn anything, so make sure you set a routine,\" Dr Kasem explained. \"Whether it’s immediately after breakfast or bath time or just before you tuck them into bed, make brushing a part of their normal schedule so they can get used to it.” 2. Keep it in the bathroom \"Try to make a habit of brushing in the bathroom, and make sure you’re doing the same,\" he said. \"Children often model adult behaviour and if they see you brushing your teeth elsewhere, the likelihood is they’ll want to do the same.” It's also a good idea to brush your teeth at the same time, as it could make your child want to do it too. 3. Take your time and let them learn Dr Eyrumlu said it's important to let kids explore holding the toothbrush on their own. \"Angling it correctly to reach every tooth is tough. You want to have the brush at a 45 degree angle to the teeth,\" he said. Splitting the mouth into four sections can help kids get it right. The upper half on the left, the upper half on the right, the lower half on the left, and the lower half on the right. 4. Add an element of fun “Try to make tooth brushing a fun activity rather than a chore, make them excited,\" said Dr Kasem. \"Whether it’s making up a song or naming each tooth something silly as you brush it, keeping them engaged will generate excitement around the whole thing.\" The Hey Dugee toothbrush song is a great example of this as it encourages kids to brush their teeth for a full two minutes - the recommended time. Another option is to use your child's favourite toy. \"Let them ‘brush’ the toy’s teeth (without toothpaste),\" Dr Kasem suggested. \"This will help them to understand that it’s a normal part of everyone’s routine, and not just a punishment for them. 5. Utilise time It's important to be brushing for a full two minutes, that's 30 seconds for each quarter of the mouth. Dr Eyrumlu suggests using a timer so kids can see or hear the time for themselves. “Encourage them to brush one quarter of the mouth, and when the timer is up they can move on to the next section,\" he explained. \"Brush along with them, doing your own teeth at the same time, enjoying the song. “You can also try using a mirror so your child can see what they’re doing.\" 6. Offer praise Don't forget to inspect your child's mouth when they're done to check they've done a good job. \"Then give lots of praise, high fives, whatever works,\" said Dr Eyrumlu. \"Bring the whole family into the experience if you can! It’s all about making the routine a fun experience they enjoy.” As someone else insisted: \"I deserve compensation for the nightmares this will cause!\" \"N not cute - nightmarish,\" another wrote. \"That is actually terrifying,\" someone else concluded. \"Please don’t do this. I promise you, no child wants to see this or inherit this later in their lives. \"There are so many wonderful and sweet mementos to save - this should not be one!\" ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF. \"The Sun\", \"Sun\", \"Sun Online\" are registered trademarks or trade names of News Group Newspapers Limited.
