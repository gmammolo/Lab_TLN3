  "text": "Kyler Murray apologizes after posing in Michael Vick jersey alongside pit bull\nPHOENIX (AZFamily) — A photoshoot has sparked controversy after Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray posed alongside his pit bull while wearing a Michael Vick jersey.\nIn the now-deleted photos, Murray is wearing Vick’s Virginia Tech college jersey while posing with his pit bull, Trunks. The photo sparked outrage on social media due to Vick’s conviction of dogfighting in 2007.\nMurray later removed the photos from his Instagram and limited his comments. The quarterback addressed the social media backlash and apologized during a press conference on Wednesday.\n“In no way shape or form do I condone animal cruelty or dogfighting. For me personally, you all saw me wear the Michael Vick jersey, a player that I admire very much growing up, and then being home with my pup,” Murray said.\n“My dog Trunks and Swoosh they both get treated like kings. So it’s not like, in no way shape or form, I condone that. I saw how it affected people and decided to take it down. I apologize to anyone that I affected by that,” the quarterback added.\nIn 2007, Vick, who was the quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons at the time, pleaded guilty to his involvement in the Bad Newz Kennels dogfighting ring at his Virginia home. Over 70 dogs, mostly pit bulls and some injured, were seized.\nRae Anderson, who works for the Crazy Pit Bull Lady Rescue in Phoenix, said Vick is well known as someone who has abused pit bulls, so Murray’s post comes off as extremely insensitive.\n“You’re posting that, and posting your pit bulls, so it’s almost like you support what he did,” said Anderson. “You can like him as a person and not support what Michael Vick did. I believe posting with a dog sends the wrong signal.”\nVick spent 21 months in federal prison for crimes and was suspended by the NFL. He was also forced to pay the Falcons back part of his signing bonus.\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?
