  "text": "Miami, FL – South Florida residents should brace for a wet stretch as thunderstorms build into Saturday, threatening travel and outdoor events. Drivers along I-95 and U.S. 1 could see ponding water and reduced visibility during peak afternoon storms.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Miami, scattered thunderstorms are expected each afternoon through Saturday. Heat index values could push to 101, making the mix of humidity and storms especially uncomfortable. Rain chances dip by Sunday night as a drier pattern arrives to start October.\nThursday and Friday afternoons bring a 40 percent storm chance, with gusty winds possible in heavier cells. By Saturday, coverage increases to 50 percent, raising the risk for localized street flooding in Miami Beach, Hialeah, and Kendall. East winds near 10 mph may also cause choppy waters for boaters.\nResidents should limit non-essential driving during storm hours, clear street drains, and keep devices charged in case of power outages. Outdoor events, including weekend festivals, could face delays or cancellations.\nConditions improve Sunday evening into Monday with lower rain chances. Sunshine returns by Tuesday, offering a preview of early October weather with highs in the upper 80s and less humidity.\nWarnings remain in effect through Saturday, and more advisories could be issued if storms intensify.\nFive-Day Forecast for Miami, FL\nThursday: High 88, storms likely after 2 p.m., heat index 101. Friday: High 89, scattered afternoon storms, breezy southeast winds. Saturday: High 88, 50% chance of storms, flooding risk in low areas. Sunday: High 88, storms taper by evening, drier air moves in. Monday: High 87, partly sunny, only a slight rain chance. Tuesday (Oct. 1): High 87, sunny, drier, humidity easing.",
