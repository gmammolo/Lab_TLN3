  "text": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle‘s marriage is reportedly in danger after his visit to the United Kingdom. The Duke of Sussex had a series of events to attend in his homeland, including the reunion with his father, King Charles. It appeared that he was being taken back to the life in the country that he had left behind. Now, a source has claimed that this might affect the prince’s marriage of seven years.\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle’s marriage wobbly after his UK visit, says source\nAs per Star‘s source, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s marriage is in trouble after the former’s U.K. visit. His recent trip to his home country suggests he is being pulled back to the life he and Markle left after resigning as working royals. A source told the outlet, “Harry’s been talking about spending more time in the U.K., possibly having a second home base there.” Additionally, he is considering “returning for good.”\nThis has reportedly left the Duchess of Sussex “shocked.” She is surprised her husband “would even consider moving back to Britain.” This is especially after “everything they’ve been through and how much work they’ve done to rebuild their lives in America.” The source stated the couple seemingly “want different things.” However, this isn’t a good sign for their marriage. Additionally, the source stated that the 41-year-old duke “can be quite stubborn.”\nOn the other hand, Markle “isn’t one to back down either.” The source continued, “If this disagreement can’t be resolved, people around them fear it could lead to some explosive fights and maybe even divorce.” Nevertheless, Harry still has a long way to go to make amends with his family. While this year, he had talked about focusing on his father, this is what the duchess “feared would happen.”\nShe doesn’t wish to return to England, and the source said she is “upset.” Markle doesn’t want her husband to take their kids to the U.K. “where they aren’t safe.” The couple “have a sheltered life, good schools, friends, protection” in the U.S. The source concluded, “Meghan has already put her foot down to going back to a family that treated her so abominably.”",
