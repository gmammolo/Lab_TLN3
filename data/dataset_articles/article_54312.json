  "text": "Modern supercars have been grabbing all the headlines right now. They're at the peak of automotive technology, and they just keep getting more and more impressive every year. But, are they actually as awesome as we're supposed to think they are? While they may be technological tour-de-forces, they often end up missing some of the most fun parts of driving. It's not surprising, then, that many people would prefer to own rawer and more analogue classic cars over them – especially if they were built for nothing but sheer V8 thrills.\nBorn from an era where safety, efficiency and making cars as easy to drive as possible weren't the main concern, muscle cars still hold up against modern sports cars. How do they make modern supercars pale in comparison? It's for a number of different reasons. While some of those reasons can be subjective, when you think about them, it's not that difficult to argue that modern supercars just aren't as exciting as classic muscle cars.\nModern Supercars Often Have Too Many Driver Aids\nAs cars have developed, more technology has been introduced to them. This includes driver aids. Many enthusiasts argue that the technology that's been used to make supercars more manageable to drive has actually sapped the fun out of them. More modern flagship supercars, such as the Lamborghini Huracan, the R35 Nissan GT-R and the second-generation Acura NSX, have been cited as being fast but far too boring to drive.\nThat's a problem classic muscle cars don't have. The most driver aids you'll see in a classic muscle car are things like power steering or an automatic transmission. You'll never see anything like traction control, stability control or even anti-lock brakes. Yes, that makes them more difficult to handle than modern machinery. But, if you can handle them, the reward is the kind of driving experience you just don't get in any modern car at all, let alone any modern supercar. You feel so much more involved with the car, and the car actively rewards you for being able to handle it like a true driver.\nWhile many classic muscle cars can be downright dangerous to drive (something that's still true with muscle cars today, if statistics are anything to go by), their lack of driver aids and modern safety systems makes them feel more fun and involving. Many enthusiasts are willing to make the trade-off between something that's safer and something that's more fun, and it's totally understandable.\nSome Still Have An Analogue Feel\nThe prevalence of driver aids in modern supercars doesn't mean that they all have them, though. There are quite a few modern supercars out there that prioritise a more analogue feel. The Ultima RS has modern supercar power and performance, but it's extremely light and has no real driver aids at all. The upcoming Nilu27 is also designed to be as analogue as possible, focusing on a raw driving experience. The demand for a raw driving experience is clearly still there. For as long as that exists, people will still make cars that cater for it.\nSupercar Designs Leave Little To The Imagination\nAdmittedly, not all classic muscle cars are the best-looking, but many of them are definitely more attractive than today's crop of supercars. The original 1960s Ford Mustang is arguably a design classic, and the stylings of bigger muscle cars like the Chevrolet Chevelle SS and Ford Galaxie 500 have aged really well with time. If you turn up to a car meet in one of these classic muscle cars, people will always admire them. It doesn't matter if they're older enthusiasts who remember when they were fairly new, or young kids who are experiencing car culture for the first time.\nClassic Muscle Cars Have Timless Looks\nA muscle car usually resembles a more muscular version of an everyday car that blends perfectly on the road. On the other hand, modern supercars tend to take their designs and aerodynamics to the extreme. As such, no one's surprised when they do a 3-second 0-60 mph launch or sound like a rocket taking off. Admittedly, that takes a lot away from the fun. Meanwhile, classic muscle cars simply look cool and still manage to surprise with their performance.\nNot All Modern Supercars Are Ugly\nIt might be easy to write off modern supercars as exclusively being ugly. Many people have done. But, there are some that definitely aren't! The Ferrari 296 GTB is a current offering that nobody can argue looks bad, and the same can be said about the Maserati MC20. It's hard to argue that the Ferrari LaFerrari is a bad looker, either, and Pagani's latest offering the Utopia is utterly stunning. Beauty may truly be in the eye of the beholder a lot of the time. But, some of the current crop of supercars are proving that the ability to create something that most people will agree is gorgeous isn't going away.\nSupercars No Longer Sound As Good As Classic V8 Muscle Cars\nOne of the things that supercars used to be known for was their sound. In the days of more analogue supercars, it was obligatory to have a screaming V8, V10 or V12. These days, thanks to tighter emissions regulations and the onset of electrification, engines tend to be smaller and much less impressive. It might mean that modern supercars are more efficient than ever, but their sound suffers as a result. Perhaps one of the biggest offenders for sounding underwhelming is the Ferrari F80. While its predecessors had V8s and V12s that sounded incredible, the F80 only has a twin-turbocharged V6 that sounds disappointingly muted. Compared to the guttural V8 of a classic muscle car like the Plymouth Road Runner, modern supercars just can't compare.\nThis also assumes that a modern supercar might even have an engine at all. Quite a few of them have ditched internal combustion engines entirely, opting to embrace fully-electric powertrains. The Rimac Nevera has grabbed headlines all over the place for its incredible electric performance, Bbt, because it's fully electric, it barely makes any noise. That's not going to make many traditional car enthusiasts happy, especially those who love the kind of sounds that old-school muscle cars make. You only have to look at the backlash to the fully-electric Dodge Charger Daytona (a car so soundly rejected that Dodge doesn't make the entry-level version of it any more due to low customer demand) to realise that.\nOn the other hand, classic V8 muscle cars still sound incredible, even in factory spec. That's because their big-displacement, naturally aspirated V8s create a raw, unfiltered roar that modern turbocharged or hybridized engines can’t replicate. With deep exhaust notes and lumpy camshaft idles, they deliver a visceral soundtrack that feels more alive than virtually any supercar released in the last five years!\nNot Every Modern Supercar Sounds Bad\nWhile many modern supercars just don't sound as great as classic muscle cars, that doesn't mean that of them sound underwhelming. Not every modern supercar around has swapped the roaring and screaming engines of old in the name of efficiency or electrification. The Aston Martin Valkyrie has helped keep the old-school naturally aspirated V12 alive, gaining notoriety for being loud and proud (especially while it's been racing in the World Endurance Championship).\nThe GMA T.50 and T.50S Niki Lauda also decided to try to keep the V12 going, as has the Lamborghini Revuelto (with the aid of plug-in hybrid technology). The trend may be going towards smaller, more efficient engine. But, it looks like we're going to have the loud old-school engines around for a while yet. If the Lamborghini Revuelto has taught us anything, electrification might actually help to save them from going into extinction.\nMuscle Cars Are Easier To Enjoy On The Road\nPerhaps one of the biggest criticisms people have had recently of modern supercars is that they're often far too fast and powerful to properly enjoy on the road. While their performance is genuinely incredible, you won't experience anywhere near it on a public road. That's if you're being a responsible driver, anyway! It's easy to marvel at 1,000+hp monsters such as the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1X, the Rimac Nevera, the Koenigsegg Jesko, the SSC Tuatara and the Hennessey Venom F5. But, trying to do anything fun with that kind of speed means you have to take them to a track or a big, long runway.\nThat's not an issue you ever have to worry about with a classic muscle car. You can absolutely enjoy yourself on the public road driving an old Ford Mustang, a classic Dodge Charger or a Chevrolet Chevelle SS. These cars are all powerful enough to be fun, but not so powerful that you can't get anywhere near their limits without taking them to a track first. In that way, they're more like traditional small sports cars. You can get a lot of fun out of a Mazda Miata or a Toyota GR86 while staying on the public road and being a responsible driver. While the kind of driving fun you'll experience in a classic muscle car is quite different to what you'll experience in a smaller, traditional sports car, it's still fun that you don't need to break the law to have.",
