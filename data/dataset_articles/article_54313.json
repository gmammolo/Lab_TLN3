  "text": "Philadelphia, Pa. – Rain-soaked commutes and potential thunder Saturday could disrupt travel across southeastern Pennsylvania, including stretches of I-95 and I-76. Motorists should brace for slick conditions and heavier downpours during the afternoon and evening.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, showers and thunderstorms will develop Saturday, with a 40% chance of rain lasting into the night. Stronger cells may bring brief, heavy rainfall. Drivers are urged to slow down on highways, avoid flooded underpasses, and allow extra travel time.\nFriday looks calmer, with sunshine returning and a high near 81. Winds will remain light, helping to dry roads ahead of the weekend. But by Saturday afternoon, clouds build again, and showers return across Philadelphia, Camden, and Bucks County.\nSunday offers a break with mostly dry skies, though a few scattered showers may linger into the afternoon. Temperatures dip slightly into the upper 70s, signaling a seasonal shift. Looking ahead, Monday and Tuesday bring more scattered showers, while Wednesday — the first day of October — looks mostly sunny with highs near 70. Cooler air will feel more like early fall, hinting at the region’s gradual slide toward winter weather.\nResidents should prepare for changing conditions by keeping devices charged, monitoring alerts, and avoiding unnecessary travel during storms.\nWarnings remain possible into Saturday night, but improving weather Sunday sets up a calmer start to October.\nFive-Day Forecast for Philadelphia, Pa.\n- Friday: Mostly sunny, high 81, low 64.\n- Saturday: Showers and thunderstorms, high 78, low 65.\n- Sunday: Scattered showers, high 76, low 66.\n- Monday: Chance of showers, high 78, low 64.\n- Tuesday: Showers possible, high 73, low 63.\n- Wednesday (Oct. 1): Mostly sunny, high 70, low 57.",
