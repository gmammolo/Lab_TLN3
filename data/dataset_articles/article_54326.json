  "text": "There once was a time when Tom Brady was just a kid with a backward hat, a box of pizza, and the will to be the best he could be. That was the Brady that New England fell in love with 25 years ago as he began bringing the region joy and many memories.\nBut that was before two decades of superstardom warped his sensibilities. The Tom Brady of today no longer resembles the humble 199th pick, nor does he live in the real world like you and me.\nThose points were driven home Wednesday when Brady published his weekly newsletter, “199.″ In it, he addressed, in his usual roundabout way, the conflict of interest he is engulfed in as a minority owner of the Raiders and a lead game analyst for Fox.\nAdvertisement\nThis was not Brady at his finest. He deflected, made excuses, lacked self-awareness, and brushed off his critics as merely “the paranoid and distrustful.” It sounded a lot like a guy whose red hat Brady once kept in his locker.\n“Because when you’re blinded by distrust, it’s hard to see anything other than self-interest,” Brady wrote.\nI suppose I’m one of those paranoid folks, because the conflict of interest here is pretty obvious . Brady wants the Raiders to succeed, he gets special access to players and coaches from 31 other teams thanks to Fox, and he shares that information with the Raiders. Antonio Pierce, last year’s Raiders head coach, said as much in an interview last week . Pete Carroll, this year’s coach, said he talks to Brady 2-3 times per week. The NFL even crafted special rules for Brady, restricting his access for Fox because of the relationship.\nAdvertisement\nThe conflict isn’t hypothetical — Brady called Cowboys-Bears last Sunday, and the Bears face his Raiders this Sunday.\nBrady downplays his role with the Raiders as that of a “minority owner,” but he’s being disingenuous. Brady is the big boss. The Raiders’ new general manager was Brady’s college teammate and worked with him in Tampa. Brady had a large say in hiring the coach and choosing the quarterback. Alex Guererro, Brady’s longtime trainer, works for the Raiders in an official capacity.\n“I have a deep desire to help refresh and reinvigorate the culture of a franchise with cherished traditions and a long, storied history in professional football,” Brady wrote of the Raiders.\nConflict of interest? It’s not even up for debate.\nIt’s another example of Brady’s complicated relationship with following the rules and pushing the boundaries of acceptable behavior. No other broadcaster has a direct, financial relationship with a team.\nYet in Brady’s world, the mere suggestion of this is ludicrous.\n“We are living through a period of great paranoia and distrust,” he wrote. “I don’t know what it is about judgmental people, but their judgments never seem to be positive or optimistic.”\nRelated : Shaughnessy: Bill Parcells, now a Patriots Hall of Famer, looks back None of Brady’s critics are being judgmental. They (we) just think his arrangement doesn’t pass the smell test, and the NFL should force him to pick a lane — owner or broadcaster.\nThe NFL allows Brady’s dual life, which is all that matters, though the league has never fully explained why.\nAdvertisement\nBut Brady doesn’t live on Planet Sensible anymore, which is probably why he’s having a difficult time connecting with the Fox TV audience each Sunday. He’s on Planet Superstar, where everyone caters to your whim and your greatness is never questioned.\nBrady is pretty naive if he didn’t expect any brushback. Perhaps he genuinely thinks nothing wrong of his setup; conflicts of interest are de rigueur in Washington these days.\nBrady clearly needs more people in his life to tell him no. He shouldn’t have written this newsletter in the first place — his comments serve only to resuscitate a topic that was fading away. And Brady needs someone to let him know when he’s lacking self-awareness.\nRelated : Tom Brady isn’t a rescuing hero in this soccer documentary Brady writes, presumably with a straight face, about how seriously he takes his commitment to Fox viewers. The theme of his piece is “duty and integrity. Doing your job the right way.”\n“I want everyone who tunes into Fox on Sunday afternoons to feel like they got their money’s worth for the three hours they entrust to our entire team,” he wrote. “Those are precious hours for busy, hard-working people. We owe them a return on that investment, which is to do our jobs to the best of our abilities.”\nNowhere does Brady acknowledge that his dual role actually detracts from his Fox job, since his access to team facilities is restricted and players and coaches have acknowledged they are extra careful about what they say around him. Brady is less informed as a broadcaster than he would be if he weren’t also running the Raiders.\nBrady also is aghast that anyone would dare suggest he uses his Fox platform for personal gain with the Raiders.\nAdvertisement",
