  "text": "Raul Malo is nothing less than brave.\nThe Mavericks frontman has shared his battle against stage 4 cancer since last July, and the latest update is not good news. The 60-year-old singer took to Facebook Wednesday to let fans know that he has gotten a new, grim diagnosis.\nHis announcement was met with an outpouring of love and prayer. And he made it while also making clear that he is not afraid and is full-speed ahead in trying to battle it.\n“Dear Friends, I want to update you all on my health, as things have taken a turn,” he wrote on Facebook. “As it goes with cancer, it’s a very unpredictable and indiscriminatory disease. I’ve developed something called LMD, which stands for ‘get this (expletive) out of my head.’ Treatment for this is radiation, which I will start tomorrow. We will probably jump into some chemo and are even looking at alternative therapies. But it’s time to take to heart your words of resting & recovering, so that’s what I’m going to do.\n“Unfortunately, this does mean all shows going forward are cancelled, but we’ll continue doing cool projects, releasing live recordings, merchandise, Trovador and so forth,” he continued. “I want to thank Dwight Yoakam, his band, and crew for their kindness and understanding this year, and sorry we couldn’t finish the tour the way we planned. Hang on to your tickets for the Ryman in December, as we are planning something special there, and hope to announce that very soon.”\nMalo then reassured fans about how he is doing.\n“But I want to let everybody know, I am in no way alone, or scared,” he said. “I have an amazing wife and boys, wonderful family, team, road crew, band, friends and fans. I don’t even have enough words to describe the love and support that I’m getting right now. To my friends who have sent me texts and messages, I want you to know that I’ve read them all.I can’t return them all, but your love, prayers, and well wishes have not gone unnoticed.\n“We don’t know what this will look like a couple months from now, but we are going into it like we have with everything else,” Malo continued. “Full steam ahead. Fight, recover, rest, repeat. I want to thank you all for your incredible support through all this, & sorry about the cancellations but we not choice anymore. Find kindness and empathy out there wherever you can. Humans are alright, even if you don’t believe it from what you see on TV. We will keep you informed as this goes, and I promise, no more bullfighting pictures without context.”\nIt came after Malo shared a photo of a bullfighter bowing before a bull on Tuesday.\nLeptomeningeal Disease is when cancer spread to the cerebrospinal fluid and leptomeninges, which are membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. According to the Cleveland Clinic , there is no cure for the disease, and treatment focuses on keeping the disease from spreading while easing symptoms to maintain quality of life.\nThe site said that people who receive treatment for the disease typically live between three to six months after diagnosis.\n“I’m keeping you in my prayers,” Jeff Swain responded to Malo’s post. “And I want you to know how much your beautiful music has helped me in having a more musical life. Aside from the truly incredible artistry, just on a technical level, you are and have been one of the most powerful, beautiful and talented voices of a generation. There are too many examples of your excellence to pinpoint any type of apex. But your solo rendition of Fool #1 on the Sessions on West 54th show was burned into my heart. Thank you for sharing it with us all.”\n“Raul, your strength, courage and grace is an inspiration to so many,” Linda Zaldivar wrote. “WE have followed the Mavericks since the late 80s, my brothers and sisters love your music too. My kids 30s/40s have gone to concerts with us here in San Diego too. We’ve traveled to Austin and Nashville to see you. You are amazing, every performance is so memorable, power and charisma on stage. Am a recent cancer survivor and know how hard this can be. Prayers and positive vibes to you.”\n“I guess I’m not the only one in tears today,” Shirley Carmen Rivera wrote. “I will continue to pray for you and your family. The positive impact you have had on my life since the early 90s and even more since 2010 has been unmeasurable. May God surround you with love, strength and healing.”\nMalo had a surgery in August that he hoped would be the start to his road back to full health. But earlier this month, The Mavericks announced on Instagram that he was taking more time off on the direction of his doctors.\n“Due to the circumstances of his current medical condition, Raul’s medical team has instructed him not to be on the road this weekend,” the post read back on Sept. 11. “As a result we’ve had to make the difficult decision to cancel this weekend’s performances in New Haven, Verona & Boston. While Raul continues the long road to recovery, we hope you’ll still enjoy an incredible night of music with our great friends Dwight Yoakam and opener Phillip Bowen!\n“We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and deeply appreciate your continued support during this time.”\nMalo revealed in late July that he had the surgery planned for early August. And in late June, he also gave fans an idea of what was ahead for him in his fight against the disease.\n“Thank you to everyone for their kind wishes and support throughout all of this,” Malo wrote on Instagram. “It has not gone unnoticed I assure you. As we go through this, and I saw ‘we’ because I am not going through this alone. My family at home, my crew, my band, my management … my whole entire crew is going through this with me. Without their support who knows where I’d be. It’s important to surround yourself with as much love and support as possible. Psychology is an integral part of your physical state. I thought I had everything under control. (BTW, that’s just you lying to yourself) Then the cancer sideshows started to play out.\n“My sinus infection literally brought me to my knees,” he added. “I had never felt headaches like that. I went to a specialist. Got it taken care of but the residual results are numbing of the left side of my face. Neurologist said it will repair over time. The damage is not permanent and not visible. A little drooling here and there ... oh well.”\n“Perspective: I’m alive.”\nMalo continued to lay out his physical situation.\n“The abdominal hernia has been the most challenging in all of this,” he wrote. “First of all it’s very visible. And at times it has been really painful. Most of the time it’s just really uncomfortable as I have to wear this hernia belt around my abdomen to help keep my insides in place … ugh! I’ve basically been turned into a drooling, farting potato … sigh.\n“Perspective: I’m alive.”\nHe then talked about the road ahead.\n“I say all this because I want those that are going through this to know that challenges will arise,” he wrote. “You will have your own. The fact that I can go onstage helps keep me focused on the end game. My colon surgery has been scheduled for August. The hernia will be repaired later on in the year as that will require a bit more recovery time. 16 rounds of chemo have done what they’re made to do … kill cancer. I’m not out of the woods yet but I’m on the way. First pic is from my last round of chemo. Then per usual I go for a drive in the countryside while listening to Pavarotti while driving a little over the speed limit. My wife Betty, makes a delicious Spanish omelet (my favorite) as the Mediterranean diet helps keep you healthy. For all those fighting this fight … hang in there. We got this! RM”\nMalo spent time in the hospital in January after developing the hernia. He also announced in January that he had surgery on Dec. 10 to remove a tumor from his liver.\nMalo announced his diagnosis last June in an Instagram video.\n“In the last couple of years, we out here on the road, we have been on a health kick,” he said. “Treating ourselves a little better. Taking care out ourselves a little better, and really trying to do all the right things as far as nutrition, etc. So, part of the health journey is to get yourself checked out. Go to a doctor, take a physical and start there.”\nMalo said that is what he did.\n“And that led to another appointment with a gastrointestinal specialist, which led to a CAT scan,” he said. “And that proved to show two cancerous spots.”\nTrending Editor and Retail, Restaurant, Real Estate Editor If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
