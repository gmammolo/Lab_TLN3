  "text": "MANASQUAN — The Salty Whale hosted its last hurrah over the weekend with its doors closing for a final time at 7 p.m. on Sunday Sept. 21, and according to George Steiner, the guesthouse and restaurant broke record numbers on Saturday night, rivaling crowds seen only for the Thanksgiving Turkey Trot.\nAlthough Sunday was technically the closing day, Saturday night was definitely the farewell celebration for this community hub, which has been in operation since 2018, and holds a long history before then.\n“Saturday was the busiest night we’ve had, and (I want) to thank everyone who came out to support us,” Steiner said. “The building became too much…the cost became too much to run it, and we had to make a decision.” Steiner is a managing member of Driftwood Hospitality Group LLC, the operator of The Salty Whale. Additional partners are Greg Cavallo, Tim Gross and Sal Adragna.\n“My staff this summer was absolutely, absolutely amazing…I was very fortunate,” Steiner said. “They rocked it Saturday, they were the reason everybody in the community was able to have such a wonderful time.”\nOn Oct. 1, an auction will be held for kitchen supplies, bar and other restaurant equipment. Interested bidders can submit online bids at bestbuyauctioneers.com starting now.\nHISTORY OF BUILDING\nThe Salty Whale building was constructed in the 1890s and later operated as The Jackson House, according to documents provided to The Coast Star by the Squan Village Historical Society. In the century-plus since, the building has housed a number of restaurants who in one form or another have served residents and visitors of Manasquan.\nAccording to an article in the July 5, 1940 edition of The Coast Star, The Jackson House was “the ideal place to stay in Manasquan for the summer,” and featured home cooking, full-course dinners for 75 cents and special Sunday dinners for 85 cents.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the location housed Doc Donahue’s South and The Main Street Saloon before resident Jim O’Neill opened O’Neill’s Bar, Grill and Guesthouse in the mid 1990s and operated until September 2012, just before Superstorm Sandy.\nThe building survived the storm that destroyed houses and business along the Jersey Shore in October 2012, and later opened for business as the Manasquan Beach House before the local group of owners purchased the property and opened The Salty Whale in June 2018.\nFUTURE PLANS FOR THE SITE\nThe Salty Whale building is to be demolished by the end of the year and the property divided into five single-family residential home lots. The homes will not qualify as affordable housing, according to Mayor Michael Mangan.\nThe property lies in a single-family residential zone. The proposed plan for the site of the building once it is demolished, is to plot out four 7,137-square-foot lots and a fifth lot on the corner of East Main Street and North Potter Avenue measured at 8,070 square feet.\nAs previously reported by The Coast Star Neil Ducharme of Ralco Builders, the contract purchaser of 390 E. Main Street LLC, is the developer responsible for constructing all five houses. Ducharme is the contract purchaser of the 390 E. Main St. property, and estimated that each of the lots will be listed for over $3 million.\nDucharme said in a previous statement to The Coast Star, “We will be building five gorgeous single-family homes for new families to be able to enjoy the experience of living in Manasquan as much as the longtime residents. My family lives here, I work in Manasquan and take pride in the homes we have built for families to grow in our special town.”\nThis is an excerpt of the print article.
