  "text": "Jennifer Aniston Stunning In Mexico String Bikini Shamed For 'Thicker Middle'\nBy Evie Scott on September 25, 2025 at 5:00 AM EDT\nJennifer Aniston made instant headlines for her swimsuit action as she hit up Cabos, Mexico, for a sun-soaked break this year. In January 2025, the sitcom star jetted out of South of the Border, where she was spotted flaunting her killer body in a string bikini. Proving she's barely aged since her 1994-2004 era on Friends, Jen highlighted her curves and incredible muscles in a stringy swimsuit, making headlines for showcasing her figure, plus for hanging out with friend Jason Bateman. While many fans celebrated Jen sizzling in her pink-and-blue bikini, some chose to shame the actress, with a popular reply criticizing her for having gotten \"thicker\" around the \"middle.\"\nJennifer Aniston Stuns In Bikini During Mexico Vacation\n[https://t.co/amouwOUn2l][pic.twitter.com/MXcYGPDWK9]— Who is Chic (@WhoischicX)\n[March 22, 2023]\nScroll for the photos. Relaxing poolside while rocking a mismatched bikini, Jen flaunted her super-toned abs and killer legs while tastefully highlighting her curves.\nThe Morning Show star, who recently made a string of public appearances in NYC to promote the latest season of her show, looked relaxed in the relatively grainy images, with one showing her holding a large towel.\nSee More Photos Below!\nBikini-clad Jennifer Aniston lounges poolside with pal Jason Bateman on Cabo vacation\n[https://t.co/7NJHpYtaZT][pic.twitter.com/4gnf7SfAs9]— Page Six (@PageSix)\n[January 3, 2025]\nShowing off her highlighted locks and a golden tan, Jen also leaned forward in one photo as she completed her look with a stylish pair of shades. The Daily Mail quickly published the photos, which made headlines as Jen was reported to have worn the same bathing suit 13 years earlier.\nOver 1,500 users agreed when a user commenting on Jen's shape wrote: \"Her body looks the same except for the thicker middle, while although flat, reflects a natural change for any woman passing the menopause. Waists widen regardless of overall fitness.\" Thinking that Jen's privacy had been invaded, another user gained likes for writing: \"Another intrusion by the Paparazzi with a long lens, hence the grainy photos.\"\nJaw-Dropping Figure In Plunging Black Dress\nView this post on Instagram\nJennifer Aniston received zero complaints in this Instagram photo, posted earlier this year.\nPromoting her LolaVie haircare brand, the ex to Brad Pitt slipped her curves into this fishtail, ruched dress, showing off her super-fit figure as she continues to turn heads with her body. Jen's status as a fitness icon has risen, and she now fronts workout brand Pvolve. Talk is as much about Jen's face as her body, though, with her recent no-surgery reveal seeing some fans disagree. Jen says she's done \"facials and the lasers and all that good stuff,\" she confirmed. Since then, Jens' facialist has spoken out to talk more about the actress's routine.\nThe Secret Behind This Face\nView this post on Instagram\nSpeaking to The Daily Mail, Jennifer Aniston's facialist Joanna Czech confirmed: \"They change their lifestyle, step up workouts, get slimming massages, and follow a precise facial routine. It's not instant, it takes time,\" here referencing stars in general. Likely referencing Botox, she added: \"Everything is connected, so if the largest muscles are frozen, then things are getting a little weaker.\"",
