  "text": "Alleged staff poaching sparks backlash from heartland bubble tea shop against Chagee\nEthel TsengTNP\nSept 24, 2025\nA TikTok video that purports to show a representative of a major Chinese tea beverage chain attempting to poach an employee from a heartland bubble tea store has created a stir online.\nThe 19-second clip shows CCTV footage of a customer waiting for his drink at the Ang Mo Kio branch of No.17 Tea, which has five outlets, while the barista packs his order.\nOnce the order is ready, the customer passes his name card to the staff member. The subtitle claims he is \"asking them to join their company, promising better pay\".\nThe staff member accepts the name card and sets it aside while processing his payment.\nIn the caption, No.17 Tea urges support for small businesses and ethical hiring practices.\nThe clip had garnered over 35,800 views and 256 likes at press time.\nTea company says poaching is 'unethical'\nIn response to queries from The New Paper, director of No.17 Tea Constance Tan, said that the customer in the clip handed over a name card from Chagee, which has at least six outlets in Singapore, and promised the barista more benefits.\nThe supposed Chagee representative also tried to persuade the staff member to contact the company. Ms Tan said there had been a similar incident in the past, though she does not know which company was involved.\nCalling poaching practices \"completely unethical\", Ms Tan pointed to high rentals and inflation as ongoing challenges that small businesses have to grapple with.\n\"I'm certain Chagee is not trying to advocate for poaching, given their good reputation, so I hope they can be accountable and responsible for this,\" she said.\nTNP has reached out to Chagee for comment.\nChallenges in hiring experienced workers, similar poaching incidents reported\nF&B consultant Khoo Keat Hwee said he has heard of cases of poaching, describing such practices as a \"shortcut\" to hire experienced staff members.\n\"Smaller players suffer the most, because they simply can't match the salaries or career progression that bigger companies can offer,\" he explained.\nHe highlighted the difficulties in hiring and retaining skilled staff members, citing the significant amounts spent on recruitment advertisements and training for new hires, offering competitive salaries, and the high levies and compliance costs that come with hiring foreign workers.\nSean Choong, founder of Amps Tea, agreed that attracting experienced workers is a consistent challenge. He also reported a similar incident where representatives from Chagee approached his staff members to hand them business cards.\n\"We want to compete on product quality, service, and innovation - not on who can dangle the biggest cheque in front of an employee,\" he told TNP.\nMost netizens think there's 'nothing wrong'\nIn the comments on the TikTok clip, while some called it \"not professional\", many argued that workers should be free to pursue better opportunities.\n\"Nothing wrong in offering a good worker a good job,\" one netizen stated.\nAnother user echoed the sentiment: \"You are not being fair to your employees. It's a free market and employees are entitled for the opportunity for better pay if someone is willing to pay them for it.\"\n\"How dare he offer them more pay… What's next? Better benefits? More days off?\" one user remarked ironically.",
