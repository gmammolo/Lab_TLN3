  "text": "Woman Rants About R846 Checkers Toiletries Haul: “Let Me Show You What I Bought”\n- A woman named Mrs Gonsalves was visibly stunned when she saw the amount her toiletries from Checkers cost her\n- Some of the items she bought included sanitary towels, body spray, face cream and serum, and detergent pods\n- Several internet users advised the woman to buy her toiletries elsewhere, while others assumed what drove up the total cost\nAn Afrikaner woman was in disbelief when she saw that her toiletries, which she bought from Checkers, cost her R846, showing the realities many South Africans experience regarding the cost of living. Some online community members shared that they knew what was in her shopping bag that made that whopping total.\nThe shopper, who goes by the name Mrs Gonsalves on her TikTok account, took to the app on 24 September, 2025. She noted that she wasn't making a haul video but expressed her shock at the cost of all the items she purchased, even though she used her Checkers Xtra Savings Rewards card.\nSpeaking to the online audience, the woman said:\n\"Let me show you what I bought.\"\nDON'T MISS IT: Stay Away From Fake News With Our Short, Free Fact-Checking Course.

Mrs Gonsalves revealed that she saved R109 when she used the rewards card.\nPricey toiletries haul gets South Africans talking\nWhile some South Africans felt they knew the reason behind the expensive toiletries, others took to the comment section to advise the woman where she should have bought the items to avoid spending all those rands.\n@lilly_leigh_sa told the upset shopper:\n\"Try to buy those toiletries from Clicks or Dis-Chem. Most of the time, they have specials.\"\n@gunthe.r wrote in the comments about the receipt:\n\"When I saw the shampoo, conditioner, and dishwashing pods, I understood why it was R900.\"\n@arnovanwyk596 provided their opinion with a laugh:\n\"It's the price you have to pay as a woman. Toiletries for men probably cost R200, for the most part, and last for the entire month.\"\nA humorous @blackbird_4 confessed in the comments:\n\"At this point, I'm using a bar of Sunlight soap as a dishwasher, shampoo, as well as for the body.\"\nAfter watching the video, @rukaiya0828, equally stunned, wrote:\n\"Still, it's ridiculous, and I can see she wasn't being extravagant. She was mindful. Nothing prepared you for the shock. I'm just saying.\"\n@ladyjanebeal shared under the post:\n\"Just for reference purposes, I don't do the grocery shopping. My husband does all that. The last time I shopped, peanut butter was R6.99. I have no idea what things cost these days. I'm too afraid to!\"\nTake a look at the TikTok video below:\n3 Other stories about shopping hauls\n- In other news, Briefly News reported that a young woman\nshowcased her R2 600 toiletries haul, noting that she bought the items from different stores, including a shop she dubbed a MimiQ dupe. - A Cape Town shopper\nshowcased her massive Clicks haul.
