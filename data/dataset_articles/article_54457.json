  "text": "Marten de Roon left Middlesbrough in summer 2017 after a just a year with Boro.\nThe Dutchman joined the Riverside club from Atalanta in 2016 and returned to the Italian side. He’s now become a cult hero for them at the age of 34. De Roon has played 400 games for the Bergamo club and has seen them rise to being a prominent name in Europe.\nThe midfielder has spoken to L’Eco di Bergamo and mentioned his time at Middlesbrough. He explained that whilst he has no regrets about the move, he didn’t particularly enjoy the England experience.\nRelayed by TuttoAtalanta, he said: “It was a dream to play in the Premier League, and I wanted to test myself there. I have no regrets, but I didn’t enjoy it. The quality of life, the food, the climate. After Italy, it’s difficult. And I had grown too accustomed to Bergamo.”\nThe veteran said even he struggled at first in Bergamo, he developed a strong connection with the city and Atalanta after his return from Middlesbrough.\n“I remember struggling with the language and struggling at first. Then, after my experience in England, I returned and a special relationship was born here, which I feel every day. Two of my three daughters were born here, and Bergamo is our home today.”\nDe Roon can see himself becoming a coach at La Dea in the future.\n“I’d like to stay in Bergamo. Coaching could be an option, but I don’t know if it’s the right path for me. With Gasperini, I realised how all-consuming it is: you never stop. Maybe starting with the boys might be a better fit. In the meantime, I’ll play for a few more years and then I’ll decide.”\nWhile he was a regular in the 2016/17 Premier League season for Middlesbrough, with 33 games, his impact has been more prominent at Atalanta.",
