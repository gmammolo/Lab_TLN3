  "text": "The price of Disney+ is going up again after another UK price hike.\nSpotted by Cordbusters, the timing couldn’t be worse, as streaming increasingly feels less like a bargain and more like the old cable bills people tried to leave behind.\nThe only figure Disney has confirmed so far is the annual Standard plan, rising from £89.90 to £99.99 on September 30, 2025. That’s an 11% bump, and if past behaviour is any guide, the rest of the tiers are likely to follow.\nOn paper, Premium annual could climb close to £150, which is a huge jump from the £59.99 launch price back in 2020.\nDisney isn’t alone here. Netflix has been raising prices regularly, Apple TV+ moved from £6.99 to £8.99 a month earlier this September, and Amazon Prime Video now charges extra for ad-free viewing.\nStreaming services are treating yearly increases as standard, and subscribers are left paying combined bills that look uncomfortably similar to traditional Sky or Virgin packages.\nA service no longer cheap\nWhen Disney+ launched in the UK in 2020, it felt like a steal at £5.99 a month with 4K and four streams included. To get that same package today, you need the Premium tier at £12.99. If predictions prove right and Premium rises to £14.99, that would mark a 150% increase in just five years.\nFor context, our Netflix review and Apple TV+ review highlight how this trend has become industry-wide rather than unique to Disney.\nDisney+ continues to expand with sports rights and Hulu integration, but the latest hike risks alienating loyal subscribers. For many cord-cutters, streaming now feels less like freedom and more like the TV bundles they thought they’d left behind.\nOpinion\nThe Disney+ price increases shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone. Not because this isn’t the first time that they’ve increased prices, but because this is the endgame for all video streaming services.\nWith TV especially moving from terrestrial broadcasts via aerials to being delivered over Wi-Fi (such as Freely and Sky Stream), the industry has shifted from the likes of cable to the Internet.\nThe change has meant the audience has began to shift too, so while cable audiences are dropping, streaming users are growing.\nTraditional means of broadcast are dropping in revenue, so streaming has to make up the shortfall. So while this is yet another small increase, in the opinion of huge media companies such as Disney and Warner Bros., you’re not paying enough – or at least you’re paying what you would have done if you were using cable.\nSo expect prices to continue going up, as well as the bundling of streaming services into various packages",
