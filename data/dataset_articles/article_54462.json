  "text": "By Ansley Franco ,\n39 minutes ago Steve Van Troxell said he couldn’t sleep in the early hours of Sept. 14 because of the noise coming from a party at the short-term vacation rental (STVR) operating next door on Whitefield Avenue.\n“I was up because I just heard them out there, and I kind of felt like something was going to happen,” Van Troxell said.\nHe then heard gunshots, about 30 to his estimation based on his home video footage, which rang out around 2 a.m. from their quiet neighborhood near Lake Mayer in the unincorporated part of Chatham County.\nVan Troxell’s wife, dog and two cats were asleep in their bedroom when they were jolted awake by the sound of gunshots. One of those bullets was a mere two feet away from her head, with an additional five damaging their home and car.\nChatham County Police Department (CCPD) officers responded to the scene after three separate callers reported hearing gunfire. Officers spoke with a woman who said she was hosting a birthday party for her juvenile daughter and a group of friends when the shooting began.\nAccording to the police report, there was knocking on the front and side door of the residence, and a group of guys went outside to see who was knocking — that's when the gunfire began.\nOfficers retrieved about 13 shell casings, but all male subjects had since fled the scene, and no one has yet to be arrested.\n“Discharging a firearm in a residential area is a reckless act that could have devastating consequences. The people who committed this crime are potentially facing aggravated assault charges — even though there were no injuries,” the CCPD said to the Savannah Morning News ( SMN ) in an email.\nThis marks the sixth time in the last year that CCPD officers have been called to the house on Whitefield Avenue. The complaints CCPD responded to were about noise, trespassing, overstaying on the property, an overdose on alcohol and prescription pills, and marijuana use.\nCCPD Chief Jeff Hadley has reached out to other Chatham County departments to coordinate a review of the homeowner’s STVR permit.\n“Unauthorized parties are strictly prohibited on Airbnb, and this type of behavior has no place on our platform,” an Airbnb spokesperson wrote in an email to the SMN . “We stand ready to assist law enforcement and have suspended the listing as investigations continue.”\nPatrick Forelli is listed as the owner of the home, and the SMN has reached out on several occasions for a comment and has not heard back. It is noted on Airbnb that Forelli lives in Charlotte and is a sales engineer.\nOne of Forelli's neighbors on Whitefield Avenue, Michael Wood, said since the Airbnb has been listed, he has experienced lawn damage, heard late-night partying and loud noises, and now bullet holes in his house. Since the Sept. 14 shooting, he's begun to put up more cameras around his property.\n\"25 years here and the Airbnb has completely turned the neighborhood upside down,\" Woodcock said. \"He is monetizing the neighborhood at our expense.\"\nShort-term rental, long-term problems Forelli is also listed as the owner of two other Airbnb and VRBO rental properties in the unincorporated part of Chatham County, despite not having a proper permit for them.\nThe Chatham County public information officer confirmed that Forelli has an STVR permit for the house on Whitefield Avenue, but not for the other two properties operating as rental homes.\nChatham County considers a short-term rental as a property that is leased, rented or otherwise traded for money for a stay of less than 30 consecutive days. The homes given STVR licenses by the city need to follow building safety regulations, list a local point of contact, outline the parking rules of the rental, comply with Animal Control Ordinances, and follow other guidelines listed in the city's short term rental ordinance chapter .\nAt least one of those vacation rentals has caused problems for its neighbors.\nMandy Dundon has lived on Garland Drive with her mother since purchasing the home in 2006. She described the neighborhood as quiet and laid-back — until Forelli bought a nearby home in July.\n“It has just been a nightmare,” Dundon said.\nRenovations such as laying a concrete pickleball court in the backyard and a gameroom with a 100’ projector, pool and ping pong table, have caused the house to draw in a rowdy crowd, Dundon said, leading to late-night parties and loud explicit music playing in the early evening hours.\n“It’s disruptive when you hear stuff like that,” she said. “We don’t want a cheap Dave and Busters in our neighborhood, we want neighbors.”\nThe four-bedroom, two-bath house on Garland Drive sleeps 10 guests and is listed at $787 for two nights.\n“Quiet hours are strictly enforced especially in the screened in porch which faces the street. Please refrain from playing loud arcade games such as ping pong after 10 p.m. Please keep the volume at a reasonable level when using the projector. No parties or extra guests over without permission,” the Airbnb listing states.\nBut Dundon said there has been no regard for the noise, and there have been several parties since Forelli has owned the home.\n“It’s selfish,” Dundon said. “There’s a disregard for what you’re doing to a neighborhood.”\nForelli’s other vacation home on Delford Court near the Wilmington River, posted on Airbnb, can host up to 14 guests in its four-bedroom, two-bath home. But, Chatham County STVR regulation states the occupancy rate of such a home should be “no more than two adults per bedroom plus two additional adults are permitted in the rental property.”\n“We just want a normal neighbor,” Van Troxell said.\nAnsley Franco is an intern with the Savannah Morning News, covering public safety and general assignments.
