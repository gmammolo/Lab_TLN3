  "text": "Athena and Hen go off to space in a new 9-1-1 Season 9 teaser. You heard that right! After an asteroid attack, the beloved ABC procedural has revealed another 'out of this world' teaser, where two of the main characters are literally off to space.\nThe teaser proudly boasts:\n''This Fall, they will go where no first responders have gone before.''\nThis is the second teaser unveiled by ABC, where Athena and Hen are suiting up for a space mission. This also explains their absence in the first 9-1-1 Season 9 teaser, where the 'Sky was literally falling.' The first teaser features an asteroid attack on LA as Maddie, Buck, Chimney, and Eddie buckle up for duty. At the end of the teaser, Chimney warns the 118 to brace for impact.\nThese opening emergencies have led the fans to question the realism in 9-1-1 Season 9, as one Reddit user wrote:\n''This is hilariously unrealistic but hey, kill off the best person in the show because you want realism.. Okay buddy.''\nMore on this in our story.\n9-1-1 Season 9 teaser: Fans question Athena's space mission\n9-1-1 Season 9 has unveiled two teasers so far, which will likely become the opening emergencies for the upcoming season. While this certainly increases the stakes for Station 118, fans are questioning the realism of the ABC procedural.\nThese debates are especially rife on social media after the creators justified Bobby's death with 'realism'. While the 9-1-1 fandom was naturally disappointed after Bobby Nash's death in Season 8, the showrunners revealed that it was important to keep their show grounded in reality.\nHowever, fans are questioning how the opening emergencies like 'Sky is falling' and Athena's space mission are anywhere near real. One Reddit user questioned the realism and even asked the creators to bring Bobby back in 9-1-1 Season 9:\n''I thought that the whole point of Bobby's death was for more \"realism\" in the show? At this point they might as well bring him back and do some goofy explanation as to why because this is beyond absurd.''\nKilling Bobby for realism and then teasing such unrealistic emergencies in the 9-1-1 Season 9 teaser felt like a betrayal to fans, and they are questioning it on Reddit left and right.\n''Remember when they killed Bobby for realism.''[one user]wrote\n''Maybe they will find Bobby in space''[another user]had a hilarious reaction\nWhile the show has certainly used outrageous emergencies before, the 9-1-1 Season 9 teaser has outdone itself. Since many fans had given up hope after Bobby's death, these extreme emergencies are making them further question the show's direction.\nThe space narrative has become a sort of marketing gimmick and a social media magnet for shows and movies lately, with the Fast and Furious franchise also tapping into space with their 2021 installment. While the F9 space scene was also controversial, fans do not expect such outrageous emergencies in a grounded show like 9-1-1.\nThe new 9-1-1 Season 9 teaser has certainly left the fans in shock. Here are some more reactions to the teaser:\n''It’s getting hard to defend liking this show.''[one user]wrote\n''I swear at this point season 10 will be athena becoming president. It's getting ridiculous.'' another hilarious reaction[by a user]\n''911’s LA is becoming Gotham City levels of “why the fuck would anyone want to live here”. I wonder if they have like a calendar and see oh it’s August, time for a thousand people to die in a horrific catastrophe.''[another user]agreed\nWhile initial fan reactions to the 9-1-1 Season 9 teasers are extreme, the season could still make a comeback. We understand the creative decisions to increase the stakes this season, after Bobby's death, but the emergencies look too unrealistic. However, many fans are still hopeful that this is just a way to pull back disappointed fans after Season 8 and the procedural will return to its roots in no time.\nReturning cast for Season 9 includes Angela Bassett as Athena, Oliver Stark as Buck, Aisha Hinds as Hen, Kenneth Choi as Chimney, Ryan Guzman as Eddie, and Jennifer Love Hewitt as Maddie.\nTune into 9-1-1 Season 9 on ABC on October 9.\nFor the latest scoops on your favorite TV shows and movies, follow SoapCentral.",
