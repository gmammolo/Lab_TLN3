Credit : Getty\nNEED TO KNOW A bride feels \"devastated\" because her father missed \"most\" of her wedding after he left her reception to watch a football game at a nearby sports bar, and returned just for cake Now, family members are \"split,\" with some saying that the bride is \"overreacting\" and others agreeing that her father's wedding absence was \"rude\" Redditors sided with the bride, arguing that the football game could have been recorded A bride feels betrayed by her father's absence at her recent wedding.\nIn a post on Reddit's \"Wedding Drama\" forum, the newlywed woman explained that her father vanished for a portion of her wedding celebration over the weekend. Since discovering the reason for his disappearance, she can't \"look at him the same way.\"\nInitially, the wedding was \"perfect.\" The bride has a \"close\" relationship with her father, so he naturally \"walked [her] down the aisle, gave a toast, and seemed emotional during the ceremony,\" just like she had always envisioned. However, his exemplary behavior soon came to a sudden halt.\nBride upset with her father (stock photo). Getty\n\"Right after dinner, I couldn’t find him anywhere. I checked outside, the lobby, even the bathrooms. He was gone,\" the bride remembered.\nEventually, the bride discovered that her father, along with a few of her uncles, left the wedding to watch a football game at a nearby sports bar. The group did so without asking for the bride's permission or giving her a heads up.\nDownload Our new app is here! Free, fun and full of exclusives. \"He didn’t come back until the very end of the reception, just in time for cake,\" the bride said.\nHurt by her father's absence on what was supposed to be one of the most meaningful days of their lives, the bride confronted him about his actions.\nRelated Stories Bride's Wedding Venue Dreams Shattered by Grandparents' 1 Demand Man Cancels Honeymoon Because His Wife Can't Afford to Help Pay for It \"He said he 'already did his important part' and didn’t think I’d notice,\" the bride recalled of their conversation.\nShe added, \"I’m devastated.

Getty\nNow, the bride's family is \"split,\" with some members saying she's \"overreacting\" and others agreeing it was \"rude as hell.\"\nRedditors in the comments section weren't as split, with the majority of users siding with the bride. They argued that a parent leaving their child's wedding for hours to watch a football game is \"pretty bad\" and they'd be \"so mad,\" especially because it wasn't even a special game like the Super Bowl.\n\"This is inexcusable and unforgivable in my opinion,\" one person commented. \"I could never feel the same way about my father letting me down in this way.\"\nSports bar (stock photo).
