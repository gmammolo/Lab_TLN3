  "text": "‘House of Guinness’ review: clichés arrive thick and fast in boring and predictable Netflix series\nClichés and unrealistic scenes won’t stop the glossy Netflix show from reeling in the viewers\nIt is difficult to describe Netflix’s House of Guinness. One of its slogans reads “Trouble is brewing,” and it is true that there is a lot of trouble here.\nOn the plus side, it is not every day that you see the construction of social housing as a theme in a TV drama; social housing is even used here as an instrument of courtship. It is not every day either that you see a very handsome hero taking water samples from a river to make sure that the water is not poisoned.\nHave you tried Focail and Conundrum?\nDaily word puzzles designed to test your vocabulary and lateral thinking skills.",
