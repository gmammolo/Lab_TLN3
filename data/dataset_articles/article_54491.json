  "text": "Luke was a well-known and popular figure in Limerick.\nThere's widespread sadness across Limerick's sporting community following the news of the death of Luke Grimes.\nHe passed away on Wednesday evening.\nLuke was a well-known and passionate soccer supporter, particularly associated with Pike Rovers.\nLuke was born with a rare form of dwarfism and was a popular figure in soccer and GAA circles.\nHe was added to the management team at Oscar Traynors in 2016, a particularly proud moment.\nLuke was a lifelong devoted follower of Manchester United.\nLive 95s soccer correspondent Mike Aherne was a friend of Lukes. He paid this tribute this morning.\n\"What an inspiration and character Luke Grimes was. I was lucky enough through Live95 and in particular in my playing days at Pike Rovers to get to know Luke and ultimately call him a great friend. There wasn't a sporting occasion Luke would miss, whether it was Munster, Limerick GAA or across all levels in soccer, but I don't think anybody would dispute his true love was Pike Rovers\", he said on Live 95 radio.\n\"His knowledge of sport was second to none, he had an infectious smile which endeared himself to anybody that was lucky enough to cross his path and meet him. You'd have to be on your A game though because Luke would outthink you and outsmart you in an instant, but he'd always be humble enough to pick up the phone a little bit later in the day and remind you it was all a ball hop\", he added.\nMike Aherne says he has one outstanding memory of Luke.\n\"It was the night Limerick FC met Finn Harps at a sold-out Markets Field and it was Luke on the microphone that got the crowd warmed up for what ultimately turned out to be a historic night where Sean Kelly scored a winner\", he said.\n\"Many a heart will be broken across Limerick City and County with Luke's sad passing and to his parents Noreen and Derek and his sister Danielle and his widest circle of friends we do send our deepest sympathies\", Mike Aherne added.\nA Pike Rovers statement said the club heard the news of Luke's passing with great sadness.\n\"Everyone associated with Pike Rovers and Limerick Soccer Community had come to know and love Luke and his infectious personality and quick wit. He had been a Player, a manager, and above all an incredible supporter of Pike Rovers\", the Club said.\n\"All in Pike Rovers and the broader Limerick Soccer family will miss him.\nBlue Army described Luke's death as 'devastating'.\n\"Everyone in the group who had the pleasure of travelling the country with Luke is absolutely devastated at the news we can't believe we are even writing this. A young man that took every challenge in his stride and was as capable of taking a good slagging as he was at giving them and my god was he able to give a slagging. Luke it was our absolute honour and privilege to spend the time with you we did and we will never forget the many trips we all had together\", they said.\nPaying tribute, St. Patrick’s GAA Club said they are deeply saddened and devastated to learn of Luke Grimes.\n\"Following our draw against neighbours Claughaun, the joy and energy of sport were truly and heartbreakingly put into perspective as the news of Luke’s passing reached us\", a statement said.\n\"Luke was a passionate supporter of St. Patrick’s GAA. He followed the Mullins boys in particular with great pride and enthusiasm, always bringing joy and spirit to the sidelines. In recent times, he especially enjoyed cheering on his nephew, Harry, with that same infectious pride\", they added.\nThe club said that despite facing health challenges throughout his life, Luke taught the club how to embrace each moment and make the most of what we have.\n\"His bravery, love of sport and GAA, laughter, and joy for life will be fondly remembered by everyone who had the privilege of knowing him. The infectious smile, humour and positive energy that Luke shone so brightly\", the Club said.\nAnother friend said we will never see his likes again and described Luke as 'an inspiration to many'.\n\"You showed us all how to embrace life. One’s day was always all the better for meeting you. You tackled everything with a smile, and for that you will be remembered\", they said.",
