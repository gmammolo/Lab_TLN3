  "text": "By James Moules ,\n7 minutes ago CARIBBEAN Airlines is canceling all flights from a major US airport to a popular tourist hotspot within weeks.\nThe changes will come into effect from November - just months after the service resumed following a five year gap.\nCaribbean Airlines says this is intended to help boost its optimisation programme Credit: Alamy Routes from Fort Lauderdale to Montego Bay and Fort Lauderdale to Kingston will face the axe under the plans .\nCaribbean Airlines says this is intended to help boost its optimisation programme.\nA spokesperson said: \"This decision is a strategic step to ensure the continued viability of Caribbean Airlines’ operations in the face of evolving market condition.\"\nBoth services had been brought back within the past year, dealing a further blow to customers .\nThe cancelation further limits options for passengers flying between Florida and Jamaica.\nMontego Bay–Fort Lauderdale was set up again last December, while the Kingston route resumed service earlier this year.\nBut the decision now has come after the routes have underperformed since they were brought back.\nPerformance is understood to have underwhelmed against the company's expectations.\nIt comes as the airline continues to face reported financial issues.\nThe scaling back of routes has seen the company attempt to improve the efficiency of its existing services.\nBoth routes will now be terminated on November 2.\nEnd of the line The airline plans to reallocate aircraft and crew to stronger markets , the Jamaica Gleaner has reported.\nAny passengers who booked their travel after November 1 will be eligible for refunds or travel credits.\nIt comes after a low cost airline is poised to pull out of 11 US cities and put 1,800 flight attendants on furlough.\nSPIRIT Airlines will end flights to Albuquerque, Birmingham, Boise, Chattanooga, Columbia, Portland, Salt Lake City and the California cities of Sacramento, Oakland, San Diego and San Jose from 2 October.\nSpirit said the \"difficult decision\" was made to match cabin crew numbers with expected flight demand amid its ongoing bankruptcy process.\n\"We recognize the impact of this decision on affected team members, and we are committed to treating them with care and respect during this process,\" the airline said.\nSpirit Airlines is pulling out of several US cities Credit: Getty",
