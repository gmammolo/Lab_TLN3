  "text": "If you looked forward to getting your hands on McDonald’s new Caramel Loaded McFlurry, you may face a letdown. The mega-fast food chain has announced it has removed the item from its menu due to what they are calling a 'quality control issue.' And, given that parents often take their kids to McDonald's for a quick treat, this might be a hard pill to swallow.\nWhat happened to the Caramel Loaded McFlurry?\nOn September 10, the brand introduced the decadent dessert as a seasonal item, describing it as a swirl of soft dairy ice cream with caramel cubes, white chocolate cookie pieces, milk chocolate chips, and a salted caramel drizzle.\n© Shutterstock\nIn reality? It was hit or miss. Almost immediately after the introduction of the item, customers began sharing their experiences, stating the caramel cubes were too hard to eat, making it an unpleasant and maybe even painful experience.\nWhat customers said\nOne customer, Helen Richards, shared a review with her friends on Facebook when she stated: 'Be careful, the caramel bits in it are rock hard, not soft, so it doesn’t mix into the ice cream and you end up hitting an iceberg because they are cold and hard, and you can’t enjoy your ice cream.'\nPeople on Reddit weighed in, too. One commenter stated it was like 'gnawing on a roof tile.' Not exactly the satisfying product McDonald’s was looking for on the menu!\nThe backlash spread widely, but some people still felt pleased. Some fans actually said they liked the crunch, including one customer who shared: 'Don’t know about anyone else, but I actually liked the hard caramel bits.'\nSo while the reactions were varied, they were strong enough for McDonald’s to take action.\nMcDonald’s official statement\nMcDonald’s announced it would stop serving the McFlurry, saying, 'We identified a quality control issue with the Caramel Loaded McFlurry, so we removed it from our menu. At McDonald’s, we prioritise quality control, and we feel disappointed any time we fall below our high standards.We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience.'\nFor now, it has disappeared from menus again.\n© Shutterstock\nWhat this means for families\nIf your little ones were keen to try the new McFlurry, it may be wise to temper their hopes next time you visit the drive-thru. McDonald’s still offers many other frozen desserts, but it has taken the McFlurry off the menu for now.\nAnd while it can be disappointing to have new menu items taken away, parents can find comfort in knowing that the company is doing the right thing when it comes to food quality and safety. The last thing you want when you buy a treat is a sore tooth!\nWhat happens next\nWe’ll see if McDonald’s brings back the Caramel Loaded McFlurry once it resolves the issue or rolls out another limited-edition flavour instead. Either way, we’ll be waiting for updates, and hopefully the next treat will be easier on our gums!",
