  "text": "A vet who often has to euthanize pets without their owner present has left the internet in tears with her realization about “the hardest part” of her job.\nLauren McNamara has been a veterinarian for four years, and during that time she’s helped countless animals make a full recovery and get back to their usual selves. But sadly, that isn’t always the case, and one of the most difficult aspects of her work is having to euthanize pets.\nMcNamara, 26, told Newsweek that she often has to euthanize dogs without their owners in the room, which can be really challenging both for the dog and for her. It happened frequently during the Covid pandemic because owners weren’t allowed in close contact, but it still occurs now when owners don’t feel like they’re capable of watching that heartbreaking moment unfold.\n“Most of the time they are unwell or in pain, which means they’re stressed and scared,” McNamara said. “During the pandemic (because of lockdown rules), owners weren’t allowed to be present. I had to wear a mask, take the dog away from their owner, and even though I wanted to hold them and cuddle them, it would stress them out even more.”\nThankfully, McNamara, of Australia, is regularly joined at work by her rescue dog, Nala. She’s an 8-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier and Kelpie mix, and she brings so much comfort to her owner.\nBut as it turns out, it’s not just McNamara that she can help.\nFor McNamara, euthanizing a dog without their owner is “the hardest part” about being a vet. But having Nala present during the procedure has proven to be such a help for other dogs in their final moments.\n“Dogs are pack animals they are wired to look to each other for protection and guidance. When Nala’s in the room, I see them relax and settle. She would lay with them while I put the IV catheter in, and seeing the bond I had with Nala would mean the other dog trusted me more,” McNamara said.\nShe continued: “I hated the thought of their last memory being with me, a stranger, and scared. Nala would lay with them as they passed. It was peaceful and seeing the comfort she bought them also bought me comfort.”\nWhile McNamara will gladly provide medical help, there’s a certain “emotional relief” that only Nala can offer to other dogs. Indeed, she says she \"couldn't do [her] job without\" Nala anymore.\nMany owners have thanked McNamara and Nala for being their when they couldn’t. It’s not an easy decision by any means, and the thought that their beloved pup passed away peacefully with a friend by their side is such a beautiful thought to hold onto. Nala has certainly earned her fair share of treats from grateful owners.\n“There is an innate dog to dog connection that I could never match,” McNamara told Newsweek. “Human to dog connection takes time and trust. It’s something that we teach them, but their connection to other dogs they are born with. Because of my bond with Nala, she trusted me and knew what was happening and why. She would pass this onto my patients. It’s nature and it’s amazing to see.”\nMcNamara documents the highs and lows of her job on social media (@vet_lauren_ on TikTok and Instagram). It’s important for her to show all aspects of her work, so she shared a video about how Nala helps other dogs in their dying moments, and the clip touched so many hearts online.\nIn a matter of days, the video has gone viral on TikTok with over 508,400 views and more than 38,900 likes at the time of writing.\nMany social media users have praised Nala for her heroic companionship, but others questioned why owners wouldn’t be with their pet during their last moments.\nMcNamara said: “Euthanasia is such a heartbreaking but important part of veterinary work, and I wanted to show the beauty that can exist in those moments. Sharing Nala’s role was my way of honoring how animals support each other, and to remind people how deeply they connect beyond what we see.\n“It’s been emotional but also very meaningful to see how many people resonate with the bond between animals. Of course, if you are able to be there for your dog’s final moments, I always try to get owners to stay, but it’s hard,” she continued.\nThe viral TikTok video has generated over 1,200 comments so far, as many pet owners shared their own experiences.\nOne comment reads: “I know I’d be a sobbing mess but i wouldn’t want them to look around and realize I’m not there.”\nAnother TikTok user wrote: “what a good dog, comforting the others as they go.”\nWhile another person replied: “This is so hard to watch.”\nDo you have funny and adorable videos or pictures of your pet you want to share?
