  "text": "After years of serving up unforgettable meals and quirky vibes, the Exit Zero Filling Station in West Cape May is officially closing its doors. To clear out the space, they’re hosting a three-day closing sale packed with unique finds—think glasses, dishes, kitchen gear, bar stools, coffee dispensers, and more.\n🕚 Sale Hours: Monday–Wednesday, 11 AM to 2 PM 📍 Location: 110 Sunset Boulevard, West Cape May\nOnce the sale wraps, the property heads to the auction block. Opening bids start at $2 million, with online bidding running September 26 through October 1. Owner Jack Wright chose the auction route after previously listing the property for $4.7 million. This prime parcel spans an entire block, just three blocks from the beach and steps from the Cape May–Lewes Ferry Terminal, with frontage on three sides—making it a rare Shore gem.\nThe restaurant’s plenary liquor license has already been sold for $850,000 to local developer Curtis Bashaw. However, the iconic outdoor dining setup—featuring a converted 1949 Chevy truck that seated eight—won’t be part of the auction.\nInterested in bidding? Head to the Tranzon website to register and view the property. Don’t miss your chance to own a slice of Jersey Shore history as Exit Zero turns the page on its next chapter.",
