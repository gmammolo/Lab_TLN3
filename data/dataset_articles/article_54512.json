  "text": "Cardi B dropped a bombshell about her cosmetic journey and a pricey piercing during Wednesday’s (September 24) episode of the “Call Her Daddy” podcast, revealing she had butt reduction surgery to remove silicone implants.\nThe Grammy-winning rapper, 32, opened up while explaining why she wouldn’t recommend the $13,000 butt crack piercing she recently got.\n“It didn’t hurt, but I’m not going to recommend it to people because I had surgery,” she told host Alex Cooper while sporting boyfriend Stefon Diggs’ NFL jersey.\n“I have surgery on my butt. You know, sometimes people say that my butt is too big, but they don’t understand. They already did a butt surgery to reduce my ass,” Cardi said.\nShe likened the procedure to a tummy tuck, explaining, “So, you know, like when people do a tummy tuck in your stomach? I practically did a tummy tuck on my ass, like on top, so I could remove some biopolymers.”\nThe surgery left her with partial numbness. “So, like the top of my ass, like that skin part is like numb, like a tummy tuck. So when I pierced my ass, I ain’t felt s###.”\nAs for the piercing itself, Cardi revealed, “It was the easiest piercing ever. It cost me $13,000 because it was real diamonds. And guess what? It went down the toilet.”\nThe Bronx-born rapper has long been transparent about her cosmetic history. She previously admitted to getting breast implants at 19 and undergoing “illegal butt injections” early in her career.\nOver the years, she’s also had liposuction, veneers and breast augmentation. In August 2023, she revealed she had 95 percent of her biopolymers removed.\nDespite outside opinions, Cardi made it clear she’s content with her body. “I look at myself in the mirror, and it’s like I really wouldn’t change a thing. Maybe I would like my butt to be smaller, but it’s like I said, it’s really hard for my butt to be smaller.”\nShe also addressed the pressure to go under the knife again. “People be like, ‘Well, you need to reduce your butt more.’ And it’s like, I think you guys think that people just plug something inside my a###### and just suck it out.”\n“For me to reduce my butt, I would have to literally sit on a table, get cut from the bottom, get cut from the top, and be embarrassed for like three months,” she added.\nCardi ended the conversation with a firm stance. “So, it’s like, I’m not going to put myself in that position again because you don’t like my body. I’m comfortable. I learned to live with it. I don’t get no complaints [from] nobody, and it is what it is.”",
