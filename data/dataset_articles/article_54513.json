  "text": "Cardi B has never been shy about sharing intimate details of her life, but her latest confession may top them all. The rapper revealed she once flushed a $13,000 diamond butt crack piercing straight down the toilet during a candid conversation on Alex Cooper’s 'Call Her Daddy' podcast. The “WAP” hitmaker opened up about the incident on the September 24 episode of Alex Cooper’s Call Her Daddy podcast. While discussing her piercings, the 32-year-old recalled how the pricey jewellery vanished. “It cost me like, $13,000 because it was real diamonds,” Cardi told Cooper. “And guess what? It went down the toilet. It was like a month. It was like, ‘Hold on.’ I was looking around, I was looking at my pants and my panties and stuff and I’m like, ‘Yep, went down the toilet.’” The Grammy winner first debuted the unusual piercing, which featured double diamond studs, in January. At the time, she described it as the “easiest piercing ever.” Even so, she admitted it’s not something she would suggest to fans, mainly because her body was already altered by past procedures. “I have surgery on my butt,” Cardi explained. “They already did a bu*t surgery to reduce my a**. You know like when people do a tummy tuck on your stomach? I practically did a tummy tuck on my a**, like on top.” She added that after removing biopolymers from her body, the top of her butt remained numb. That’s why when she got pierced there, she “didn’t feel s--t.” Still, Cardi stressed that her experience wasn’t exactly relatable. “It didn’t hurt, but I’m not going to recommend it to people because I had surgery,” she said, clarifying why it was tolerable for her.

Currently pregnant with her fourth child—her first with Diggs—the rapper admitted she has thought about further reducing her curves but finds it difficult. “I look at myself in the mirror and it’s like I really wouldn’t change a thing,” she shared. “Maybe I would like my bu*t to be smaller, but it’s like I said, it’s really hard for my butt to be smaller.” She also pushed back against criticism that her figure should be downsized even more. “I already did a reduction. And… people be like, ‘Well, you need to reduce your bu*t more.’ For now, Cardi isn’t planning to revisit the piercing. As she bluntly put it: “I just haven’t been in the mood.”\",",
