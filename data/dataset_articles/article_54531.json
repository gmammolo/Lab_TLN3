In Kerrville, Emily retired from The Adult and Community Education Center for the Kerrville Independent School District. She was deeply devoted to her community and served in numerous leadership roles with the Kerrville Host Lions Club, where she received many honors and contributed greatly.\nA woman of many talents, Emily was also a gifted gourmet cook and co-authored several volumes of The Four Ingredient Cookbook, with dear friend Linda Coffee, which delighted countless families with its creativity and simplicity.\nEmily was preceded in death by her parents, Marvin and Ninon Johnson; her brothers, Patrick and Michael Johnson; and her sons, Christopher Bryant Hix and Jerry Charles “Charlie” Hix Jr.\nShe is survived by her husband, Ron Curry; his daughter, Shelley Curry; her daughter and son-in-law, Jenny and Walter Stanley; daughter-in-law, Barbara Hix; sisters-in-law, Sherri Curry (and her husband, John Spreen) and Kristi Curry; stepdaughter, Ashli Guild; stepson Matt Cale; grandchildren Harlee, Brianna, and Hunther Hix, Chloe Stanley, Brittany Underwood, Tyler, Tanner, and Trevor Guild; and great-grandchildren Liam and Charlie Underwood and Denver and Savannah Guild.
