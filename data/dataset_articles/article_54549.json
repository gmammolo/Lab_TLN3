  "text": "Pathetic: OG Fans Destroy Screen in Bengaluru!\nFor a long time now, theatre management across South, India have been very vigilant about the kind of damage that they are suffering due to the overenthusiasm of fans\nBy:Tupaki Desk| 25 Sept 2025 3:24 PM IST\nFor a long time now, theatre management across South, India have been very vigilant about the kind of damage that they are suffering due to the overenthusiasm of fans. This was again to be witnessed as OG fans created a lot of unnecessary madness.\nIncidentally, this is the case of a troubled cinema theatre in KR Puram area of Bengaluru, which has suffered due to the enthusiasm of fans on the occasion of release of OG.\nReportedly a group of fans who happened to be hard-core cinemagoers destroyed a cinema screen in Bengaluru. This incident happened at the screening of OG last night when fans took a sword into the theatre.\nThe fans could not control the excitement and ended up slashing the theatre screen with this sword that they had carried with themselves and destroyed the presentation picture.\nConsidering the fact that Cinema screens cost a lot of money and often incur losses of ₹10 lakh, this is a pathetic gesture. Reportedly senior fans had to pacify the situation and promise a feasible solution to the theatre management and only then did the show progress as expected.\nIt is pathetic to see theatre management having to suffer such financial losses and this isn’t what’s expected from fans, regardless of the hype and anticipation that they have for a film.\nThis isn’t just about one particular hero fan group, but the situation with the entire Telugu fandom. Better measures are expected from fans as incurring, such losses would not help anyone at all.",
