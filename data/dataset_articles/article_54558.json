  "text": "All good things must come to an end, right? That seems to be the case with the 2026 Subaru BRZ, which will no longer be the affordable sports car champion it once was heading into the new year. That's because the coupe will carry a much steeper starting price compared to the current 2025 model when it reaches showrooms early next year, to the tune of a $5,000 increase.\nFor years, the BRZ and its Toyota GR86 sibling have offered enthusiasts an affordable first step on the performance ladder. Though the cars don't pack powerful engines, their dynamic handling qualities – thanks to a lightweight rear-wheel-drive chassis with a low center of gravity – are traits typically found in much more expensive models. They also come standard with a 6-speed manual transmission, delivering an analog driving experience that's becoming harder to find with each passing year. Crucially, they've also been attainable. But for the Subaru, that's no longer the case, as for the 2026 model year, the BRZ starts at an MSRP of $35,860. Ouch.\nNew Pricing Reflects Streamlined Lineup\nSubaru announced 2026 model year pricing this week, and we were not ready for such a big increase. Add the mandatory $1,195 destination charge, and you're looking at a minimum of $37,055 out the door. That’s encroaching on luxury car territory. Comparatively, the 2026 Toyota GR86 starts at just $30,800 excluding destination charges, and even with them, is available for just under $32,000.\nThe current second-generation BRZ carried a starting price of only $28,955 when it was first introduced for the 2022 model year. That figure applied to a base BRZ Premium model, which Subaru has eliminated for 2026, which helps explain the increase in pricing. According to the automaker, only about one out of every 10 BRZ buyers chose the Premium, so for most customers, the higher starting price won’t make much of a difference. Regardless, price increases have been applied to all trims, albeit in relatively small increments.\nThe 2026 lineup consists of the Limited, tS, and a new Series.Yellow special edition (also available on the WRX). Subaru will offer just 350 examples of the Series.Yellow, each finished in Sunrise Yellow paint and fitted exclusively with the manual transmission. The special edition also adds exterior and interior accents borrowed from the tS.\nPricing for the full range is as follows:\n2026 Subaru BRZ Pricing Comparison |\n|||\n---|---|---|---|\nModel |\n2026 Pricing* |\n2025 Pricing |\nDifference |\nBRZ Premium |\n- |\n$31,095 |\nDiscontinued |\nBRZ Limited |\n$35,860 |\n$33,745 |\n+$2,115 |\nBRZ tS |\n$38,360 |\n$36,245 |\n|\nBRZ Series.Yellow |\n$39,360 |\n- |\nNew for 2026 |\n*All prices exclude a $1,195 destination charge. |\nEvery BRZ features a 2.4-liter flat-4 engine producing 228 hp at 7,000 rpm and 184 lb-ft of torque at 3,700 rpm. A 6-speed manual transmission comes standard, while the Limited can be equipped with a 6-speed paddle-shifted automatic for an extra $850. The curb weight is 2,837 pounds, and the car will deliver 0-60 mph times of about six seconds with the manual and seven seconds with the automatic.\nA High Level Of Standard Equipment\nSubaru adds plenty of standard equipment to help justify the higher prices. Features include a Torsen limited-slip differential, LED headlights, 18-inch wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires, a seven-inch digital gauge cluster, a leather steering wheel, and a stability control system with a Track mode. The gauge cluster can display amps, coolant temperature, or lateral g-forces. In Track mode, the tachometer switches from a conventional circular design to a linear graph. For infotainment, all trims get an eight-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Standard driver-assist tech includes adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, and lane-departure warning.\nAbove the Limited sits the tS. First introduced for 2024, the tS adds performance enhancements from Subaru’s STI performance division – its name stands for “tuned by STI.” The upgrades are mild but effective, with sharper suspension featuring STI-tuned struts and Hitachi dampers, Brembo brakes with larger rotors and calipers, and interior details like Ultrasuede trim, blue accent stitching, and multiple STI logos. The tS also rides on 18-inch wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires.\nSource: Subaru",
