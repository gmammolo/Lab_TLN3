  "text": "WWE Superstar John Cena lost to Brock Lesnar at Wrestlepalooza in an almost one-sided bout. The Beast Incarnate nearly squashed The Franchise Player in the tail end of the latter’s career, setting up several Cena fans for disappointment. Interestingly, it has now been revealed that Triple H ordered Mr Never Give Up’s sacrifice on September 20 for a big Lesnar match at WrestleMania 42.\nAccording to a new report by Bodyslam, the former three-time Universal Champion could be booked against Bron Breakker. While no concrete plans have been made so far, internal discussions suggest that the two will have a big match and could likely face each other at WM42.\nBron Breakker vs. Brock Lesnar has been talked about taking place in the future.\n— Wrestle Ops (@WrestleOps)\nPotentially at WrestleMania 42 next year.\n(via[@BodyslamNet])[pic.twitter.com/N7A7u1Zff1][September 24, 2025]\nThus, Brock Lesnar may have crushed John Cena and reacquired his insurmountable in-ring status to increase the stakes of this match whenever it happens. This must be why the record-setting 17-time WWE world champion lost without gaining any momentum despite being on his farewell tour.\nAs per Wrestling Observer Radio’s Dave Meltzer, this could be Cena’s way to put over another guy on his way out of the industry. However, while Mr Hustle Loyalty and Respect may have been willing to bite the bullet, his father, John Cena Sr., isn’t pleased with the outcome of Wrestlepalooza.\nWhat Did John Cena Sr. Say About His Son’s Squash Defeat at Wrestlepalooza?\nJohn Cena Sr. recently appeared for an interview with Sportskeeda’s WrestleBinge podcast. Speaking about The Franchise Player’s match on September 20, Cena Sr. said that the second he saw Paul Heyman introduce Brock Lesnar as the “Last real a** kicker,” he knew that the match would be one-sided.\nHe noted that he instantly knew that the squash from the 2014 SummerSlam was going to be repeated. Stating his dissatisfaction, the 81-year-old said that Triple H could have made The Beast Incarnate look strong without giving John Cena such a big loss.\nAlthough he expressed his disappointment, he also noted what WWE could have done to make Brock Lesnar look big without annihilating his son in the ring.\nSo a smart thing would have been, at some point, maybe we had an outside interference. Maybe we had a — I don’t like countouts — but the outside interference setting up the next match with Cena, whomever that might have been, would have been a better way to take it out than the way I saw it go down. (24:32 – 24:51)\nThe idea of a last-minute interference does sound like a good way to bail the record-setting 17-time WWE world champion out. He also pointed out that several kids who were cheering for Cena ended up crying, and that this wasn’t a good way to end a match for a guy who is on his way out.\nWhile John Cena Sr. has several grievances against the way Wrestlepalooza was booked, he isn’t too happy with the way the rest of his son’s farewell tour has turned out. Moreover, he is especially unhappy with the forced heel turn The Never Seen 17.\nJohn Cena Sr. Criticizes the Infamous Heel Turn of His Son\nThe 2025 Elimination Chamber saw John Cena join hands with The Rock and turn heel, attacking Cody Rhodes. Speaking in the same interview with Sportskeeda WrestleBinge, Cena Sr. pointed out that while the decision definitely had shock value, it destroyed The Franchise Player’s entire story so far.\nTurning John Cena heel was a great idea; the shock factor was great, but I think the storyline was destroyed. And that was a poor move in my opinion because it was a big gamble for everyone that was involved. And to see how it started and then to see the characters that were involved no longer be present, the heel turn almost became non-essential. (12:30 – 13:01)\nNotably, while The Rock had presented himself as the catalyst behind Cena’s heel turn, he didn’t make any appearances after the Elimination Chamber. Moreover, when the heel turn turned bland, WWE suddenly hit reverse gear just two days before the 2025 SummerSlam to turn John Cena babyface again.\nThis disappointed several fans, especially since their hero had announced his retirement tour in July 2024. Thus, WWE had more than ample time to give one of its most decorated legends a blockbuster exit. However, things have only gone south for him so far.\nDo you agree with what John Cena Sr. said about his son’s farewell tour and his Wrestlepalooza match against Brock Lesnar? Do you think that Cena’s upcoming Crown Jewel match with AJ Styles will finally give fans something good? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.",
