  "text": "While you might miss Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt's chemistry on the big screen with Sunny Sanskari Ki Tulsi Kumari, the very day you can stream their Two Much episode\nLast Updated: 03.39 PM, Sep 25, 2025\nTwo Much's first episode with Salman Khan and Aamir Khan is now out on OTT. Although it has failed to strike a chord, despite Kajol and Twinkle Khanna's attempts with the superstars, the series is buzzing for a new reason now. The next episode, scheduled for October 2 release, will be with Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt. This means that it would be out with the theatrical release of Sunny Sanskari Ki Tulsi Kumari, which many consider as Dulhania 3 (even if the makers have refused to call the movie a part of the franchise).\nVarun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt have been confirmed for Two Much. The recently released episode with Salman and Aamir Khan confirms that the next guests on the show are indeed Varun and Alia.\nAlso Read: Two Much with Kajol & Twinkle first impression: Aamir Khan’s sincerity brings calm; Salman Khan’s stubbornness stirs chaos in a spicy slow-burn premiere\nVarun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt's Two Much episode will be out right when Sunny Sanskari Ki Tulsi Kumari releases in theatres. The movie, often confused as Dulhania 3, brings Varun back with Karan Johar and Shashank Khaitan. Although Alia Bhatt has been the female face with the trio, Janhvi Kapoor has joined the cast this time around. The film also features Sanya Malhotra and Rohit Saraf in the lead roles.\nAlso Read: Two Much with Kajol and Twinkle: Aamir Khan and Salman Khan kick off premiere episode of talk show\nAlia Bhatt was asked if she would be willing to work on Dulhania 3, and the actress did say an instant yes if the right script came her way. Karan Johar also asked the media to refrain from calling Sunny Sanskari Ki Tulsi Kumari Dulhania 3, thus hinting that an official film on the Dulhania franchise might be on hold and that Sunny Sanskari Ki Tulsi Kumari might just be a collaboration film and not the continuation of Dulhania franchise. Nonetheless, Dussehra would definitely be a treat for Varun as well as Varia fans.\nQ: Where can I watch Two Much with Kajol and Twinkle Khanna?\nA: Two Much with Kajol and Twinkle Khanna will start streaming on Prime Video from September 25, with a new episode every Thursday.\nQ: Who are the hosts of Two Much?\nA: Kajol and Twinkle Khanna are the hosts of Two Much.\nQ: What is Two Much about?\nA: Two Much with Kajol and Twinkle Khanna is a new chat show set to deliver an unlimited dose of entertainment, unfiltered moments, laughter, and surprises with some of the most celebrated names in Indian cinema.",
