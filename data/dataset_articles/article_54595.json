  "text": "I used to sleep with my math tutor\nDear Pastor,\nGreetings to you and all family members on Power 106 FM. I am a regular reader of your column and I listen to you on radio.\nI know many of the callers by name. I am living outside of Jamaica, but I still read your column. It helps me to keep up with my fellow Jamaicans. Jamaica is still the best place in the world. I started to read the column when I was a young girl. I am now 30 and I have two children by a white man.\nI am going to talk to you freely. I had two boyfriends before I came to live in America. I was never a bad girl, but I was sexually active. I used to love having sex. I thought I would have married one of these men. I was slow in doing mathematics, so this guy used to meet with me every weekend and help me to do mathematics and his payment was to have sex with him. He taught me everything. I used to tell my parents that we were meeting at the library with some of my school friends, but I did not always go to the library. This guy had a car and sometimes after we spent time studying, I went to his yard and we had sex. He was always very careful. He always had condoms with him.\nThen I wanted some money and he did not have it to give me, so I had sex with a friend of my mother. He was twice my age and I asked him for the money and offered to have sex with him. He gave me more than I asked him for. That was the only time I cheated on my boyfriend. This man has the largest penis I have ever seen. I felt it to my back. I could hardly move after he discharged. I was so scared, but I blamed myself because I offered myself to him. I did not do that again.\nThis man I am married to travelled to Jamaica with a church group and when he saw me, he fell in love with me and asked me if I would love to go to America, and I told him yes. He returned home and kept corresponding with me. He was very kind. Seven months after, he returned to Jamaica and we got married. I miss Jamaican men; they have the good stuff and they know how to use it. My husband satisfies me, but the guy who helped me with mathematics was still my best lover. When I told him I was going to get married, he cried, but he wished me well. I gave one of my sons this guy's middle name. I could never tell my son that. This white guy is still active in missionary work and he is planning to go on another trip and I am going with him.\nI felt I had to write to you to encourage you to keep up your good work. I admire you a lot. You do not condemn anybody regardless of what they have done. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope to see it published in THE STAR.\nB.R.\nDear B.R.,\nI am happy that you have taken the time to write to me and that you have got married.\nI am glad that you did not become pregnant before you got married. Your math teacher did not teach you for free; he assisted you in math, but it came with a heavy cost. I know you said that you are not a bad girl, but when you had a particular need, you offered yourself to a friend of your mother and he did not have mercy on you. He was a man who was gifted. But you took what he had because according to you, you had a need.\nI am glad that this white man married you. So from what you have written, you have settled down pretty well. I wish you well as you go on the missionary trip. Please let me hear about it after you have returned home. I wish you the very best.\nPastor",
