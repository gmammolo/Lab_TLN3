  "text": "A POPULAR high street retailer has launched a massive clearance sale.\nThe British shoe chain has slashed down prices on their stock ahead of closure.\nOFFICE in Bristol , located in Cabot Circus, is closing down but it's not all bad news .\nThe store is planning to undergo a refurbishment and re-open again.\nBut before then, customers can snap up great bargains on the remaining stock.\nSome shoes are selling for as low as £10 at the store.\nA poster on the store’s window reads: “Exciting refurb underway.\n“Your new OFFICE store will be opening here again soon!\"\nBefore the reopening, shoppers have been redirected to the nearest store in Bath.\nCustomers can also shop online at the brand's official website and order delivery.\nOther shop closures This comes after a nostalgic British shoe brand has launched a huge sale with up to 70 per cent off everything after announcing sudden closure.\nIrregular Shoes is clearing out its entire stock before closing its doors for good.\nHowever, the retailer hasn't confirmed the official last day of trading yet.\nMeanwhile, Primark has also confirmed its first shop closure in a decade.\nThe fashion and homeware retailer is to shut its branch in the Orchards Shopping Centre in Dartford next year .\nPrimark director of sales for UK South and South East Philippa Nibbs told The Sun: “Following careful consideration, we’re proposing to close our Dartford store in the new year.\n“This proposal has been informed by the significant and extensive repair work the building requires.\n“Our store remains open for now, and we’ll communicate further updates in due course.\n\"This decision has been driven by circumstances unique to this store and our commitment to the high street and UK retail remains.\"\nRETAIL PAIN IN 2025 The British Retail Consortium has predicted that the Treasury's hike to employer NICs will cost the retail sector £2.3billion.\nResearch by the British Chambers of Commerce shows that more than half of companies plan to raise prices by early April.\nA survey of more than 4,800 firms found that 55% expect prices to increase in the next three months, up from 39% in a similar poll conducted in the latter half of 2024.\nThree-quarters of companies cited the cost of employing people as their primary financial pressure.\nThe Centre for Retail Research (CRR) has also warned that around 17,350 retail sites are expected to shut down this year.\nIt comes on the back of a tough 2024 when 13,000 shops closed their doors for good, already a 28% increase on the previous year.\nProfessor Joshua Bamfield, director of the CRR said: \"The results for 2024 show that although the outcomes for store closures overall were not as poor as in either 2020 or 2022, they are still disconcerting, with worse set to come in 2025.\"\nProfessor Bamfield has also warned of a bleak outlook for 2025, predicting that as many as 202,000 jobs could be lost in the sector.\n\"By increasing both the costs of running stores and the costs on each consumer's household it is highly likely that we will see retail job losses eclipse the height of the pandemic in 2020.\"",
