  "text": "Anushka Shetty’s action drama Ghaati turned into one of the year’s biggest disappointments. Released on September 5 with fair expectations, the Krish directorial collapsed from the very first day. Even Anushka’s star power could not draw crowds, leaving the film tagged as a wasted chance.\nThe failure is clear from its early digital debut. Ghaati starts streaming on Prime Video from September 26, only three weeks after its theatrical release. Such a short OTT gap highlights the scale of the box office disaster.\nTouted as Anushka’s action comeback and compared to Pushpa, the film quickly fell flat. Negative word-of-mouth spread fast, keeping audiences away. The Anushka-Krish pairing helped secure a premium OTT deal, which now stands as its only lifeline.\nFor you as a viewer, the digital release offers a chance to watch Ghaati and judge it for yourself. Many fans will revisit Anushka’s performance to understand what went wrong and how the film missed its mark on the big screen.",
