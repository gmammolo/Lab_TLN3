Brian previously worked for Bustle, Billboard, Forbes, MTV, Mashable and Men's Health. People Editorial Guidelines Published on January 5, 2024 04:51PM EST Photo: Getty\nA 24-year-old wedding guest — whose fiancé proposed to her on Christmas Eve just days before they attended her childhood family friend’s wedding together — is being called out online for not hiding her engagement ring and taking attention away from the bride.\nWondering if she was in the wrong, she detailed her dilemma in the popular subreddit “Am I The A ?” Her Reddit post , titled \"AITA for keeping my engagement a secret until my friend's wedding?\" Was shared two days ago and has attracted a flurry of reactions since, including nearly 1,000 comments.\nShe explained that she and her 25-year-old partner were waiting to announce their engagement until after they received photos from an upcoming maternity shoot.\nBy the time they attended the wedding, the couple had told only a few close relatives and friends.
