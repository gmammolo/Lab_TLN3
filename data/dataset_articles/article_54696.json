  "text": "It is Hungary’s architecture, abundant thermal springs and magical history that make it an exceptionally popular destination. However, alongside its famous sights, the country also hides secrets that many visitors are unaware of. How many of the facts below did you know? Visitors are probably familiar with Lake Balaton, also known as the Hungarian Sea, as it is one of the country’s most popular holiday destinations. Or they might guess that Hungarian is one of the most difficult languages in the world for English speakers to learn. One reason is that it contains almost twice as many letters as English. But they may also have heard of the ski resorts in Hungary, including the Eplény Ski Arena, which has earned the nickname “Little Alps”, [Helló Magyar writes](https://hellomagyar.hu/2024/01/03/ezeket-az-erdekessegeket-mondd-a-kulfoldieknek-magyarorszag-kapcsan/). [Corinthia](https://www.corinthia.com/en-gb/budapest/discover-budapest/10-things-you-never-knew-about-hungary/) has gathered some interesting facts about Hungary that are probably not known to foreigners, but perhaps not even to us Hungarians. 1. Hungary’s wines The oldest official wine region in the world is not Provence, but Tokaj in Hungary. Experts have found traces of viticulture dating back more than 2,000 years. Louis XIV of France, the Sun King himself, once declared Tokaj “wine of kings, king of wines”. 2. Elvis Presley has Hungarian citizenship What does Elvis Presley have to do with Hungary? In 1957, he paid tribute to the then-recent anti-Soviet uprising by singing Peace in the Valley. In return, Hungary granted Elvis posthumous citizenship in 2011 in recognition of his support many years ago. 3. The record-breaking synagogue Budapest has the largest synagogue in Europe and the second largest in the world. Standing on the corner of Dohány Street, the rose-gilded facade is hard to miss. Its interior can accommodate up to 3,000 people. 4. Underground mysteries Budapest is renowned for its thermal baths, but the underground labyrinth beneath them is more of a mystery. You will find the world’s largest thermal cave system here. Put on a helmet and explore the pink-coloured Szemlő Hill (Szemlő-hegy), one of the few caves open to the public. 5. We also have a mummified king Mummies are not only in Egypt! Walk over to St. Stephen’s Basilica in Budapest and you’ll find something unexpected kept in the chapel. The mummified right hand of King Stephen, the country’s first monarch, is displayed in an ornate glass case and is considered a holy relic, Corinthia writes. 6. World-changing inventors Perhaps not surprisingly for us Hungarians, Hungary is home to many inventors. In fact, it was not Ferdinand Porsche but Hungarian engineer Béla Barényi who designed the legendary Volkswagen Beetle. The architect Ernő Rubik created the Rubik’s Cube, and László Bíró was the inventor of the ballpoint pen. 7. Silver screen is not unknown territory Hollywood also owes much of its success to Hungary. The founders of Paramount Pictures and the Fox Film Corporation, Adolf Zukor and Fried Vilmos Fried, also known as William Fox, both hail from here. Michael Curtiz, the Oscar-winning director of Casablanca, was born in Budapest as Mihály Kertész.
