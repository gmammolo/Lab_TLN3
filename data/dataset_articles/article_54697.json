  "text": "The 'reU' reusable water bottle concept has been designed by Rishikesh Sonawane as an eco-friendly alternative to conventional water bottle designs. The water bottle is constructed with layers of cardboard, aluminum and polyethylene, which gives it just the right level of rigidity for everyday use but also supports easier recycling. This combats against the traditional design of reusable water bottles that are often plastic or metal that is difficult or simply not feasible to be recycled.\nThe 'reU' reusable water bottle concept is not meant to last forever like many water bottle designs on the market, but can instead be used over and over before properly recycling it. This will come as welcome news to those who want to use a fresh vessel on a regular basis without being too wasteful.\nThe 'reU' Reusable Water Bottle Concept is Recyclable\n[Michael Hemsworth](/Michael.Hemsworth)— January 5, 2024 — [Eco](/eco)\nReferences:\nyankodesign\nTrend Themes\n1.
