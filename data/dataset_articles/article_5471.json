  "text": "Mötley Crüe claim 'decisive victory' in legal fight with Mick Mars\n\"The band has been fully vindicated—legally, financially, and factually.\"\nMötley Crüe’s legal team have announced that the band has won a “decisive victory” against former guitarist, Mick Mars.\nIn April 2023, Mick Mars launched legal proceedings against his former Mötley Crüe band mates alleging they had forced him out and had withheld information about the various businesses that he has a 25% ownership share in.\nThe 74-year-old guitarist and founding member also claimed that the band were “gaslighting” him and telling him his performance was “sub-par” during the tour.\nMötley Crüe later issued their own response to Variety denouncing Mars’ “ugly, public” lawsuit. They included signed declarations from seven crew members about Mick Mars’ playing.\nIn a Planet Rock interview, Nikki Sixx also rubbished Mick Mars' claims, accusing him of being \"confused\" and \"misled\" over the lawsuit\nAlmost three years on, Mötley Crüe’s lawyers Miller Barondess LLP have released a press release stating the band have won the legal battle ‘resulting in a final arbitration award that rejects every claim Mars made against the band and orders him to pay damages back to the group.\n‘The arbitrator’s ruling not only vindicates the band contractually and financially but also dismantles the public narrative Mars promoted in interviews with major outlets.’\nThe statement continues: ‘The arbitrator, the Honourable Patrick Walsh (Ret.), ruled entirely in favour of Mötley Crüe, confirming that Mars forfeited any right to touring revenue when he chose to stop touring—a rule Mars himself demanded and wrote into the band’s governing agreement in 2008. That amendment explicitly provides that any member who stops touring does not share in touring income.\n‘Despite that agreement, Mars later demanded to continue receiving 25% of touring revenue in perpetuity while no longer performing. The arbitrator flatly rejected that position. The Final Award also upheld the band’s decision to terminate Mars as an officer and director for legal cause and ordered him to repay more than $750,000 in unrecouped tour advances. After accounting for the value of Mars’ shares, the final award results in a net judgment in favour of Mötley Crüe.\n‘But the case carries broader significance beyond band business disputes.\n‘While the arbitration was pending, Mars launched a public media campaign accusing the band of not playing live—claims he repeated under oath. Most notably, he asserted that Nikki Sixx’s bass and Tommy Lee’s drums were prerecorded, striking at the core of the band’s professional credibility.\n‘Those accusations collapsed under scrutiny. Faced with extensive live performance recordings—and testimony from his own retained expert, a New York University professor specializing in music technology—Mars was forced to admit under oath that his statements were false. His expert confirmed that the band performed live, and Mars formally recanted his prior claims during sworn testimony.’\nMötley Crüe’s lead counsel Sasha Frid of Miller Barondess, LLP, says: “This dispute was about protecting the integrity and legacy of one of the most successful bands in rock history. With the arbitrator rejecting every claim and enforcing the parties’ agreements as written, the band has been fully vindicated—legally, financially, and factually.”\nMick Mars is yet to comment on the legal result.\nRock bands that lied about farewell tours:\nSlayer\nFollowing a glorious 38-year career, Slayer's 147-date farewell tour concluded with thrash metal legends' (supposed) last-ever show at The Forum in Inglewood, California on 30th November 2019. However, just over four years later in February 2024, Slayer announced they were reuniting for two summer festival shows at Riot Fest Chicago and Aftershock festival in Sacramento, California. Guitarist Kerry King went on to warn fans not to expect a full-scale reunion, however we'll take that with a pinch of salt.\nMötley Crüe\nMötley Crüe were so adamant that their swansong Final Tour in 2014 and 2015 was definitely their farewell tour that all four members signed a cessation of touring agreement seemingly banning them from stepping on stage together again. The 'final' show took place at The Staples Centre in Mötley Crüe's native Los Angeles on 31st December 2015. Three years later, the band hit the studio to record four songs for their Netflix biopic The Dirt, but they still insisted they weren't touring. To no one's surprise, in November 2019 Mötley Crüe destroyed their cessation of touring agreement citing the \"huge success of The Dirt\", and they announced a North American stadium tour with Def Leppard, Poison and Joan Jett that finally happened in the summer of 2022. Mötley Crüe played a series of UK shows in 2023 on their co-headline tour with Def Leppard.\nTwisted Sister\nIn a 2017 interview a year after Twisted Sister's 'final' tour, Dee Snider: \"I'm one of those people who express great frustration at these bands who retire and then come back. I think it's an insult to the fans, especially when you pay a premium for those shows.\" He added: \"Me and the Twisted guys, we are of the mind, just like Mötley Crüe, that this really is it, and we're done. I have no intention of going back. I don't want to be one of those people who go back on their word, and I hope if I do, the audience tars and feathers me, and says, 'You know what? You're worse than the people who faked it. You made a big deal, made a stink, pointing fingers at everybody, and then you came back!' Lo and behold, in September 2025 Twisted Sister announced they were reuniting for a 50th anniversary world tour.\nStatus Quo\nBlighted by inter-band tensions, Status Quo embarked on the 10-week swansong End of the Road tour in 1984 with the so-called Farewell Concert taking place at Milton Keynes Bowl on 21st July. Francis Rossi told Classic Rock years later: \"Everybody was coked-up and hating each other and I'd started drinking tequila on that tour. I don't remember that show (in Milton Keynes) at all – the encores or anything; just falling flat on my back at one point.\" Continuing as a studio only band, Status Quo were coaxed into a live return by Bob Geldof when he asked them to open Live Aid at London's Wembley Stadium on 13th July 1985. Status Quo returned to live performances following that historic show, and, since Rick Parfitt's untimely passing in 2016, Francis Rossi continued under the Status Quo moniker until 2024.\nKISS\nFollowing the emphatic success of their Alive/Worldwide Tour and Psycho Circus World Tour with original members Peter Criss and Ace Frehley, KISS embarked on The Farewell Tour taking in shows in North America, Japan and Australia in 2000 and early 2001. Explaining KISS wanted to go out on a high, Paul Stanley said at the time: \"We're the champs again, let's retire on top and we felt there is nothing worse than having someone go away and you don't get to say goodbye so this tour really is for the fans and to celebrate the whole history of the band.\" KISS went on to perform at the closing ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and in 2003 they toured with Aerosmith with Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer added to their ranks. KISS concluded their second farewell tour in New York in December 2023. Will they reunite again? We wouldn't bet against it.\nThe Who\nThe Who played a farewell tour in North America in late 1982, with Roger Daltrey saying of touring life during a press conference: \"It's a nightmare. We can't get any bigger than we are… It's good to go out on top.\" John Entwistle was vehemently against The Who stopping touring, while Pete Townshend wanted The Who to become a studio band like The Beatles. The Who's 'last show' took place at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on 17th December, and their final USA gig at Richfield Coliseum in Cleveland, Ohio was immortalised with the 'Who's Last' live album. Just like Status Quo, The Who reformed for Live Aid in 1985 and four years later they reunited properly for a world tour.\nScorpions\nScorpions played a mammoth three-year farewell tour between 2010 and 2012 taking in more than 200 shows. However, Scorpions changed their mind about retiring from the road before the tour was even over. Singer Klaus Meine later explained the German hard rockers were having \"way too much fun\" to quit and said that playing for new generations of Scorpions fans was \"motivating and inspiring.\" Guitarist Matthias Jabs later said the decision to announce a farewell tour was \"stupid\", adding \"It's getting a bit ridiculous when you say (you're retiring from touring) and don't do it, so we won't do it again.\"\nJudas Priest\nIn December 2010, Judas Priest announced that their upcoming farewell Epitaph World Tour would be their last. Rob Halford explained: \"We're not the first band to say farewell, it's just the way everyone comes to at some point and we're gonna say a few more things early next year, so I think the main thing that we just want to ask everybody to consider is don't be sad about this, start celebrating and rejoicing over all the great things we've done in Judas Priest.\" K.K. Downing left Judas Priest before the start of the tour and their last concert took place at London's HMV Hammersmith Apollo on 26th May 2012. A year later, Halford said \"it's turned out not to be the final world tour\" and explained the band had \"got into gear again\" since they recruited Richie Faulkner. Judas Priest are still actively touring to this very day.\nNine Inch Nails\nIn 2009, Nine Inch Nails lynchpin Trent Reznor confirmed he's quitting touring. He told fans: \"NIN as a touring live band or live band that's on the road all the time is stopping. I've just reached the point where it has invaded every other aspect of my life. I'd never want to be Gene Simmons, an old man who puts on makeup to entertain kids, like a clown going to work. In my paranoia, I fear that if I don't stop this, it could become that.\" The final gig took place at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles on 10th September 2009. In 2013, Trent Reznor ended Nine Inch Nails' touring hiatus, saying: \"I'll catch some flak for saying I wasn't going to (tour) again, but I changed my mind. I feel much more invigorated and inspired than I did when I said I didn't want do it anymore.\"\nWhitesnake\nWhitesnake's autumn 1997 tour in support of their ninth studio album 'Restless Heart' was billed as a farewell trek, and it was given the brilliant moniker The Last Hurrah Tour. Five years later, David Coverdale announced plans to reform Whitesnake to celebrate the band's 25th anniversary in 2003. His new line-up consisted of drummer Tommy Aldridge, guitarists Doug Aldrich and Reb Beach, as well as bassist Marco Mendoza and keyboardist Timothy Drury.\nAerosmith\nIn late 2016, Aerosmith announced they were embarking on a trek the following year called the Aero-Vederci Baby! Tour – a play on the Italian word for goodbye, arrivederci. The tour took in 25 shows including a headline slot at Download Festival 2017. Prior to the tour's announcement, guitarist Brad Whitford told Billboard: \"We keep talking about what we may call a farewell tour, but based on the Kiss approach, that could go on for three to five years. We are seriously looking at that, just based on our age and everything.\" The tour ultimately didn't go on for several years – instead, Aerosmith played the Deuces are Wild residency in Las Vegas. Aerosmith retired from touring in August 2024.\nCream\nUnlike a number of rock acts on this list who changed their minds about retiring from the road shortly after their 'final' concerts, we have to give credit to Cream as they left it 37 years before coming back. Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker played two farewell gigs at London's Royal Albert Hall on 25th and 26th November 1968 with the second show released as the live video 'Farewell Concert.' The trio performed again at their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 1993 before reuniting properly for four concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in May 2005. Buoyed by the success of the RAH gigs, Cream played a three-night residency at Madison Square Garden in New York City in October 2005, however old tensions between the band resurfaced and they went their separate ways for good. Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker passed away in 2014 and 2019 respectively.\nThunder\nThunder embarked on their farewell tour in late 1999 and early 2000 before playing their last-ever show on 4th May at the Camden Dingwalls. The final gig was immortalised with the live album 'They Think It's All Over... It Is Now' that summer with the acoustic version 'They Think It's All Acoustic... It Is Now' following in May 2001. Thunder reformed for a series of November 2022 shows, and although Planet Rock's very own Danny Bowes insisted the reunion was \"non-permanent\", they remained active for over two decades.\nDavid Lee Roth\nBack in October 2021, former Van Halen vocalist David Lee Roth announced he was retiring for good once he completed a six-date Las Vegas residency in early 2022. \"I am throwing in the shoes. I'm retiring,\" Roth told reporters at the time. \"This is the first, and only, official announcement. … You've got the news. Share it with the world.\" The short run of Las Vegas concerts were eventually cancelled due to \"unforeseen circumstances\", however Roth came out of retirement in 2025 to announce his first concert in five years at the M3 Rock Festival in Maryland.\nOzzy Osbourne\nIn early 1992, the then 43-year-old Ozzy Osbourne said he was retiring from performing to spend more time with his family. He embarked on the 64-date No More Tours Tour in June 1992 and the trek concluded with two historic shows at Costa Mesa Pacific Ampitheatre on 14th and 15th November where Ozzy was joined by special guests Black Sabbath with Rob Halford on vocals. After Ozzy's set at the final concert, he reunited on stage with Black Sabbath to perform four songs – 'Black Sabbath', 'Fairies Wear Boots', 'Iron Man' and 'Paranoid.' What seemed like a fitting farewell for Ozzy ended just days later when he changed his mind and said he was \"already bored with retirement.\" Ozzy headed out on the brilliantly titled Retirement Sucks Tour in 1995. The late-great Ozzy announced his second farewell tour No More Tours II in 2018, however it was cancelled due to his series of health setbacks.\nMeat Loaf\nBack in 2013, the late-great Marvin Lee Aday – aka Meat Loaf – insisted that Last at Bat Tour in the UK and Europe would definitely be his swansong trek citing ill health. He told The Guardian: \"I've had 18 concussions. My balance is off. I've had a knee replacement. I've got to have the other one replaced. Two weeks before the knee surgery, I literally couldn't walk from the bedroom to the kitchen. They took me to the hospital in an ambulance to get my knee replaced. And when they did, it was so damaged and torn up it's going to take a year to come back. It's just the travel. It takes it out of you. I want to concentrate more on acting. That's where I started and that's where I'll finish. This time, they're not going to rope me back in.\" Meat Loaf went on to play over 30 shows in North America in 2015 and 2016, however due to his deteriorating health he finally stepped back from live shows. His last live performance was on the Huckabee TV show in the US in September 2021, where he performed 3 songs in front of a live audience. Sadly he passed away just 4 months later.",
