  "text": "Save During Penguin Days at the Cincinnati Zoo\nEnjoy un-brrr-lievable discounts January 8 – March 8\nCINCINNATI, OH (January 5, 2024) — March to the Cincinnati Zoo during\nPenguin Days, presented by U.S. Bank, at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden! Visitors will enjoy deeply discounted Zoo admission January 8 through March 8 and can see Penguin Parades Saturdays and Sundays at 11 a.m. (and holiday Mondays) through the end of February. This will be the last year for these parades, so don’t miss your last chance to see king penguins waddle through the Zoo.\n“I’m sad to see the Penguin Parades end, but our flock is aging and ready to retire. Marching has always been voluntary, and the birds that consistently want to walk will still do so this year,” said Cincinnati Zoo director Thane Maynard.\nIn addition to Penguin Parades, there will be\nspecial animal encounters on the weekends. Learn more about otters, insects, wolves, keas, and African painted dogs from the keepers that care for them.\n“There’s still a lot to do and see at the Zoo on cold days, and the discounted admission makes a winter visit even more attractive,” said Maynard. “I could spend all day in the award-winning World of the Insect!”\nOther indoor habitats include Birds of the World, Manatee Springs, Night Hunters, Jungle Trails, Reptile House, Dragons, and Discovery Forest. Gorillas are viewable in their indoor habitat, and the world-famous hippos will be out if temps are above 40 degrees.\nIf you’re still feeling festive,\nPNC Festival of Lights runs through January 7. The Cincinnati Zoo opens daily at 10 a.m. Starting Monday, closing time will be 5 p.m. For more information, visit http://cincinnatizoo.org/.",
