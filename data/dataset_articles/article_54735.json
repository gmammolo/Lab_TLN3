Sign in with Google Continue with Facebook Login using other methods The narrative of Eileen centers around the titular character, a young woman whose life is a monotonous cycle of caring for her alcoholic father and working at a juvenile prison. However, her existence is upended by the arrival of a psychologist named Rebecca in the prison. With Rebecca's entry, Eileen's life takes an unprecedented turn.\nDisclaimer: The article contains major spoilers from the movie.\nNotably, the movie is a dark and thrilling adaptation of Ottessa Moshfegh's book with the same title, and has commendable performances by Anne Hathaway as Rebecca and Thomas McKenzie as Eileen. However, as it delves into the complexities of its characters and setting, it contains some tonal inconsistencies.\nHow Eileen culminates as a twisted psychological thriller\nView this post on Instagram Instagram Post\nThere is a significant tonal shift in the third act of the movie that disrupts its coherence. This shift results in Rebecca's character becoming less credible as her portrayal isn't quite consistent. Although Hathaway's acting is compelling, the change in tone affects her character and diminishes the audience's engagement with the story.\nFurthermore, the film's use of a small-town setting, muted color palette, and stark landscapes visually aids the storytelling. The depiction not only sets the tone of the film but also mirrors the internal states of the characters.\nNotably, the movie is based on the book by Ottessa Moshfegh of the same name. Speaking of which, William Oldroyd, the director of Eileen , does a meticulous job of navigating moral gray areas and creating a suspenseful and unsettling atmosphere as described in the book.\nThrough his direction, he has effectively executed the film as a journey through various character studies as it culminates in a deeply twisted psychological thriller . Moreover, the narrative also explores the themes of secrets, lies, and liberation as elucidated in the book.",
