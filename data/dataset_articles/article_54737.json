  "text": "Screambox\n“The Dead Hour” – Binge the First Season of Terror Films’ Anthology Series on SCREAMBOX!\nFans of Terror Films (The Taking of Deborah Logan, Savageland, and the Hell House LLC films) get ready for a full three seasons of their binge-worthy anthology series “The Dead Hour”, which will be unloading over the next few weeks.\nEach episode features a mysterious late-night radio host (Melissa Holder) who delves into different horrifying tales each episode.\nThe first season is streaming right now on\nSCREAMBOX with a new season landing each Friday.\n“The Dead Hour”, created by Daniel B. Iske & Scott Coleman, was inspired by “The Twilight Zone”, and stars Melissa Holder, Mark Booker, Cheri Bloomingdale, Aleksey Solodov, Nic Roewert, Peris Stapleton, Wendy Iske, Gina Cederberg, Sabrina Kinney, Mandy Barkurst, and Jordin Fitch.\nCheck out the trailer below.\nIf you are new to SCREAMBOX, welcome!

Slasher’ Celebrates Tabloid Culture on SCREAMBOX [Trailer]\nA cultural crusader strikes in L.A. Slasher, now\nstreaming on SCREAMBOX.\nDirected by Martin Owen and produced by Jeffrey Wright and Daniel Sollinger (Girls Against Boys, The Alphabet Killer), the black comedy stars Mischa Barton (“The O.C.”), Eric Roberts (The Dark Knight), Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy), Danny Trejo (Machete), and comedian Andy Dick as the voice of the killer.\nL.A. Slasher is “a biting, social satire about reality TV and the glorification of people who are famous for simply being famous.”\nThe film also “explores why it has become acceptable and even admirable for people to become influential and wealthy based on no merit or talent – purely through notoriety achieved through shameful behavior.\n“Incensed by the tabloid culture which celebrates it, the L.A. Slasher publicly abducts a series of reality TV stars, while the media and general public in turn begin to question if society is better off without them.”\nHere’s the trailer.",
