  "text": "Did you know the camellia is Alabama’s official State Flower? And did you know that the Dothan Area Botanical Garden has over 80 different camellias in its Camellia Garden? And finally, did you know that Dothan was once well-known in the world of camellia enthusiasts? In celebration of Camellia Day in Alabama, DABG is hosting several workshops on Saturday, Jan. 13, to introduce you to what some refer to as the “Winter Rose” due to its blooming season during winter months. The morning workshop will be led by local camellia expert Dr. Max McKinney who will cover all the basics of growing camellias in his presentation “Getting Started with Camellias”. McKinney tends over 1,700 camellias and has over 1,000 varieties on his farm near Webb. He is frequently asked to judge camellia shows and is considered a true authority on this wonderful plant. Another morning workshop will be a demonstration on waxing camellias. Waxing is an excellent way to preserve camellia blooms and gives them a porcelain-like shine that lasts for many days, and sometimes weeks. Once waxed, they do not need a vase or water—they can simply be displayed on a plate or by themselves on a table. Participants are welcome to bring a bloom of their own to wax or select from the blooms provided. People are also reading… After lunch, Forrest Latta from Mobile will present an interesting talk called “Dothan’s Rich Camellia Heritage.” Forrest is a native of Dothan and serves as the Alabama State Director of the Alabama Camellia Society. He has written articles for garden publications including a book entitled Camellia Garden Field Guide (Amazon Press). He also serves on the Board of Trustees of Troy University. Caitlyn Clark, horticulturist at DABG will lead the waxing demonstration and lead tours of the DABG Camellia Garden after lunch and again at the end of the day, at approximately 2:30. A variety of camellias will be available for sale during the workshop. Cost of the workshop is $30 which includes a box lunch. Spaces are limited. Please register online by visiting the DABG website at [www.dabg.com](http://www.dabg.com) or by calling the Gardens Office at (334)-793-3224. Deadline for registration is Jan. 10.",
