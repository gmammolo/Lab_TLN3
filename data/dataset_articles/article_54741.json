  "text": "Yahoo Finance AU 7 easy money resolutions to change your life - not just your 2024 Forget the gym, here are Nicole's key financial 'cheat' codes. Read full article Nicole Pedersen-McKinnon · Contributor Updated 5 January 2024 at 11:50 pm · 4-min read\nIn a fresh new year , you’re probably thinking along the lines of eating less, spending less, exercising more, saving money , etcetera. But there is a far simpler way to start the new year right.\nI wouldn’t call mine the cheat’s way but, year in, year out, I see people working far too hard rather than working the money system. In other words, they don’t take advantage of all the free economic kicks out there.\nHere are the seven ways to get an easy money edge in the next year and beyond.\nNicole Pedersen-McKinnon saved money by using cash for any discretionary spending for three months. ( Source: Supplied/Getty ) Easy money resolution 7: Start paying your mortgage fortnightly Whatever you do, don’t go to the bank and ask to pay fortnightly – they’ll sabotage your savings. Simply make half your monthly minimum, each fortnight. I won’t bore you with why, but this will put you a whole month ahead every year. On a $400,000 mortgage at an average 5 per cent interest rate, you’ll save $48,000 and 3.5 years.\nAlso by Nicole Pedersen-McKinnon :\n55 days or more: The credit cards with the longest interest-free periods\nRBA hikes again: Is it time to lock in your home loan?\nSimple tax hack that could save you $540\nEasy money resolution 6: Stop paying money directly INTO your mortgage By doing this you’re running the risk that those extra payments will be subsumed - as in, locked away from you if you need them. The only safe way is to make over-and-above repayments into a parallel offset account. Your interest saving is the same.\nEasy money resolution 5: ‘Load’ your expenses onto a 55-day interest-free credit card There are two reasons to do this:\nYou can sit your salary in an offset account beside your mortgage for the month so it slashes your interest\nYou can turn your expenses into powerful points because who's in a position to pay a fortune for travel right now?\nOf course, pay the interest-free credit card off in full - from the offset account - at the end of every month.\nEasy money resolution 4: Refuse to pay credit card interest There is no need for this. The dirty little secret of the banking world is that the average credit card still charges 17 per cent interest while the best is 7.49 per cent. But you shouldn’t even be paying that - if you carry over some debt (the idea is to clear the card above every month from your offset account), you need to park it at 0 per cent interest, which is still available for up to 32 months .\nStory continues Easy money resolution 3: Think of ‘future you’ and put free money into your super every year If you are in a couple and one person earns less than $40,000, you should be paying $3,000 each year into their super - it will get you a $540 tax offset, which means a tax discount.\nIf you're working but earn less than $58,445, paying in just $19.25 a week could score you a free cash boost to your super of up to $500, which - if done every year - could boost your end balance by $185,019 (for 30-year-olds). Or you could let the government keep all this money.\nEasy money resolution 2: Consider going to cash for your FUN stuff I did this for the first three months of 2023 and cut my discretionary spend by 35 per cent. Do it before the currency goes completely digital and watch what happens - just the inconvenience might see you save.\nEasy money resolution 1: Get private health If you earn more than $93,000 a year as a single, or $186,000 as a couple, get private health. You’re paying for it anyway in the form of the Medicare Levy Surcharge, a tax penalty of as much as 1.5 per cent - it’s $930 on $93,000. So get medical coverage.\nFinally, know that a mortgage refinance today saves an instant average $618 per month .\nIn 2024, make life EASIER!\nNicole Pedersen-McKinnon is the author of How to Get Mortgage-Free Like Me, available at www.nicolessmartmoney.com .
