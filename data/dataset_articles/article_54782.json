  "text": "In November 2023, Spain’s tourism industry reached a remarkable milestone, welcoming 5.1 million international tourists, marking an 18.6% increase compared to the same month in 2022. This significant growth not only highlights Spain’s enduring appeal as a top travel destination but also signals a strong recovery and resurgence of the global tourism sector. The increase in tourist numbers is a testament to Spain’s diverse attractions, from its sun-soaked beaches to rich cultural heritage, appealing to a wide range of travelers. The United Kingdom led the surge, contributing over 1.0 million tourists, a 15.2% increase from November 2022. France and Germany followed closely, with 0.6 million arrivals each, showcasing an increase of 9.0% and 18.5%, respectively. This upward trend in tourism was not limited to November alone. The first 11 months of 2023 saw an 18.2% increase in tourist visits, with the total number exceeding 79.8 million. This figure even surpassed the pre-pandemic levels of 2019 by 0.8%, indicating a robust recovery and a positive outlook for Spain’s tourism industry. The type of accommodations chosen by these tourists also varied, with a notable preference for market accommodations. Hotel accommodations grew by 13.8%, while rented dwellings saw a significant increase of 39.5%. Non-market accommodations, including vacation home ownership and staying with family or friends, also saw an increase, highlighting the diverse preferences of international travelers. The length of stay for these tourists varied, with a majority opting for four to seven nights, reflecting the typical vacation duration. The number of tourists traveling without a package tour also increased, indicating a trend towards more independent and personalized travel experiences. Spain’s main tourist destinations during this period included the Canary Islands, Catalonia, and Andalusia. The Canary Islands, known for their beautiful landscapes and pleasant climate, received 12.4% more tourists than in November 2022. Catalonia and Andalusia also saw significant increases in tourist numbers, by 19.7% and 21.5%, respectively. The data, which is provisional and subject to revision, is part of the Tourist Movement on Borders Survey (FRONTUR). This survey aims to estimate the number of non-residents visiting Spain and to understand the main characteristics of their trips. The methodology adheres to international definitions and recommendations, ensuring accurate and reliable data. Spain’s tourism sector’s performance in November 2023 is a clear indicator of the country’s enduring appeal and its ability to adapt and thrive in a changing global landscape. The increase in tourist numbers not only boosts the economy but also reinforces Spain’s position as a leading global tourist destination. As the world continues to navigate the post-pandemic era, Spain’s tourism success story offers hope and inspiration. It demonstrates the resilience of the travel industry and the enduring appeal of cultural and natural attractions. With its diverse offerings and welcoming atmosphere, Spain continues to captivate the hearts of travelers from around the world.",
