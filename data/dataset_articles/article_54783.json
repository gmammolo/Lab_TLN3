  "text": "Moose Knuckles Drops Mystical Lunar New Year Capsule\nWith a bounty of comfort-first silhouettes inspired by the Year of the Dragon.\nAhead of the Chinese\nLunar New Year, Canadian outerwear label Moose Knuckles has pulled back the curtain on a symbolic capsule collection celebrating the Year of the Dragon.\nThe label invited graphic artist Panda Mei, fashion stylist Yuky and “hype blogger” MoO$E to join forces on creating the line’s campaign, dubbed “RISE OF THE DRAGON.” Each creative appears in the visual, expressing their own interpretations of the dragon’s likeness and sharing their hopes for the new year.\nThe collection itself, which includes an abundance of warm silhouettes, centers around the zodiac sign of the dragon, too. “As a noble and enigmatic creature, the dragon symbolizes power, wisdom, and good fortune, featuring prominently in a vast array of Chinese mythology, historical legends, and art,” Moose Knuckles wrote in a statement. Notably, Panda possesses a “profound understanding of the dragon’s significance,” which he illustrates through his smooth depictions of the mythical creature in the visuals.\nThe collection’s iconography, which fuses that of Moose Knuckles with the traditional Chinese dragon motif, lands on a number of vivid pieces, including print-covered jackets, crewneck sweaters, hoodies, T-shirts, bottoms and headwear. Among the standouts, the hoodies and sweatpants are reversible, with one side flashing a scale-inspired design and the other finished in black with the dragon logo.\nMoose Knuckles’ Lunar New Year capsule collection is now available to shop\nonline and in the brand’s stores. Take a closer look at the range in the gallery above.",
