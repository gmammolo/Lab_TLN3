  "text": "On Jan. 2, Malbon Golf announced the signing of its first PGA Tour ambassador, Jason Day . The Aussie had been with Nike since 2016, but Day left the checkmark behind as the calendar flipped to 2024.\nMalbon is a popular brand deeply embedded into the game of golf and strives to connect with the younger generation. One thing is certain — Malbon will bring lots of style to the Tour with its new deal with Day.\nIn December, the former world No. 1 teamed up with Lydia Ko to win the inaugural Grant Thornton Invitational. Well, his good form made the trip with him to Hawaii as he posted an 8-under 65 Thursday to hold a share of second after the opening round of The Sentry at Kapalua’s Plantation Course.\nThursday was also Day’s first competitive round rocking his new Malbon threads. Take a look at some photos of Day’s new look below.\nThe Sentry : Photo gallery\n2024 The Sentry Jason Day plays his shot from the sixth tee during the second round of the 2024… Jason Day plays his shot from the sixth tee during the second round of the 2024 Sentry at Plantation Course at Kapalua Golf Club in Kapalua, Hawaii.
