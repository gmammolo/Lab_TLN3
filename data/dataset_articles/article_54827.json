  "text": "Pizza chefs break Guinness World Record for using 1,001 varieties of cheese on one Italian staple. Pizza chefs break Guinness World Record for using 1,001 varieties of cheese on one Italian staple The French pizza chefs, Benoit Bruel and Fabien Montellanico, recently made headlines by breaking a Guinness World Record for creating a pizza with the most variety of cheeses. The pizza was topped with a whopping 1,001 types of cheese, surpassing the previous record of 834 cheese types from 2021. Breaking the Record Bruel and Montellanico meticulously placed two-gram cubes of each cheese flavor on the pizza, with the softer cheeses layered on top of the hard cheeses. They had to pre-cook the pizza dough to prevent it from tearing up under the weight of all the cheese, and a cookie cutter was used to hold everything together while it cooked. Dreams and Achievements Bruel, who has been a pizza maker for 13 years, expressed his excitement at breaking the record again and fulfilling his dream of making pizzas with the widest variety of cheeses. He also shared that many cheesemakers offered him free cheese to be incorporated into his record-breaking attempts. Photo Credit: a57.foxnews.com",
