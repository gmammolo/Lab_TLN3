  "text": "The Traitors fans were left in hysterics as clairvoyant Tracey got Anthony’s star sign wrong.\nA clairvoyant is a person who claims to have a supernatural ability to perceive events in the future or beyond normal sensory contact.\nAnd during episode three, Tracey was using her ability during a reading with contestant Anthony – but guessed his star sign wrong.\nBBC viewers found the moment hilarious, with one penning on X: ‘Oh well! Tracey just shown herself up by getting Anthony’s star sign wrong’\nAnother wrote: ‘Tracey on the Traitors spouting vague generalisations that would apply to the majority of people. But that’s what clairvoyants do’\nThe Traitors fans were left in hysterics as clairvoyant Tracey got Anthony’s star sign wrong\nDuring episode three, Tracey was using her ability during a reading with contestant Anthony – but guessed his star sign wrong\nTracey, 58, from Inverness, who is also a Snographer, says she is ‘quite eccentric’ and ‘good at lying’.\nTracey, who used to be in the air force, said: ‘The only thing that would be my downfall is that I do really like to be liked.’\nOn the possibility of being a Traitor, she said: ‘I think I’ll be terrified, just terrified. Although you’ve got to go with whatever opportunity life gives you.\n‘If I’m going to be a Traitor, then I will embrace it 100%. You’re going to get close to people really quickly.\n‘I used to go on detachment with people in the military, and they’d be like your best friend for two whole weeks, you couldn’t possibly ever live without them and then when you get home, you never contact each other again.’\nOn what strengths she’d bring to the show’s missions, she said: ‘I used to be in the Air Force and that’s the bit that I miss.\n‘Doing the mad exercises and jumping out of helicopters and being winched into the sea.\n‘I love doing crosswords and playing board games. I love doing treasure trails, I just love anything like that.\n‘I don’t know if I’m a natural leader or I’m bossy, I’m not sure what the difference is.\n‘I think I’ll be kind of gathering everybody up and getting us to work as a team, I hope.’\nA clairvoyant is a person who claims to have a supernatural ability to perceive events in the future or beyond normal sensory contact\nBBC viewers found the moment hilarious, with one penning on X: ‘Oh well! Tracey just shown herself up by getting Anthony’s star sign wrong’\nThe Traitors sees 22 strangers are playing the ultimate game of detection, backstabbing and trust, in the hope of winning up to £120,000.\nIn the show, the majority of contestants are Faithfuls and must work out who amongst them are Traitors – who have the opportunity to ‘murder’ a fellow contestant each night.\nThe group has daily ‘banishments’ in which they must vote to kick out who they think is a Traitor, all while working together on challenges to raise money for the prize fund.\nIn addition, the contestants compete in various ‘missions’, which up until now have had the aim of increasing the prize pot, but this year, can also see the group win ‘shields’ guarding them from murder for one day.\n***\nRead more at DailyMail.co.uk",
