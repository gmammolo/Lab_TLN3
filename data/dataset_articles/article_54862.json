She was an office manager, who became a home manager for many years as she raised her four children. My father was Tony Baker. He was a company representative for a large paper company and later became a newspaper and printing company manager. What is the best/worst advice your dad (or mum) gave you? In my experience, most advice is both good and bad. Advice from my mother: But they did not prepare me for moving into a large vegetarian house (with 20 residents) and I had to switch to lentils. I stopped eating meat and have never eaten it again, though I still like the smell of sausages cooking on the barbecue. Advice from my father: Never buy an old car and always buy Japanese. I did the opposite and bought a series of old cars including a 1957 Nash Metropolitan convertible, an early 1960s Citroen Safari, a 1965 Ford Falcon Futura, and later a 1990 Saab 900. My father was right. All these cars were expensive disasters, but I loved driving them during the rare moments that they were running smoothly. Now I ride a bicycle and life is better, though I could not part with my old Nash Metropolitan which I have kept in storage.",
