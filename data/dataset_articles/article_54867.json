  "text": "One of the rare ‘ [Alfa Romeo](https://www.carscoops.com/tag/alfa-romeo/) Racing’ variants of the potent Giulia Quadrifoglio is heading to auction on January 31 and if pre-auction estimates prove to be accurate, it will sell for between €70,000 (~$76,000) and €90,000 (~$98,000). While [the Giulia Quadrifoglio](https://www.carscoops.com/2023/12/dealer-mechanic-crashes-alfa-giulia-qv-onto-porsche-911-into-mercedes-during-test-drive/) has never sold in the same numbers as the likes of the [BMW](https://www.carscoops.com/tag/BMW/) M3 and Mercedes-AMG C 63, it remains a very impressive high-performance sports sedan and of all the versions introduced, the Alfa Romeo Racing model is one of the most eye-catching. Sure, it is no GTAm, but it is significantly rarer. [The car](https://www.carscoops.com/tag/alfa-romeo-giulia/) was introduced to celebrate Alfa Romeo’s return to the Formula 1 grid and capped at just 10 units worldwide. Alfa Romeo also built 10 examples of the Stelvio Quadrifoglio in the same configuration. This car, like all others, has a white and red paint scheme similar to the C38 that competed during the 2019 F1 season. The hood of the limited-run model is particularly dramatic with bright red racing stripes, blue accents, and a large Alfa Romeo logo in the center. advertisement scroll to continue Read: [Alfa Romeo Giulia And Stelvio QV Racing Editions Reflect Bond With F1](https://www.carscoops.com/2019/03/alfa-romeo-giulia-and-stelvio-qv-racing-editions-reflect-bond-with-f1/) [](https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alfa-Romeo-Giulia-Quadrifoglio-15.jpg) Alfa Romeo also went to the trouble of equipping the car with a handful of carbon fiber accessories, including canards on the front bumper and carbon fiber elements on the rocker panels. There is also a carbon fiber lip spoiler at the rear. Various performance upgrades were also made to the car. The most obvious is the fitment of an Akrapovic titanium exhaust system but there are also carbon-ceramic brakes and tweaks made to the 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V6 so it now delivers 512 hp, a 10 hp gain over the regular Giulia Quadrifoglio. It also weighs 28 kg (61 lbs) less, not that drivers will notice the difference. [RM Sotheby’s](https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/PA24/Paris/lots/r0056-2020-Alfa-Romeo-Giulia-Quadrifoglio-Alfa-Romeo-Racing-Edition/) notes that this example has been driven 5,990 km (3,722 miles) since new.",
