Elder Mother is a monumental shade-bearing tree that moves in the wind. The 30-ft metal sculpted tree carries a 25-ft canopy offering a place for park-goers to gather day and night with ever-changing illumination and color. Eldermother also incorporates six unique QR codes on the tree ‘leaves’ which allow attendees to control the tree’s lighting patterns.\nJoin the SF Public Library for story time under the tree! The YouthMobile will also make an appearance, with a selection of children’s literary materials.\nJanuary 6 & 13, 2024 – 1-6p\n“The YouthMobile offers a diverse selection of children’s library materials available for check-out with an SFPL library card. From the City’s only kid-focused bookmobile, we circulate materials, create library cards and provide the public with information about library services and programs. Come aboard and see what we have!”\nDisclaimer: Please double check event information with the event organizer as events can be canceled, details can change after they are added to our calendar, and errors do occur.\nCategories:\n*Top Pick*, In Person, Kids & Families, Nature, Outdoors [< Friday, January 5](/2024/01/05/) [Sunday, January 7 >](/2024/01/07/)",
