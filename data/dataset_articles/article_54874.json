  "text": "One Direction star Louis Tomlinson's 19-year-old sister Phoebe has become a mother after welcoming a baby girl with her partner Jack Varley.\nIn a beautiful reel, Phoebe, an influencer with over a million followers, shared the heartwarming moment her little girl came into the world.\nToday's top videos\nThe clip which was shot in black and white skipped through her water birth with intimate scenes from her labour. At one point the camera pans out to a shot of a baby romper hanging in the room before quickly jumping to the moment when Phoebe tearfully cradled her baby for the first time.\nLouis Tomlinson's sister has become a mum after welcoming a baby girl. Pic: Phoebe Tomlinson Instagram As the little girl was handed to her, Barton Town footballer Jack, whom she began dating in 2022, leaned in for a sweet kiss.\nCue more adorable shots of the baby wrapped up in a little hat and boots squirming about in her incubator and their little home movie ends with Phoebe crying as holds her.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by PHOEBE ROSE TOMLINSON (@thephoebetomlinson)\nAs well as the intimate video, Phoebe also shared her daughter's beautiful name which pays tribute to her late mother. She and Jack have named the little girl Olive, which is associated with peace, while her middle name is Johannah after Phoebe and Louis' late mum.\nJohannah passed away at just 43 years of age in 2016 from leukemia and it looks like her memory will live on her granddaughter. The family also tragically lost their sister Félicité in 2019 who passed away from an accidental overdose.\nPhoebe Tomlinson and her boyfriend Jack. Pic: Phoebe Tomlinson / Instagram According to Phoebe, Olive was a very healthy 7lb 7oz when she was born and congratulations have been pouring in from her family and legions of followers. Her dad Mark wrote: 'Way, way beyond proud, so begins the best journey in life ever.'\n'Congratulations Phoebe, she's scrumptious and I love the name and its significance to you too. Enjoy these precious moments,' posted someone else.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by PHOEBE ROSE TOMLINSON (@thephoebetomlinson)\nWhen the couple announced they were expecting in June they had thought they were having a baby boy but found out at their 20-week scan that they were actually having a girl. Phoebe said in August: 'After a few days of processing it, we’re ready to tell you all that at our 20-week scan we found out you’re a little girl, we’re so excited to meet you.'\nCongratulations, Phoebe and Jack!",
