  "text": "There are a ton of great products that drop every week — and we’re here, as always, to keep you up to date on the best of them. Each week, we’ll be rounding up a short list of our favorite product drops from the last seven days for you to shop as you sip your morning coffee or take a quick break from work (trust, it’s the only list you need for staying up to date on these things).\nThis week brings the launch of Beast ’s stylish mini blender, a new sports collection from Draper James and Ikea ’s double launch of an at-home workout equipment line and retro-inspired collection. Shop our favorite new releases below, but be fast — they’re prone to selling out.\nDraper James Sport Activewear in florals and yes, gingham\nDraper James Reese Witherspoon’s lifestyle brand, Draper James, has just come out with a Sport collection — and if you’re sick of black and other utilitarian colorways and patterns on your workout apparel, this might just be your line. It also has styles just for golf, tennis and pickleball. There are $65 sports bras in floral prints , $75 white cropped sport tops that can go from pilates to brunch, a super-chic $125 wrap tennis dress you’ll definitely want to wear off the court and of course, gingham everything.\nBriogeo Scalp Revival Rosemary Pre-Wash Oil A before-shampoo oil to strengthen and moisturize\nBriogeo If winter weather has your hair stressed and dried-out, Briogeo’s new $32 pre-wash oil is here to help get your strands soft and smooth again. It’s made for all hair types and textures: Just part your hair and apply it right to a dry scalp and hair, then massage it in and leave it on for at least 10 minutes (or even overnight) before rinsing and following with your usual shampoo and conditioner. The result? A less-itchy scalp and silky hair.\nIkea Dajlien Sports Collection and 80th Anniversary Collection Two exciting drops from the go-to home retailer\nIkea Ikea is starting off the new year in a big way with not one, but two great drops. First up is the first-ever sports collection from the Swedish home retailer, and it’s the kind of well-designed, practical workout equipment you won’t mind displaying in your home — plus it starts at $4. Think a stylish circular weight set, sports towels, a bamboo step board, a training bench that also doubles as storage and a compact air purifier for when you really work up a sweat.\nNext up is the third drop from Ikea’s 80th-anniversary collection, Nytellverkad , which features reimagined versions of bestsellers from the ’60s and ’70s, featuring bold green, yellow and blue. Expect a low-slung $100 wire armchair , a bright red wheeled side table for $50 and an $80 shag rug to give texture to your indoor spaces.\nBeast Mini Blender A chic machine for mornings on the go\nBeast Beast’s actually-stylish blender now comes in a mini size, perfect for people living alone who don’t want to dirty a super-size blender every time they whip up a smoothie, batch of hummus or frozen marg. The $99 appliance has a 21.5-ounce vessel and comes with everything you need to get going (and clean up). There’s also an upgraded Plus version for $119 that comes with two more vessels in smaller sizes.\nYouth to the People Body Care A high-performing line of body care inspired by skincare\nYouth to the People Youth to the People’s new Body Care Collection is the kind of product line that’ll make you look forward to 6 a.m. showers. It’s packed with actual skincare ingredients (like niacinamide) so that you treat the rest of your body as well as you do your face. There’s a $39 body cleanser (it comes in a 16.4-ounce bottle that’ll last you awhile) that smells incredible, plus a high-performing, $42 10% AHA + Yerba Mate Smoothing Energy Body Scrub that really helped this writer’s keratosis pilaris. Finally, there’s a $48 body butter for 48 hours of brightening, firming and hydration for your skin, thanks to “Superberry Antioxidant Extracts” and some cupuacu butter for a huge dose of moisture.\nMade In Non-Stick Pans Limited-Edition Colorways Pro-level pans with metallic pops of color\nMatt Conant/Made In If your New Year’s resolution is to get in the kitchen more, Made In’s pro-level pans now come in two new limited-edition colors that’ll make you excited to start cooking. The nontoxic finish is perfect for helping reduce the amount of cooking oil you use, and they clean up like a treat, too. If you don’t love bright colors, these are the pans for you: There’s a chic brushed “Silver Lake” colorway and a fun “Frozen Berry” colorway that has a metallic bordeaux finish on the interior.\nDr. Dennis Gross Perfectly Dosed Retinol Treatments A starting point for the retinol-curious\nDr. Dennis Gross If you’re new to retinol , it’s hard to know where to start. That’s where Dr. Dennis Gross’ new pre-dosed treatments come in. Beginners can kick off with the $42 universal edition of Advanced Retinol + Ferulic Perfectly Dosed Retinol Universal 0.2% Treatment , treatment pads that you swipe on overnight for a precise delivery of liquid retinol, bakuchiol and rambutan — and the addition of squalane, hyaluronic acid and ferulic acid are there too to help your skin stays hydrated. Prefer a little more retinol? There’s a $42 .5% advanced formulation too , perfect for those whose skin is already used to the ingredient.\nRuggable x Jeneva Bell Founder’s Collection The president of Ruggable designs her own line\nRuggable Ruggable ’s machine-washable rugs have a new look courtesy of the company’s own president, Jeneva Bell. She’s just launched her own Founder’s Collection, with 22 pieces that feature some of her favorite aesthetics: dark academia, Spanish revival and European farmhouse. Tones are rich — think deep burgundy and olive — and come in Persian and Heritage styles that go with a ton of types of decor.\nAnastasia Beverly Hills Lip Velvet and Brow Freeze Gel New year, new brows (and lip colors!)\nAnastasia Beverly Hills A matte liquid lipstick that goes on easily and doesn’t wear off? Here for it. Anastasia Beverly Hills’ newest $24 “lip mousse” gives you a ton of color and a weightless finish that doesn’t dry out your lips. There’s a full range of on-trend nude shades: Kiss (rose petal), Crush (soft taupe), Peachy Nude (self-explanatory), Peach Amber (a deep peach), Pure Hollywood (a pale mauve nude) and Parchment (a peachy brown).\nBut the company is known for its brow products, and a new one joins the family with the introduction of the $26 Brow Freeze Gel, a clear wax-gel hybrid that pairs with a comb applicator so brows brush down smooth — and, most importantly stay down.",
