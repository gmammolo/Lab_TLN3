  "text": "CG writes: Developer Praydog has worked tirelessly to convert Capcom games to VR (some with full motion controls too) with his REFramework mod, and has been beavering away at an Unreal Engine VR mod for quite some time. What is interesting about this is the fact there are 1000s of Unreal Engine games to choose from which opens up the VR library considerably (best results with UE 4/5 games). Unlike people such as LukeRoss who unashamedly charge a premium for his AER Real VR mod where you have to keep paying more if any of the games become broken due to game updates, Praydog offers his efforts FREE-OF-CHARGE, which is why gamers should toss a donation his way via the Patreon page if they are able to. Here's a list of eight amazing indie merch sites that will allow you to find exactly what you are looking for, and probably a few more extras on top of that. A ghost from Cloud's past plays a larger role in the middle act of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy. Don't be surprirsed if Zack ends up being a bad guy at some point over a misunderstanding after certain story events. Yoshinori Kitase, Tetsuya Nomura, and Naoki Hamaguchi are extremely excited about a certain encounter in Corel Prison.",
