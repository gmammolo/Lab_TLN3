  "text": "Brentford vs Wolverhampton Wanderers. The FA Cup Third Round.\nGtech Community StadiumAttendance16,818.\nReport as Doyle's strike from outside the box cancels out Neal Maupay's opener following Gomes's early red for injuring Christian Norgaard; FA Cup Fourth Round draw on Monday from 7.50pm\n 22:07, UK\nA rocket from Tommy Doyle kept Wolves in the FA Cup despite playing with 10 players for 81 minutes at Brentford.\nWolves lost Joao Gomes to an early red card and were trailing to Neal Maupay's first-half goal when Doyle struck from 20 yards to secure a 1-1 draw and a replay.\nIn a niggly encounter, Gomes was given his marching orders for chopping down Bees captain Christian Norgaard.\nBut Wolves could easily point to a similar challenge from Mikkel Damsgaard on Doyle which went unpunished.\nBrentford were looking for a measure of revenge for the 4-1 defeat they were dealt by the same opposition in the Premier League nine days earlier.\nThey suffered a collective defensive meltdown in that loss and the nerves were hardly settled when goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha, making only his third appearance of the season, passed the ball straight to Wolves forward Matheus Cunha.\nThe Brazilian managed to round Strakosha but ran into defender Mathias Jorgensen, who cleared the ball over his own crossbar.\nMoments later Wolves found themselves a player light after Gomes caught Norgaard on the heel with his studs and was shown a straight red card by referee Tony Harrington.\nIt was a further injury blow for already-depleted Brentford with Denmark midfielder Norgaard unable to continue.\nFormer Wolves defender Nathan Collins, who was directly culpable for two of his old side's goals in last week's horror show, almost made amends at the right end of the pitch with a shot which curled narrowly over.\nThen Bees midfielder Josh Dasilva, making his first appearance since suffering a hamstring injury in August, tested Wanderers keeper Jose Sa with a low, skidding drive before the hosts went ahead five minutes before half-time.\nAfter Wolves failed to clear a Mathias Jensen free-kick, the ball ricocheted to the feet of Maupay who rifled it home from eight yards for his third goal of the season.\nAfter the break Damsgaard's shot was well blocked by Sa and Dasilva hit the side-netting before, almost out of nowhere, Wolves equalised.\nA short corner was worked by Pedro Neto to Doyle on the edge of the area, with the England U21 midfielder taking a touch before lashing the ball left-footed into the top corner.\nIt was Doyle's first goal for Wolves and he had a taste for more, only this time he cracked another drive straight into the face of Jensen, who had to go off after a concussion check.\nBrentford could have won it late on but substitute Myles Peart-Harris side-footed wide and Sa saved Keane Lewis-Potter's header from point-blank range.\nA melee at the end of the match suggested these two teams are pretty sick of the sight of each other, which could at least make for a spicy replay in just over a week.\nBrentford's next game is on Saturday January 20 when they host Nottingham Forest in the Premier League, live on Sky Sports; kick-off 5.30pm. The Bees then travel to Tottenham on Wednesday January 31; kick-off 7.30pm.\nWolves' next outing is away to Brighton in the Premier League on Monday January 22; kick-off 7.45pm. Gary O'Neil's side then host Manchester United on Thursday February 1; kick-off 8.15pm.",
