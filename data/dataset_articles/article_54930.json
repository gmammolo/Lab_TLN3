Vedang Raina who portrayed the character of Reginald \"Reggie\" Mantle in The Archies, recently featured in an interview with Instant Bollywood. During the conversation, he shared insights into his relationships with co-stars Suhana, Khushi, and Agastya, discussing the aspects he admires and the things he patiently tolerates about them. Vedang Raina Calls Khushi Kapoor 'Generous' In an interview with Instant Bollywood, Vedang Raina talked about his rumoured girlfriend Khushi Kapoor. He shared, “I love the fact that she is always looking around for others and she is very generous. She puts others before herself. Tolerate about her that… I said this before as well, but it is not like really tolerating or something, but it is a fact that I would like to change about her. Something I'd like to change about her is that she goes on a self-doubt trip sometimes. She'd question herself and her abilities. And I would like her to have more confidence in herself.” View this post on Instagram Opening up about working with Suhana Khan, Vedang Raina expressed, “I love the fact that she is very caring for the people around her, and tolerate the fact that she used to take the most time to get ready on set. So, we used to all be waiting for her. Her hair checks would take the most of the time compared to anyone else.” [ALSO READ: Koffee With Karan 8: Janhvi Kapoor On Working With NTR Jr In Devara, 'I Feel Better About Myself'](https://english.jagran.com/entertainment/koffee-with-karan-8-janhvi-kapoor-on-working-with-ntr-jr-in-devara-i-feel-better-about-myself-10124840) He further opened up about his equation with Agastya Nanda. Raina said, “I love the fact that he is very open to becoming friends. He is very easy to be friendly with. We broke the ice on day 1. Our friendship was like a really important part of my journey in the film. And tolerate about him is that he is very bad at texting. So, he does not reply to me very quickly. It may take a day or two for him to get back to me.” Vedang added that Agastya is “a very affectionate person. He will jump on you, touch you, hug you.” [English Jagran.com](https://english.jagran.com/)Jagran English is available on WhatsApp. Join now for latest news from India and around the world.
