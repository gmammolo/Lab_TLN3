  "text": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard and her husband Ryan Anderson are loving their new chapter together! The spouses spoke to Access Hollywood about being “newly-together-weds” following Gypsy’s release from prison and shared their hopes to start a family, each gushing over how the other would shine as a parent. Plus, the couple giggled as Access brought up Gypsy’s now-viral clapback at a troll sending Ryan hate. “I did like that my wife fought for me. It does feel good. Don’t mess with this one … She’s a firecracker,” Ryan said. Then, Gypsy answered some fun, rapid-fire questions, revealing her celebrity crush, favorite book, and the star she most wants to meet! Lifetime’s six-hour, three-night special “The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard” premieres Jan. 5 at 8/7c and concludes on Jan. 7. Each night’s episodes stream on Lifetime the following day. “Released: Conversations on the Eve of Freedom” is out Jan. 9. Tune in to see more of Gypsy’s interview on “Access Hollywood” next week.
