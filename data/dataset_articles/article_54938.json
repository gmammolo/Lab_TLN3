  "text": "PORTLAND, Maine — Kate Shaffer of Ragged Coast Chocolate Baking Co. joined us in the 207 kitchen to share recipes from her cookbook,\n\"Desserted: Recipes and Tales from an Island Chocolatier.\"\nDark Chocolate Cake\nIngredients:\n- ½ cup vegetable oil\n- ½ cup olive oil\n- ½ cup buttermilk\n- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n- 3 large eggs (room temperature)\n- 2 cups Maine Grains 75 percent sifted, all-purpose flour\n- 2 cups dark brown sugar\n- ½ cup of Dutch process cocoa, sifted\n- 2 teaspoons baking soda\n- ½ teaspoon salt\n- 1 cup boiling water\nInstructions:\n- Heat your oven to 350°F. In a large bowl beat together the vegetable and olive oil, eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla extract.\n- In a separate bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt. Add these ingredients to the oil/egg mixture and whisk until smooth.\n- Add the boiling water to the batter and whisk until smooth.\n- Pour the batter into the prepared pan(s) and bake for 20-22 minutes. To test for doneness, pierce the cake with a toothpick. If it comes out with just a few crumbs, the cake is done. (Ovens vary. You may need to check your cake sooner than the stated times.)\n- Cool the cake(s) in the pan(s) for 10 minutes, then invert onto a serving plate. Cool completely before filling, frosting, or serve as is.\nTo make this recipe even easier, you can use\nRagged Coast Baking Co’s Chocolate Cake Mix!",
