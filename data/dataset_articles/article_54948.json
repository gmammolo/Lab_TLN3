  "text": "A no-fuss breakfast is so easy with this sheet pan omelet – a quick option that works seamlessly for quick mornings or make-ahead meals. Tailor it to your liking with different mix-ins for a breakfast that hits the spot.\nThis sheet pan omelet is an easy solution to busy mornings. A healthy breakfast is a great way to start the day, but there are only so many times you can eat a bowl of cereal or a piece of toast. I don't know about you, but I need a little variation to keep morning meals interesting.\nThe beauty of sheet pan omelets is that they can be made to suit almost any palate. Change up the cheese, leave out the meat, swap in your favorite veggies - the options are endless. Plus, they can they can be made ahead of time and reheated as needed.\nFor other easy breakfast options, try my\nEnglish Breakfast Sandwich or Avocado Toast with Egg & Tomato.\nTips for making this recipe\n- Pre-Cook the Broccoli: Sauteing the broccoli first ensures that it is properly cooked and tender.\n- Evenly Spread: When you transfer the sautéed broccoli to the\nquarter sheet pan, make sure it's spread out evenly. This ensures every square inch gets its fair share of deliciousness.\n- Experiment with Mix-ins: Don't be afraid to get creative with additional mix-ins. Diced bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, or even cooked sausage can add extra layers of flavor and texture.\n- Test for Doneness: Insert a toothpick or a knife into the center of the omelet. If it comes out clean or with just a few cooked egg bits clinging to it, your sheet pan omelet is ready.\nSee recipe card below for full ingredients list & recipe directions.\nSubstitutions\nFeel free to switch things up to match your taste or what's in your pantry:\n- HAM: Use cooked turkey sausage or bacon in place of the ham. For a vegetarian option, skip the ham or replace it with black beans or your favorite meat substitute.\n- CHEESE: Experiment with different cheese varieties – pepper jack, feta, or smoked Gouda are all good options.\n- VEGGIES: Swap broccoli for other veggies like onions, bell peppers, spinach, or mushrooms.\nKEEP IN TOUCH\nand receive recipes straight to your inbox!\nVariations\n- SOUTHWESTERN: Fill with black beans, corn and tomatoes, and top with a dollop of fresh salsa.\n- SPANISH: Fill with sautéed onions and cooked diced potatoes. Brown the potatoes first for extra flavor. This combo nicely mimics a traditional Spanish tortilla.\n- GREEK-INSPIRED: Fill with tomatoes, feta cheese and Kalamata olives.\n- MUSHROOM LOVERS: Fill with sautéed mushrooms and smoked Gouda cheese. Try a variety of mushrooms, such as crimini and shiitake.\nHow to make sheet pan omelet\nCOOK THE BROCCOLI: Pre-cooking the broccoli ensures tender broccoli in your finished omelet. You have a few options for cooking it. In this recipe, I sautéed the broccoli in a little olive oil. If you prefer an oil-free option, blanch the broccoli in boiling, salted water for 1 to 2 minutes or steam the broccoli florets.\nPREP THE INGREDIENTS: Chop the ham, whisk the eggs with the milk and grate the Cheddar cheese.\nARRANGE IN SHEET PAN: Lightly coat\na quarter sheet pan with cooking spray. Arrange the broccoli and the chopped ham on the sheet pan, spreading evenly. Pour the egg mixture over the fillings, then sprinkle the grated Cheddar cheese over top.\nCOOK THE OMELET: Bake the sheet pan omelette until the egg is set, about 15 to 20 minutes. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the egg. If it comes out clean, the egg is cooked. Alternatively, give the pan a shake. The egg in the center shouldn’t move once cooked.\nWhat to serve with an omelet\nEnjoy your sheet pan omelet as is for a quick, satisfying breakfast, or get creative:\n- Breakfast Sandwich: Sandwich a square between an English muffin, along with sliced tomatoes, for a hearty grab-and-go breakfast.\n- Side or Fruit Salad: Serve with a\nfruit salador strawberry smoothiefor breakfast. If serving as a light lunch or dinner, pair the omelet with a green salad tossed with apple cider vinegar dressing.\nFor more ideas see\nWhat to Serve with Quiche.\nMeal Prep and Make-Ahead\nMAKE-AHEAD AND STORAGE: Prepare a batch over the weekend, cut into squares, and refrigerate in an airtight container for a grab-and-go breakfast all week long. It reheats like a champ.\nFREEZE: Cool the cooked omelet to room temperature, then wrap the individuals in several layers of plastic wrap. Place in a ziptop freezer bag and freeze for up to 3 months.\nREHEAT: Reheat in the oven, toaster oven or microwave for a quick and easy breakfast the next day. The omelet takes 30 seconds to 1 minute to reheat in the microwave on 50% power, depending on the wattage of your microwave. Using a higher heat tends to make the eggs rubbery.\nIf frozen, allow the omelet to defrost first in the refrigerator before reheating.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nYes, you can use frozen broccoli. Thaw and drain frozen broccoli before sautéing to prevent excess moisture.\nWhisking the eggs vigorously creates air pockets, resulting in a light and fluffy texture. Use the whisk to “lift” the eggs as you whisk upwards in a circle.\nTo test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the egg. If it comes out clean, the egg is cooked. Alternatively, give the pan a shake. The egg in the center shouldn’t move once cooked.\nDefinitely! Just scale up the ingredients accordingly and use a larger sheet pan. Increase the cooking time as necessary to fully cook the omelet.\nOther Breakfast Recipes You'll Love\nIf you make this recipe, please let me know!
