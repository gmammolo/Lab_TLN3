You can make these in a little over 30 minutes.\nServes9\nPrep15 minutes\nCook30 minutes\nindependentlyselect these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.\nWhen I’m in the mood for a\nchocolatey dessert, I want to get baking STAT — looking up a recipe and heading to the grocery store just won’t do. Instead, I make these two-ingredient brownies. As long as you have a bag of chocolate chips and half a dozen eggs on hand, you can make a batch of these super-easy and rich brownies in a little over 30 minutes.\nIngredients in 2-Ingredient Brownies\n- Chocolate: Both chocolate chips and chocolate bars will work for this recipe, so use whatever’s easiest for you.\n- Eggs: Whipped whole eggs provide the structure for these brownies. There’s no need for any fussy yolk and white separating here!\nHow to Make 2-Ingredient Brownies\n- Whip the eggs. The secret to these brownies is whipped eggs. Doing so incorporates air, which significantly increases their volume and makes for taller brownies.\n- Melt the chocolate. While the eggs are whipping (either in a\nstand mixeror with an electric hand mixer), there’s just enough time to gently melt the chocolate in the microwave.\n- Fold the two together. Once you have incorporated all that air into the eggs, you don’t want to lose that when combining it with the melted chocolate. The best technique is to add it a quarter at a time, and then gently fold, rather than stir, the two ingredients together.\n- Bake the brownies. They’re done in less than 30 minutes.\nTips for Making 2-Ingredient Brownies\n- Select the right\ntype of chocolate. Because the chocolate provides the sugar in the recipe, I don’t recommend anything darker than 60% or semi-sweet chocolate. Also, the quality of your chocolate will significantly affect the flavor outcome of this recipe. If you have a favorite high-quality chocolate you prefer, this is the time to use it.\n- Add mix-ins. These two-ingredient brownies are a blank slate for getting creative. Mix in a 1/2 cup of chopped nuts, marshmallows, or chocolate chips for texture. Or, try adding a teaspoon of vanilla or another extract, or even a tablespoon of\ninstant espresso powderto enhance the flavor of the brownies. Once cool, dust the tops of the brownies with powdered sugar.\n2-Ingredient Brownies Recipe\nHave chocolate chips and eggs on hand? You can make these in a little over 30 minutes.\nPrep time 15 minutes\nCook time 30 minutes\nServes9\nNutritional Info\nIngredients\n- 6\nlarge eggs\n- 1 (12-ounce) bag\nsemi-sweet chocolate chips (about 1 2/3 cups)\nInstructions\nArrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 350ºF. Line an 8x8-inch square baking pan with 2 pieces overlapping parchment paper with a 2-inch overhang on all 4 sides to form a sling.\nPlace 6 large eggs in the bowl of a stand mixer (or large bowl if using an electric hand mixer). Beat with the whisk attachment, starting on low speed and gradually increasing to the highest speed, until significantly increased in volume and a pale yellow color, about 8 minutes.\nMeanwhile, place 1 (12-ounce) bag chocolate chips in a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH for 1 minute. Stir and microwave for 30 seconds more. Stir again. Continue to microwave in 15-second intervals until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Let cool for at least 2 minutes. (If you don’t have a microwave-safe bowl large enough, microwave the chocolate in a smaller bowl or melt on the stovetop instead, then transfer to a large bowl.)\nAdd 1/4 of the eggs into the chocolate and fold together with a flexible spatula until just combined. Repeat folding in the remaining eggs in 3 batches, then continue to gently fold until no light streaks remain.\nPour into the baking pan and spread out into an even layer. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 23 to 30 minutes.\nLet the brownies cool completely in the pan, about 30 minutes. Grasping the excess parchment, lift the brownie slab out of the pan and place on a cutting board. Cut into squares.\nRecipe Notes\nStorage: The brownies can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 1 week, or refrigerated for up to 2 weeks. The brownies can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil and frozen for up to 6 months. Thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature.",
