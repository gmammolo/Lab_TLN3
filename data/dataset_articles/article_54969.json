  "text": "Bridgerton season 3 and the 9 best romantic Netflix shows to fall head over heels for in 2024 Along with Bridgerton, love will be in the air on Netflix in 2024 thanks to One Day, Emily in Paris, Young Royals, and more! By [Reed Gaudens](https://netflixlife.com/author/rgaudens/) Even though mysteries and crime thrillers are some of the most consistently popular genres of Netflix shows, there's an [audience that's just as big for romance](https://netflixlife.com/2023/12/03/best-romantic-movies-on-netflix-in-2023/). Between Emily's complicated search for love in Emily in Paris and the Bridgerton family's sprawling love stories in Bridgerton, a number of romantic shows have burned up Netflix's top 10. Can you blame them? Thankfully, in 2023, Netflix gave us a solid handful of amazing romantic shows, but there are even more heavy hitters making their way back to our watch lists in 2024. The aforementioned Bridgerton already has a two-part release date for season 3 this summer, while the likes of Virgin River, Young Royals, and My Life with the Walter Boys will back, too. Let's begin the excitement for the romantic shows coming to Netflix throughout 2024 with the title that's perhaps the most highly anticipated overall: Bridgerton season 3! Bridgerton season 3 It's about time, right?! After over two years since season 2 premiered in March 2022, Bridgerton season 3 — at long last! — [arrives in two parts in 2024](https://netflixlife.com/2023/12/12/bridgerton-season-3-release-date-cast-trailer-synopsis/). The first half of the season drops on May 16 and the second half on June 13. Since fans expected the season to be released at the end of 2023 or early 2024, it's still a longer wait than was anticipated. But at least Netflix has finally revealed one of the most sought after release dates of the year. Of course, the third season will continue the various loose ends left behind by season 2, but the story will now focus on Colin and Penelope and adapt the fourth book in Julia Quinn's book series. (Yes, they're [skipping over Benedict's story... for now](https://netflixlife.com/2023/11/26/bridgerton-season-3-skipping-benedict/).) \"Polin\" has been perhaps the most eagerly awaited love stories of the series, and it's about to heat up Netflix's summer in a big way. Beyond season 3, Netflix already has Bridgerton season 4 in the works, but don't expect that season in 2024, too. One Day Hungry for another page-to-screen adaptation that's full of romance and might (okay, definitely will) make you cry? One Day needs to be on your watch list in February 2024. The 14-episode limited series, which is based on the book by David Nicholls and was also an Anne Hathaway movie, is the kind of love story that will hook you and break your heart. The White Lotus breakout Leo Woodall stars alongside Ambika Mod, and together they play Emma and Dexter, a pair that meets and falls in love. We spend one fateful day with them throughout many, many years. One Day releases on Netflix on Feb. 8, just ahead of Valentine's Day, making it the perfect title to watch whether you're in a relationship, single, or it's complicated. As the only new Netflix show featured on this list (so far), we'd be remiss to exclude it because it's sure to be a fan-favorite. And if you love the romance, you can always read the book and watch the movie after binge-watching the full limited series. Also, heed that warning: You will need some tissues handy. Young Royals season 3 One of the most beloved teen shows on Netflix, Young Royals will be back for its [third and final season](https://netflixlife.com/2023/10/17/young-royals-season-3-release-updates/) in March 2024. The Swedish romantic drama series takes place in an elite boarding school as a (fictional) prince falls for another student. Naturally, their relationship isn't easy given the prince's status. But who doesn't love a royal love story? It's super fun to watch the fantasy of a normal person falling in love with prince or princess, whether it's Cinderella or Young Royals. As sad as fans will be that the third season is the last, it's so exciting that the series will be able to go out by telling the story that it wants to tell. Edvin Ryding, Omar Rudberg, Malte Gårdinger, Frida Argento, Nikita Uggla, and more familiar faces will be back in their roles for the final episodes. Currently, Netflix hasn't announced the exact release date for season 3, but March will be the month of Simon and Wilhelm. Prepare your heart for major swooning! Emily in Paris season 4 We definitely had a blue Christmas in 2023 without a new season of Emily in Paris to fawn over. Because of the dual strikes that halted the entirety of the film and television industry for nearly half of the year, a long list of movies and shows were massively delayed, including Netflix's Emmy-nominated romantic comedy darling. That means, by the time we finally watch season 4, it will have been almost or just about two years. We've never had to wait that long for Emily! But [season 4 of Emily in Paris](https://netflixlife.com/2023/09/08/emily-in-paris-season-4-release-updates-cast-filming-news/) will without question be worth the wait. A major bomb was dropped at the end of season 3 that could throw an impenetrable wrench in Emily's romantic plans with Gabriel. Camille's pregnancy casts a shadow over the glimmer of hope that Emily and Gabriel, whose separate relationships both imploded, [could get together at long last](https://netflixlife.com/posts/emily-in-paris-season-4-cant-miss-gabriel-01hhmdyrsezq). We'll be waiting until at least fall 2024 for Emily Cooper to make her comeback, but whenever she does, it'll be oh-so sweet. Virgin River season 6 Does it get much more romantic than Virgin River? The romantic drama series has arguably become not only the top romantic show on the streaming service but one of its top shows period. In September 2023, the fifth season of the fan-adored series debuted with 10 episodes, then in November, two Christmas-themed episodes released to wrap up the season and set up season 6 with a festive twist. It's [one of the best seasons of the series](https://netflixlife.com/2023/11/30/virgin-river-season-5-recap-guide-episodes-explained/), paving the way for an amazing sixth season. The Christmas episodes followed Mel's discovery that her real birth father lives in Virgin River, and she and Jack track him down. Although Everett Reid initially lies to her, he later admits that he's her birth father and he has a mysterious something to tell her. That's just one of the many cliffhangers we're looking forward to getting answers for in season 6, which will likely hit our watch lists sometime in fall 2024. The drama and romance can't come back soon enough! Heartstopper season 3 Hands down the cutest and most heartwarming show on Netflix, the teen romantic comedy-drama series Heartstopper will be back for season 3 in 2024. Thankfully, the [third season has already wrapped filming](https://netflixlife.com/2023/10/02/heartstopper-season-3-release-updates/), as the British series was the rare show not to be incredibly delayed by the strikes. After the second season made its arrival in August 2023, the third should follow suit about a year or less later in summer 2024. Heartstopper season 2 was a game changer for all of our favorite characters and their relationships. Chiefly, Nick grappled with coming out as bisexual to the world and being open with his relationship with Charlie. By the end of the season, both boys were prepared to drop that very first \"I love you,\" but an interruption kept those three words lingering in the air. Until season 3 arrives on Netflix later this year, we have Alice Oseman's books to keep us company. My Life with the Walter Boys season 2 Right in the nick of time, a new teen romance series slipped in under the wire to become a new favorite and staple on Netflix. My Life with the Walter Boys premiered in Decemember 2023 and immediately peaked in the No. 1 spot in the top 10, where it was parked for over a week. Because of its overnight success, Netflix quickly [renewed the series for a second season](https://netflixlife.com/2023/12/07/everything-we-know-my-life-with-the-walter-boys-season-2/) less than two weeks after its premiere. 2023 was definitely Netflix's year of rapid renewals. It's the show everyone is talking about right now, but as of January 2024, there isn't much season 2 news to report. But we're keeping our fingers crossed that filming is able to get underway as soon as possible so season 2 makes its way to our watch lists by the end of the year. (Don't wait until 2025, Netflix!) After all, we need [all of our burning questions answered](https://netflixlife.com/posts/7-burning-questions-we-still-have-for-my-life-with-the-walter-boys-season-2), and we need to see what's next in the Jackie, Alex, and Cole love triangle. Sweet Magnolias season 4 You didn't think we were finished pouring it out with the Sweet Magnolias, did you? Nope! There's plenty more margaritas and chips and salsa in our future with Maddie, Dana Sue, and Helen as they continue their small-town journeys through love, family, and friendship. However, with the way season 3 ended, we're not quite sure what to expect from season 4. Regardless, star [JoAnna Garcia Swisher has already warned fans to \"buckle up.\"](https://netflixlife.com/2023/11/13/sweet-magnolias-season-4-will-another-season/) Netflix officially picked up Sweet Magnolias season 4 in October 2023, which came months after the release of season 3 that July. There had been reasonable questions about the show's future in spite of its success since the season 3 finale seemed to wrap up each storyline. But alas, we haven't made our final trip to Serenity! Garcia Swisher, Brooke Elliott, Heather Headley, and the usual suspects will be back for the fourth season. We're predicting a hopeful release by the end of 2024, but we'll have to wait and see if the romantic drama makes it back this year. XO, Kitty season 2 One of 2023's most pleasant surprises, the To All the Boys I've Loved Before spinoff series XO, Kitty premiered in May 2023 and became a new hit teen series for Netflix. However, in some ways, the series still seems underrated. The show comes from To All the Boys author Jenny Han, who also wrote and created fellow hit teen page-to-screen series The Summer I Turned Pretty. Gen Z has Han to thank for two teen shows that will likely define their generation. Two months after XO, Kitty debuted to positive reviews and decent viewership, Netflix [renewed the teen romance for a second season](https://netflixlife.com/2023/11/09/xo-kitty-season-2-everything-we-know-so-far/). Kitty Song Covey's misadventures in young love and friendship will continue at her South Korean boarding school. It's such a fun, endearing, and wildly entertaining teen series, and we hope it's back much sooner than later in 2024, maybe fall or even into the holidays. As long as it's back this year! The next chapter of Kitty's love life will surely be even more exciting, complicated, and stylish.",
