  "text": "You can add Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles to the list of Bryce Young believers. Oh, and when you do, make sure he’s somewhere towards the top.\nBowles spoke with reporters on Friday, his final chat ahead of the Week 18 matchup between his playoff-hopeful Bucs and the 2-14 Carolina Panthers. He had this, via Bucs Wire editor River Wells, to say about the rookie quarterback he’ll be facing off against this weekend:\nTodd Bowles says that Panthers QB Bryce Young will be “one of the best to ever do it” by the time his career is over. Says he’s very impressed with his poise and his ability as a scrambler\n— River Wells (@riverhwells) January 5, 2024\nSunday will mark the second time Bowles and the Bucs match up with Young. The first clash came in Week 13 , when the No. 1 overall pick nearly led a fourth-quarter comeback in an eventual 21-18 Tampa Bay win.\nYoung wasn’t exactly at his best in what was a muddy outing. He completed 15 of his 31 throws for 178 yards and a game-sealing interception to safety Antoine Winfield Jr.\nBut Bowles, who’s been coaching up NFL defenses for over two decades, apparently saw more than just the numbers back on Dec. 3.\nRelated Chris Tabor on season finale: 'We got a lot at stake' Panthers Week 18 injury report: Eddy Piñeiro doubtful vs. Buccaneers Chris Tabor on Bryce Young: 'He has all the things older QBs have'",
