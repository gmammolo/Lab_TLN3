  "text": "It’s All In The Genes: Stunning Celebrity Sisters\nWhen it comes to Hollywood, sometimes talent is purely genetic -- just look at Beyoncé and Solange Knowles. These celebrity sisters are as talented as they are iconic. From the stages of Coachella to the Royal Wedding, who wouldn't kill to have these stunning sisters in your family tree? What do you think Thanksgiving dinner is even like when you're rich and famous?\nBeyoncé and Solange Knowles\nIf one is the reigning queen of hip-hop, the other is the reigning princess. Beyoncé and Solange Knowles are a powerhouse of musical talent. While Bey rose to fame with her work in Destiny's Child and as a solo artist, Solange followed in her footsteps when she graced numerous magazine covers and rocked the headlining set at Pitchfork Music Festival.\nIn fact, we got the best of both worlds in 2018 when the sisters hit Coachella together (though it included a minor fall and a potentially disastrous wig slip.) Let's also not forget that Solange had the guts to spark an elevator brawl with Jay Z amidst cheating rumors. We love a girl who stands up for her sis.\nDakota And Elle Fanning\nDakota and Elle Fanning both landed their breakout roles in 2001's I Am Sam, but Dakota managed to rise to fame a little bit faster (she was four years older than her little sis.) Thanks to films like War of the Worlds, The Runaways, and Twilight, Dakota quickly became a Hollywood \"it\" girl (a major role in a film adaptation of a YA novel tends to do that.) Elle wasn't far behind and rose to Hollywood's mainstream with We Bought a Zoo and Maleficent.\nToday, the sisters are both wildly successfully, but they've managed to avoid working together as adults (aside from some voice work in My Neighbor Totoro). Why? They keep getting cast as sisters and want to venture into different roles.\nGigi And Bella Hadid\nFor Gigi and Bella Hadid, being a supermodel is the family business. It's no big deal. Their mother Yolanda Hadid, who stars on Bravo's Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, was accomplished in the field before achieving reality TV fame, so what do you expect from her offspring? Pretty big things, as it turns out.\nIn 2017, W Magazine claimed Bella ruled the world thanks to campaigns from Alexander Wang and Giuseppe Zanotti. Gigi has also nabbed major campaigns from equally big brands like Stuart Weitzman, Fendi, and Maybelline. It certainly doesn't hurt that their BFFs are Kendall Jenner and Taylor Swift. You don't get more famous than that.\nKate And Pippa Middleton\nOne is a duchess and the other is a style icon. Kate and Pippa Middleton are the epitome of class. By 2011, Kate was already used to the spotlight. It's just tricks of the trade when your husband and children are heirs to the British throne. Pippa, on the other hand, was considered a commoner until the world realized they absolutely adore her.\nSince the royal nuptials, Pippa has been thrown into the global spotlight. You can thank her numerous celebrity boyfriends, fancy hats, and stylish gowns. She's so beloved that as of 2018, she's even getting her own royal title. As it turns out her hedge fund hubby has royal blood because his father is Laird of Glen Affric. Pippa will eventually be Lady Glen Affric once her husband inherits his father's 10,000-acre estate.\nVenus and Serena Williams\nIt's rare that one person becomes a world-renowned tennis star, let alone two from the same family. Venus and Serena Williams have an unreal amount of accolades between them. Venus is a seven-time Grand Slam title winner for singles and Serena is a 23-time Grand Slam title winner. They've slain professional tennis to the point where they're basically their only rivals.\nBetween 2001's US Open and the 2017 Australian Open, Venus and Serena duked it out in nine Grand Slam finals. They became the first two players to compete in four back-to-back Grand Slam singles, but Serena took the title home for each of them. If that's not a rivalry, what is?\nEmily and Zooey Deschanel\nZooey Deschanel is arguably the most famous of these two stunning sisters. Her penchant for quirky dresses and her signature bangs have graced the big screen and the stage. Though she's toured the world with her indie pop band She & Him, she's best known for her sitcom New Girl, which just aired its final season on Fox.\nEmily Deschanel has similar talents. She's definitely in the family business and is best known for her dramatic character on Fox crime drama Bones. She's starred in all 245 episodes, along with roles in films like Spider-Man 2.\nAshlee and Jessica Simpson\nThe Simpson sisters have some major chops. Sure, Ashlee had the world's most embarrassing Saturday Night Live moment when it was revealed she was lip-synching along to a backing track, but let's not be too hard on the pair. They're still massively talented.\nJessica Simpson was the first of the siblings to achieve fame with her music (and her inescapable beauty and shoe lines). She was a pioneer in the realm of trashy celebrity reality shows with MTV's Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica, and Ashlee quickly followed in her footsteps with her own reality show. In fact, Ashlee penned the song \"Shadow\" about living in the wake of her older sister's massive success. Since then, she's managed to gain fame in own right as an actress and mom.\nAudrey and Judy Landers\nThey're '70s TV icons and sartorial mavens. The Lander sisters' patented loud sense of style is something they've still got going on today. It may even make them one of the most iconic duos in Hollywood history (at least if you're following bloodlines.) Audrey is best known for her work on Dallas and A Chorus Line, while her sister became famous after starring in The Love Boat – but that doesn't mean their careers have always been separate.\nAfter appearing together on The Love Boat, the Landers sisters made every man in America's dreams come true when they both posed in an iconic 1983 cover of Playboy. The only thing sexier than one sister posing in lingerie is two.\nZsa Zsa and Eva Gabor\nSome credit '50s icon Zsa Zsa Gabor as shaping the idea of a modern-day Hollywood celebrity. The actress and socialite was crowned Miss Hungary and emigrated to America before starring in the 1952 classic Moulin Rouge. Zsa Zsa's younger sister Eva eventually became just as famous with roles in Green Acres, The Aristocats, and The Rescuers. The pair even worked together in the play Arsenic and Old Lace.\nZsa Zsa and Eva weren't the only two Gabor sisters to achieve fame. Their sister Magda never gained the same level of notoriety but performed in The Colgate Comedy Hour.\nFranca and Carla Sozzani\nFranca Sozzani is the reason you're wearing what you're wearing. The journalist was editor in chief of Vogue Italia for 27 yearsbefore she passed away in 2016. Her sister Carla was equally as influential in the fashion world. She launched the concept store 10 Corso Como, a Milan hotspot for art, culture and of course, fashion.\nThe pair were known by Anna Wintour, whose patented intensity served as Meryl Streep's Devil Wears Prada inspiration. She described Franca as the \"hardest-working person I have known.\" If that's how Wintour views you, we're exhausted just thinking about what your life might have actually been like. There's no doubt that the Sozzani's were some of the most influential sisters to ever take the fashion world by storm.\nNicky and Paris Hilton\nIn the early '00s, Nicky and Paris Hilton were arguably the most iconic sister duo. This pair had everything a person could want: a Hilton-sized trust fund, effortless style (barring a couple Von Dutch trucker hats and velour tracksuits) and adorable, tiny dogs (who got a dog house more luxurious than most of our apartments.)\nThe pair were seemingly famous for being famous and checked every tabloid box – from Paris' sex scandal to Nicky's five-minute marriages. There were reality TV shows, legal troubles, and short-lived music careers. They're exactly what socialites should be – at least if you ask Page Six.\nHaylie and Hillary Duff\nThese celebrity sisters are all-star collaborators. Hillary was the first to rise to fame with Disney Channel's Lizzie McGuire (you don't get much more iconic than that as a young actress.) Shortly after, Haylie found fame as a cast member on teen drama 7th Heaven and became a Lifetime movie staple. You simply can't do Lifetime films without Haylie (well, you can but they just don't have the same oomph.)\nWith Hilary's music career and piping new series Younger along with Haylie's Cooking Channel show The Real Girl's Kitchen, we've learned this iconic duo is always supportive and never jealous of each other's success, even if they're in the same lane. They regularly throw each other shout-outs on social media and continue to remain one of Hollywood's most adorable sister acts.\nTia and Tamara Mowry\nYou can't have Tia without Tamara. The pair rose to fame in the 1990s with their hit TV show Sister Sister. Since then, they've managed to maintain their Hollywood success by banding together and using what their mama gave them.\nIn 2011, the two sisters landed their own Style Network series. Tia got to show us the low-down on what it's actually like being pregnant and we got to live vicariously through Tamara as she planned her wedding. Now, their iconic series may be getting a highly anticipated reboot. If they did it for Boy Meets World, they really need to do it for Sister, Sister.\nTegan and Sara Quin\nTegan and Sara are more than just twin sisters – they're champions of LGBTQ rights and wrote some of the catchiest songs the world has ever seen. Plus, they've got some pretty adorable cats.\nTegan and Sara prove that sisters are always better when they put their talents together. The pair has released eight critically acclaimed studio albums and earned a Grammy nomination for their DVD and Live Album Get Along (let's not even mention how influential The Con was.)More importantly, the pair launched their own foundation called The Tegan and Sara foundation. They use this to fight for economic justice, health and representation for LGBTQ girls and women. There's nothing these sisters can't do.\nCara and Poppy Delevigne\nYou might recognize Cara Delevigne before her famous sister, but only because she's part of Taylor Swift's girl gang. The model actually followed in the footsteps of her famous sister Poppy. Poppy has modeled for major fashion houses like Burberry and Alberta Ferretti. Her little sis hopped on the scene working for one of those very same companies. In 2011, Cara landed the Burberry spring/summer campaign that would make her famous.\nUnlike her stunning sister, Delevigne ventured into Hollywood. With roles in films like Suicide Squad, Paper Towns and Pan, her acting chops are almost as in-demand as her face.\nLaura and Sarah Silverman\nComedian Sarah Silverman is now a household name. With her work in Wreck-It Ralph, Battle of the Sexes and There's Something About Mary, she's one of the most in-demand female comedians in all of Hollywood – and that's before you mention her numerous standup specials. Silverman also has a pretty talented, (but less famous) sister, though that's only because she doesn't often show her face in the projects she works on.\nLaura Silverman is an accomplished voice actress in beloved programs like Bob's Burgers and Adventure Time. She's also acted alongside her sis in The Comeback.\nMiley, Brandi, and Noah Cyrus\nJust one, single Cyrus sister is more successful than most of us could hope to be, let alone all three. The most recognizable of the Cyrus clan is Miley, who rose to fame in Disney Channel's Hannah Montana before launching her own music career away from the mouse. Brandi, who looks almost the same as Miley, is an actress and lifestyle blogger. The eldest Cyrus sister landed her own Bravo series called Cyrus vs. Cyrus: Design & Conquer where she redesigns homes with her mom.\nNoah is the youngest Cyrus and recently launched her own music career following in Miley's footsteps.\nMary Kate, Ashley and Elizabeth Olsen\nTwins Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen have been business partners since they were young. After rising to fame on Full House, the pair starred in numerous widely lauded straight-to-VHS films like It Takes Two and Passport to Paris. The recipe – two twins, a foreign location, and a couple cute boys -- just worked. Since their days as film and TV stars, they've retired from Hollywood and launched a wildly successful fashion brand, but sister Elizabeth Olsen is still keeping on with the family trade.\nElizabeth appears in films like Godzilla, Captain America: Civil War and Silent House. Most recently, she appeared in the highly anticipated Avengers: Infinity War.\nMalia and Sasha Obama\nThe Obama sisters didn't ask for fame but became role models to girls everywhere when their father, Barack Obama, became president. Though the girls tend to skirt the political spotlight, there's no doubt that they’ll one day change the world.\nMalia is currently studying at Harvard University – just like dad. She's also got a pretty hunky British boyfriend (let the girl live!) Sasha is still in high school but proves to be a style icon. She recently dyed her hair blue which graced headlines in Harper's Bazaar. Not too many teens can say their off-hand hair decisions have done that.\nLillian and Dorothy Gish\nBack in the days of prohibition, Lillian and Dorothy Gish were some of Hollywood's most sought-after silent film stars. Dorothy, the youngest of the pair, was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame for her life's work which includes titles like Intolerance and Life With Father along with various comedies, directing roles and writing credits.\nLillian, who was known as the First Lady of American Cinema, has equally as impressive credits like 1915's The Birth of a Nation and 1946's Duel in the Sun. She acted until the very last few years of her life and even appeared in 1987's The Whales of August.",
