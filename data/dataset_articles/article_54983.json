  "text": "‘Hello From The Hills’ Benefit Concert To Return To City Winery Nashville\nThe “Hello From The Hills” benefit concert, co-presented by The Hello in There Foundation and Hope in the Hills, will return to City Winery Nashville for its second annual event on Sunday, Jan. 28.\nThe Hello in There Foundation was founded by the family of John Prine in 2021 and aims to identify and collaborate with individuals and communities to offer support for people who are marginalized, discriminated against or, for any reason, are otherwise forgotten. Hope in the Hills is a nonprofit organization committed to combatting the opioid crisis and support recovery across Appalachia that was created by a group of local community members and members of music star Tyler Childers‘ team.\nThe event will feature acoustic performances from Childers, Wynonna Judd, Ben Folds, S.G. Goodman, Abby Hamilton, Gabe Lee, Lindsay Lou and Jeremy Short, among others, and will once again be hosted by NPR Mountain Stage’s Kathy Mattea.\n“We’re honored to team up with our good friends at The Hello In There Foundation to start out this new year by spreading joy, empathy and healing during our gathering to share music, light and love,” says Dave Lavender, Board President, Hope in the Hills. “We know soon enough 2024 will take its lumps with some people talking about a world of ‘us and them,’ of dividing and conquering, of building more walls and fences to keep out neighbors. We humbly approach this event, this year and this work, walking in compassion and empathy knowing as John Prine once wrote, ‘Broken hearts and dirty windows/Make life difficult to see.’ It is in that seeing and hearing spirit, we come together to honor some amazing nonprofits doing the good and hard work of helping folks in need, and in their doing, teach us all how to daily water and nurture the tree of hope and forgiveness.”\n“We’re thrilled to partner once again with Hope in the Hills for an incredible concert in support of nonprofits who are doing thoughtful, necessary work for people in need. These organizations truly embody the spirit of community care that John Prine shared with the world throughout his life,” adds Celine Thackston, Executive Director, The Hello in There Foundation.\nThe Hello in There Foundation and Hope in the Hills have selected three organizations to receive grants this year: MusiCares, which provides health and welfare services to the music community; Tennessee Justice for Our Neighbors, an organization that provides compassionate immigration legal services to those seeking humanitarian relief; and Musicians Recovery Network, which supports those struggling with addiction through the power of music, arts and spirituality.\nTickets will be available for presale starting this Wednesday (Jan. 10), with general sales following on Friday (Jan. 12).
