  "text": "Published5. January 2024, 10:11 p.m\nDog eats cash: “Cecil never did anything bad – until he ate $4,000”\nA Pittsburgh couple has had a nerve-wracking time. Your dog ate or tore up $4,000. They have now been able to get a large part of it back.\nvon1 / 6\n«This is Cecil. He’s never done anything bad in his life.”\nInstagram/Carrie Law\n“Until he ate $4,000,” writes Carrie Law in an Instagram\nvideo about the incident.\nInstagram/Carrie Law\nApart from vomiting, Cecil didn’t do anything.\nInstagram/Carrie Law\nThat’s what it’s about\n-\nClayton and Carrie Law were shocked when they caught their dog Cecil eating $4,000 in cash.\n-\nOver a period of days they were able to get the money back, wash it and put it together.\n-\nSo they now have $3,500 back.\nA couple’s dog in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, chose an expensive snack when he ate $4,000 in cash in December. Although the couple was able to get a large portion of the money back, the process to get there was nerve-wracking.\nClayton and Carrie Law had recently withdrawn the money to pay contractors who were building a garden slope. Clayton had put the money on the dining room table and half an hour later saw his dog Cecil messing with it. “I was shocked because it was so out of character for him. “He never took food off the table and I was in shock because that didn’t suit him at all,” Clayton told\nUSA Today.\nCecil had swallowed half of the money and tore up the other half. “We were pretty devastated when it happened,” says Clayton. “When Cecil woke us up at 2 a.m. because he was vomiting, we regained hope when we saw the $100 bills in the vomit.” Luckily nothing else bad happened to the dog.\nRead more: Short circuit, flames and record caller. Chevrolet and Hyundai are changing the batteries of 200,000 cars\n“We spent several hours a day trying to get the money back.”\nThe couple found that they could exchange the torn notes taped together at a bank and developed a division of labor for the rescue operation. Clayton collected Cecil’s feces, searched it for bills and washed them off while Carrie put the torn bills back together like a puzzle.\n“We spent several hours a day trying to get our money back,” said Carrie. “On the third day, the pieces of the bills became smaller, so we couldn’t put everything together.” However, the couple managed to save $3,500 of the original $4,000.\nA week after the disaster, Carrie posted a\nvideo of the incident on Instagram and wrote: “This is Cecil. He has never done anything bad in his life. Until he ate $4,000.” The video was liked almost 200,000 times and many dog owners shared similar experiences in the comments. Some bank employees also reported cases they had heard about at work.\nHave you been following on Whatsapp for 20 minutes?\nStay informed and subscribe to the 20 Minutes WhatsApp channel: Then you will receive an update with our most moving stories directly to your cell phone in the morning and evening – hand-picked, informative and inspiring.\n2024-01-05 21:47:16\n#Dog #eats #owners #money",
