  "text": "The Police Ombudsman has praised a University of Limerick course designed to provide bespoke training to staff working at the civilian oversight body, Fiosrú.\nPolice Ombudsman Emily Logan was speaking at the launch for the 2026 intake of the Fiosrú Law Enforcement Oversight Accreditation Programme, a bespoke course designed and delivered by UL’s School of Law in conjunction with Fiosrú, the Office of the Police Ombudsman, to support its staff learning and development.\nAddressing the 24 Fiosrú staff beginning their studies on the first day of the programme, the Police Ombudsman said:\n“I am delighted with the strong interest shown by Fiosrú’s staff in this unique bespoke programme. Staff from all parts of our organisation are eagerly learning about important topics including human rights laws and standards as well as police powers and laws and procedures related to criminal investigations in law enforcement oversight.\n“By developing their skills, knowledge and expertise, our staff are showing their commitment to strengthened oversight of An Garda Síochána. The impact of this course also means that the public can have greater trust in our skills and the services we provide.”\nFirst launched in 2025, the two-year postgraduate programme was developed to meet a key skills need for the organisation, which deals with complaints from the public where they have concerns about how they have been treated by gardaí.\nThe development of the programme has built on the UL School of Law’s prestige as a centre of excellence in criminal justice research and education, marking another milestone in the University’s strong relationship with the criminal justice sector.\nProfessor Lucy-Ann Buckley, Head of UL’s School of Law, commented: “We are delighted to welcome the second cohort of Fiosrú students to the Postgraduate Certificate in Law Enforcement Oversight. The School of Law is internationally renowned for its expertise in the field of criminal justice. This unique programme builds on that expertise and reflects the School of Law’s commitment to innovative, practice-focused legal education.”\nDr Michelle Stevenson, who is the programme director, added: “The programme reflects the School of Law’s commitment to uphold human rights in the criminal justice system, and centres these in all aspects of law enforcement oversight.”",
