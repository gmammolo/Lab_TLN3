  "text": "5 Underrated Places to Visit in Bali Translator Editor 5 January 2024 18:35 WIB TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTCC) lists Bali as one of the tourist destinations that experienced overtourism from January to November 2023, along with Amsterdam, Athens, Paris, Phuket, and Barcelona. Despite the issue, Bali still boasts a lot of appealing but less explored places. Here is the list of five lesser-known areas of Bali that are worth visiting to avoid the crowds on the heavenly island: 1. Jatiluwih Jatiluwih Village, located in Tabanan Regency, is home to vast terraced rice fields with a unique irrigation system known locally as Subak. The Jatiluwih Rice Terrace is recognized by UNESCO as the world's cultural heritage. Tourists can enjoy stunning views of Mount Batukaru and the expansive rice fields, all in a relatively tranquil atmosphere. 2. Golden Marigold Fields The Marigold fields are located in a high mountainous area of Belok Village, Petang District, Badung Regency. Tourists must traverse hilly roads amid misty mountains to arrive at Gemitir Flower Garden. The beds of orange marigold flowers will undoubtedly spoil visitors. Hindu communities in Bali frequently use the flower in their ceremonies and rituals. 3. Asah Hill Bukit Asah or Asah Hill is a beautiful plateau scenery located in Bugbug Village, Karangasem Regency, flanked by the steep Panggian Hill and White Bias beach known as Virgin Beach Bali. The hill provides a perfect serene escape from the crowds. 4. Bias Tugel Beach Bias Tugel Beach or White Sand Beach situated in Padangbai Village, Karangasem area features a rocky shoreline that encircles the headlands at both ends. The beach is called the whitest sand in Bali with clear seawater and a quiet ambiance. It also has a small lagoon where tourists can swim or soak in it. 5. Nyang-Nyang Beach Nyang-Nyang Beach is located in Pecatu Village, South Kuta of Badung, close to Uluwatu. The beach offers clean white sand and ocean waves that are perfect for professional surfers. Its slightly secluded location provides complete privacy and tranquility for tourists. These hidden gems in Bali offer a unique and tranquil experience for tourists seeking an escape from the crowds while still enjoying the island's natural beauty and cultural richness.
