  "text": "In his recent annual report on Meadville Central Fire Department, Chief Evan Kardosh described a year of milestones and accomplishments in which the department expanded its staff, increased its certifications and completed nearly 3,100 calls with an average response time of less than 2:30 for incidents in the city.\n“Truly it’s hard for this document to put in the work that the men and women down there do,” Kardosh told members of Meadville City Council, referencing his 12-page report full of response-related statistics. “They’re the ones that are truly making the difference and I want that to be what people realize — that they really are the ones making the difference, putting the work in, doing the hours and making a difference in our community.”",
