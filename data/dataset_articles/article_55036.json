Inter Milan vs Hellas Verona Picks - Pick: Inter Handicap -1.5. Verona is tied with Cagliari for 18th place, but is outside of the relegation zone because of a better goal differential. Verona would like to pick up a few more points to get some breathing room.

Inter vs Hellas Verona Information Inter vs Hellas Verona Location of the game: Giuseppe Meazza Stadium, Milan, Italy Date & Time: Saturday, Jan. 6, 2024 7:45 a.m. How to watch: Paramount Inter vs Hellas Verona Analysis Inter’s Defense Puts Clamps Down on Everyone Soccer statistics show that Inter has only conceded eight goals in 18 league matches so far this season. That has put Inter in first place and with a great opportunity to win the Serie A title. Inter’s attack is led by Lautaro Martinez, who has a team-high 15 goals. But [Inter Milan](https://insidersbettingdigest.com/soccer/italy/internazionale/) has plenty of balance. Hakan Calhanoglu and Marcus Thuram are second on the team with seven goals apiece. Thuram leads the team with six assists. Federico Dimarco has also added three goals. In the past four matches, Inter has possessed the ball for 50 percent or more of the match. Inter Projected Lineup Sommer; Pavard, Acerbi, Bastoni; Darmian, Barella, Calhanoglu, Mkhitaryan, Dimarco; Thuram, Martinez Inter Injuries: Inter will see Benjamin Pavard return from injury. Verona Has Some Challenges Ahead Verona is in a real fight to avoid relegation. Anyone looking at Inter vs Hellas Verona Odds will see that Verona needs to be more effective at finishing to earn the points necessary to climb the standings. Serie A scores show that [Hellas Verona](https://insidersbettingdigest.com/soccer/italy/hellas-verona/) has been shut out in two of its previous three matches. Verona has produced an xG of .9 or less in its past two matches. Verona did get a recent win over fellow relegation target Cagliari, which boosted its spirits. However, with Inter on the [Serie A schedule](https://insidersbettingdigest.com/soccer/serie-a/schedule/) and some other tough opponents on the horizon, Verona won’t be able to celebrate too long. Cyril Ngonge leads Veron with five goals, while Milan Duric has four. Beyond that, Verona has struggled to develop effective attacking players who can finish consistently. Verona Projected Lineup Montipo; Tchatchoua, Dawidowicz, Magnani, Doig; Duda, Folorunsho; Ngonge, Suslov, Lazovic; Djuric Verona Injuries Verona didn’t have an updated injury report available. Inter vs Hellas Verona Pick and Prediction [Serie A odds](https://insidersbettingdigest.com/soccer/serie-a/) show that Inter is too expensive to be on the [moneyline](https://insidersbettingdigest.com/guides/moneyline-betting-guide/). People betting the match would be better off looking at a spread of prop bets for their [Serie A picks](https://insidersbettingdigest.com/news/soccer/serie-a/). Inter -1.5 may be a strong option as Verona will likely have a hard time scoring. Also, betting not both teams to score would provide a better number. - Pick: Inter Handicap -1.5.
