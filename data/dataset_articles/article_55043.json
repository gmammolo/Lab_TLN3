Recipe of the Week: Black Bean Burgers Ingredients: - Canned black beans - 2 spring onions (scallions) - Handful of cilantro - 1 cup breadcrumbs - Â½ a lime - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce - 1 tablespoon of tahini - 2 tablespoons of avocado oil - Mini buns Instructions: Step 1 Drain and rinse the canned black beans. Add them to a large bowl. Step 2 Finely chop two spring onions and a handful of fresh cilantro and add to the beans. Step 3 Add one cup of breadcrumbs, half of a lime's zest, one tablespoon of soy sauce and one tablespoon of tahini and mix and mash well with your hands until it comes together into a soft burger mix. Step 4 Take a scoop of the mixture, roll it into a ball and flatten into a one inch burger-shaped patty. Continue with the remaining mixture. Step 5 Chill your mini burgers until required â€“ ideally at least 30 minutes. Step 6 To cook, heat a tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan. Cook the mini burgers over a medium heat for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden brown and crispy. Step 7 Assemble the burger by adding your favorite toppings and condiments. Expert tip: Elevate this plant-based meal by serving with a side of crispy kale chips. Simply rinse, chop and bake kale leaves and sprinkle with salt for the perfect pairing. The black bean burgers are now ready to be enjoyed! Whether you're tailgating at Levi'sÂ® Stadium or cooking up a gameday meal at home, this dish is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.",
