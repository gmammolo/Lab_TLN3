  "text": "Watch the animated short featuring the series’ 2nd single, with vocals by Blake Roman; the new series streams January 19 on Prime Video with early access January 12 on A24’s app. [Prime Video](https://www.awn.com/tag/prime-video) and A24 Music have shared “Poison,” the second single from the soundtrack of the highly anticipated adult animation series [Hazbin Hotel](https://www.awn.com/tag/hazbin-hotel). The high-energy pop track is written and produced by composers Sam Haft and Andrew Underberg, and features vocals by Blake Roman. Check out the animated lyric video of “Poison” below. The season premieres with the first four episodes on January 19, 2024, with two more rolling out each week through February 2. The series will stream in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. Hazbin Hotel follows Charlie, the princess of Hell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitating demons to peacefully reduce overpopulation in her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed by angels, she opens a hotel in the hopes that patrons will be \"checking out\" into heaven. While most of Hell mocks her goal, her devoted partner Vaggie and their first test subject, adult-film star Angel Dust, stick by her side. When a powerful entity known as the \"Radio Demon\" reaches out to assist Charlie in her endeavors, her crazy dream is given a chance to become a reality. Created by Vivienne Medrano, Hazbin Hotel is based on her popular animated pilot released on YouTube in 2019 that quickly generated over 89 million views and a rabid worldwide fan base. The series blends adult humor, unforgettable characters, and catchy musical numbers, creating a wholly original and unique world. Check out the lyric video and get a taste of “Poison:” Medrano serves as executive producer and director for all episodes. Joel Kuwahara, Dana Tafoya-Cameron, and Scott Greenberg (Season 1) also serve as executive producers. Hazbin Hotel is produced by A24 and FOX Entertainment’s Emmy Award-winning animation studio, Bento Box Entertainment. Visit [HazbinHotel.com](https://hazbinhotel.com/) through January 12 to pre-order special packages of Season 1 merch, the same-day early access to the first two episodes stream on the A24 App, with a virtual Q&A event with series creator Vivienne Medrano and other special guests.
