  "text": "Four IFES Board Members Retire After Longtime Service After years of dedicated service, four Directors retired from the Board of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) at the end of 2023. IFES is honored to recognize His Excellency Andrés Pastrana, Amb. J. Kenneth Blackwell, Thomas A. Devine, and Donald R. Sweitzer for their exceptional leadership over a combined 57 years of service. “I will always be incredibly grateful for the honor of serving on the IFES Board of Directors,” said Blackwell, who is also retiring as Board Co-Chair. “The Board is a beacon of bi-partisan collaboration for the global advancement of democratic values. I look forward to witnessing IFES’s continued impact in years to come.” Blackwell, Devine, and Sweitzer are all past IFES Board Chairs. “It has been an extraordinary privilege to work alongside such remarkable leaders,” said IFES Board Chair Amb. William C. Eacho. “As we bid a grateful farewell to these Directors, IFES will carry their legacy of service forward into the future with our continued commitment to building resilient democracies that deliver for all.” All four Directors completed their final Board terms on December 31, 2023. The Hon. M. Peter McPherson stepped into the role of Board Co-Chair effective January 1, 2024.",
