  "text": "Crispy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside, with the taste of mustard all over, these Mustard Roasted Potatoes MUST be served at your next dinner party.\nTable of Contents\nWhenever I have guests over for dinner on the weekend, I try to include dishes that are a bit unusual. It serves as a challenge to me and a surprise for my guests. Other times I prefer to take the familiar but infuse it with something different. That’s what I did with these roasted potatoes. By combining them with mustard, the fancy-dinner stalwarts have raised their game and have become—dare I say—exotic.\nAdmittedly,\nroasted potatoes need no help from me to be delicious. I love their changing textures: crispy edges give way to creamy insides. I could eat these as a snack and never get sick of them. They’re a step up from my Garlic Roasted Potatoes, as both have garlic, but this recipe has the distinct taste of mustard, which, along with the lemon, garlic, and herbs, turns these taters into something majestic.\nAre Mustard Roasted Potatoes Healthy?\nYes, Mustard Roasted Potatoes are healthy. Potatoes contain calcium, fiber, and iron, and are a great source of carbohydrates (whether this is a good thing depends on your diet). The ingredients are, for the most part, unprocessed, and should be suitable for Whole30, paleo, vegetarian, gluten-free, and Mediterranean diets. But, as always, you should double check with your personal diet and make sure.\nWhat’s So Special About Whole-Grain Mustard?\nWhole-grain mustard actually has a lot going for it. First, there’s the texture. Those grains are present in every bite, providing a delightful crunch. It also bears a more robust flavor compared to other mustards, which can sometimes lack that bite you’re after. Whole-grain mustard is also easy to make, containing few ingredients (mustard seeds, vinegar, water, salt). As a result, I sometimes think of this as a “purer” mustard. It’s also a classier mustard (if there is such a thing) and can be paired with a multitude of meats and cheeses beyond a ballpark hot dog.\nINGREDIENTS\n- 2 lb. potatoes scrubbed\n- 3 tbsp olive oil\n- ½ cup whole-grain mustard\n- ¼ cup butter, melted\n- 3 cloves garlic, crushed\n- 1 tbsp lemon zest\n- 1 tbsp lemon juice\n- 2 sprigs rosemary\n- salt and pepper\nINSTRUCTIONS\nPrep\nPreheat the oven to 350°F. Cut the potatoes into large 2-inch chunks.\nMix\nMix the olive oil, mustard, melted butter, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, rosemary leaves, and salt and pepper in a large bowl.\nCoat\nAdd the potatoes and, using a spoon, coat them with the mustard mix.\nRoast\nSpread the potatoes out on a baking sheet. Roast in the oven for 40 minutes or until the potatoes are crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.\nDEVOUR!\nTips & Tricks to Making Perfect Mustard Roasted Potatoes\n- Keep the size of the potato chunks consistent so that they cook at the same rate.\n- Line the baking sheet with parchment paper or spray it with nonstick spray.\n- If you have room, keep the potatoes from touching to ensure consistent cooking and texture.\n- Wash the potatoes with cold water, not hot water. Hot water will activate the starch and is counter to what we want to achieve by washing them in the first place (i.e., rid the potatoes of excess starch).\nFAQs\nFlipping isn’t necessary, especially if your potato pieces were all cut to the same size. If you’re particular about the roasted exterior then, by all means, flip them once halfway through cooking, but the relatively low temperature of the oven should prevent the top side of the potatoes from getting too crispy and leaving the underside under-done.\nSure, they’ll have a similar texture, though stone-ground will be slightly smoother, having had its grains milled. The taste should be close to the same, provided neither mustard added a bunch of other ingredients.\nPotatoes that hold their shape and have a waxy/creamy consistency. I usually reach for Yukon Golds or red potatoes, but fingerlings will also do the trick.\nIt’s not necessary to parboil them (the process of “pre-cooking” food) but boiling them for 8–10 minutes and then getting on with the roasting should guarantee a soft interior without leaving them in the oven too long and burning their outsides.\nVariations\nGarlic Roasted Potatoes: Roasted potatoes infused with lovely garlic, thyme, and parsley. Air-Fryer Roasted Potatoes: The roasted potatoes you love but done in an air fryer for convenience and health. Roasted Sweet Potatoes: Still roasted potatoes but slightly sweeter, creamier, and served with tahini maple. Breakfast Potatoes: Roasted potatoes but with the herbs to make them for the breakfast and brunch set.\nHow To Prep and Store Your Mustard Roasted Potatoes\nLet the potatoes cool completely, then put them in an airtight container in the fridge where they should keep for up to 4 days. To reheat, do them in the microwave or the oven set at 425°F for 10 minutes. As for freezing the potatoes, you can do so, though the texture of the potatoes may suffer. You’re better off finding a use for them before their time in the fridge expires.\nIngredients\n- 2 lb. potatoes scrubbed\n- 3 tbsp olive oil\n- ½ cup whole-grain mustard\n- ¼ cup butter melted\n- 3 cloves garlic crushed\n- 1 tbsp lemon zest\n- 1 tbsp lemon Juice\n- 2 sprigs rosemary\n- salt and pepper\nInstructions\n- Preheat the oven to 350°F.
