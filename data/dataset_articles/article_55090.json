  "text": "Complement any Mexican dish with citrus, creaminess, and aromatic infusion with a healthy helping of Avocado Cilantro Lime Rice.\nTable of Contents\nHave you assembled a table of taco treats but don’t know what to serve alongside them to make a complete meal? Or were you banking on baking burritos but want a special breed of rice to bolster them with? Well, what a coincidence! Today we’re going to make Avocado Cilantro Lime Rice—the perfect rice dish for both those occasions.\nI’ve made\nMexican Cauliflower Rice, which has the spice down pat, but the cauliflower, while supremely healthy, isn’t for everyone and every dish. I’ve also made Baked Cilantro Lime Rice, which is good but lacks the creaminess of the avocado. This recipe addresses both issues, and is ideal when concocting Mexican-oriented dishes. Whether as a side or an ingredient, it will satisfy your siestas!\nIs Avocado Cilantro Lime Rice Healthy?\nRice is fairly healthy, particularly brown rice, which contains fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Avocados are rich in heart-healthy fats, and garlic is an anti-inflammatory. Overall, it’s a great dish for anyone on vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free diets. Because rice is high in carbs, it’s not suitable for keto or low-carb diets, nor the paleo diet, which generally excludes grains.\nHow Should I Cook The Rice?\nYou have a few options these days. The obvious choice would be to use a rice cooker, the “set it and forget it” method that takes the thinking out of the process. You can also boil the rice on the stove, another straightforward procedure. If you want to try something new, why not\nbake your rice in the oven? Or, if you have one, use an Instant Pot.\nINGREDIENTS\n- 3 cups cooked brown rice\n- 2 medium avocados\n- 1 clove garlic, crushed\n- ½ tsp ground coriander\n- ½ tsp salt\n- ½ cup cilantro, chopped\n- 1 lime, juiced\nINSTRUCTIONS\nMash\nScoop the avocado flesh out of the skins and place in a bowl. Use a fork to mash it until smooth.\nAdd\nAdd the garlic, coriander, salt, cilantro, and lime juice. Stir.\nMix\nAdd the rice and mix until the rice has been coated.\nDEVOUR!\nTips & Tricks to Making Perfect Avocado Cilantro Lime Rice\n- If you’re doing the rice on the stove, leave it covered for five minutes THEN fluff. The added time will steam the rice, loosening up the grains and ensuring they are fully cooked.\n- If you still have the avocado skins intact, serve the rice inside them for a novel presentation.\n- To prevent your avocado from browning, squirt it with lime juice.\n- Use fresh lime juice. It’s healthier and tastes brighter than store-bought juices.\nFAQs\nYou don’t have to look far. Cilantro leaves, a lime wedge, or a sprinkle of ground coriander will do nicely. You may also want to add a splash of olive oil for extra flavor.\nGrilled chicken, shrimp, ground beef/pork, or black beans. Maybe some of those together?\nAdd hot sauce or red pepper flakes then give the rice a big stir.\nYou’re looking for avocados that are ripe but firm. Give them a squeeze, they should yield slightly to the pressure.\nServing Suggestions\nThe first dish that comes to mind is a\nBurrito Bowl (this recipe features cauliflower rice but you can easily replace it with this recipe). Another that comes to mind is this Cheesy Instant Pot Chicken and Rice Casserole; it’s gluten-free and oh so easy, thanks to the Instant Pot. You can also set this dish alongside Twice-Baked Mexican Sweet Potatoes if you’re open to the carbs. If not, opt for this Easy Southwest Tofu Scramble With Cauliflower Rice (again, replace the cauliflower rice with this brown-rice wonder).\nHow to Prep and Store Avocado Cilantro Lime Rice\nLet the rice cool completely then put it in an airtight container. You can keep it in the fridge for up to 2 days. The issue will be with the avocado, which browns easily, and will make the dish look unappetizing. You can also freeze the dish for up to 2 months. To reheat, you can either let it thaw in the fridge overnight or cook directly from frozen in the microwave or on the stove with a bit of water/broth.\nIngredients\n- 3 cups brown rice cooked\n- 2 medium avocados\n- 1 clove garlic crushed\n- ½ tsp ground coriander\n- ½ tsp salt\n- ½ cup cilantro chopped\n- 1 lime juice\nInstructions\n- Scoop the avocado flesh out of the skins and place it in a bowl. Use a fork to mash it until smooth.\n- Add the garlic, coriander, salt, cilantro, and lime juice. Stir.\n- Add the rice and mix until the rice has been coated.\nTips & Notes:\n- If you still have the avocado skins intact, serve the rice inside for a novel presentation.\n- To prevent your avocado from browning, squirt them with lime juice.\n- Use fresh lime juice. It’s healthier and tastes brighter than store-bought juices.\n ",
