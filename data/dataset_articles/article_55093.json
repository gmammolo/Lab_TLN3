  "text": "Make a healthy side dish with this Cilantro Lime Brown Rice recipe—its citrus taste and aromatic scent will have you drooling for more.\nTable of Contents\nLime and cilantro have a “together forever” thing going on that I just can’t get enough of. I have trouble adding one to a dish without adding the other. It’s almost Pavlovian how much I crave the aromatic flavor of cilantro whenever I taste the bright citrus that is the lime.\nI’ve featured the pair a number of times in my recipes—\nCilantro Lime Quinoa, Cilantro Lime Cauliflower Rice, Cilantro Lime Grilled Shrimp—but given the numerous times these recipes can be used as side dishes, I wanted you to have as many options as possible. Hence, this recipe, which details how you would go about making a Cilantro-and-Lime–infused brown rice.\nIs Cilantro Lime Brown Rice Healthy?\nBrown rice is in the middle ground. It’s healthier than white rice, not as healthy as cauliflower rice. It does have nutrients and fiber but is also high in carbs. It’s suitable for vegetarian, vegan (replace the butter with plant-based oil), gluten-free, and dairy-free (replace the butter) diets.\nINGREDIENTS\n- 1 ½ cups brown rice, rinsed\n- 3 cups water\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 2 cloves garlic, in their skins\n- 1 tbsp butter\n- 2 limes, juiced\n- ½ cup cilantro, chopped\nINSTRUCTIONS\nBoil\nAdd the rice, water, salt, and garlic cloves to a pot. Cover with a lid and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let sit with the lid on for another 10 minutes.\nSqueeze\nRemove the garlic from the rice. Squeeze the garlic out of the skin.\nMelt\nAdd the butter to the rice. Stir until the butter has melted.\nMix\nAdd the cilantro and lime juice and mix.\nDEVOUR!\nTips & Tricks to Making Perfect Cilantro Lime Brown Rice\n- Rinse the rice before you boil it; this will remove excess starch and prevent it from becoming too sticky.\n- For a milder, sweeter garlic flavor, consider roasting the cloves by putting them in foil with a little olive oil and warming them in the oven. Then add them to the rice, either minced or whole.\n- For more citrus, add lime zest to the rice.\n- Fluff the rice when mixing; if you stir too vigorously, you’ll damage many of the grains.\nFAQs\nSure, though brown rice is healthier. Cooking times will differ between the two varieties so consult the instructions that come with your rice.\nRinse the pot before you use it. Giving the rice the occasional stir during cooking will also help, but don’t get too stir-happy.\nYes, I recommend olive oil, which will also bring with it a slight taste variation.\nSauté bell peppers, onions, or peas then add them to the rice.\nServing Suggestions\nThis rice dish goes well with a variety of proteins.\nJuicy shrimp would taste good flavored with the lime and cilantro. You could make a casserole of sorts with this Cheesy Instant-Pot Chicken and Rice Casserole. To make a vegetarian meal, try this Easy Southwest Tofu Scramble (replace the cauliflower rice in this recipe with this brown rice). For a hearty, Mexican-inspired lunch, make a burrito bowl, with corn, onions, and peppers.\nHow to Prep and Store Cilantro Lime Brown Rice\nLet the rice cool completely then store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. You can also freeze it. And hold off adding the cilantro until you’re about to serve. Put the rice in a container or resealable freezer-safe bag. It should be okay for about 3 months. To reheat, let it thaw in the fridge overnight then cook in the microwave or stovetop with a little bit of water or broth.\nIngredients\n- 1 ½ cups brown rice rinsed\n- 3 cups water\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 2 cloves garlic in their skins\n- 1 tbsp butter\n- 2 limes juiced (+3 tbsp)\n- ½ cup cilantro chopped\nInstructions\n- Add the rice, water, salt, and garlic cloves to a pot. Cover with a lid and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let sit with the lid on for another 10 minutes.\n- Remove the garlic from the rice. Squeeze the garlic out of the skin.\n- Add the butter to the rice. Stir until the butter has melted.\n- Add the cilantro and lime juice. Mix.\nTips & Notes:\n- Rinse the rice before you boil it; this will remove excess starch and prevent it from becoming too sticky.\n- For a milder, sweeter garlic, consider roasting the cloves by putting them in foil with a little olive oil and warming them in the oven. Then add them to the rice, either minced or whole.\n- For more citrus, add lime zest to the rice.\n ",
