  "text": "Some 22 years after it first released, the cast of Max Payne recently reunited for a strange but brilliant Alan Wake 2 moment, absent one key member.\nRemedy co-founder Sam Lake captured the moment in a photo posted to X/Twitter, referring to the cast as \"family and friends.\" The group included Jani Niipola (Alex Balder), Carol Kiriakos (Mona Sax), Lake's mother and father (Nicole Horne and Alfred Woden respectively), Aki Järvilehto (BB), and of course Lake himself, who was the original face of Max Payne.\nMax Payne reunion 22 y later in Alan Wake 2. I invited family and friends to dance in the AW2 short film. @janiniipola (MP1 Alex Balder), @CarolKiriakos (MP1 Mona Sax), my mother (MP1 Nicole Horne), my father (MP1 Alfred Woden), @akijarvilehto (MP1 B.B.) @alanwake @remedygames pic.twitter.com/bVk7tvctdR\n— Sam Lake (@SamLakeRMD) January 5, 2024 Absent from the gathering was James McCaffrey, the voice of Max Payne, who died in December . His final role was Alan Wake 2, where he played Alex Casey. Lake paid tribute to McCaffrey at the time, calling him a \"lovely man and a dear friend.\"\nSpoilers for Alan Wake 2",
