  "text": "It was a great year in 2023 for the Cloverdale Rodeo, says Kathy Sheppard. During the Association’s annual AGM, Sheppard said the group enjoyed a successful return to Rodeo after three consecutive events were cancelled. (Four years passed without a Rodeo Weekend.) Sheppard, Cloverdale Rodeo & Exhibition Association (CREA) president, called the 2023 Rodeo and Country Fair “a huge success.” At the group’s AGM in the fall of 2023, two new board members were elected. Three director positions were up for election with both Rick Hugh, current 1st vice-president, and Tania Smythe, current 2nd VP, being reelected. Treasurer Michael Cook Jr. did not let his name stand and both Jen Temple and Bonnie Nicholls accepted nominations from the floor. After a tie vote, Cook called for a motion to accept both women as new directors and the motion passed. Several committee reports were submitted and approved. Sheppard submitted her president’s report, which noted the Association’s gratitude toward several volunteers and contractors that helped make Rodeo 2023 a big success. She also recognized the “very strong” relationship between the City of Surrey and CREA as instrumental in contributing to a successful rodeo. Sheppard also submitted a rodeo report. The report thanked the city and city staff “for all the extra work they dedicated to the Stetson Bowl and the facility.” Sheppard said four of five rodeo performances were sold out. Hugh submitted a report on the country fair portion of rodeo weekend. He highlighted successful events from the country fair including: the return of the Indigenous village, wrestling, skateboarding, and the AgriZone rebranded as Farm Friendz. He noted new attractions such as the Brick Corral (a Lego display), Yukon Dan, and Extreme Pogos were also a big hit with fair-goers. Hugh also submitted a report on the Cloverdale Rodeo Youth Initiative Foundation, the scholarship wing of CREA. Scott Wheatley submitted a report on publicity and media. Smythe submitted a membership and volunteer report. City councillor Mike Bose delivered the City of Surrey Report. Bose “acknowledged the amazing work done by the volunteer board of directors, the Association and the volunteers.” He also thanked Farhad Alizedeh and Kelsey Swanson and offered a “special thank you” from the City to the Association. Cook delivered both the HR report and the finance report. As part of the HR report, Cook relayed that the Human Rights Tribunal complaint “has been resolved.” He then read the official statement out loud. (That statement can be found on CREA’s website, cloverdalerodeo.com.) Cook also noted numerous HR policies have been updated. Sheppard also noted updates to the Association’s constitution are “in the final stages of edits” and will be given to members soon. The Association also recognized three people connected to the rodeo that passed away in 2023: former board member [Michael Cook Sr.](https://www.cloverdalereporter.com/obituaries/lifelong-cloverdale-man-gave-his-time-to-help-others-3091397), longtime member and volunteer Wayne Gosche, and rodeo minister Coy Huffman.",
