  "text": "You Can Now Stream This “Mesmerizing” and “Visually stunning” Masterpiece for Free\nThe wait is finally over for Adams Family Films fans. Their elusive 2023 nightmare fuel, Where the Devil Roams, is now free to watch on Tubi. This is a momentous occasion for those who missed this creepy gem in its festival run last year. If you somehow missed 2021’s Hellbender and are unfamiliar with the Adams Family values, then allow me to explain why this title has horror nerds changing their weekend plans.\nIn the film,\n“In the dregs of Depression Era America, a family of performers travels a cold, dying carnival circuit. Seven likes books; Maggie’s fond of hammers; daughter Eve’s obsessed with scissors. On a ratty stage, quiet Eve sings for their supper, but off-stage their bloody side act is booming. When the family’s bond is severed by a violent comeuppance, Eve is there to pick up the pieces. After stealing magic from a sinister Devil-dealing carny, the family’s gruesome act begins to shine. But Eve must continue to cut and sew, as the Devil guides them from below.”\nAlso Read:\nThis Tubi Documentary Exposes Catholicism’s Most Sickening Secrets\nWhere the Devil Roams was written and directed by Toby Poser, Zelda Adams, and John Adams. The movie stars Zelda Adams, Toby Poser, John Adams, Lulu Adams, and Sam Rodd.\nMany fans have already injected this disturbing film into their eyeballs and are obsessed with the aesthetic, soundtrack, and imagery. Other Adams stans are just excited to see it land on Tubi so they can finally see it.\nSee what Twitter is saying\nAlso Read:\nThe Legitmately Chilling Tubi Original You Haven’t Seen Yet: “I didn’t see that ending coming even a little bit”\nI was one of many people who never got a chance to see the movie last year. I took that personally and am happy I get to rectify that this weekend. Find me at\n@misssharai if you are also about to find Where the Devil Roams, which seems to be Tubi this month.\nCategorized:\nNews",
