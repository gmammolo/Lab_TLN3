Check out this rave review…\nWith two kids in school, the beginning of school usually breaks the bank. I’m so happy to have found this deal on glue sticks here on Amazon.\nI have enough glue sticks for each child, was able to donate a few to each teacher, and still have some left over to keep at home. I love that I was able to afford the brand name, washable, long-lasting glue sticks for less than I would have paid for the generic ones. Elmers makes the best glue sticks. They’re so effective and last a long time. They stick to paper and fabric. You won’t find a better deal anywhere!\nWould make a great school donation or just a great addition to your at-home supply cabinet.\n-\n[Shipping & Terms](#)\nAmazon Subscribe & Save\nWith Subscribe & Save, you'll score free standard shipping on auto-deliveries (non-Prime customers may incur shipping costs for the first delivery).\nYou can also cancel your subscriptions easily in your Amazon account without being penalized.
