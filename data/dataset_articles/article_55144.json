  "text": "METAIRIE, La. — New Orleans will have its first-ever king cake drive-thru starting on Saturday. A new bakery is offering locals their favorites with just a stop at the window. King Cake Drive-Thru will be a new bakery in Metairie. Owners said they hope the new drive-thru will offer locals the quick convenience of buying king cakes for Carnival season. \"Keep your kids in the car. Don’t worry about parking. Pull up and head out,\" said owner Mike Graves. \"You can grab a favorite or snag a new king cake on the way to the office or on the way home for the family.\" Expect king cakes from popular bakeries across Greater New Orleans including Brennan’s, Gambino’s, and Bittersweet Confections. Along with other favorites like Vietnamese Doughnguyener’s King Cakes, Clesi’s Crawfish King Cakes, Empanola’s Guava Cream Cheese King Cakes, and Kimi Bakes King Cake Cream Puffs. Other convenience items will be offered such as a party pack complete with plates, napkins, utensils and a king cake knife for on-the-go use. The bakery will also have a weekly rotating menu. \"If New Orleans can do drive-thru daiquiris, it surely can do a King Cake Drive-Thru,\" said Graves. King Cake Drive-Thru will have its grand opening on Saturday, Jan. 6 at 7 a.m. The bakery is located at 1009 Metairie Road in Metairie. Hours of operation will be Friday-Sunday from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. ( or until sold out) throughout Mardi Gras season. ► Get breaking news from your neighborhood delivered directly to you by downloading the new FREE WWL-TV News app now in the [IOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/new-orleans-news-from-wwl/id1453203460) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_d6bcd10196773d6203b7e9b10e53fea3&hl=en_US).",
