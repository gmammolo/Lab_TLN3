  "text": "ESPN BET Promo Code ACTNEWS: Receive $150 in Bonus Bets for Any Sporting Event All Weekend\nThe ESPN BET promo code ACTNEWS has $150 in bonus bets waiting if you're a new user betting in a legal state. The betting site requires a minimum deposit of $10, but your first wager can be any amount to access the bonus bets.\nESPN BET immediately provides five $20 bonus bet increments. The remaining $50 bonus increment appears in your account within 24-48 hours of making your first bet. The initial wager and bonus bets can be used on any sporting event this weekend and beyond, though they do expire in seven days.\nWe must reiterate the ESPN BET promo code ACTNEWS because it's required to be entered during the signup process. You won't have access to the bonus bets if you don't enter \"ACTNEWS\" during registration.\nBelow, we'll examine Friday's sports slate and offer you a strong bonus bet pick.\nUsing our ESPN BET Promo on Friday Sports\nA great aspect of the ESPN BET welcome offer is that $100 of the $150 bonus bet becomes available immediately after your first bet. You don't need to wait for the first bet to settle to access the bonus. Let's assume you have the five $20 bonus increments for Friday night's NBA slate.\nYou can tune into ESPN tonight to watch the Knicks vs. 76ers (7:30 p.m. ET) and the Grizzlies vs. Lakers (10 p.m. ET). Philadelphia is a 6.5-point favorite, while the Lakers have a 4.5-point edge.\nNeither bet works great individually for our bonus bet, but we can combine them to form a parlay. That provides us with a strong bonus bet for ESPN BET.\n- Betting Pick: 76ers ATS + Lakers ATS (+290)\nPhiladelphia received a big boost with the return of Joel Embiid on Wednesday. Embiid's first game back from injury featured his second triple-double of the season. The Lakers have been shaky since winning the NBA In-Season Tournament, but this marks a good opportunity to turn things around against the Grizzlies.\nI recommend a parlay instead of a straight bet because of the +290 odds. The\n+EV betting guide suggests wagering on any market near +300 odds for a bonus bet. This ensures you're maximizing the value of a bonus, and the potential winnings are larger than the stake.\nYou lose the bonus bet stake no matter the outcome of your wager. Therefore, if you use a $20 bonus on this parlay, you'll either have $58.10 in winnings or nothing.\nHow to Sign Up for ESPN BET\n- Go to\nESPNBET.comor the app store.\n- Sign up using all your real info, including name, birthday, home address, phone number, and last four digits of your SSN.\n- Even if you had a Penn account, sign up for a new one using your same email address, and you'll get the bonus.\n- Enter ESPN BET promo code ACTNEWS while registering\n- Make any cash wager — it can be $1, can be $100, or whatever you'd like\n- Get $150 in bonus bets, split into five $20 increments and one $50 increment.\n- Use the bonus bets in 7 days, or they'll expire.\nNew users only, 21+. Gambling problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER. Must be physically present in AZ, CO, IA, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, MI, NJ, OH, PA, TN, VA, or WV in order to wager. Players must sign up using a specified Promotion code and then place an Eligible Wager on an Eligible Game during the Promotion Period. $150 (five (5) $20 Increments) of the $150 in Bonus Bets will be credited upon making the first bet.
