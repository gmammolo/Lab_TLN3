  "text": "Consumer court holds Railways accountable for a delay that cost a student an entire academic year Seven years after a delayed train cost her a crucial entrance examination, a student from Uttar Pradesh’s Basti district has finally received justice. The district consumer disputes redressal commission has ordered the Railways to pay ₹9.10 lakh in compensation to Samriddhi, who missed her BSc Biotechnology entrance exam in 2018 because her train arrived more than two hours late.\nThe case has drawn attention for its rare acknowledgment of how transport delays can have life-altering consequences, especially for students whose academic futures depend on strict schedules.\nThe incident dates back to May 7, 2018, when Samriddhi, then 17 years old, was travelling from Basti to Lucknow to appear for the entrance examination for a BSc Biotechnology course. Her examination centre was Jai Narayan PG College in Lucknow, and candidates were required to report by 12.30 pm. She had planned her journey carefully, booking a seat on the Gorakhpur–Lucknow Intercity Superfast Express, which was scheduled to reach Lucknow at 11 am.\nHowever, the train arrived around two-and-a-half hours late, leaving her with no possible way to reach the examination centre on time. By the time she reached Lucknow, the reporting window had already closed, and she was denied entry to the exam hall. A full year of academic preparation was rendered meaningless in a single morning.\nDistressed by the loss of an entire academic opportunity, Samriddhi approached the district consumer commission, filing a claim of ₹20 lakh against the Railways. Notices were sent to the Railway Ministry, the general manager, and the station superintendent. Despite acknowledging the delay, the Railways failed to provide any convincing justification for it or explain why such a critical service failure had occurred.\nAfter a prolonged legal battle that lasted more than seven years, the consumer commission ruled in Samriddhi’s favour. The court held that the Railways had failed to provide timely and reliable service, which directly resulted in irreparable academic and emotional loss to the student.\nThe commission directed the Railways to pay ₹9.10 lakh as compensation within 45 days. It also stated that if the amount is not paid within this period, it will attract an additional interest of 12 percent.\nSamriddhi’s lawyer, Prabhakar Mishra, said the judgment recognises that the loss she suffered was not merely emotional but also academic and professional. Missing the exam meant losing an entire year, disrupting career plans, and enduring prolonged mental stress. He added that the Railways admitted the delay but could not justify it, which played a key role in the court’s decision.\nThis verdict has sparked wider discussion about passenger rights and accountability. Train delays are often treated as routine inconveniences, but this case highlights how they can have severe consequences, particularly when linked to time-bound commitments such as exams, interviews, or medical emergencies.\nFor students, whose futures depend heavily on competitive examinations, even a short delay can mean losing opportunities that cannot be recovered. The ruling sends a clear message that public service providers cannot treat punctuality as optional, especially when people rely on their services for critical life events.\nThe case is also being seen as a strong reminder that consumers have the right to seek accountability from large institutions. It shows that persistence in the legal system, even when slow, can lead to meaningful justice.",
