  "text": "Today's 98.3 TRY Social Dilemma came from Jerry and it's about Dry January and JanuHairy. Here's his email: Hi Jaime I have a dilemma for you. My wife has asked me to participate in Dry January this month, and I told her I would....under one condition. I want her to participate in JanuHairy. We all know dry January means no drinking for the month, but in case you hadn't heard of JanuHairy, it means that women don't shave for the month...not under their arms or their legs. Apparently it's supposed to show that hair on women is beautiful, and I happen to think it is. I also happen to think that if I have to do something that's uncomfortable for me, like stay dry for the month, then she should do something that's uncomfortable for her, like not shave her legs, etc. This is a woman who shaves every single day. So what do you think? Isn't that a fair trade-off? I think not drinking is MUCH harder than not shaving for a month. Hope you and your listeners can help convince her of that. Thanks ~ Jerry. Wow, this is a dilemma on so many levels. First off, I think if you are going to do something, it should be because you want to, not because someone is pushing you to do it. And if Jerry wants to do dry January, then it should have nothing to do with his wife's hair. But that's just my take. What do you think? Let's help Jerry out and let me know on the TRY Facebook page.\nPhoto: OntheRunPhoto / iStock / Getty Images",
