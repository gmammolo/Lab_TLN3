  "text": "States » EastPosted at: Jan 29 2026 7:14PM Farewell parade: Retiring officiating DGP Rajeev Kumar calls courage police's greatest strengthKolkata, Jan 29 (UNI) Director General of Police (DGP) of West Bengal Rajeev Kumar, one of the most colourful and controversial figures in the state police in recent times, today delivered a strong message on courage, resolve and duty while addressing a farewell parade at the Alipore Bodyguard Lines, two days ahead of his scheduled retirement on January 31.Currently serving as the officiating or temporary DGP, Kumar praised the state and Kolkata Police for their professionalism and commitment, and urged personnel to remain steadfast in difficult situations. Addressing police personnel and their families, he underlined the core values that, according to him, define the force and shape public expectations from it. \"The first quality of a police force is courage. Very often, we face extremely difficult situations and serious challenges. If we can show true courage in such moments, we can overcome any challenge,\" Kumar said in his address. Explaining what he meant by courage, the officiating DGP said, \"Courage means standing your ground and remaining firm in your decisions.\" Pointing out the unique geographical and strategic challenges faced by the West Bengal Police, Kumar said, \"The state shares international borders with three countries — Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh — making it particularly sensitive to regional and geopolitical developments.\" \"West Bengal is the most strategically and geopolitically important state. There is no other state in India that shares borders with three countries. Whatever happens in neighbouring countries or even in the northeastern states has a direct impact on West Bengal,\" he pointed. Despite these challenges, Kumar said the state and Kolkata Police have consistently discharged their duties with distinction. Whether it is maintaining law and order or fulfilling broader social responsibilities, the police force in West Bengal always stood out, he asserted. \"Talk is not as important as work. You are one of the best police forces in the country. But this has to be maintained through action, not words,\" Kumar told the personnel. Referring to the force's handling of the Maoist challenge in the past, Kumar praised the police for their operational effectiveness. He also highlighted the management of large-scale events and festivals such as Durga Puja and the Gangasagar Mela, saying the manner in which the police control crowds and maintain order during such massive gatherings is a matter of pride. \"In many places, such events have resulted in loss of lives. But the way our police manage these festivals and maintain law and order makes us proud,\" he said. Kumar also acknowledged the contribution of all ranks within the police system, stressing that senior officers alone cannot claim credit for the force's achievements. \"Just as senior officers contribute, home guards and civic volunteers contribute equally. We are a family, and our strength lies in staying united,\" he added. Kumar's farewell comes amid ongoing uncertainty over the appointment of a permanent DGP in the state. West Bengal currently does not have a full-time DGP, with Kumar continuing in an officiating capacity. Although he is due to retire on January 31, his name has been included in the list of officers sent by the state government to the Centre for consideration for the post of DGP. As per rules, the union Public Service Commission (UPSC) prepares a panel of three senior IPS officers from names forwarded by the state government, from which the state selects one for appointment as DGP. Apart from Kumar, the list sent by the state includes IPS officers Rajesh, Ranbir Kumar, Debashis Ray, Anuj Sharma, Jagmohan, N Ramesh Babu and Siddhinath Gupta. The last permanent DGP of West Bengal was Manoj Malviya, who retired in December 2023. According to norms, the panel of eligible officers should have been sent to the UPSC at least three months before his retirement. However, the list was sent on December 27, 2023, leading to legal complications. The UPSC later returned the panel, citing procedural delays, and a permanent appointment has since remained pending.
