  "text": "Sales of dartboards have soared since teenager Luke Littler took the sport by storm.\nRetailer The Range said 10 separate product types sold out in the past two weeks. Luke’s favourite nosh also got a boost with Iceland recording a 25% jump in sales of its Grill House Frozen Doner Kebabs. A Range spokesman said: “The teenager’s debut has prompted an unprecedented rise in dartboard sales. Many of our LED ones, which clock the scores, have already sold out and we are doing our best to restock.”\nArgos said dartboards were flying off its shelves too. Visits to its website for darts and boards increased by 40% year-on-year following the PDC World Darts ­Championship final . John Lewis said searches on its site for darts were up nearly 30% over the course of the Championship in comparison to the month before it began on December 15.\nCommenting on the kebab sales rise, an Iceland spokeswoman said: “We’ve not seen a sporting star influence sales like this for a long time.”\nOn Wednesday, Luke, 16, lost the final to Luke Humphries, 28, at London’s Alexandra Palace, but he netted £200,000 in prize money.",
