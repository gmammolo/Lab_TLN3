  "text": "Austin, TX - Estate jewelry includes items with a rich history, having been previously owned and passed down through generations. Typically acquired after a previous owner has passed away, these pieces often hail from eras such as Victorian, Arts and Crafts, Georgian, or Art Deco/Nouveau.\nEven though every piece of estate jewelry differs, they are usually high-quality items with personal style characteristics that have withstood the test of time. In addition to the fact that only the finest and most durable pieces survive, many lesser-quality items break apart or deconstruct to fit changing jewelry styles, contributing to the design of estate and antique trinkets.\nAbercrombie Jewelry, specializing in buying and selling estate jewelry, excels in appraising and acquiring these valuable pieces, ensuring fair valuations.
