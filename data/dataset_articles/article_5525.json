  "text": "In Punjab, the Border Security Force (BSF), in coordination with the Punjab Police have recovered a large consignment of arms and ammunition along with narcotics in two separate operations at Fazilka and Amritsar. According to police sources, 4 hand grenades, 22 pistols, 356 live rounds and over 45 kilogram heroin have been recovered in both operations. At Fazilka, Pakistan-based smugglers crossed the zero line and operated close to the border fence, taking advantage of the night conditions and dense fog to push arms and narcotics into Indian territory. Alert BSF troops fired several rounds to prevent the breach, followed by a thorough joint search operation leading to the recovery. 20 pistols and one MP-5 pistol, 310 live cartridges and over 2 kilogram heroin had been recovered from the spot. Whereas, in Amritsar, 4 hand grenades, 43 kilogram heroin, one pistol and 46 live rounds have been recovered from two persons. The village Defence Committee played a pivotal role by helping the police in the recovery and the arrest.",
