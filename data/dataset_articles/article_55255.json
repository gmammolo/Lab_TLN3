  "text": "Indiana again ranked among ‘Best States to Start a Business’ Forbes is out with its 2024 list of “The Best States to Start a Business,” and Indiana has fallen from its previous No. 1 position. The annual ranking is determined by evaluating each state on multiple metrics across five categories. The categories are business costs, business climate, financial accessibility, economy, and workforce. The states are given a score scaled out of 100 based on each metric. Indiana, which landed the top spot last year, has fallen to No. 2 for 2024, behind only North Dakota. Forbes noted Indiana’s business-friendly environment and what it calls a solid business survival rate of 77″, which reflects “a stable and nurturing environment for business growth.” The publication also cited a supportive financial environment for entrepreneurs and a lower-than-average cost of living. “All these factors contribute to Indiana’s impressive scaled score of 98 out of 100, making it an excellent choice for business ventures,” Forbes said. The top five states are rounded out by Arkansas, South Dakota, and North Carolina.
