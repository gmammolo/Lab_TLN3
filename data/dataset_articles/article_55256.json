  "text": "Friday, January 5th 2024, 3:28 pm For those looking for an escape from the cold, the Oklahoma Boat Expo is in Tulsa this weekend. With more than 200 lakes, Oklahoma is a lake lover's paradise. \"Everybody knows around Tulsa there are lakes everywhere and so the show has really been embraced by Tulsa and beyond Tulsa,\" said show coordinator Don Miner.

In its third year in Tulsa, the Oklahoma Boat Expo has more boat dealers than ever before with 18 different ones from all over Oklahoma in attendance. \"Hands down this is the biggest boat show in Oklahoma, period,\" Miner continued saying, \"There are more boat dealers here this weekend than there will be at any other show in Oklahoma this year.\" While the boats are the main attraction there is also something for the outdoorsman. Miner said, \"There is personal watercraft, there is side by sides, there is motorcycles, there is kayaks, and everything for the outdoors here.\" Making this weekend the perfect opportunity to buy before it warms up and the prices shoot up. Tickets for the Oklahoma Boat Expo are $12 at the door and free for children 12 and under. QuikTrip locations in the Tulsa metro also have a coupon for $2 off. Miner said, \"You buy a ticket for our show, and you can come back all three days, the ticket is good for the entire show.\" January 5th, 2024 January 5th, 2024 January 5th, 2024 January 5th, 2024 January 5th, 2024 January 5th, 2024 January 5th, 2024",
