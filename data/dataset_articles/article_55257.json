  "text": "Why January is the best time to start planning your 2024 travel BRYAN, Texas (KBTX) - Whether you’re preparing to pack your bags now, in the summertime, or for the holidays, Certified Travel Advisor [Brooke Harrington](https://www.harringtontravelco.com/) recommends starting the planning process in January. Harrington says it’s cheaper the earlier in the year you start the process. “I actually just got off the phone with a client that’s looking at December,” Harrington said. “I was like ‘you’re absolutely going to get the best price point planning in January looking forward to December.” Harrington said if you’re not sure of where you’d like to travel yet in 2024, a travel advisor can help you choose. On the other hand, if you know exactly where you’re headed, they can help you choose the best accommodations. “What travel advisors really bring to the table is first-hand destination knowledge,” Harrington said. “I specialize in the Caribbean and Mexico.” Harrington said booking with a travel advisor can eliminate a lot of the stress that can come with planning a trip. She said not all hotels and properties are created equal, so an agent can make sure you’re getting a quality place for the best price. Harrington also said it’s best to plan early because you have a lot more options on what you can do, and there is more availability on activities and tours for your itinerary. Copyright 2024 KBTX.
