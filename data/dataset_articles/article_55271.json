From surfing in Norway and rhino conversation to rock climbing in Afghanistan and gravel biking in East Tennessee, these movies will take you on a different adventure with each new title screen. Lineup The festival will showcase 60+ films (shorts and features) — check out the [full lineup](https://lwff.org/films/) for each day.
