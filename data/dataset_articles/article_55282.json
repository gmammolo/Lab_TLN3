  "text": "A former Real Housewives of Dallas star has revealed what to expect inside that big orange box when she takes home an expensive Hermès Birkin bag, if she’s ever that lucky. The peek behind the luxurious curtain was shared on TikTok last month by Dr. Tiffany Moon, who works as a certified anesthesiologist and is founder of the fragrance company Aromasthesia Candles. In 2021, the doctor admitted that she considered herself a ‘connoisseur’ of Hermès bags during an interview with Glamor Magazine since it has an extensive collection of them in different shapes, sizes, colors, materials and skins. Birkins are notoriously some of the hardest bags to get your hands on, as they are made in extremely limited quantities and supposedly only offered to those customers who have an extensive purchasing history with the brand. Anesthesiologist Dr. Tiffany Moon took to TikTok last month and revealed exactly what comes in the box when you buy an Hermès Birkin bag. She showed viewers each item that comes in the box along with the expensive purchase. in the video Dr. Moon, who uses the username @TiffanyMoonMD online, she went over all the perks that come with Birkin, while showing viewers her hot pink Birkin 25 bag in matte crocodile and Rose Extreme color. “These are all things you should get when you buy a new Birkin bag,” Moon said. “It should come in a nice box, with a little pillow to rest your Birkin on,” she explained, stroking the small white pillow resting inside the orange box. Next, he said, the bag should come with a piece of protective felt that fits the top of the bag. It also includes a tape on the outside of the bag, as well as a series of protective dust bags. “A dust bag for your purse, and then a dust bag for your key, clochette, and lock to match your bag,” Dr. Moon said, showing viewers the various cases made of fabric that They come with the purchase. However, Dr. Moon told DailyMail.com that she didn’t use the dust bags that come with the bags for one particular reason. “I don’t use the dust bag to store my bags because I have doors on my closet to keep dust out and I like to be able to see all my bags,” Dr. Moon told DailyMail.com. At the beginning of the clip, Dr. Moon explained that the bag came with a small pillow that was inside the box. Not only does the Birkin bag come with its own dust bag, but it also comes with a smaller one for bag accessories. In the past, the fragrance founder let onlookers into her drool-worthy closet, which features several Hermès handbags. The bag Dr. Moon showed off in the video was a Birkin 25 bag in matte alligator. She also revealed that the bags used to come with their own raincoat, but that was no longer something the brand seemed to do. “Also, until recently, all my Birkin bags came with a raincoat, but I’ve never used it, so I have dozens of them,” she added. “I guess that’s why they stopped including them, because no one really uses them.” Each Birkin bag requires a minimum of 18 hours of artisanal production, according to Sotheby’s and each piece comes with a “unique code” that provides buyers with the year it was created and the artisan behind it. A leather Birkin typically sells for around $10,000, according to the auction house, and is the famous brand’s “most sought after” bag. Dr Moon told DailyMail.com that her first Birkin bag was a 35cm black Togo with gold hardware that she bought in 2008. It was a gift to herself after graduating from medical school. “It’s a classic and I feel like a great ‘beginner’ Birkin because it goes with everything and you can dress it up or down,” Dr. Moon revealed. She also explained to viewers the receipts that accompanied the expensive purchase, including a summons certificate for the exotic handbags. In 2020, Moon and her six-year-old twin daughters, Chloe and Madison, now 9, even dressed up as Birkin bags for a Halloween celebration. During a 2021 interview, Dr. Moon admitted she was a ‘connoisseur’ of Hermès bags “The receipt, of course,” Dr. Moon said, holding up the piece of paper. ‘If it is exotic, you need a CITES and this paper which is a brochure that says something in French. That’s all.’ The TV personality told DailyMail.com that it was very important to make sure you took proper care of your bag. “If you want to protect your investment, I recommend that you store it in the closet, away from direct sunlight,” he explained. “Some people choose to put on the dust bag and store it there or inside the box, but I find it too cumbersome.” Tiffany also offered some tips for those looking to get their hands on their own Hermès Birkin. “I get asked this all the time and there is no magic answer,” Dr Moon told DailyMail.com. “The best way is to establish a relationship with your local Hermès store and limit yourself to 1 SA (sales associate).” In the comments section of her video, many users seemed excited to learn more about the bag. ‘There are stories of people with no purchasing history who simply walked in and bought a Birkin, but that is extremely rare. “Hermès likes to see that you are a fan of the brand and purchase other items before offering a quota bag (Birkin or Kelly).” In the comments section, many users fantasized about the day they could get their hands on one of the bags. ‘Will I ever get a Birkin? No. Did I still watch this video twice? Obviously,” one person wrote. Another person agreed: “I want to be you when I grow up.” “I love bag school with Tiffany,” someone else wrote.",
