  "text": "A bipartisan pair of lawmakers has introduced legislation aimed at curbing law enforcement staffing shortages by offering a federal tax break to officers.\nCongressman Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican, and Congresswoman Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Democrat from Washington, unveiled the “Fuel the Force Act” earlier this month during a gathering with 30 law enforcement members and union representatives.\nThe bill would allow full-time officers with at least five years of service to exclude the first $100,000 of their ordinary income from federal income tax annually.\nThe proposal is specifically designed to bolster recruitment and retention and targets the five-year mark that many departments identify as a critical point for officer attrition, according to the lawmakers.\n“The need for professional, exceptional law enforcement has never been greater — and the dangers our officers face have never been more real,” said Fitzpatrick, a former FBI special agent. “These men and women stand on the front lines of that challenge, not for glory or recognition, but out of an unshakable sense of duty.”\nThe bill’s tax break eligibility is broad, covering federal, state, and local roles. It includes police, corrections, probation, parole, judicial, sheriffs, and school resource officers.\nThe congressman’s office said on its website that the relief is delivered directly through the tax code.\nGluesenkamp Perez said the bill was sparked by reports of officers struggling to make ends meet.\n“Last year, during Police Week, law enforcement officers told me that they had colleagues living on food stamps,” she said. “Departments do their best work when they’re able to build durable connections with the folks they serve. Those relationships take time to develop, so whenever a recruit leaves things go back to square one.”\nThe legislation was developed following consultations with law enforcement and Bucks County resident Christina Nelson, the founder of the national nonprofit Fuel the Force, which supports police.\n“Officers across the country are carrying heavier workloads with fewer resources, and too many are being pushed out at the point in their careers when their experience matters most,” Nelson said.\nThe bill has gained the backing of the Fraternal Order of Police and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association.\nMiddletown Township Chief of Police Joseph Bartorilla, who also serves as president of the Bucks County Police Chiefs Association, praised the proposal for turning concerns into “pro-law-enforcement solutions.”\nAccording to May 2023 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for police officers nationwide was $72,228. In Bucks County, state data shows the median wage is $101,980 for officers and $133,140 for supervisors.\nAccording to data from the Bucks County District Attorney’s Office, there are more than 900 law enforcement officials in the county and roughly 40 agencies.",
