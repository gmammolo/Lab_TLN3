Last season, the Rockets blanked the Oil Kings at Rogers Place on February 24, 2023 by a 4-0 score. The Rockets goals were supplied by Dylan Wightman(2), former Oil King Carson Golder and Trae Johnson. Talyn Boyko stopped all 27 shots he faced in the Rockets cage while Logan Cunningham turned away 36 of the 40 shots sent his direction. The Oil Kings last visit to Prospera Place was 1,501 days ago on November 26, 2019 a game in which they secured a 1-0 win via the shootout. Sebastian Cossa, 21 saves, and Roman Basran, 27 saves, were the two goalies of record to pick up the rare double shutout. Dylan Guenther scored the lone goal in the shootout. The Oil Kings and Rockets have met 27 times total in the regular season with eight of those games being decided in the shootout with both teams having four wins apiece in the skills competition. Coming In The Oil Kings come in riding a six-game point streak (5-0-1-0) and have back-to-back wins following a 3-1 win Wednesday night in Kamloops. Landon Hanson opened the scoring for Edmonton with a beautiful coast-to-coast rush late in the first period while Gracyn Sawchyn, who now has at least a point in all four games as an Oil King, scored a pair of goals setup by Ty Nash. Kolby Hay, playing in his 100th career WHL game and first in his virtual hometown of Kamloops, came within 90 seconds of picking up a shutout but still finished the night as the game’s first start after stopping 36 of 37 shots for his fifth consecutive victory in the Edmonton crease. The Rockets come in having won two straight games and four of their last five after a wild 7-6 win over the Calgary Hitmen on Saturday. Since November 21, 2023 the Rockets hold a record of 10-4-0-0. Their last five games have all been decided by two goals or less.
