The pair are now set to enjoy an all-expenses paid Italian honeymoon but said they plan to take a shorter break first. Nist and Turner have enjoyed a whirlwind romance since meeting just over three months ago – before marrying live on ABC in a sunset Thursday night ceremony. The ceremony, which included multiple Bachelor Nation guests, saw financial services professional Nist arrive on the arm of son Tommy, 46, accompanied by her new stepdaughters Angie Warner, 43, and Jenny Young, 49, along with Turner's granddaughters Charlee, 16, and Payton, 22. For her big day, she plumped for an ivory tulle gown designed by New York fashion house Badgley Mishka and styled the dress with a white veil and a simple pair of gold satin sandals. Turner, meanwhile, was smartly dressed in a neat black tuxedo and was flanked by his groomsmen including his best man – son-in-law Rob, 44. Both became tearful as they read out their handwritten vows, with Turner telling Nist: 'Theresa when I think of all the decisions that we have made to be here in this position tonight, I know the hand of God and the winds of fate have ordained this moment. 'From our first sip of chocolate shake to the last taste of Costa Rican coffee, I have learned that you are the woman I can't live without. 'I learned that you make me calm with the touch of your hand. I've learned that you make me laugh with the easy comfort of a long-lost friend.' After being declared man and wife by officiant and Golden Bachelor contestant Susan Noles, 66, the pair enjoyed a kiss to cheers from their guests under a rose arch constructed for the ceremony. Gerry and Theresa raised their arms triumphantly after being named husband and wife Gerry kissed his bride Theresa during the live wedding ceremony Theresa got emotional during the wedding ceremony as she talked about finding love late in life Gerry looked into Theresa's eyes while saying his wedding vows to her The Coachella Valley wedding was the finale to ABC's Golden Bachelor series – itself a spinoff from the popular Bachelor and Bachelorette franchises. Like its sister shows, the Golden Bachelor hasn't been without controversy after Indiana 'retired restaurateur' Turner was revealed to be a hot tub maintenance man who sold his last restaurant – a hamburger joint named Mr Quick – in 1985. And despite claiming to have been single since Toni, his wife of 43-years, died unexpectedly in 2017, Turner has, in fact, dated multiple women – even dumping one ex-girlfriend in January 2020 after she allegedly gained weight. Even his romance with Nist didn't go entirely to plan, with a blubbering Turner almost handing the rose to runner-up Leslie Fhima, 64. Ahead of the big reveal, which was screened on November 30, Turner spent one night each with Nist and Fhima – separately telling each woman she is 'the one'. After finally plumping for Nist, a sobbing Turner said of Fhima: 'The only time I've felt this bad in my life is when my wife died and this comes a goddamn close second.' He added: 'I took a really good person and broke her heart.' Despite the drama, the couple have finally got their happy ending, with both looking blissful following the nuptials. The Golden Wedding appropriately took place in the retirement golf haven of La Quinta Resort & Club in La Quinta, California, 25 miles South of Palm Springs On Thursday night, the pair were seen partying with their guests at their reception which included a choice of two wedding cakes – a vanilla, chocolate and cappuccino confection picked by Turner and a lemon and raspberry number chosen by Nist. Dinner began with a selection of appetizers served with cocktails while entrées included steak and halibut as well as a vegetarian option. The Coachella Valley resort of La Quinta has previously hosted Bachelor contestants, with the 2020 season of the Bachelorette also shot at the La Quinta Resort and Club. The 2019 season was also filmed in La Quinta at the Hyatt Regency while in 2003, the resort's Ritz-Carlton hotel was the venue for the first wedding to happen as a result of the franchise. As well as its long association with the Bachelor, the La Quinta Resort and Club also has a storied Hollywood history – including being the spot where director Frank Capra wrote the screenplay for classic adventure movie, Lost Horizon, poolside in 1937. The property is also home to a PGA golf course while La Quinta itself has been dubbed 'the golf capital of the world' due to its smorgasbord of top-class courses. As a result, the hotel has repeatedly welcomed celebrity visitors, among them Kevin Costner, Justin Bieber, Eddie Murphy, Drew Barrymore and Susan Sarandon.",
