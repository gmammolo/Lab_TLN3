  "text": "This short-lived Black Friday deal is back. Best Buy currently has the massive 77\" LG G2 \"Gallery Series\" 4K OLED Smart TV for only $2474.99. This is a clearance item so availability may depend on your region. If you're looking for a gorgeous 77\" TV that delivers a stunning picture while seamlessly blending into your home decor, then this TV should be on your radar.\n77\" LG G2 Gallery Series 4K OLED TV for $2474.99\nThe LG G2 was LG's highest end TV of 2022. This model sits above the C2 in the LG OLED hierarchy. The G2 is dubbed the \"Gallery series\" because of one important attribute: the G2 is built from the ground up to be wall-mounted, and to that end, a wall mount is included instead of a stand. The G2 sits perfectly flush to the wall when mounted. The C2 has a big bulge at the bottom of its cabinet and so it cannot be flush mounted in the same way. Iif you plan on wall mounting your TV, the G2 is the better looking option.\nThe G2 also boasts a 20% brighter panel compared to the Evo C2. This year's C3 model has made improvements to the brightness, but the G2 is still brighter than even the C3 (you'd have to step up to the G3 to get anything better). OLEDs are perfect in almost every way except for the brightness; they are generally less bright than traditional LED LCD TVs. That's why every improvement matters a lot for an OLED TV. A brighter TV means better dynamic range for HDR, but it also means the picture is less likely to be washed out in brightly lit or sun-filled rooms with poor light control.\nAside from that, the G2 is similar to most other true OLED TVs. Compared to traditional LED LCD TVs, OLED TVs offer better image quality, deeper blacks, better contrast ratio, wider color gamut, and super fast response times. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV are easily the best type of TV for viewing 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. LG OLED TVs particular have been out for years and benefit from several generations of optimizations. The first LG OLED TV (a 55\" model) was released back in 2010, well before other manufacturers introduced their own consumer-ready TVs to the market.\nIn addition to the OLED technology, the LG G2 has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV as well. It has a native 120Hz panel and all four HDMI 2.1 ports for running 4K at 120Hz on a PS5 or Xbox Series X. It also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM).",
