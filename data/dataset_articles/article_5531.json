  "text": "TENKASI: The Tenkasi District Police have solved 44 missing cases in just 72 hours. They have rescued 45 missing men, women and children and reunited them with their distraught families.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Superintendent of Police G. S. Madhavan, who assumed office 27 days ago, asked the Station House Officers of all police stations in the district to submit comprehensive reports on unsolved ‘missing cases’.\nAs per the report submitted by the Station House Officers, 44 missing cases had been filed in 20 police stations. Cases pertained to tracing 28 women, 10 men, six girls and one male child. These cases had been filed owing to a range of reasons, including domestic violence, going underground after being unable to repay loans, differences of opinion between couples and children and their parents, elopement, leaving the family after the children refuse to take care of the father or mother etc.\nMr. Madhavan, upon receiving the reports, formed special teams in each police station to trace the whereabouts of the missing even as the Deputy Superintendents of Police of each sub-division were asked to monitor the daily progress of investigation about each case and update the Superintendent of Police about the progress.\nSign up for free and get curated news updates LOG IN Support our reporting.
