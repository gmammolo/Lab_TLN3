  "text": "Kentucky Wedding Show helping couples plan at The Henry Clay this weekend With so much to get organized, planning a wedding can be challenging. Dress shopping and chocolate fountains This Saturday, the Louisville Wedding Network looks to give engaged couples a leg up on planning when they hold the [Kentucky Wedding Show](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/kentucky-wedding-show-at-the-henry-clay-tickets-745743578117) at the Henry Clay. Don't forget the flowers The show features more than 60 local vendors with different wedding specialties. President of the Louisville Wedding Network Jamie Lott thinks keeping your planning local can relieve stress. Wedding cakes and the bar \"If you hire me, you get me,\" Lott said. \"If you hire a videographer, you get them, they are local vendors.\" Wedding planning with Jamie Lott Also a wedding planner, Lott tells WLKY that the average Louisville wedding costs between $30,000 and $40,000. That expense and expectation can put couples under stress; Lott gives the same advice to all her clients. \"I always remind the couple that this process is amazing,\" Lott said. \"But this wedding is about their marriage, their life together, not just about the wedding,\" Backdrops and music The Kentucky Wedding Show is either $10 at the door or free if you register in advance. It runs from 1-4:30 p.m.",
