  "text": "Leanna Madden from JohnSlots Shares Insights on the Importance of Online Slots Review\nHow many times have you taken a look at a product online and thought, yeah, I’ll get that, only to find a number of bad reviews advising you to steer away?\nWith the sheer number of products and services available on the internet, it’s impossible to know if something is good or bad from the description alone.\nOnline reviews are not only handy, they’re necessary to make wise purchasing decisions.\nOnline Slot Reviews\nThis is especially true when it comes to the iGaming scene. With the industry projected to hit nearly $160 billion by 2030, the competition between online casinos is fierce, and one of the biggest factors in their success is the quantity of games that they offer.\nIn 2024, the average online casino has hundreds of slot games for customers to choose from, and if there were no online slot reviews, it would only get harder for a customer to pick the best ones for them.\nWith this in mind, we recently had a talk with\nan online slot authority Leanna Madden from Johnslots. Being deeply involved in the intricacies of the industry, Leanna walked us through the importance of online reviews for customers, and why they’re so crucial for the casinos themselves.\nThe Importance of Trust\nFirst off, Leanna talked to us about finding trusted online slot reviews and why it is important to do so.\n‘At Johnslots, it’s my job to analyse a vast number of slots everyday, offering valuable insights for players based on RTP, volatility, themes, and gameplay. I can do this because I have a pulse on the industry. I know what it takes to make a good slot and, being so involved in the iGaming community, I understand what a wide range of players want to experience.\n‘But this isn’t the case for every slot reviewer. When reading a review, it’s important to know that it’s from a trusted source. It’s so hard to know when you’re behind a screen, but there are several ill-informed or fake reviews out there that are not posted for your benefit.\n‘Also, like I said before, I know what a good slot looks like, and my insights always cover everything you need to know. You need to make sure the reviews that you read are comprehensive, and cover a range of slot features, both positive and negative. Detail. That’s the key.’\nThe Meaning Behind RTP\nWe then asked Leanna about RTP, which seems to be one of the biggest factors in a user’s decision to play.\n‘It is, yes. That’s the first thing that the user will take into account when they come across a review, and the details will be filled in later. You always want to go for the best RTP slots – the ones that offer the best chances of winning and maximising payouts.\n‘But you also need to match this with your own risk preferences. The best reviews will talk about slot machine volatility, and will compare a slot in accordance to the slot machine volatility chart. Of course, we all want a high RTP. But how much are you willing to risk for larger payouts? A review will give you all the necessary information so that you can make informed decisions.’\nThemes and Gameplay\nOn a basic level, we also understand that online slot reviews are there to inform players about the gameplay and themes of the slot itself, and this is something we brought to Leanna at the end of our conversation.\n‘Yes,’ Leanna agreed with us. ‘If you’re browsing an online casino, you’re going to come across hundreds of slots, each one of which is advertised with a single, eye-catching image. They all look great, right? But it’s hard to really capture what you’re in for from a single image.\n‘An online slot review can give you a good indication without the player having to make a deposit in the first place. Let’s say you like history-themed games with a great soundtrack and fast, snappy gameplay. You’re not going to know that from a single image, so you need to read a good, comprehensive review to understand what you’re getting.\n‘You might also need the review to get to grips with the game itself! Not every slot is the same, so it can be helpful to read a review for guidance and to learn any winning strategies. But again, you have to trust the review first. If you do that, then you’ll find the game for you in no time at all, I’m sure of it!’\nGambling can be addictive, please play responsibly. Click\nHERE for more info.",
