  "text": "With this Crescent Lasagna recipe you get all the flavors of lasagna between flaky layers of crescent roll dough. A meaty meat sauce and cream cheese layer are sandwiched between layers of buttery crescent dough to make an unbelievably delicious family meal.\nCrescent Roll Dough\nThis recipe makes use of one of my favorite kitchen shortcuts- refrigerated Crescent Roll Dough. I use Pillsbury Crescent Roll Dough. You can use either the crescent dough or crescent sheets. If using crescent dough, you will have to press on the perforations to seal them. I also love to use crescent dough to make these\nSloppy Joe Squares, Crescent Beef Burritos, and Sausage and Crescent Roll Casserole.\nMeat Filling\nA super thick tomato meat sauce, with both ground beef and Italian sausage for supreme flavor, is spread on top of a rectangle of crescent roll dough.\nCheese Filling\nNext comes a cheese mixture made from cottage cheese, 2 eggs, and Parmesan cheese. If you don’t like cottage cheese, use ricotta cheese. I think using cottage cheese for a lasagna is a southern thing. But even if you think you don’t like cottage cheese, try it for lasagna. It is super, super creamy.\nA thick layer of shredded mozzarella cheese comes next and then a second can of crescent roll dough is unrolled and placed on top.\nThe only slightly tricky part of this recipe is getting the top and bottom layers of crescent roll dough sealed around the edges. And it’s difficult to get it perfectly shaped.\nBut with a meal that tastes this yummy, does it really matter what it looks like?\nVariations and Substitutions\n- Use all ground beef or all Italian sausage.\n- Use ground turkey to make it a little lighter.\n- Make it spicy. Add half a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes.\n- Sub ricotta cheese for cottage cheese.\n- Add sauteed mushrooms.\nCan Crescent Lasagna Be Frozen?\nYes! Bake the lasagna and let it cool completely. Wrap it in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 3 months.\nMeat sauce, gooey cheese, and buttery dough is always a winning combination!\nNever miss a recipe.
