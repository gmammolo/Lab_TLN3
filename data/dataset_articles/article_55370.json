There's just something about a comforting casserole that warms us from the inside out. Inspired by this easy\nchicken and tomato casserole recipe, this cheesy chicken and peppers pasta casserole recipe is pure comfort food.\nBut this easy\ncasserole recipe goes beyond comfort by adding plenty of nutrition, too. Onions, peppers and tomatoes join the chicken along with an unexpected ingredient to boost nutrition. What is the secret ingredient? Cottage cheese. Seriously!\nEven though you can't taste it because it takes on the other flavors in this dish, cottage cheese adds protein and calcium, along with the other\nhealth benefits of cottage cheese. There's also Parmesan cheese to add flavor and a golden topping. This is a great meal-planning recipe that freezes well, too.\nHere's your shopping list for this Italian-inspired pasta casserole recipe: short pasta (I used rotini), olive oil, onion, garlic, bell peppers, ground chicken, marinara sauce, cottage cheese, diced tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and oregano. Everything is mixed together, placed in a casserole dish then baked until golden.\nServe this cheesy casserole on its own, or with a\nsalad or your favorite vegetable side dish. So easy and delicious!\nNote: 30Seconds is a participant in the Amazon affiliate advertising program and this post contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a commission or fees if you make a purchase via those links.\nCuisine: American / Italian\nPrep Time: 10 minutes\nCook Time: 30 minutes\nTotal Time: 40 minutes\nServings: 10\nIngredients\n- 16 ounces\npasta\n- 2 tablespoons\nextra-virgin olive oil\n- 1 cup diced yellow onion\n- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 yellow bell pepper, diced\n- 1 green bell pepper, diced\n- 1 teaspoon\ndried oregano\n- 1 pound ground chicken (or turkey)\n- 1 jar (24 ounces)\nmarinara sauce(I used Rao's brand)\n- 1 can (15 ounces)\ndiced tomatoes\n- 2 cups cottage cheese\n- 4 ounces Parmesan cheese, shredded\n- fresh basil, for garnish (optional)\nHelpful Products\nSoup Pot Cutting Board Chef Knife Measuring Cups Measuring Spoons Salt and Pepper Saucepot Grater Nonstick Cooking Spray 13x9-inch Baking Pan Pasta Pot Pasta Bowls Pepper Grinder\nRecipe Notes\n- I used gluten-free rotini pasta, but you can use any smaller type of pasta (regular or gluten-free).\n- Feel free to add a sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes if you like more heat.\n- I used yellow and green bell peppers, but you can use any color of bell peppers in this recipe.\n- I used ground chicken, but you could use ground turkey or even ground beef, if desired.\n- Garnish with fresh basil, if desired.\n- Make ahead if you are meal planning, and refrigerate for up to four days.\n- Store leftovers in the refrigerator and reheat in the microwave.\nHere's how to make it:\n- In a large pasta pot, cook the pasta to al dente. When pasta is finished cooking, drain the water and set pasta aside.\n- While pasta is cooking, add the oil, onion, garlic and peppers to another large cooking pot. Over medium heat, stir to combine.\n- Add the ground chicken and oregano and stir to combine all ingredients. Sauté over medium heat until chicken is cooked through and onions are soft.\n- Add the marinara sauce and tomatoes and stir to combine.\n- Add the pasta and mix until incorporated.\n- Add the cottage cheese and stir until incorporated. Add salt and pepper to taste, if desired.\n- Pour the pasta and chicken mixture into a 13x9-inch casserole dish that's been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.\n- Top with the Parmesan cheese.\n- Place baking dish in a preheated 375-degree F oven and bake for about 25 minutes, or until it's hot and bubbly.
