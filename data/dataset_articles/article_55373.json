My plan is to cook my way through it this year (new year's resolution?). On page 63 there is a fantastic recipe for\nteriyaki beef bowls that is not just quick and easy, but full of Asian flavors. This ground beef recipe will be on repeat for dinner!\nTo make this\nAsian dinner you will need just a few simple ingredients. Here is your shopping list: vegetable oil, garlic, onion, carrot, zucchini, ground beef, soy sauce, mirin, cooking sake and granulated sugar. Ground beef and a few vegetables (the kids won't even know they're there) are cooked then coated in a simple four-ingredient homemade teriyaki sauce. Delicious!\nServe this tasty teriyaki ground beef over rice or Chinese noodles. This recipe is so quick and easy that you may have time to whip up some\ncrispy eggrolls or crab rangoon to serve alongside it.\nHere are a few more recipes from the cookbook:\nMagic Baked Rice(our most popular recipe of 2023) Crazy Crispy No-Oil Chicken Baked Fish Recipe With Lemon Cream Sauce\nNote: 30Seconds is a participant in the Amazon affiliate advertising program and this post contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a commission or fees if you make a purchase via those links.\nCuisine: Asian\nPrep Time: 8 minutes\nCook Time: 12 minutes\nTotal Time: 20 minutes\nServings: 4\nIngredients\n- 1 tablespoon\nvegetable oil\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced fine\n- 1 yellow onion, finely chopped\n- 1 carrot, peeled and grated\n- 1 zucchini, grated\n- 1 pound ground beef\nTeriyaki Sauce\n- 3 tablespoons\nsoy sauce\n- 3 tablespoons\nmirin\n- 3 tablespoons cooking sake (see Recipe Notes)\n- 1/2 teaspoon\ngranulated sugar\nHelpful Products\nRecipeTin Eats Dinner Sesame Seeds Cutting Board Chef Knife Measuring Spoons Skillet Grater Garlic Press Box Grater Chopsticks\nRecipe Notes\n- Cooking sake can be found on the beer and wine aisle at your grocery store or in Asian markets.\n- Try this recipe with ground turkey or ground chicken.\n- I used low-sodium soy sauce.\n- Magi garnishes the dish with sesame seeds.

Add the garlic and onion and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the carrot and zucchini and cook for another 3 minutes, or until any water in the vegetables evaporates.\n- Add the ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned.\n- Add the teriyaki sauce and cook for about 4 minutes or until sauce evaporates into the meat and the meat is a little caramelized.\n- Serve the beef over rice or noodles.\nNutrition Facts Per Serving\nCalories: 134\nTotal Fat: 5.1g\nSaturated Fat: 1.3g\nCholesterol: 22mg\nSodium: 265mg\nTotal Carbohydrate: 12.6g\nDietary Fiber: 1.5g\nTotal Sugars: 6.8g\nProtein: 9g\nVitamin D: 0mcg\nCalcium: 21mg\nIron: 5mg\nPotassium: 290mg\nRecipe cooking times, nutritional information and servings are approximate and provided for your convenience.
