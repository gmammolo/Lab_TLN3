  "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — New Year New You - it's a phrase we hear over and over this time of year!\nWe hear this phrase so much so...it almost starts to sound like a \"broken record\".\nWhat if how you arranged the space around you had a direct impact on the energy and activity around you? Here to explain more on \"How To Feng Shui Your Life” is author Marie Diamond.\n“Feng Shui can be described as the energy system of your home” says Diamond. She adds “how your home is aligned can directly impact the relationships, opportunities and the future.” According to the ancient Chinese art of Feng Shui, the attributes, spatial arrangement, and orientation of our physical surroundings directs the flow of our personal energy, or chi. Clearing the energy in your home or workspace to release the events of 2023 and start the new year with a clean, fresh slate should be your goal.\nMost people as they enter into the New Year may have a vision board to keep them on track. Feng Shui can affect your vision board. “The placement of the vision board as well as the content you put on it are extremely important....you never want to put it in the kitchen or bathroom” says Diamond. She continues “my advice to people just getting started is to first work on decluttering your space and life.” Everyone deals with clutter no matter if you have millions or far less; clutter is common to all. Some of the rules of Feng Shui emphasize how important it is to fix, declutter, replace, and get rid of the unused and old.
