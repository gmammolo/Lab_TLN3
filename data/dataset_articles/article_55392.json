  "text": "News Taylor Swift Has a New Favorite Cinnamon Roll — and We Have the Recipe You can bake the buttery cinnamon rolls that are Travis Kelce's must-have dessert at home. By Chandra Ram Chandra Ram Chandra Ram leads the digital food strategy for Food & Wine. She has 15 years experience writing and editing food content and developing recipes. A former restaurant cook and server, she also writes cookbooks. Food & Wine's Editorial Guidelines Updated on January 5, 2024 Trending Videos If you’re like us, you can’t help following Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s romance, especially when it involves their love of food. We know Swift is a talented baker who loves to whip up cookies, cakes, and whoopie pies at home. She even inspired a new name for the official state sandwich of New Jersey. Earlier this week, Swift was spotted dining with Brittany Mahomes and a few other wives and girlfriends of Chiefs players at Rye, a favorite spot of Kelce’s in Leawood, Kansas. As dinner wrapped, she had her new beau top of mind, ordering some of the restaurant’s famed cinnamon rolls to go. You may remember that only a few weeks ago, Swift was whipping up some pre-game cinnamon rolls for her favorite player. Whole Chickens, Gallons of Milk, and Other Things Donna Kelce Had to Feed Her NFL Star Sons Rye pastry chef and co-owner Megan Garrelts says Kelce regularly orders these rolls whenever he stops into the restaurant, so she wasn’t surprised when Swift got some to go. Garrelts spent years perfecting these cinnamon rolls, so it’s no wonder Kelce is such a fan. But if Swift ever gets a craving for these while on the road, Garrelts shared the recipe with Food & Wine back in 2019. Taylor, we’ve got you covered with Garrelts’ original Glazed Cinnamon Rolls with Pecan Swirls recipe. At the restaurant, Garrelts will bake and serve these cinnamon rolls straight from mini cast-iron skillets, but she modified her recipe for F&W so home cooks can bake up a batch without any special equipment. The sweet dough is wrapped around a filling of toasted pecans, cinnamon, brown sugar, and sour cream, then baked and topped with a buttery sugar glaze while still warm. The recipe Garrelts shared with us makes 24 cinnamon rolls; she notes that you can keep unbaked rolls in the freezer for up to a month, and then pull them out for your own pre-game brunch party. Which means you can bake some this weekend, and still have a batch in the freezer, ready for breakfast on Super Bowl Sunday. Each bite is tender, sweet, and full of nutty surprises — just like love and football, even if you’re not dating anyone playing in the game that day. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback!
