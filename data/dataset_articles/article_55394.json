With this project, we hope to strengthen our international ties and highlight the enriching experiences that travelers from around the world can have in India. Citizens of these nations can now access the Indian online visa system, which simplifies the application process for a variety of visa categories. Those looking to see the varied landscapes, rich cultural legacy, and historical riches of India will have an easier time getting their visas. INDIAN VISA FOR LUXEMBOURG CITIZENS Since 2014, the availability of the Indian Visa in electronic mode has been extended to Luxembourg nationals. The India e-Visa, a government-issued document, facilitates entry and travel to India for residents and citizens of Luxembourg. Online applications are accepted from Luxembourg, simplifying the overall process. Currently, more than 169 countries are eligible to apply for an Indian e-Visa. Introduced in 2017, the visa aims to streamline the process, saving time and money for tourists. Foreigners visiting India for pleasure, tourism, or short-term medical treatment have the option to apply for an eVisa. A Tourist visa, valid for a single entrance, allows a 30-day stay. For those desiring an extended stay in India for leisure purposes, Long-Term Tourist eVisas for 1 year and 5 years are available. These visas permit multiple entries during their validity period, with each stay limited to 90 days. An e-business visa, offering multiple entries, allows a 365-day stay, with a maximum continuous stay of 180 days per visit. Medical e-visas and Physician Assistant e-visas enable three entries into India for medical treatment or accompanying family members, allowing a total stay of 60 days from the first arrival date. The application process for the online Indian e-Visa is quick, taking only a few minutes to complete.

INDIAN VISA FOR CHILE CITIZENS In 2015, alterations to the visa procedure by the Indian government resulted in the extension of online travel authorization to 169 nations, including Chile. This modification allowed citizens of Chile to efficiently apply for electronic visas. Before entering India, individuals are required to present a valid passport and a visa as proof of identity. Since 2014, an online application form for Indian visas has been made accessible to Chileans. Chilean citizens now have a quicker and more convenient process for applying for a travel permit to India. There are three types of e-Visas available to Chileans: the e-Tourist Visa, the e-Business Visa, and the e-Medical Visa. The Tourist visa is suitable for those intending to visit India for tourism purposes, allowing a vacation, family reunion, sightseeing, or retreat for up to 90 days.

INDIAN VISA FOR ALBANIA CITIZENS Albanians, in addition to undertaking pilgrimages, plan vacations to India, benefiting from the friendly relations maintained between Albania and India. The Indian authorities mandate obtaining a visa before visiting the country. However, obtaining an Indian visa has become more accessible for Albanians since 2014. The Indian government introduced an online application form for Indian visas specifically designed for Albanian citizens, streamlining the process. The online document, akin to a paper visa, grants entry into the country. Notably, unlike a traditional paper visa, this online process eliminates the need to visit the embassy in person. In 2015, the Indian government revamped its visa process, extending online travel authorization to 169 countries, including Albania, thereby facilitating e-visa applications for Albanian citizens. Albanian citizens now have the option to apply for three distinct types of India e-Visas: the e-Tourist Visa, the e-Business Visa, or the e-Medical Visa. The Tourist e-Visa, valid for 30 days with a double entry, cannot be extended or converted. For longer stays, Albanian citizens may opt for a 1-year or 5-year Tourist e-visa, allowing multiple entries with a maximum stay of 1 year or 5 years, provided each stay does not exceed 90 days. The E-Business Visa, valid for 365 days from the date of Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) issuance, permits a stay of 365 days, with multiple entry options available. The Electronic Medical Visa is issued to Albanian citizens requiring medical treatment in India, allowing three entries and a maximum stay of 60 days from the date of arrival.

Prospective visitors can apply for a visa online and secure approval before departing from Mexico, offering a convenient approach. While Mexico isn't part of India's visa waiver nations, the application for an India e-Visa is accessible for Mexican citizens. Since 2014, the Indian government has made the Indian Visa application form available online specifically for Mexican citizens. Various types of India e-Visas cater to different activities such as tourism, business travel, family visits, and short-term medical treatment. For instance, the India Single Entry tourist Visa allows a stay of up to 90 days and covers activities like tourism, family visits, or stays at wellness retreats.
