  "text": "Wisconsin junior outside linebacker Kaden Johnson entered the transfer portal earlier today.\nHe joins a growing list of notable Badger defensemen to enter the portal, including defensive end Darian Varner, defensive end Rodas Johnson and linebacker Jordan Turner. Add starting linebacker Maema Njongmeta declaring for the NFL Draft, and it looks as if Wisconsin will need new starters at numerous key positions entering 2024.\nJohnson previously joined the Wisconsin program as a four-star recruit and No. 1 player from Minnesota in the class of 2020. His career in Madison was largely uneventful, recording only 29 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss and one sack in his three years of playing time.\nI would like to thank everyone who has been on this journey with me and couldn’t be more thankful for the relationships I built in Madison❤️ with that being said I’m officially in the transfer portal, looking for a new home! pic.twitter.com/7yB7npP4cZ\n— Kaden Johnson (@KadenJohnson9) January 5, 2024\nWisconsin’s incoming transfer class is ranked No. 14 nationally at the moment and includes numerous linebackers. So depth at the positions shouldn’t be an issue, the question is will some top-end talent emerge.",
