The online restaurant reservation and review company released its ‘Top 100 Restaurants with Healthy Bites’ on Friday, Jan. 5 and it featured four Okanagan establishments: - Old Vines Restaurant at Quails’ Gate Winery - West Kelowna; - BLOCK ONE Restaurant at 50th Parallel Winery - Lake Country; - Shaughnessy’s Cove - Summerland; - PeakFine at Sparkling Hill Resort - Vernon. Opentable got these results based off of more than over 1.1 million reviews on its website and dining metrics from Oct. 1, 2022 to Sept. 30, 2023 as well as an online survey on conducted by PureSpectrum from Nov. 13 - 27, 2023.
