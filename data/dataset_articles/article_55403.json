  "text": "SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, CA. (News 4 & Fox 11) — A Minden couple welcomed the first baby of the New Year at Barton Health. Barton Health representatives say Athena Magdalene Roundy was born to Mackenzie Wagstaff and Kyle Roundy at 4:30 p.m. She weighed 6 pounds, 12 ounces and measured 19 inches long, Dr. Clare Rudolph, board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist (OB/GYN) and Medical Director of Barton OB/GYN, oversaw the delivery at Barton Memorial Hospital’s Family Birthing Center. “Everyone has been so wonderful and genuine. The [obstetricians] and midwives are amazing,” said Wagstaff. “We definitely want to have all our other kids at Barton!” Kyle is an electrical engineer and Mackenzie is now a full time mom. When asked if there was a specific Labor and Delivery team member they’d like to recognize, Wagstaff exclaimed, “Oh I couldn't pick just one; everyone has been great!” The family was presented with a wagon filled with gift items donated by local businesses and organizations valued at over $2,500.",
