  "text": "‘There’s no place like this’: Conway mayor talks plans, improvements for the city in 2024 CONWAY, S.C. (WMBF) - Conway’s mayor said she’s proud of the city’s accomplishments in 2023, but as she looks to 2024, she admits improvements can be made. Overall, Mayor Barbara Blain-Bellamy believes Conway is in a great place, and only getting better. “There’s no place like this, and I would put us against any other community, any other municipality anywhere,” said Blain-Bellamy. As Blain-Bellamy begins her third term, she’s taking time to reflect. She said projects like the Chestnut Bay Resilience Project are top of mind. “We have repeated flooding, and we have devastating flooding, so it’s our attempt to use our FEMA-given properties and put them in their natural state so that nature can handle excess water the way it was intended to be done,” she said. The mayor also brought up the old Whittemore Elementary School. She said she’s excited to see what the new task force, created this year, will do moving forward. “Years ago, when we spoke to the public about what they wanted, generally we were talking about things that help people get from where they are to the next step,” Blain-Bellamy said. “There were needs spoken of like daycare after school programs, but also GED classes, learning interview skills, writing resumes.” But, she admitted the city could have acted faster. “I do wish that when we accepted that building, that we were better prepared to act on it sooner,” she said. “I think time was an enemy and time was more of an enemy because of our inability to act. We accepted it without funding in place to move forward with improvements.” Blain-Bellamy said she’s also excited about growth projects, but said the city has to be prepared infrastructure-wise. “When you consider bringing in thousands of more residential units, we’re talking about multi-thousands of people and automobiles and the need for movement, clearly something will have to be done, there’s no question about it,” Blain-Bellamy explained. There are still questions, though, about a recent cross-burning incident police say was racially motivated just outside Conway city limits.

But, overall, Blain-Bellamy said she believes Conway has made forward inclusion strides, offering more cultural celebrations and openly supporting the LGBTQ+ community. “Those are the kinds of things that make me the most proud because buildings and parks and ambiance is one thing, but feeling a part of your community is one that’s I think even greater,” said Blain-Bellamy. The mayor is not only focusing on 2024 but several years ahead. Some ideas she would like to see become reality are turning the old Grainger Plant property into a recreation center and building a bridge over the Waccamaw River. Copyright 2024 WMBF.
