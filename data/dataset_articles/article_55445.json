  "text": "Long-standing members of the Tahlequah Area Chamber of Commerce say they’ve been inspired to become more active since the new CEO and president took the helm. Each month, the Tahlequah Area Chamber of Commerce hosts the Monthly Mingle at a different business in town, and this month’s event was held at Peak Health and Performance on Jan. 5. The purpose of the Mingles is to allow networking among area businesses and for residents to attend and meet local merchants. A buffet of juice, coffee and breakfast sandwich was served. Ward 2 City Councilor Keith Baker and William Morgan of Elephant Rock Garden Supply, emceed the event. Elephant Rock is the presenting sponsor for all of the Mingles in this fiscal year. Superintendent of Tahlequah Public Schools Tanya Jones said attends these functions because TPS has been a member of the Chamber for several decades. Lacie Wilson, principal of Tahlequah High School, also attended to show support for the Chamber. “I think TPS has been a member of the Chamber for a long time, but they were never active. We are a $46 million business in this city, that’s our budget,” Jones said. “People don’t think of school in those terms. And these people are what make our schools work so we have to make our school work for the community because if we don’t have good schools, businesses aren’t going to want to come here.” The superintendent said TPS’ relationship with the Chamber is excellent. “And since Nathan Reed has taken over as executive director, he has sought the schools out from the beginning of his work with the Chamber and has forged a connection that we’ve just run with, and it’s terrific,” Jones said. Reed, CEO and president of the Chamber, concurred with Jones’ comments and said that has been the position of the chambers of commerce with which he has been associated in the past. “In Siloam Springs, we had a very close partnership with the school district, and I was honestly shocked that they didn’t have one when I came here,” Reed said. “It was when Leon Ashlock was superintendent. One of my first meetings when I came here was with him, to find out how we can support the school district.” Reed said that since TPS has minimal bonding capacity, it is beneficial for TPS to have relationships with businesses for donations and partnerships. “But it’s also beneficial for the Chamber as well, because we want people to live here, stay here, and if we don’t have a strong educational system – that’s the No. 1 [concern] with a family. So if we can help facilitate those relationships with TPS and the business community, that’s beneficial to the Chamber when we are recruiting businesses to come to Tahlequah. A strong education is the backbone of a community,” Reed said. Chance and Jade Adams own Peak Health and Performance and have been members of the Chamber since opening in December 2023. “I think it’s important as a local business to join the Chamber because of the value you get out of it – the local Mingles, the relationships,” Chance said. Jade pointed out an attendee and bragged on the woman’s progress she has made since becoming a client for the personal training services. “She’s lost 22 pounds and 22 inches,” Jade said. Marsha Crosslin with the Cherokee County Assessor’s Office attends the Monthly Mingles to connect personally with local business owners. “We are seen as the bad guys because we raise property taxes. So we try and come out and smooth the way,” Crosslin said. Jeremy Jones, branch manager for the Tahlequah Public Library, attends the Chamber’s events to exchange ideas with other members on how the library can continue to expand efforts to help the community. “[I’m] just mingling, making connections, trying to see how we can help serve everybody,” he said. What’s next The next Tahlequah Area Chamber of Commerce Monthly Mingle is Feb. 2, 8 a.m., at BancFirst.",
