  "text": "Rossen Reports: Financial resolutions to start 2024 off right We’re all making New Year’s resolutions, but one of them should be focused on your money. Financial experts say the following are some resolutions that you can make to set you on the right path for 2024. Resolution: Pay off credit card debt. If you’re struggling with this, you’re not alone. Studies show that the average person has about $6,000 in credit card debt. Consider consolidating your credit card debts onto a balance transfer credit card. Moving high-interest debt to a card that has no interest for a certain amount of time can be a money-saver. Balance transfer credit cards typically come with an interest-free introductory period of anywhere from 6 to 21 months. Then, once that period ends, make sure you’re at least paying off the minimum payment balance every month on time. Just remember, not paying off the full balance during the transfer period could result in additional fees and charges. Nerdwallet did an [article](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/credit-cards/balance-transfer) on cards to consider that might work for you. Resolution: Work on your credit score. FICO scores break down as the following; - 800 to 850: Exceptional - 740 to 799: Very good - 670 to 739: Good - 580 to 669: Fair - 300 to 579: Poor This year, check your score more often. Doing this WON’T lower your score! You can check it for free using Credit Karma, Chase Credit Journey and CreditWise from Capital One. (You don’t need an account with those credit cards, either.) Resolution: Monitor your credit. Sign up for credit report monitoring and identity theft protection in 2024. You can do that through Credit Karma, Chase Credit Journey and CreditWise from Capital One or through Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. We want to make sure we’re spotting identify fraud right away so that if it does happen to you, you’ll catch it before it’s too late. Resolution: Get ready for retirement. If you can afford it, financial experts say you can max out your retirement account. The contribution limits have gone up for this year, so take advantage. It’s now $23,000, up from $22,500. If you're 50 or older, you're eligible for an additional $7,500 in catch-up contributions as well. If you know you can’t max out your contribution, at least contribute what you can. Investing just a few hundred dollars in the year is SOMETHING. If your employer matches contributions, make sure you’re contributing up to that limit so you KNOW you’re not leaving “free money” on the table.",
