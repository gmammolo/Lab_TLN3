  "text": "The Central PA Region Sports Car Club of America's (SCCA) Witches Rallye, an annual charity road rally, raised $1,000 for the State College-based Jana Marie Foundation, according to a news release. Held in November, it marked the 54th year that teams have embarked on a driving scavenger hunt, guided by a packet of cryptic clues, to find various checkpoints along the roads of Central Pennsylvania. The fundraiser, sponsored by Bobby Rahal Honda, welcomed 24 teams. Since 2012, Jana Marie Foundation has worked to knock down walls and stigma surrounding mental health and suicide awareness. Through the power of dialogue and creative expression, it sparks conversations, builds connections and promotes mental well-being with young people and their communities. “We had a great turnout,” Chris Paveglio, the SCCA chapter ’s Solo Chair, said in a news release. “The teams were so creative in their costumes! I love seeing what themes everyone comes up with. Teams were generous with donations to Jana Marie [Foundation] and the food bank; we thank them so much. We have such a wide range of participants — families with kids, young couples, older couples, and just groups of friends having fun for the night — and some teams came from as far away as West Virginia and Maryland to participate We thank everyone who participated or helped out — and hope to spread the word for [the 2024] rallye!” For more information on Jana Marie Foundation, suicide prevention, mental health, and foundation events, visit janamariefoundation.org and follow Jana Maria Foundation on Facebook and Instagram .
