  "text": "She’ll have the eggplant. Women who switch to vegan diets see their libido levels increase by up to 383%, researchers from Stanford University have determined. The frisky, cruelty-free findings are revealed in the new Netflix docuseries, “You Are What You Eat,” which tracks 22 sets of identical twins who adopt plant-based eating habits for eight weeks. The participants underwent a variety of scientific experiments to explore how certain foods can impact the body, with two sets of female twins having their libido levels measured while watching porn . “Not only did this study provide a groundbreaking way to assert that a vegan diet is healthier than the conventional omnivore diet, but the twins were also a riot to work with,” Christopher Gardern, PhD, declared in a press release about the experiments. To examine any impact to libido levels, two sets of twins, Pam and Wendy and Carolyn and Rosalyn, were asked to watch a variety of different videos while lab equipment was used to measure the temperature of their genitals. The temperature levels are a known marker of sexual arousal. The women were first required to watch a documentary on birds to assess their baseline measurements. They were subsequently asked to watch some porn of their own choosing. The experiment was conducted before the four women switched to a vegan diet. The experiment was subsequently repeated eight weeks later to see whether the plant-based diets had made any impact on their sex drives. Shockingly, all four of the women’s libido levels surged. Pam saw a staggering 371% increase in arousal, while twin sister Carolyn was also 288% hornier eight weeks into her vegan diet plan. Meanwhile, Carolyn’s arousal levels surged 383%, while her identical twin Rosalyn experienced a 212% hike. Stanford scientists did not declare how, exactly, a vegan diet could cause a drastic increase in arousal, but theorized that nutrients in vegetables helped improve blood flow to the genitals. It remains to be seen whether a vegan diet has the same sexed-up impact on men. If it does, it may prompt many males to re-assess stereotypes about veganism. A recent study found fewer men are adopting vegan diets because they don’t think the lifestyle is “manly” enough.",
