  "text": "Coco Gauff: US Open champion cruises into ASB Classic semi-finals after easy win over Varvara Gracheva\nByEurosport\nUpdated 05/01/2024 at 10:49 GMT\nCoco Gauff has progressed to the semi-finals of the ASB Classic after beating France's Varvara Gracheva in straight sets. The 19-year-old American produced a complete performance against her error-prone opponent, slamming down five aces and hitting 13 winners as she went on to book her place in the last four. \"I thought I served really well,\" Gauff said after her third win of the year.\nCoco Gauff cruised into the semi-finals of the ASB Classic with a 6-1 6-1 win over Varvara Gracheva in Auckland on Friday.\nThe reigning US Open champion has now won her last eight matches in Auckland and not dropped a set in that time. She will play No. 4 seed Emma Navarro in the semi-finals on Saturday.\nGauff, who is defending her title in New Zealand, needed just 53 minutes to dispatch her opponent, Gracheva, after a rain-delayed start to the match.\nGauff raced to a 3-0 lead before Gracheva held her serve for the first time, but the American took the opening set in 33 minutes as her first serve, combined with her power and precision from the baseline, proved too much for the Frenchwoman.\nThe second set followed a similar pattern as Gauff built up a 4-0 lead. Gracheva's unforced error count continued to rise while Gauff was clinical on break points, converting five of seven.\nThe world No. 3 sealed her place in the semi-finals by converting her third match point.\n\"I thought I served really well,\" Gauff, who won 21 of 29 points on her first serve, said afterwards.\n\"Probably the best so far in the tournament, which is something I've been working on off-season. I'm really happy with how I played.\n\"I'm glad I was able to finish my match [before more rain].\"\nChina's Xiyu Wang is through to the semi-finals after a 7-6(3) 3-6 6-4 win over Diane Perry.\nWang won the last five games in a row to come back and beat Perry and extend her head-to-head record to 2-0 over the Frenchwoman.\nThe world No. 71 will play Elina Svitolina next after the Ukrainian beat Marie Bouzkova 6-0 6-3 in just one hour and six minutes.\n- - -\nStream the 2024 Australian Open live and on demand on\ndiscovery+\nRelated Topics\nShare this article\nRelated Matches\nAdvertisement\nAd\nAdvertisement\nAd",
