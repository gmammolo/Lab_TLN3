  "text": "Small dog breeds never let their size stop them from accomplishing what they want to do. Between the yapping used for intimidation to fast-moving paws to keep up, they are a determined bunch and one dachshund online doesn't let the stairs stop her from soaring to new heights. A [dachshund](https://www.newsweek.com/dachshund-crying-bathroom-instagram-1857814) from Spain named Trufa loves to jump off the three stairs in her house. Her owner throws a toy down the hallway, the pup runs as quickly as possible and then jumps off the top step to catch it. A viral [TikTok](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/tiktok) video of Trufa jumping off the stairs was posted to the social media platform on Thursday by @thisistrufa and quickly brought in over 2 million views, leaving viewers impressed and concerned. The video's caption translated to English reads: \"Flying Trufa.\" Newsweek reached out to @thisistrufa via TikTok for additional comment. TikTok Users React Plenty of TikTok users were obsessed with how high and far this dog was able to jump, especially given her tiny size. \"Pretty sure those ears generate lift,\" pointed out a viewer. One TikTok user commented: \"Why do they all do this? My weenier dog FLIES off every step.\" Those who had or do have dachshunds brought up concern for the dog's safety. \"I know they love to do this, but my boy has had two back surgeries and we're really lucky he still has mobility. Make ramps, and teach them,\" one user wrote. Meanwhile, in the comment section of the video, the owner wrote that there are ramps in the house, but that Trufa still loves to jump. Safety First Dachshund owners need to be cautious with their dogs jumping similar to what is seen in this video as the breed is prone to back problems. A veterinarian at NorthStar VETS in New Jersey wrote in a Q&A blog post in 2013 that a dachshund's back problem is more commonly referred to as a spinal problem. Dachshunds are frequently associated with intervertebral disc disease and are more susceptible to it than any other dog breed. Dachshund owners can help prevent problems associated with the disease by controlling their dog's activity. These dogs should avoid high-impact activities, such as jumping, high-speed running, rough-housing, and absolutely no [tug-of-war](https://www.newsweek.com/getting-fit-dog-2024-health-1853681). Even going up and down the stairs and slow speeds is not recommended as standard stairs are not well-suited According to the Q&A, the following devices can help dachshunds avoid some of the activities that lead to spinal issues: a leash, a harness collar, a [dog crate](https://www.newsweek.com/naughty-dog-getting-moved-max-security-prison-goes-viralv-1856643), ramps, or using your own hands to pick them up.
