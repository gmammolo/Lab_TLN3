  "text": "Roadhouse Cinemas is adding a family entertainment venue to its Tucson location.\nThe local theater has leased the former Bed Bath & Beyond building at Crossroads Festival Shopping Center, on Grant and Swan roads.\nThe theater currently shares a wall with the vacant 36,518-square-foot building, so the two venues will be connected, said Josh Snider, co-owner of Roadhouse Cinemas .\n“We’re going to add four or five living room-size auditoriums in the new space with about 10 seats,” he said. “You’ll be able to go there with your family and have a room all to yourself and watch a movie.”\nThe new space will also have 14 lanes of bowling, Topgolf Swing Suites , ax-throwing and a large arcade with more than 120 games.\n Roadhouse Cinemas opened a location in Colorado Springs in 2020 with an entertainment component and it has been very successful, Snider said.\n“It’s a way to diversify a little bit because since COVID, the movie industry has not been booming,” he said. “People just love it, and we have a lot fun operating it.”\nSnider expects to hire between 40 and 50 people for the entertainment component, which has not yet been branded.\nBarring any major hiccups, he hopes it will open in the fall.\nThe Crossroads Festival Shopping Center landlord Larsen Baker was represented by its broker Isaac Figueroa in the lease.\nThe cinema has a third location in Scottsdale that opened in 2017 and is still interested in a second Tucson theater.\n“We’re looking at the west side, but are open to any opportunities,” Snider said.\nHe and his business partners, Scott Cassell and Vincent Mast, opened Tucson’s first dine-in movie theater in 2014 at 4811 E. Grant Road, in the space formerly occupied by Grand Cinemas Crossroads 6.\nIn 2017, the theater was expanded from 23,000 to 33,000 square feet and added three auditoriums, expanded kitchen and bakery.\nFrom AAA action flicks, to family friendly animation, the first six months of 2024 are filled with flicks heading to theaters.
