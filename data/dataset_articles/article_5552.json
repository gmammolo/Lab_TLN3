  "text": "Support us Your support is essential for us to continue providing you with the best in alternative international news. It is thanks to your donations that we can stay the course for diverse and truly alternative information. We are counting on you.\nParticipate\nChina sends an ultimatum to the United States demanding the release of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Congresswoman Cilia Flores.\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement described as a \"Final Warning\" addressed directly to the US government.\nThis demand marks a high point in diplomatic relations between the two countries. China states in the communiqué that any action against the freedom of the Venezuelan leader will be considered not only an aggression against the South American nation, but also a direct attack on the stability of the multipolar order and China's strategic interests in the region.\n« Do not underestimate our determination \"says the spokesperson for the Chinese chancery, who used rather strong language.\n« China's patience has its limits; the United States is playing with fire by trying to undermine the will of a sovereign people and remove its legitimate leader. We urge Washington to correct its mistake immediately before the situation reaches a point of no return. \", the statement said.\nThis diplomatic initiative must be considered in light of the choices made by China and Brazil to defend the UN. We are witnessing a desire to rely on international law, which, it must be said, has thus far served the US and the Western world well. But here too, we must recognize that the law of the jungle, the Wild West scenario enacted by Trump, is unlikely to reverse the trend, but rather to create damage through widespread disorder and boundless vandalism. Furthermore, not all institutions are solely the product of the will of capital, even at its imperialist stage; they are the product of class struggle, extended to a global scale, including through wars, and the UN Charter is a prime example. We must also begin to grasp the scale of this mobilization by observing its coincidence with Lula's call for Latin American unity and with the initiative—which we will return to later—of KPRF Vice President Novikov, the closest figure to the Chinese and Cubans in favor of Maduro's release (an initiative relayed by the Russian Embassy). The fact that such a call to defend Cuba is being launched even as an equally illegal offensive—the attack by Iran, an initiative that worries even other regional powers—is being set in motion is significant. This is the very essence of a multipolar world in defense of humanity, a world that is unfolding behind the scenes as the financial collapse of the empire is being orchestrated.\nhistory and society\n*\nRussian parliamentarians create a commission for the release of President Nicolás Maduro\nby TeleSur\nDmitri Novikov stressed that the committee he represents is made up of people who firmly believe in the prevalence of principles and conscience in the world, and for which they are prepared to fight.\n“International solidarity and the active defense of law and justice are fundamental pillars,” stressed Dmitri Novikov. Photo: State Duma\nDmitry Novikov, first vice-chairman of the State Duma's international affairs committee and vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), announced on Wednesday, January 28, the creation of a public committee dedicated to the release of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores.\nThis committee is composed of 27 members, he explained. We are fighting for the release of Nicolás Maduro, convinced that we are in the right and strengthened by our experience in this matter. \" added Novikov.\nNovikov emphasized the need for a fight guided by honor, conscience, and principles. It's not about saying: if there's a 99% chance of success, I'll participate, and if there's only a 9% chance, I'll stay out of it. \" he said, stressing that solidarity must be unconditional in these battles.\nThe official emphasized that the committee he represents is composed of individuals who firmly believe in the primacy of principles and conscience in the world and are prepared to defend them. Furthermore, Dmitri pointed out that there are precedents and success stories that demonstrate the viability of such causes, such as the release of South African leader and future president, Nelson Mandela.\nThe Russian parliamentarian reaffirmed the unwavering commitment of his commission, assuring that it would pursue its work systematically and with sustained perseverance over time.\n« This work is based on the profound conviction that international solidarity and the active defense of law and justice are fundamental pillars. \" he emphasized.\nFinally, the parliamentarian expressed his certainty that, even in the most complex and unfavorable circumstances, the application of these values ​​can lead to concrete and tangible results.\nVenezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was kidnapped along with his wife, First Lady Cilia Flores, on January 3, after US forces bombed Caracas and other parts of the country, killing around 100 people and injuring a similar number.\nCurrently, the Venezuelan president is being illegally imprisoned in a high-security prison, at the hands of the American judicial system, on false charges of drug and arms trafficking.\nsource: TeleSur via history and society",
