  "text": "Kim Kardashian is putting in hours at the gym!\nRelated: Taylor Swift’s Strict Diet & Workout For The Eras Tour!\nOn Instagram Thursday, the reality TV star took to her Stories to share a new video of herself working out with her sister Khloé Kardashian — and WOW, she’s going super intense with these new routines! In the caption of the video, she wrote:\n“Workouts w @khloehardashian really do it for me “\nIt seems like her little sis makes a great coach, considering throughout the video she gasped and said:\n“Oh my god!”\nThe Good American co-founder pushes Kimmy Kakes a step further and asked:\n“What are you training for?”\nThe SKIMS founder, in between lifting weights, quickly told her that she was training for “life” — but KoKo had other ideas! She argued:\n“The Olympics! … Holy f**k you’re gonna f**k me up later!”\nCh-ch-check out her incredible muscles (below):\n(c) Kim Kardashian/Instagram (c) Kim Kardashian/Instagram AH-Mazing!!\nWhile Kim never confirmed nor denied she was reaching for the stars with Olympics -level goals (hey, she tried to be a lawyer so ya never know!), it’s apparent she’s pushing herself to the limit in the new year! On Friday, the 43-year-old added several more videos to her Stories, filmed by her trainer Senada Greca . Throughout the clips, The Kardashians star shows off her “leg day” routine, including hamstring curls, step-ups, and hip thrusts.\nIn one caption, the socialite encouraged her followers to follow their new years resolutions just like she is:\n“We’re going for heavier weights this year. Set small fitness goals and stick with them.”\nKim isn’t holding back when it comes to staying fit and fresh in 2024!
