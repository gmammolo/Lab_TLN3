  "text": "Every year, approximately 6.5 million companion animals enter shelters nationwide, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Of those, about 3.3 million are dogs and 3.2 million are cats. Each week, The Arizona Republic highlights a handful of the many pets up for adoption at Valley shelters. To check the status of a specific animal, please contact the shelter directly.\nFrito: Looking for attention Frito is a 7-year-old, 51-pound Terrier blend who joined Friends for Life Animal Rescue recently from the Humane Society of Yuma.\nThis friendly, easy-going guy, loves attention, especially being petted. He gets excited when he knows he'll be going for a walk, but quickly settles and has excellent leash manners, with an always wagging tail.\nFrito will be best as your only canine companion as he can be a bit forward when he meets other dogs and other dogs don't seem to like that!\nHe is a well-behaved gentleman who is treat motivated!\nHow to adopt: This handsome boy is living with one of the amazing foster homes of Friends for Life and will be at their adoption center, located at 952 W. Melody Ave in Gilbert, on Saturdays from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. until adopted. You can also email Debbie@azfriends.org if you'd like to set up an appointment to meet Frito during the week. Frito is neutered, licensed, microchipped, and current on vaccinations. His adoption fee is $95. For information on Friends for Life Animal Rescue, or other dogs or cats looking for homes, visit azfriends.org, or call 480-497-8296.\n— Jannelle Cosgriff, Friends for Life",
