  "text": "Opened: October 2023\nThis cheery mom-and-pop is a new player in the Gilbert brunch game, offering burritos, Benedicts, hangover bowls of nachos and loaded fries, scrambled egg-filled tacos, avocado toasts, wraps, salads, sandwiches and burgers. The bummer is, almost everything in the breakfast section looks and tastes the same – a pretty jumble of ingredients that are ultimately unexciting. Breakfast bacon fries, built on wimpy waffle fries (why not real fries?), are saggy, ineffective scoops for scrambled egg, bacon, cheese fondue, avocado, salsa, pickled onions and cilantro ($15). And guess what? If you swap waffle fries for corn tortillas, the mix-and-match tacos (one sausage, one bacon, one green chile, $16) are essentially the same thing. I can find far better tacos for less money.\nSteak and eggs Benedict (i.e., carne asada and cheese fondue, $15) are too much like the loaded fries, which are too much like the tacos. Blah cheese fondue is no substitute for hollandaise, either. Best savory dish by a mile? A charred, juicy burger topped with feta and red onion jam ($16). This I like.\nWild Card: Florid French toast in various iterations – cookie butter tiramisu, bananas Foster and ridiculously good prickly pear cheesecake on a pretzel crust (crunchy, creamy, sweet and tart all at once, $12). Deliciously fun and worth the drive.\n734 N. McQueen Rd., Gilbert,\n801-564-2174, thanksabrunchaz.com",
