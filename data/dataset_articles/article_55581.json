AskMen may get paid if you click a link in this article and buy a product or service.\nWhen it comes to skincare, most men don't think much beyond summer sunscreens and aloe vera, but the truth is that the winter can wreak havoc on your skin. The extreme cold, dry air, and even sun exposure can all cause serious damage to the skin of your face and body, but bundling up under multiple layers of clothing can also cause problems, denying our skin fresh air or causing chaffing.\nThat's where the right body lotion can work wonders.\nThink of body lotion like another layer of defense against the winter chill, with the ability to calm dry, chapped skin on your neck, hands or arms. Body lotions can also nourish and fortify your skin throughout the rest of the year, but it’s crucial and important to use it during times of the year when your skin is especially prone to excess dryness.\nRELATED: 5 Common Skin Care Mistakes Men Make\nBody lotion is also useful if you’ve got tattoos and want to give them some extra fortification (once they’re properly healed, that is). Above all else, body lotion is not to be overlooked. Add some to your grooming rotation right now with our 10 favorite picks, featured below in all their glory.\nBest Lotions to Heal Dry Winter Skin Aesop Breathless We begin with a decidedly high-end option, but if you're in the market for a nourishing body lotion, you can't do much better than Breathless by Aesop. This botanically-based formula, enriched with nut oils and Vitamin E, heals and moisturizes dry skin like no other.\n$37 at Aesop.com\nMad Rabbit Replenish Body Lotion If, on the other hand, you’d prefer lotion without fragrance, Mad Rabbit – a major player in the world of tattoo care – has a universal moisturizer sans a scented finish. This moisturizer works if you’re tatted up, but is also particularly useful even if you don’t have any ink. The key is a blend of butters and plant-derived ceramides to deliver non-greasy, fast-absorbing skin hydration.\n$37 at MadRabbit.com\nDove for Men Ultra-Hydra Cream Dove for Men goes above and beyond with a thick, super-nourishing cream that offers up hours upon hours of hydration. It’s essential for especially dry skin types and areas prone to chapped skin during the winter, like your neck. It also works on your face and hands, so it’s really a 3-in-1 moisturizer that’s plenty useful, no matter the time of year.\n$3.95 for 3 at Amazon.com\nHero Brave Body Deep Scrub\nIf you're focused more on repairing damaged skin rather than preventing future damage, pick up the Brave Body Deep Scrub from Hero Cosmetics. It may look small, but this tiny package packs a mighty punch: just one application per week will help visibly renew your damaged skin and better help your body face down the ravages of winter weather.\n$10.49 at HeroCosmetics.us\nVaseline Men's Healing Hand and Body Lotion Target dry skin and hands with this dual-purpose, extra-strength lotion especially suited to dry skin. It absorbs in 15 seconds to lock in nourishment, and it doesn’t hurt that you’ve probably used Vaseline as a treatment for dry skin for years, too. Think of this as a new and improved body lotion for the modern man.\n$17.69 for 3 at Amazon.com\nGold Bond Men’s Everyday Hydrating Lotion Like Vaseline, you’ve trusted Gold Bond powders for years, right? Extend that trust to a Shaq-approved hydrating lotion (seriously, it says so right on the body lotion) in a large size ideal for plenty of daily use. Seven moisturizers and three vitamins bolster the rich, nourishing quality of this thick cream, so get your bottle today.\n$11.99 at Amazon.com\nOld Spice Daily Hydration Lotion Shea butter powers this deeply hydrating body lotion, which gets a further boost from the bold amber scent (befitting an Old Spice product, no doubt). You can use it as a hand lotion, too, and you get the added benefit of being able to scoop it up in a highly useful four-pack from Amazon.\n$27.25 for 4 at Amazon.com\nJack Black Cool Moisture Body Lotion Jack Black’s aptly named Body Lotion is designed to penetrate the skin and lock in next-level hydration, and the brand says it’s especially useful on your knees, elbows and feet. Seeing as those areas tend to get overlooked as part of a grooming routine, this body lotion could prove to be an essential addition to your daily rotation.\n$32 at Amazon.com\nMalin + Goetz Vitamin B5 Body Lotion Malin + Goetz has long been the standard in premium grooming for well-groomed guys, with an intensive approach that yields wonderful fragrances and products that perform even better than they look. This vitamin-packed lotion is no different, using bergamot and plenty of vitamins to lock in moisture quickly without that greasy feeling.\n$74 at MalinandGoetz.com\nOars + Alps Body Lotion Oars & Alps stays winning when it comes to natural skincare, with an entire line of products approved and used by NFL star DeAndre Hopkins. The key to this body lotion is shea butter, but arnica and magnesium are also in the mix to reduce and relieve muscle soreness. It’s a one-of-a-kind body lotion fit for star athletes and your grooming routine.\n$12 at OarsandAlps.com\nYou Might Also Dig:\nBest Callus Removers Best Face Sunscreens for Men Best Skincare Products on Amazon",
