  "text": "Barrio Bagels\nbarriobread.com\nAfter Don Guerra of Tucson’s Barrio Bread won the James Beard Award for Outstanding Baker in 2022, he started exploring Valley partnerships to cultivate his idea for a heritage grain bagel. Ultimately, he found a perfect union with Hayden Flour Mills in Gilbert to bake and sell bread there every Tuesday, including Sonoran wheat sourdough bagels without sugars or oils, offered in plain, sesame and everything varieties ($10.50-$12.50 for six bagels). While most people focus on the style of bagel – be it New York or Montreal – Guerra hangs his hat on the ingredients. “For me, making bread is all about the regional grain. It’s about supporting local agriculture, local economics and local gastronomy.” The bagels are made with 85-percent whole grain and have a crisp crust and chewy interior. Pre-order online for Tuesday pickup at Hayden Flour Mill. The bagels will also be available soon at Valley deli chain Chompie’s, Guerra says.\nLos Amaya’s Salsa Co.\nlosamayassalsa.com\nBisbee native Marcos Amaya learned how to make salsa from his father, who crafted the spicy condiment with small, fiery chiltepin peppers native to Sonora. Amaya’s homemade chiltepin salsa became a big hit at parties and family gatherings, so three years ago the health-care executive decided to make it a side hustle. Using fresh vegetables, fruits, spices and seasonings, he puts out six premium salsas ($10) including mango and prickly pear varieties, plus his newest additions: salsa verde with tomatillos and green chiles, and Santa Muerte, a blistering blend of chiltepin, chipotle, ghost and reaper peppers. Amaya, a former U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter door gunner, aims to elevate jarred salsa to a new level. “Let’s be honest: Most of the salsas in the grocery store just aren’t that good,” he says. Amaya also makes and sells tortilla chips ($5) perfect for scooping up his salsas. Find Los Amaya’s Salsa at Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market, Fry’s Food Stores and retailers across the Valley.\nTom’s Incredible Ice Cream\ntomsincredibleice-cream.com\nWalk into Tom’s Incredible Ice Cream in Old Town Scottsdale and you’ll be greeted by the sweet scent of waffle cones and freshly baked cakes. Owned by business partners Tom Medrano and Jake Weintraub, Tom’s is a certified kosher ice cream shop that – in addition to regular cones and cups – sells elaborate ice cream cakes ($30-$60). Baked on site, the cakes are layered with a choice of ice cream – sourced from Hershey’s Ice Cream, a premium brand from Pennsylvania, surprisingly not associated with the famed Hershey’s Chocolate – and decorated to the customer’s specifications. One of the most popular cakes has ice cream cones embedded in the frosting and is studded with colorful sprinkles, while other cakes sport frosting rosettes, dripping caramel, nuts and candy. For folks who have dietary concerns, rest assured: Tom’s makes gluten-free and vegan cakes and regularly stocks a couple dairy-free ice cream flavors. “We have diverse options, and it’s all high quality,” Weintraub says.\nJames Beard-Caliber Bagels\nChiltepin Salsas\nIce Cream Cakes\nBarrio Bagels\nbarriobread.com\nAfter Don Guerra of Tucson’s Barrio Bread won the James Beard Award for Outstanding Baker in 2022, he started exploring Valley partnerships to cultivate his idea for a heritage grain bagel.
