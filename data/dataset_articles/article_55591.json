Celebrating her 26th year on January 4, 2024, Liza flaunts her edgy charm, embracing a [grunge look](https://www.pep.ph/lifestyle/fashion) that adds a twist to her usual sweet girl image.

Her shimmery and glittery [make-up](https://www.pep.ph/lifestyle/beauty) done by Anthea Bueno, and soft wavy hair styled by Brent Sales, presented a stark contrast to the dark and intriguing set designed by Justine Arcega-Bumanlag. Along with these eye-catching snaps, her caption reflected the [Careless Music](https://www.pep.ph/peptionary/172273/careless-music-a5254-20230327?ref=article_read_also) talent's fearless approach to life. She wrote, \"They say 'You can’t have your cake and eat it too' but life is short so watch me try. Here’s to 26!!\" Liza then shared the back story of the concept photos that were taken a year ago by celebrity photographer [Shaira Luna](https://www.pep.ph/tag/shaira-luna). She revealed, \"Been holding on to these amazing concept photos I shot with the incredible @shairaluna a year ago. \"We were even joking about using them for my [26th birthday post](https://www.pep.ph/lifestyle/celebrations). Jokes on you team, I can finally put these to good use!!! Haha. \"Thank you everyone for the loving messages. Grateful for everyone who makes me feel special by showing their love and support today and everyday! [emoji]\" Before the photos got taken out of context, the 26-year-old actress reminded her fans not to take her middle finger gesture too seriously, clarifying that it was an integral part of the shoot concept. \"Just channeling the [Tumblr](https://www.pep.ph/tag/tumblr) girl angst we all have inside us [laughing with tears emoji],\" she playfully explained.
