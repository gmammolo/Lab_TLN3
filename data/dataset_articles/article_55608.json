  "text": "Chili peppers are a great way to add extra heat to a recipe, but they’re not always spicy. There are 50,000 types of pepper, and some of them are delicious, versatile, nutritious, and, most importantly for those who aren’t huge fans of spice, mild.\nBell peppers, for example, are sweet, slightly tangy, no-heat chili peppers, which are rich in vitamins and fiber. They’re also satisfyingly crunchy when you eat them raw, and they add a beautiful pop of color to your dishes.\nBut if you’re looking for a tasty mild pepper to cook with, bell peppers aren’t your only option. Check out some of our favorite, flavorful peppers to cook with below, plus, we’ve listed some of our go-to vegan recipes.\nIf you’re looking for a guide to some of the spiciest peppers and sauces out there, we’ve also got you covered. Check out our guide\nhere!\n7 popular (and mild!) peppers\nPexels\n1 Bell pepper\nAs mentioned above, bell peppers are the most common and widely used types of peppers, especially in the West (they’re probably what first comes to mind when someone says “pepper”). They’re versatile and mild and come in a range of colors and sizes. The taste can vary slightly based on color—green peppers are slightly bitter, while red, yellow, and orange peppers are sweeter and fruitier.\n2 Piquillo\nThese beak-shaped Spanish peppers are small, sweet, and slightly spicy (fun fact, the name piquillo means “little beak” in Spanish). Originating from Spain’s northern Navarra region, these peppers—which are commonly used in dishes like tapas and salad—are now common all over the world.\nPixabay\n3 Padrón\nAnother small, mild, slightly sweet Spanish pepper, padrón popular in tapas and is often served blistered in olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt. They’re also delicious when stuffed with vegan cream cheese, and you can roast, grill, or chop them into a salsa.\n4 Banana\nBanana peppers are mild, sweet, tangy, and slightly fruity chili peppers, which are often yellow or green. Their crisp, crunchy texture makes the perfect, versatile ingredient for dishes like salads, sandwiches, and stir-fries. You can also pop them on a pizza, or pickle them and enjoy them as a side dish.\nPixabay\n5 Poblano\nThis mild heart-shaped chili pepper originates from Mexico. It’s rich and earthy, but when roasted, its smoky undertones intensify. Poblanos are commonly used in Mexican cuisine—you’ll usually find them in dishes like enchiladas, chiles rellenos, and salsa.\n6 Cherry\nA popular choice for Italian antipasto, cherry peppers are small, round chili peppers with a sweet and tangy taste and a crisp, crunchy texture. They’re also a popular choice for sandwiches, salads, and mezze boards, and they can be pickled and stuffed, too.\nPixabay\n7 Shishito\nThese popular small Japanese chili peppers have a mild, sweet taste. They are often blistered or grilled before they are seasoned with salt, but they are also a great raw addition to salads and they make for a tasty tempura.\nHow to cook with peppers: 9 vegan recipes to try\n1 Vegan Thai-Inspired Red Curry Sweet Potato Soup\nThis hearty Thai-inspired soup combines sweet potato, red curry paste, and coconut milk with bell pepper, mushrooms, and peas for a flavorful, delicious midweek lunchtime dish.
