  "text": "[Rhyme Report](https://www.thehypemagazine.com/category/music/) Published on January 5th, 2024 | by Dr. Jerry Doby0 Vic Shadez Goes “CRAZY” on This Self-Produced Dark Banger New Jersey’s very own wordsmith and beatsmith, Vic Shadez, casts a probing gaze into the enigmatic interplay between reality and perception with his latest musical offering, “CRAZY.” This compelling track serves as the inaugural chapter to his much-anticipated album, TIMETRAVELER, setting a profound tone for introspection within a cacophony of societal chaos. A Darkly Captivating Soundscape and Visuals Shadez, the maestro behind the song’s production, constructs a shadowy auditory landscape that masterfully mirrors the tempestuous journey of the human psyche. The accompanying music video, artfully directed by G.I.FILMS, unveils an eerie film noir aesthetic, inviting viewers into the nebulous realm of liminality. Within this space, the experience of navigating one’s own mental labyrinth amid the relentless deluge of information is vividly portrayed. Challenging the Status Quo In a thought-provoking statement, Shadez revealed, “CRAZY aims to provoke listeners into confronting the nebulous boundary between reality and perception, prompting introspection on the omnipresent question – do our minds teeter on the brink of madness in this inundation of ever-evolving information? They labeled Dave Chapelle and Kanye as ‘crazy’… now, we’re all caught in this chaotic web.” A Provocative Prelude to an Intriguing Journey “CRAZY,” available across all platforms via GIDDT//AVM, not only beckons listeners into a contemplative auditory experience but also lays the groundwork for Shadez’s forthcoming LP, TIMETRAVELER. Promising an enthralling exploration of the human psyche, the [album](https://www.thehypemagazine.com/category/music/) portends a captivating odyssey that pushes the boundaries of musical introspection.
