  "text": "December’s Christmas gifts kept on giving into the new year for Historic Fayette Theater. On Tuesday at their office in Oak Hill, Fayette County Chamber of Commerce/New River Gorge CVB representatives presented officers from the theater group with the proceeds from a December gift-wrapping project undertaken by the business group. According to chamber official Megan Weatherford, the wrapping endeavor resulted in $323 from the Fayette County Chamber of Commerce to be donated toHistoric Fayette Theater. Chamber representatives wrapped 152 Christmas gifts prior to Christmas 2023, she said. It was the second year of the project. In 2022, funds were donated to the Humane Society, said Weatherford. Neither organization requested the funds, Weatherford said. “We knew that people were in need for different things,” she said. While offering a service to members of the community who sometimes might be too busy at Christmas time to wrap gifts for themselves, the service also offers another means of outreach between the Chamber and the local community, said Weatherford. “We were so excited when they reached out and said they’d like to make the donation for us this year,” said Cindy White, president of the HFT Board of Directors. “We have some needs that we’re working toward at the theater, a new HVAC system this summer, and we’re putting in a lot of fundraising efforts to that. “So, this donation was greatly appreciated.” White said replacing the theater’s HVAC system this year is imperative. Other planned work includes wiring, plumbing and other upgrades. Any individuals, organizations or businesses wanting to donate to the theater group to help defray operating expenses can visit [fayettetheater.com](http://fayettetheater.com) or mail checks to P.O. Box 448, Fayetteville, WV 25840. l l l Sharon Bibb, vice-president of the board of directors, also expressed her appreciation for the donation. Bibb is directing the theater’s next production, “Jack and the Giant,” which will take to the stage for three weekends of performances beginning March 8. The initial rehearsal for the production, a vocal rehearsal, occurred Jan. 2. Bibb says she’s excited about the upcoming play. “It’s just going to be a lot of family fun,” she said. “Lots of laughs, just be a good time and get away.”",
