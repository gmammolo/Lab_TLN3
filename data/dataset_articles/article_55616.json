  "text": "In the still of the mornings, I can think better. I am not sure why that is. Perhaps all the years of muscle memory of watching a new day being born, perched high in a treestand or standing atop a ridge in the spring waiting for the owls to hoot and cardinals to burst into their spring chorus competing to see who can sing the loudest, serenading me while I stand there wishing and hoping a turkey would gobble. I must admit, I don’t get the same brain rush indoors when the alarm clock wakes me in the pre-dawn hours. Put me on a plane or in a car traveling down the highway, forget it. That is what the snooze button is for.\nOn my morning hike today, I started in the pitch dark and was shortly greeted by the blue light of pre-dawn — the magical time when the sun is getting close to the horizon, and as hunters, we know it as the first light. In the tranquil few minutes, we absorb the views and thoughts of a new day and serve as a first-hand witness to the optimism outdoorsmen and women often understand better than many other groups of humans.\nAs the sun rises and shows off its ability to turn dark to blue light and then explode with colors of pinks, reds and oranges from its indirect light scattering across the clouds and atmosphere, the world awakes bright, shiny and new. The nocturnal animals drift off to slumber the day away while the daylight creatures welcome the day with movement — oftentimes with what seems only to be labeled as enthusiasm. As hunters, it is a wonderful time to be in the woods or on the water and often the time with increased game animal movement.\nBeing a naturally optimistic group (why else would we get up before light and brave the cold and elements day after day, year after year, and pay for the privilege to do so, in hopes that the targeted species presents itself on that particular day?), not only do we do it happily, but we also allow it to define us as a group of people — people who cherish the lifestyle of being hands-on wildlife conservationists.\nAs a reward, hunters and anglers often get the best front-row seats in the house for the twilight show at daylight (blue hour) and dusk (golden hour). Photographers understand the light as they are hunting, too — only with a camera and lens.\nAs the new year unfolds before us, I am grateful and optimistic. A morning walk in the cold, pre-dawn hours reminded my brain that we truly live in a special state full of outdoor recreational opportunities throughout our four seasons. Sprinkle in a culture, heritage and history of outdoorsmen and women embracing the lifestyle, and the stage is set for all of those who want to enjoy nature’s wonderful bounties and unplug from the modern world to become totally present and immersed in nature.\nI hope that your 2024 is filled with adventures and outings unrivaled in past years. The buck of a lifetime, a limit of squirrels, the monster smallmouth bass, the hidden wild brown trout, the flush of grouse, the chase of a rabbit by a hound, or perhaps he will come in and present himself gobbling the entire way — it’s all out there waiting for you to find it. And, by the way, if your hectic schedule allows, plan to be out there to catch a few sunrises or sunsets. It may bring with it a new perspective. It did for me this very morning.",
