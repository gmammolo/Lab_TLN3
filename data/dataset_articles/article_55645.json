  "text": "Even though many prefer the buzz from a cocktail, “mocktails” can a substitute for those who prefer taste over tipple. Mykiah Oosahwe, of Mary’s Liquor, said he has not noticed many people at the store looking for items to make alcohol-free drinks, but there are a few. Oosahwe said the store has several options for those wanting to go alcohol-free, such as adding a variety of juices, grenadine, tonic water, and other mixers. Whether a customer is wanting to cut down on alcohol consumption or just prefers not to imbibe, Oosahwe said, mocktails can have a similar taste to their spirited counterparts. “For me, personally, I don’t really like the taste of alcohol in my drinks, so I like to dilute the alcohol with a mix or whatever else I’m using. I wouldn’t say there is a big flavor difference between the two,” Oosahwe said. “It’s just all up to whoever makes it.” Paige Sellers, a manager at Ned’s, said the menu at the bar does not list specific mocktails, but she and the rest of the staff will make one by request. Sellers said there is no mocktail customers commonly request. “A lot of the times, they will just ask us to make something – whatever we think, just no alcohol in it,” Sellers said. “Usually, it’s like a cherry Sprite or sometimes it’s just pineapple and cranberry juice with a lime on it, to make it look like [an alcoholic] drink, but it has no alcohol.” Sellers said that at some bars, mocktails can be common, but they’re normally favored by the designated driver of a group or a pregnant woman out with her significant other. Sellers said mocktails are usually cheaper than drinks with alcohol. “If somebody just gets a soda from here, we usually only charge them $1,” Sellers said. “If they’re the designated driver, I don’t charge them anything. I usually give them out for free because we want to promote safe driving.” Sellers advised those wanting to try mocktails to get creative when making them. A simple mocktail can be made with soda water or grenadine, with fruit juices used as a common substitute for alcohol. “Usually, people don’t like just soda water because there is no flavor,” Sellers said. Jennifer Schnitzer, of Riverside Liquor, said a drink her group has made for certain events is an alcohol-free mimosa. Schnitzer said their peach mimosa will have peach juice, prosecco, and Sprite, while the non-alcoholic version is made with a ginger ale substitute. This means the drink will still have the bubbly feel without the prosecco. “The one is going to have a little bit more of an alcohol taste, but the rest of the flavor is the same,” Schnitzer said. “Now you can make them where you can really taste the alcohol and there will be a flavor difference, but most generally, there’s not, because what you’re trying to do is get that flavor of the cocktail itself.” Schnitzer said ginger ale can be a good replacement when making many mocktails. While some people do come in to buy the mocktail ingredients, Schnitzer said Riverside will be pushing to show others how to create non-alcoholic versions via TikTok later this year. When it comes to those who do want a mocktail at an event, Schnitzer said, it can be because the individual is underaged or just prefers not to drink.",
