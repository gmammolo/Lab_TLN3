This week’s selections include a real-life survival tale set on a glacier, a true-crime documentary about the corrupt world of cryptocurrency, and the directorial debut of Schitt’s Creek’s Daniel Levy—as well as dozens of other box-office-busting blockbusters and bona fide classics.\nSo let us not waste any more time. In the first section below, I’ll highlight the best of the best: the ten brand new movies you do not want to miss on Netflix. Then, at the bottom of the article, you’ll find a full list of every single new movie available in the past week. Hopefully you find the one (or two or three) movie(s) that will occupy your watchlist this week.\nThe 10 Best New Movies On Netflix In January 2024 Society of the Snow (2024) Directed by J.A. Bayona (in his first Spanish feature since 2007’s The Orphanage ), Society of the Snow brings to life the chilling true tale of survival following a catastrophic plane crash in the Andes Mountains back in 1972. This true-to-the-real-story film, starring Enzo Vogrincic Roldán, Matías Recalt, and Agustín Pardella, plunges viewers into the aftermath of a catastrophic plane crash, originally compiled by Pablo Vierci's book. Bayona, celebrated for his heartfelt narratives, doesn't avoid the stark truths that the crash survivors faced, including their morally ambiguous choices to endure. In the film, which closed out the 2023 Venice Film Festival, a narrative unfolds that honors our indomitable spirit against harsh trials, captured with stark honesty and profound compassion.\nMORE FOR YOU Why ‘Fargo’ Season 5 Doesn’t Feel Like ‘Fargo’ Anymore James Gunn Comments On Margot Robbie And The Future Of Harley Quinn Here’s What We Know About ‘The White Lotus’ Season 3 As Parker Posey, Jason Isaacs And More Join Cast Mamma Mia! (2008) If you want to combat the frigid, icy season, what better way than diving into the sun-soaked, musical extravaganza of Mamma Mia! , which brings the joyous tunes of ABBA to life. Directed by Phyllida Lloyd, this cheerful film stars Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan in a lighthearted tale of self-discovery set amidst the scenic Greek islands. Amidst the beauty of a Grecian isle, this film unfurls as a jubilant soiree that coaxes you to belt out tunes, sway rhythmically, and warmly welcome life's twists. This film a journey that delights, amuses, and etches a joyful grin even on the most stubborn of faces.\nMalignant (2021) James Wan directed the suspenseful horror film Malignant , led by Annabelle Wallis, which weaves an intriguing and unexpected mystery. Starring Annabelle Wallis, the movie spins a story brimming with unforeseen turns and shadowy revelations. In contrast to the typical scares of horror flicks, \"Malignant\" thrives with its innovative narrative and chilling imagery that conjure an ambiance both eerily disturbing and strangely alluring. For those with a hunger for chilling and reflective horror tales, this film stands out as it demonstrates that the genre retains the power to astonish and captivate viewers in novel, thrilling ways.\nGood Grief (2024) Directed, scripted, and headlined by Dan Levy, Good Grief tenderly delves into the themes of mourning and finding oneself anew. Diverging from his comedic roots, Levy portrays Marc, a man reeling from the sudden death of his husband, Oliver (Luke Evans). Accompanied by his closest friends, Sophie (Ruth Negga) and Thomas (Himesh Patel), Marc embarks on a journey to Paris that unveils truths about love, friendship, and grief. Levy skillfully mixes laughs with true-to-life emotion, showing off his versatility as a creator and performer. The film delves into a deeply personal and somewhat melancholic tale that strikes a chord with those who've wrestled with the tangled threads of grief and self-discovery.\nThose Who Wish Me Dead (2021) In the gripping film Those Who Wish Me Dead , Taylor Sheridan directs Angelina Jolie as she embodies a fearless firefighter grappling with her most intense and intimate battle. The movie isn't just packed with thrills, but also explores the struggles of enduring, seeking forgiveness, and finding inner strength. Jolie's depiction of a character both fragile and tough captivates us, while the stark beauty of the wild backdrop contributes to the movie's unpolished and intense atmosphere. For those drawn to tales that touch the heart as much as they quicken the pulse, this is one not to be overlooked.\nJohn Wick (2014) In John Wick , Keanu Reeves takes the spotlight in a transformative action flick that reshapes the genre by weaving minimalist yet sophisticated combat with a heartfelt quest for retaliation. Keanu Reeves's embodiment of the central character is legendary, merging a composed exterior with dynamic fighting talents. Helmed by Chad Stahelski, the movie's original dance of combat and visionary camera work elevate each duel to a breathtaking visual poem. It's more than a standard action film, as this cinematic accomplishment captivates with its visually striking choreography and emotionally impactful narrative.\nBitconned (2024) Directed by Bryan Storkel, the enthralling film Bitconned plunges into the murky depths of cryptocurrency scams. The documentary spotlights the rise and fall of Centra Tech, a blockchain enterprise built on trickery and broken promises. In his documentary, Storkel deftly constructs a narrative that includes candid conversations with co-founder Ray Trapani, team members, swindled individuals, and the detectives who uncovered their fraudulence—spinning a riveting tale of ambition gone awry in the murky world of business ventures. This documentary is a cautionary tale about the allure and dangers of unregulated financial markets, offering a fascinating glimpse into one of the most notorious scams of the digital age.\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) Directed by Milos Forman, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest emerges as a landmark in the annals of cinema. Jack Nicholson delivers an unforgettable performance as Randle McMurphy, a rebellious spirit challenging the oppressive rules of a mental institution. The movie skillfully mixes a serious storyline with touches of dark humor and sharp observations on society, creating an experience that makes you think as much as it entertains. Individuals clash with the confines of societal structures, brought to life by remarkable portrayals from actors like Louise Fletcher and a young Danny DeVito. The film transcends mere amusement as it delves into the depths of our very essence and defiance, ensuring its timeless appeal to generations with its enduring impact.\nThis is 40 (2012) In This Is 40 , director Judd Apatow takes a humorous yet honest look at the challenges of middle age. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann embody a husband and wife duo (which is loosely based on Apatow’s real-life marriage with Mann) wrestling with the messiness of raising kids, advancing in their work, and coming to terms with getting older. In this flick, the blend of relatable folks and everyday dramas shines through, all spiced up with Apatow's unique brand of humor. The movie offers a raw and honest glimpse into grown-up existence, weaving together moments of humor with genuine, honest emotion.\nThe Equalizer 3 (2023) In The Equalizer 3 , Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington reunite to deliver an adrenaline-fueled thriller. Washington reprises his role as Robert McCall, a former government assassin turned vigilante, now living a quieter life in Southern Italy. However, tranquility is short-lived when McCall uncovers a local mafia threatening his newfound friends. With Dakota Fanning and David Denman on board, the picture weaves nerve-wracking drama with fiery confrontations. Washington's powerful performance and Fuqua's ever-watching eye lift this movie above your usual thrill-ride, marking it a standout for those who love edge-of-your-seat stories with complex characters.\nEvery New Movie on Netflix in January 2024\nJanuary 1: Annabelle (2014); Annie (1982); Antz (1998); Aquaman (2018); Beethoven (1992); Bitconned (2024); Bruce Almighty (2003); BOWKYLION Lanta Concert (2023); Dawn of the Dead (2004); Gravity (2013); How to Train Your Dragon (2010); It’s Complicated (2009); Jackie Brown (1997); John Wick (2014); John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017); John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum (2019); Jurassic Park (1993); The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997); Jurassic Park III (2001); Justice League (2016); Meet the Parents (2000); Meet the Fockers (2004); Little Fockers (2010); Malignant (2021); Mamma Mia!
