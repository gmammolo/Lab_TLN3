  "text": "The nominees for the 97th Academy Awards are here! Donning some eye-catching outfits, “Saturday Night Live”’s Bowen Yang and “Bottoms” actor Rachel Sennott spilled the tea on who’s in and who’s out. Unlike the suspenseful, soapy race for pope that powered best picture nominee “Conclave,” this year’s choices were mostly dull and unsurprising.\nBowen Yang and Rachel Sennott speak onstage during the 97th Oscar nominations announcement at Samuel Goldwyn Theater on Jan. 23 in Beverly Hills, Calif. Handout/The Academy via Getty Images I can’t recall a year where I’ve been less interested in the outcome of the Oscars. But I’ll save most of my kvetching for my Oscar predictions next month. For now, I’ll stick to the details.\nControversial musical “Emilia Pérez” led the pack with 13 nominations, including best picture, director, a history-making actress nomination for Karla Sofia Gascón (the first trans person nominated in this category), supporting actress for Zoe Saldaña, adapted screenplay, and two of the five song nominees.\nAdvertisement\nAdrien Brody in \"The Brutalist.\" A24 Not too far behind was the immigrant drama “The Brutalist.” Not even an AI-based controversy , regarding enhancements made to the film’s Hungarian accents and some generated drawings, could prevent it from receiving 10 nominations, including best picture, actor, supporting actor, supporting actress, and original screenplay. Its earworm of a score also received a nod.\nWith Oscars voters, “Wicked” proved to be, well, popular! The first part of the beloved Broadway musical adaptation also scored 10 nods, including best picture, best actress (Cynthia Erivo), and best supporting actress (Ariana Grande). Alas, “Wicked” apparently directed itself; John M. Chu did not make the cut.\nA movie on my 10-worst list ( “A Complete Unknown” ) and one on my 10-best list ( “Conclave” ) scored eight nominations each. They’re both up for best picture, actor, and supporting actress. If Timothée Chalamet wins, he’ll unseat fellow nominee Adrien Brody as the youngest best actor winner. Methinks the Academy will be calling him by his name come Oscar night.\nI was right when I said one of the DGA nominees would be dropped in favor of nominee Coralie Fargeat ( “The Substance” ), but I had the wrong director! I chose “A Complete Unknown”‘s James Mangold; the unlucky guy was “Conclave” helmer Edward Berger. When Mangold’s name was announced, Bob Dylan appeared in my apartment, pointed at me, and yelled, “How does it F L?!”\nAdvertisement\nIt feels like the worst nomination of the top-of-the-line categories, Bob.\nDemi Moore in \"The Substance.\" Mubi As I predicted, best actress wasn’t big enough for two comebacks OR the best performance of 2024. Comeback story Pamela Anderson and the brilliant Marianne Jean-Baptiste were passed over. Jean-Baptiste’s omission is particularly egregious — but I’m not supposed to be complaining yet! Gore-covered Substance-taker Demi Moore joins Gascón, frontrunner Mikey Madison, Erivo, and surprise nominee Fernanda Torres (“I’m Still Here”).\nDespite its original takes on directing and cinematography, my top choice for best picture of 2024, “Nickel Boys,” failed to score in either category. It did earn a best picture spot, as well as adapted screenplay. Joining the film in the latter category are “A Complete Unknown,” “Conclave,” “Emilia Pérez,” and “Sing Sing.” Clarence Maclin, who should have received a supporting actor nod, made up for it as one of the writers of “Sing Sing.”\nMaclin’s costar, the spectacular Colman Domingo, scored his second consecutive best actor nomination, after last year’s nod for “Rustin.”\nDenzel Washington’s superb, over-the-top work in “Gladiator II” wasn’t enough for a thumbs-up from Oscar voters, but don’t feel too bad for the 10-time nominee and two-time winner. Do feel bad for poor Danielle Deadwyler, who will probably win a future Oscar for a lousy performance — that’s the Oscar way!\nRalph Fiennes, left, and Stanley Tucci in \"Conclave.\" Focus Features Overall, I didn’t do too shabbily in my predictions. I had eight of 10 best picture nominees, missing “The Substance” and the one true surprise of the morning, a nod for Walter Salles’s excellent Brazilian film, “I’m Still Here.”\nOn the same percentage level, I went 4-for-5 in all the acting categories, director, international feature, and adapted screenplay. In original screenplay and animated feature, I got a perfect 5-for-5. My worst showing came in the documentary category — I had 2-for-5 because I put too much stock in the deserving “Dahomey.” Mati Diop’s excellent documentary also missed being nominated for international feature, the second of its two eligible categories.\nAdvertisement",
