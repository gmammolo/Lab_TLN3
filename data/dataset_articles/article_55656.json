  "text": "Jim Jones’ mother wants her son and Cam’ron to finally squash their beef.\nSpeaking with Brandon “Scoop B” Robinson of Scoop B Radio , Nancy Jones expressed her concerns about the two Harlem legends’ ongoing feud.\n“So that’s something where they have to either work it out or don’t work it out and that’s how it is. I hate for it to be like that but sometimes it is what it is,” she continued.\n“I would love for them to get it together even though a little damage has been done. And if it was left up to me, I honestly would call myself stepping in but you know what? They’re two grown men,” Nancy said. “They are not young boys anymore.”\nNancy also recalled Jim and Cam growing up and when they first achieved success in the music industry.\n“Oh I was very happy for them, I told them to be very careful,” Nancy explained. “There were times they would get into little scraps and stuff like that and I would have to come between them and tell them to get it together. Whenever they got into their little disputes, they would get it together but now everybody is grown up and everybody wants their own. Everybody wants this and that, it’s kind of a little rough and hard to where I say ‘I’m going to control anybody.”\n“I don’t want to control nobody and I got tired of the bickering and carrying on, making yourself look like an ass out there to people on TV or Instagram or on the radio,” she added. “I don’t even like Love and Hip-Hop and the way they’re carrying on and stuff like that. Even though we started out like that, Love and Hip Hop wasn’t like it is now. I might as well call it the wrestling ring.”\nThe beef between Jim and Cam reignited “Capo” appeared on Justin Laboy’s Respectfully podcast. Jim said he took issue with how Ma$e allegedly treated Cam when he got his record deal.\n“I watched Ma$e sh*t on Cam and everybody around him. Like, all the time. I was Cam’s man, you heard? Cam and Ma$e were so-called best friends, and grew up together,” Jim explained. “I was there for everything. That’s one thing people can never say, is that I wasn’t there for every single thing.”\nTo kick off the new season of It Is What It I s, Cam attempted to set the record straight about Jim being around Harlem back in the day.\n“You’re a Guardian Angel in designer, n*gga…You are from the Bronx, bro. You are not from Harlem,” Cam said. “I did not grow up with you, my n*gga,” Cam said in his rant.\n“You wasn’t there, n*gga,” Cam continued. “We were super-duper popping in the street. Prior to the Internet. Everybody knew we were about to get a record deal…Basically, you heard our freestyles and you came up to me one day…and you said…‘Yo man, I heard the freestyles. Y’all killing sh*t. My grandmother died if y’all wanna come by and just hang out, y’all could, y’all more than welcome.”\nIn response, Jim has been teasing a possible diss track aimed at Cam and Ma$e.",
