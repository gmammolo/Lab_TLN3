  "text": "Apologies in advance if you’ve already secured your winter coat for this season. You may want to avert your eyes. Why? Well, if you must know, Canadian tastemaker JJJJound and Japanese alpine outerwear stalwart Descente have just announced ‘Chapter 2’ of their two-part collaboration. Suffice to say the second helping of JJJJound x Descente contains (amongst other things) some truly spectacular outerwear.\nThe collection sticks to the monochromatic, minimalistic aesthetic that has become JJJJound’s calling card. Think jet black punctuated by subtle storm blue accents – a nod to the softer blues of the first chapter. Among the highlights is a shell jacket optimised for weather resistance, matching trousers for full-body coverage, and a long shell coat that marries technical expertise with a sleek silhouette. Completing the lineup is a synthetic jean, which adds a tailored edge, and two water-repellent bags: a duffle and a compact passport option. As you might expect from two such labels, it’s a collection engineered for those who value function but prefer not to shout about it.\nJJJJound x Descente: Behind the brands\nFor the uninitiated, JJJJound began life as a digital mood board curated by Justin Saunders, a designer with an eye for timeless simplicity. Over the years, it has evolved into a brand synonymous with quiet luxury, offering collaborations that sell out faster than you can refresh your browser. Descente, meanwhile, is a Japanese sportswear institution with nearly a century of expertise in performance apparel, blending innovative technologies with a clean design language. Together, the two brands find common ground in creating pieces that blur the lines between utility and sophistication.\nChapter 2 feels like a natural evolution of this partnership, appealing to two archetypes: the rugged and active, and the restrained and elegant. Whether you’re layering up for a harsh winter commute or simply looking for a coat that does it all, this collection has it covered.\nThe JJJJound Descente Chapter 2 collection launches on January 23rd at 10 PM EST on JJJJound.com, January 24th at 12 PM JST on Descente’s online store, and January 25th in-store at Descente Blanc Daikanyama. If last year’s collection was anything to go by, you’ll need to act quickly.\nNext up: Ski jacket brands you need to know.",
