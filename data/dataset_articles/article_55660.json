  "text": "Ryan and Lana Rush share practical ways parents can create meaningful mealtimes with their children, to nourish them physically and spiritually. Mealtimes give Christians an opportunity to not only build up their own family, but also to invite others to the table who are outside of their typical circle and show them the love of Christ\nReceive Restore the Table and the audio download of the broadcast \"Creating Meaningful Mealtimes\" for your donation of any amount!\nIf you've listened to any of our podcasts, please give us your feedback.",
