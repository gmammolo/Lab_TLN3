  "text": "Live Salt Drawing by Hannah Quinlivan\nOverview\nOver two days, artist Hannah Quinlivan will create a drawing using salt live in the gallery, inviting visitors to slow down and witness this ephemeral artwork take shape. The salt drawing will be created in response to her work Subaqueous, featured in the exhibition 'Pattern Recognition', and will serve as a meditation on the temporality of feelings — how they form, evolve, and dissolve.\nDates\n24–25 Jan 2025Canberra Contemporary44 Queen Elizabeth Terrace, Parkes, Australian Capital Territory, Australia\nGet DirectionsContacts\nWhen\nNext on today from 11:00am to 9:00pm\nWhere\nPrice\nFree\nAccessibility\nActively welcomes people with access needs.",
