  "text": "“Bucketheads” is LGHL’s men’s basketball podcast, hosted by Connor Lemons and Justin Golba. In every episode, they give you the latest scoop on the Ohio State Buckeyes and everything else happening in college hoops.\nSubscribe: RSS | Apple | Spotify | Google Podcasts | iHeart Radio\nWe are back for episode 146 of the Bucketheads Podcast, and Connor is back from his trip to West Lafayette after being our boots-on-the-ground reporter for the Ohio State Buckeyes’ 73-70 win over No. 11 Purdue at Mackey Arena.\nThe win snapped Ohio State’s three-game losing streak and Purdue’s 26-game home winning streak. At one point in the second half, the Buckeyes went on a 19-2 run after trailing by as many as 16 points. We explain how Ohio State pulled off the win, and the differences between the first and second half.\nPlus, we preview Monday’s game at home against Iowa and discuss where the Buckeyes currently stand in the NCAA Tournament picture.\nRemember to like and subscribe to the podcast wherever you listen, leave a comment, and review!\nConnect with the Podcast:\nTwitter: @BucketheadsLGPN\nConnect with Connor:\nTwitter: @lemons_connor\nConnect with Justin:\nTwitter: @justin_golba",
