  "text": "Ovar Carnival\nOvar Carnival\nEvents\nOrganized since 1952, the Ovar Carnival is one of the biggest tourist events in the region, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.\nThe celebration reaches its apogee in the \"Entrudo\" Parades (\"Fat\" Sunday and Tuesday of Carnival) and in the Magic Night (Monday of Carnival) during which the city is literally invaded by people from all over the country. The preparation of the Parades involves, throughout the year, the extras and their families who themselves perform the masks, costumes, props and floats. All loaded with exoticism, creativity and sense of humour! For about a month, the madness and initiatives multiply that culminate in the Parade of more than 2000 people distributed by Samba Groups and Schools. The colour, the fantasy, the rhythm, the humour and the joy of Carnival invade the streets.\nThe celebration reaches its apogee in the \"Entrudo\" Parades (\"Fat\" Sunday and Tuesday of Carnival) and in the Magic Night (Monday of Carnival) during which the city is literally invaded by people from all over the country.
