  "text": "Torres Vedras Carnival\nTorres Vedras Carnival\nEvents\nColor and joy. Torres Vedras is the perfect destination for those who like Carnival. Here it is celebrated one of the most popular Carnivals in the country.\nOne of the highlights of the celebration is the parade with floats, men dressed up as women and the giant puppets. The interaction between the public and the masked people is largely done by throwing \"cocotes\" (small objects made of paper and sawdust and rubber leftovers) between them.\nOn Saturday night all masked groups participate in the party of masked groups. The music is also local and tries to keep the Portuguese roots.\nThis Carnival is held right in the center of town.\nOne of the highlights of the celebration is the parade with floats, men dressed up as women and the giant puppets.
