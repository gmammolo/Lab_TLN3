It’s one of the days of winter racing that truly can’t be missed. Best of luck and enjoy the races.\nGulfstream Park, Race 12, $1 million Pegasus World Cup Turf Invitational Stakes Presented by Qatar Racing, 4:55 p.m. ET\nA full field of top turf runners will go to post for this Grade 1 going 1 1/8 miles on the turf course. Talent runs deep in this race and the key to finding the top finisher(s) could be the distance, which might prove to be a little too short for some of the top challengers in the field, including morning-line favorites #5 Integration and #7 Nations Pride. As the winner of the 2024 Arlington Million Stakes and the 2023 Canadian International (both Grade 1s at 1 ¼ miles), Nations Pride still might be able to win this race at a distance that is short of optimum, but he won’t be the top pick. The horse to beat will be #3 Mi Hermano Ramon, who is in career-best form and has emerged as one of the West’s top turf horses in this distance range. He won Del Mar’s Grade 2 Seabiscuit Handicap in November and came within a half a length of holding off Johannes last time out when second in the Grade 2 San Gabriel Stakes at [Santa Anita](https://www.americasbestracing.net/tracks/santa-anita-park). Johannes has been nearly unbeatable for the last year and was exiting a close second-place finish in the [FanDuel Breeders' Cup Mile Presented by PDJF](https://www.americasbestracing.net/races/2024-fanduel-breeders-cup-mile-presented-pdjf) in his last race. If Johannes was entered in this race, he would be the favorite. Mi Hermano Ramon finished three-quarters of a length behind Johannes, and he’s listed at bargain 8-1 odds on the morning line. After Mi Hermano Ramon and Nations Pride, the other horse you want on your tickets is #4 [Win for the Money](https://www.americasbestracing.net/horses/win-the-money), who won the Grade 1 [Rogers Woodbine Mile](https://www.americasbestracing.net/races/2024-rogers-woodbine-mile-s) last September and exits a good stakes tune-up on this course in his last race.\nThe Play: Bet on #3 [Mi Hermano Ramon](https://www.americasbestracing.net/horses/mi-hermano-ramon) (8-1) to win and play him in exacta and trifecta boxes with #4 [Win for the Money](https://www.americasbestracing.net/horses/win-the-money) (12-1) and #7 [Nations Pride](https://www.americasbestracing.net/horses/nations-pride-ire) (2-1).\n[Gulfstream Park](http://www.americasbestracing.net/tracks/gulfstream-park), Race 13, $3 million [Pegasus World Cup Invitational Stakes](https://www.americasbestracing.net/races/2025-pegasus-world-cup-invitational-s), 5:40 p.m. ET\nThis weekend’s headline Grade 1 event drew a full field of older horses set to race 1 1/8 miles on the Gulfstream main track for a purse of $3 million. The lineup features #9 [Mystik Dan](https://www.americasbestracing.net/horses/mystik-dan), the winner of the 2024 [Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford Reserve](https://www.americasbestracing.net/races/2024-kentucky-derby-presented-woodford-reserve) who will be making his 4-year-old debut in a tough spot. His name recognition is very likely to make him an underlay and he doesn’t have the recent form to deserve inclusion on your tickets. The other big name in the field is 2023 [Longines Breeders’ Cup Classic](https://www.americasbestracing.net/races/2023-longines-breeders-cup-classic) winner #4 [White Abarrio](https://www.americasbestracing.net/horses/white-abarrio), a horse who has been making his way back into best form lately for Gulfstream’s leading trainer, [Saffie Joseph Jr.](https://www.americasbestracing.net/trainers/saffie-joseph-jr), following a tough first half of 2024 when in the care of a different barn. He suffered a brutal trip when losing Gulfstream’s Grade 3 [Mr. Prospector Stakes](https://www.americasbestracing.net/races/2024-mr-prospector-s) at seven furlongs Dec. 28 but is now prepped and ready for this return to 1 1/8 miles with a record of six wins and a second in eight prior lifetime outings at Gulfstream Park. Gulfstream’s dirt races at this distance have been notorious for a decade of favoring the inside posts, and White Abarrio is well-drawn in post 4. Another contender that will benefit from a good inside post is #2 [Saudi Crown](https://www.americasbestracing.net/horses/saudi-crown), who shows plenty of high speed figures up and down his past performances the last two years. Saudi Crown is fast, and he could loom the controlling speed in this race from an inside draw, which makes him an extraordinarily dangerous threat to go wire-to-wire. The other intriguing challenger in this field is #11 [Locked](https://www.americasbestracing.net/horses/locked), a horse who seemed destined to contend in the 2024 Triple Crown races until an injury temporarily sidetracked his career. He has come back with a vengeance lately, however, with two wins including the Grade 2 [Cigar Mile Handicap Presented by Twinspires.com](https://www.americasbestracing.net/races/2024-cigar-mile-h-presented-twinspirescom). From a better post, he might’ve been the top choice, but even from post 11 it’s impossible to ignore his seemingly unlimited upside.\nThe Play: Bet #4 [White Abarrio](https://www.americasbestracing.net/horses/white-abarrio) (3-1) to win and play him in exacta and trifecta boxes with #2 [Saudi Crown](https://www.americasbestracing.net/horses/saudi-crown) (9-2) and #11 [Locked](https://www.americasbestracing.net/horses/locked) (5-2).",
