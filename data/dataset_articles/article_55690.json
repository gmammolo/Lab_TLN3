  "text": "Something goes bump in the night, and it just so happens to be you. Vampires: Bloodlord Rising positions you as the mysterious overlord in a castle, terrorizing the local region and gradually growing your army of ghouls. Now, with a rebrand, the project is starting to come together as we approach launch.\nFormerly known as Vampire Dynasty, Vampires: Bloodlord Rising is a building game , of sorts, but more ghoulish than most. Once you’ve settled down in Sangavia, it’s time to start expanding your plot of land, and then finding food. Under the cover of night, of course, since sunlight is the enemy.\nEssentially, the sandbox game lets you live out whatever fantasies you’ve had reading Dracula, thinking that his life sounded incredible. The loop involves gradually building up your domain, feasting on locals, and then repeating as your power grows. It’s all appropriately gothic and European – and cozy, if I do say so myself, even if it’s slightly terrifying.\nThe latest trailer demonstrates the architecture that’s possible with enough time and energy. Your very own Bran Castle can be massive, casting a shadow over everyone who lives nearby. Stealth skills provide the means to feed without detection, so long as you don’t get too brave or cocky. You can still be vanquished, don’t forget!\nIt’s the debut project from Mehuman Games, and it’s an ambitious way to make themselves known. There’s plenty of ground here for updates and improvements down the line should the playerbase show up. Given the relative scarcity of great vampire games , they just might.\nVampires: Bloodlord Rising comes out in Steam Early Access later this year. Until then, check out the best zombie games and best open-world games for some more scares and exploration.\nYou can also follow us on Google News for daily PC games news, reviews, and guides, or join our community Discord to stay in the know.",
