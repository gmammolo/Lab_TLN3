  "text": "Bunny Dachs (Courtesy of Bunny Dachs) Bunny Dachs, 33, loves helping seniors age gracefully.\nAfter growing up in Pikesville and attending Bais Yaakov of Baltimore, Dachs received a bachelor of arts degree from Drexel University in health service administration. She then furthered her education at Touro University, where she received a master’s degree in business administration with a focus in health care. Dachs currently owns Bunny’s Home Care, where the mission is “to honor the people who deserve it most.”\nBunny and Yaakov Dachs live in Pikesville with their four children.\nWhat does your job entail?\nWe hire caregivers, home health care aids and certified nursing assistants and we match them up with seniors or really anybody in the community that needs help with any daily living activities. We kind of do matchmaking, matching up the right caregiver with the person who needs those caregiver services.\nWhat’s your favorite part about your job?\nWhen we get feedback from a client or client’s family. Seeing what our matchmaking and our efforts have done to improve the lives of seniors is the best feeling, and seeing how it gives the families of the seniors relief that they have somebody in their life caring for them.\nAll the hard work we do makes it worth it for those moments.\nWhy is this industry so important?\nIt’s really important because, as the baby boomer generation is starting to age, more and more people need help. People are living longer, so they’re needing help longer, either in their homes or in facilities, but a lot of their kids are still working. Some people drop everything in their lives to care for their loved one. It’s beautiful, but not everybody has that luxury capability. They need help and they need someone to help them. It’s super-important because we want seniors to live with dignity. We want them to age with dignity.\nWhat advice do you have for children of seniors who might not know where to turn?\nThey should always call if they see any resource of somebody who can help with any aspect of senior care. Calling doesn’t cost anything. It just costs their time. You don’t know what advice you’re going to get that you didn’t even realize could be helpful for you and your situation. Don’t discredit that; make the phone call. You can call any senior provider and if they don’t have what you need, they usually can refer you to the right person.\nHow would you describe your relationship with Judaism?\nI have a very good relationship with Judaism. I grew up Orthodox. I went to Bais Yaakov, my dad went to yeshiva, my mom’s father was a rabbi in Philadelphia. But we were a very open-minded household. We were unique in that way where even if we grew up Orthodox, we’re still open minded to all different sects of Judaism. I have friends that run the gamut of religiousness and they’re still my friends. Some of them grew up Orthodox, some of them didn’t. I grew up in a very open home. We had people all the time staying at our house. We had people living at our house. We had people coming for every Shabbos meal.\nIt was always a revolving door for people. There was no judgement ever about anybody. It really gave you a good feeling about how we don’t judge each other. We love each other for being Jewish.\nOutside of work, what do you do for fun?\nI love yoga. I like that it’s not just a physical exercise; it’s a mental exercise. It’s better than therapy. You go to yoga and you get to release everything from the day and move your body and be one with your breath. It really is a good mental and physical release from anything that you’re dealing with throughout your day.\nWhat do you like about working in the Baltimore community?\nI love working in the Baltimore community. I like to be able to help people that I have a connection with and other people I get to meet. It’s nice being able to meet new people. People in the Baltimore community are really nice and they’re my people. That’s where I grew up.\nShira Kramer is a freelance writer.",
