  "text": "Marshalls Is Selling a “Vintage-Inspired” $60 Comforter Set That Looks 3x the Price (It’ll Definitely Sell Out!)\nindependentlyselect these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.\nBedding is one of the most effortless ways to give your space a refresh. You don’t have to hang something on the wall or build a piece of furniture; you can simply drape a new quilt or comforter on top of your mattress and call it a day. I find that changing my bedding with the seasons — which is also necessary because my apartment’s temperature fluctuates with the weather — scratches that makeover itch. In fact, I just swapped my festive dark green quilt for a cottagecore-esque pink one, and it’s done wonders in brightening up my small studio.\nStill, I’m always on the lookout for new pieces, particularly budget-friendly ones since I like to switch it up so often. Marshalls is usually one of my first stops, and it just released a Valentine’s Day collection with so many adorable bedding pieces. The heart-printed quilt I found earlier this month already sold out, but there’s another gem that I can’t stop thinking about: this vintage-inspired comforter set. It incorporates an 18th-century trend that’ll give your space a romantic feel all year long — and for just $60, it includes everything you need to make up your bed!\nWhat Is the Rachel Zoe Valentine Toile Comforter Set?\nThis bedding set has it all: a printed comforter, standard-size shams, a decorative pillow, and a four-piece sheet set. That alone makes it worth the price, but its gorgeous look is what really takes it to the next level. In addition to the ruffle lace trim, its vintage appearance is rooted in the showstopping print. It might look familiar if you’re a fan of “Toile de Jouy” patterns like I am. It’s made a comeback in recent years in everything from wallpaper to dishware. Bedding, too, of course.\nUsually shortened as “toile,” this distinct pattern became popular in 18th-century France. One of its first major producers opened a toile factory in Jouy-en-Josas in the Île-de-France, which is where its longer name comes from. Usually, toile depicts a single-color pastoral scene on top of a plain white background, with complex details that draw the eye. The illustration themes can vary, though, like in the case of this Marshalls find. A pink floral graphic spreads across the included comforter, shams, and heart-shaped pillow.\nWhy You’ll Love the Rachel Zoe Valentine Toile Comforter Set\nAs soon as I saw this bedding set, my mind immediately went to LoveShackFancy, which frequently incorporates toile prints into its clothing and homeware. Thankfully, though it shares an ornate, vintage-inspired appearance, Marshalls’ version doesn’t include the hefty price. I would pay $60 for the comforter alone, so when you consider that it includes shams, a pillow, and sheets, it’s even more of a steal. With this single purchase, it’s a one-and-done, and your bed will look more put-together than ever.\nThough the print is bold, the soft and simple color scheme keeps it grounded. Plus, whereas many toile prints show more dense, complicated scenes, this one’s floral take is more versatile and light. Maximalism and vintage lovers, listen up: You’ll want to click the buy button before this set sells out like the heart quilt did! It was gone in days after I spotted it, so I’m calling it now that this set will likely share the same fate.\nBuy: Rachel Zoe Valentine Toile Comforter Set, Full/Queen, $59.99\nApartment Therapy's Home Runs\nGet full reviews of editor-favorite finds sent twice a week to your inbox.",
