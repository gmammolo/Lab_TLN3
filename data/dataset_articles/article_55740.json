Streible is bringing “Gloaming, Nowhere” to the Raleigh Playhouse on Feb. 21 and 22.\nCourtesy photo\nEditor's Pick New York-bound musical making its way to Beckley Jan 23, 2025 3 hrs ago J.S. Streible is bringing “Gloaming, Nowhere” to the Raleigh Playhouse on Feb. 21 and 22.\nCourtesy photo\nFrom the mundane to the beautiful. The sad to the mystical. \"Gloaming, Nowhere\" is precise but unprecious in its Southern Pop telling of a life in Modern Appalachia.\nThe story is spun to us by a storyteller and his bag of tricks as he welcomes us to Nowhere.\nConceived and perfected in Galax, Va., the show, much like its creator, J.S. Streible, has had an unconventional existence. Streible was born in the bosom of Atlanta, adopted and swept up to be raised in the temperate rainforest of the Southern Appalachians. His county was home to “Deliverance” and the beloved “Foxfire” book and magazine series; as well as a filming location for “Hillbilly Elegy” and “Lawless.”\nThe musical’s simple presentation belies its expansive patchwork origins; informed by life as a statistical unicorn, poetry, and doused in the oral traditions of the mountains and the rest of the world.\nStreible has teamed up with his wife, Producer Mackenzie Spivey, to take “Gloaming, Nowhere” to New York City this March for its Drama Desk Award eligible World Premiere at Soho Playhouse, making it one of the most significant works of Appalachian Theatre in the past 50 years, and potentially the first one-person musical on Broadway.\nThough he’s created and is originating the role of The Storyteller, the show is not autobiographical and he fully intends for it to live a full and vibrant life as a musical long after he’s done performing.\n“Gloaming, Nowhere” is coming to town as a part a first look series of performances across Appalachia this February, hitting tour stops such as Galax, Wytheville,Va., and Beckley, with more to be announced soon.\nThe Raleigh Playhouse will welcome \"Gloaming, Nowhere\" to Beckley on Feb. 21 and 22.\n(Runtime is 85 minutes with a 15-minute intermission. Tickets are $20 and available through the Raleigh Playhouse. “Gloaming, Nowhere” is recommended for ages 13 and older.)\nReact to this story:\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n(0 Ratings) Trending Video Latest Photos To view or purchase photos, visit photos.register-herald.com .
