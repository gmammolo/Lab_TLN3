  "text": "WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. — About 300 people lined up outside in the bitter cold—all to make their way into the first Wawa to open in the Williamsport area. Some came as early as 5 a.m. to be first in line to receive free coffee and a t-shirt.\n\"I love Wawa, and I've always grown up with Wawa, and I think it's way better than Sheetz. I just can't wait to have this one open finally,\" said John Swider, Philadelphia.\nCustomers tell Newswatch 16 they're happy to have a staple from their hometowns right in Central Pennsylvania.\n\"I came from New Jersey a very long time ago here, and I lived near Wawa's all my life up until I moved here; we don't have one, and I'm so excited,\" said Bert Hall, Williamsport.\n\"I used to go to Wawa in Jersey every morning, and I was happy to see it come here, so I came here, I got my coffee, I got my t-shirt, I can come here every morning now,\" said William Colon, Williamsport.\n\"Whether it's folks who have moved from the Philadelphia area or folks who travel maybe from Central Pennsylvania over to New Jersey have seen our stores and just how much how they would love to have a Wawa in their community,\" said Alyson Mucha, Wawa Public Relations Lead.\nThe Wawa in Williamsport marks the company's sixth location in Central Pennsylvania.\n\"The reception in Williamsport and in the Central Pennsylvania market overall has been so welcoming, and it feels like we fit right in with Williamsport, and Williamsport fits right in with us,\" said Mucha\nOver the next five years, Wawa plans to open 40 locations in Central Pennsylvania.",
