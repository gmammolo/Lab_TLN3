  "text": "PORTLAND, Maine — If you've ever wanted to experience the magic of live theater up close and personal, \"Every Brilliant Thing\" at The Public Theatre in Lewiston is the show for you. The one-woman show features actress Tarah Flanagan in the lead role, although that character is not named. Despite tackling some pretty tough subject matter, like depression and suicide, Flanagan said the show is a comedy and there really is something for everyone. What makes the production unique are the audience members that will line the stage throughout the entire performance, some of which will even be asked to join Flanagan in telling the story. Here's part of our conversation with Flanagan about the show ahead of opening night: Samantha: Why is the show called \"Every Brilliant Thing? Tarah: Our lead character in the play, her mother, is suffering from depression when she is young. And, because she is little, she thinks that the way to help her mother is to catalog a list of every brilliant thing she can think of in the world. Small things, funny things, absurd things. That is her childlike way of seeking to help her mother but, in doing so, it helps her connect with everything that is beautiful about the world. Samantha: The audience is actually part of the show as well. Tell me a little bit about that. Tarah: First of all, I just want to let people know that it is not frightening. I am an introvert and if I were in an audience and an actor pulled me up on stage, I might be very, very nervous... You can participate or not participate to the degree that you are comfortable. You are always given a choice. We have chairs on the stage and we have chairs in the audience so we can all create community together. Samantha: Gratitude seems to be a keyword in the show and in what unfolds. Is there something specifically that you are grateful for? Tarah: Yes. The first time I worked on this play was six years ago. That was before COVID and I was really used to being in a room with people, really used to rehearsing in person, really used to being live and in person. I thought I was grateful for it, but there's nothing like having something taken away from you to realize how grateful you are for it... Getting to come back to this story with a new sense of how important it is to gather in community... I'm so grateful. The show runs Jan. 24 through Feb. 4, tickets are still available.
