  "text": "Louis Vuitton’s Fall/Winter 2025 Men’s Collection, unveiled at the iconic Cour Carrée du Louvre, proves Pharrell Williams and NIGO are the dream team we didn’t know we needed. Dubbed “Remember the Future,” the collection fuses old-school workwear with Pharrell’s streetwear edge, creating a wearable ode to their shared history. It’s a masterclass in cross-pollination – think archival grit meets Louis Vuitton’s signature savoir-faire. From bold nods to twentieth-century craftsmanship to a forward-thinking LVERS philosophy that celebrates community and creativity, this line is for men who dress with purpose. Future generations, take notes – this is your blueprint.\nEXPLORE ICON’S FAVOURITE LOOKS:\nWATCH THE SHOW HERE:",
