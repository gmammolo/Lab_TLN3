  "text": "By Sloan Piva ,\n20 minutes ago\nHockey fans in New England, rejoice — the Beanpot returns to Boston's TD Garden in 2025, and many have already started to prepare for the semifinal round.\nHeld annually for over 70 years, the two-round tournament features the four major college hockey programs in Boston. But the Beanpot is about more than just competitive sport. It's a source of Boston pride, and the winner each winter earns a full year of bragging rights.\nThe four yearly Beanpot competitors are the Boston University Terriers, Boston College Eagles, Harvard University Crimson, and Northeastern University Huskies (current champions).\nBuy now: Tickets to 2025 Beanpot semifinals on StubHub\nThe semifinals and championship have been played at TD Garden since 1996, except for 2021 when it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The success of the Beanpot has led many other sports to host their own versions, but there can be only one true Beanpot.\nWill Northeastern defend its championship and take down another trophy in 2025?
