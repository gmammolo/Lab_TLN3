  "text": "Where can I order the book in the UK?\nAlongside Amazon, you can order from , and WHSmith.\nIs Comfy available outside of the UK?\nYES! If you are in the US please keep in mind the book is written in Metric and will contain some UK phrases/words you might not be used to (minced beef instead of ground beef, coriander instead of cilantro etc). However, the measurements will easily be converted if you have scales and measuring cups with ml. Having said that I have created a free conversion table with all the conversions and US ingredients that you can print/download if you’d like! If you’re on mobile just click the share/save button then ‘Save To Files’ (here is a black and white version if you’d prefer to not print colour).\nUSA Amazon – Order here (conversions here if needed)\nCanada Amazon – Order here (conversions here if needed)\nAustralia Amazon – Order here\nAustralia other options – Order here\nNew Zealand options – Order here\nMake your comfort food dreams come true with ‘Comfy’\nI’ve poured everything I’ve got into this book and I’m genuinely SO excited to share it with you! It’s built on the back of years of blogging, recipe developing & home cooking and I can safely say it’s my best work to date!!\nComfy is packed with feel-good flavour-loaded dinners that you’ll want to make over and over again. It’s full of the comfiest, most delicious dinners I’ve ever created. Think the ultimate Fish & Chips, Creamy Peppercorn Steak Pasta and Loaded Baked Potato Soup!\nLet me answer some questions!\nI’ll try and preempt some questions, but if you have any more let me know in the comments below!\nHow many of the recipes are new?\nThe majority are completely brand new and written for the cookbook! In fact around 80% of them are completely new, with some of my most popular blog recipes that I had to include.\nWhat kind of recipes are in the book?\nDinners!! All approachable, super-delicious, fail-proof, comfy and full of flavour.\nHere’s a few sneak peek recipes:\n- Burrata Caprese Pasta\n- Cottage Pie Baked Potatoes\n- Easy Bloomer Bread Pizza\n- Brown Butter Gnocchi with Sage and Butternut Squash\n- Soul Soothing Chicken Orzo Soup\n- Roasted Sweet Potato Salad with Poppy Seed Dressing\n- Harissa Halloumi Skewers\n- Katsu Curry\nAre these year-round recipes or just for ‘comfy’ season?\nThese are 100% recipes you can make all year-round. There’s of course lots of recipes that are perfect to tuck into on a cold Winter’s evening (soups, pies, hearty pastas and warming casseroles). But there’s heaps of Spring/Summery recipes too (think burgers, mega salads, tacos, quick dinners, minimal prep dinners, slow-cooker/no-oven dinners).\nAre the recipes easy to make?\nThe skill level is no different for the recipes I post on here and across social media. As with my blog, I made sure that every single recipe (bar 1 or 2) has a notes section and every recipe is as detailed as possible. My publishers were pulling their hair out squeezing in each recipe, but you know how thorough I like to be . Even the bigger recipes are placed across a double page to ensure there’s no missing crucial info. So, in short, I’ve made the recipes as fail-proof as possible!\nDo let me know if you have any other questions in the comments!\nAlso, if you missed any announcements I made across social media I’ll pop the videos below.\nBook Reveal\nCover Reveal\nSneak Peek\nAs I said, if you’ve got any more questions please do let me know in the comments. But for now, I just want to say the biggest thank you. For the comments, the reviews, the likes – everything. I’m so confident that you’ll love this book and I seriously can’t wait for it to make its way to your kitchen. I know it’ll bring you as much joy as it continues to bring me.\nChris x",
