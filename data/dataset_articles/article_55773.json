  "text": "By Karu F. Daniels, New York Daily News ,\n1 hours ago A previously unreleased song by Tina Turner , from her blockbuster 1984 album “ Private Dancer, ” has been rediscovered and was publicly heard for the first time Thursday.\n“ Hot For You Baby ,” recorded at Hollywood’s Capitol Studios in the early ’80s, received its first play on BBC Radio 2 as it hit streaming platforms worldwide.\nWritten by Australian singer John Paul Young — who released the song in 1979 — the up-tempo track was initially meant to be included in Turner’s Grammy-winning opus that yielded hits such as “ What’s Love Got to Do With It ,” “Better Be Good to Me” and the sultry title song.\nThe master tape was presumed lost but reportedly found just in time to be featured on the forthcoming 40th anniversary edition of “Private Dancer.” Due out March 21, the collection will be available in multiple formats and also include other never-before-released tracks, live performances and music videos.\n“Hot For You Baby” is the first posthumous release from Turner, who died in 2023 at age 83.\nThe powerhouse singer, known as the “Queen of Rock & Roll,” influenced many artists — including Mick Jagger, David Bowie and Beyoncé — in a career that dates back to the early 1960s when she was half of the duo Ike and Tina Turner.\nFor more stories, Subscribe to Daily News.\n©2025 New York Daily News.
