He was part of the broadcast team for that show, and Ventura said it would be a regular role with him appearing at all four episodes per year.\nThe next episode is taking place from Frost Bank Center in San Antonio, Texas this Saturday. There hadn’t been much advertising about Ventura appearing on the show, but he confirmed today that he will be there.\n“So very excited for Saturday Night’s Main Event this weekend in San Antonio,” Ventura tweeted. “The Body returns to Texas this Saturday Night!”\nHulk Hogan is featured in WWE’s commercials for this Saturday Night’s Main Event episode. If he appears live, it will be his first time in front of a WWE crowd since being booed at Raw’s Netflix premiere in Los Angeles earlier this month.\nSaturday Night’s Main Event is airing live on both NBC and Peacock starting at 8 p.m. Eastern time this Saturday (January 25). Here is the announced card:\n- World Heavyweight Champion Gunther defends against Jey Uso\n- Women’s World Champion Rhea Ripley defends against Nia Jax\n- Intercontinental Champion Bron Breakker defends against Sheamus\n- Braun Strowman vs. Jacob Fatu\n- Shawn Michaels\nwill be the special enforcerfor a Royal Rumble contract signing between Cody Rhodes and Kevin Owens",
