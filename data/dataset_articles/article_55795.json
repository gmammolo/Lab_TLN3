Matt Jabaut with tickets to the Super Bowl, thanks to[@USAA],[@NFL], and[@AmericanLegion]! He’s given so much for us and I’m honored to help give something back. Can’t wait to see you in NOLA![#SaluteToService][pic.twitter.com/e0Mx1RUkf5]— Drake Maye (@DrakeMaye2)\n[January 23, 2025]\n“It was awesome and a lot of fun getting to surprise Sgt. Matt Jabaut in Portland, Maine, with the news that we were sending him and his fiancé to the Super Bowl,” said New England QB Drake Maye. “Knowing my grandfather served, I have so much respect and gratitude for the men and women who’ve served our country, like Staff Sgt. Jabaut.”\nJabaut served in the U.S. Army as a combat medic from 1997-2005. During his service, he earned the Expert Field Medical Badge, leading medical evacuation and treatment squads. He completed a combat tour in 2002-2003 to Kuwait and Iraq.\nJabaut received two tickets and a trip to Super Bowl 59 in New Orleans. He plans to bring his fiancé Caroline, who served in the Navy, to the big game.\n“I’m so excited to have teamed up with USAA and The American Legion to gift Matt this once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I’m looking forward to seeing him again in New Orleans!”",
