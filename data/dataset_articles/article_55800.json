  "text": "Is The Batman sequel making good progress? Robert Pattinson gives a cheeky reply to fans waiting for an update on the film.\nFans of The Batman are entering into a drought period. Ever since it was announced that the sequel was delayed once again, the internet has been itching for any detail they could find about the project to hold them over until set photos from the production start leaking, or another season of The Penguin gets announced. This even includes speculation that Robert Pattinson might join the mainline DC Universe!\n‘The Brave and the Bold’ Director Comments On Theories That Robert Pattinson Will Be The DC Universe’s Batman\nYet now that Robert Pattinson is on the road to help promote his upcoming film Mickey-17, fans are rabid to ask him anything they can about The Batman sequel. Sadly, it seems even the leading actor is in the dark about his future as the character. However, he did give a small tease that the eyes of his cowl may be changing when he finally makes a return.\n“I haven’t seen anything yet, so I have no idea,” Pattinson told Esquire when asked about the progress of The Batman sequel. “But I think maybe… a little more iris?”\nWhich Batman Actor Smells Best?\nRobert Pattinson doesn’t just have an eye for Batman, he also has the nose for it. In a separate part of the profile to his comments on the sequel, the actor spoke on the audition process for The Batman, revealing that he had to try on multiple different batsuits. According to the star, each one still had a distinct smell from their prior actors baked into the leather.\n“Definitely the scent of the cowl, with Batman – very much. Well, it’s leather. But it’s also a combination – because you’re sealed in a leather mask, but you’re also extremely anxious all the time. And leather is porous, so it really takes on an emotional scent.”\n“When I did the audition for Batman I had to try on all the different cowls [from actors who’d played the role]. Even from 20 years ago, they all still had the scent of each individual actor. It’s kind of strange. I think probably Clooney smelt the best.”\nIt certainly makes sense that Robert Pattinson would try on different batsuits prior to landing his role in The Batman, especially given what fans know about the audition process for the upcoming Superman movie. Though given how long it’s been since they filmed his first outing as the Caped Crusader, Pattinson should hope his stench hasn’t been marinating the whole time!\nThe Batman sequel is currently set to release October 1, 2027.
