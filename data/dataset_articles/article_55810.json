  "text": "Five thousand miles have passed since Torque News began testing\nUniroyal’s Tiger Paw all-season tires. In that time, we’ve had the tires to the shore, the mountains, onto many muddy construction sites, and have traveled over quite a bit of snow and ice. Principal tester Emma Risken reports that the Tiger Paw tires have been outstanding thus far. If you have not read our initial test report on the Uniroyal Tiger Paw tires, please check it out right here.\n“I haven’t had a single issue with the Tiger Paw tires,” reports Ms. Risken. “They are quiet, smooth, provide great traction, and drive smoothly.” Assistant tire tester, Ozzy the chocolate lab, also likes the tires, but only sniffed our hand when asked for more details.\nOur test vehicle is one of New England’s most popular five-passenger crossover SUVs. It features symmetrical all-wheel drive, so starting off in slippery conditions is never an issue. However, all-wheel drive doesn’t help much when turning on snow, and it does nothing to help you stop on ice. Those conditions require a tire you can trust. Not every all-season tire is really cut out to be a tire one can use on deep snow. However, the Uniroyal Tiger Paw has proven to be very capable in winter conditions. Even more important, they have handled this season’s historical cold snap with aplomb.\nOur test vehicle’s fuel economy remains unchanged from its prior tires, which were worn and had lived a full life. We routinely beat the vehicle’s Combined EPA rating. That’s a good indication that the Uniroyal Tiger Paw tires have not reduced this vehicle’s fuel economy.\nWe feel this tire is an excellent match for those who wish to have one set of affordable tires for year-round use. If we were planning a lot of off-road or a lot of deep snow commuting, we might pick a different Michelin or Uniroyal model, but they would likely be more expensive. The Tiger Paw tires were among the most affordable in our price comparison but have certainly matched the expectations of our test team in winter and even over muddy access roads.\nPlease check back in late winter for an update on our long-term test of the Uniroyal Tiger Paw tires.\nUniroyal Tiger Paw Tire Fast Facts:\nSize Tested: 225/55-17\nSpeed Rating - V\nUniform Tire Quality Grade (UTQG): 600 A A\nTire Type - All-Season Touring\nTreadwear Warranty: 65,000 miles\nTread Depth as measured by test driver Emma Risken ~7.39 mm\nExample Price - $138.97 each (Walmart)\nMiles covered in testing thus far = 5,000\nImage Notes: Torque News tire tester Emma Risken contributed the images used in this story.\nReview Note: Uniroyal has provided the tires for this test at no cost. However, the Torque News team paid full price out of pocket for mounting and balancing.\nJohn Goreham is a credentialed New England Motor Press Association member and expert vehicle tester.
