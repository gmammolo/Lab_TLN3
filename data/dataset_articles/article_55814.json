  "text": "No gazpacho allowed: today we’re talking hot soups. As the cold weather sets in, nothing beats the warmth of a soup du jour.\nGrab a spoon and some saltines, and explore Cola’s rich soup scene:\nBackstreets, 2400 Devine St.| A local favorite, Backstreets offers daily homemade soups. Enjoy them in a bread bowl or paired with a Caesar or garden salad.\nBlue Marlin, 1200 Lincoln St. | This Columbia staple serves up Lowcountry classics with a twist, like the rich and creamy She Crab Soup or the hearty New Orleans Seafood Gumbo. Pair your bowl with one of the fresh salads, such as the Fried Green Tomato Salad or Charleston Crab Cake Salad. You can’t go wrong with any pairing.\nBoca Grande Burritos, 4525 Forest Dr. 2-A | Beyond burritos, Boca Grande serves a special three-bean soup this season, available by the cup or bowl.\nCasa Linda’s, 2009 N Beltline Blvd.| Savor the flavors of Sopa de Pollo with marinated chicken in a broth brimming with diced tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and avocado.\nCoa Agaveria Y Cocina, 823-A Lady St. | Coa showcases two unique soups: the Pozole Verde with chicken, hominy, cabbage, radish, onion, and the Sopa Azteca with chicken, panela cheese, chile pasilla, avocado, and crispy tortilla.\nDragon Room, 803 Gervais St. | Slurp up the umami-packed Wagyu Phở, rich Smoked Chicken Ramen, or start your meal with the Miso Soup with grilled tofu and lemon zest.\nDuke’s Pad Thai, 904 Knox Abbott Dr., Cayce | Choose from a variety of soups like Tom Yum, Tom Kha, Miso, or Dumpling, or create your own at its noodle bar.\nKao Thai, 1307 Main St. | Dip into the Tom Kha Chicken, a spicy and tangy coconut soup featuring chicken, tomatoes, mushrooms, galangal root, kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, and cilantro.\nMenkoi Ramen House, 1004 Gervais St. | A favorite spot of both COLAtoday City Editors, Sam goes for the Chicken Ramen with an extra egg and David’s favorite is the Shoyu Ramen with marinated pork, both starting with the Gyoza appetizer.\nPro tip: If you are ordering to-go, you can ask for your noodles and soup to be packaged separately so your noodles stay fresh and al dente until you get home.\nMr. Friendly’s, 2001-A Greene St.| Warm up with one of the rotating soups, like the creamy Roasted Red Pepper-Tomato Bisque with herb goat cheese or the hearty Southwest Chorizo + Black Bean Soup topped with rice and cilantro sour cream.\nNo Name Deli, multiple locations | Try the rotating soup du jour or the classic vegetable soup, perfectly paired with a side of cornbread.\nSoundbites Eatery, 1425 Sumter St.| You know what pairs well with the Notorious B.L.T.? A homemade soup like Spicy Tomato Bisque or the Loaded Potato soup.\nSpotted Salamander, 1531 Richland St.| At Spotted, keeping up with the daily specials is a must. Today, it’s Cajun Cream of Tomato and White Bean Chili—mmm, I’ll take one of each! But tomorrow? It might be the Cheeseburger Soup, a fan favorite you absolutely can’t miss.\nThe Gourmet Shop, 724 Saluda Ave | This Five Points staple, while mostly known for its chicken salad, also offers Tomato Bisque, a long-time favorite.\nThe Other Store, 4130 Bethel Church Rd. | One of Cola’s hidden gems, where you’ll find a variety of soups like corn chowder, chicken noodle, and chicken bog. Watch for gazpacho on the specials board when spring flowers bloom.\nWe know this is just a sample of the soups offered around town, many of these suggested by our readers. If we’re missing your favorite soup, let us know so we can share it with you.",
