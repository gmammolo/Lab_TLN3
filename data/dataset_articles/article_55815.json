  "text": "After several days locked in the ice and sneaux (enough, Elsa!), New Orleans area folks are looking for some fun things to do before Carnival and Super Bowl usher in a new vortex of excitement. Stay warm. Stay tuned and stay active.\nLPO and OperaCréole team up to present the world premiere of a groundbreaking opera Friday at St. Louis Cathedral. \"MORGIANE\" is the 1887 work by New Orleans native Edmond Dédé and is the earliest known full-length opera by a Black American composer. The performance is part of the Historic New Orleans Collection's Musical Louisiana program that includes a lecture at 5 p.m. at the Williams Research Center, 410 Chartres St., and the free performance at 7:30 p.m. Check out more information here.\nThe KREWE MOSAÏQUE takes its sophomore stroll through the French Quarter Saturday at 6 p.m. starting at St. Ann and Rampart streets, then heads down to Bourbon Street and turns left, takes a right at St. Philip Street for a block, takes a right onto Royal Street, a left onto St. Ann and another left on Chartres Street and ending at St. Philip. Look for subkrewes like Krewe de Mayahuel, Mondo Kaya, Krewe of Conus, the Weather Girls, Krewe of Heavenly Bodies, Krewe of Nyades and more. Scroll over here for more information.\nIt's a great day for Great Books, Saturday, that is, when the LPO Symphony Volunteers are at it again — this time in a POP UP BOOK SALE from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the group's new warehouse, 623 Distributors Row, Suite F, in Elmwood. In addition to a selection of fiction, history, religion and cookbooks, the volunteers will be selling artwork.

Winners in 10 categories will be honored Friday at 7 p.m. at the New Orleans Jazz Market at 1436 Oretha Castle Haley Blvd. Big Chief Shaka Zulu will be the speaker, with performances by Saint Amethyst, Trumpeter Andres \"Da Phessah\" Baham and more.

Palms, Pickle, Madison Thomas and Josh Watts. Admission is free. Snag a seat for the side-splitting sounds here.\nIt's ball season but this isn't that kind of a deb ball, it's the 610 STOMPERS DEBUTANTE BALL. At 8 p.m. Saturday, see the 2025 dance moves at the annual fête at The Fillmore, on the second floor of Caesars casino at the foot of Canal Street. The theme is \"610 Movie Night: Be Kind, Rewind,\" and movie attire from the '80s and '90s is encouraged. Enjoy music by Johnny Sketch and the Dirty Notes, a costume contest and late-night pizza. Tickets start at $75. So get into that crop top and jeans or minisuit and thigh-high stockings and head out for the fun.\nHead down to the Bywater and get in on the fun Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. for Bywater Bakery's KING CAKE CELEBRATION. The 9th annual festivity features a huge slice of local talent, including Soul Brass Band, Deacon John and John Boutté. And half of the proceeds from the king cake sales will go to the Ellis Marsalis Center for Music. Make your way over to 3624 Dauphine St. and bite into the fun. Take a taste here.",
