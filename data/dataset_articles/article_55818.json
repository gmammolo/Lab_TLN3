  "text": "id Software has confirmed that Doom: The Dark Ages will be officially released on PC on May 15th. To celebrate this announcement, the team has shared a new trailer that you can find below.\nDoom: The Dark Ages is the prequel to the critically acclaimed Doom (2016) and Doom Eternal. The prequel will tell an epic cinematic story of the Doom Slayer’s rage.\nIn this third installment of the modern Doom series, players will step into the blood-stained boots of the Doom Slayer, in this never-before-seen dark and sinister medieval war against Hell.\nAs we’ve already reported , Doom: The Dark Ages will support Full Ray Tracing/Path Tracing on PC. We can also expect it to support DLSS 4. As such, it will be interesting to test this game on the NVIDIA RTX 5090.\nid Software has also revealed the game’s official PC system requirements. For gaming at 1080p/Low Settings with 60FPS, you’ll need an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X or Intel Core i7 10700K with 16GB of RAM and an NVIDIA RTX 2060 SUPER or AMD RX 6600. Do note that like Indiana Jones, Doom: The Dark Ages will require GPUs that support hardware Ray Tracing. The game will also require 100GB of free disk space.\nThe devs recommend using an AMD Ryzen 7 5700X or Intel Core i7 12700K with 32GB of RAM and an NVIDIA RTX 3080 or AMD RX 6800. With this PC system, you’ll be able to game at 1440p/High Settings with 60FPS.\nFinally, id Software did not reveal any PC requirements for the game’s Full Ray Tracing/Path Tracing. My guess is that NVIDIA will share them at a later date.\nBefore closing, it’s worth noting that the game is priced at 79.99 euros. So, following Dynasty Warriors: Origins example, this is another game that will cost you 80 euros to get. Ouch.\nEnjoy and stay tuned for more!\nDOOM: The Dark Ages | Developer_Direct 2025 (4K) | Coming May 15, 2025\nWatch this video on YouTube Doom: The Dark Ages PC Requirements Minimum:\nRequires a 64-bit processor and operating system OS: Windows 10 64-Bit / Windows 11 64-Bit Processor: AMD Zen 2 or Intel 10th Generation CPU @3.2Ghz with 8 cores / 16 threads or better (examples: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X or better, or Intel Core i7 10700K or better) Memory: 16 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA or AMD hardware Raytracing-capable GPU with 8GB dedicated VRAM or better (examples: NVIDIA RTX 2060 SUPER or better, AMD RX 6600 or better) Storage: 100 GB available space Additional Notes: 1080p / 60 FPS / Low Quality Settings, NVME SSD storage required Recommended:\nRequires a 64-bit processor and operating system OS: Windows 10 64-Bit / Windows 11 64-Bit Processor: AMD Zen 3 or Intel 12th Generation CPU @3.2Ghz with 8 cores / 16 threads or better (examples: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X or better, or Intel Core i7 12700K or better) Memory: 32 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA or AMD hardware Raytracing-capable GPU with 10GB dedicated VRAM or better (examples: NVIDIA RTX 3080 or better, AMD RX 6800 or better) Storage: 100 GB available space Additional Notes: 1440p / 60 FPS / High Quality Settings, NVME SSD storage required",
