  "text": "European Commission announces €153M in humanitarian aid for Ukraine and Moldova\nThis was reported by the European Commission’s press service, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.\nAs noted, millions of Ukrainians are facing freezing temperatures without electricity amid prolonged Russian strikes on energy infrastructure. In response to urgent needs, the EU is allocating an initial €145 million in humanitarian aid for Ukraine “to provide protection assistance, shelter, food, cash assistance, psychosocial support, and access to water and health services.”\nAn additional €8 million will support the accommodation of Ukrainian refugees who have fled the war in Moldova.\nAlongside this humanitarian assistance, the EU has stepped up emergency energy support: “This week, 447 power generators, worth €3.7 million, have been delivered to restore electricity to hospitals, shelters and other critical services. A further 500 generators are now being deployed, all from rescEU strategic reserves, to help keep essential services running.”\nThe EU has been providing humanitarian assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of Russia’s aggression in 2014 and remains actively engaged across the country, prioritizing hard-to-reach areas near the front line in eastern and southern regions.\nSince Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the European Commission has allocated more than €1.4 billion for humanitarian aid programs for Ukraine and Moldova.\nEU-funded humanitarian aid is delivered in partnership with UN agencies, international, and non-governmental organizations. As part of preparations for the 2025–2026 winter season, the largest volume of energy assistance in the history of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) has been deployed, including the dismantling and delivery to Ukraine of the Vilnius thermal power plant in October 2025, the European Commission recalled.\nEU mobilizes additional €50M for Ukraine’s winter energy aid\nSince 2022, the delivery of millions of units of energy equipment to Ukraine has been coordinated, including 10,339 electricity generators, 7,201 transformers, six autotransformers, thousands of electrical components, and millions of energy-efficient LED lighting units.\nOverall, the energy assistance channeled via the UCPM is estimated to provide electricity for over 9 million people in Ukraine\nIn addition to humanitarian aid, the EU is ensuring maximum capacity for electricity exports to Ukraine.\nSince the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, at least €3 billion has been provided to Ukraine for energy security. Overall, EU support for Ukraine since 2022 has amounted to €193.3 billion.\nPhoto: commission.europa.eu",
