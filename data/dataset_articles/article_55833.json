  "text": "PHOENIX--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- University of Phoenix is proud to announce the release of four new episodes of the Degrees of Success™ podcast which showcases the inspiring journeys of its extraordinary alumni. Hosted by University of Phoenix Digital Campaign Manager and doctoral student Freda Richards, the podcast delves into the personal and professional lives of graduates who have overcome challenges and achieved remarkable success. The University, which has more than one million alumni, aims to share these incredible stories with a wider audience through the captivating series.\n“Degrees of Success™ is more than just a podcast; it's a celebration of resilience, ambition, and the incredible journeys of our alumni,” shares Richards. “Each episode is a testament to the power of perseverance and the role education played on their lives and careers. I am honored to share these stories and hope they inspire our listeners as much as they have inspired me.”\nIn the fifth episode of the new series, Matthew Phillips delves into the triumphs and challenges of his career journey. From the start, Phillips exhibited remarkable ambition, balancing a full-time job while launching his franchise business. His early days, filled with twelve-hour workdays and the demands of family responsibilities, taught him valuable lessons. These experiences shaped his unique perspective as he pursued his education at the University of Phoenix. Reflecting on this period, Phillips explains, \"It gave me a different perspective than I would have gotten in a [traditional] classroom. I was learning things that I hadn’t been exposed to through my coursework, which gave me that confidence.\"\nThe podcast, which was launched with the first episodes in November, now features four new episodes – with new episodes released every other week – each sharing a unique and compelling story:\nEpisode 5: Franchise owner to Chief of Staff: Matthew Phillips\nIn this episode, Richards interviews University of Phoenix alum Matthew Phillips, a former franchise owner and current chief of staff with the city of Detroit’s water department. Phillips talks about missed opportunities, his open-heart surgery, becoming the CEO of a large nonprofit, and the challenges of growing his career before earning his degree – as well as what he learned along the way.\nEpisode 6: Public Administration & A Love for Music: Brandon Warren\nRichards talks with University of Phoenix alum Brandon Warren, the associate director of hospital operations at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Warren talks about his journey from growing up in a small town to becoming a leader in healthcare, and his love for playing music.\nEpisode 7: Civil Rights to Police Reform: Patrick Smith\nThis episode features Police Chief Patrick Smith, a University of Phoenix alumnus with a master’s degree in organizational management. Chief Smith shares his incredible journey from growing up in Alabama as the youngest of 13, to serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, to becoming a high-ranking LAPD officer and transforming policing strategies in Birmingham, Alabama.\nEpisode 8: How to Lead with Purpose and Empathy: Dr. Terry Jones\nRichards interviews Dr. Terry Jones, a decorated HR executive and Vice President of Human Resources at the United States Institute of Peace.
