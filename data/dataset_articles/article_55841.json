  "text": "TWO Victoria Country championships across consecutive weekends is a challenge Bendigo athlete Sam Storer is taking on.\nStorer, 32, will be hurdling and jumping at this weekend's field and track titles at Lar Birpa in Flora Hill's Retreat Road.\nThere will be little time to recover from racing in the 400m hurdles and open triple jump as he will make his way to Geelong on February 1 for the Victoria Country Weightlifting championships.\nStorer will be part of a formidable Eaglehawk team which will be aiming to be number one in Victoria Country athletics for an eighth consecutive year.\nAcross recent summers Storer has shown a liking to try various events.\nIt's part of the Hawks' ethos to focus on your best events, but also \"have a go\" at another event or two in a bid to increase the club's points tally in Athletics Victoria Shield League field and track action.\n\"Weightlifting can help increase power and speed, especially for sprinting and field events,\" Storer said.\n\"Run, jump and throw are all about testing speed and strength.\"\nWhether it be at Lar Birpa or in a backyard shed with the Growl Weightlifing Club, Storer puts in plenty of work.\nOn the weightligting front, Storer will show his skill at clean and jerk, and snatch as he competes in the 79kg class at the titles.\nHe will be joined by Growl clubmates Justin Hargreaves, 79kg, and Alex Greening, 99kg, who will compete in the 40-44 years class.\nThe squad will also target the National Masters in May.\nFlex technology by Gym Aware plays a big part in the Growl team's training.\n\"Flex measures maximum intent from rep to rep,\" Storer said.\n\"Weightlifting movements such as power clean, snatch pulls can help rate of force development and measures how quickly you can take the weight from from dead stop to peak force.\n\"There is real-time feedback on average velocity, peak power, and the speed of the bar,\" Storer said.\n\"The lifts we do really test leg and core strength.\n\"Like many sports a personal best, a season best, or both is a great way to gauge success.\"\nTwo key coaches in his weightlifting journey have been Kim Stevens at Crossfit Dauntless and the legendary Paul Coffa.\nThe influence Coffa has had was shown by being the first coach to be inducted to the International Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame.\nStorer is one of more than 540 athletes that Coffa has coached.\nDAILY\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.",
