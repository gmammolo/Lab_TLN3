If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission.We’re calling it: 2025 will be the year that the best powder blushes reign supreme. Unlike their denser sister formulations (as in, creams and liquids ), powder formulas feature buildable pigments and sheer textures that are a breeze to apply, making them more forgiving and beginner-friendly. Just like their creamier counterparts, powder blushes are available in a vast selection of minimal mattes, stunning shimmers, and everything in between, with the benefits of not looking or feeling greasy by mid-day—even if you skip setting powder . Now, enough rambling and more rouging—below, our editors (and a few makeup artists) chat all things powder blush, including application tips and favorite products.",
