  "text": "Working as an actor for three decades, Andrew Scott is one of Ireland's premiere actors, having a variety of roles in movies and TV shows in that time. The Fleabag star got his acting career started by appearing in the stage play Brighton Beach Memoirs before securing his first film role in the 1995 Irish movie, Korea. After appearing in a diverse set of movies and shows through the 90s and 2000s, Andrew Scott's first big breakout role was in Sherlock, the 2010 BBC series based on the famous character.\nAfter that, he added shows like Fleabag, Black Mirror, and His Dark Materials to his name, always bringing his best with every performance. On the film side, he appeared in Spectre, 1917, and All of Us Strangers. His most recent role was in Ripley, the Netflix adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel, The Talented Mr. Ripley. With Wake Up Dead Man, the third Knives Out movie in production, and Richard Linklater's Blue Moon, there is a lot to look forward to for Andrew Scott going forward.\n10 His Dark Materials (2019-2022)\nAndrew Scott as Colonel John Parry / Jopari\nHis Dark Materials\n- Release Date\n- 2019 - 2021\n- Network\n-\nBBC, HBO Max - Directors\n- Tom Hooper\n- Writers\n- Philip Pullman\nBased on author Philip Pullman’s beloved novel trilogy, His Dark Materials is a fantasy/drama television series that follows Lyra, a brave young woman from another world. Lyra’s quest to find her kidnapped friend leads her to uncover a sinister plot of a secret organization, encounter extraordinary beings, and protect dangerous secrets. Lyra will find that her life is inextricably linked with another as they discover they may be the ones to change the world.\nHis Dark Materials is the three-season HBO adaptation of the trilogy of novels of the same name by Philip Pullman. It's a spectacular adaptation, telling the story of a young girl named Lyra who attempts to search for her missing friend before stumbling upon a kidnapping plot that relates to an invisible cosmic dust. It's an incredible fantasy series that brings the stunning source material to life in thrilling fashion, making it a must-watch in Andrew Scott's filmography.\nNovels in the His Dark Materials Trilogy |\n|\n---|---|\nNorthern Lights /The Golden Compass |\n1995 |\nThe Subtle Knife |\n1997 |\nThe Amber Spyglass |\n2000 |\nWhile he might not be a main character in the series, Scott is particularly great as Colonel John Parry, a marine and explorer, and is also known as Dr. Stanislaus Grumman or Jopari in Lyra's world. The character is complex, and Scott navigates his story with nuance given the weighty themes that can be explored in the series.\n9 Locke (2013)\nAndrew Scott as Donal\nLocke\n- Release Date\n- April 25, 2014\n- Runtime\n- 84 Minutes\n- Director\n- Steven Knight\n- Producers\n- Guy Heeley , Joe Wright , Paul Webster , Stuart Ford , David Jourdan\nCast\n-\nIvan Locke\n-\nKatrina (voice)\n-\nDonal (voice)\nLocke is a drama film featuring Tom Hardy as Ivan Locke, a dedicated family man and construction manager. Set entirely within the confines of a car, the story unfolds in real-time over the course of a two-hour drive. Directed by Steven Knight, the film explores themes of responsibility, crisis, and personal reckoning as Ivan attempts to navigate complex personal and professional challenges.\n- Character(s)\n- Ivan Locke , Katrina (voice) , Donal (voice) , Bethan (voice) , Eddie (voice) , Gareth (voice) , Sean (voice) , Sister Margaret (voice) , Cassidy (voice) , PC Davids (voice) , Dr. Gullu (voice) , Gareth's Wife (voice)\nLocke features one of the best performances of Tom Hardy's career, as it revolves around a man named Ivan Locke, a construction manager who drives around conducting a series of phone interviews. What makes Locke special is that Tom Hardy is the only character to appear on-screen, and everyone else (including Andrew Scott) only utilizes their voice during the various phone calls. It's an intimate film that feels more grand than it might let on, and its unique premise really lets it shine.\nRelated\nEvery Tom Hardy Movie, Ranked Worst To Best\nTom Hardy has consistently shown a willingness to make bold acting choices and push the boundaries throughout his illustrious movie career.\nScott was tasked with voicing Donal, Ivan Locke's work trainee who needs Locke to coach him through the preparation of a pour. It's not the most substantial role of his career, but Scott is quite great in it, and his conversation with Locke is engaging despite being a rather mundane thing to talk about. In fact, it's aspects like their mundane conversation that make Locke so appealing.\n8 Ripley (2024)\nAndrew Scott as Tom Ripley\nRipley\n- Release Date\n- 2024 - 2023\n- Showrunner\n- Steven Zaillian\n- Directors\n- Steven Zaillian\n- Writers\n- Steven Zaillian\nCast\n-\nJohnny Flynn\n-\nDakota Fanning\nBased on the novel by Patricia Highsmith, Ripley is a drama-thriller written and created by Steven Zaillian. Set in the 1960s, the series follows Tom Ripley, who is hired to attempt to coax a wealthy man's son to come home - but this job is just the first part of a lengthy and dangerous complex web of lies.\nRipley is Netflix's fantastic attempt to adapt Patricia Highsmith's seminal mystery novel, making it the latest adaptation, while also being the first to be a TV series. Because of that, it works incredibly well, really using the extra time it has to flesh out the characters and explore the engaging mystery at hand to its full depth. Of course, it isn't a one-to-one adaptation, making a number of changes to better suit the medium it is presented in. Still, it's one of the best takes on the novel and one filled with some spectacular performances.\nBoth the star and a producer, Andrew Scott excels at playing the enigmatic man at the center of it all, Tom Ripley. It feels like his take on the character is the most monstrous, with him doing some truly insidious acts throughout the series. It's Scott at his best, and perhaps the greatest interpretation from a character standpoint of Tom Ripley.\n7 Pride (2014)\nAndrew Scott as Gethin Roberts\nYour comment has not been saved\nPride\n- Release Date\n- September 12, 2014\n- Runtime\n- 119 Minutes\n- Director\n- Matthew Warchus\n- Writers\n- Stephen Beresford\nCast\n-\nBill Nighy\n-\nImelda Staunton\n-\nDominic West\nPride is a biographical comedy directed by Matthew Warchus. Set in 1984, Pride centers on gay activists in the UK who are determined to assist miners during their strike of the National Union of Mineworkers. The film stars Bill Nighy, Imelda Staunton, Dominic West, and Patty Considine.\nPride is an effective historical dramedy about LGBTQ+ activists that helped raise money to help families affected by the British miners' strike of 1984. The film is hilarious while still highlighting the similarities and solidarity between various groups of people plagued with different issues. It's empathetic and touching, while being one of Andrew Scott's most underrated films, as it feels so real and vulnerable and equally powerful.\nIt's empathetic and touching, while being one of Andrew Scott's most underrated films.\nScott is particularly amazing in the movie, playing Gethin Roberts. He is the partner of Jonathan Blake, the second person diagnosed with HIV in the UK, and was alienated from his village when he came out to them over a decade ago. It's a powerful performance that packs a dramatic punch that is tragic and beautiful. His performance graciously handles the subject material and is that much better for it.\n6 1917 (2019)\nAndrew Scott as Lieutenant Leslie\n1917\n- Release Date\n- December 25, 2019\n- Runtime\n- 119 minutes\n- Director\n- Sam Mendes\n- Writers\n- Sam Mendes , Krysty Wilson-Cairns\nCast\n-\nTeresa Mahoney\nSet against the backdrop of war-torn France during WWI, 1917 is directed by Sam Mendes and stars George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman as two young British soldiers tasked with delivering a dangerous message to stop an attack that could the lives of thousands of other soldiers at risk. The film uses long takes to make it appear that the entire narrative takes place over the course of two continuous shots. Mark Strong, Colin Firth, and Benedict Cumberbatch also star.\n- Budget\n- $100 million\n- Studio(s)\n- Universal Pictures\n- Distributor(s)\n- Universal Pictures\n1917 is a harrowing look at two British soldiers, and their mission to carry an important message to call off a doomed attack during World War I. Utterly breathtaking throughout, what really makes 1917 shine is the way it employs a one-shot technique throughout the whole film, blending any cuts made seamlessly to make it feel like it was all filmed in one massive take. It's incredibly impressive and mind-blowing from a technical standpoint, but it also can be bleak and heartbreaking at times, showing the horrors of the war at hand.\n1917 was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and won three, including Best Cinematography, which seemed like a no-brainer.\nAndrew Scott doesn't have a massive role in the film, playing Lieutenant Leslie, a worn-down soldier who explains to the two soldiers how to cross no man's land. While it is a small part, Scott is perfect in his role, portraying a weary, exhausted soldier who embodies the bleak situation while giving out possibly life-saving advice in the process.\n5 Black Mirror (2019)\nAndrew Scott as Christopher Michael Gillhaney\nBlack Mirror\n- Release Date\n- December 4, 2011\n- Showrunner\n- Charlie Brooker\n- Directors\n- Charlie Brooker\n- Writers\n-\nCharlie Brooker\n, Kanak Huq\n, Jesse Armstrong\n,\nRashida Jones,Michael Schur, William Bridges\nBlack Mirror is a sci-fi anthology TV series that shows the dark side of life and technology. The series was created by Charlie Brooker, with the first season premiering on British Channel 4 in 2011. Black Mirror is notable for its dark, satirical edge that provides social commentary, particularly in continuously evolving technology. Each episode has a different cast, location, and even reality as it further explores the themes of technological advancement and its potential positives and repercussions of overreliance on it.\n- Seasons\n- 5\n- Story By\n- Charlie Brooker, Michael schur\n- Streaming Service(s)\n-\nNetflix\nBlack Mirror is fantastic television, utilizing its anthology approach to tell horrific, sad, and sometimes hopeful stories revolving around near-future technology and humanity's relationships to it. While some episodes are much better than others, each one feels unique in its own way, with fantastic performances across the board from the plethora of actors that come on board. Over the course of its first six seasons and counting, the tales it weaves are often poignant, effective, and often terrifying.\nRelated\n10 Best Black Mirror Episodes\nBlack Mirror has presented some of the best sci-fi TV episodes in history during its impressive run on Netflix.\nLike most actors who sign up for Black Mirror, Andrew Scott only appears in one episode called \"Smithereens\", playing Christopher Michael Gillhaney, a rideshare driver that takes the intern of a social media company hostage. Scott was nominated for a Primetime Emmy for his performance as he was the true standout of the episode. It might not be the best Black Mirror episode ever, but Scott is phenomenal in it.\n4 Band Of Brothers (2001)\nAndrew Scott as Private John D. Hall\nBand of Brothers\n- Release Date\n- 2001 - 2000\n- Network\n- HBO Max\n- Showrunner\n-\n[Steven Spielberg](/tag/person/steven-spielberg/),[Tom Hanks](/tag/tom-hanks/) - Directors\n-\nRichard Loncraine\n, David Nutter\n,\n[Tom Hanks](/tag/tom-hanks/), David Frankel , Phil Alden Robinson , Mikael Salomon - Writers\n-\nErik Jendresen\n,\n[Tom Hanks](/tag/tom-hanks/), John Orloff , E. Max Frye , Graham Yost , Bruce C. McKenna\nCast\n-\nEion Bailey\n-\nMichael Cudlitz\nBand of Brothers tells the dramatized story of World War II's \"Easy\" company, as they go through training together, participate in major wartime events in Europe, all the way until the end of the war.\nCreated by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, Band of Brothers is one of the [most popular HBO shows of all time](https://screenrant.com/hbo-most-popular-shows-ranked/), and for good reason, since it is also one of the best. Telling the story of Easy Company from their beginnings at boot camp, through to the frontlines of Europe, and into the end of World War II. It's a masterpiece on every level, as it is exhilarating, gut-wrenching, and incredibly hopeful all at the same time.\nBand of Brothers could easily take the top spot on any list, but given that Andrew Scott is only in one episode of the show, it doesn't have the same impact on his filmography as something like Sherlock. Still, Scott is magnificent as Private John D. Hall, supplying men of the Easy Company with TNT to thwart an attack, and is killed by a landmine in the process. Even though his role was brief, Scott made the most of it.\n3 All Of Us Strangers (2023)\nAndrew Scott as Adam\n[\nAll of Us Strangers\n](/db/movie/all-of-us-strangers/)\n- Release Date\n- December 22, 2023\n- Runtime\n- 105 Minutes\n- Director\n- Andrew Haigh\n- Writers\n- Andrew Haigh\n- Producers\nCast\n-\nJamie Bell\nAll of Us Strangers is a dramatic fantasy romance film by writer-director Andrew Haigh. When Adam meets his neighbor, Harry, his routine is interrupted in what he feels is the best possible way as the two begin to develop a relationship. However, Adam's mind begins to slip into the past and a journey back home where suddenly his parents are alive - and look no different than they did thirty years prior.\n- Studio(s)\n- Film4 , TSG Entertainment , Blueprint Pictures\n- Distributor(s)\n- Searchlight Pictures\nAll of Us Strangers is a beautiful and tender fantasy romance film that explores grief through memories of the past. It follows the relationship between a screenwriter and his mysterious neighbor while he draws upon memories of his parents 30 years prior, as if nothing ever happened to them. While All of Us Strangers is bold and creative in its approach, it always chooses to focus on the characters in the middle of the narrative, handling them with grace and giving them depth and complexity.\nIt always chooses to focus on the characters in the middle of the narrative, handling them with grace and giving them depth and complexity.\nAll of Us Strangers features a pair of acting masterclasses with Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal. Scott in particular, is mesmerizing as the lonely screenwriter, Adam, who is drawn to Mescal's Harry. The narrative requires Scott to draw from a variety of emotions, and he does so with ease, making Adam an incredibly complex character who must navigate some life-changing situations.\n2 Sherlock (2010-2017)\nAndrew Scott as James Moriarty\n[\nSherlock\n](/db/tv-show/sherlock/)\n- Release Date\n- 2010 - 2016\n- Network\n-\n[BBC](/tag/bbc-tv/) - Showrunner\n- Steven Moffat\n- Directors\n- Steven Moffat\n- Writers\n-\nSteven Moffat\n, Steve Thompson\n,\n[Mark Gatiss](/tag/person/mark-gatiss/) - Franchise(s)\n-\n[Sherlock Holmes](/tag/franchise/sherlock-holmes/)\nIn this incarnation of Sherlock from creators Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman assume the roles of Sherlock and Watson as they establish their partnership and begin solving strange mysteries throughout the U.K. and beyond. Set in a more 2010's modern setting, Sherlock's eccentric and complex nature is accentuated as he solves seemingly supernatural crimes with unparalleled intellect while struggling to connect with others on a human level. Meanwhile, Watson blogs the stories summarizing their cases while building a strained but caring friendship with his new partner.\n- Seasons\n- 4\n- Story By\n- Steven Moffat\n- Streaming Service(s)\n-\nDis\n,\n[Netflix](/tag/netflix/)\nAt its best, Sherlock is a masterpiece, beautifully telling the story of the iconic character and the various mysteries he attempts to solve throughout the series. Benedict Cumberbatch is a revelation as Sherlock Holmes and the series is a wonderful, modern update to its source material. The chemistry between Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman's Watson was undeniable and one of the biggest reasons for how good the show truly is.\nThere is interest in a fifth season of Sherlock, but at the moment there are no immediate plans.\nThere is a lot to be said about Andrew Scott and his portrayal of Moriarty, the criminal mastermind and foil to Sherlock Holmes. He doesn't have a significant role until season 2, but he shines in every scene that he is in, portraying the character as dangerous and unpredictable, the perfect antagonist for Sherlock Holmes to face off against. He is one of the show's best characters, and Scott is a significant reason for that.\n1 Fleabag (2019)\nAndrew Scott as The Priest\n[\nFleabag\n](/db/tv-show/fleabag/)\n- Release Date\n- 2016 - 2018\n- Network\n-\n[BBC](/tag/bbc-tv/) - Showrunner\n- Phoebe Waller-Bridge\n- Directors\n- Harry Bradbeer\n- Writers\n- Phoebe Waller-Bridge\nCast\n-\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge\n-\nSian Clifford\nCreated by and starring Pheobe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag follows its titular main character through her life in modern-day London. After the death of her best friend and the imminent demise of their joint business venture, the show deals with Fleabag's grief over the loss, her struggle to maintain the business, and her complicated relationships with her immediate family. The show is known for its use of the fourth-wall break and is based on Waller-Bridge's award-winning one-woman show which debuted at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2013.\n- Seasons\n- 2\n- Story By\n- phoebe waller-bridge\n- Streaming Service(s)\n-\n[Amazon Prime Video](/tag/amazon-prime-video/)\nIt's hard to overstate just how amazing Fleabag is, and it is easy to see that it is the best Andrew Scott role that he has ever had. Starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge as \"Fleabag\", the series focuses on the free-spirited woman as she navigates life and love in London while trying her best to cope with a tragedy. What makes Fleabag so special is how witty and insightful it is, with fourth wall-breaking humor that provides running commentary to the audience while never overstaying its welcome.\n[Related\n](/andrew-scott-fleabag-show-watch-after-ripley/)\n[\nAndrew Scott’s 5-Year-Old Amazon Show With 100% On Rotten Tomatoes Is Magnificent To Watch After Ripley\n](/andrew-scott-fleabag-show-watch-after-ripley/)\nAndrew Scott shines in the titular role of Netflix's Ripley show, which is a reminder to watch his 2019 series with 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.\nNot appearing until season 2, Andrew Scott plays the priest, whom Fleabag ends up falling in love with.
