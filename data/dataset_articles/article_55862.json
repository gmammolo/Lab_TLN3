  "text": "7 Towns in Louisiana that Transport You to the Past\nDo you feel the urge to reminisce whenever you come across historical monuments, rural towns, and old-timey homes? Looking to the future is important, but the small towns of Louisiana have a unique way of evoking nostalgia — even for places one has never visited. The Deep South has more to offer than just hot summers; in fact, states like Louisiana were home to many cultures, including the mound builders during the Middle Archaic period. Indeed, the Pelican State is full of things to do, such as exploring the French Quarter in New Orleans, taking a swamp tour, or visiting plantation homes. If you ever feel like enjoying what Louisianians call a king cake while immersing yourself in a slice of history, then this is the place for you. Here are seven Louisiana towns that will transport you to the past.\nNatchitoches\nPronounced NACK-uh-tish, Natchitoches is a name of Native American origin. The town was established in 1714, making it the oldest permanent settlement obtained during the Louisiana Purchase. The land is old and has a rich history, which is highlighted by the Cane River National Heritage Area, which preserves colonial-era plantations and Creole homes. In fact, Front Street is teeming with historic brick buildings that date back to the 1800s. The French and Spanish influences are apparent, and just walking around can take you back hundreds of years, especially if you come across Prudhomme-Rouquier House, the Minor Basilica of Immaculate Conception Church, or the Downtown Historic area in general; all are close to Natchitoches City Park, in case you were also looking to unwind in an open green space.\nSt. Francisville\nA town with breathtaking beauty, a walk around St. Francisville might lead you to Rosedown Plantation, where you can see the well-preserved main house and 28 acres of gardens from the 1830s. The town is a blast from the past, with old buildings like the Myrtles Plantation, built in the late 1700s, but this one is known for its legend of being one of the most haunted homes in America. Other landmarks include the West Feliciana Railroad Depot; once a hub for cotton transport, it is now a historical museum. The pre-Civil War architecture is still quite visible in St. Francisville, but an absolute must-see would be the Audubon State Historic Site, where John James Audubon created dozens of illustrations for his famed \"The Birds of America\" book.\nAbbeville\nHome to St. Mary Magdalen Church, the parish of which was established in 1842, the current Gothic/Romanesque Revival structure was completed in 1911. The town has deep roots in its past. If you find yourself in Abbeville during the first weekend of November, you are in luck. That is when the Giant Omelette Celebration takes place, honoring the legend of Napoleon feeding his army with a massive egg dish. This community is relatively small but full of big surprises. The streetlamps in the downtown area look like 19th-century gas lights and the Vermilion River, once a key trade route for French settlers, runs through the town as well.\nDonaldsonville\nDonaldsonville served as Louisiana’s state capital for a short time in the 1830s, which certainly sparks curiosity to learn more about the town’s history. One can do so at the Donaldsonville Historic District or even at the River Road African American Museum, if one is interested in learning more about the history of Black communities along the Mississippi. A short walk from there, and you will be able to see the Ascension Catholic Church, founded in 1772. It is one of the oldest Catholic congregations in the state. For military history buffs, the Fort Butler Historic Site is also nearby, allowing visitors to explore this key location from the Civil War, marked by a small memorial park.\nMinden\nGerman settlers founded the town in the 1830s, and you will immediately notice the buildings with that iconic 19th-century European design. Minden can quickly transport you to the past, especially with a visit to the Dorcheat Historical Museum; the museum focuses on the area’s history, including the Civil War and industrial development. Speaking of old wars, the Minden Cemetery contains graves dating back to the early 1800s, including those of Confederate soldiers. Finally, when it comes to 20th-century industrial architecture, it is worth exploring the Coca-Cola bottling plant.\nFranklin\nWith many plantation homes still standing as testament, this town was once a sugarcane trade center in the 19th century. The Battle of Irish Bend took place nearby in 1863, and you can find historical markers around that explain the significance of the battle. Walking through Franklin’s Main Street, you will notice the gas lanterns and oak trees draped with Spanish moss. If you keep moving, you might come across the Franklin Historic District, which includes over 400 buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries. Be sure to pass by the town's most important attraction: Shadowlawn, where the main structure was built in 1833 of northern pine. Aside from that, you can take a look around the Grevemberg House Museum where you will feel right at home (if several decades in the past) or take a trip to the nearby Lake Fausse Pointe State Park.\nCovington\nOriginally called Wharton, Covington was established back in 1813. The town hosts the Three Rivers Art Festival annually in November, and its trailhead — simply known as the Covington Trailhead — is used as a starting point for the Tammany Trace, a 31-mile rail trail. With a historic downtown, this community is as rich in history as it is in natural beauty. Visitors and residents alike like to relax at Bogue Falaya Wayside Park and Columbia Street Landing, with its famous Southern Hotel — opened in 1907 — has been restored to its former glory. One can really feel the living history surrounding Covington when passing by historical landmarks like Thornthistle Villa & Farm or the H.J. Smith & Sons General Store & Museum.\nFinal Thoughts\nSeeing one's roots, even when they might not be directly related to one's past, can really change a person's perspective. Louisiana is especially good at doing that with its hallowed grounds and humbling landmarks. Whether you are looking for old battlefields, colonial homes, or just find yourself gazing into the endless fields of green that have been there for millennia, the Bayou State has a way of taking you back and reminding you of the things that once were. Each of the seven towns in Louisiana that will transport you to the past provide a wealth of opportunities for exploration.",
