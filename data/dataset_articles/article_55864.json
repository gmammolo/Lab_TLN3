  "text": "Actor Jin Young (34) once again showed off her presence as \"Suspicious Her.\" This time, it's not as a grandson, it's as a producer.\nKBS2 drama \"The Suspicious Girl\" (played by Heo Seung-min, directed by Park Yong-soon) which ended on the 23rd is a romance music growth drama in which grandmother Oh Mal-soon enjoys her brilliant heyday once again after turning into a 20-year-old Oduri overnight. It is based on the movie \"Suspicious Her\" (2014), which attracted 8.66 million viewers. Jinyoung plays Daniel Han, executive producer of Eunice Entertainment.\nJin-young, who I recently met, said, \"I think it's a really warm drama, so I don't think about anything else and I can enjoy it. There were a lot of cold days, but when it's over, I always feel sad and cool,\" he said.\nFor Jin-young, \"Suspicious Girl\" is a meaningful work. He appeared in a drama after playing the role of his grandson, Oh Mal-soon, in a movie 10 years ago. In particular, in this drama, he played a similar position to Lee Jin-wook in the movie.\nHe said, \"I was in Lee Jin-wook's senior position in the movie. I was worried if I could express this well, but the role was different, so I thought I could change it to my style, so I got to challenge myself. It's been a while since I met Lee Jin-wook while doing \"Sweet Home 2\" with him, and he reminded me of the movie. My senior said, \"Don't care about anything else and show me in your style,\" but it was the most encouraging.\"\nBut soon, \"But actually, every time I watch a movie, I get worried. I think the relaxed vibe from the experience because the senior is cool is an unattainable part. So I thought about how to look cool. I looked for movies and gifs of my seniors,\" he said.\nDebuting in the movie Miss Granny, he led the play as the lead in this film.\nJin-young said, \"It was also touching to be the main character. I thought that's how much time has passed. Ten years is a hell of a time. I felt that time has passed since I came out as a grandson in the movie, but this time I came out as a producer and produced an idol. I was comforted because I thought you lived hard.\"\nHe also said, \"I've dreamed of becoming an actor since I was young. When I was in middle school, I took a bus from Chungju to Seoul on weekends, went to take acting lessons, and went to a lot of auxiliary appearances. I also played a lot of minor roles. There were times when only the back came out, and there were times when it was edited. I longed for my face to come out a little more, and when my face started to come out little by little, I felt that I wanted to say something. There was such a longing, so the more the lines increased, the more joy there was. \"Suspicious Woman\" was a work that felt the change of my decade, so I was deeply moved,\" he said.\nHe said, \"The movie was hectic because it was my debut movie. I was scared and scared of what I was doing. It was a time to learn that acting is like this by watching Na Moon-hee and Shim Eun-kyung. It taught me a lot of lessons. In the drama, I had no choice but to expect Kim Hae-sook and Jung Ji-so's acting skills. I've been impressed since the script reading. They are really different people, but they express themselves without crossing a certain line, and I reflected on myself as I thought, \"Can I do that?\" I had a time to reflect on myself after seeing him do it perfectly,\" he said.\nAs for Jeong Ji-so, who worked with romance, he said, \"He's so nice. That's a wonderful person. I like to be nice to the other actor and talk to them like this. You have no choice but to get close naturally. \"This role is a difficult role and should be liked, but I reflected on it again when I saw Jung Ji-so, who made me feel more and more likeable,\" he praised.\nWe talked a lot about music with each other. Jiso sings better than me, but she asked me a lot. I was talking about my thoughts while practicing singing, and they took it so well. I thought this person was an all-around entertainment. You were so good. I did a musical while filming a drama. When I saw that, I thought he was a person of various charms. It's really great.\"\nSince Jinyoung has been an idol to a producer, he must have been immersed in Daniel Han's character.\nJin-young said, \"I can relate to it because it's a character who was an idol and then a producer. \"I tried to melt my experience,\" he said, \"I'm rough in dramas, but I'm weak-minded. I can't speak ill of myself. When recording, you can say exactly what you want to say, but in fact, there were times when I hated that personality because I couldn't. But when I saw the results later, I think I thought positively because everything doesn't work out just because it works out well by communicating with each other.\"\nIn fact, he said, \"The fans did, too, and I looked up the comments of the program I appeared on, and there was a comment saying, 'Please make it.' I'm getting greedy. There are some parts that are not easy, but I have a dream. If I do it, I'm really confident that I'll do well. It's a dream that sits on the back of my heart. It's a really difficult thing, but I also imagined that there would be nothing that happy if I melted the parts I thought and made them together. I don't know if I'll do it or not, but I'm in the back of my heart,\" he confessed.\nHe said he often looks for public reactions, calling himself a \"strategist style.\"\nJin-young said, \"When I watch dramas or movies, I look for a lot of things. He analyzes the data by himself while looking for all the detailed reactions. During movies and dramas, the production crew asks, \"What do you think the ratings will be tomorrow?\" While working as a producer since he was young, he communicated and communicated with the public. \"I think that if I don't grasp the needs of the public, I'll only fail, so I think I'm getting help from what I've practiced, tried, and seen so far, whether it's a drama or a movie, with that experience,\" he said.\nHe said, \"I am confident that I will persistently grasp what the public will like and what idols will like these days. \"I think I can understand the needs of music and do well according to the concept,\" he said with confidence.\nWhen asked what position Jung Ji-so would have been if he were an idol, he said, \"He's cute and cute, but he's also the main vocalist, so I feel like he's popular. There was such a person when I was a producer. \"He sings well, he's pretty, cute, and charming, so I think he's a popular member that fans like.\"\nJin-young said, \"2024 was a year for 2025,\" adding that he plans to show various sides to his fans in the new year.\nHe said, \"I think I lived rather hard in 2024. He also shot the film \"The Girl We Loved At That Time\" and the original Taiwanese film \"1977, that photo of that year.\" In a way, I wonder if it was the year for 2025. Things that I've been working hard on have continued to come out to the world this year. In a way, it was a year of preparation for 2025. I'm looking forward to how it will respond, he said. \"I'm going to release an album this year. I don't know what form it will be, but it won't be one song,\" he said with a smile.\n[YANG SO YOUNG, reporter of \"Star Today\"]",
