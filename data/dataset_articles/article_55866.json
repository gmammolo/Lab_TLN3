  "text": "Lifeguards are preparing for the huge crowds expected across the Gold Coast over the long weekend.\nThe ongoing heatwave is set to add to the usual Australia Day celebrations, with temperatures around 30 degrees forecast.\nA safety warning has been issued following the drowning death of two people on the Gold Coast already over this holiday period.\nSurf Life Saving Queensland Gold Coast Regional Manager, Nathan Fife, has told myGC they don’t want to see any more tragedies.\n“Unfortunately over long-weekends and public holidays there’s a big increase in rescues and a high percentage of drownings that can occur,” Mr Fife says.\n“We’ve had two drownings over this six-week period, which is two too many. We want people to enjoy it and have fun while celebrating the long weekend and Australia Day, just look out for each other and do it safely.”\nSLSQ has also issued a stern warning to avoid swimming if you’re planning to drink during Australia Day celebrations.\n“If you have been drinking, please stay well away from the water. We’ve got extra roving jetskis out, the Westpac Helicopter will be doing extra flights and we are ready,” Mr Fife says.\n“We just need people to please only swim between the patrolled location between patrolled times of 7am to 6pm.”\nOver the Australia Day long weekend in 2024 there were 34 rescues outside of the flags and one inside the flags on the Gold Coast across the three days.",
