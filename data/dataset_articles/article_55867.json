  "text": "By Will Simmons Danny Connolly ,\n3 hours ago\nPAXTON, Ill. (WCIA) — A Central Illinois woman is looking forward to spending more time with friends and family after working at the same pharmacy in Ford County for half a century.\nPatti Frichtl retired from Paxton’s Hudson Drug Shop on Monday after 50 years.\nFord County Chronicle fights for tax credit meant to save local journalism Andy Hudson, the owner, said she was the architect in redesigning several renovations of the pharmacy and wore many hats working for the drug store.\n“My dad says, a lot of times in the business, the CEO gets all the credit for everything, but the manager is doing all the work,” he told WCIA. “So she’s certainly done a lot of the work in our business and made us look good as business owners over the years and just done pretty much every job description there is in this store for that amount of time.”\nFrichtl will be enjoying her retirement traveling, and is already on vacation.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
