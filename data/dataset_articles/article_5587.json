  "text": "By Corey Irwin ,\n3 hours ago Kevin Winter, Getty Images Motley Crue has won a decisive legal victory over the band’s former guitarist, Mick Mars .\nSince his retirement in 2022, Mars and the Crue have been embroiled in ongoing legal battles. The guitarist claimed his former bandmates were ripping him off financially , and further alleged they colluded to oust him from the band. Meanwhile, Motley Crue claimed Mars was demanding 25% of the band’s touring revenue despite the fact he was no longer in the group — an ultimatum they said went against a previous agreement signed by all of the band’s members.\nDuring the ongoing legal battles, Mars also alleged that Nikki Sixx “did not play a single note on bass” during the band’s 2022 Stadium Tour, something Sixx vehemently denied.\nArbitrator Rules in Favor of Motley Crue In a decision announced today, an independent arbitrator ruled in favor of the band, stating that Mars gave up any right to touring revenue when he quit the band. The guitarist was further ordered to pay more than $750,000 in unrecouped tour advances.\nIn a press release announcing the news, Motley Crue noted “the arbitrator’s ruling not only vindicates the band contractually and financially but also dismantles the public narrative Mars promoted in interviews with major outlets.”\nREAD MORE: 22 Scathing Rock Star Breakup Quotes\nThe band further revealed that Mars “was forced to admit under oath that his statements were false,” regarding the alleged fake performances. “His expert confirmed that the band performed live, and Mars formally recanted his prior claims during sworn testimony.”\n“This dispute was about protecting the integrity and legacy of one of the most successful bands in rock history,” Motley Crue’s legal team declared. “With the arbitrator rejecting every claim and enforcing the parties’ agreements as written, the band has been fully vindicated—legally, financially, and factually.”\nAt time of writing, Mars had not commented on the decision. Motley Crue is slated to embark on a nationwide tour this summer.\nRock's Ugliest Band Breakups Ugly band breakups are a sad fact of life in the world of classic rock – along with death, taxes, hair loss and yes, profitable reunion tours. Gallery Credit: Matthew Wilkening Larry Marano / Ethan Miller, Getty Images Van Halen and Sammy Hagar Even if you can see life with the willfully flamboyant David Lee Roth getting tiring, certainly Van Halen would be able to get along with his replacement, the affable, hard-working Sammy Hagar, right? Well, for about a decade, really well, yeah. But in 1996, Hagar quit or was fired after a series of arguments over movie soundtrack songs, greatest hits albums and most divisively, a secret reunion with Roth. After that reunion and a stint with Extreme frontman Gary Cherone flamed out, Van Halen brought Hagar back into the fold for a 2004 tour that imploded even more spectacularly. Bassist Michael Anthony jumped ship to form Chickenfoot with Hagar, who gleefully lobs verbal grenades at his old bandmates quite regularly. Hulton Archive, Getty Images The Beatles Although they’ve arguably done more to promote peace and harmony than any other rock group — heck, probably than another four people in history — the breakup of the Beatles certainly resulted in its share of public bickering and lawsuits. Paul McCartney broke many fans’ hearts by announcing he was leaving the group in 1970, but reportedly John Lennon had already announced his departure to the band, and all four members had grown frustrated with their roles over the years. The formerly unified (and peerless) songwriting duo soon turned their pens and talents against each other, trading barbs with solo songs such as McCartney’s ‘Too Many People‘ and Lennon’s ‘How Do You Sleep.’ Capricorn The Allman Brothers Band In his book ‘My Cross to Bear,’ Allman Brothers Band founder Gregg Allman minces no words in explaining why the group ousted guitarist Dickey Betts in 2000. Although he somewhat grudgingly gives Betts credit for helping the band survive and even thrive following the twin deaths of his brother Duane and bassist Berry Oakley in the early ’70s, Allman makes it clear that he considered Betts a controlling “bully.” Things came to a head in 2000, with Betts allegedly drunk and ruining a concert: “It was a total trainwreck, and just embarrassing to the rest of us.” The group ordered him out of the band until he cleaned up, and he remained estranged from the band when they split up in 2014. Rick Diamond / Imeh Akpanudosen, Getty Images The Eagles The Eagles were on top of the world in the ’70s, but their talents were nearly overshadowed by their egos. Things came to a head in 1980 during a show in Long Beach, Calif. Glenn Frey recalled that he and guitarist Don Felder were ready to come to blows. The guitarist recalls, “We’re onstage, and Felder looks back at me and says, ‘Only three more songs till I kick your ass, pal.’ And I’m saying, ‘Great. I can’t wait.’ We’re out there singing ‘Best of My Love,’ but inside both of us are thinking, ‘As soon as this is over, I’m gonna kill him.'” The band reunited in 1994 for the ‘Hell Freezes Over’ album and tour, but Felder would once again exit the band in 2001 with a “wrongful termination” suit to follow. The case was finally settled out of court in 2007. Hulton Archive, Getty Images Creedence Clearwater Revival break up Creedence Clearwater Revival started to fall apart behind the scenes in the early ’70s as John Fogerty began to dictate the artistic direction of the group, which didn’t sit well with the rest of the band members. The tensions, combined with a bad record contract, eventually led the group to split. The contract continued to plague Fogerty, as he still owed eight albums to Fantasy Records. He eventually decided to stop recording until his contract was purchased by Geffen 12 years later. Stu Cook and Doug Clifford have toured as Creedence Clearwater Revisited since 1995. Fogerty initially sued to block the usage of the name, but was denied in court. Frazer Harrison / Gabe Palacio, Getty Images Dennis DeYoung Tommy Shaw It was not “the best of times” for Dennis DeYoung and his fellow Styx bandmates when they attempted to reunite for the third time in 1999. Initially, DeYoung was recovering from a viral illness and asked for a delay in touring. The other members decided not to grant him the extra time and essentially voted him out of the group. Lawsuits ensued, with Tommy Shaw and James “JY” Young sealing up the rights to the name, and DeYoung being allowed to tour using “performing the music of Styx” or “formerly of Styx” in his billing. DeYoung has stated he would be open to a reunion, while Shaw has said that a reunion “was not realistic.” MJ Kim, Getty Images Pink Floyd It was the unthinkable. Roger Waters, the creative force behind Pink Floyd‘s ‘The Wall,’ was left out of the band’s mid-80s reunion. The group initially split in 1983, but David Gilmour and Nick Mason got the itch to reunite two years later. They added exiled keyboardist Richard Wright, which left one stumbling block: Waters was intent on pursuing his solo career and wasn’t happy that his bandmates were attempting to continue with or without him. He took them to court in 1985 over the usage of the band name and past material. Eventually the suit was settled out of court. The relationship remained damaged until 2005 when the members reunited onstage at Live 8, but things are still a little prickly. Waters has taken ‘The Wall,’ in its entirety, to the concert stage, while Gilmour and Mason (Wright died in 2008) called it quits after releasing 'The Endless River' in 2014. Chris Walter, Getty Images Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne Black Sabbath were metal’s pioneering band, but as the ’70s gave way to the ’80s things started to sour amidst the rock outfit. Ozzy Osbourne told The Guardian that the band members were barely talking by 1979, and their performances started to suffer under the heavy cloud of drug and alcohol use. “We tried to manage ourselves for a while, but we were always at the bar,” recalled Osbourne. “We were sick of each other — you don’t even want to be around your wife all the time and you married her. And none of us wanted to drag the black magic s— around forever.” Years later and much cleaner, Osbourne and his Black Sabbath bandmates have resumed their career together, albeit without drummer Bill Ward. Marc S. Canter, Getty Images Guns N’ Roses The breakup of the original lineup of Guns N Roses was — in fact, still is — one of the most drawn-out and hotly contested band divorces in rock history. Axl Rose, Slash, Duff McKagan, Steven Adler and Izzy Stradlin conquered the world with their 1987 masterpiece ‘Appetite for Destruction,’ but Adler was kicked out due to substance abuse battles before the recording of their twin 1991 ‘Use Your Illusion’ follow-ups, and Stradlin left during their next tour. A few years later, Slash and McKagan left amid clashes with Rose over the band’s creative direction, leaving the singer to front a rotating cast of musicians that touring the world before Slash and McKagan rejoined the band in 2016. Theo Wargo, Getty Images Van Halen and David Lee Roth We already discussed Sammy Hagar‘s twin departures from Van Halen, but the shockwaves from those splits were minor compared to the earthquake that erupted when it was announced that original singer David Lee Roth was leaving the band in 1985. It seems the Van Halen brothers were sick of Roth’s stage persona and mad at him for focusing on his covers EP and planned film career, while he was tired of guitarist Eddie Van Halen’s substance abuse and unauthorized guest spots on outside albums. Van Halen with Hagar eventually won the dueling career battle, but after nearly three decades and some aborted reconciliation attempts Roth and Van Halen reunited seemingly for good in 2007. Michael Anthony? Well, that’s another story...",
