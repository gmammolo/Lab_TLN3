  "text": "MIDLAND, Texas — Cinergy is set to work on plans for a redevelopment at its newest location, the former Regal Tall City at 4915 Loop 250 Frontage Road in Midland , according to a news release from Scandal Co-Active Laura McGregor.\nMcGregor said this new venue will be bringing \"a bold new vision to life.\"\n\"This transformative project will reimagine the entire space, creating a next-generation entertainment destination that promises something for everyone,\" said McGregor.\nHere are what McGregor said are the highlights of the renovation:\nAll auditoriums will be remodeled, feature upgraded seating and cutting-edge projection and sound systems for a crazy cinematic experience. \"Some auditoriums will be repurposed to make room for exciting attractions. Imagine a “Dave & Buster’s on steroids,” featuring state-of-the-art escape rooms, bowling lanes, arcade games, and a dynamic restaurant and bar area.\" \"A completely revamped exterior will dramatically enhance the location's curb appeal and set the tone for the immersive experiences inside.\" But now even more exciting, Cinergy is to consider expanding to bring a \"pro-style premium indoor go-kart racing to Midland.\" These plans include \"two three-level ¼-mile-long indoor tracks designed for high-speed thrills,\" McGregor said.\nWith these inclusions, these tracks will be complete with high performance karts requiring helmets, challenging fast-paced tracks and even racing simulators and a spectacular lighting system.\nMcGregor stated \"this facility will rival top attractions like Andretti Indoor Karting and will provide the most premium karting experience between Dallas and Denver.\"\nCinergy is collaborating with Midland officials and the Midland Development Corporation to make this vision a reality.\n\"This is a big project, and we'll need significant support to bring it to life,\" said McGregor.\nClose Ad",
