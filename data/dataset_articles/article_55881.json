  "text": "The People of Pitti #107 have spoken, and they are screaming to the masses: ”Pick an accessory and own the room with it or, in this case, the pavilion!” This was obvious in everything from handmade eyewear and small and too-big carry-all bags with fun detailing to winter accessories that demanded their own conversation. All the best Pitti goers had one or two accessories that made their outfits feel just a little bit more special and buzz-worthy.\nAnd if you haven’t rewatched your favorite western film, do it today! The aces were high and the Pitti partners were in full yee-haw core. Ten-gallon cowboy hats and hand tooled belts were outfitted with western inspired ponchos and sweaters that all felt reminiscent of scenes from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. There were so many interpretations of yee-haw core and everyone mastered it in their own way.\nPitti #107 told us that dressing is becoming less trend driven and more personal. More and more consumers are creating their own universe of style and owning that style with conviction. Retailers will certainly need to saddle up and recognize that within the scope of men’s lies less trend and more individuality. Can retailers adjust and make selections based on that?",
