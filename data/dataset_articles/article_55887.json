  "text": "It would be inaccurate to call this nourishing soup an authentic Vietnamese pho. The essence of pho is a broth simmered for an entire day, typically made from beef or chicken bones. A handful of whole spices, such as star anise, cinnamon, cloves, and coriander, mingle with the stock, infusing the soup with layers of flavor and fragrance. The broth is then ladled into deep, wide bowls filled with rice noodles and strips of beef, chicken, or perhaps tofu. A slew of fresh garnishes and bowls of spicy condiments accompany the soup, ready for dipping and scattering over the steamy bowl.\nIt’s understandable that a piping hot bowl of pho is a meal to be craved, especially on a cold winter evening. It’s also predictable that cravings can strike unannounced and without mercy, inconsiderate of convenience and when you are least prepared. In these urgent moments, the solution is to improvise.\nThis simple soup is an easy weeknight dish that mimics a pho without the loving labor of time that would make it truly authentic. It relies on a prepared or store-bought stock simmered with a few toasted aromatics to build flavor in a quickly assembled soup. You might call it a faux pho.\nVietnamese Chicken and Rice Noodle Soup\nActive Time: 45 minutes Total Time: 45 minutes- 1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as grapeseed\n- 1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped\n- 1 (2-inch) knob of fresh ginger, coarsely chopped\n- 6 cloves\n- 2 star anise pods\n- 1 (2-inch) stick cinnamon\n- 1 teaspoon whole coriander seeds\n- 1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns\n- 6 cups chicken stock\n- 1 tablespoon fish sauce\n- 1 tablespoon light brown sugar\n- 1 teaspoon kosher salt\n- 8 ounces vermicelli rice noodles\n- 2 to 3 cups shredded cooked chicken meat\n- 3 scallions, white and green parts thinly sliced\n- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves\n- Sliced red or green jalapeño peppers\n- Mung bean sprouts\n- Fresh mint, cilantro, or Thai basil leaves and sprigs\n- Lime wedges\n- Sriracha\n- Hoisin sauce\nWhile the soup is simmering, cook and drain the noodles according to the package directions.\nStrain the soup through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean pot. Add the chicken to the soup and simmer over medium-low until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning if needed.\nDivide the noodles among large serving bowls. Sprinkle an even amount of scallions and cilantro over the noodles. Ladle the soup into the bowls. Serve with the garnishes.",
