  "text": "The Canadian Opera Company (COC) has joined forces with Uber Canada to make opera more accessible in the country. The collaboration comes as the COC kicks off its winter 2025 season, which includes the anticipated productions of Madama Butterfly and La Reine-garçon .\nAs part of the deal, COC is offering transportation discounts for guests attending the winter season at Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts. Winter season opera ticket holders will be eligible for up to 50% off their Uber ride to and from the centre, with a maximum discount of $20 off per ride. The discount code will be provided directly to ticket buyers through reminder emails prior to the shows.\nEric Yeung, VP marketing at COC, tells MiC that the company is rolling out digital ads and social media campaigns to make sure their audiences are aware of the discounts. In addition, the partnership is being promoted directly to COC partners and customers through emails. While there will be no ads on the Uber app itself, Yeung says the media plan will help reach a wider audience – including active Uber users – and enhance the attendees’ experience.\n“A common challenge for many patrons is the logistics of safe transport to and from performances, and through this collaboration, we’re providing a convenient, affordable, and reliable transportation option to help remove that potential barrier,” Yeung says. “This initiative is closely aligned with our continued mission to breaking down barriers to the arts, whether for lifelong opera enthusiasts or first-time attendees. By ensuring a seamless journey to and from the Four Seasons Centre, we aim to create a more accessible, enjoyable experience for everyone and foster a broader, more inclusive community.”\nUber Canada’s marketing approach has focused on forging partnerships with diverse organizations across the country, aiming to promote culture, community and social impact. The company has partnered with Somali Together to provide ride-sharing services to Somali youth in the GTA; the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business to support programs for Indigenous entrepreneurs; Ontario and British Columbia cannabis retailers to provide safe and convenient cannabis delivery; Operation Red Nose, matching driver tips to help combat drunk driving during the holiday season; and Hope Air to increase Canadians’ access to healthcare. That partnership provides transportation, lodging and meals to patients.",
