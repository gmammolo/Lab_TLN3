  "text": "Quiz competition series “The 1% Club” has been renewed for a second season, which will air on Fox after previously streaming on Amazon Prime Video. Joel McHale will host Season 2, taking over from Patton Oswalt.\nEach episode of “The 1% Club” begins with 100 contestants who face elimination as they answer a series of questions meant to measure logic, reasoning skills and common sense. They strive to make it to the end and win a $100,000 prize by answering a question only 1% of the country can get right.\nBased on an international format created by Dean Nabarro and Andy Auerbach, “The 1% Club” is produced by BBC Studios Los Angeles Productions and Magnum Media, with BBC Studios distributing. Executive producers include Nabarro and Auerbacfor Magnum as well as Ryan O’Dowd and Krystal Whitney for BBC. Wes Kauble serves as showrunner. The original version of “The 1% Club” began airing on the U.K.’s ITV in 2022, and BBC has since launched the format in Netherlands, Australia, Germany, France, Israel, Spain, Turkey, Mexico, Greece, Ukraine and Hungary along with the U.S.\nMcHale is best known for leading the NBC sitcom “Community” as Jeff Winger from 2009 to 2015, as well as for hosting several unscripted programs, most notably “The Soup” on E! from 2004 to 2015. Currently, he hosts the E! reality competition series “House of Villains” and Fox’s baking competition series “Crime Scene Kitchen.” He also stars as Frank Shaw in the Fox sitcom “Animal Control,” which is currently on its third season.\nMcHale is repped by UTA, Ziffren Brittenham and Johnson Shapiro Slewett Kole.\n“Joel’s outstanding comedic timing and hosting charm already make him a standout talent here at Fox, and now — building on “The 1% Club”‘s strong first year on the network — we’re bringing his unrivaled energy, irreverence and charisma to Season 2,” said Michael Thorn, president of Fox Television Network. “We look forward to expanding on our successful relationship with Joel and continuing our partnership with the incredible production teams at BBC Studios and Magnum.”\n“I am 1,000,000% excited to be partnering with Fox to host “The 1% Club,” said Joel McHale. “I absolutely love the show and love the game play to the 10 𝑥 and guarantee my hair, makeup and wardrobe will look great at least 68% of the time.”\n“99% of us are unfortunately not as funny as Joel McHale, which makes him the perfect host for ‘The 1% Club.’ His unmatched approach to comedy is innately unpredictable and will take audiences on a thrill-ride as they watch him in action with our contestants, striving to put their wits to the test,” said Ryan O’Dowd, president of unscripted at BBC Studios Los Angeles Productions . “’The 1% Club’ has proven to be a massive global hit, and we couldn’t be more thrilled to partner with Rob Wade, Michael Thorn and the talented and passionate team at Fox who believe in this show and in our shared vision for this new season.”",
