  "text": "Developer: Tax subsidy would help RenCen create ‘Navy Pier-like’ destination\n- A $1.6 billion plan to remake the Renaissance Center prompted a backlash because it sought $350 million of public money\n- A Bedrock executive said it was a ‘mistake’ to emphasize public funding\n- Public money would only fund public improvements to the site, he said, instead of demolition or other costs\nDETROIT — A top aide to billionaire Dan Gilbert is taking blame for the public backlash against a $1.6 billion plan to redevelop the Renaissance Center, saying messaging for the rollout last year could have been better.\nRather than focusing on a $350 million public subsidy sought for the project, the rollout should have focused on how the project will benefit Michigan and downtown Detroit.\n“It was … a mistake on my part, to talk about it from ‘this is the number,’ “\nJared Fleisher, vice president of government affairs for the Rock Family of Companies, said Thursday at the Detroit Policy Conference at Motor City Casino.\nFleisher said he should have emphasized “the use of the funds” for the plan to demolish two towers, convert offices into housing and create a “Navy Pier-like family-friendly entertainment destination” along the Detroit River. He was referring to the Chicago landmark.\n“No one is seeking funding for demolition, and no one is seeking an upfront check from the state for the proposed redevelopment,” Fleisher told Bridge in a statement.\nRelated:\nGeneral Motors Corp. owns the RenCen and plans to exit its corporate headquarters for the Gilbert-developed Hudson’s Detroit skyscraper, compounding vacancy problems at the nearly 50-year-old complex.\nGM is partnering with Rock subsidiary Bedrock on the redevelopment project that seeks $250 million in tax capture reimbursement from the state and another $100 million contribution from the Detroit Downtown Development Authority.\nSupporters say the rehab will give a boost to a property that is rapidly becoming obsolete, empty and dragging an emergent downtown.\nCritics say the public money request is an affront to taxpayers who have already subsidized both companies.\nFleisher and David Massaron, GM’s vice president of infrastructure, spoke at the conference organized by the Detroit Regional Chamber. The speech drew a capacity crowd, even though it was the first scheduled session of the conference and traffic was slowed by overnight snow.\n“This is something that's top of mind, not just for Detroiters, but people from across the region,” said moderator Brad Williams, vice president of political affairs for the chamber.\nThe public funding would allow development of the planned public space expansion, Fleisher said, made possible by the demolition of the two towers closest to the Detroit River.\nThe primary use of the public funds would address “about $137 million of purely public space as part of this project,” Fleisher said.\nMore would aid redoing the intersection of the RenCen and Jefferson Avenue, which resembles “a game of Frogger” for pedestrians, said Fleisher, referring to the 1980s arcade game.\nThe resulting promenade would be “truly public infrastructure,” he said.\nThe state funding would come from the Transformational Brownfield Plan, created in 2017 after lobbying by Gilbert for tax reimbursement for large-scale redevelopments of obsolete property.\nUnder that financing, Bedrock would not receive up-front funding; instead, taxes generated by the redevelopment would cover a portion of the costs.\nWhile General Motors has reduced staffing to fewer than 1,000 workers from 6,000 about 15 years ago, the vacancy issues at the RenCen are “not just GM,” Massaron said.\nHe said the RenCen is tough to design because of its uniqueness, with circular walkways, concrete walls and Brutalist architecture. The automaker had tried for years to come up with a redevelopment plan before it connected to Bedrock.\nThe bulk of the buildings include “traditional office space that needs tremendous investment to be functional,” Massaron said. Post-COVID, very few tenants would seek that kind of space, he said.\nBusiness Watch\nCovering the intersection of business and policy, and informing Michigan employers and workers on the long road back from coronavirus.\nAbout Business WatchSubscribeShare tips and questionswith Bridge Business Editor Paula Gardner\nThanks to our Business Watch sponsors.\nSupport Bridge's nonprofit civic journalism.
