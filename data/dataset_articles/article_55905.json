  "text": "Me and my mum had both never ran more than 5km before and we were up for a challenge in 2024 and after the loss of my friend Mia we decided to sign up for the Manchester Half Marathon in memory of Mia Jennings. In order to prepare for the half marathon we managed to do a lot of training both in the gym and outside doing various distances. We were both very nervous to run and when it came to race day it was very emotional too. With both me and my mum training hard we managed to complete the half marathon and we managed to raise over £300. And I have managed to find myself running at every opportunity and I’ve since signed up for a few more running events. Thank you so much to everyone that supported us!!",
