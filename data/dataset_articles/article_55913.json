  "text": "LOS ANGELES, United States: Transgender cartel musical “Emilia Perez” topped this year´s Oscar nominations, earning 13 nods in an announcement on Thursday postponed by the devastating Los Angeles wildfires.\nFrench director Jacques Audiard´s Mexico-set movie, released by Netflix, shattered the record for the most Academy Award nominations for a non-English-language film. It was followed by epic immigrant saga “The Brutalist,” and show-stopping Broadway adaptation “Wicked,” which each picked up 10 nominations.\nBob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown” and Vatican thriller “Conclave” bagged eight nods apiece. “Emilia Perez,” in which a narco boss transitions to life as a woman and turns her back on crime, picked up nods for best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay and best international film, as well as multiple song, score and sound nods.\nAudiard told AFP on Thursday that he was “extremely thrilled” by the sweeping recognition. The movie´s star Karla Sofia Gascon became the first openly trans acting nominee in best actress, and Zoe Saldana was nominated for best supporting actress.\nTheir more famous co-star, Selena Gomez, who has been criticised for her Spanish-language dialogue, missed out. Nevertheless, the film easily surpassed the record for the most nominations for a non-English-language movie -- previously held by “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” and “Roma,” each with 10.\nFor best actor, firm favourite Adrien Brody was nominated for “The Brutalist” along with Timothee Chalamet (“A Complete Unknown”), Ralph Fiennes (“Conclave”) and Colman Domingo (“Sing Sing”).\nJeremy Strong, who plays the youthful Trump´s sinister mentor Roy Cohn, was also nominated for his supporting role, edging out the likes of Denzel Washington (“Gladiator II”). Meanwhile, in an intense race for best actress, A-listers Angelina Jolie and Nicole Kidman -- who went all-out with their performances in “Maria” and “Babygirl,” respectively -- missed the cut.\nInstead, comeback queen Demi Moore, who charmed the industry with her Golden Globes acceptance speech for satirical body-horror “The Substance,” was nominated and is seen as the favorite.Audiard was joined in the best director running by fellow French filmmaker Coralie Fargeat for “The Substance.”The only woman nominated in her category, Fargeat told AFP it would give other female filmmakers “confidence” and “hope.””The most touching messages that I´ve received are from young women directors. It gives confidence, strength and role models,” she said.The Los Angeles wildfires have cast a somber shadow on this year´s Oscars.”This has certainly been a difficult time for Los Angeles, where many members of our film community industry work and live,” said Academy present Janet Yang at the start of Thursday´s announcement.",
