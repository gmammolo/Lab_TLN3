  "text": "First look: Universal Orlando's new Stella Nova Resort is 'out of this world'\nUniversal Stella Nova Resort\nadvertising policyand\nproduct review methodologyfor more information.\nEditor's Note\n- Universal Stella Nova Resort is the first of three new hotels opening at Universal Orlando this year.\n- All three are located near the all-new Universal Epic Universe, which opens in May 2025.\n- Stella Nova has 750 guest rooms and an affordable $147 starting price.\nIt's no secret that 2025 is going to be an \"epic\" year for Universal Orlando Resort. The resort's third park, Universal Epic Universe, is scheduled to open on May 22. But you don't have to wait until then to explore some of the park's other exciting new developments.\nIn addition to Epic Universe, Universal is opening three new hotels and adding 2,000 guest rooms to its portfolio this year. The first of these, Universal Stella Nova Resort, opened on Jan. 21, 2025, and TPG was among the first to stay at this galactically cool property.\nThe hotel's design is inspired by the vast and beautiful wonders of outer space, which you can see reflected throughout the property starting with the exterior. The facade of the hotel is covered by more than 140,000 colorful dichroic tiles that change color based on the lighting and time of day. When I arrived around midday, they were shimmering in an entire rainbow of hues, but in the evening they take on darker blues and purples.\nUpon entering the lobby, you'll see space-themed artwork inspired by NASA photographs. The cosmic aura continues through to the nebulalike purple, blue and white color scheme and the spaceport windows in the guest rooms.\nHere's a first look at Universal Stella Nova Resort, including cost, amenities, dining and theme park perks.\nWhat does it cost to stay at Stella Nova Resort?\nStella Nova Resort is part of Universal's Prime Value lodging category (Universal Aventura Hotel and the soon-to-open Universal Terra Luna Resort also belong to this collection).\nPrices start at $147 per night (plus tax), but this price is only available for stays of four nights or longer. On average, we found pricing to be closer to $200 to $230 per night for a one-night stay. Every room at Stella Nova is a standard two-queen room, so the only price difference you will find is if you choose a pool-view room over a standard view. You'll pay between $10 and $20 more for a pool view.\nThe parking cost for overnight guests is $30 plus tax per vehicle per night.\nStella Nova Resort is bookable via the Capital One Travel portal. Eligible Capital One cardholders can book this resort via Capital One Travel and pay in cash with their Capital One card or redeem Capital One miles. When you pay using your card, you can earn up to 10 miles per dollar spent, depending on the Capital One card you carry.\nAmong the Capital One cards you should consider using if booking this way are:\nCapital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card: Earn 10 miles per dollar on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Capital One Venture X Business: Earn 10 miles per dollar on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card: Earn 5 miles per dollar on hotels, vacation rentals and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card: Earn 5 miles per dollar on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card: Earn 5% cash back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card: Earn 5% cash back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Capital One Spark Cash Plus: Earn 5% cash back on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Capital One Spark Miles for Business: Earn 5 miles per dollar on hotels, vacation rentals and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.\nStella Nova Resort location\nStella Nova, along with Universal's other two upcoming hotels, is located adjacent to Epic Universe. Epic Universe itself is about three miles from the rest of Universal Orlando, but there is a complimentary shuttle service between the new park (and its hotels) and the rest of Universal Orlando Resort. From Stella Nova, it is about a 12-minute bus ride to Universal Orlando's main security area that leads to Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure and CityWalk (bus transfer is available to Volcano Bay water park).\nFrom Orlando International Airport (MCO), it's about a 20-minute drive to Stella Nova Resort. Universal does offer a paid shuttle service called the SuperstarStar Shuttle, but ride-hailing services and rental cars are also readily available.\nInside Stella Nova Resort guest rooms\nAll 750 rooms at Stella Nova Resort are double queen rooms that sleep up to four guests, so the layouts are similar in every guest room, though you can choose from standard-view and pool-view categories. ADA-compliant rooms are available. A standard-view room looks over the back of Epic Universe. You can see portions of the park peeking out, which builds the excitement for your vacation.\nInside the rooms, the color scheme is similar to that of the hotel's public areas, with space-inspired art. A few fun details, like a galactic mural behind the beds, Creamsicle-colored accent pillows and sleek, curved furnishings add to the futuristic feel.\nThe beds are soft and comfortable, with a thin coverlet that isn't necessarily a bad thing when you consider the typical outside temperatures in Orlando. I also appreciated that there was a QR code on the TV that I could scan to use my phone as a remote control (there is a standard remote, as well).\nSimilar to many other Universal Orlando hotels, the bathroom is split-style, with a sink and vanity in the center and a door that separates it from the toilet and tub. This not only allows for privacy but also makes it easier for multiple guests to get ready simultaneously.\nThe specialty Cosmic Ember bath products had a fresh scent, and I loved the continuity of the branding even for the shampoo, conditioner and soap.\nGuest rooms are also equipped with standard amenities like a coffee and tea maker, mini refrigerator, hair dryer and iron. Standard Wi-Fi is complimentary, or you can upgrade to premium Wi-Fi for $9.95 per day.\nStella Nova Resort amenities\nStella Nova offers similar amenities to Universal's other Prime Value properties. It has a resort-style pool complex with a 10,000-square-foot pool, a hot tub, a kid's splash pad and lawn games like hula hoops and table tennis. The resort shows poolside movies on select nights (check at the front desk for a weekly schedule).\nThe hotel also has a 24-hour fitness center, an arcade, laundry facilities, an Avis car rental desk, a ticket desk to assist with theme park planning needs and a gift shop so special (for now, at least) that it is one of the first hotels to feature a large collection of Epic Universe merchandise. I saw shirts, toys and collectibles representing all of the lands coming to the new park and some general Epic Universe-branded merchandise.\nUniversal Creative turned an unused portion of the third floor with no guest rooms into a \"sky bridge\" with starry lights in the ceiling, which is already proving to be a popular spot after being open only a couple of days.\nIf you can't resist getting that perfect Instagram photo in this trippy space, try to do so quietly so as not to disturb the guests staying on this floor.\nStella Nova Resort dining\nStella Nova Resort has several dining options to keep you fueled up for your theme park adventures.\nCosmos Cafe and Market\nLocated in the hotel lobby, Cosmos Cafe and Market is a quick-service outlet that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner daily. It also offers a selection of grab-and-go items like ice cream, snacks, prepackaged salads and sandwiches and coffee drinks.\nThe menu is comprised mostly of American classics like burgers, fries, pizza and pasta, but there are some specialty items as well. I stopped by for lunch during my stay (which was too brief to make time for breakfast).\nI tried the hot honey pizza ($15.50), which was topped with cheese, garlic cream sauce, buffalo chicken and, of course, hot honey. It was tasty — and spicy. I had the Mexican street corn ($7) on the side, which was by far my favorite dish and a huge portion for being a side item. My dining companion had the Stella burger ($15.50), which was a delicious classic burger.\nAll in all, the food was good and filling, but there are so many good dining options inside the park and at CityWalk, I think I would save my Stella Nova meals for when I needed something before heading out for the day or when I was starving after a long day at the parks.\nNova Bar\nNova Bar is also located in the lobby and is open daily from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. In addition to classic beer, wine and cocktails, you'll find space-themed drinks like the Black Hole ($16), which is basically an espresso martini, and the Super Nova (also $16), a whiskey-based cocktail with cherry-infused Campari and tart cherry syrup served smoked over a large ice cube.\nGalaxy Bar and Galaxy Grill\nGalaxy Bar and Galaxy Grill are the hotel's poolside drink and dining options. Starters include things like chips and salsa, hummus and veggies and a Mexican shrimp cocktail. For your meal, you can choose from a selection of salads, burgers, sandwiches and wraps.\nGalaxy Bar has a lengthy beer list with a mix of cans and drafts and a handful of hard ciders and seltzers.\nPizza delivery\nDirect-to-room pizza delivery is also available daily between 5 p.m. and midnight. You can place your order via phone or the [online order form](https://dag-snr.constantcontactsites.com/pizza-delivery-menu).\nStella Nova Resort theme park perks\nLike all Universal Orlando hotels, guests enjoy certain perks that only onsite hotel guests enjoy. These include early access to select theme parks and attractions each morning. Which park(s) and attractions you get access to can vary by day, but you'll get a 30-minute head start at Volcano Bay and a full hour at Islands of Adventure or Universal Studios.\nStella Nova guests also get park-to-hotel package delivery, resort-wide charging privileges using their room key and complimentary shuttle service to and from Universal's theme parks and CityWalk. Even if you drive, I recommend using the shuttle service because Universal does not offer free theme park parking to hotel guests.\nStella Nova (like its sister property, Terra Luna) has a walking path that will lead to Epic Universe when the park opens in May. It's about a 10-minute walk, but you can also take the shuttle if you choose.\nThings I loved about Stella Nova Resort\n- I am a sucker for good theming, so I was all-in on the chic spaceship vibes Stella Nova was giving off. Everything from the futuristic lobby seating to the artwork felt upscale and ultramodern. With theme parks leaning more and more toward immersing guests in the worlds they create, it only makes sense that Universal would extend this sentiment to its hotels.\n- The excitement for Epic Universe's grand opening this year is palpable among theme park fans. Stella Nova offers the first and only way for Universal guests to stay so close to this groundbreaking new park and get a glimpse inside even while they are still putting the finishing touches on the attractions. Aside from adding to the anticipation, once the park does open, guests staying at Stella Nova Resort will be only a short walk or bus ride away from Epic Universe.\n- Especially while everything in the hotel is shiny and new, you cannot beat this resort's level of theming and amenities at such an affordable price point. Universal has hotel rooms that range from the $150 range all the way up to as much as $800 per night. Obviously, you get what you pay for, and Stella Nova appears to be a great value for the nightly rate.\nThings to consider before staying at Stella Nova Resort\n- Though you are a stone's throw from Epic Universe when you stay at Stella Nova, you are a few miles away from the rest of Universal Orlando Resort. If you prefer the convenience of taking a boat, bus or short walk to Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure and CityWalk, that will not be an option when you stay here.\n- Unlike Universal's Signature Collection properties (like the upcoming\n[Universal Helios Grand Hotel](https://thepointsguy.com/news/epic-universe-helios-grand-hotel/)), you won't find amenities like multiple pools, waterslides, formal sit-down dining, 24-hour room service or luggage delivery. If those are luxuries you are acclimated to, you need to consider whether you can do without them at Stella Nova.\nBottom line\nUniversal Stella Nova Resort is the first of three new hotels opening near Epic Universe this year and it sets a high bar. Universal Terra Luna Resort opens on March 25, 2025, and should be similar in all but its theming, while Universal Helios Grand Hotel will become Epic Universe's flagship hotel when it opens along with the new park on May 22, 2025.\nThe reasons for staying at this particular hotel will be obvious once the park opens, but it offers a rare opportunity to be among the first guests on Epic Universe property for those who choose to stay here now even before May. I can confidently say I was not ready to come back down to Earth after my out-of-this-world visit to Universal Stella Nova Resort.\nRelated reading:",
