  "text": "Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe! This chocolate chip cookie recipe is made with only brown sugar and makes cookies that are the perfect blend of soft and chewy!\nThese Chewy Brown Sugar Chocolate Chip Cookies are easy to make!\nThey’re great spur-of-the-moment cookies because there is no need to soften the butter ahead of time. The dough comes together in a matter of minutes, and no chilling is required.\nIf you like a thicker cookie, you can refrigerate it for 30 minutes or so before baking, but no need to chill it if you don’t want to.\nAnd the use of all brown sugar gives these cookies a deeper, richer flavor and makes for chewy cookies. So, the next time a cookie craving strikes, bake up a batch of these cookies!\nWhat makes these cookies chewy?\n- Melted butter: Using melted butter helps the cookies to come together quickly, and it also increases the chewiness.\n- Brown sugar: Using only brown sugar helps to make them chewier.\n- Extra egg yolk: The fat in the yolk helps to increase chewiness.\nIngredient notes and substitutions\n- Butter: I use salted butter in this recipe. If you’re using unsalted butter, increase the salt by 1/4 teaspoon.\n- If you want to brown the butter, you will need to use more butter because browning butter causes it to cook down. Otherwise, you will be left with a drier dough. You could also try my\nbrown butter chocolate chip cookie recipe.\n- If you want to brown the butter, you will need to use more butter because browning butter causes it to cook down. Otherwise, you will be left with a drier dough. You could also try my\n- Brown sugar: Light brown sugar or dark brown sugar will work. Dark brown sugar will give you richer, more toffee-like flavor.\n- This recipe uses only brown sugar, no white sugar, in order to make the cookies chewier.\n- Flour: Correctly measuring the ingredients is key! I suggest weighing the ingredients. If you aren’t going to weigh the flour, then you need to aerate it (sifting or fluffing) and then lightly spoon into the measuring cup and leveling. If you don’t want to sift or weigh the flour, please use less flour. Packing in too much flour will cause the cookies not to spread.\n- Chocolate: You can substitute 4 ounces finely chopped semisweet baking chocolate for chocolate chips. This will give you a flatter cookie that spreads more.\n- Feel free to use a different type of chocolate chip – semisweet chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, dark chocolate chips, or even white chocolate chips will work. Chocolate chunks can also be used.\nHow to make chewy chocolate chip cookies\nHere you’ll find step-by-step photos showing how to make this recipe. The full recipe is given below.\nStep 1: Melt butter in a heavy saucepan. or in a microwave-safe bowl. The butter should be just melted. If you want to brown the butter, please see the note above in “Ingredient notes and substitutions”.\nStep 2: Add brown sugar to a large bowl.\nStep 3: Stir to combine butter and sugar. Let stand 5 minutes.\nStep 4: Add egg and egg yolk; stir to combine. Stir in vanilla extract.\nStep 5: Add flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir in dry ingredients until just combined. Please see the comments about flour in the “Ingredient notes and substitutions” section.\nStep 6: Stir in chocolate chips or chunks.\nStep 7: Using a medium cookie scoop (1.5 tablespoon), drop scoops of dough 2 inches apart on prepared cookie sheet.\nStep 8: Bake for about 7-10 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are golden brown. The centers should still look soft and slightly underbaked. That will help to keep the cookies soft.\nStep 9: Let cool on cookie sheet for 5 minutes. Remove to wire rack to finish cooling.\nRecipe Tips!\n- Mixing: I suggest stirring this recipe together by hand rather than using a hand or stand mixer.\n- Baking: It’s important to slightly underbake the cookies. This will give you a softer, chewier cookie.\n- Oven temperature: If you’d like the cookies to spread more or brown less, decrease the oven temperature by 25F to 350F.\n- Flat cookies: If your cookies are coming out too flat, cover and chill the dough for 30-60 minutes. Also, some people have had better luck using 3 cups of flour (360g).\n- Topping: The cookies are great as-is, but if you like more salty/sweet flavor, sprinkle the cookies with a bit of sea salt or finishing salt.\nRecipe FAQs\nYes! I recommend flash freezing the dough in scoops by placing scoops of the dough onto a baking sheet. Once the dough is frozen through, transfer the frozen balls of cookie dough to a freezer-safe container, and store in the freezer.\nYou can! Bake the cookies as-directed. Let the cookies cool to room temperature on a wire cooling rack. Place the cookies in a freezer-safe container, and freeze.\nStorage\nThe cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature. They will keep for up to 4 days when properly stored.\nMore easy cookie recipes!\nIf you’ve tried this chewy chocolate chip cookie recipe, don’t forget to rate the recipe and leave me a comment below.
