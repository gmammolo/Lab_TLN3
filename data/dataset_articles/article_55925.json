  "text": "Easiest Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe is a one bowl chocolate chip cookie recipe that makes soft chocolate chip cookies in less than 20 minutes- no mixer necessary, no chilling needed.\nI’ve made a lot of chocolate chip cookies. A lot a lot. Probably more cookies than I should say. Sometimes, I break out my mixer and make a recipe like my brownie cookie recipe that needs time to chill.\nOther times, I want cookies five minutes ago. When those cookie cravings hit, I need a simple, easy, go-to cookie that I can whip up in just a few minutes.\nThis Easiest Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe is just such a recipe. The cookies can be made from scratch in less than 20 minutes, and there’s no need to get the mixer out or to chill the dough. All of which make this the simplest chocolate chip cookie recipe.\nThis popular recipe has been shared over 100,000 times and has thousands of glowing reviews. Give it a try, and it may just be your new go-to easy chocolate chip cookie recipe!\n“This was seriously the easiest and most delicious cookie recipe I’ve ever tried! and I’ve tried a lot!!!” – Treasure via Pinterest\nWhat makes this the easiest chocolate chip cookie recipe?\nThis recipe\n- uses just a few basic ingredients like flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt.\n- is so fast and so easy that you can make it in less than 20 minutes – no mixer needed, no chilling required.\n- is a one-bowl recipe so both mixing and cleanup are easier.\nIngredient notes and substitutions\n- Butter: This recipe begins with melted butter. I prefer to use salted butter, but you can use unsalted butter if you prefer.\n- The butter should just barely be melted. That means that it shouldn’t be sizzling hot or browned.\n- If you’re worried about getting it too hot, melt the butter about 90% of the way and then whisk it until it is completely melted.\n- Sugars: This recipe uses both brown sugar and granulated (white sugar). If you would like to use only brown sugar, check out my\nbrown sugar chocolate chip cookie recipe.- Using only granulated sugar will give you crispier cookies.\n- For this recipe, you can use either dark or light brown sugar. Dark brown sugar will give you a slightly richer flavor.\n- I’ve also swapped the amounts of brown sugar and granulated sugar and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of granulated sugar. The cookies are slightly chewier this way.\n- Measuring Flour: If you aren’t weighing your ingredients, I can’t recommend that enough. If you are using measuring cups, be sure to sift or stir the flour before measuring. Flour packs easily and using too much flour in cookies will give you dry, crumbly dough and cookies that don’t spread.\n- Salt: Kosher salt is a larger-grain salt that isn’t as “salty” as table salt. If you’re using table salt, be sure to use 1/4 teaspoon.\n- Please note that the recipe calls for 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt. I’ve seen people who have commented that the cookies were salty, and it turned out that they had used several times the amount of salt that the recipe calls for.\n- Chocolate Chips: I use semisweet chocolate chips. You can use dark, bittersweet, milk, or white chocolate chips. People have used all sorts of mix-ins, like M&Ms or other candy and chip combinations, in this recipe.\nHow to make easy chocolate chip cookies\nThis is a seriously simple recipe with just a few steps. Here are step-by-step photos showing how to make this recipe.\nStep 1: You’re going to start by melting the butter. The butter shouldn’t be sizzling hot. If you’re not sure how hot is too hot, you’ll want it about 90% melted, and then you’ll whisk it until it finishes melting.\nStep 2: Once the butter has melted, whisk in the sugars until well-combined.\nStep 3: Mix in the vanilla extract and the egg.\nStep 4: Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir in just until combined. You don’t want to overmix the dough.\nStep 5: Stir in the chocolate chips, and then scoop the dough. Place about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet.\nStep 6: Bake until the cookies are set on the edges but slightly underdone in the middle, about 7-10 minutes. Slightly under-baking the cookies helps to keep them soft.\nSince oven temperatures can vary, you may find that you need to adjust the baking times.\nRecipe Tips!\nThere are over 1,000 comments and questions on this recipe. I’ve added this section to answer some of the common questions in the hope that it saves people from having to try to sift through all of those comments. If you have a question that isn’t answered below, please feel free to ask!\n- Mixing: I recommend mixing the cookie dough by hand to avoid overmixing the dough. However, you can mix the dough using an electric mixer if you prefer.\n- Gluten Free: I haven’t tried it, but I’ve heard from several people who have used a measure-for-measure gluten-free flour in this recipe, and they’ve said that it worked well. However, I haven’t heard from anyone regarding other flours, such as almond flour.\n- Freezing: You can freeze the baked cookie dough or freeze the cookie dough.\n- Cookies: To freeze the cookies, bake them as-directed, and let them cool to room temperature on a wire cooling rack. Once the cookies have cooled, place them in a freezer-safe container and freeze for up to 1 month.\n- Cookie dough: To freeze the cookie dough, scoop up the cooking dough and place on a rimmed baking sheet. Flash freeze until the dough is frozen through. Once the scoops are frozen through, place the frozen scoops in a freezer-safe container and freeze for up to 1 month.\nHow to make soft chocolate chip cookies\nThe best way to make soft chocolate chip cookies is to slightly under-bake the cookies. In order to slightly under-bake the cookies, the edges should look set (but not brown).\nThe center of the cookies should look soft and even a little puffy still. This trick will help to keep your cookies nice and soft.\nStorage\nStore any leftover cookies in an airtight container at room temperature. The cookies are best eaten within 3 days.\nMore chocolate chip cookie recipes!\nIf you’ve tried this easiest chocolate chip cookie recipe, don’t forget to rate the recipe and leave me a comment below.

Butter should be completely melted but shouldn’t be hot.\n- In a large bowl, mix butter with the sugars until well-combined.\n- Stir in vanilla and egg until incorporated.\n- Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Please read the recipe note about properly measuring flour.\n- Mix dough until just combined. Dough should be soft and a little sticky but not overly sticky.\n- Stir in chocolate chips.\n- Scoop out 1.5 tablespoons of dough (medium cookie scoop) and place 2 inches apart on baking sheet.\n- Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until cookies are set. They will be puffy and still look a little underbaked in the middle.3\nVideo\nNotes\n- Flour: Be sure to fluff and then scoop and sweep to measure the flour. Too much flour will result in a dry or crumbly cookie. For the ingredient measurements by weight, please click “metric” directly underneath the ingredients.\n- Salt: Or 1/4 teaspoon table salt.\n- Baking: Don’t over-bake the cookies, or you won’t end up with soft cookies. Several people have said that they’ve needed to bake the cookies for longer. Since oven temps can vary, I suggest starting with the listed baking time and increasing the time as needed.\n- If you’re interested in the chocolate version of these cookies, you can find that recipe\nhere. - Nutrition facts are estimates.\nNutrition\nDid You Make This Recipe?\nShare it with me on Instagram @i_heart_eating and follow on Youtube @katedean and Pinterest @katedean for more!\nOriginally published 8/16/16.
