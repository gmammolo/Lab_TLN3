  "text": "Make your own homemade freezer lasagna with this delicious recipe! This recipe makes perfect freezer meals and can easily be doubled or tripled.\nFreezer meals are a great way to get ahead! This freezer lasagna recipe is easy to scale, so you can easily stock your freezer with homemade make-ahead meals.\nLasagna is great for busy days, makes a perfect meal for new parents or parents-to-be, and can easily be baked on an I-don’t-feel-like-cooking day.\nIngredients and substitutions\n- Ground beef: I use either 85% or 90% lean ground beef. Ground Italian sausage also works well in this recipe.\n- White or yellow onion\n- Garlic cloves\n- Salt\n- Pepper\n- Heavy cream\n- Crushed tomatoes\n- Diced tomatoes\n- Italian seasoning\n- Dried sweet basil\n- Whole-milk ricotta cheese: The extra fat in the whole-milk ricotta helps keep it less grainy than part-skim once frozen.\n- Parmesan cheese\n- Large eggs\n- No-boil lasagna noodles\n- Mozzarella cheese: The lasagna is pretty cheesy. Feel free to decrease the amount of cheese if you prefer.\nWhat makes this lasagna recipe different?\nThis lasagna recipe was specifically made for the freezer. The lasagna is put together and then frozen uncooked.\nHow to make freezer lasagna\nBrown ground beef in Dutch oven. Drain, and set aside.\nAdd onion to the now-empty Dutch oven and cook until softened, about 2 minutes.\nAdd garlic, salt, and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\nAdd cream and simmer until liquid evaporates and only fat remains, about 4 minutes.\nStir in cooked meat, crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, and seasonings. Bring to simmer.\nReduce heat to low and simmer until flavors blend, about 3 minutes.\nRemove pot from heat, cool sauce for 20 minutes, then refrigerate until cool, at least 20 minutes.\nMix ricotta, 1 cup Parmesan, eggs, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.\nSpread ¼ cup meat sauce over bottom of 9- x 13-inch baking dish.\nPlace 3 noodles crosswise on top of sauce.\nEvenly space 9 tablespoons ricotta mixture over noodles, and sprinkle evenly with 1¼ cups mozzarella.\nSpoon 1½ cups sauce over cheese.\nRepeat layering of noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella and sauce two more times.\nPlace 3 remaining noodles on top and spread with remaining sauce. Cover with remaining 1¼ cups mozzarella and remaining ¼ cup Parmesan.\nWrap with plastic wrap, and cover tightly with a layer of foil.\nFreeze.\nWhen ready to serve, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375F.\nRemove plastic wrap, and re-cover lasagna with foil.\nBake 1 hour and 15 minutes, then remove foil. Continue baking until cheese is spotty brown and sauce is bubbling, about 30 minutes.\nLet lasagna stand for 15 minutes before serving.\nTips\nI’ve lost count of how many times I’ve made this recipe over the years. Here are some tips to help you make a great frozen lasagna.\n- Be sure to let the lasagna cool to room temperature before wrapping in plastic wrap. Otherwise, the plastic wrap can stick to the lasagna.\n- When I’m making freezer meals, I write the name of the dish, the date it was made, and any directions I need to finish it on the aluminum foil.\n- I usually triple the recipe when I make it. It only takes a few more minutes, and then I have one lasagna a month in the freezer for the next three months.\n- If freezing in aluminum pans, the pans will stack well. However, let the lasagnas freeze through before stacking. Otherwise, the weight of the pans will push the contents of the bottom pan out, and you’ll end up with a big mess.\nHow to thaw\nI let the frozen lasagna thaw in the fridge for a day or two before I bake it.\nHow long will this keep?\nI use the frozen lasagnas within 3 months.\nServing suggestions\nThis lasagna goes well with my homemade 30 minute garlic knots or garlic breadsticks and a green salad to round out the meal.\nMore freezer-friendly recipes!\nIf you’ve tried this freezer lasagna recipe, don’t forget to rate the recipe and leave me a comment below.
