  "text": "Homemade peanut brittle recipe makes tasty peanut brittle in no time! This classic recipe uses a few pantry-staple ingredients to make peanut brittle in less than 30 minutes.\nThis peanut brittle recipe is a family-favorite. It’s my grandma’s recipe, and she always made batches of it around the holidays.\nThe recipe is really easy; it takes less than 30 minutes to make.\nIt’s also made with just a few pantry-staple ingredients. So the recipe is just as quick and easy as it is tasty!\nHow to make peanut brittle\nStep 1: Line an 18×13-inch pan (half sheet pan) with parchment paper. Set aside.\nStep 2: Gather and measure out the peanuts, butter, baking soda, and vanilla. Set aside.\nStep 3: Add sugar and water to a large saucepan. Stir until well-combined.\nStep 4: Mix in corn syrup until combined. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture begins to boil.\nStep 5: Once it comes to a boil, attach a candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan. The thermometer should not touch the bottom of the pan but should be submerged in the corn syrup mixture.\nStep 6: Cook, stirring regularly, until the temperature of the mixture reaches 235°F.\nStep 7: Stir in the peanuts.\nStep 8: Continue to constantly stir until the temperature of the mixture reaches 300°F. The mixture should be amber colored and should smell nutty.\nStep 9: As soon as it reaches 300°F, remove from heat and stir in the butter, baking soda, and vanilla. It will foam up quite a bit once the baking soda is added.\nStep 10: Carefully pour peanut brittle mixture out onto the prepared pan. Quickly and carefully spread the mixture out into an even layer in the pan.\nStep 11: Let the mixture cool completely. Break it into pieces, and enjoy!\nTips\n- The baking soda makes the brittle foam and helps to give the peanut brittle its light texture.\n- It’s crucial to use a candy thermometer. You’ll need the candy thermometer to watch the temperature so that you can add the peanuts at the right time and cook the mixture to the correct stage.\n- The peanut brittle mixture will be very hot and very sticky. Please be very careful not to get it on yourself as you pour it into the pan and spread it out.\nRecipe FAQs\nYou can! Store the peanut brittle in a freezer-safe container and freeze. It will keep for up to 3 months in the freezer.\nYes, you can use a different type of nut, like almonds or cashews.\nThe salt helps to balance out the sweetness of the brittle. Feel free to use lightly salted nuts, but I don’t recommend using unsalted nuts.\nStorage\nPeanut brittle should be stored in an airtight container at room temperature. It will keep for several weeks, up to about 6 weeks, when properly stored.\nMore Christmas treat recipes!\nIf you’ve tried this homemade peanut brittle recipe, don’t forget to rate the recipe and leave me a comment below.
