  "text": "City Editor Haley hobbing in here — I asked our fellow readers earlier this month if they wanted to join me in finding a new hobby or club. Now, with the help of their suggestions + the top creative hobbies to enjoy in 2025, we’re crafting a guide of our own.\nOutdoors + preservation\nChattanooga Bluebird Society\nLooking to help the bluebirds of Chattanooga? As suggested by Diane S., president of the group, this club is volunteer-driven + works to build birdhouses and install them around our local parks and schools for free. The next membership meeting is Sunday, Feb. 2, and fees are $20 per year.\nChattanooga Area Historical Association\nThis organization has been chartered since 1948 with the goal to preserve the history of Chattanooga + the 50-mile radius surrounding us. Memberships are open to the public and start at $25 per year.\nDIY home decor\nWoodcraft of Chattanooga\nReader Louise S. asked if there were any local apprenticeships or classes to learn how to flip furniture and use power tools. Keep an eye out for upcoming classes from this spot on Brainerd Road — from woodworking fundamentals to power carving + wood burning.\nMusic\nMidsouth Symphonic Band\nSuggested by reader Megan H., this community-driven ensemble is comprised of professional musicians, retirees, students + teachers and has been creating music together since 1990. Membership is $50 per year and no audition is required.\nDance + movement arts\nChattanooga Vintage Dancers\nTwo-step back in time with this social dancing club that will teach you the basics of dance styles through the ages — think: the foxtrot, tango + rumba. Workshops start at $5 + you can learn more than just dancing by signing up for one of the discussions of fashion and hairstyles of the past.\nSustainable fashion design\nChattanooga Fiber Arts Guild\nWhether you already have the gift of fiber arts or you’ve been eyeing granny squares you’ve always wanted to try, members + non-members are welcome to join this group’s programming.\nThe Knot and Needle\nThis Red Bank studio has a wide array of classes for beginners and experienced makers alike. Sign up for workshops like a sewing machine introduction or even knitting for the kiddos.\nCreative writing + storytelling\nWalnut Street Publishing\nEvery third Thursday, you can join this local publishing company for its Definitely Not Therapy monthly mental wellness for creatives workshop. During this free meet up, you’ll be able to reflect + get coached on how to get reconnected with your work.\nBonus: Not sure what activity would best fit you? The Chattery is known to have a little bit of everything to get you started.",
