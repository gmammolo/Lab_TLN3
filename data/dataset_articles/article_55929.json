  "text": "Inside the David Lynch Shrine at Bob's Big Boy Chris Nichols Thu, January 23, 2025 at 8:13 PM UTC 4 min read\nArchivist Kat Fox documents the David Lynch Shrine at Bob's Big BoyPhoto by Irvin Rivera Shortly after the family of filmmaker David Lynch announced his death last Thursday morning, fans began gathering at Bob’s Big Boy in Burbank. Hundreds of them left something behind as a huge shrine to the visionary behind Blue Velvet and Mulholand Drive took shape at the feet of the Big Boy statue on Riverside Drive.\nThe David Lynch Shrine at Bob's Big BoyPhoto by Irvin Rivera As the tributes continued to pour in, the installation was being disassembled Wednesday afternoon by archivist and historian Kat Fox, who wrote her UCLA thesis on roadside shrines and spontaneous memorializations. Fox has previously studied temporary monuments to people lost from COVID, AIDS and 9/11. “Lynch doesn’t have a star on the Walk of Fame which is where these often crop up,” Fox said. “I’m very interested in the way L.A. chooses to memorialize and the way the community comes together in a place like Bob’s that has larger connections to the movie and TV industry,” she said. “It’s a cultural cornerstone and part of David Lynch lore.”\nThe David Lynch Shrine at Bob's Big BoyPhoto by Irvin Rivera\nBob's Big Boy in BurbankPhoto by Chris Nichols The landmark restaurant was a longtime favorite of the acclaimed director, who had a fondness for the lost world of 1950s Americana, and where he wrote and found inspiration. “I went there every day for seven years,” the director remarked after a film screening. “I would write on the napkins. It was like having a desk. You need paper and there’s a piece of paper and you write on it when you get ideas.”\nThe David Lynch Shrine at Bob's Big BoyPhoto by Irvin Rivera Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The black coffee, cigarettes and damn fine cherry pie were spilling onto the sidewalk when Rory MacDonald of Bob’s got the call from Fox seeking to preserve the contents. “I’ve seen public memorials before but nothing like this,” MacDonald said. “They’re usually put up by family. This feels like family where everybody comes together. It’s the power of community.”\nThe David Lynch Shrine at Bob's Big BoyPhoto by Irvin Rivera Original drawings and paintings, poetry, and personal letters were mixed in with stuffed logs, real logs , donuts, Cheetos and keys to the hotel where special agent Dale Cooper stayed in Twin Peaks . “There’s half-drunk coffee and half-smoked cigarettes,” Fox said. “It’s like they’re sharing it with him.” An estimated 400 cigarettes, 45 cups of coffee, and dozens of donuts and pie slices were accessioned, documented and photographed before finding their way to the Dumpster.\nThe David Lynch Shrine at Bob's Big BoyPhoto by Irvin Rivera The restaurant noted a 30% bump in sales over the last week and customers milled around outside waiting to be called for a table. Comedian Dana Gould , who added a contribution to the shrine, echoed the feeling of loss from fans gathered around the statue. “He died and took half the town with him,” Gould lamented. “The last weekend of the Biden presidency, the fires and David Lynch left the earth. I’m here doing what Lynch did. I’m sitting and writing because I don’t want to go home.”\nThe David Lynch Shrine at Bob's Big BoyPhoto by Irvin Rivera MacDonald has added photos and quotes from the filmmaker to video screens inside the restaurant and plans to display a few items from the memorial in a permanent shadowbox. “So fans can see the walls he used to see,” he says. “And drink the shake he used to drink.”\nArchivist Kat Fox boxing up the David Lynch shrinePhoto by Irvin Rivera Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement What will happen to the carefully packed boxes of art and artifacts? “I’m hoping to find a permanent and appropriate place,” Fox says. “Whether that’s Lynch-dedicated holdings or other special collections. I don’t have the ideal place in mind but there are so many film and TV archives in L.A.” As the work was wrapping up after dark, actors Eric Edelstein , George Griffith and Rebekah Del Rio , who all appeared in the 2017 Twin Peaks as well as Lynch’s longtime producer Sabrina Sutherland met up for dinner after stopping by the statue and meeting Fox.\nActor Eric Edelstein at the David Lynch shrinePhoto by Chris Nichols Earlier in the week, a community of Lynch lovers gathered at Dynasty Typewriter for a tribute hosted by Edelstein. They raised money for wildfire victims including fellow Twin Peaks alumni Carel Struycken who lost his home in Altadena . “When you’re weird,” Gould said. “You don’t want to feel alone.”\nRory MacDonald of Bob's helps clean up Photo by Chris Nichols Advertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 29,097 people played the daily Crossword recently.
