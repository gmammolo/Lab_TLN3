  "text": "Sauna and Cold Plunge Benefits + My Must Have Sauna Accessories\nEvery time I post anything about hot/cold therapy on my IG, you guys wanna know all the info. I feel like saunas and cold plunging are kind of all the rage right now? Guess everyone is really experiencing the health benefits. Michael, Westin and I do too. We’ll go over the benefits of saunas in a minute, but like, the high that I personally get from it is EUPHORIC.\nYears ago, it all started with some cold showers. And before that I was such a fan of ice facials, cryotherapy, and duh, ice rolling. Big ice lover over here.\nBefore we get into all the specifics about the brands, and what I like about my sauna and cold plunge routine, the benefits, (& accessories I love, LOL) here is the exact protocol that I’ve been doing.\nMY HOT/COLD THERAPY PROTOCOL:\n+ 2 mins ice bath\n+ 15 mins sauna\n+ 2.5 mins ice bath\n+ 20 min sauna\n+ 3 mins ice bath\nAnd I do this 3-4 times a week. It’s addicting. The feeling in your body after a cold plunge is insane. There’s no other feeling like it. It improves physical and mental health and is a huge stress reliever! The key is not to overdo it or it’s not as effective. Around 11 minutes per week is all that’s needed.\nDr. Huberman says that you should try to finish on COLD. And like, DUH, you’re gonna to want to end with the sauna, we all do. But if you end with cold it allows your body to heat up naturally which will stimulate your metabolism. And you want to keep that freezing fucking cold, shivering feeling for as long as possible so I wait like 30 minutes to shower. You want to keep that shiver effect so that it gets to your brown fat.\nThe postpartum experience with Townes was so different from Zaza’s, in so many ways, but one of the main things is that I feel like this layer of fat has dissolved from my body – & it’s from hot & cold therapy. I swear.\nSidenote:\nIf you have yet to meet Dr. Huberman, he is a neuroscientist and tenured professor in the department of neurobiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine. He has made numerous significant contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function, and neuroplasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to rewire and learn new behavior skills and cognitive functioning.\nHe has a phenomenal podcast called Huberman Lab that me and Michael are both regular listeners of. Highly recommended because he does the best job presenting information that’s science-backed, digestible, applicable to literally everyone. He has been on The Skinny Confidential HIM & HER show, part 1 & part 2, and like I took so many notes. Seriously listen with pen & paper.\nOk, so let’s get into the exact types of saunas & ice baths Michael and I have in our home.\nBARREL SAUNA\nIn our backyard we have such a beautiful, classic barrel sauna. It’s so relaxing, but energizing at the same time when used with the ice bath. This one makes you sweat. It’s hot, it gets touch, but the benefits are beyond.\nIf you’re interested in the sauna that we have, use this link or email hilary@theskinnyconfidential.com and she’ll send you some info.\nSUN HOME INFRARED SAUNA\nIn my office, I have a Sun Home infrared sauna. I LOVE IT. For me, I go in this for more of a chill time. It’s not as hot as the barrel, it’s more of like a slow burn. Michael likes to read in it, I go in the morning after I drink too much, or do legs up the wall and meditate. It’s just not as intense as the barrel but you still get insane benfits. You can use this link for $300 off a sauna or cold plunge with Sun Home.\nHOT TIP: it’s the perfect place to get away from your kids.\nAll The Sauna Benefits:\n+ detoxification\n+ heart health\n+ muscle recovery\n+ anti-aging\n+ relaxation\n+ immunity\n+ sleep\n+ weight loss\n+ lowers blood pressure\n+ increasing blood flow\nIf you decide to go with one of these, be sure to use the code SKINNY on this pricing form, and mention it to your sales rep.\nAlso, if you’re wanting to try an infrared sauna sessions but don’t want to spend all that money installing one in your home or don’t have one at a spa near you, give Higher Dose a try. It enhances relaxation, promotes glowing skin and is perfect for people who don’t have space for a full blown sauna. And you can use code SKINNY15 for 15% off your purchase.\nTHE COLD PLUNGE\nLOVE the cold plunge. It’s so chic & looks good in any home, no matter your style. It’s not an ugly eyesore, ya know? Actually, the founder was on the blog not too long ago and you can check out his interview here. We have ours outside, but this is perfect if you want an ice bath inside your house.\nIf you’re going to purchase from The Cold Plunge use code SKINNY150 for $150 off.\nBLUE CUBE ICE BATH\nThis is the one that we use outside. The weather has been incredible in Austin lately, so we tend to use this one the most. Also, our barrel sauna is really close to it which makes the whole contrast therapy seamless. You can get all different sizes of ice bath from Blue Cube and I highly recommend it. Plus, you can use code SKINNY for $500 off.\nIt’s so nice & grounding and beautifully designed. It kinda like, just blends in with nature. It fits so well with our backyard environment, and Joe Rogan has this one. Fun fact, they were just custom building his when they dropped of mine.\nThe reason we have two, Blue Cube and The Cold Plunge, is because we love to try out all things wellness. Both are great choices and you can’t go wrong with either.\nICE BARREL\nThe Ice Barrel is a really good option if you’re low on space. It’s fairly lightweight and you could put it anywhere. Just to be clear, we do not own this one, but I really like it as an option for people who are maybe renting/planning to move soon, or who are just getting into hot/cold therapy. Again, you can use code SKINNY for $125 off. Arctic Fox is a new portable way to cold plunge that I highly recommend too.\nAll The Ice Bath Health Benefits:\n+ Speeds up muscle & injury recovery\n+ Reduces inflammation\n+ improves fat burning\n+ improves skin conditions\n+ builds mental toughness\n+ Supports a healthy immune system\n+ Enhances immune function\n+ Improves lymphatic circulation\n+ Increases red blood cell count & growth hormone levels\n+ Improves levels of endurance & recovery\n+ Increases cardiovascular health\n+ Increases white blood cells which stimulates the immune system\n+ Improves sleep & reducing stress\n+ Improves circulation\n+ Constricting blood vessels promotes better circulation\nAnd now for the best part. Let’s get into the fashion of it all. LOL. No but really, these are all my must haves:\nMUST HAVE SAUNA ACCESSORIES:\nDuh, to keep it steamy.\nThey regulate the temperature of your head, ears, and even prevent damage to your hair. In a nutshell, your head heats up the fastest and the hats keep your head relatively ‘cool.’ You soak the hat in water first and wear it wet, and as the water evaporates in the sauna, it keeps you cool (ish). Apparently it’s thought to reduce hair loss too.\nI like to fill mine with Beauty Water. It’ll replenish your electrolytes and give you other health and beauty benefits with colostrum and pearl powder too. Learn more [here](https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/beauty-water-an-efficient-solution-to-your-morning-supplements/).\nBecause you still want to be comfortable while getting uncomfortable.\n[Brooke from The Road](https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/what-is-facial-acupuncture/) told me to be careful with my face overheating and that ice rolling while in the sauna will help with hyperpigmentation.\nWe love sipping these in the sauna. Use code SKINNY for 25% off and listen to the founder on the podcast [here](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-skinny-confidential-him-her-podcast/id1093028505?i=1000551748559).\nMUST HAVE COLD PLUNGE ACCESSORIES:\nAlways be protecting your skin from the sun, even in a freezing cold bath.\nLove these pool towels, highly recommend.\n+ [bamboo bathmat](https://amzn.to/3QRCZi0) (more [here](https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/the-wooden-bathmat-of-your-dreams-say-goodbye-to-crusty-rugs/))\nVery grounding & just ties everything together, don’t you think?\nThere you have it. Truly loving all hot/cold therapy things. I love the intenseness of it all and I’ve always been like that with all things. I like super hot, ice fucking cold, insane spice, rough dry brushing – you get it. If you have extra space in your home, you might as well look into getting an indoor sauna.\nOverall, doing alternating between hot and cold temperatures, contrast therapy, made me feel more clarity, more energized and more relaxed, it’s enhanced my quality of sleep & mood and I feel like it’s been really good for my skin like it aids in muscle recovery. Noticed a huge difference in my hormones postpartum too. I felt more even-keeled.\nIf you’re just getting started the move is to ease into it. It’s like you need to have this perfect balance of being uncomfortable but safe. Start slow, with short intervals and work your way up. If you ever feel dizzy or lightheaded in the sauna, get out, stay hydrated and decrease your time.\nYou can literally learn everything else you want to now in Dr. Huberman’s podcast episodes ([part 1](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-skinny-confidential-him-her-podcast/id1093028505?i=1000559313117) & [part 2](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-skinny-confidential-him-her-podcast/id1093028505?i=1000559682914)) and you can [check out this post](https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/dr-andrew-hubermans-ice-bath-tips-tricks/) where we broke down his ice bath tips & tricks & how to utilize ice baths.\nLet me know what benefits you’ve seen from hot and [cold therapy](https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/ice-bath-benefits-you-need-to-know-about/) below. So curious. And if you’re new to all this, just start with a 3 minute ice cold shower & the [ice roller](https://shopskinnyconfidential.com/products/hot-mess-ice-roller). You’ll be addicted in no time.\nx, Lauryn\n+ [BEAUTY WATER](https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/beauty-water-an-efficient-solution-to-your-morning-supplements/): How I start every single day.\n++ My [immune-support toolkit](https://www.theskinnyconfidential.com/lauryns-immune-system-toolkit/).",
