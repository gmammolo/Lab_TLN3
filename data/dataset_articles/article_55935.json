  "text": "Lauren Alaina opened up about her pregnancy when she caught up with Kelly Clarkson on a new episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show on Thursday (January 23).\nAlaina’s appearance on the talk show takes place one day after her surprise pregnancy announcement . The Georgia-born country star debuted her growing baby bump for the first time as she released her newest single, “Those Kind Of Women,” and its heartfelt music video on Wednesday (January 22). The video ends with a dedication to “my Momma and our sweet Baby Arnold coming summer 2025.”\nAlaina, who married husband Cam Arnold in February 2024, said she’s “22 weeks (along)…which is a long time to hide a pregnancy, by the way. I’m very excited for people to know about this.\n“The song is called ‘ Those Kind Of Women ,’ and it’s all about the women who raised me,” Alaina said later when Clarkson asked about the sweet song and the surprise pregnancy announcement in the music video. “And this song means so much to me already, and then I recorded the song and mastered the song, and when I was getting the master back, I had found out that I was pregnant and no one knew except me and my husband. And I’m sobbing listening to the song. And I will say, my mom and I have always been very close, but it has changed. Oh my goodness, I’m so pregnant, I’m gonna cry about it,” Alaina paused as she began to feel emotional. “It’s the best thing I’ve ever done.”\nAlaina is one of several country artists expecting a baby in 2025, along with a few other first-time parents. Most recently, Shay Mooney of Dan + Shay welcomed Baby No. 4 with wife Hannah Mooney . Days earlier, rising country star Sarahbeth Taite announced Baby No. 2’s arrival . Other artists welcoming a baby into the family this year include HARDY , Elle King , Sam Hunt and more. See the pregnancy announcements here .",
