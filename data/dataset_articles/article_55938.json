  "text": "The Atlanta Braves have finally made their move.\nIt had been a quiet winter for the Braves through mid-January, as most of the roster changes were subtractions rather than additions. Among others, Max Fried, Jorge Soler, Travis d'Arnaud, Charlie Morton, and A.J. Minter all walked out the door.\nWith the calendar creeping toward Spring Training, the Braves had two main areas to improve: the starting rotation and the outfield. 2023 National League Most Valuable Player Ronald Acuña Jr. is still recovering from his torn ACL, leaving both corner outfield positions in flux.\nOn Thursday, the Braves addressed one of those needs--in a big way.\nAtlanta has reportedly agreed to a free-agent contract with Jurickson Profar, a 2024 All-Star left fielder with the San Diego Padres. At the time of publication, the length and value of the contract are not yet known.\nESPN's Jeff Passan was the first to report the signing on social media.\nProfar, 31, was once a superstar in the prospect world, but it took him 11 seasons in Major League Baseball to become an All-Star. But he was the heart and soul of the Padres in 2024, racking up a .280/.380/.459 slash line and 3.6 bWAR.\nAdding Profar does wonders for the Braves' outfield situation, which looked fairly bleak in the absence of Acuña. With Michael Harris as the everyday center fielder, Jarred Kelenic and Bryan De La Cruz were slated for starting jobs until Acuña's return.\nNow, Profar slots in perfectly as the left fielder, Kelenic and De La Cruz can platoon for now, and Acuña will give the Braves one of baseball's best outfields once more if he comes back looking like his usual self.\nMore MLB: Mets 'could potentially find' Pete Alonso replacement in 24-year-old Japanese star",
