  "text": "Sister Wives star Janelle Brown shared an update about her 156-acre Taeda Farm, which has become her passion project after she moved to North Carolina.\n“Clearing the Way for Taeda Farm. In our small town, word of mouth is gold — and that’s how we found Earl Brock, with Brock’s lot development,” the company, which is run by Janelle, 55, and her daughter Maddie Brush (née Brown), wrote via its Instagram account alongside clips that showed off the land. “He is the skid steer whisperer and a storyteller extraordinaire. Imagine Barry Corbin with a Southern drawl, a tractor and enough stories to keep you entertained for days.”\nThe duo continued to praise the work Earl had done in the caption, as the video showed him clearing paths on the property. “Earl rolled onto our land with a big grin and left us with clear space for a garden, chicken coop and our future home. (Not to mention some very happy kids who think watching trees turn to mulch is the greatest show on Earth),” they continued.\n“He didn’t just clear the land—he gave us an afternoon of laughter, knowledge and the kind of community connection that makes small-town life so special,” the caption concluded. “Here’s to Earl, his skid steer, and the first big step in building our dream on Taeda Farm — one mulched tree at a time.”\nSister Wives' Janelle and Madison Brown Announce New Flower Business Shortly after the post was shared, several fans took to the comments section to congratulate Janelle and Maddie, 29, on breaking ground on the business.\n“How exciting! Congrats! I hope you find a way to balance the farm and production with the natural area, wildlife and environment we’ve been blessed with. It’s always a juggling act, but you can do it!” one person commented. Another added, “Oh wow! So excited for you and your family! Maybe get a few goats.”\nSister Wives' Janelle Brown Wants to Sell Coyote Pass Land After Kody Split Janelle, Maddie and Maddie’s husband, Caleb Brush , first announced that they founded the company in September 2024. Taeda Farms is a “flower farm in the works” and is considered “halfway homesteading,” according to the company’s Instagram bio.\nShe revealed her latest career venture nearly two years after she announced her split from ex-husband Kody Brown in December 2022. The former couple share six kids, including Maddie and their late son, Robert Garrison Brown, who passed away at the age of 25 in March 2024.\nFollowing their split, Janelle stayed in Flagstaff, Arizona. However, In Touch exclusively revealed that she purchased a property in Chocowinity, North Carolina , for $289,000 in March 2024, and it was listed as agricultural for the company Taeda Farms, LLC.\nThe town is located less than 30 minutes away from where Maddie and Caleb, 37, live with their three kids. Not only did the move allow Janelle to spend more time with Maddie and her grandchildren, but she will also be nearby when Maddie gives birth to baby No. 4.\nCrosswords Celebrity Crossword 126 Play now Janelle has clearly invested a lot of time and energy into Taeda Farms, and she previously shared an update about her living arrangements in a December 2024 social media post.\n“Not West Virginia but my new home,” she wrote alongside a video – which was set to John Denver’s song “Take Me Home, Country Roads” – that captured trees and unpaved roads on a vacant plot of land.",
