And in Pendleton, locals will tell you theirs is Hal's Hamburgers.They made their first burger in 1952 and they've been sizzling ever since. For more than 70 years, Hal's has been at its location on Pendleton's SE Court Street, serving traditional drive-up food with a side of nostalgia.If you close your eyes, you can almost imagine the Fonz and Richie Cunningham munching on some fries here.\"Predominantly hamburgers. We have chicken, like fried chicken, crispy chicken, grilled chicken, salads, sandwiches, anything,\" said Cindy Spiess, owner of Hal's Hamburgers.RELATED: Oregon Grain Growers Brand Distillery in Pendleton offers farm-to-table spiritsRELATED: Phodery in Phoenix brings a food truck lot feel, but with so much moreThat kind of thing is sometimes exactly what we crave. But don’t call Hal’s Hamburgers fast food.\"But we get to have a good conversation with them while they're here waiting for their food, because everything's made to order. So it's not Taco Time. Not to throw other people under the bus, but it's not a fast food restaurant. So we have a little bit of time with the customers, and I think they enjoy that. When they leave, they feel good,\" Spiess explained. \"They like their food and they've had a fun conversation with the staff.\"When Hal's opened in 1952, Court Street was a narrow little roadway. As the town and the road have grown, the restaurant now sits closer to the roadway. In fact, it looks much like it did back in the day because the city of Pendleton says if they modify any part of the building, they have to move the entire restaurant back. That’s no easy feat. So it remains as is.\"The restaurant itself, as you can see, is super small,\" Spiess said. \"A little tiny lobby for like six people to sit down.\"RELATED: This is the go-to place for breakfast in Ashland, OregonRELATED: Grateful Bread in Pacific City combines breakfast, baked goods and a Deadhead vibeI remember coming by as a kid with my grandparents. We’d stop, and we’d get an ice cream or a milkshake. And Hal's is really known for the milkshake.\"Oh, yes. We had a gentleman come through last week, and he traveled the whole world. He said, ‘I’ve been through Europe and Malaysia, everywhere around the world.’ He said, ‘These are the best milkshakes we’ve ever had.’ And I thought, ‘Wow, that’s saying something, right?’” Spiess said.The milkshakes: 52 flavors to choose from, or you can make your own combo.\"And then you can combine flavors. You can get two flavors together or three flavors together. And then we have a quart-sized shake, which always surprises me. Somebody will get like a monster burger and a quart-sized shake. And I’m thinking, ‘Oh my gosh, that shake would fill you up for like two days,’” Spiess said.What’s the top-selling item?\"Probably just the bacon cheeseburger and Huckleberry Shake,\" said Spiess.Hal’s Hamburgers is open daily, closed only on Thanksgiving and Christmas. The next time you find yourself driving through Pendleton, swing by Hal’s Hamburgers. It’s right where it has been for more than 70 years.
