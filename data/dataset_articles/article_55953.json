  "text": "Hershey and the footwear company, Groud Up, have partnered to develop a unique product line that features Hershey-themed footwear as well as snacks.\nSpring 2026 will see the release of Hershey-themed footwear designs in addition to confectionery, such as Hershey's Kisses chocolate, Reese's chocolate, Twizzlers candy, and Jolly Rancher candy.\nAccording to the partners, the designs will have interactive elements while maintaining the core color scheme of the popular chocolate brand.\nA statement from the firm claimed that Ground Up and Hershey's are working together to spread goodwill by giving fans happy experiences.\nFans can expect creative designs and experiences that combine their favorite candies with fashionable, eye-catching footwear.\nMichele Buck, president, chairman, and the current CEO of Hershey's, will retire on June 26. The chocolate giant stated earlier this month that it will look for a new CEO.\nAbout Hershey's\nThe Hershey Company is an American food product firm that specializes in chocolate and confections made with sugar. Perhaps the most well-known American candy bar of the 20th century was Hershey's Milk Chocolate, with its brown and silver packaging. Hershey, Pennsylvania, is home to the company's headquarters.\nMilton S. Hershey established the Lancaster Caramel Company in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in the 1880s, which is where the Hershey Company got its start.\nDue to its success, the company began construction on a second fasility in Derry Township, Pennsylvania, in 1903. Eventually, it grew to become the biggest chocolate production facility in the world.\nHershey, an unincorporated town, sprung up around the plant. After being formed in 1908, the Hershey Chocolate Co. underwent a reorganization in 1927 to become the publicly traded Hershey Chocolate Corporation.\nIn 2005, they changed their name to Hershey Company. With the purchase of Amplify Snack Brands, the company that makes SkinnyPop popcorn, the brand once more ventured outside of confectionery in 2018.\nAs a brand subsidiary, the company bought off other healthy food businesses, such as the company that makes baked puffs called Pirate's Booty.\nSour Strips, a rapidly expanding sour candy brand with a strong social media following, was acquired by the chocolate brand in November 2024. The acquisition signaled their ongoing foray into non-chocolate confections.\nAbout Ground Up\nGround Up's brand aims to create footwear that connects with consumers' interests and preferences. The company integrates popular fandoms into its designs to appeal to diverse consumer identities. The company focuses on innovation and collaborates with established brands to enhance its product offerings.\nGround Up has steadily grown to become a household name by focusing on fun and fashion-forward designs. Ground Up develops fashion trends and products for a wide range of market segments and price points through its portfolio of owned and licensed brand footwear.\nYour perspective matters!\nStart the conversation",
