  "text": "HX Expeditions is launching what it calls the industry's first flight-inclusive cruises from New York to Greenland, with allocated space on United's nonstop flights to Greenland's new international airport in Nuuk.\nHX, the brand formerly known as Hurtigruten Expeditions, will launch the trips from Newark Airport on June 21. The itineraries include flight allocations on United's service to Greenland , which is launching this summer.\n\"Greenland is on the cusp of transformation,\" said Laali Berthelsen, local product manager for HX Expeditions and Nuuk resident. \"With the opening of our new international airport and direct flights, Greenland is more accessible than ever.\"\nHX will sail four Greenland itineraries on the 530-passenger Fridtjof Nansen -- from 12 to 26 days -- with the last sailing departing Aug. 16.\nHX said the itineraries have been created with input from Greenland communities and will operate along Greenland's west coast.\nJoining all voyages is Aleqatsiaq Peary, an Inuk storyteller, musician and hunter from Qaanaaq, who is the great-great-great-grandson of Robert Peary, the first person to reach the North Pole.",
