  "text": "Violinist Guy Braunstein is set to perform the United Kingdom premiere of his new Abbey Road Concerto alongside the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and conductor Eivind Gullberg Jensen on March 26, 2025.\nComposed during a \"period of Beatlemania while at home with his family\", the concerto incorporates classic Beatles hits such as \"Come Together,\" \"Oh Darling,\" \"Here Comes The Sun,\" and \"I Want You.\" Around these familiar tunes, Braunstein has worked in his own original material.\nThe concert also features inspirations from works by Anna Meredith and Dani Howard, as well as Elgar, Britten, and Vaughan Williams.\nThe concerto is available to listen to here , in a performance with conductor Alondra de la Parra and the Orchestre Philharmonique Royal de Liège on the Outhere Music label.\nBraunstein has conceived his own versions of Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin and Swan Lake , and has also written arrangements of Puccini arias and Dvořák’s opera Rusalka .\nOriginally from Tel Aviv, Braunstein studied with Chaim Taub — and then in New York with Glenn Dicterow , Pinchas Zuckerman , and Isaac Stern . In 2000, he became the youngest violinist ever to be appointed concertmaster of the Berliner Philharmoniker.",
