  "text": "Manchester United fans dropped their two cents on Altay Bayindir after he replaced Andre Onana for the Rangers clash in the Europa League at Old Trafford.\nThe Red Devils have seen a turnaround in results in the Europa League since Ruben Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag as Manchester United manager in 2024.\nUnited drew their opening three Europa League matches of the 2024-25 campaign under Erik ten Hag before the Dutchman was axed from Old Trafford last October.\nRuben Amorim picked up three wins in UEFA’s second-tier club competition ahead of Rangers arriving at Old Trafford for their match on Thursday evening.\nThe 39-year-old United manager watched the Red Devils suffer their first defeat of 2025 last Sunday with a 3-1 Premier League defeat to Brighton at Old Trafford.\nREAD MORE: Roy Keane reveals ‘frosty’ confrontation with Man Utd legend happened only once ‘in 12 years,’ both ‘went after each other’\nBayindir starts for Man Utd at Old Trafford\nAndre Onana was on the receiving end of a howler last weekend against Brighton and the Manchester United No 1’s mistake allowed Georginio Rutter to score.\nThe 28-year-old United shot-stopper showed promise at the start of the 2024-25 season, but Onana’s form and consistency took a major hit towards the end of 2024.\nRuben Amorim made the big call to drop Onana after his sloppy error against the Seagulls and he turned to Altay Bayindir for the Rangers clash.\nBayindir has had his own low points this season, including conceding from a direct corner in the Carabao Cup quarter-final defeat to Tottenham last December.\nHowever, the 26-year-old Turkish shot-stopper redeemed himself earlier this month with his superb performance against Arsenal in the third-round FA Cup win.\nDespite his heroics against the Gunners at the Emirates, Bayindir was dropped to the bench and Onana played in the win over Southampton and in the defeat to Brighton.\nBayindir returned between the sticks and the Turkey international put in a strong showing in the first half against Rangers at Old Trafford on Thursday evening.\nThe ex-Fenerbahce man, who was signed by former United manager Erik ten Hag in 2023, continued his strong display in the second half when he was called upon.\nHowever, Bayindir’s effort to secure a clean sheet was undone after United conceded at the hands of Rangers forward Cyriel Dessers in the 88th minute.\nREAD MORE: Denis Irwin singles out only Man Utd legend who was even comparable to Roy Keane, he was ‘tough’ and ‘aggressive’\nMan Utd fans react to Bayindir’s display vs Rangers\nRed Devils fans on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, praised Bayindir for a solid performance between the sticks against Rangers.\nOne United supporter insisted that “it’s only a matter of time” before Bayindir takes Onana’s spot as the No 1, with other Red Devils fans echoing the sentiment.\nAn X user wrote: “Bayindir in the post looks more comfortable than Onana. He deserves to be our first [choice] ‘keeper.”\nAnother said: “I’m more and more convinced that Altay Bayindir is our No 1, not Andre Onana!”\nSomeone else commented: “Bayindir has been impressive so far, and with performances like this, it’s only a matter of time before Amorim decides to bench Onana.”\n“Onana would’ve conceded that corner that Bayindir saved,” a fourth fan posted.\nWhile a fifth tweeted: “Bayindir makes me feel much more confident and comfortable when corners come in or shots.”\nSomebody else argued: “Why aren’t we playing Bayindir every week? He’s better than Onana and it’s not even close.”\nA seventh suggested: “Common knowledge: Bayindir should start over Onana.”\n“I actually think Bayindir is better than Onana,” another added.",
