  "text": "Winter Haven's Anthony Monteleone earns Mr. Golf, honored at Winter Haven basketball\nIt was a special night for lauded Winter Haven senior golfer Anthony Monteleone.\nPolk County golf history was created Wednesday night at Winter Haven High School when Monteleone was commemorated at halftime of the Winter Haven girls basketball game with the Dairy Farmer's Mr. Golf Award for his stellar performances in high school golf in 2024.\nWith the honor, Monteleone is the first Polk County athlete to win Mr. Golf since Sam Horsfield of Ridge Community won it in 2013.\nAnd the last Polk County athlete to win a Dairy Farmers Award was Bartow softball’s Red Oxley in 2013.\nThe coveted Mr. Golf award is given to the best high school golfer in Florida, and is a part of the Florida Dairy Farmers High School Sports Awards program. The program recognizes Florida’s stop student-athletes as well as coaches.\n“Being Mr. Golf feels amazing knowing that only one athlete from each sport gets picked throughout the whole state and to know I received it is amazing,” Monteleone said. “It also is crazy to think that I am the first to do it in over 10 years. It makes me feel very proud of myself.”\nMonteleone found out this week he was Mr. Golf. He said he knew very little about the award.\n“I honestly didn’t know much about the award but, I knew it was a big deal. I never really expected to get that award just because no one round here has got it recently so I wasn’t aware of the award,” he said.\nWinter Haven head boys golf coach Charlie James said he wasn’t surprised his golfer won the award, as he sees firsthand the kind of arduous work he puts in day in and day out.\n“I’m very proud of Anthony being named Mr. Golf,” James said. “The only people I know that are dedicated to working hard at golf as he does are PGA professionals. His parents are strong supporters and value his education. They as well as I look forward to seeing Anthony succeed in golf. I’m hoping that one day I will be able to see him play (as) a professional golfer in a major.”\nMonteleone has had a seminal career at Winter Haven, but in 2024 he was otherworldly. He was briefly ranked as the No. 1 golfer in the state of Florida before racking up an individual state, county, Crutchfield-Hawkins, the George Jenkins Invitational, and district titles to wrap up his stellar stint.",
