  "text": "In Jeremy Sochan’s (13 points and 9 rebounds) return to meaningful action, it was Victor Wembanyama - in his triumphant return to his home country - and Devin Vassell and their fellow Spurs that shot lights out (60%), assisted on 25 of their first 29 makes, and persistently outhustled their counterparts (13 offensive rebounds, 10 blocks, and 10 steals) to complete a 140-110 blitzing of the Indiana Pacers.\nFrance’s Ambassador of Basketball, Wembanyama (30 points, 11 rebounds, 6 assists, and 5 blocks), threw a party in front of his fellow citizens. Vassell (25 points, 4 assists, 2 steals, and 2 blocks), paired like a fine wine with his celebrated teammate to ensure there would be no Indiana comeback. Harrison Barnes (20 points, 7 rebounds, and 2 steals) played his role as glue-guy, while backup guard Tre Jones (11 points and 8 assists) had a solid effort off the bench, generously setting up teammates and finding his own offense in timely spots.\nIndiana was paced by an unfazed Benedict Mathurin (24 points and 2 steals) and Pascal Siakam (18 points and 6 rebounds). Obi Toppin chipped in 13 points with most of them coming in the opening half to bolster the Pacers attack.\nObservations\n- NBA Cobwebs had\nthis little gem of a memory for Spurs and Manu fans this morning. Two of Manu’s top fastbreak highlights occurred against Sacramento. - Pretty regrettable that the Pacers broadcasting crew was the one featured on NBA TV’s telecast.\n- Number of times that broadcast team pronounced his last name “WembanYANA” = over a dozen.\n- From the looks of where the Indiana bigs were launching their threes, it seems like the top of the key is the spot that was encouraged (Turner, Thomas Bryant, Toppin)\n- Devin’s Deeds: While he hit a slew of smooth shots tonight, he earned a deflection, as well, in the first quarter and outright got a steal late in the third period along with a handful of impressive set-up of teammates throughout.\n- Sequence of the Game #1: In the first couple of minutes, Wembanyama, after getting beaten off the dribble by Turner, still made up ground and blocked the Pacer’s attempt at the rim. Barnes converted a reverse lay-up downcourt.\n- Sequence of the Game #2: Late in the third quarter, after Buckner opined that “This game is a long way from being over,” Wembanyama, pinned Andrew Nembhard’s shot against the backboard, and set-up Sochan for easy alley-oop. On the next possession, Wembanyama swatted away TJ McConnell’s shot emphatically, and assisted on Julian Champagnie’s wing three. Wembanyama then blocked Toppin’s flailing attempt, and Sochan returned the favor to Wembanyama for an alley-oop. On Indiana’s fourth attempt to score, they DID get a goaltend on a late Wembanyama contest.\n- Tre Jones’ Podium Game(?): Jones stole an errant Indiana pass midway through the third and floated into the paint for a lay-up. He then kicked it out on the next possession to an open Keldon Johnson for a wing three to put the Spurs up 14.\n- Beautiful Game Sequence that honors Boris Diaw: In the last minute of the first half, the sequence went like this: Johnson -> Jones -> Vassell -> Sochan -> Vassell -> Wembanyama -> Sochan for a lay-up. You’ll have to watch it over and over to bask in the ‘good to great’ness.\n- Area 51: Wembanyama, after getting his own offense, found Castle with a feathery pass in transition midway through the opening frame to get the guard a lay-up.\n- Little-used: Spurs backups that got playing time as a result of the starters’ excellent work: Mamukelashivili, Sidy Cissoko, Blake Wesley, Malaki Branham.\nGame Rundown\nUnder the bright lights in Accor Arena, Vassell encouragingly hit two early jumpers, while Castle picked up two turnovers. Siakam and Haliburton connected from three to stake Indiana to a four point advantage. Wembanyama had his own 7-0 run to eke the Spurs into the lead. Tre Jones stripped TJ McConnell at the rim and followed a Johnson miss with a tip-in. Sochan impacted the game quickly with a driving jam and wing three. Former dunk contest champion Toppin hit a trio of threes (didn’t know that was in his bag now). Sochan spoonfed Wembanyama a pass that allowed the center to swish a three. San Antonio left a well-played first period up by one.\nChampagnie was whistled for two fouls in the first 30 seconds of the second. This allowed Mamukelashvili to get playing time and secure an offensive rebound. TJ McConnell’s lay-up kickstarted a 6-0 run. Mamukelashvili assisted on a Wembanyama drive and dunk and a wing three shortly after. Jones willed home a reverse lay-up, made a tough dumpoff to Johnson on the baseline for a power dunk, and set-up Vassell expertly for a transition three. San Antonio ravenously hit the offensive boards throughout the stanza and Johnson’s putback put them up three. Vassell willed home a shotclock beating floater to get San Antonio to the half up three.\nAt the start of hte third, a pair of corner threes from Harrison Barnes and Vassell put the Spurs up nine, but Turner countered with seven of his own. Barnes continued his yeoman effort with a driving lay-up and a tip-in. The Paul-Wembanyama battery paired - the first ending with a Wembanyama three and the second ending with a bankshot - to put San Antonio up 13. During one sequence, it looked like there were eight Spurs on the floor as they snagged offensive rebounds. Indiana briefly went into a zone, but Barnes’ wing three quickly ended that nonsense. Mathurin attacked the basket to put up seven points and shave the deficit. Jones came back into the game and immediately scored a transition bucket and assisted on a Johnson three. Sochan and Vassell found each other on consecutive possessions to put San Antonio up 90-71. In one memorable seqeuence, Wembanyama blocked three Pacers’ shots, and assisted on two San Antonio makes and received his own alley-oop at the other end. To perfectly tie a bow on this “piece de resistance,” Wembanyama tipped home a miss at the buzzer to put his team up 103-80.\nFor the Pacers fan’s perspective, please visit Indy Cornrows.\nThe teams play each other again on Saturday at 11:00 AM CDT.",
