  "text": "Cadillac has introduced its first-ever all-electric V-Series model, the 2026 Lyriq-V. The SUV is the most powerful Cadillac ever, surpassing all previous V-Series cars.\nCadillac estimates the power output of the dual-motor all-wheel-drive system to be 615 hp and 881 Nm of torque. This enables a blistering 0-97 km/h time of 3.3 seconds when Velocity Max is engaged, making it also the quickest Cadillac ever produced.\nThankfully, the performance doesn't come at the expense of practicality. The Lyriq-V comes with a 102 kWh battery pack, providing a Cadillac-estimated range of 459 km. Sure, it's not revolutionary, but this is a performance vehicle, and with that range, the Lyriq-V is an interesting option for drivers looking for a fast yet practical EV.\nCadillac has incorporated a suite of performance-focused features to enhance the driving experience. The V-Mode allows drivers to personalize performance settings, including Competitive Mode and a unique sound experience, accessible via a dedicated button on the steering wheel. The Competitive Mode improves the driving dynamics by optimizing traction management for increased agility.\nThe Lyriq-V's exterior design gets a unique front fascia, side rockers, and body-colored lower trim, along with available carbon fiber accents. The V-Series logo is prominently displayed on the rear doors and tailgate, while 22-inch wheels with a dark sports finish and an etched V-Series logo complete the aggressive look.\nInside the cabin, the Lyriq-V adds a bit of sportiness compared to the Lyriq. The interior features a uniquely styled steering wheel with a V-Mode button, and Regen On Demand paddle. Power-adjustable seat bolsters offer extra support during spirited driving, and the infotainment system gets a dedicated theme reflecting the V-Series persona.\nThe Lyriq-V will be available in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other markets. Production will start in early 2025 at General Motors' Spring Hill Manufacturing plant in Tennessee. With a starting price of €72,090, the Lyriq-V won't be the cheapest electric SUV out there, but this looks like a fair price for the fastest Cadillac ever.",
