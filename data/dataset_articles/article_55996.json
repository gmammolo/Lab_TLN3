  "text": "Korean rapper and actor Choi Seung Hyun, known as T.O.P, has made a notable return to the screen in 'Squid Game' Season 2, portraying the character Thanos. This role marks his first major appearance since his 2017 conviction for marijuana use, which led to a hiatus from the entertainment industry.\nIn 'Squid Game,' Thanos is depicted as a former rapper who becomes Player 230, participating in the deadly games. The character's background mirrors T.O.P's real-life experiences, adding depth to his portrayal.\nDirector Hwang Dong Hyuk expressed admiration for T.O.P's performance, stating, \"I'm very satisfied with what he did with the character.\" He also acknowledged the challenges T.O.P faced due to his past, noting that taking on such a role required \"a lot of guts.\"\nDespite initial controversies surrounding his casting, T.O.P's portrayal of Thanos has been met with praise, marking a successful comeback for the artist. His involvement in 'Squid Game' Season 2 not only highlighted his acting skills but also signified a new chapter in his career.\nT.O.P shared with NME, \"Then I ended up disappointing so many people and, at that time, I had to go through an intense darkness – so dark that it’s hard to imagine. There were some moments back then when I felt such intense and heavy shame that I just wanted to quit everything.” The artist continued, \"I did think that getting to portray a role like this character might end up leading to me being pigeonholed, especially because Squid Game is such a global series. This was a concern, not just personally but from people around me as well. But I also thought that, in a way, it almost felt like destiny that I met this character, which is what led me to gather my courage.\"\nT.O.P reflected on his character and explained, \"There’s a lot of connection with him and parts of my past and my past mistakes. I had to really sit down and think about if I was going to go through with it. I felt the only way to repay the trust that director Hwang had placed in me was for me to really do a good job in portraying Thanos.” The artist confessed he felt immense pressure to do well on this mega 'Squid Game' project. He explained, \"There was a lot of pressure, especially [because] initially in Squid Game, there are so many actors on set and so many members of the crew.When I first arrived, everything felt very surreal. To be a part of the 456 players of Squid Game and being there, having so many sets of eyes on me, I think that’s when it just really hit me that, ‘Oh, I am really a part of Squid Game'.”\nDuring his interview with NME, T.O.P also shared exciting news about his musical activities. He shared he is currently aiming to return as a musician to share his music. He explained, \"What I am currently hoping to do is share with the world T.O.P – me as a musician – because I will be sharing my music [for the first time] in almost a decade. The musician T.O.P would be the character that I want to play [now].\"\nNot only did T.O.P give insight into his portrayal of Thanos and his plans, but he also expressed his deep reflection over the years. He shared, \"Over the years, I spent a lot of time really thinking about and regretting what I have done, and I spent a lot of time on self-reflection as well. I think those years have allowed my musical universe to change greatly. I feel that my music has become richer and expanded in size as well, so I’m quite confident that my fans will feel that I have matured musically.\"\nFor more of T.O.P's in-depth interview, you can visit NME.\nSEE ALSO: [T.O.P shares Netflix gifts ahead of 'Squid Game 2' teaser]",
