  "text": "One Of The Best Destinations To Escape A Frigid Winter Is An Affordable Spanish City\nIf you are feeling the winter blues and working on a modest budget, Spain is one of the best spots in Europe to escape the freezing weather. Temperatures are mild during the coldest months of the year, and the thermometer rarely dips below 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) down south in Andalusia. While sun-seekers may be drawn by the beaches of Marbella and Málaga, the warm region is also famed for its history and culture, with cities like Granada, Córdoba, and Cádiz (one of the oldest in Europe) all worth adding to your itinerary. Arguably, the star of the show is Seville, a city that is easy on the wallet and winter packing requirements.\nLocated inland (around a five-hour road trip from Madrid), the Andalusian capital is a laid-back city of around 700,000 people. A settlement has existed here for well over 2,000 years, and it is said that the mythical hero Hercules founded the city on his travels. Conquerors and dynasties have come and gone, and Seville also has a rich place in the arts, providing a stomping ground for the legendary Don Juan and the backdrop for famous operas like \"Carmen\" and \"The Barber of Seville.\" The modern city is an underrated Spanish destination for your bucket list that you can explore in comfort throughout the year and enjoy at prices lower than more well-known tourist hotspots of Barcelona and Madrid. Let's take a look at some of the highlights.\nThings to see and do in Seville\nThe first port of call for many visitors to Seville is the wonderful Plaza de España. Constructed for the 1929 Ibero-American Exposition, its builders certainly pulled out all the stops to impress, creating a town square of sweeping grandeur. Enjoy people-watching while strolling the beautifully tiled colonnades and marvel at the Neo-Moorish architecture while enjoying a boat ride on the crescent canal.\nElsewhere, \"Game of Thrones\" fans will no doubt recognize the incredible Alcázar of Seville, a stunning royal palace made up of a dazzling array of architectural styles, from Moorish to Renaissance. Those who prefer Gothic stylings will have a field day at the gigantic Catedral de Sevilla, the largest Gothic cathedral in the world. Here, you can take in superb views from the top of the 800-year-old Giralda Tower and visit the tomb of Christopher Columbus.\nSeville has many events throughout the year, but one of the biggest and most spectacular is the Seville Feria (Seville April Fair). The vibrant week-long festival draws around 1 million visitors each year for a celebration of Andalusian food, dance, and culture. Returning to the matter of affordability, sports fans may savor the chance to experience world-famous La Liga soccer at the Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán Stadium, home of Sevilla FC. Tickets start out at 50 Euros ($51), a snip compared to seats at more illustrious clubs like Real Madrid and FC Barcelona.\nVisiting Seville on a budget\nVisiting a provincial city like Seville comes with generally cheaper costs than you might experience in bigger and more heavily-touristed Spanish cities. Accommodation can be very cheap if you aren't looking for a swanky option, with the price of one night in a budget hotel averaging around $49 (per budgetyourtrip.com). That's around $20 cheaper than equivalent digs in Barcelona. Even splashing out on a high-end stay is relatively modest, with costs per night in a luxury hotel averaging $143 a night compared to $233 in the Catalan capital.\nCorrespondingly, Seville also has an enticing range of restaurants and bars where you can dine without breaking the bank. One of the cheapest and most leisurely options is heading to Freiduría Puerta de la Carne, Seville's oldest fry shop. Fried seafood is a local tradition, and it pairs well with a crisp cold beer (Cruzcampo is the local lager) while enjoying the sunshine. If fish isn't your thing, ordering a tapas plate to share is a fun way to enjoy delicious bites with friends while also saving a few pennies. Seville has plenty of tapas bars to choose from, from the oldest joint in town (El Rinconcillo, opened in 1670) to traditional low-key stores like Casa Moreno, which serves simple platters of cheeses, cured meats, and other delicacies. With the price of beer averaging around 2 Euros ($2.06), a night on the town is also very affordable. All these factors make Seville a delightfully affordable warm-weather winter destination.",
