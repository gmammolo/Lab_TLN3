  "text": "DR. WALLACE: I'm a teenage boy who's always looking to make some extra side money. I mentioned this to my father, and he came up with an idea recently that the two of us could clean out our garage and donate a lot of old items we don't need or use anymore to free up space. It's a rather large garage and our family has only one car, so there's plenty of extra room.\nHe then suggested I go out on a Saturday morning and knock on the doors of all our neighbors, letting them know that we have extra storage space in our garage and would store the first item or small box for anyone free, then work out a reasonable rate for any other Items they may want to store with us.\nThis was about a month and a half ago. Things started slowly, but then I started getting calls from neighbors, and before too long we started working out a system to organize our garage into subsets and store various items for many of our neighbors. They were all too happy to pay us what they felt were reasonable rates for this extra storage space.\nNow less than two months later, my father's idea is working out too well! We filled up all the available space, even after building a small wooden rack to increase the height of the storage space available to us. At this point, I'm still getting some offers as the word of mouth has spread quickly around our community.\nI hate to turn down new business, but I'm very happy with the amount of monthly income my father and I are receiving for this extra storage space. He is putting half the money into a family \"vacation account\" and giving me the other half as direct income that I can save or spend as I would like, so this has been an awesome venture for me.\nMy question for you is one regarding my ideas for expansion. Do you think I should try to figure out a way to store more items or just be happy with what I have at this point? — Our New Business Is Flourishing, via email\nOUR NEW BUSINESS IS FLOURISHING: I think it depends on your father's perspective, but I see no problem with running a few new ideas by him.\nHe will, of course, want to monitor the amount of time you're spending on this venture in context with your schoolwork and other personal responsibilities.\nBut if you still have some discretionary time available, I have a couple of ideas for you. Since you and your father did a great job cleaning out and organizing your own family garage, you could spread word to your customers that you are willing to come in and customize anyone's garage with a custom-suited makeover. You and your father, or you and another friend, could do all the physical work — moving things, hauling away things that need to be donated or taken out as trash — and this would perhaps provide you another income opportunity.\nSecondarily, depending upon how much space you may have in your family's backyard or side yards, you and your father could discuss purchasing a standalone shed that you could use for extra storage to allow you to take on a few new customers. Alternatively, if there are public storage units available in your community you feel you could fill via piecemeal amounts of items from your neighborhood, you could consider renting a unit. You'd then sell sublet space at a higher per-square-foot rate so you could turn a profit if you're able to keep it mostly full going forward.\nWHY SHOULD AGE MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL?\nDR. WALLACE: I've noticed you often give advice to teenagers, even ones who are 18 or 19 years old and perhaps already during their first year in college, to wait a bit longer before considering marriage.\nWhy is this? Don't you feel that an 18- or 19-year-old is as capable of making a good decision regarding marriage as a 23- or 24-year-old would be? It seems to me that if you find someone who is \"the one,\" age shouldn't matter at all. — I Find Your Logic Curious, via email\nI FIND YOUR LOGIC CURIOUS: Marriage indeed is a very personal decision for the two individuals involved no matter what age they may be. However, with extensive experience dealing with teenagers, I can tell you that there are times when infatuation can be mistaken as love due to the inexperience of one or both partners.\nI do agree there are instances that work out quite well for some teenage marriages, but statistics show that the success rate at this age range is markedly below those who wait to wed until their early to mid-twenties or later.\nDr. Robert Wallace welcomes questions from readers.
