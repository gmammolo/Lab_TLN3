  "text": "Geisha bar opens in Japan's Hakone to offer nightlife entertainment for tourists\n(Mainichi Japan)\nHAKONE, Kanagawa -- A bar where local geisha entertain customers opened in this hot spring resort town Jan. 23, offering a chance for international and Japanese tourists to enjoy their evenings interacting with geisha.\nAt Geisha Cafe Bar Hana in the town of Hakone, Kanagawa Prefecture, \"Hakone Geisha\" serve customers, and will also sing and dance in front of guests at events starting next month. The bar is run by the \"Hakone-Yumoto Geino Kumiai\" entertainment association of 33 geisha houses, and is located inside their recently renovated office building.\nHakone Geisha generally entertain customers by singing and dancing in addition to serving food and beverages when dispatched to party venues. In around 1989 to 1990, there were apparently more than 400 geisha in the area. Due to a drop in the number of invites to functions, there are currently around 130 geisha belonging to the association, with ages ranging from 18 to in their 70s.\nThe association office houses a stage geisha have used for practicing dance and annual reviews of their skills. In around 2023, some of its members hit on the idea of making better use of the facility, as the stage was not in use in the evenings, according to association director and spokesperson Masako Takezawa. The association also received consultations from the Hakone Tourist Association, which said, \"There are few places that we can advise tourists to visit in the evenings.\"\nAt Geisha Cafe Bar Hana, two to three geisha take turns serving customers from 6 p.m. to midnight. The bar is equipped with a raised seating area in addition to a counter and tables. It was designed to allow visitors to casually drop by, with a red sign hanging outside and the kimono-clad geisha visible from the street.\nIo, a Hakone Geisha and staffer at the bar, commented, \"We still get puzzled as it's the first time for us to work in the restaurant business, but we've prepared for this all this time, day and night. I hope this place will be beloved in the neighborhood.\"\nThe bar is open every day in January. From February on, it will be closed on Sundays and Mondays, while on the first and third Saturdays a 40-minute event called \"Furatto Geisha\" will be held from 8 p.m., where geisha entertain guests with song and dance and make merry with them. The event is priced at 3,000 yen (approx. $19) including a drink.\n(Japanese original by Yuki Motohashi, Odawara Local Bureau)",
