  "text": "Star gazers ready to witness rare ‘planetary parade’\nLucknow: Sky enthusiasts are in for a rare celestial treat known as a planetary parade when six planets – Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus-- will align in the evening sky on Jan 25.\nLucknow University's department of mathematics and astronomy is organising a special viewing event for students, offering telescopic assistance to better observe this spectacle.\nThe alignment will be visible shortly after sunset, with Venus and Jupiter shining brightly, making them the easiest to spot. Mars will be seen higher in the sky with its distinct reddish hue. While Saturn will be visible to the naked eyes Uranus and Neptune will require telescopes due to their distance and dimness.\nProf Alka Misra of the department said: \"This planetary parade is fascinating occurrence. While alignments of 3 to 5 planets are common, the coming together of 6 or 7 planets is rare. Offering our students a glimpse of this vast and interconnected solar system will not only inspire curiosity but also foster a deeper understanding of the universe.\"\nSuch alignments are visually stunning and occur when planets appear close together in the sky due to their positions in their respective orbits. For the best viewing experience, stargazers are encouraged to visit areas with minimal light pollution, ensuring a clear and uninterrupted view of this celestial spectacle.",
