  "text": "Giannis Antetokounmpo at just 30-years-old has one of the greatest basketball resumes of all time.\nThe masses are hesitant to include him in the conversations of the greatest power forwards of all time, but he’s earned every right to be there.\nHis Accolades:\nNBA Champion NBA Finals MVP 2x NBA MVP NBA Cup Champion NBA Cup MVP 8x NBA All-Star NBA All-Star Game MVP 6x All-NBA First Team 2x All-NBA Second Team NBA Defensive Player of the Year 4x NBA All-Defensive First Team NBA All-Defensive Second Team NBA Most Improved Player NBA 75th Anniversary Team NBA All-Rookie Team This type of resume is one that players can only dream of. Antetokounmpo is in the middle of his prime and he’s still looking to add onto it.\nWhere Does He Rank Amongst Power Forwards?\nTim Duncan is the greatest power forward of all time, no debating. That crown will be held for a very long time, unless someone else can snatch it away.\nGuys like Karl Malone, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett and Charles Barkley are in the conversation as well as the greatest power forwards of all time.\nAll of these dominant players have won MVP’s due to their abilities and skill sets that wreaked havoc on the NBA for years.\nThe difference is, nobody besides Duncan has a more stacked resume than Antetokounmpo. His accomplishments will only increase as time goes on.\nAntetokounmpo is already in another MVP race for the 2024-25 season. He likely won’t win, but he’s for sure going to make the All-NBA First Team. At the age of 30, he’s already a first ballot hall of famer.\nHe is the second greatest power forward of all time, simple. It sounds like recency bias, but numbers and accolades do not lie. Nostalgia may carry people to believe Nowitzki, Malone, Garnett and Barkley are greater, but they simply are not.\nTheir skill sets may be prettier, their games may seem more polished, but Giannis’s dominance has been insane over the last five years.\nGiannis is averaging 31.5 points, 12.0 rebounds, 6.0 assists and 1.4 blocks per game on 60.5% shooting from the field in 2024-25.\nThere is absolutely no slowing down in sight for the Milwaukee Bucks star, and the world needs to recognize this.",
