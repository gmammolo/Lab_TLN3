  "text": "The Amazing Dinosaur Discovery is in town and will open at Awamoa Park Saturday and Sunday.\nManager Paul Johnson described it as a \"walk-through experience\".\n\"It’s everything you want to see and learn and do, dinosaur-style.\n\"You can choose to do what you want, when you want and you’ve got [90 minutes] per session to do that.\"\nThe display consists of 30 animatronic dinosaurs, the biggest of which is 10m tall.\nThere are also interactive learning stations, such as fossil digging to try out.\nMr Johnson said the event is suitable for ages \"2 to 92\".\n\"A lot of grandparents come and they find it as equally exciting and interesting as the little kids.\"\nThere will also be bouncy castles and face painting on both days.\nEach day has two sessions available to book and while there is a cost per ticket, there are family discounts available.",
