  "text": "Sauna hats provide several benefits and can enhance the overall experience. These hats protect the scalp and hair from excessive heat damage, help regulate body temperature and reduce dizziness.\nFor those on the market for a new sauna hat, the two-way Totonoi Towel by Totonoi Life is a worthy investment. The Totonoi Towel comes in three sleek colors — gray, navy and green — this compact towel seamlessly transforms into a sauna hat, combining style and functionality. All you need to do is pull the string and wrap it around your head.\nMade of ultra-fine Osaka Senshu towel yarn, it offers softness and durability. The towel absorbs moisture quickly to keep you dry and comfortable throughout your sauna session. Additionally, it features fasteners to ensure a seamless fit.\nAvailable on Amazon for ¥3,520.\nSource: PR Times",
