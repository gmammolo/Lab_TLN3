  "text": "In front of a raucous Wednesday night crowd inside Dickies Arena, Leandro Zampollo (Pirassununga, Brazil) proved to be the toughest cowboy of them all, outriding the field to be crowned PBR’s (Professional Bull Riders) Last Cowboy Standing at the Fort Worth Stock Show & Rodeo. The win propelled Zampollo from No. 60 to No. 26 in the race for the 2025 World Championship as he chases his first gold buckle this May.\nAfter an intense two nights and four rounds of competition, the winner of the PBR Last Cowboy Standing, presented by PlainsCapital Bank, came down to four men: Zampollo, Kaique Pacheco (Itatiba, Brazil), Brady Fielder (Clermont, Queensland, Australia) and Ezekiel Mitchell (Rockdale, Texas).\nZampollo, however, was nearly eliminated, only earning a spot in the penultimate round after Daniel Keeping (Montague, Texas) was unable to compete to injury.\nThe New York Maverick rider in the separate PBR Teams league advanced to Round 4 courtesy of an 82.75-point ride on Lieutenant Dan (Farris Cattle/Big Schott Rodeo) and an 84.75-point effort atop Stryker (Cooper/Scruggs Bucking Bulls).\nThe Austin Gamblers’ Pacheco remained in contention for his unprecedented fourth Last Cowboy Standing title after covering Renegade (Hale/Vella/Ogden/Hart) for 84.5 points, Younts Brody’s Pet (Farris Cattle/Big Schott Rodeo) for 79 points and Sucker Pop (Spencer/Sherman Cattle Co./Farris) for 87 points.\nA proud member of Fort Worth’s own Texas Rattlers, Fielder advanced courtesy of two 86.5-point rides, topping Oyster Creek Brawler (Farris Cattle/Big Schott Rodeo) and Mr. Right Now (Silent 7/Hilton Bull Co.).\nFor Mitchell, he punched his ticket to the final rounds of the progressive elimination event by conquering Body Roc (Cooper/Scruggs bucking Bulls) for 86.25 points and Rowdy (Ogden Ranch/Hart Cattle Co.) for 85 points.\nIn the fourth round, Zampollo, Pacheco, Fielder and Mitchell all failed to make the 8. As a result, each member of the quartet advanced to Round 5 as the slate wiped clean and the top scoring rider was prepared to walk away the winner.\nThe round began with 2018 World Champion Pacheco, however, he failed to convert, tossed by Magic Hunter (Martinez Bucking Bulls, LLC) in 1.11 seconds.\nFielder next took to the chutes paired with Constant Payne (Flying S/Kasel/Payne). While he initially appeared centered, he was ultimately whipped down in 5.57 seconds.\nThird out was Mitchell. Nodding with confidence on Rock ‘n Roll (Raymond & Coy Henry/Lidgard), he came down in a heartbreaking 7.01 seconds.\nAs a result of the buckoffs, the event came down to Zampollo on Bamboozle (Farris Cattle/Big Schott Rodeo). Bursting from the chutes, the reserved Brazilian matched the powerful animal athlete jump-for-jump en route to the requisite 8 as the crowd erupted in cheer. Awarded 86 points, the qualified ride clinched Zampollo the title of PBR Last Cowboy Standing.\nThe golden finish earned Zampollo a check for $61,695.24 in addition to a crucial 133 Unleash The Beast points. He rose from No. 60 to No. 26 in the race for the 2025 World Championship.\nPacheco finished second collecting 46 Unleash The Beast points. He climbed from No. 24 to No. 19 as he seeks his second gold buckle.\nThird was Fielder. Garnering 35 Unleash The Beast points, the affable Australian rose from No. 3 to No. 2 in the world. He now trails No. 1 John Crimber (Decatur, Texas) by 59.5 points. The Florida Freedom’s Crimber did not compete in Fort Worth due to injury.\nMitchell concluded the event fourth, netting 44 Unleash The Beast points.\nFor more information about the 2025 Fort Worth Stock Show & Rodeo please visit FWSSR.com.
