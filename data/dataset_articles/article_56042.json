  "text": "For the first time since 1978 — when they were still known as the Houston Oilers — the Tennessee Titans own the 1st overall pick in the NFL Draft . And while conventional wisdom would say that the Titans would use that pick to select the top quarterback on their draft board, a QB class that doesn't seem to include a ‘generational' prospect could force Tennessee to pivot and select someone else. An intriguing option is Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter, to who many draft experts are willing to assign that ‘generational' tag.\nOne draft expert in particular, NFL Network's Daniel Jeremiah, believes that Carter has the edge over all of the 200-plus players who will eventually be selected this coming April. And given comments made by Titans President of Football Operations Chad Brinker earlier this week regarding Tennessee's plan to use their pick on a ‘generational player,' there's a growing belief that Tennessee may decide to pass on a quarterback.",
