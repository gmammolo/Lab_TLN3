  "text": "By Liam Doyle & Erin Rose Humphrey ,\n28 minutes ago Peeling one of the world's most favorite foods is about to get a whole lot easier and significantly less monotonous, thanks to a mom's brilliant life hack that makes the skin peel off almost instantly.\nMost people who are preparing potatoes for dinner dread the task of peeling the vegetable , which can be time-consuming and challenging, especially after a long day at work. One woman has shared her innovative method that saves precious time and doesn't require a peeler.\nIn a video posted on TikTok, user @quitmyjob showed a pot full of boiling potatoes, with overlaid text reading: \"Why did I ever peel a potato? \" The woman in the video demonstrates how she cut a shallow hole around each potato and boiled them until they were soft.\nREAD MORE: Woman says you're storing fruit and vegetables all wrong - and it's costing you\nAfter taking them out of the pan, she effortlessly slips off the skins, which had separated from the main vegetable due to the millimeter-deep circular cuts. She even seemed to surprise herself after trying the method on camera, exclaiming: \"So crazy that's incredible! \".\nMillions of people have since watched the video, with thousands more expressing their astonishment in the comments and vowing to try it themselves. After the clip went viral - racking up more than 23.9 million total views - one commenter described the discovery as \"important information\", expressing their shock in all caps, while another added: \"I've learned more on the TikTok than anywhere else.\", reports the Mirror .\nA third commenter expressed their serendipitous timing: \"Literally just got done peeling 20 potatoes and open TikTok and this is the first video I see.\"\nWith Thanksgiving on the horizon, numerous US commenters highlighted the potential of this tip for the potato-centric holiday.\nOne TikTok aficionado joked about their pre-Thanksgiving prep, noting: \"Thank God I found this before I peel 500 potatoes tomorrow! \" Meanwhile, another recounted a holiday epiphany from last year's feast: \"I saw this right before Thanksgiving and this has changed my life.\"\nThe revelation that some people peel their potatoes was met with surprise by several users.\nOne stated bluntly: \"I don't even peel potatoes... everyone getting the skin lol.\"\nAnother chimed in with nutritional advice: \"People take the peel off? That's wild, literally all the fiber is in the peel, along with a good chunk of other nutrients.\"\nA third joined in, astonished, declaring: \"Who takes the skin off? ! that's the best part! ! ! \".\nAmid the praise for the potato-peeling hack, one user played the skeptic, half-seriously threatening to take legal action if the trick led to an undesirable outcome: \"If I try this and it doesn't work and I have to peel mushy potatoes I'm suing.\"\nthey quipped in the comments.",
