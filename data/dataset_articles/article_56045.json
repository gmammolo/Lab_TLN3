  "text": "By Angela Patrone & Samantha Ibrahim ,\n31 minutes ago Moss can pose a significant challenge to lawn care, as it severely impacts the health of grass . While fertilizers can aid in rejuvenating your lawn, most are ineffective during colder periods due to low ground and air temperatures.\nHowever, gardening experts at Lawn Smiths suggest an excellent alternative for winter lawn care - ferrous sulphate, also known as iron sulphate. For maintaining a lush lawn throughout the year, the professionals stress the importance of applying iron sulphate, even during winter.\nThey stated: \"Ferrous sulphate is great for grass . From greening in the summer to protecting in the winter and killing moss in spring, it's the perfect lawn treatment.\"\n\"Iron sulphate provides a wonderful deep green hue without necessitating extra mowing. It also helps keep the grass healthy during the cooler months.\"\nThis product replenishes the soil with nutrients during or after winter. Iron sulphate is available from various online stores and brands, reports the Express .\nThe Pro-Kleen Iron Sulphate is priced on Amazon. Customers have found this fertilizer effective in controlling moss growth and enhancing the greenness of their lawns.\nIt is easy to apply, comes with clear instructions, and many customers consider it good value for money. The Cleenly Iron Sulphate has been praised as \"excellent\" for treating moss. Alternatively, Pure Source Iron Sulphate is available on eBay.\nTo achieve a lush, verdant lawn, garden aficionados have a helpful tip: mix iron sulphate with water. This concoction will produce a \"superb green-up effect on the grass\" and is quite safe, provided there's an abundance of moisture around.\nFor a 100-meter square patch, mix 60 to 250g of iron sulphate (variable based on conditions and soil pH) with 100 liters of water. To handle the solution easily, take a 10-liter watering can, fill it with water, and add six to 25g of iron sulphate.\nExperts recommend using iron sulphate in dry, calm weather for maximum potency. A little watering post-application aids the soil absorption process, but you might also time your spreading before expected rainfall—though not during heavy showers that could wash the benefits away.\nThe specialists at Moowy note that iron sulphate \"eliminates moss within four days\" of treatment. Once applied, give your lawn some downtime to fully integrate the compound without disturbance, typically several weeks.\nAlso, beware of potential stains from iron sulphate; especially when working near stones, concrete, or pavements where unsightly marks could materialize.\n1",
