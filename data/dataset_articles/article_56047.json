  "text": "When Press Paws — Cat Café & Game Room first opened last Spring, my initial impression was that I’d died and gone to Cat Heaven.\nI like cats. I find them mostly soothing and entertaining (World’s Deadliest Hunters condensed down to, ideally, 10-to-more realistically-13-pound bags of fur and cuddliness).\nIn addition to being a coffee shop with an excellent selection of caffeinated beverages and snacks, Press Paws also has it’s own cat room that houses and entertains several felines up for adoption through the Des Moines County Humane Society.\nThe cat room sits at the front of the room, and guests can either stare down the furballs through the plexiglass or pay an entrance fee to hang out with them for an hour, either for your own amusement or as an opportunity to find out if you might be compatible with any of the cats and consider adopting them.\nRead the rest of the story in the Friday, Jan. 24 edition of The Hawk Eye newspaper.",
