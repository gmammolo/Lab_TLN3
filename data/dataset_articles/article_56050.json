  "text": "By Alana Loftus & Erin Rose Humphrey ,\n17 minutes ago McDonald's is taking fast food to a whole new level in Budapest with nightclub vibes for adults. The world's largest fast-food chain has re-launched a restaurant that morphs into a swanky club, complete with all-night DJ sets, thanks to Budapest's rule allowing clubs to stay open until 5 am.\nThis McDonald's branch, which is anything but ordinary, is located inside a railway station in Hungary's capital city. It first opened its doors last September and quickly became a tourist hotspot.\nOriginally planned to operate until the end of 2024, it's now set to run throughout 2025. But it's not stopping there - the restaurant, known for bringing fan-favorite items back , is due for a makeover to modernize its look. The station's historic interiors will be revamped to create a fresh setting for McDonald's innovative project.\nREAD MORE: McRib finally returning to McDonald's - but where exactly remains a mystery\nREAD MORE: Former McDonald's chef discovers where to buy best Big Mac sauce dupe from supermarket\nAccording to the Daily Mail, the space features moving light displays and art installations, including underwater scenes and journeys from outer space, reports the Irish Star .\nCustomers can marvel at the mesmerizing light shows and groove to a DJ set, all while tucking into their McDonald's meal. And of course, this upscale concept from the Golden Arches includes some exclusive menu items, like the Goosey Gustav burger topped with foie gras.\nThe beats are set to drop at 10 pm and keep thumping until the wee hours of 4 am at Nyugati's revamped eatery, according to their site: \"We invite everyone to a special journey to the renovated Nyugati restaurant, where our Nyugati Lounge music program has started.\"\n\"From now on, every Friday and Saturday evening, between 10 pm and 4 am - in addition to your Mekis favorites - we will be waiting for you with light painting and a DJ in one of the world's most beautiful McDonald's restaurants. Come and join us either to tune in before the party or to close the evening and let's travel together to the depths of the sea, the rainforest, or even among the stars! \".\n1",
