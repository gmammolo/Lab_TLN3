  "text": "The third Final Fantasy VII remake title is in full development with its story script completely finished\nThe PC version of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has just been released, and Japanese outlets are celebrating it by publishing interviews with Yoshinori Kitase and Naoki Hamaguchi. Famitsu and 4Gamer's interviews in particular also happened to cover the development of the upcoming third entry, which will be the last one in the FFVII remake trilogy project.\nHamaguchi revealed in both interviews that his team started working on the third title right after finishing the original PS5 release of FFVII Rebirth, which would be around March or April 2024. As of the end of the year, they had completed a game build that let him grasp the gameplay experiences the team wants to achieve with the final entry. As they enter the new year in 2025, they are starting to actually build the whole game based on the direction they have agreed upon.\nKitase then added that when he was interviewed just before the PS5 release of FFVII Rebirth in February 2024, Kazushige Nojima had already somewhat done the scenario for the third title, but it still needed more polishing. Tetsuya Nomura had instructed his team to make it as a proper conclusion for the remake project that, while still respecting the original PS1 release, lets players feel a sense of satisfaction that wasn't there before. Kitase could now finally report that the story script for the third entry is finally completely done.\nThe interviews also noted a concern that there was a long gap between the releases of FFVII Remake for PS4 and FFVII Rebirth for PS5. Hamaguchi tried to assuage the concerns in both interviews. In the 4Gamer interview, he noted how the team wants to release the game on a broader range of platforms, while on Famitsu, he predicts that the gap between the console and PC versions for the third entry would be shorter than before.\nIt will still take quite a while until we see a public reveal of the third and last entry in the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy project. Until that time comes, you can get and play the first title Final Fantasy VII Remake and the second entry Final Fantasy VII Rebirth; both of which are available worldwide on PlayStation 5 and PC.",
