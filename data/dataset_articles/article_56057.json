LOUIS — The St. Louis City Fire Department conducted ice water rescue training to prepare for emergencies related to winter weather and thin ice.\nThe training involved about 30 tactical firefighters from Engine House One and Engine House Eleven, who are part of the Marine One task force. This specialized unit handles various rescue missions, including swift water and ice rescues, especially important as temperatures drop below freezing.\n“They’re going to start losing their ability to think properly, respond to verbal commands, and eventually just pass out, and it’s a very rapid process; in a matter of minutes it will happen,” said Captain Ross Hetz of the St. Louis City Fire Department.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement “I don’t know that we get scared; when the time comes, we do our job; we don’t really think about being scared,” said Ian McGahan, a fire private with the St. Louis City Fire Department.\n‘Imo’s Pizza is my ayahuasca;’ Jimmy Kimmel explains distaste for St. Louis staple\nThe training took place near the Benton Park Pond in South City, where ice can pose a significant danger to children and pets. The firefighters practiced scenarios involving self-rescue and victim rescue on the ice.\nThe US Army Corps of Engineers reports a 500% increase in drowning risk due to the shock of cold water, highlighting the importance of this training. With the specialized training, the St. Louis City Fire Department is better prepared to handle ice-related emergencies, ensuring safety for both the rescuers and those in need of rescue.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement All facts from this article were gathered by KTVI journalists.
