  "text": "BY ALEXANDER HERNANDEZ GONZALEZ JANUARY 23, 2025\nFounder and creative director Alexandre Mattiussi captured the authentic essence of Parisian chic at AMI’s Fall/Winter 2025 runway show. Celebrating everyday luxury by elevating everyday silhouettes while maintaining comfort was the main priority for this season’s collection. Mattiussi referenced numerology and how the number 2025 represents the boldness and serenity that his lucky number, nine, also does. This feel-good collection combines modernity and heritage, empowering both men and women to feel optimistic about the future. Here are the five things you need to know about AMI’s latest collection.\nSLOUCHY SUITS\nIt’s official: suits can be an everyday type of outfit. Whether you want a dark green wool suit to wear to a coffee date or a multi-chromatic look consisting of gray, olive green, brown, mustard yellow, and black, this silhouette makes a traditionally professional look into an oversized yet tailored style for anyone to wear.\nPLAID IS BACK, BABY\nA caramel and black plaid came down the intimate runway, allowing for a well-known print to take shape within the AMI world. Skirts, blazers, and a stunning trenchcoat take on the pattern, adding a bit of eye candy to monochromatic tops and bottoms. These three small but mighty looks show the versatility that plaid can bring to a wardrobe.\nWORKWEAR IS NOT JUST FOR WORK\nWith pieces of clothing such as blouses, dresses, and the classic button up shirt, AMI redefined what workwear can be transformed into on a daily basis. Short-sleeved blazers, luxurious gray shearling coats, and flowy turtleneck shirts are not just office-attire; rather, these workwear essentials easily belong in every space.\nBROWN SUEDE IS FASHION’S COZIEST\nEven though brown and suede are traditionally associated with the fall season, why not mix them together to create fall’s new favorite duo. Button-up jackets and slouchy handbags are great pieces to add to your wardrobe. Yet, a rich yet sophisticated brown skirt paired with the classic oversized brown wool jacket, dark brown handbag, and oxblood boots show what brown suede can and will bring to the public during the colder seasons.\nSILK IS NOT JUST FOR THE BED\nWhen we think of silk, we usually associate it with nightwear and the breathability that it brings to our bodies. But, silk can be worn out on a daily basis, regardless of what the day may have in store. Eye-catching muted silk dresses and blouses, dress shirts with silk panels, and a stunning muted chartreuse wrap coat with a silk collar demonstrate how to fashionably style silk on a daily basis.\nScroll through the gallery below to see every look from AMI’s Fall/Winter 2025 collection.",
