  "text": "NESTLED ALONG CENTRAL VIETNAM’S stunning coastline, InterContinental Danang Sun Peninsula Resort is amongst the region’s most beloved and recognised resorts. Beyond offering deeply luxurious escapes, the resort is the ideal gateway to Hoi An’s Ancient Town, where guests discover enchanting neighbourhoods, picturesque architecture, artisanal crafts, and romantic, lantern-lit boat rides.\nThe Bill Bensley-designed property elevates the guest experience through immersive cultural programming, including curated design tours that showcase the resort’s architectural brilliance.\nThe resort is also a foodie’s paradise, with a team of culinary creatives putting their talent and passion into introducing guests to bold flavours and gastronomic adventures in a sophisticated sanctuary.\n“Guests staying at resorts are extremely interested in dining — it’s a big focus when you’re on vacation — so we are trying to push boundaries even further to create truly unparalleled experiences. It’s a never-ending goal and we hope people will come to try. We look forward to showcasing our exciting new menus to all discerning diners in the coming weeks and months,” said Seif Hamdy, General Manager, InterContinental Danang.\nCentral Vietnam’s Only Michelin Star\nInterContinental Danang Sun Peninsula Resort’s La Maison 1888 achieved a historic milestone in June, becoming Central Vietnam’s first and only Michelin-starred restaurant.\nThis prestigious recognition was part of an extraordinary year of culinary evolution, transforming the resort into a gastronomic destination as well as an acclaimed beachfront getaway.\nThe arrival of legendary French chef Christian Le Squer in mid-2024 marked another significant milestone. Bringing 22 consecutive years of three-Michelin-star excellence from Paris — as well as his 2023 global “Chef of the Year” accolade, Chef Le Squer infuses La Maison 1888 with his distinctive Champs Elysees-inspired sophistication. His innovative approach to haute cuisine blends culinary mastery with stylish presentations, creating immersive dining experiences that captivate guests.\nChef Le Squer creates side-by-side with Chef de Cuisine Florian Stein, whose expertise was honed at France’s celebrated Le Chambard. These chefs’ prestigious backgrounds and culinary knowledge have elevated La Maison 1888 to unprecedented heights, establishing it as one of Asia-Pacific’s must-visit dining destinations.\nPassion Meets Talent\nThe culinary excellence at InterContinental Danang extends beyond its acclaimed restaurant through a collection of exceptional talent.\nBeverage Manager Jimmy Chang’s expertise has secured Wine Spectator’s “Award of Excellence” for the sommelier for seven consecutive years, while newly appointed Director of Culinary Bruno Bruesch brings three decades of global epicurean mastery to the resort.\nThe Switzerland native has elevated the renowned brunch buffet to new heights and is introducing innovative family-style dining concepts at Citron, the resort’s Vietnamese dining venue.\nAdding to this culinary constellation, the resort also introduced Tingara, a distinctive Japanese dining experience whose name poetically translates to “River of Stars.” Led by Michelin-starred Chef Junichi Yoshida, this new restaurant combines premium Japanese ingredients with local herbs to create unprecedented teppanyaki and sushi dishes. Of course, no evening at Tingara is complete without trying a few of the restaurant’s imaginative sake and champagne pairings.\nInterContinental Danang Sun Peninsula Resort exemplifies luxury hospitality through its extraordinary culinary achievements. From La Maison 1888’s historic Michelin star to Tingara’s innovative Japanese cuisine, the resort creates unforgettable experiences through world-class dining, sophisticated accommodations and immersive experiences.\nFor more information and to embark on your gastronomic adventure at InterContinental Danang, please contact +84 236 393 8888 or visit www.danang.intercontinental.com.\nArticle Sponsored by InterContinental Danang Sun Peninsula Resort.\nImages courtesy of InterContinental Danang Sun Peninsula Resort.",
