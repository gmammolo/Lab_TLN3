  "text": "By Vik Raghupathi ,\n6 hours ago\nPHILADELPHIA (KYW Newsradio) — A few members of the Philadelphia Phillies stepped up to a different kind of plate Wednesday evening. They served hot meals to the less fortunate at a church in Kensington.\nA little less than a month out from spring training, utilityman and Millville, New Jersey native Buddy Kennedy carried trays full of food to folks at St. Francis Inn on Kensington Avenue.\n“Whatever I can do to help in any way, I’m always down for it,” Kennedy said. “It just shows how blessed I am, and if I can bless somebody else, it’s a true honor for me.”\nKennedy was joined by fellow Phillies Cristopher Sanchez, Weston Wilson and Kody Clemens. They waited on dozens of guests during a restaurant-style meal, which included chicken stew over stuffing, a PB&J, an apple and some cake.\n“To do some community events together, get talking, see how the offseason was but also feed the homeless, it’s a special bond for all of us,” he added.\nSt. Francis Inn feeds about 150 to 200 people a day. It has seven full-time staff members who are joined each day by two dozen or so volunteers.\n“It takes an extraordinary amount of planning and effort, but it takes a huge amount of dedication from our staff and our volunteers, and we couldn’t do anything without them,” said Marissa Ryan, a full-time team member.\nPrepping, cooking, serving and cleaning is a full-day ordeal but completely worth it, she said.\n“Especially during a Code Blue, but all times of the year. Being fed is such a crucial aspect of being alive,” said Ryan. “Having a place where you can go, sit for a half an hour, talk to your friends and get warm — it’s a really beneficial place to be.”\n48",
