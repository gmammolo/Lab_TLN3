Last year, the largest overall fish was caught by 9-year-old Blain Stanford, who caught a trout weighing 0.9 pounds.\nThe event is free with no fishing license required, but participants should bring their own fishing gear if they have it, plus a supervising adult. As children catch fish, they will be registered for prizes at the weigh-in station at the pond.\nNacogdoches Fire and Rescue will also attend the event to grill sausages.\nAndrew Hodge's email is andrew.hodge@dailysentinel.com.\n{{description}}\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\nKeep it Clean.
