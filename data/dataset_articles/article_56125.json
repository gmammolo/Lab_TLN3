  "text": "Neighbors Magazines\nLuxury home decor gets prehistoric: Ancient stones light up modern spaces\nUsing ancient stones up to 2,000 million years old, Steinbild transforms rejected quarry pieces into illuminated wall art, with each piece telling its own story from Earth's distant past\nPARK CITY, Utah — Greg Kathan never expected a German catalogue would change his career path. When his best friend asked him to translate it to English, Kathan discovered something remarkable. “That’s really good,” he told his friend after reading it. “Who’s going to sell it?” His friend smiled and said, “You,” which is how Kathan became the president of USA sales for the German-based company, Steinbild. “I’ve been a pilot for United Airlines for 27 years,” he says. “But I fell in love with the product.”\nIt’s easy to understand why. Steinbild makes incredible works of art using natural stones that are millions of years old.\n“My best friend has a stone manufacturer business in Europe — they buy from quarries all over the world,” Kathan said. “He and his family came up with the idea of using the stones that can’t be manufactured or used for commercial projects as art. Some are between 100 to thousands of millions of years old. Currently, our oldest slab is 2,000 million years old.”\nSteinbild’s cutting machine slices these ancient stones into thin slivers, some just 2/8-inch thick. The stones are then set in top-quality frames crafted by master carpenters. “No one has the same picture because each stone is different,” Kathan said. “They’re not flat, you can feel the crevices and dents. Each one is extremely unique, and each piece is 100% natural, we don’t use chemicals to preserve the stone. No one else is doing this like we are.”\nKathan, his wife Melanie, and their son moved to Utah 8 years ago after they visited friends living at the Hideout Canyon near Jordanelle Reservoir. They loved the Wasatch Mountains so much, they bought a home and moved in just 5 weeks. Called the Little Alps by many, Midway reminded Greg of the Allgäu Region in Bavaria where he grew up, and Switzerland where he skied. “I am a big skier, so that helped our decision to stay here,” he says. “There is so much outdoor beauty: lakes, rivers, fishing, boating, camping, exploring, and skiing. I love the seasons. It’s very similar to Europe so I can associate with this area.”\nWhen Kathan and Melanie met in Houston 24 years ago, it was love at first sight. He flew her to Dallas where she lived and, after a 69-day whirlwind romance, they married. They’ve been together happily ever since, enjoying the outdoors, traveling, and scuba diving. Their son lives in Huntsville and is studying to follow in his father’s footsteps as a pilot, and Kathan’s oldest daughter lives in Germany.\nThe couple works together to sell these stunning pieces. “We love that this is a family business and want to bring it to the valley,” Kathan said. “There are so many art connoisseurs and designers here that really appreciate the value of these pieces and want something that no one else has. So, it’s a perfect location for us.”\nSteinbild offers different lines that range in size and variety of stone. The Soul Line is crafted from healing stones. These small pieces are ideal for spas or bathrooms. The Focus Line uses a variety of stones in different shapes and can be customized for décor and backlit for illuminated wall art. The Essential Line uses limited-edition stones that can be cut into larger formats: 20-by-20 inches to 3-by-3 feet. These can also be sliced into mirror images of the same stone and framed to look like butterfly wings.\nAnd finally, the masterpieces. These one-of-a-kind murals are commissioned, handcrafted, and chosen specifically for the space.\n“Our stone designer is an old German craftsman,” Kathan said. “He cuts each piece to fit your wall space.” After they are cut with a spinning diamond rope (imagine cutting a block of ancient stone the size of your living room couch into ultra-thin slices), they are custom framed and shipped directly to your house. “Some weigh 30 to 40 pounds, the bigger they get, the more they weigh,” he says. “For example, a 4-by-5-foot picture may weigh 60 pounds. A 9-by-3-foot picture may weigh 100 pounds, but they can be hung easier than you think.”\nSteinbild works with designers, businesses, art galleries, and homeowners. They currently sell online but have a small home gallery for in-person viewing. Call ahead to schedule an appointment.\nEach stone tells a story of existence on the planet — some from as far back as the ice age with extinct creatures and a changed landscape. Now, you can hear their whispers in your own home.",
