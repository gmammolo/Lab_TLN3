They’re crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and packed with the fresh, savory flavor of green onions. But if you’ve ever had them and thought, there’s no way I can pull that off at home, think again! Scallion pancakes are surprisingly beginner-friendly, made with just a few pantry staples and a little rolling and frying. Whether you’re planning a Lunar New Year feast or just craving a tasty snack, I’ve got the perfect step-by-step guide to help you whip up these golden, flaky beauties in no time. The best part? You don’t need to be a pro in the kitchen to get that perfect crunch. Here’s how to make restaurant-worthy scallion pancakes from scratch.\nWhat are scallion pancakes?\nScallion pancakes, or cong you bing, are a classic Chinese flatbread made with simple ingredients like flour, water and scallions. Unlike traditional pancakes, these are unleavened and layered, giving them a distinct chewy texture. The key to their signature flakiness lies in the rolling and layering process, which creates deliciously crispy edges when pan-fried.\nHistorically, scallion pancakes have been a beloved street food and comfort dish in Chinese cuisine. They are thought to have originated in northern China where wheat-based dishes are more common. Despite their simplicity, these pancakes represent resourcefulness and skill, transforming humble ingredients into something truly delicious.\nGather your ingredients\nYou’ll need just a handful of basics to get started:\n- All-purpose flour\n- Boiling water\n- A pinch of salt\n- Thinly sliced scallions\n- Sesame oil or vegetable oil, for frying\n- For dipping, soy sauce mixed with a little rice vinegar and chili oil is a must\nThe secret to those flaky layers\nThe magic of scallion pancakes lies in the technique. After making the dough, you’ll roll it out, brush it with oil and sprinkle on the scallions. Then repeat: roll the dough into a disk, coil it into a spiral and roll it out again. This process creates those irresistible layers that crisp up when cooked. Here’s a quick tutorial for how to do it.\nTips for scallion pancake success\nScallion pancakes are deceptively simple, but a few pro tips can take yours from good to irresistible.\nRest the dough\nDon’t skip the resting step after kneading! Resting allows the gluten in the dough to relax, which makes rolling it out much easier and results in a tender, flaky pancake. Cover the dough with a damp cloth to keep it from drying out. Even just 30 minutes of resting can make a big difference.\nUse boiling water\nTraditional scallion pancake dough is made with boiling water, which helps create a soft and pliable texture. The hot water partially cooks the flour, making the pancakes chewier and easier to roll out without tearing.\nGo generous with the scallions\nThe more scallions you use, the better the flavor! Make sure they’re finely chopped to spread evenly and avoid clumping. If you’re worried about them burning, add a little sesame oil to the filling to help protect them during frying.\nGet the heat right\nUse medium heat to fry your pancakes. Too hot, and the outside will burn before the inside cooks; too low, and you’ll lose the crispiness. A few tablespoons of neutral oil (like vegetable or canola) in a nonstick pan works best for even cooking.\nExtra-flaky scallion pancakes recipe\nWhat better way to celebrate Lunar New Year than with some fried dough? Here’s an easy recipe from Serious Eats. Pair it with a dipping sauce made from soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sugar, ginger and more scallions.\nIngredients:\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting work surface\n- 1 cup boiling water\n- ~¼ cup toasted sesame seed oil\n- 2 cups thinly sliced scallions\n- ¼ cup vegetable oil, for frying\n- Kosher salt, to cook\nDirections:\n- Total Time: 85 minutes\n- Yield: 4 pancakes\n- In a large bowl, add flour and ¾ of boiling water. Stir until dough comes together, adding water a tablespoon at a time as needed.\n- Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead a few times to form a smooth ball. Transfer to a clean bowl, cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.\n- Divide dough into four even pieces and shape each into a smooth ball. Working one ball at a time, roll out into a disk roughly 8-inches in diameter on a lightly floured surface. Paint a very thin layer of sesame oil over the top. Roll disk up like a jelly roll, then twist roll into a tight spiral, tucking the end underneath. Flatten gently, then re-roll into a disk.\n- Paint with another layer of sesame oil, sprinkle with ½ cup scallions and roll up again. Twist into a spiral, flatten and re-roll into a 7-inch disk. Repeat steps two and three with remaining dough balls.\n- Heat oil in an 8-inch nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Carefully slip pancake into hot oil. Cook, shaking pan gently, until first side is an even golden brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip with tongs and continue to cook on the other side, about 2 minutes.\n- Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Season with salt and cut into six wedges. Repeat with remaining three pancakes. Serve immediately with dipping sauce of choice.\nCopyright 2025 A360 Media\nThis story was originally published January 23, 2025 at 3:30 PM.",
