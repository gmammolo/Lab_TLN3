  "text": "Living\nWoman at Airport Spots Her Doppelganger, Convinced ‘Matrix is Glitching’\nOne woman was surprised and amused when she saw someone who looked exactly like her while in the airport.\nIt's not often that we see a doppelgänger of ourselves out in the world. So when it does happen, it can often take us by surprise and make us wonder, what are the chances of this happening?\nTikTok user, taytaybax23, or Tay Tay, had that exact experience when they were in an airport getting ready to board a flight. In a video posted to the social media site, which has received more than 300,000 views since it was first shared on January 20, we see a woman with a light blue shirt, bright pants, and straight jet-black hair that falls down just past the shoulders walking with her suitcase.\nIn the clip, the camera then turns to Tay Tay, who has the exact same hair and appears to be wearing the same outfit, apart from the shoes and the bag.\n\"Either she's my twin or the matrix is glitching at the airport,\" she wrote in the caption of the video.\nAs air travel soars to new highs, we pass by huge numbers of strangers while traveling through airports. According to Statista, over 38 million flights were taken last year around the world.\nIn the U.S., domestic travel also proves to be a busy industry, with over 819 million people having flown from one American airport to another in 2023.\nTay Tay's video received hundreds of comments from other TikTok users sharing their thoughts and reactions to the clip, as well as over 35,000 likes.\nOne user with the moniker blackarican85, shared: \"I saw another doppelgänger video earlier! This is scary\" along with a laughing face emoji.\nLucy Nioa commented: \"The way I literally thought I was the doppelgänger, but realized I have not been anywhere near Melbourne. This is my exact travel outfit, bags and all.\"\n\"Omg this is the second doppelgänger video I've seen today. This is crazy,\" said Jade.\nKayla wrote: \"This happened to me three times once. I couldn't stop geeking. 3 of us all sitting in a triangle. Exact same hair, glasses, jackets.\"\n\"This the 3rd doppelgänger video I've seen, I'm getting a bit uneasy at this point,\" said one user with the name T.\nMish shared: \"it's such an uncomfortable experience for some reason. I respect her for maintaining such a close distance.\"\nHas a dream vacation turned into a nightmare? Whether it's a missed flight or lost luggage, we want to hear about your travel disasters.
