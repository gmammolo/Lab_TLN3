  "text": "OrdonezWenzke has breathed new life into a 1930s house in Vicente López, Argentina , seamlessly blending respect for its original character with modern functionality and a touch of contemporary design. The Segurola House, as it’s known, focuses on a thoughtful remodeling and expansion designed to meet the specific needs of a family of art and book enthusiasts.\nThe ground floor underwent a significant transformation, prioritizing a more open and fluid living space. The existing service block, comprising the kitchen, laundry room, and toilet, was completely reorganized. Recognizing the importance of connection, the architects prioritized the flow between the kitchen and the living-dining area.\nA new opening was created, and the kitchen was strategically placed against the dividing wall, optimizing space and creating a natural hub for the home. The original toilet was repurposed into a convenient pantry, while a new, more accessible toilet was placed closer to the entrance.\nWhile the kitchen embraced a modern aesthetic, the living-dining area became a testament to the home’s history. OrdonezWenzke meticulously restored many of the original features, including the elegant archways, the classic flooring, and the detailed ceiling. This dedication to preservation creates a striking contrast with the contemporary kitchen design.\nThe kitchen itself is a study in clean lines and subtle color. A single, large piece of custom cabinetry in a soft pastel green anchors the space. This is complemented by a sleek grey countertop with a raised backsplash, creating a clean and cohesive look. A strategically placed skylight floods the kitchen with natural light, enhancing the sense of openness and airiness.\nUpstairs, the architects maintained the original layout of the bedrooms, respecting the home’s existing structure. However, they introduced key upgrades to enhance functionality and comfort. An existing study was transformed into a new terrazzo-clad bathroom for the child’s room, adding a touch of modern sophistication. The master bathroom was also redesigned to incorporate a much-needed dressing room, adding practical storage and enhancing the suite’s usability.\nPerhaps the most impressive intervention is the transformation of the previously inaccessible crawl space under the roof. Originally housing only water tanks, this underutilized space was given new purpose. By reinforcing the existing structure and adding a sleek, white sheet metal staircase, OrdonezWenzke created a valuable new living area. This flexible space now serves as a work area and additional living space, complete with a library—a crucial element for a family that values books and art.\nThe Segurola House is a testament to OrdonezWenzke’s ability to balance respect for historical context with contemporary design principles. By carefully considering the family’s needs and creatively reimagining existing spaces, they have created a home that is both beautiful and functional, a seamless blend of past and present. The project stands as a successful example of how thoughtful renovation can revitalize a classic home for modern living.",
