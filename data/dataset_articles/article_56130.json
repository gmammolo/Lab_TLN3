  "text": "AFINN ‘s recent project, Apartment am Lokdepot in Berlin, is more than just a renovation ; it’s a carefully curated experience, a dialogue between cultures and materials. Drawing inspiration from travels to Japan and Brazil, the design team has crafted a serene urban retreat that balances minimalist aesthetics with warm, tactile elements.\nLocated in a quiet corner of central Berlin , the apartment immediately establishes a sense of calm upon entry. A continuous wooden wall guides visitors through the space, gently leading them towards the heart of the home: the open-plan kitchen and living area. This deliberate flow, reminiscent of traditional Japanese spatial arrangements, creates a sense of anticipation and discovery.\nThe double-height volume of the living space is a key feature, bathed in natural light that streams through the glazed facade. Sheer linen curtains filter the daylight, casting a soft, diffused glow that enhances the room’s tranquil atmosphere. This interplay of light and shadow, a recurring theme in both Japanese and Brazilian architecture, adds depth and dynamism to the space.\nThe kitchen, a bespoke creation by a local carpenter, is a testament to the project’s commitment to craftsmanship. Constructed from rich cherry wood, it exudes a warm, inviting presence. A floating island, crafted from brushed steel, provides a sleek counterpoint to the natural wood, creating a striking visual contrast. This juxtaposition of materials – warm and cool, natural and industrial – is a recurring motif throughout the apartment.\nA long, narrow dining table, imbued with a rich patina, adds a touch of history and character to the clean backdrop of seamless limeplaster floors. This subtle layering of textures and materials creates a sense of depth and complexity, preventing the minimalist aesthetic from feeling sterile.\nA meticulously crafted joinery wall acts as a functional and aesthetic divider, separating the social spaces from the more private areas of the apartment. This clever design element seamlessly integrates doors, wardrobes, kitchen cupboards, and storage cabinets, maximizing space and creating a sense of order and cohesion. This focus on functionality and integrated storage echoes the principles of Japanese design, where efficient use of space is paramount.\nBehind this joinery wall lie two peaceful bedrooms and a small study, all overlooking a lush garden. This connection to nature, a common thread in both Japanese and Brazilian architecture, provides a welcome respite from the urban environment.\nThe restrained material palette further enhances the apartment’s serene atmosphere. Cool greys of exposed concrete, limeplaster floors, brushed steel, and Italian limestone provide a neutral backdrop, allowing the warmer hues of cherry wood and the soft texture of linen to take center stage. This carefully considered balance of warm and cool tones, rough and smooth textures, creates a harmonious and inviting environment.",
