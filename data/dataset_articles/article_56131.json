  "text": "By Rhea Caoile ,\n4 days ago\nSAN DIEGO (FOX 5/KUSI) — The semifinalists for the coveted 2025 James Beard Awards were announced Wednesday and two San Diego-area chefs plus one local bar made the list.\nTara Monsod, the executive chef of Animae in downtown San Diego and Le Coq in La Jolla, was named a semifinalist in the Best Chef: California category this year. This is the second year being nominated for Monsod, who made history last year as the first chef ever from San Diego to make it to the final round.\n(Above: FOX 5/KUSI’s Allie Wagner spoke with Tara Monsod on May 7, 2024 about her nomination in the 2024 James Beard Awards)\nMonsod has more than a decade of kitchen experience, bringing flavors inspired by her Filipino heritage to the forefront of her culinary craft at the Asian fusion restaurant, Animae. Last February, it was announced she would also take the helm as executive chef at Le Coq, a modern French-influenced steakhouse in La Jolla.\nCelebrate the Lunar New Year with culture, food and entertainment at this festival Both restaurants are owned by celebrity chef Brian Malarkey, who also owns Herb & Wood in Little Italy and Herb & Sea in Encinitas.\nJoining Monsod on the list of semifinalists for Best Chef: California is Robert Alcocer of Valle in Oceanside. The Baja-inspired restaurant, located in the Mission Pacific Hotel, earned one Michelin star in 2023.\nChef Roberto Alcocer (pictured) earned a Michelin star for Valle in Oceanside, Calif. (Credit: Valle) Alcocer has more than 25 years of experience in the culinary field across Mexico, France and Spain. According to the Valle website , the restaurant’s cuisine poses a “juxtaposition of modern Mexican dining against the carefree energy of Oceanside’s surf and skate community.”\nNominated for Best New Bar this year is Roma Norte, the only establishment from San Diego to be named in the category.\nRoma Norte was founded by Beau du Bois and Derek Cram, who also lead the cocktail programs at San Diego restaurants Puesto and Marisi.\n“With a slow and low approach to cocktail making, they blend artistry with accessibility, ensuring every drink is not just photo-worthy but something you’ll order again and again,” the Roma Norte website reads.\nFinal nominees for the James Beard Awards will be announced on April 2. The winners will be announced at a ceremony in Chicago on June 16.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.
