  "text": "Summary\n- A lucky PlayStation fan won a PS5 Pro from a $10 raffle ticket, saving hundreds.\n- PlayStation enjoyed a big year in 2024 with the PS5 Pro's launch and release of games like Astro Bot.\n- The PS5 Pro lacks a built-in disc tray, but offers hardware upgrades for improved gaming.\nA lucky PlayStation fan earned an impressive prize after buying a raffle ticket for just $10, which led to them winning a PlayStation 5 Pro console, earning them a new way to play games at an extremely low price. The system normally retails for just under $700 and, while it does not feature a disc tray, will give the fan access to a wide array of PlayStation console exclusives and its huge library of third-party games.\nPlayStation had a big year in 2024, with the PS5 Pro launching in November and the brand overall celebrating its 30th anniversary, which brought a slew of limited-edition merchandise and exclusive online store sales to honor the milestone. Alongside the celebration, Sony also enjoyed several massively successful game launches, with some even taking home accolades at The Game Awards, including Game of the Year winner Astro Bot.\nRelated\nPS5 Releases New Console Update for January 2025\nSony releases a brand-new PlayStation 5 system software update that is rolling out to users right now.\nReddit user Suspicious-Dress-767 shared an image of the PS5 Pro they reportedly won as a raffle prize for only $10 on the official PlayStation subreddit, expressing their gratitude toward the big win, given how expensive such a console usually is. While any model of PS5 would already be an expensive prize, the PS5 Pro comes with significant hardware upgrades intended to help with performance and graphical fidelity, making the win that much more valuable.\nPlayStation Fan's Lucky Raffle Win Leaves Other Fans Envious\nFans in the comments of the original post were seemingly envious of the user, expressing how lucky they felt the fan was for winning such an expensive gift for a price as low as $10, especially since they are likely not the only entrant. Some simply turned up to congratulate the user and even suggest some games to play on it, with one fan pointing out the unique upgrades made to God of War Ragnarok for the PS5 Pro.\nOf course, without a built-in disc drive, the library of games on the PS5 Pro by default is limited to the digital library available on the PlayStation Store, but there is an optional add-on that will add the feature at an extra cost. Either way, the PlayStation Store frequently undergoes digital store sales, bringing significant discounts to some of the biggest games on the platform, with current deals on first-party games like Gran Turismo 7 or The Last of Us Part 1.\nThis is far from the only time a PlayStation fan has gotten lucky and earned a brand-new console for little to no cost, as another fan received a PS5 console as a Christmas gift from their workplace. In any case, with the PlayStation brand continuing to evolve as time goes on and more major releases set to come in the near future, there is likely to be plenty to play for anyone who recently got their hands on the console.",
