  "text": "After a brutal start to the Big Ten schedule against #5 Minnesota and #1 Penn State, the 4th-ranked Huskers will make a weekend road trip through the Mitten State to face #16 Michigan and Michigan State.\nNebraska will take on the Wolverines Friday night at 6 p.m. (live on the B1G Network) before facing the Spartans Sunday at Noon (streaming on B1G+).\nfirst B1G road test\n— Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling)[pic.twitter.com/i2AoAeVGNz][January 21, 2025]\nAfter going 1-1 against two of the best teams in the conference, Nebraska comes in as a battle-tested unit and the heavy favorite in both duals this weekend. There are a few matchups where the Wolverines could be considered favorites, but the Spartans are likely outmatched at almost every weight if Nebraska uses its full starting lineup.\nAfter a brutal three-dual stretch to start the season — a 24-9 loss to #7 UNI, a 21-13 win over the Gophers, and a 31-7 loss at the hands of Penn State — Nebraska could be in the mood to rest some starters against some of these lesser opponents. I’ll mention below if there are any backups or freshmen that could make the trip and hit the mat.\nWeight-by-Weight Breakdown\nRankings according to FloWrestling\n125 pounds\nNebraska’s #7 Caleb Smith has had a really challenging season — his four losses have come to guys ranked #4, #5, #6 and #20. He owns wins this season over #8, #11 (twice), #12, #13 and #19.\nSay what you want, but Caleb Smith goes out there and scraps against anyone and everyone. He’s 12-4 this year and just went through a tough start to the calendar year. I would anticipate that Nebraska could kill two birds with one stone by allowing a freshman (or a couple) to fill in to give Smith a break against two opponents that are not currently ranked, granting those freshmen valuable experience in a dual on the road.\nBoth redshirt freshman Alan Koehler (12-5) and true freshman Kael Lauridsen (7-3) are options here. Still under a redshirt, Lauridsen can wrestle in two more “events” and keep it. Koehler is 1-1 this season in duals, while Lauridsen is 1-0. This starting spot will belong to one of these two guys next season.\nRegardless of who takes the mat, they’ll likely face Michigan’s Christian Tanefeu and Michigan State’s Caleb Weiand. Nebraska should be favored no matter which of the three goes out there.\nTanefeu is a junior who is 7-6 on the year but coming off a major-decision win against Maryland. He’s 10-17 for his career.\nWeiand is a redshirt freshman with a 9-6 record this year. He went 0-2 at Midlands and lost his only match against a ranked opponent by major decision.\n133 pounds\nAfter a rough start to the year, Nebraska’s #12 Jacob Van Dee has been on fire in January, picking up three ranked wins in a row — 5-0 over #21 Julian Farber of UNI, 5-1 over #13 Tyler Wells of Minnesota, and a 14-7 win over #7 Braeden Davis of Penn State. He’s now 8-5 on the year.\nNebraska could also use true freshman Omar Ayoub here. Ayoub, who is 4-1 on the season, was a Top-100 recruit coming out of high school as a two-time Ohio state champion.\nI kind of expect Van Dee to get both matches though because he’s young and just needs more matches to improve. He will likely see Michigan’s Nolan Wertanen and Michigan State’s Tristan Lujan this weekend.\nWertanen is 5-9 this year and has lost his last six matches. He took over after Michigan lost then-#4 Dylan Ragusin for the year due to injury earlier this season. Van Dee has two career wins over Ragusin, including a 10-4 decision this year at CKLV.\nLujan is a senior with a 47-47 career record. He’s 3-4 this season after qualifying for NCAAs last season.\nVan Dee by a mile in both matchups.\n141 pounds\nMuch like Van Dee, Nebraska’s #6 Brock Hardy has gone through an absolute gauntlet so far this January — a 7-5 loss to #5 Cael Happel of UNI, a 12-10 win over #8 Vance Vombaur of Minnesota, and an 8-7 loss to #3 Beau Bartlett of Penn State.\nAnother Husker veteran who could maybe use a break this weekend, Hardy will likely wrestle against Michigan but could take off the dual against the Spartans, letting junior Blake Cushing get in there.\nMichigan offers one of the weekend’s premier matchups with Hardy taking on #9 Sergio Lemley. A sophomore, Lemley is 12-4 this year, including a 4-2 loss to Vombaur last time out. Last season, Hardy and Lemly met three times with Hardy winning two of them.\nMichigan State will likely send out Jaden Crumpler, a redshirt freshman with a 4-9 record on the year. Against four ranked opponents this year, Crumpler is 0-4 and gave up bonus points in three of those matches.\n149 pounds\nComing off his huge win over then-#2 Shayne Van Ness of Penn State to be named the Big Ten Wrestler of the Week for the second time this season, Nebraska’s Ridge Lovett moved up from #5 in the country to #2. His only loss this year was a 6-3 loss in sudden victory to #1 Caleb Henson of Virginia Tech, the returning NCAA Champion.\nAnother week, another award.\n— Nebraska Wrestling (@HuskerWrestling)[@RidgeLovett]is your[@B1GWrestling]Wrestler of the Week for the second time this season.[#ToughTogether]|[#GBR][pic.twitter.com/u79UFjtSos][January 23, 2025]\nIt’s possible that Lovett gets a rest day, so redshirt freshman Scott Robertson could make the trip as well.\nMichigan will send out redshirt freshman #28 Dylan Gilcher, while the Spartans have Clayton Jones, also a redshirt freshman. Gilcher is 7-4 this year, while Jones is 3-7.\nLovett should mow through this weekend fairly easily.\nAs for a career statistic watch — Lovett currently has an 87-20 career record and needs 13 more wins to join the 100-win club at Nebraska. He’d be its 31st member.\n157 pounds\nNebraska’s #5 Antrell Taylor fell this past weekend to Penn State’s #3 Tyler Kasak, but he has a chance at redemption this weekend.\nAgainst the Wolverines, Taylor will face #16 Chase Saldate. Saldate pinned Taylor a few years ago when the young Husker was redshirting, but Taylor beat Saldate this year in Vegas 15-11. Saldate has lost three straight matches since CKLV, but it could still be another really entertaining match.\nThe Spartans have Braden Stauffenberg, a sophomore with a 3-10 record on the year. Taylor should make quick work of him.\n165 pounds\nNebraska’s #9 Bubba Wilson returned this past weekend and lost via tech fall to #1 Mitchell Mesenbrink of Penn State. He’ll have the chance this weekend to get back in the win column.\nWith redshirt freshman Chris Minto showing a lot of promise in his limited action this year (he beat then-#9 Andrew Sparks in a dual and was ranked #13 the following week), they could share the lineup this weekend.\nMichigan will send out redshirt freshman #18 Beau Mantanona, a top-shelf recruit a couple years ago. He’s 7-1 on the year with his only loss to #27 Noah Mulvaney of Bucknell. He’s come on recently with two ranked wins in a row over #19 Maxx Mayfield and #14 Sparks.\nFor Michigan State, DJ Shannon will take the mat. A senior, Shannon was an Illinois transfer who has a 24-39 career record. He’s 3-3 this year for the Spartans.\nThe Mantanona match will be tough for either Wilson or Minto, but the Michigan State matchup shouldn’t be too difficult.\n174 pounds\nWrestling here for Nebraska is #15 Lenny Pinto, a junior who is 13-4 this year. He started 2025 with a pair of ranked wins but fell this past weekend to #2 Levi Haines of Penn State. Pinto’s 7-2 decision loss is the first non-bonus win of the season for Haines.\nThis weekend, Pinto will likely take the mat for both duals — against Michigan’s Joseph Walker and Michigan State’s Ceasar Garza. Walker is a senior who is 8-4 on the year, while Garza is a sophomore with a 10-7 record this year.\nPinto is a big favorite in both of these matches.\nIf Pinto does rest, look out for true freshman (redshirting) LJ Araujo. The top recruit for Nebraska in 2024, Araujo looks to be the real deal in the practice room. He’s 10-4 on the year after taking some lumps early on, but he still has just one event left.\n184 pounds\nNebraska’s #7 Silas Allred has gone through a brutal stretch since the calendar turned over to 2025 — he’s lost three straight matches to #2 Parker Keckeisen (pin), #4 Max McEnelly (16-6 major) and #1 Carter Starocci (11-2 major).\nThings get much easier this weekend with Allred getting set to take on Michigan’s #17 Jaden Bullock and Michigan State’s Lucas Daly.\nBullock is 8-7 on the year, but he's wrestled some top guys very close — dropping a trio of 4-1 decisions to #4 McEnelly, #6 Bennett Berge and #10 Jaxon Smith.\nDaly is 9-8 this season but has been pinned by the two Top-10 opponents he’s faced.\nThis is the perfect weekend for Allred to bounce back and get into the win column again.\nNebraska could also bring redshirt freshman Ethan DeLeon for this weight. He’s 15-3 on the year with one dual loss against UNK and the rest in open tournaments.\n197 pounds\nWhere some of the guys have a manageable path this weekend, some just do not, and #26 Camden McDanel is an example of that. McDanel has lost his last three matches to really tough guys — #12 Wyatt Voelker (6-4 decision), #10 Isaiah Salazar (8-0 major) and #4 Josh Barr (19-4 tech).\nThings don’t get any easier this weekend with McDanel set to face #2 Jacob Cardenas of Michigan. After that, McDanel will take on Michigan State’s #23 Remy Cotton.\nCardenas is a two-time All-American who transferred this year from Cornell. He’s 11-0 on the year with his most recent 8-3 decision over Salazar his only non-bonus point victory. He's really good and in my opinion one of the few guys with a legitimate shot at making it to the NCAA final. It’s a tough matchup for the true freshman McDanel.\nCotton is no slouch either. A redshirt freshman, he’s 10-4 on the year and coming off a tech-fall win against Maryland. His losses haven’t been too bad either, so he’ll be a tough out.\nMcDanel will have his hands full this weekend, but I know he’s tough and will continue figuring things out as the season progresses.\n285 pounds\nSpeaking of tough schedules, Nebraska’s #22 Harley Andrews just wrestled both #1 Gable Steveson and #2 Greg Kerkvliet in back-to-back weekends. He lost both matches via tech fall, but he did show flashes and didn’t back down to either man.\nIn fact, he shot up the rankings a few spots this week after losing to Kerkvliet 20-2, possibly because he scored a reversal on the returning NCAA champion. They were the first offensive points Kerkvliet has given up all season.\nThis weekend, Andrews will take on Michigan’s #10 Josh Heindselman and #33 Max Vanadia of Michigan State. Heindselman is a four-time national qualifier for Oklahoma before transferring to Michigan for his final season. He’s 14-1 on the year with his only loss a pin at the hands of the Olympic Champion Steveson.\nVanadia is a redshirt freshman who is 10-11 on the year. He's 0-2 in Big Ten duals and was pinned by Kerkvliet in under a minute.\nStarting your Big Ten season 0-2 isn’t ideal, but I think Andrews deserves a pass based on his opponents. Now that he’s seen the best, maybe these other guys coming up won’t feel as tough for him. Look out for him to score some upsets before the postseason rolls around.",
