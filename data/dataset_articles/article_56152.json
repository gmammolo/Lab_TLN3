  "text": "Living\nWoman Takes Son Out Of School Early To ‘Make Memories’ With Dying Dog\nA woman was determined to give her kids one last special day with their beloved family dog, even if it meant cutting school short for the day.\nTo some, dogs are more than simply pets; they're family. It therefore follows that the death of a canine companion can sometimes feel like the loss of a family member.\nA 2015 study published in the journal Anthrozoos concluded that human grief following the death of a pet often depends on the \"level of attachment\" and the bonds formed.\nGiven that dogs live longer, require more human interaction and even share some basic human characteristics, it's perhaps logical that the death of a canine would hit hard.\nThe death of Buddy, Natasha Hopper's 11-year-old dog hit her family hard. \"I got him when he was 8 weeks old around Valentine's Day,\" Hopper told Newsweek. \"He loved going to the field and being able to chase the birds and even the footballs when kids were playing. He also loved getting toys and it being his mission to get the squeak out of it.\"\nHopper, who is from Kent in the U.K., shared a special bond with Buddy. \"He'd lay at the end of my bed but he'd come and bury himself under the covers through the night,\" she said.\nIt was a similar story with her children. Some dogs have been known to express unhappiness or jealousy following the arrival of a baby on the scene. Buddy was different though.\n\"When the kids were babies he'd be by their side throughout the day, I've got a picture of him and my son where Buddy's on the changing mat and my son was next to it where he had rolled off.\"\nBuddy seemed to instinctively know how to behave around Hopper's kids. \"My son's autistic and whenever he was having a meltdown he would be by his side,\" Hopper said. \"As my daughter got older he'd sit next to her when playing dress up and always let her put headbands on him.\"\nFor over a decade, Buddy was a beloved part of the family, but over Christmas, Hopper noticed he kept getting sick and was off his food. Hopper took him to the vet where he underwent blood tests. A few days later, an ultrasound confirmed her worst fears: Buddy had cancer.\nA large tumor was found on his spleen. The veterinarians told Hopper they could operate and remove the tumor but the blood test results suggested it was \"likely to already be elsewhere\" and, given his age, the surgery would likely only delay the inevitable.\nHopper and her vet came to an agreement that saw Buddy prescribed a week's worth of pain medication and steroids, at the end of which he would be put to sleep. That time would give Hopper and her family a chance to say goodbye to the dog who had meant so much to all of them. She was determined to make the most of it.\n\"I decided to go collect my eldest son from school early,\" Hopper said. \"We took Buddy to McDonald's so he could have a burger and all went down to the beach, he slept in the car all the way home and he had all his favourite treats and cuddles back at home.\"\nHopper shared some highlights from their day in a video posted to her TikTok @tashalouise_95 showing their efforts to \"make memories\" with their beloved dog.\nHopper was appreciative of her son's school for allowing him this time. They understood that dogs like Buddy are more than pets. \"His school was brilliant and couldn't have been better with the support they gave,\" Hopper said.\nThe next morning, Hopper took Buddy to the vet. \"It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make but the right one for him,\" she said. The family has been in mourning ever since.\n\"My son has been very emotional and struggling to come to terms with it,\" Hopper said. \"My daughter is too young to fully understand, she still believes he's coming home.\"\nThough it will take time for them, Hopper has no regrets about being honest with her kids about the situation. More than anything else, she's just happy that they got to spend one final day together as a family.\n\"It meant the world,\" she said. \"Being on the beach and Buddy running between the children and myself showing his true protector self, I know he'll forever be by our side and my children will forever talk about that day.\"\nRelated Articles\n2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC.\nThis story was originally published January 23, 2025 at 3:11 PM.",
