  "text": "Living\nOwner Runs to Help After Dog Goes Potty in -30 Degrees-’Can’t Make It Back’\nA home security camera captured an owner's response to rescue her dog in below-freezing temperatures, and viewers are impressed with her quickness.\nIn a TikTok posted to the account @ellysamw earlier this week, a home security camera filmed a dog who started making his way back inside the house. The path he walked on looked to have been used constantly. He knew the routine: get out, do business, get back inside. However, he stopped short of the door after his doggy sibling interrupted him.\nThe interference caused him to freeze in place. Because it was -30 degrees Celsius (-22 Fahrenheit), he needed assistance, and within seconds, the owner ran outside. The text on the video explained that when it is that cold, \"the pups sometimes can't make it back inside,\" which is why she is always on standby.\nShe informed viewers in the caption that she monitors her dogs to \"make sure they can get back to the door,\" and if they freeze, as her canine did in the video, she's prepared to pick them up and bring them inside.\nThe owner shared in a comment that this dog in particular is the \"toughest of the three,\" but the -30 degrees got to him that morning.\nViewer Reactions\nThe video quickly amassed 1.8 million views, 87,200 likes and 616 comments as of Thursday. Most people applauded the owner's quick response, while others scorned her for letting her dogs outside without winter protection.\n\"Momma was there so quick!\" said a viewer, and a second person echoed: \"The fact he had to wait 3 seconds for you proves you're a great dog mom.\"\nAnother added: \"Awe, I don't blame him the cold sucks!!\"\nThose who disapproved asked why she didn't put on a coat or have them wear gloves on their paws, which she addressed in a video posted on Tuesday.\nThat clip showed her dogs sprinting around the yard playing with each other in the snow. She said this is how her dogs act \"99 percent\" of the time in winter. She doesn't think it is necessary to clothe her dogs for a potty break because they have fur and finish quickly.\n\"...sometimes they just get too far before realizing they are cold and I'll help them whenever needed,\" part of the caption reads.\nOtherwise, she said if she walks them in cold weather, she makes them wear doggy boots.\nNewsweek reached out to @ellysamw via TikTok for additional information.\nRelated Articles\n2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC.\nThis story was originally published January 23, 2025 at 3:09 PM.",
