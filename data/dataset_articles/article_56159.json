  "text": "Injuries to big-name players crushed the hopes and dreams of many MLB franchises in 2024. Yet, it was the injury-ravaged Los Angeles Dodgers that managed to win it all last season.\nCruel irony aside, many notable players who sat out in 2024 are expected back for 2025. Here are 10 who fans may have forgotten about.\n1. SP Lucas Giolito, Boston Red Sox\n2023 stats: 33 starts, 184.1 innings pitched, 4.88 ERA\nSigned to a two-year contract ahead of last season, Giolito tore his ulnar collateral ligament in his first spring training outing with the Boston Red Sox in March 2024, necessitating Tommy John surgery. He's expected back at spring training this season, however, and hopes to stay healthy this time around as part of a revamped pitching rotation in Boston.\n2. RP Liam Hendriks, Boston Red Sox\n2023 stats: Five games, five innings pitched, 5.40 ERA\nStaying with the Red Sox, reliever Hendriks is expected back for the 2025 season after missing last year while rehabbing from Tommy John surgery. Hendriks is also a cancer survivor and was named the 2023 AL Comeback Player of the Year for his triumphant recovery.\n3. SP Kyle Wright, Kansas City Royals\n2023 stats: Seven starts, 31 innings pitched, 6.97 ERA\nOnce a top pitching prospect with the Atlanta Braves, Wright was traded to the Kansas City Royals in November 2023. He missed all of 2024 after undergoing a procedure to repair a torn shoulder capsule, but he is on track to return in 2025 after the Royals reinstated him from the 60-day injured list in December.\n4. SP Dustin May, Los Angeles Dodgers\n2023 stats: Nine starts, 48 innings pitched, 2.63 ERA\nSensing a theme here? May missed most of the 2023 season after having Tommy John surgery, but had a chance to a return in 2024 before tearing his esophagus. Fortunately, he's gearing up to join the World Champions in 2025.\n5. SP Sandy Alcantara, Miami Marlins\n2023 stats: 28 starts, 184.2 innings pitched, 4.14 ERA\nAlcantara is the Marlins' ace and one of the most dominant pitchers in the sport when healthy. But just like others on this list, he went under the knife following his last appearance in 2023, resulting in a missed 2024 campaign. He looks to return early in 2025.\n6. SS Ronny Mauricio, New York Mets\n2023 stats: 101 at-bats, .248/.296/.347, two home runs\nMauricio debuted with the Mets in September 2023, but his first stint in Queens was cut short by a torn ACL, which the promising shortstop is still rehabbing as of early 2025. He isn't likely to be ready for spring training, but he is expected back sometime this season.\n7. OF Jasson Dominguez, New York Yankees\n2024 stats: 56 at-bats, .179/.313/.304, two home runs\nDominguez played briefly in 2024, but that could be forgotten between Tommy John surgery in September 2023 and an oblique injury suffered in 2024. He never made it back after that, but Yankees general manager Brian Cashman wants the touted prospect to \"get his shot\" in 2025.\n8. C Endy Rodriguez, Pittsburgh Pirates\n2023 stats: 186 at-bats, .220/.284/.328, three home runs\nRodriguez, a top prospect in the Pirates' organization, debuted in 2023 before succumbing to elbow surgery in 2024. He is on track for 2025, but given Pittsburgh's catching depth, he could find himself playing some first base.\n9. SP Shane McClanahan, Tampa Bay Rays\n2023 stats: 21 starts, 115 innings pitched, 3.29 ERA\nMcClanahan is the Rays' ace, but he had Tommy John surgery in August 2023, forcing him to miss all of 2024. However, Tampa Bay now expects the southpaw to toss \"150-ish\" innings in 2025.\n10. RP Felix Bautista, Baltimore Orioles\n2023 stats: 56 games, 33 saves, 1.48 ERA\nThe Orioles missed closer Bautista in 2024 after the he needed elbow surgery in August 2023. The dominant closer is rumored to be healthy heading into 2025, per manager Brandon Hyde, which is great news for Baltimore.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
