  "text": "Kang SeolMin, a prominent trot singer, recently shared her challenges in the MBN documentary ‘Exclusive World,’ which aired on January 23. Known for her vibrant performances, Kang was the runner-up in the popular competition ‘Hello Trot’ from 2021 to 2022. Despite her fame, being a trot singer poses significant challenges.\nTo support herself, Kang has worked at an electronic waste collection company for the past year. She often wears worn work clothes, highlighting her struggles. In a conversation with fellow trot singer Yong-ho, she mentioned that the beginning of the year, especially January and February, is a slow period for events in the industry. This seasonal lull emphasizes the financial uncertainty that many artists face.\nReflecting on her journey since her runner-up finish, Kang acknowledged that while ‘Hello Trot’ helped her build her singing career, it did not drastically improve her living conditions. Currently, she rents a small room for about 300,000 won (approximately $250) per month. Living modestly, she often eats minimal food and wears clothing borrowed from other artists, showcasing the challenges performers often encounter.\nKang also shared that her living space lacks basic amenities, such as a full-length mirror. This forces her to squat to choose her outfits. Despite these difficulties, she was excited to finally land an event gig after a long dry spell. To save money, she did her own makeup and used a borrowed small car to reach the venue.\nUpon arrival, Kang faced another challenge: changing clothes in the parking lot due to the absence of a waiting room for emerging artists. This experience illustrates the often-overlooked hardships faced by aspiring performers in the entertainment industry. The glitz and glamour can mask a grueling reality.\nKang SeolMin’s story serves as a poignant reminder of the resilience required to pursue a career in the arts. Her journey reflects the continual struggle for recognition and stability amidst the challenges of the music business. Additionally, reality TV competitions like ‘Hello Trot’ can significantly impact artists’ careers, but they also come with their own set of challenges.\nAs Kang continues her journey, she hopes for better support systems for struggling musicians in the industry. Her experiences highlight the need for greater awareness of the realities that many artists face today. Through her story, we understand the importance of resilience in the face of adversity.",
