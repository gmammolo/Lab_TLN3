  "text": "Upgrading to a big-screen TV for gaming can be a hassle, especially when the average retail price is above $700. Fortunately, a limited-time deal on the 75-inch Samsung DU6950 has made this smart TV more affordable than it's ever been. For those keen on getting a new TV, the Samsung TV now costs $530 instead of $750. This means gamers can save a whopping $220 on this purchase if they act quickly.\nRelated\nBest Budget 4K TVs in 2024\nExplore high-definition without breaking the bank with our buying guide to the best budget 4K TVs.\nSamsung's lineup of TVs is well-known for their superior build quality and vibrant colors. What's more, the brand caters to various categories of buyers by offering premium models like the OLED TVs and budget-friendly models like the LED TVs. Regardless of whichever model a buyer goes for, Samsung TVs stand out in terms of picture quality, connectivity options, and video upscaling.\nBig-Screen Gaming At A Reasonable Price\nAs advertised, the Samsung DU6950 offers a massive 75-inch screen which is ideal for large living rooms. Nothing screams immersion more than a big-screen TV paired with a powerful gaming console such as the PS5 or Xbox Series X. Imagine the thrill of taking on the overpowered bosses in Black Myth: Wukong or attempting to survive in the ruthless Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2: Heart of Chornobyl on a large TV screen.\nThe DU6950 also sports a 4K resolution, which means on-screen content looks incredibly realistic. For those upgrading from a 1080p TV, the visual upgrade is tremendous and is worth the purchase. What if you're streaming a show that was originally shot in a lower resolution? Viewers won't have to deal with blurry images on the Samsung TV as its Crystal Processor 4K can upscale 720p and 1080p content to a near-4K level.\nRelated\nThe Best Budget Smart TVs in 2024\nSmart TVs are no longer reserved for the elite. Budget shoppers have more choices than ever when it comes to affordable, top of the line smart TVs.\nTVs with excellent motion handling are the top choice for gamers, especially those who play competitive titles such as Marvel Rivals and Apex Legends. Although the DU6950 is capped at a 60 Hz refresh rate, it comes with Motion Xcelerator. Motion Xcelerator is an exclusive Samsung TV feature that lowers the chances of motion blur by enhancing the motion in between frames. Essentially, it makes fast-paced moments in movies and sports games look less blurry.\nWhen you aren't gaming, there are tons of streaming platforms to discover on Samsung TV OS. From Netflix Originals to HBO’s docuseries, there's always one intriguing show or movie to watch. Like other smart TVs, surfing the internet, downloading apps, and updating installed apps is possible from the comfort of your couch.\n75-inch Samsung DU6950 TV\nThe 75-inch Samsung DU5950 is a terrific 4K TV that delivers a big-screen TV experience for gaming and streaming. Aside from its 4K native resolution, the TV's Crystal Processor 4K can upscale content shot in lower resolutions, thereby allowing you to enjoy classics with better details. The TV also has Motion Xcelerator, a feature that improves the motion in between frames, ensuring that fast-paced content is rendered with minimal blur.\nAlthough the TV's audio quality is pretty good, those seeking cinematic-grade entertainment can take things up a notch by pairing a soundbar with the DU6950. Connecting the TV with either a Samsung Q Series or S series soundbar will fill the living room with immersive audio. Whether you're making your way through the story campaign of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 or streaming Yellowstone, expect a richer sound quality from the TV.\nThe Samsung DU6950 is an excellent big-screen TV for console gaming, and it's a great value-for-money product. Act quickly while it's $220 off at Best Buy to level up your gaming experience today.\nMore\nBest TVs for Movies in 2024\nFrom blockbuster hits to indie gems, find the best TV for your home cinema in our latest expert guide.",
