  "text": "Turning a lifelong hobby into a successful business is a dream for most people, and local baker Emily Posey made it her own dream come true.\nPosey, who has enjoyed baking since she was a child, now operates her own sourdough microbakery. Every week, she sells an array of carefully crafted sourdough baked goods from a shed — known as The Bread Shed — that sits just outside her Bristow home.\n“There is something great about turning simple ingredients into a delicious thing,” Posey said. “I wanted fresh bread to be a core memory for my son, baking and enjoying it together. That’s why I started perfecting it professionally. That’s why it has been so special for me to turn my baking into a business. My son is now really proud of what I’ve done.”\nBusiness took off for Posey when she moved to her new neighborhood last year and word began to spread.\n“I started to share loaves with neighbors, and I realized there was a demand in my community for fresh artisan bread,” she said. “Then, in the late summer last year, we built the shed, which I stock every week.”\nIt’s more than just a catchy name that keeps her customers returning to The Bread Shed. Posey caters to her clientele, baking just about anything that can come with a sourdough base.\n“I plan a lot based on what people recommend for me, which is why I take suggestions in The Bread Shed,” she said. “If something is popular, I’ll increase production. I feed off what the community is telling me and what they like. What always goes fast are my classic loaves, cinnamon rolls, and brown butter chocolate chip cookies.”\nClosing in on the list of most in-demand items are brownies and focaccia bread, she added.\nPosey — a one-woman show — has the entire business down to a science.\n“In the days leading up to stocking, I post on my Facebook page what’s going to be available, and on what days,” Posey said. “As I walk out with a cart, people are waiting.”\nIt was early in her bread-making journey that Posey homed in on making sourdough.\n“Sourdough is really interesting with its natural fermentation process,” she said. “It uses a natural starter — wild yeast instead of commercial yeast. It has a really good, tangy, sour flavor, and it doesn’t contain preservatives or added sugars, making it a more wholesome bread option for a lot of people.”\nFor Posey, giving life to the Bread Shed has been about infusing more wellness into her community. Unlike so many business owners who hope to expand their home-based business to storefront operations, Posey aims to keep things relatively simple.\n“I like being small-scale and out of a home because it allows me to focus on quality over quantity,” she said.\nFor more information, follow Carb Perfection Sourdough Microbakery on Facebook and Instagram.
