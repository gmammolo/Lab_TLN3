  "text": "A pro-democracy activist who fled China after documenting what he described as concentration camps in Xinjiang was granted asylum on Jan. 28 by a New York immigration judge, amid widespread concern about the risks he would face if deported.\nGuan Heng, 38, applied for asylum after arriving in the United States illegally in 2021. He was living in New York state before he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in August 2025.\nlawmakersin two dozen countries, including the United States, urging the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to abandon its plan to deport him to Uganda. The agency subsequently\ncanceledthe plan.\nDuring Wednesday’s hearing in Napanoch, New York, Judge Charles Ouslander said Guan had a “well-founded fear” of persecution if he were sent back to China because of his video in Xinjiang.\nGuan was asked whether he filmed the detention camps and released the video shortly before arriving in the United States to support his asylum case. He said that was not his intent.\n“I sympathized with the Uyghurs who were persecuted,” Guan, speaking by video link from the Broome County Correctional Facility in New York, told the court through a translator.\ndetailsGuan’s journey from China to the United States. In 2020, he read a BuzzFeed News report on detention centers in Xinjiang and decided to verify it, it said.\nreleasedmost of his video footage on YouTube in October 2021, the same month he arrived in Florida by boat after sailing from the Bahamas, where he had arrived from Ecuador after fleeing China, according to the advocacy group.\nHRIC characterized Guan’s video footage as an “extremely rare, first-person, on-the-ground video from a Chinese citizen.”\nA month after Guan released his video, Chinese authorities, led by state security officials, began systematically targeting Guan’s relatives in China in what HRIC called “collective punishment.”\nGuan told the judge that Chinese police had questioned his father three times since he released the video.\nGuan’s attorney, Chen Chuangchuang, argued in his closing statement that his client’s case represents a “textbook example of why asylum should exist,” adding that the United States has both a “moral and legal responsibility” to grant Guan asylum.\nIn December, before the DHS shelved its plan to deport Guan to Uganda, Chen spoke to The Epoch Times’ sister media outlet NTD about how the Ugandan government “has a troubling record of cooperating with the Chinese Communist Party in making arrests in Uganda.”\n“Sending a well-known dissident like Mr. Guan to Uganda would be unsafe,” Chen told NTD in, according to a translation of his remarks in Chinese.\nThe judge said in his ruling that Guan had proven his legal eligibility for asylum, describing him as a credible witness. He added that Guan faced a real risk of retaliation if returned to China, noting that Chinese authorities had questioned his family members and asked about his whereabouts and prior activities.\nGuan was not released immediately, as a DHS lawyer said the agency reserves the right to appeal within 30 days. The judge urged the department to make a swift decision, noting that Guan has been detained for about five months.\nRights groups and activists have welcomed the judge’s decision.\nstatement.\n“His footage of Uyghur concentration camps was invaluable to journalism that helped expose the horrors in Xinjiang, a region where the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has committed crimes against humanity and genocide, according to the US State Department.
