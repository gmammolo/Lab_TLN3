  "text": "Photo: Marianna Massey/DigitalVision/Getty Images\nChain restaurants and popular eateries are great, but there's something about sitting down at a locally famous hole-in-the-wall or a longtime favorite mom and pop shop that has been serving up tried and true delicious meals for years that just hits home.\nUsing reviews, awards and accolades as well as first-hand experience, LoveFood compiled a list of the \"best mom and pop restaurant\" in every state, eateries that have been a mainstay of the community for decades or establishments that serve up family recipes that have been perfected over several generations.\nAccording to the site, the best mom and pop restaurant in all of North Carolina is Bum's Restaurant, an eatery in Ayden that serves standout dishes like barbecue classics and fried chicken. Bum's Restaurant , located at 566 E 3rd Street, has a 4.4 star rating on Google and nearly 500 reviews.\nHere's what the site had to say about this restaurant offering \"incredible comfort food\":\n\"There's a lot of competition when it comes to barbecue in North Carolina, but this family-owned spot earns plaudits for its delectably meaty mains, friendly vibe, and wallet-friendly prices. There's much praise for the classic barbecue plates, which are piled high with meats like slow-cooked pulled pork, plus trimmings — think collard greens and mac 'n' cheese.\" Check out the full list at lovefood.com to read up on more of the best mom and pop restaurants in the country.",
