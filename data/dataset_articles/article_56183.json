  "text": "Summary\n- The PS5 Collector's Edition for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 costs $149.99 and includes exclusive physical and digital content.\n- Xbox and PC players can access the game on day one with Game Pass, but the PS5 special edition offers more for hardcore RPG fans.\n- The standard edition is $49.99, offering a cheaper price option.\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 developer Sandfall Interactive has recently unveiled the PS5’s Collector's Edition for the game, which will cost $149.99 and come with several goodies. Xbox and PC players can play Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 on day one by using a Game Pass subscription, but this special edition could be perfect for hardcore RPG fans who own a PlayStation 5.\nDeveloped by the Montpellier-based Sandfall Interactive studio, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a turn-based RPG with action elements that was first announced during the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024. After the first trailer, the game was showcased again in the recent Xbox Developer Direct, which happened on January 23.\nRelated\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33’s Voice Cast Explained\nThe voice cast of Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been officially announced, and includes some surprise powerhouse performers.\nSoon after the event, Sandfall Interactive unveiled Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - Collector’s Edition, which will be available for PlayStation 5. The Collector’s Edition can already be pre-ordered on GameStop, costs $149.99, and will be available for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s launch on April 24. Aside from a physical PS5 edition of the game, the special edition will come with several goodies, including a 20.3 centimeter hand-painted monolith music box statuette made out of resin, a Steelbook featuring Gustave, Maelle, and the Paintress, and a 48-page Expeditioner’s Journal with the game’s art. Gamers who purchase the product will also get some exclusive digital content: six outfits and hairstyles inspired by the Flowers of Lumiere, six “Gommage” outfit variations, and two “Clair Obscur” outfits.\nWhat's Included in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - Collector's Edition?\n- Physical PS5 version of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33\n- 20.3cm Monolith Music Box\n- Steelbook featuring Gustave, Maelle, and the Paintress.\n- 48-page hardcover artbook (The Expeditioner's Journal)\n- Digital content, including six new outfits and hairstyles, six \"Goomage\" outfit variations, and 2 \"Clair Obscur\" outfits.\nGamers who are not interested in this collector’s edition can purchase the standard edition of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 for only $49.99. Last year, Clair Obscur’s developers revealed that the game’s price would be cheaper than most big-budget RPGs for two main reasons: Sandfall Interactive is not a AAA studio and to attract a larger audience.\nFrom what was shown so far, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 could be among the best turn-based RPGs released recently. According to previous reports from the developers, each character in the party will have unique abilities, and series such as Final Fantasy and Persona were the main inspirations while designing the game’s combat. The story of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 will be focused on four people who mount an expedition to face the Paintress, a mythical figure who holds power over death, and save their hometown. With a compelling story, slick gameplay, and beautiful graphics inspired by the French Belle Époque, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 might be a pretty good pick for fans of the genre.\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a ground-breaking turn-based RPG with unique real-time mechanics, making battles more immersive and addictive than ever. Explore a fantasy world inspired by Belle Époque France in which you battle devastating enemies.\nIn this evolution of JRPGs, real-time actions enhance the heart of turn-based combat. Craft unique builds for your Expeditioners that fit your playstyle via gear, stats, skills, and character synergies. Open an active dimension in combat - dodge, parry, and counter in real time, chain combos by mastering attack rhythms, and target enemy weak points using a free aim system.\nWith only one year left to live, join Gustave, Maelle, and their fellow Expeditioners as they embark upon a desperate quest to break the Paintress’ cycle of death. Follow the trail of previous expeditions and discover their fate. Get to know the members of Expedition 33 as they learn to work together against impossible odds.\nExplore an enchanting realm populated by surreal adversaries. Wander through breathtaking landscapes, from the Island of Visages to the Forgotten Battlefield, discovering secrets and hidden quests along the way. Find allies of fortune in creatures of legend and recruit special companions, access new travel methods and discover secret areas in the World Map.\n- Platform(s)\n-\nPC,PlayStation 5,Xbox Series X,Xbox Series S - Developer(s)\n- Sandfall Interactive\n- Publisher(s)\n- Kepler Interactive\n- Engine\n- Unreal Engine 5",
