Our mission is simple — delight our guests with exceptional food and service, and create lasting connections with the community. We can’t wait to see Pearland embrace what we love so much about this brand.”\nThe Pearland café opening is a milestone for the brand, and the 13th in the state of Texas. As their growth continues, Paris Baguette is looking to reach the 1,000-unit mark in the U.S. & Canada by 2030 and working to expand through meaningful partnerships with local entrepreneurs who show a genuine interest in uniting their neighbors through connections over fresh baked goods and artisan coffee beverages.\n“We’re on a mission to re-establish the neighborhood bakery café as the heart of the community across the U.S., and we’re excited to see JW Concept bring this to life in their local trade area,” said Darren Tipton , Chief Executive Officer of Paris Baguette. “In our cafes we like to say, ‘Happy to see you. Happier to serve you.’ And we know JW Concept will wholeheartedly embrace this approach in their neighborhood.”\nWith a projected 1,000 bakery cafés in the United States by 2030, Paris Baguette is on a mission to reestablish the neighborhood bakery café as the heart of the community. Paris Baguette serves craveable baked and brewed treats and creates warm and welcoming experiences through a blend of gracious service, expert craftsmanship and community connections. From decisions made behind a desk to smiles offered behind a counter, the desire to spread joy and make the world a happier place drives everything we do.
