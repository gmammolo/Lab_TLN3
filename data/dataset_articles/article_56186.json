  "text": "Best Colorado Mom-and-Pop Restaurants Named for 2025\nI love finding a fantastic mom-and-pop restaurant. There are plenty of them to choose from in\nColorado. I love mom-and-pop's because I instantly feel comfortable and the food makes me feel like I am in on a family secret recipe.\nLove Food put out a list of the best mom-and-pop restaurants across the country. Their list focuses on a comfortable environment that pairs well with comfortable food.\nPenrose Restaurant Mentioned on Top List\nLove Food nominated two mom-and-pop restaurants in our state. This is especially nice considering most other states on the list only have one restaurant mentioned.\nThe first restaurant Love Food mentioned was Coyote's Coffee Den in Penrose. The website raved about the location and how it provides an amazing view.\nAdditionally, Love Food mentions that the giant turkey melt sandwiches and taco salads are favorites amongst residents.\nLove Food also gave a shoutout to the owners Rhea and Pete. This mom-and-pop restaurant seems amazing and I am looking forward to making a trip soon.\n- Coyote's Coffee Den Address:\n675 CO-115, Penrose, CO 81240\n- You can check out their menu here:\ncoyotescoffeeden.com\nDenver Restaurant Was Also Highlighted\nLove Food also mentioned Cozy Cottage in Denver. This family-owned restaurant was praised and called down-to-earth.\nTheir patio was a highlight, and their friendly staff and country-fried steaks were Love Food's menu item of choice. Their carnitas are highly acclaimed as well.\nRelated |\n3 GREAT COLORADO RESTAURANTS LISTED AMONG TOP 50 BEST\nI have not been to this restaurant yet either. I will gladly add it to my restaurant's bucket list.\n- Cozy Cottages Address:\n4363 Tennyson St, Denver, CO 80212\n- Check out their menu here:\ncozyupdenver.com\nIf you would like to see the full list of the best mom-and-pop restaurants across the country you can do so below.\n😋\nCheck Out Nation's Best Mom-and-Pop Restaurants from Love Food 🍴\nThe 10 Oldest Restaurants in Colorado\nGallery Credit: Kelsey Nistel\nTop 5 Pizza Places Voted by Fort Collins Residents\nvoiced their opinionon which pizza spot is the best in Fort Collins.
