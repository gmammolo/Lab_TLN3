  "text": "My debut essay collection was published by Penguin Random House last June. After a lifetime of dreaming of having a book with my name on it in Barnes and Noble, it finally happened. I spent the summer buying local bookstore copies (my irrational and expensive way of making them purchase more to restock) and being completely dumbfounded that my forever dream had come true. A book I wrote about growing up as a 1980s baby turned 1990s kid, had been purchased by my dream publisher; mass-produced, and sold across the country.\nMy friends and family congratulated me accordingly. I was wined, dined, and toasted to my vain little heart’s content. It was a season of triumph, sheer disbelief, and more excitement than I can describe.",
