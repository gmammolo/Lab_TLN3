  "text": "By Jarek Rutz ,\n37 minutes ago Chef Antimo DiMeo was also named a semifinalist for the award in 2022. (All photos by Neal Santos)\nAntimo DiMeo, the executive chef for Bardea Food & Drink on Wilmington’s Market Street, has been named a semifinalist for being one of the nation’s top chefs.\nHe’s the only Delaware semifinalist this year for the prestigious James Beard Award , a recognition started in 1990 to honor leaders in the culinary and food media industries, and those in the broader food systems.\nScott Stein\n“I’m so honored to receive this nomination,” Chef DiMeo said. “Seeing my name among such talented chefs was an indescribable feeling. I was in shock. I’m so proud of my team. This is a result of our hard work and dedication.”\nDiMeo is a semifinalist for the “Best Chef: Mid-Atlantic” category, which includes the cream of the crop from the First State, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.\nHe was previously a semifinalist in the same category in 2022.\n“This means the world to us,” Bardea Co-founder Scott Stein said. “We couldn’t be prouder of Antimo and the entire kitchen team. Yesterday was filled with tears of joy and excitement.”\nAll the hard work has truly paid off, proving that staying focused and persevering leads to great things, Stein said.",
