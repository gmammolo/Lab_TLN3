A favorite activity is celebrating the birthdays of the girls who reside there. Members of the league gather to honor these special occasions, bringing joy, laughter and meaningful connections to the girls.\nIn addition to offering their time, the league supports the ranch through financial contributions, helping to enrich the lives of these young women.",
