  "text": "By Matt Young ,\n2 hours ago Jalen Green and Draya Michele at David Yurman Men's x NBA Launch Event held at the Hollywood Athletic Club on July 9, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. (Michael Buckner/Variety via Getty Images) Jalen Green and Draya Michele keep things private about their relationship, but the Houston Rockets star posted a message of love on Instagram for his girlfriend’s 40th birthday Thursday.\n“Happy Pday to the realest on my side. I love you @drayamichele,” Green wrote on his Instagram story along with a photo of the two embracing.\nGreen and Draya have nearly 12 million Instagram followers combined — more than 9 million of that belongs to Draya — but they rarely post about each other on social media.\nThe couple was first spotted together in the summer of 2023 and they had a daughter in May. Draya often sits courtside at Rockets home games.\nDraya rose to fame as a castmember on VH1's reality series Basketball Wives LA, appearing in four seasons beginning in 2011. The actress also has been cast in a variety of TV shows and movies. She owns multiple fashion lines, including the successful swimwear brand Mint Swim .\nGreen, who also has a birthday coming up when he’ll turn 23 in February, is experiencing the best season of his career after being drafted No. 2 overall by the Rockets in 2021. The shooting guard is making a case for his first All-Star selection , leading the Rockets in scoring at 21.3 points per game, while shooting a career-best 36% from the 3-point line.",
