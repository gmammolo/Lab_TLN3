  "text": "By Chiara Fiorillo ,\n17 minutes ago Kanye West said he has been \"training\" his daughter North West after announcing he is launching a new clothing brand .\nThe 47-year-old rapper shared a video of himself and his 11-year-old daughter in a recording studio, with the caption \"TRAINING 3.\" Earlier this week, he had posted two more clips of North practicing her music skills with the help of her father and his team.\nIn the latest clip, Ye can be seen giving North some tips on how to sing some tunes and making her repeat some verses until she gets them perfectly. The young artist smiles and looks at her father as he teaches her some tricks of the trade.\nREAD MORE: Kanye West teams up with daughter North after being branded an 'absent father'\nREAD MORE: Kanye West goes head-to-head with Kim Kardashian as he launches brand inspired by Bianca Censori\nFans were excited to see the video on Ye's Instagram profile, as one wrote, \"She's literally learning from the greatest artist of all time,\" before adding, \"Her first album is about to be amazing.\" Another said, \"Thank you North for giving Kanye back to us.\"\nA third commented, \"YE your father and your music teacher.

No corporations leveraging my platform Using me to get to get to us Overcharging our community while ignoring my vision and direction.\"\nYe continued, \"Stopping the foam runners and Yeezy slides production during COVID only to copy the designs. People tried to tell me to go back to adidas. Of course they were people close enough to ask for money from me. They didn't care about my freedom or vision.
