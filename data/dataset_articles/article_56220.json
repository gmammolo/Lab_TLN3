  "text": "Read full article USA TODAY 'Lost' Tina Turner track to be released 2 years after queen of rock 'n' roll's death Amaris Encinas, USA TODAY January 24, 2025 at 12:14 a.m. · 2 min read\nLink Copied\nTina Turner performs at Macy's Passport fundraiser and fashion show on Sept. 18, 1997, in San Francisco, California. A new, rediscovered track from the late Tina Turner has made its public debut.\n\"Hot For You Baby,\" a previously unheard and unreleased song from the R&B and soul singer-turned rock star's vault, along with an array of other never-before-released tracks, live performances, and footage will appear on the 40th Anniversary Edition of \"Private Dancer,\" Turner's fifth studio album.\nThe track \"was thought to be lost to time, but this thrilling discovery introduces a fresh chapter in the 'Private Dancer' story,\" according to a Thursday announcement from Parlophone Records.\n\"Hot For You Baby\" was recorded and was initially set to appear on the 1984 record. That album, \"Private Dancer,\" marked Turner's mid-career comeback after she fled an abusive relationship with her musical mentor and first husband, Ike Turner.\nADVERTISEMENT The May 1984 album was recorded in two weeks and went on to become a huge commercial success despite her label's reluctancy to promote her music. “What’s Love Got to Do With It,\" a track from \"Private Dancer\" was Turner's only No. 1 single.\nThat song earned a record of the year Grammy Award and Turner the status of being the (then) oldest woman to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 chart .\nThe re-release of \"Private Dancer,\" due March 21, comes nearly two years after Turner's death.\nTina Turner's 'Hot For You Baby:' Listen below \"Hot For You Baby\" made its on-air debut Thursday on BBC's Radio 2 Breakfast Show at 8:50 a.m. local time. The track, according to BBC is a \" prime example of Turner's raspy, physical style of soul.\"\nThe song had previously been recorded and released by Australian singer John Paul Young (the voice behind disco classic \"Love Is In The Air'), but his version of the song wasn't a hit, per BBC.\nADVERTISEMENT The 40th Anniversary Edition of \"Private Dancer\" will be available in multiple configurations: a 5-CD/Blu-ray set, 2-CD, a 1-LP Pearl vinyl, and a 1-LP picture disc (all available for pre-order here ).\nThe 5-CD/Blu-ray set will feature live performances from a two-night stint at NEC Birmingham, where David Bowie and Bryan Adams performed with Turner, and five upgraded \"Private Dancer\" music videos. Other exclusive content will be available in other formats.\nContributing: Melissa Ruggieri, USA TODAY\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: New, unreleased Tina Turner song makes debut: 'Hot For You Baby'",
