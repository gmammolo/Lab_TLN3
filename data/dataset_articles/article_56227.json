  "text": "Shivali Gurung from Nepal and Nicholas Ming Pak from Singapore claimed the top honours in the Girls’ and Boys’ Singles finals at the ITF Asia 14 and Under Development Championships 2025 Regional Qualifying Event for South, Southeast, and East Asia – Week 2, which concluded at the Sri Lanka Tennis Association’s clay courts in Colombo yesterday.\nGurung dominated the girls’ singles final, defeating Sri Lanka’s Annaya Norbet with a commanding 6-3, 6-0 scoreline. The match showcased Gurung’s powerful groundstrokes and solid court coverage, leaving Norbet struggling to keep pace.\nIn the boys’ singles final, Pak emerged as the champion, overcoming Anthony Castigador from the Philippines with a 7-6, 6-2, 6-1 victory. Pak’s ability to stay composed during critical points, particularly in the first-set tiebreak, was instrumental in securing his triumph.\nThe tournament, which featured players from 10 countries across South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, took place over two weeks, from January 13 to 23.",
