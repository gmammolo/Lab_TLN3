  "text": "If you're a horror fan, Oscar season is usually a time to be disappointed and upset, because it's when the genre is always overlooked. Horror is so often looked down upon when it comes to awards, despite not only being popular with audiences but also how critically acclaimed horror movies have become. The Silence of the Lambs might have ruled the 1992 Academy Awards, but that was the exception to the rule. (I'm still not over Toni Collette not even getting a nomination for Hereditary.) However, the just-released Oscar nominations offered a great surprise, with horror nominated in several categories, from Best Picture to Best Director, and Best Actress. The Substance and Demi Moore's performance are a big part of that, but Nosferatu, Alien: Romulus, and The Girl With the Needle were recognized as well. It's about time!\n'The Substance' Is Nominated For Several Oscars\nThe Substance was the most talked about horror movie of the year. Written and directed by Coralie Fargeat (Revenge), and starring Demi Moore, Margaret Qualley, and Dennis Quaid, The Substance's jaw-dropping, body horror story about the lengths an aging female star will go to stay relevant was not only a critical darling but a box office success as well, making $76 million worldwide. All the attention led to several Golden Globe nominations, including a win for Moore, whose performance might be the best of her career. It was surprisingly her first-ever nomination, and now the Academy is noticing her too because Demi Moore has been nominated for Best Actress. Fans had hoped Qualley would get a nomination, but unfortunately, she didn't make the cut.\nThe nominations don't end with Demi Moore. The Substance is also among the ten nominees for Best Picture (it's the only horror movie on the list), Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Fargeat, and Best Makeup & Hairstyling for Pierre-Olivier Persin, Stéphanie Guillon, and Marilyne Scarselli. Usually, horror can't even get recognized at the Academy Awards, but this year, The Substance received an impressive five nominations.\n'Nosferatu' and 'Alien: Romulus' Get Their Recognition as Well\nThe Substance was the talk of the horror world in 2024, but at the end of the year, the conversation turned to Robert Eggers' Nosferatu, starring Bill Skarsgård, Lily-Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Willem Dafoe. Sadly, despite the praise it got, it wasn't enough for a Best Picture nomination or Best Director for Eggers. However, Nosferatu wasn't shut out. David White, Traci Loader, and Suzanne Stokes-Munton were nominated for Best Makeup & Hairstyling. Watch Nosferatu and tell me you weren't completely absorbed into the universe it created. Who knows, maybe Count Orlok's mustache had something to do with it too!\nLinda Muir was nominated for Best Costume Design for how she was able to transport the viewer to the fashion of a bygone era. It also received a nomination for Best Production Design (Production design: Craig Lathrop, Set decoration: Beatrice Brentnerovà) because, like Muir's work of how well it took us back to another world and made us feel like we were right there in it. All of that came together for a final nomination for Jarin Blaschke in the category of Best Cinematography for the haunting visuals he put on screen.\nRelated\n‘The Substance’ Does Jekyll and Hyde Better Than Most 'Jekyll and Hyde' Movies\nRemember, you are one.\nThere was even a surprise horror nomination at the Oscars for the Alien franchise. Fede Álvarez's Alien: Romulus was arguably the best Alien sequel since 1986's Aliens, but it didn't necessarily scream award contender. That's what it is though, as Eric Barba, Nelson Sepulveda-Fauser, Daniel Macarin, and Shane Mahan were recognized for Best Visual Effects. With the determination to use practical effects instead of CGI for the xenomorphs and the horrifying hybrid in the final act, it's a well-deserved nod for the crew. If you're a big Terrifier 3 fan, sorry, but it didn't make the cut. The Academy is making progress, but they're not ready for super gory slashers just yet.\nInternational Horror Will Be Represented by 'The Girl With the Needle'\n2024 was a great year for international horror too. With superb offerings like The Devil's Bath, The Coffee Table, and Exhuma, any of these films could have been deserving of a Best International Feature Film nomination, but with the category limited to five, horror fans were lucky to see one genre film among them. That went to Denmark's The Girl with the Needle, co-written and directed by Magnus von Horn. The black-and-white fright fest about a nun named Karoline (Vic Carmen Sonne) was also nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globe Awards but fell to France's Emilia Pérez, which is this year's most nominated title at the Oscars.\nIt's always a proud year to be a horror fan, but in 2024, horror has finally climbed its way up from not only being big at the box office, but being considered for major awards too. Who knows how many they will win, because there is a lot of tough competition out there from other films like The Brutalist, Anora, and Wicked. Still, when tens of millions of viewers tune in on March 2, they are going to see horror recognized on a large scale for the first time in a very long time. The genre is finally being seen at the highest level. For that, horror fans should stand up and applaud, no matter if our favorite's names are called or not.\nThe Substance is available to watch on Mubi.\nYour comment has not been saved\nThe Substance\n- Release Date\n- September 20, 2024\n- Runtime\n- 140 Minutes\n- Director\n- Coralie Fargeat\n- Writers\n- Coralie Fargeat\nCast\n-\nElisabeth Sparkle\n-\nSue\n-\nHarvey\nA fading celebrity, Elisabeth Sparkle, turns to a mysterious drug that promises to restore her youth.
