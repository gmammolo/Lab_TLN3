  "text": "Reese Witherspoon embraced monochrome hues at the U.K. premiere of her new film, “You’re Cordially Invited,” in London on Thursday. The comedy, which costars Will Ferrell, is available to stream on Prime Video starting on Jan. 30.\nWitherspoon selected a sultry skirt suit consisting of a cropped blazer and a pencil skirt featuring a thigh-high slit. She also added on black pumps, completing her look with diamond dangle earrings.\nThe actress currently works with stylist Petra Flannery, who also counts Amy Adams and Emma Stone as clients.\nWitherspoon wore her blond tresses straightened, while her makeup consisted of bronze eye shadow and nude lip liner.\nYou May Also Like\nThe “Legally Blonde” star posed on the red carpet with Ferrell, who wore a slate gray suit.\nWitherspoon evoked her character from the 2001 film in October while speaking at Hello Sunshine’s Shine Away event in Los Angeles, modeling a Carolina Herrera dress in Elle Woods’ signature hue: pink.\nThe actress selected a flared midi silhouette from the label’s resort 2025 collection, which features button embellishments and a thin belt. She added on small gold hoops, completing her look with metallic cap-toe slingbacks.\nOther guests at Hello Sunshine’s second annual event included actresses Laura Dern and Octavia Spencer, the former of which costarred with Witherspoon in HBO’s “Big Little Lies.”\nWitherspoon is searching for the next Elle Woods, as a prequel series to “Legally Blonde” is currently in pre-production. An open casting call was announced by the actress on Instagram last spring.\n“Before she became the most famous Gemini vegetarian to graduate from Harvard Law, she was just a regular ‘90s high school girl,” she wrote of the show’s premise. “And all of you are going to get to know her, next year on @primevideo I’m so excited!”\n“Elle” will be produced by Witherspoon’s own production company, Hello Sunshine, which she founded in 2016.",
