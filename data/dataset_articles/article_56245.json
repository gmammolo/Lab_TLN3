  "text": "By Heather Wake ,\n3 hours ago\nWho hasn’t been led astray by dumb bet? The promise of five bucks to name every state capitol, or a whopping $50 to eat something bizarre or grotesque—why, it’s a classic form of mindless (but mostly harmless) entertainment. And sometimes the entire plot of a movie .\nWhen the chance of winning money is involved, that little voice inside our head that says, “Hey, since when can you do parkour?” can become nothing more than a whisper. Plus, there’s the thrill of defying the odds. Get lucky, prove your friend wrong. What could be better?\nPersonally, I still tend to play it safe. I’ll make some quick cash testing my obscure sci-fi knowledge, but that’s about it. But clearly, some people take it up a notch. Jimmy Fallon recently asked his Tonight Show audience to share some of of their wagers with his #MyDumbBet hashtag on X (formerly Twitter). Here are 20 of the silliest, most satisfying responses. Bet you can’t get through them all without shaking your head.",
