  "text": "Skims unveiled the brand’s new pop-up shop in New York City’s SoHo neighborhood on Thursday. The American shapewear and clothing brand, cofounded by Kim Kardashian and Jens Grede, features an immersive experience, where shoppers can browse selections from the brand’s Valentine’s Day collection and more.\nSkims’ Valentine’s Day pop-up opens just in time for the holiday. The SoHo store features an allover Cherry Blossom pink tone, mimicking one of the ubiquitous colors of the holiday. Throughout the store, which was designed in partnership with Something Special Studios, shoppers can find curated pieces from the brand’s latest collection.\nThe signature soft, rounded edges, glossy finishes and heart-inspired motifs throughout the pop-up store provide an aesthetic nod to Skims’ own look and feel. The pop-up features 12 Valentine’s Day-inspired collections.\nYou May Also Like\nAmong the finds in the pop-up, which will remain open beginning Thursday and enjoy its final day on Sunday, shoppers will find fan-favorite collections like Skims Romance, Stretch Lace, Soft Lounge, Skims Sleep, Fits Everybody and more.\nThe pop-up offers a bevy of selection for each shopper’s Valentine’s Day moment. Visitors can also indulge in custom-made treats available exclusively in-store.\nOn Thursday, Skims debuted the brand’s 2025 Valentine’s Day campaign starring Blackpink’s Rosé. The collection boasts velvet slipdresses and lace-trimmed pajamas emblazoned with festive graphics, among other designs.\n“Valentine’s Day has always held a special place in my heart,” Rosé said in a statement. “Maybe it’s also because it’s only a few days after my birthday, it feels special to me, almost like a second round of a birthday. This collection captures that feeling with pieces that are both romantic and cute. I had an amazing time shooting this campaign, and I hope everyone feels as confident and beautiful in these pieces as I did.”",
