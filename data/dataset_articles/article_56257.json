  "text": "The Oregon track and field team kicked off its calendar year with a stellar showing at the Graduate Classic in Lincoln, Nebraska. Across two days of competition, the Ducks collected 14 wins, broke a school record, and achieved several top-10 program marks.\nDay One: Pole Vault and Middle-Distance Victories\nThe Ducks tallied three top-10 program marks in the pole vault, highlighted by wins from Kyle Gibbs and Isabella Nilsen. Gibbs, making his Oregon debut, cleared a lifetime best of 5.39m (17-8.25), becoming the No. 6 indoor performer in program history. Nilsen, meanwhile, claimed the women’s title with a clearance of 4.19m (13-9), tying Nebraska’s Kylie Clark but taking the win on fewer misses. Nilsen’s mark moved her to No. 4 on Oregon’s all-time list, while teammate Emily Fitzsimmons placed third with an indoor best of 4.09m (13-5), good for No. 8 in program history.\nBella Nilsen DUB.\n— oregontf (@OregonTF)\nDucks go 2-2 in pole vault completions today with Nilsen vaulting 4.19m for a new PR![#GoDucks][pic.twitter.com/A2LCuHTIvF][January 18, 2025]\nMatthew Erickson led a 1-2-3 Oregon sweep in the men’s 1,000 meters with a personal-best time of 2:20.66, while Tayson Echohawk secured the men’s mile title in 4:01.94, pacing a sweep of the top five spots. In the field, Safin Wills won the men’s long jump with a leap of 7.32m (24-0.25) and was joined in the top eight by three teammates, including Cheikh M’Baye, who placed third with 7.14m (23-5.25).\nCalm opener\n— oregontf (@OregonTF)\nIn his first competition as a Duck, Safin Wills wins the men’s long jump.

Redshirt freshman Kobe Lawrence broke the program record in the men’s shot put with a throw of 18.93m (62-1.25), surpassing the previous mark set in 2016. Lawrence placed second overall but delivered a performance that firmly etched his name in Oregon’s record books.\nFirst school record of the indoor season?\n— oregontf (@OregonTF)\nKobe Lawrence takes over the top spot in the shot put Saturday at the Graduate Classic.\n18.93m/62-1.25\nAll four legal marks were beyond the previous mark.[#GoDucks][pic.twitter.com/DfRxZ36Bw6][January 18, 2025]\nIn the triple jump, Ryann Porter soared to victory with a personal best of 13.36m (43-10), becoming the fourth Duck in program history to surpass 43 feet indoors. The sprinters also had a banner day, with Jadyn Mays winning the 300 meters in 37.24 and leading a sweep of the top five spots. PJ Ize-Iyamu captured the men’s 60 meters in 6.70, and Aaliyah McCormick claimed the women’s 60-meter hurdles in 8.22.\n“I don’t even do this”\n— oregontf (@OregonTF)\nJadyn Mays after running a 300m in 37.24[#GoDucks][pic.twitter.com/4Sd5ac4J9W][January 19, 2025]\nThe Ducks swept the 600 meters with wins by Matthew Erickson (1:17.38) and Ella Clayton (1:30.36). Clayton also anchored Oregon’s victorious 4x400-meter relay team, which clocked 3:40.88.
