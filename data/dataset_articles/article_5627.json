  "text": "Coletti’s broad legal background allows him to anticipate how divorce outcomes can ripple across a client’s future.\nROCHESTER, NY, UNITED STATES, January 29, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — Divorce not only involves the legal process, but can be a life disruption that affects finances, family dynamics, and long-term stability. Attorney David R. Coletti, Esq. has spent more than three decades helping clients navigate that disruption with clarity, protection, and decisive legal action.\nSince beginning his practice of law in 1991, Coletti has represented clients in divorce, custody, visitation, and support matters throughout Western New York. His work extends beyond filing papers or appearing in court; it includes strategic planning, financial foresight, and protecting clients from long-term legal and economic consequences.\nColetti’s broad legal background—including experience in bankruptcy, real estate, estate planning, and civil litigation—allows him to anticipate how divorce outcomes can ripple across a client’s future. This comprehensive approach is widely respected within the local legal community.\n“A divorce attorney’s job is not just to end a marriage—it’s to safeguard a client’s future,” Coletti said. “That means thinking several steps ahead and making sure today’s decisions don’t become tomorrow’s regrets.”\nClients say that foresight makes all the difference.\n“David explained things other lawyers never mentioned,” shared a former client. “He protected me from mistakes I didn’t even know were possible. His guidance didn’t just get me through the divorce—it set me up to move forward.”\n*Attorney Advertising: Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome.\nThom Georgia, President\nSteven James + Company\n+1 585-730-4762\ntgeorgia@stevenjames.com\nLegal Disclaimer:\nEIN Presswire provides this news content “as is” without warranty of any kind.
