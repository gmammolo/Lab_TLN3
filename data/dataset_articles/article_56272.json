  "text": "Whether you’re dodging snowballs, sledding or curled up by the fire, remember to keep your skin hydrated and healthy in winter. Cold weather can damage your skin, but some lotions that fend off this problem might also contain potentially harmful chemicals.\nChilly temperatures lead to drier air – the cooler the air, the less moisture it can hold. Contact with this dry air can cause flaky skin or exacerbate skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis. To keep your skin soft and smooth, it’s imperative to moisturize regularly.\nChoosing a lotion is a simple and safer way to have your skin shining this season. These products have been reviewed by our scientists and meet our rigorous standards for health and transparency, and are free from our chemicals of concern.\nBelow you’ll find 10 EWG Verified hand and body lotions that are under $20 and available either in store or online from Amazon, Target or Walmart.
