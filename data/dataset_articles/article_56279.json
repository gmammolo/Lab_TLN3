  "text": "OCONOMOWOC — Savings Makes Cents owner Elizabeth Timm is making changes to her shop to better address what the area needs. The store at 1341 W. Wisconsin Ave. had been selling Target and other similar merchandise at a significantly discounted rate. Now, Timm is transitioning the store to carry handpicked home furnishings and decorative items, often from Wayfair, as well as some women’s clothing items.\nLiquidation items will still be sold, but online only. The decision to switch the focus of Savings Makes Cents was in response to what the area is lacking, which Timm said is home décor at an affordable price. Items will be sold assembled, unlike if someone bought them from Wayfair or a similar retailer. This will allow Savings Makes Cents customers to save money and time, she said. The cost to pay someone to assemble a purchase might range from $90 to $175, which is on top of delivery costs.\nTimm said she has been paying attention to area decorating styles and is acquiring merchandise accordingly. Items include high-end Turkish towels and Turkish-made rugs. Customers can also expect to find tables, ottomans, beds and more in the reopened Savings Makes Cents.\n\"It’s going to be a like a high-end boutique,\" Timm said, but offering luxury and affordability.\nIn addition to selling products the area stores are lacking, Timm said the new Savings Makes Cents better matches who she is.\n\"The biggest reason is because it aligns with who I am as a person,\" she said, describing herself as liking home décor but with a desire to save money.\nThe grand reopening is slated for 10 a.m. Feb. 15.",
