  "text": "Simone Biles Nails NYC Winter Chic in Monochrome Chocolate Ensemble\nSimone Biles can stick a landing just as effortlessly as she can nail a winter ensemble, and her latest NYC look is proof. The history-making Olympic gymnast looked absolutely stunning and cozy as ever in her latest Instagram photo dump.\nWeâ€™re especially enamored with the cover snap, which deserved its spot at the front of the carousel. The 27-year-old opted for a monochromatic chocolate outfit, centered around the Fashion Nova â€œRule Breakerâ€� vest ($44.99). The belted faux leather number, complete with a shearling collar and pockets, radiated luxe wintery AprÃ©s Ski vibes. Styled over a matching warm brown long-sleeve top and tailored trousers, the look was elegant, comfy and polished.\nThe 30-time World Champion paired the outerwear with understated accessories including gold hoop earrings and a small fuzzy beige cross-body purse. She opted for a glowy glam look including long dramatic lashes, a flawless, chiseled base, mauve blush and glossy, plump taupe lips. In the following pic, she one-upped her previous look and donned a multicolored swirly striped floor-length oversized fur coat ($79.99), also from Fashion Nova. The two-time SI Swimsuit model wore the glamorous piece when she surprised TODAY host Hoda Kotb on her last day on the morning show.\nIn a later snap, the Texas native captured a cute front-camera selfie with husband Jonathan Owens, and in the following image, she took a mirror selfie as the couple, who got married in April 2023, dressed in formal attire. Biles donned a navy blue mock-neck fitted dress and the NFL player wore a crisp gray suit. In another slide, the duo were photographed courtside as the New York Knicks played the Oklahoma City Thunder at Madison Square Garden on Jan. 10.\nâ€œNY ğŸ��ğŸ—½ğŸš•,â€� the Athleta ambassador captioned the post shared with her 12.5 million Instagram followers.\nâ€œâ�¤ï¸�ğŸ«¶ğŸ�½,â€� Owens replied in the comments.\nâ€œLOVE LOVE LOVE that coat!!!!â€� one fan exclaimed.\nEarlier this month, Biles was named Sports Illustratedâ€™s Sportsperson of the Year. In her powerful cover story interview, she reflected on her historic return to gymnastics after a two-year hiatus. Biles, who was attempting one of the most dramatic comebacks in sports history, shared the mental and emotional challenges that came with it.\nâ€œThe hardest part of coming back was learning to trust myself again,â€� she explained.\nFamed for inventing countless gravity-defying skills, Biles acknowledged that this time, the challenge was perfecting something far more personal. â€œYou do feel forced [at times],â€� she revealed. â€œYou do feel like you have to accomplish something, and that has weight that you carry, and nobody realizes that. Itâ€™s hard and itâ€™s not always fun. So we have to really remember why weâ€™re doing it, who weâ€™re doing it for, and if this is really an enjoyable experience that we can look back on in a couple years [and have no regrets].â€�\nAs for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, Biles hasnâ€™t made any decisions yet. Sheâ€™s taking things day by day, listening to her body and focusing on her well-being. â€œThereâ€™s a lot to take into consideration, especially that weâ€™re so much older. You can just, like, have a great life, go get a job, and move onâ€� she shared.",
