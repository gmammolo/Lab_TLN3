  "text": "Infinity Studio is a Shanghai-based company that specializes in hyper-realistic silicone statues and busts based on popular movie, cartoon and video characters.\nThere are plenty of studios producing high-quality silicone collectibles, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find one better than Infinity Studio. Founded in 2014 in Shanghai, China, the company quickly established itself as the go-to source for the most realistic-looking statues and busts of pop-culture characters, securing licenses for popular franchises like Dragon Ball, Batman, Wonder Woman, Predator, as well as Chinese culture classics like Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Although some of its most impressive works sell for thousands of dollars, you really get what you pay for!\nUsing only the highest-quality silicone, like platinum silicone and medical-grade silicone, Infinity Studio artisans can replicate even the tiniest facial details on their works of art, down to droplets of sweat and even skin pores. Hair strands are inserted manually, which takes hours of work, but the end result is nothing short of awe-inspiring.\nWe only learned about Infinity Studio’s incredible silicone statues a few days ago, while browsing on Reddit. We saw this gorgeous bust of Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman that seemed too realistic to be true. A bit of research sent us down a rabbit hole full of incredible silicone creations, including ultra-realistic statues of Christian Bale’s Batman, Henry Cavill’s Superman, Bruce Lee, and many more.\n﻿",
