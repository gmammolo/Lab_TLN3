  "text": "One of the most satisfying elements of managing others is the opportunity to help them discover, apply and improve upon their unique strengths. Before any manager can do this though, it’s helpful for them to identify their own.\nIn my many conversations with emerging leaders, graduate students and new managers, I am taken with the fact that a very basic question proves difficult to answer: What are your unique strengths? What are the things you do best, the things you most enjoy and from which you derive great satisfaction?\nMany have never been asked or even considered this question before. When planning for a bigger, better future, whether as an individual or as part of a team or organization, considering the assets you have at your disposal is a logical first step. Here is where managers have a terrific opportunity.\nHelping individuals identify their unique strengths, those things they do better than most, can be one of the most rewarding experiences in a manager’s career. One way to facilitate this discussion is to use assessments designed to help identify individual preferences and thinking styles. While there are many tools that fit this description, one of the most comprehensive is the Harrison Assessment, which places a focus on those things individuals prefer to do and those they would rather not do. For the latter, preferring not to do something doesn’t mean they won’t or can’t. It usually does mean though that these are items best left to others who do enjoy and/or prefer them.\nHigh levels of job satisfaction are found in people who are tasked with doing things they prefer and enjoy. Because they are good at them, they get positive feedback and are motivated to do more. As they do more, they get even better, so their satisfaction and enjoyment grow. And so does their contribution to the organization.\nOf course, just about every job carries with it tasks and responsibilities we aren’t thrilled with. However, armed with the knowledge of those items we do enjoy, skillful managers can begin to design job responsibilities that align more closely with the unique strengths of each member of their team. The impact this has on individual job satisfaction and team performance cannot be overstated.\nFor more information on ways your managers can utilize the Harrison Assessment to drive greater job satisfaction and performance, contact me at joe@ajstrategy.com.",
