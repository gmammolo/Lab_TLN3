  "text": "Related videos:\nA 15-year-old teenager and an adult, who had disappeared after going fishing on a raft in Havana, have been found alive and are receiving medical care in a hospital in Matanzas, according to a person close to the family.\n\"They have been found; a ship discovered them and they are being treated in a hospital in Matanzas,\" reported the source who alerted the editorial team of CiberCuba about the disappearance.\nThe teenager, identified as Yusuan Fundora Massaguet, had set off last Friday, January 17th, on a rustic boat from Playa del Chivo, in the Habana del Este area, to go fishing. His disappearance sparked an intense search by his family and friends, who used social media to request help and information about his whereabouts.\nDuring the days they were missing, the family expressed their anguish due to the adverse weather conditions reported at the time of their departure, which heightened their concern for their safety.\nSo far, no additional details have been provided regarding the conditions in which they were found or the health status of both individuals rescued. However, the discovery of their survival has brought relief to the community that was closely following the situation.\nIn Cuba, reports of fishermen missing at sea have increased over the past year. The lack of official channels for searching for people has forced families to turn to digital platforms to obtain information and mobilize rescue efforts.\nMore details about their health status and the circumstances of their discovery are expected to be provided in the coming hours.\nFiled under:",
