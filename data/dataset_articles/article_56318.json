  "text": "PARK FIELDHOUSE — Through the first 17 minutes, the highly anticipated showdown between two of Racine’s top teams lived up to the hype.\nPark, ranked No. 4 in the Division 2 Coaches Poll, entered the final minute of an exciting first half with a 34-33 lead over Racine Lutheran, ranked No. 3 in the Division 3 poll.\nTwo minutes of game time later, it was all but over. The Panthers hit the Crusaders with a 12-0 run, and Racine Lutheran never recovered.\nIn front of a standing-room-only crowd, Park (11-1) used its suffocating defense to pull away from the Crusaders (14-1) for an 83-69 victory Wednesday night.\n“It’s always fun playing another team from the city,” Park coach Casey Robbins said. “I think we played really well. We know how we’re going to play. We just can’t let other teams dictate our tempo.”\nDespite a one-day postponement and a gameday blizzard, Park Fieldhouse was packed by tipoff Wednesday night. Not only were stands full for both sides, but nearly every other varsity boys basketball coach in the city also attended to see how this matchup would play out.\nPark sophomore Zare Gwinn reacts to a foul call in the second half of his team’s 83-69 win over Racine Lutheran Wednesday night at Park Fieldhouse.

Credit: Matt Hardesty / Racine County Eye A frantic first half flips at the end With a loud and energized crowd, both teams had plenty of early nerves. Despite playing at a breakneck pace, the game remained scoreless for the first three minutes. But once Racine Lutheran junior Sam Pitrof got a putback attempt to fall, the race was on.\nThe teams traded baskets and runs throughout the half until the final minute. Pitrof pulled the Crusaders within one point by tipping in a half-court lob, but Park quickly responded with their own basket.\nOn the next possession, the Panthers double-teamed Pitrof and forced a turnover. On the ensuing fastbreak, senior Isaiah Robinson threw a no-look pass to sophomore Cole Betker for an open layup. The ensuing inbounds pass was not high enough to get over the defending Betker, who intercepted the pass and laid it in for another easy bucket in the final seconds of the half.\n“That was pretty impressive,” Robbins said about the end of the first half. “Cole just times it really well. He’s not the most athletic, but he’s one of the smartest kids. He’s a great teammate.”\nAfter playing hard for the entire first half, Racine Lutheran suddenly found itself on the ropes.\n“That wasn’t anything new,” Robinson said. “We like getting after teams and diving on loose balls. We’re a great second-half team.”\nPanthers land a quick knockout after halftime Park started the second half with possession, and Betker picked up where he left off by burying a three-pointer. The Panthers then forced a stop and within seconds, senior Jaxson Moss hit another shot from deep.\nThe Crusaders settled in after the slow start but couldn’t make up any ground until it was too late. Turnovers and struggles at the free-throw line stalled any comeback.\n“We knew what they are capable of, so we had to just keep playing our game,” Betker said.\nWith relentless pressure from the start, Park finished with 17 steals. Statistics have yet to be finalized for Racine Lutheran, but there were many unforced turnovers as well.\nBoth teams were in foul trouble throughout the game, with 38 fouls called. The Crusaders had chances to cut into the deficit at the foul line but made just seven of 26 free-throw attempts. Racine Lutheran entered the game shooting 67 percent on free throws.\n“Things like that happen in city games,” Racine Lutheran coach Justin Hullum said. “I’ve been doing this for a little while and seen it, that’s what happened. The lid was on the hoop for us tonight.”\nThe Crusaders pulled within nine in the final two minutes and had several chances to get closer, but they could not get enough shots to fall. Racine Lutheran, which made 13 three-pointers in a 111-46 win over Milwaukee Lifelong Learning on Saturday, was held to two made shots from deep and none in the second half.\nRobinson led all players with 29 points and added six assists and four rebounds. Betker scored a career-high 15 points and had four steals. Jaxson Moss finished with 17 points, 10 rebounds, five steals, three blocks and two assists.\nThe Crusaders were led by senior Justin Jones, who was held scoreless in the first half but scored 21 in the second half. Pitrof finished with 17 points, 15 of which were in the first half. Sophomore Bryce Austin added 10 points.\nA statement made by Park On Wednesday night, the Panthers showed that they are a team still capable of meeting big moments. Facing a team that was playing as well as any in the state up to this point, Park dictated the style of the game and used a balanced attack to stay in control.\nThe Panthers are no strangers to big games in recent years. Last season ended with Park playing admirably in a loss to Wisconsin Lutheran, the top team in the state at any level that also featured Wisconsin’s 2024 Mr. Basketball.\nWith nearly every piece returning from that team, there is a sense of confidence throughout the program that no challenge faced this season will compare to the one they ended last year against.\n“Last year we got all of our nerves out playing against Wisconsin Lutheran and other big schools,” Robinson said. “These feel like a normal game for us now.”\nWith four players averaging more than eight points per game, the Panthers have shown enough experience, depth, and talent to potentially reach the WIAA State Basketball Tournament for the first time in 65 years.\nLessons Learned for Racine Lutheran Wednesday’s loss could be a blessing in disguise for the Crusaders. Every game against a quality opponent is a learning opportunity, and there is plenty to learn from for Hullum and his team.\n“We have to get mentally tougher,” Hullum said. “Mental toughness is hard to teach because it’s not an X’s and O’s thing, it’s a mentality. The only way to get mentally tough is to play tough opponents like this, get put into situations, and then grow.”\nPlaying in one of the toughest conferences in the state, Racine Lutheran will get plenty more opportunities to play great teams and grow. The Crusaders have experience but still are on the younger side with just two seniors on the roster. Finding comfort and confidence in stressful moments would go a long way in their development.\nA fitting result With the loss, Racine Lutheran fell just short of completing a rare feat: beating all five teams in the Racine area. The Crusaders had previously beaten Case, St. Catherine’s (in overtime), and Horlick, and will face Prairie twice in the upcoming month.\nPark’s win also means that no team will finish undefeated against the rest of the city. The Panthers have wins over Case, Horlick and now Racine Lutheran, but lost in overtime to St. Catherine’s. In a year where basketball across the city seems better than ever, it’s only fitting that there is also parity throughout.",
