  "text": "Small, consistent efforts in physical activity can have a significant impact on heart health, as recommended by the Philippine Heart Association. (Photo courtesy of Unsplash) Published on: 23 Jan 2025, 22:23\nCopied\nThe Philippine Heart Association (PHA) is recommending 130-minute exercise weekly recommended for a better heart health.\nCiting data from the Philippine Statistics Authority, the PHA reported that from January to April 2024, 30,848 people died from ischemic heart disease, accounting for 20.2 percent of all deaths in the Philippines.\nThe PHA acknowledged that one of the most common New Year’s resolutions is to exercise more. However, many people struggle to maintain this due to busy schedules.\nThe organization suggested 150 minutes as the ideal duration for weekly physical activity, while a 300-minute routine can provide even greater benefits.\nPHA Executive Director Dr. [Full Name Needed], during the latest \"Usapang Puso sa Puso\" forum on 22 January, said improving physical activity doesn’t necessarily require going to the gym or following an intense workout regimen.\n“Even small changes, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, walking short distances instead of driving, and stretching during breaks, can have a big impact on heart health,” Dr. Aventura noted.\nHe encouraged people to rethink their daily routines and find creative ways to incorporate movement without added stress, emphasizing that consistent small efforts throughout the year can lead to long-term benefits.\nAventura also highlighted the importance of quitting smoking and reducing alcohol intake, acknowledging the difficulty of these resolutions but emphasizing their benefits for long-term heart health.\nHe warned that vaping is not a safe alternative to smoking. Based on studies, e-cigarette users are more prone to major health problems such as coronary artery disease, stroke, depression, and anxiety.\nAventural also strongly warned that there is no safe level of tobacco exposure—whether firsthand or secondhand. Smoking doubles the risk of heart attack and stroke by damaging blood vessels and increasing cholesterol buildup.\n“Breaking free from smoking and excessive drinking isn’t easy, but having a support system—whether it’s family, friends, or professional counseling—can make a huge difference,” he said.\n\"Start by setting realistic goals and gradually cutting back.”\nThe PHA also urged the public to eat healthy and get at least seven to nine hours of sleep daily.\nTo make heart-healthy eating more accessible, Aventura suggested practical and budget-friendly food swaps.\nInstead of snacking on chips, people can opt for nuts or seeds.\nFive health and wellness tips during Chinese New Year celebrations Adding more fruits and vegetables to meals while reducing salt intake can also contribute to better heart health without breaking the bank, he said.\nHe urged the public to follow the Pinggang Pinoy guidelines (17 percent fruits, 33 percent vegetables, 33 percent carbohydrates, and 17 percent protein) for a balanced daily diet.\nMeanwhile, Aventura emphasized that sleep is essential for heart health, with studies showing that adults who sleep less than six hours per night have a higher risk of hypertension, obesity, and heart attacks.\n“Sleep deprivation disrupts the body’s ability to regulate BP and increases inflammation, putting extra strain on the heart. Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep each night, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, and avoiding caffeine and screen time before bed to improve sleep quality,” he added.",
