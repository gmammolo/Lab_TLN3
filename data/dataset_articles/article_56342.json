  "text": "<p>Bengaluru: For the first time, the Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA) is conducting preparatory examinations for the Karnataka Common Entrance Test (KCET) 2025 applicants to make students familiar with the test pattern.</p>.<p>Considering that several students, mostly those from rural areas, are getting confused while writing KCET in the Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) sheets, the KEA has decided to conduct the preparatory examinations.</p>.<p>KEA Executive Director Prasanna H said, “When students are used to writing descriptive answers, it is common to get confused while attempting on OMR sheets and it may lead to mistakes also. To prevent such mistakes due to confusion, we have introduced the preparatory examinations.” </p>.Over 1,500 medical seats to be added following RGUHS approval .<p>The Authority said 10% to 15% of students who appeared for KCET were found committing mistakes in the previous years.</p>.<p><strong>‘Avoid mistakes’</strong></p>.<p>“They were not used to the OMR sheets. There are even instances of students making mistakes while mentioning the version code on their booklet. Conducting preparatory examinations will help students to avoid such mistakes,” Prasanna explained.</p>.<p class=\\\"bodytext\\\">It has instructed the colleges to conduct two preparatory examinations and sent eight OMR sheets per student to the colleges. The college principals have been asked to prepare a question paper for 60 marks and conduct preparatory examinations. </p>",
