  "text": "Cast and crew of \"The Substance,\" \"The Brutalist\" and more react to their nominations\nLOS ANGELES -- The nominees for the 97th Academy Awards were announced early Thursday morning. See here for the full list.\nFrom first-time nominees to multi-nominated cast and crew, these are their reactions.\n\"A Complete Unknown\" received eight Oscar nominations including three in the acting categories.\nBest actor nominee Timothée Chalamet had this to say about his nomination:\n\"I am enormously honored by this distinction. But most sincerely, I am OVERJOYED for the production's recognition today! I am so grateful for Monica Barbaro and Edward Norton's dedication to bring the folk icons Pete Seeger and Joan Baez to life. I am privileged to have worked alongside my friend Elle Fanning who is truly a generational talent. I am incredibly proud of our technical team and Arianne Phillips for bringing a fresh perspective to the 1960s. Most crucially, I am grateful to the GREAT JAMES MANGOLD, who guided this production with an experienced and masterful hand. And of course, none of this would have been possible without the incredible artist, poet, thinker, extraordinary unknown that is Mr. Bob Dylan (and Jeff Rosen for giving me the keys to the tour bus). For our film to be recognized by the Academy in this way is a testament to Bob's lasting legacy. Thank you!!!\"\nEdward Norton has been nominated four times for an Oscar. On this nomination, Norton says, \"I think in truth this is a compliment to our whole terrific ensemble of actors, which Jim Mangold directed so brilliantly. And if it helps connect more people to the inspiring life and spirit of Pete Seeger, even better. It was the greatest privilege to get to channel his beautiful spirit.\"\nSupporting actress nominee Monica Barbaro released this statement upon news of her nomination.\n\"I was literally floored upon receiving the news of this nomination - same as I was when Jim cast me in this film in the first place. Getting to be a part of this project has been the honor of a lifetime because of how much respect I have for Joan Baez and all the artists we portray in A COMPLETE UNKNOWN, as well as the artists I've gotten to collaborate with in the making of this film. I'm immensely proud of everyone involved in this movie, completely humbled to see my name amongst the actresses in this category who I hold in such high regard, and am deeply grateful to the Academy for this recognition of everyone's brilliant work.\"\nThis is the second nomination for writing and fifth overall for director and writer James Mangold, including his nominations this year. He released this statement.\n\"A COMPLETE UNKNOWN was a genuine act of faith on the part of so many. It was 6 years in the making and required a huge amount of dedication from our team and our brilliant cast. I am thrilled and elated with our 8 nominations! Much gratitude to Searchlight and Disney, my fellow producers, my co-writer Jay Cocks, to the Academy for this honor, to Timothée Chalamet for his partnership and friendship and of course for the trust that Bob Dylan extended to us I am forever grateful.\"\nCostume designer Arianne Phillips said of her nomination, \"I am still in shock, beyond thrilled and honored to be recognized alongside my friend and Director James Mangold. Especially being acknowledged for a film that has been a deeply personal and rewarding experience, AND after many delays, one that took us 5 years to make!\"\nThe film's producers Fred Berger and Alex Heineman released a statement about the acclaim.\n\"We're humbled and overwhelmed by the incredible recognition from the Academy, alongside films we admire so much. To play a small part in celebrating and sharing Bob Dylan's legacy has been a dream realized for all of us.Dylan's music and lyrics have resonated for over six decades because of his boundless creativity, singular artistry, and refusal to be boxed in. His constant evolution has served as inspiration to all of us who were fortunate to spend time in his orbit. We share this honor with our fellow producer and brilliant writer/director James Mangold, co-writer Jay Cocks, our extraordinary crew, and dream cast led by Timothée Chalamet, Edward Norton, Monica Barbaro, and Elle Fanning. Most importantly, we share this moment with our partner, the legendary Jeff Rosen who began this journey, and Bob Dylan himself, for all of his gifts.\"\nFirst-time Oscar nominee Zoe Saldaña released the following statement.\n\"I don't think I can properly express the deep levels of gratitude and joy I feel for the recognition EMILIA PÉREZ has been given. Being part of the beautiful family Jacques created was a dream and every single person involved poured their love into telling this powerful story. I'm especially grateful to Karla, whose bravery and talent brought so much depth and authenticity to 'Emilia'. It's a bittersweet moment as our community in Los Angeles is processing the heartbreaking losses from the ongoing fires - homes, schools, businesses and entire neighborhoods. My heart is with all those affected and I'm sending endless love and appreciation to our fearless first responders and everyone working to help rebuild our city.\"\nThe film also had nominations for Best Original Score and Best Original Songs and Camille and Clément Ducol released this statement.\n\"We are overwhelmed by these nominations. Music and community is our life and to be nominated in two music categories by our film music community surpasses anything we could have possibly imagined. We wholeheartedly thank The Academy and congratulate our fellow Emilia Perez nominees Jacques, Zoé, Karla Sofía, Paul, Juliette, Cyril and their teams. We are so proud of your bold and incredible work being recognized. We also owe a big thanks to Selena, Edgar, Adriana, Julia, Pierre Marie, and Pascal. Congrats to all the nominees!\"\n\"Wicked\" was a huge hit at the box office and has now earned ten Oscar nominations.\nSupporting actress nominee Ariana Grande posted her reaction to Instagram, saying in part, \"I cannot stop crying, to no one's surprise. I'm humbled and deeply honored to be in such brilliant company and sharing this with tiny Ari who sat and studied Judy Garland singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow just before the big, beautiful bubble entered. I'm so proud of you, Tiny. Thank you again, from the bottom of my heart, for this acknowledgement.\"\nShe acknowledged director Jon M. Chu, thanking him taking a chance on her and \"for being the most unbelievably brilliant leader, human being, and most fierce friend. i am so deeply proud of my beautiful Wicked family.\"\nShe also recognized costar Cynthia Erivo, saying, \"your brilliance is never ending and you deserve every flower (tulip) in every garden. i love you unconditionally, always.\"\nDirector Kelsey Mann and producer Mark Nielsen were feeling all the emotions on their nomination for Best Animated Film for \"Inside Out 2.\"\n\"Thank you to the Academy for this tremendous honor. Over the past few weeks we've had the opportunity to attend screenings and various talks and events for our film, and it's been a real inspiration to hear from audiences about how Inside Out 2 has affected them. People have shared stories about their own struggles with anxiety, or how the film inspired their child to better accept themselves, or from teachers who show the film in classrooms to incite discussions about emotions. Honestly, it makes us tear up hearing these things. We'd hoped to make a film that would entertain people and have a meaningful impact on the world, and what we've been hearing makes us feel like maybe we came close to doing just that. And a nomination like this? It's incredibly important as it underscores just how much the film did resonate. Thank you.\"\nNick Park and Merlin Crossingham released the following statement on their Best Animated Feature nomination.\n\"We are immensely honoured that our film has been nominated for an Academy Award, and it is especially meaningful to receive this recognition from our peers around the world. This nomination is a testament to the enduring love for Wallace & Gromit, as well as the incredible talent and hard work of our entire team, in the UK and beyond.\"\nJeremy Strong's statement on his Best Supporting Actor nomination for \"The Apprentice\" is as follows.\n\"This morning's nomination is indescribably meaningful to me. This film has been an uphill battle every step of the way and faced inestimable resistance on every front. It feels absolutely miraculous to me that both Sebastian and I were recognized. Roy Cohn's long, dark shadow was hanging over the Capitol Rotunda on Monday and his legacy of aggression, misinformation and untruth is now a Kingdom Come. This is a harrowing and courageous film that explores how we got to where we are today and was the role of a lifetime.\nToday's nomination is, without overstatement, a realization of a lifelong dream. I remember spending the night on cold metal bleachers outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in 1993 with my father to watch the actors and actresses arrive at the 65th Academy Awards. I remember being unable to sleep because of how exciting it was to be close to that world. I have not lost that feeling of excitement; I feel it every time I go to set or drive onto a lot or begin rehearsals. I have devoted my life to the attempt to do genuine work that would be worthy of this honor. I am filled with amazement and flooded with emotion and with deep gratitude to my peers in the Academy.\"\nBest Actor nominee Ralph Fiennes had this to say about \"Conclave\" and its eight nominations.\n\"I'm thrilled to be nominated and to be celebrating the other nominations for Conclave. Edward Berger brought an extraordinary cast and crew together - he is an inspirational director with rare insight and a unique vision which lies at the heart of this film.\"\n\"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" Visual Effects supervisor Erik Winquist released a statement on behalf of himself and his colleagues Paul Story and Stephen Unterfranz on their nomination.\n\"We were thrilled to wake up to the good news this morning. It is an honour getting to represent the more than a thousand artists, developers, production, and support crew who worked their magic for over a year on Kingdom. Collaborating with Wes Ball and 20th Century on this was a delight and it's so satisfying to see our work recognised by the Academy. We're looking forward to celebrating this past year of cinema on March 2nd.\"\nSongwriter Diane Warren is celebrating her 16th Oscar nomination in the Original Song Category. She had this to say about today's news.\n\"I'm so proud and honored to be nominated for my song 'The Journey' from Tyler Perry's Netflix film The Six Triple Eight. Inspired by the powerful true story of these incredible women and brought to life with perfection by the amazing artist H.E.R., this song about resilience resonates within the movie and in life. We are all on our own Journey.\"\n\"I'm Still Here\" producers Maria Carlota Bruno and Rodrigo Teixeira released this statement.\n\"It is with great emotion that we receive the three nominations: Best International Feature Film, Best Actress in a Leading Role, and Best Picture. This achievement was only possible thanks to Walter Salles's masterful direction in bringing \"I'm Still Here\" to life, to the talent and dedication of Fernanda Torres, of Selton Mello, and of the entire cast and crew, as well as to the special participation of Fernanda Montenegro. None of this would have been possible without Marcelo Rubens Paiva's book and the support of the Rubens Paiva family. It is wonderful to see their story reach so many people, not only in Brazil but also abroad. This is the first time a Brazilian film has been nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. \"I'm Still Here\" has already made history in Brazil, with over 3.6 million viewers, and we hope these nominations will make the film travel even further, allowing more people to learn about this cruel chapter in our country's history and to recognize the essential value of democracy.\"\nAnd Best Actress nominee Fernanda Torres had this to say about her achievement:\n\"I am deeply humbled by the Academy's recognition and honored to stand alongside the remarkable women in this category. Portraying Eunice Paiva was an immense privilege, as it allowed me to embody a woman whose life was defined by extraordinary resilience and a quiet, unwavering strength. To stand here today, representing Brazil in a lineage that began with my mother's trailblazing journey, is both surreal and deeply moving. I would like to express my gratitude to both Walter Salles, who brought this story to the screen with such sensitivity and artistry, and Marcelo Rubens Paiva, whose memoir provided the foundation for us to share his family's story. This moment belongs to all of us.\"\nDemi Moore, who received her first-ever Oscar nomination for Actress in a Leading Role in \"The Substance\" released the following statement.\n\"Being nominated for an Oscar is an incredible honor and these last few months have been beyond my wildest dreams. Truly there are no words to fully express my joy and overwhelming gratitude for this recognition. Not only for me but for what this film represents. I am deeply humbled. This is a time of incredible contrasts and right now, my heart is with my friends, family, neighbors, and community here in LA. The fires have devastated so many lives but to see the way our community has united leaves me in awe of the resilience and compassion that defines us, and this moment is a reminder of how incredible we are when we stand together.\"\nDirector Coralie Fargea told ABC News, \"I think we are used to putting people into boxes. If you are this, then you can't do that, or if you look like that, you can't do that, and I think this movie is about exploding the boxed.\"\nMikey Madison, who starred in \"Anora\" was also nominated for her first Oscar, in the Actress in a Leading Role category.\nMadison said to ABC News \"I'm absolutely floating right now... I think I was watching you guys. I was in bed in my hotel, facetime with my mom... She was crying, and it was very sweet and then she immediately humbled me by saying in the same sentence, 'Oh congrats sweeties. I love you so much. Also, you need to take your dog to obedience training.'\"\nYura Borasov was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, telling ABC News \"My wife was screaming. I lost (concentration for) every nomination after that because my wife was screaming (for) an hour after that.\"\n\"The Brutalist\" was nominated for 10 Oscars.\nThis marks Adrien Brody's second nomination. He won in 2002 for his leading role in \"The Pianist.\"\nHe said, \"Thank you to all my peers and colleagues at the Academy for this extraordinary honor. For almost four decades, I've experienced the peaks and valleys of being an artist. It's given me perspective and a tremendous appreciation and respect for this moment.\nPortraying Laszlo Toth, and representing the hardships and yearnings of so many, including the very struggles of my own family, has rekindled my own sense of being and belonging, and believing again.\nSharing this profound experience with our talented and dedicated cast and crew on THE BRUTALIST has been a rare gift that I am endlessly grateful for. Thank you for honoring us all with this recognition, I am only here through the support of many; I am truly humbled and will cherish this momentous occasion forever.\"\nDirector Brady Corbet released a statement with Mona Fastvold. The two were nominated for Best Original Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture.\n\"On behalf of our entire team, we are so incredibly touched. We did not make this film with any such a destination in mind but having received the news this morning, can only thank our endlessly dedicated crew made up of individuals from all over the world, especially our Hungarian team who we hoped to faithfully honor by the portrayals of Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones's characterizations of their roles.\nI'd like to use this opportunity to highlight the work of Viktória Petrányi and her extraordinary team at Proton Cinema in Budapest whom this film simply would not exist without.\nMona and I are endlessly grateful to the Academy and A24 and Universal International for guiding us through this journey.\"\nDaniel Blumberg was nominated for Best Original Score, stating, \"Thank you very much to the Academy, I really appreciate the work being recognised like this, and I'm so proud of my friend Brady for making this film. Thank you to Peter Walsh and some of my favourite musicians, including the legendary John Tilbury, for their huge contributions to the score.\"\nCinematographer Lol Crawley released the following statement for his Best Cinematography nomination:\n\"It is such an incredible honour to be recognised by my peers in the Academy, thank you for this nomination. Photographing this film for Brady was an extraordinary challenge but the most wonderful collaboration. This recognition means the world to me.\"\nJudy Becker was nominated for Best Production design. \"I am so honored to be nominated by my peers in the Academy for my work on The Brutalist. Designing this film was an amazing experience, and a true labor of love. This recognition means everything to me. And a massive congratulations and thanks to my director, Brady Corbet\"\nColman Domingo was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his work in \"Sing Sing.\" This is his second nomination. He was also nominated last year for his role in \"Rustin.\"\n\"To be back again at the Oscar nominations table is truly meaningful to me, especially for the work that \"Sing Sing\" represents. Work which truly hopes to shine bright loving light into dark places by using art. I am so thrilled for our company which also received nominations for adapted screenplay and original song. All of that work is so tender and hopeful just like our film. I couldn't be prouder as an actor or producer.\"\n\"I Am Ready, Warden\" was nominated for Best Documentary Short Film.\nDirector Smriti Mundhra and producer Maya Gnyp released the following statement:\n\"On behalf of our incredible partners at MTV Documentary Films and executive producer Sheila Nevins, we are so thankful to the Academy and deeply humbled by this recognition. In polarized times, acts of grace and forgiveness remind us of our shared humanity, and we are eternally grateful to John Henry Ramirez and Aaron Castro, for showing us that hope exists even in a place like Texas death row. Congratulations to our fellow nominees - we are honored to be in your company, and to share the power of short documentaries with the broader film community.\"\nThe 97th Oscars Awards, hosted by Conan O'Brien, begin at 7 p.m. ET | 4 p.m. PT on ABC.\nThe Walt Disney Company is the parent company of ABC and this ABC station.",
