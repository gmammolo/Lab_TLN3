  "text": "Jennifer Aniston is a timeless beauty icon. From her radiant complexion to her effortlessly youthful glow, she makes 50 look like 30 without missing a beat. Her secret is a mix of smart skincare habits, healthy living, and a touch of luxury treatments—but surprisingly, her routine isn’t all Hollywood glam. You can replicate many of her tips at home.\nIf you’ve ever wondered how she keeps her skin looking so flawless, we’ve got you covered. Here’s a look at Jennifer Aniston’s favorite skincare habits and why they are so effective.\nJennifer Aniston’s 5-step skin routine\nThese are the key steps the actress follows to keep her skin radiant and youthful.\n1. Moisturize and protect daily\nHer routine is all about hydration, and it starts with her skincare. As the face of Aveeno, she’s a big fan of their Positively Radiant Hydrating Facial. She uses it as an overnight mask to wake up with glowing skin. Plus, sunscreen is non-negotiable. Aniston also adds a product with SPF daily to shield her skin from harmful UV rays and prevent premature aging.\n2. Stay hydrated inside and out\nWater is her best-kept secret. Jennifer drinks around 100 ounces of water daily to keep her skin plump and refreshed. As the longtime spokesperson for SmartWater, she’s always promoting the benefits of staying hydrated. “Water, sleep, and sunscreen” are the ultimate anti-aging combination for her.\n3. Glow from the inside\nHer beauty philosophy goes beyond skincare. Her diet contains fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. Fried foods and soda are off her plate, while alcohol is kept to a minimum since it can dry out the skin. This healthy diet fuels her radiant complexion and keeps her looking youthful.\n4. Indulge in luxury treatments\nThe actress loves microcurrent facials, which she describes as a workout for her face. She’s also a fan of the Clear and Brilliant laser for a quick, non-invasive refresh, and Thermage treatments to stimulate collagen production. These cutting-edge therapies help smooth and tighten her skin.\n5. Personal spa days at home\nFor a more budget-friendly approach, Jennifer turns to at-home remedies. She exfoliates three times a week using Aveeno’s Skin Brightening Daily Scrub and enjoys a relaxing “spa day” on Sundays. Her routine includes masks, scrubs, and plenty of self-care to keep her skin in top shape.\nWhy Jennifer’s routine works\nJennifer’s beauty habits are grounded in consistency and balance. She focuses on maintaining healthy skin from the inside out and doesn’t rely solely on expensive treatments. Her approach proves that good genes, combined with smart choices, can go a long way in achieving youthful skin. And let’s not forget her secret weapon: a positive attitude toward aging. Jennifer’s philosophy is to embrace the process and treat your skin with the same care you’d give to anything valuable.\nIf you’re dreaming of glowing skin like Jennifer Aniston’s, her routine is a great place to start. Drink plenty of water, protect your skin with SPF, and invest in self-care. While the luxury treatments are a nice touch, her simple, affordable tips make it clear that anyone can prioritize their skin and feel fabulous at any age.",
