  "text": "By Hunter Shelton ,\n44 minutes ago\n2026 TE Carson Sneed (Mick Walker/Lettermen Row) Tennessee landed a big commitment from Nashville Donelson Christian Academy four-star tight end Carson Sneed back in August. The in-state pass-catcher chose the Volunteers over a slew of other offers from big Power Four programs.\nOn Thursday, Sneed announced an offer from Colorado and Deion Sanders . The Buffaloes are getting going on the recruiting trail once again and have identified Sneed as a target moving forward.\nAs a junior, Sneed caught 33 passes for 409 yards and six touchdowns, per MaxPreps . He also played an important role as a linebacker on the defensive side, totaling 44 tackles, three sacks and an interception. DCA finished the 2024 season with an 11-3 record.\nHe is the No. 227 overall prospect and No. 11 TE in the 2026 cycle, according to the On3 Industry Ranking , a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 6 player in Tennessee.\nAuburn, Louisville, Ohio State and Ole Miss were finalists alongside Tennessee for Sneed. His brother, Dayton, is a wide receiver in Knoxville and the family feel on Rocky Top made his decision an easy one back in the summer.\n“It’s a great feeling,” Sneed told On3’s Steve Wiltfong . “It’s something I’ve been chasing since I was a kid … And the future is bright. We’re trending up right now and that’s not stopping anytime soon.”\nSneed is currently one of eight commits in Tennessee’s 2026 recruiting class — which ranks No. 6 in the On3 Industry Team Recruiting Rankings . He committed just two days after the Vols landed Greensboro (N.C.) Grimsley five-star quarterback Faizon Brandon , the No. 6 overall prospect in the cycle.\nColorado coming off strong finish to 2025 recruiting cycle The fall turned out to be fruitful for Sanders and his staff on the recruiting trail. Each of the Buffs’ four highest-ranked signees joined the fold after the beginning of October.\nOf course, Carrollton (Ga.) four-star quarterback Julian Lewis was the prime addition, as he completed his flip from USC to CU on Nov. 21. The top-50 recruit is poised to be the signal-caller of the future in Boulder.\nMobile (Ala.) Williamson four-star offensive tackle Carde Smith , IMG Academy (Fla.) four-star EDGE London Merritt , Fort Worth (Texas) North Crowley three-star wide receiver Quentin Gibson and IMG Academy three-star EDGE Alexander McPherson all committed on Nov. 28 and Nov. 29.\nOther top signees in the class include: Pflugerville (Texas) Weiss four-star WR Adrian Wilson , Spring (Texas) North Shore four-star WR Quanell Farrakhan Jr. , Nashville Lipscomb four-star offensive lineman Chauncey Gooden and Miami Northwestern three-star safety Antonio Branch .\nTifton (Ga.) Tift County cornerback Javion Romer is currently the lone commit in CU’s 2026 class.\nThe post Colorado offers Tennessee 4-star TE commit Carson Sneed appeared first on On3 .",
