  "text": "If you haven’t noticed, winter is finally here. The snowy, blustery conditions might not be the best for driving, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t have some outdoor fun at our local parks. Speaking of parks, Ralph Wilson Park will one day be a prime destination for all sorts of wintertime activities, especially when the construction of the new sledding hill is complete. Below is the latest video from the Ralph Wilson Park Conservancy, showing much of the park under construction.\nAlthough the park is currently undergoing construction, the Conservancy is doing its best to ensure that the public is still able to enjoy themselves at this transformational waterfront setting.\nOn Saturday, February 22 (1pm-3pm), WinterFest will be held at 5 Porter Avenue (the area adjacent to Centennial Pool, in the part of Ralph Wilson Park that is open during construction). The family friendly event is free to attend, and will feature all sorts of winter activities.\nSnow-related fun (if weather allows!), activities for all ages led by our wonderful partners, free hot cocoa and warming stations, music, fun and more!\nIf you missed the inaugural WinterFest, here’s a look at what took place…\nIt won’t be long before the entire park is open for all sorts of events, activities, and festivals. In the meantime, be sure to get a taste of the action by attending the second annual WinterFest – it’s only a month away!\nThis event is free and open to all – simply RSVP and let the winter games begin.",
