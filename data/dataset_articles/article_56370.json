  "text": "By Cherie Dupuis ,\n4 hours ago\nI am at my grandparents’ farm and Grandpa is returning home from the field for dinner. He carries a box with small rabbits. Apparently the mother rabbit died from a threshing machine accident and Grandpa found these orphans. I am 9 years old and eager to take on the challenge of keeping them alive. The small wiggling creatures are so full of life. I imagine them growing up and returning to the wild and having families of their own all because of my intervention. I stuff a box with rags to make a cozy nest. I use an eye dropper to feed them milk. The rabbits are just the size of my hands. They are soft, cuddly and mine. My charges. I stand taller caring for them, and I sense that my family is impressed. But over the next few days, they die. I did all I could think of to care for their physical needs. But despite my attention, they die and I am devastated. I wanted to do something so right. How could my efforts not be rewarded? My family tells me that it is hard to save wild creatures and I accept that for now. But deep inside I sense that there must be a way.\nWhen I was 11, my mother took to her bed with an illness. I didn’t know what was wrong but a friendly gray-haired doctor made a house call and noticed me waiting on my mother, stroking her hair, bringing her water. “You’re quite the little healer, aren’t you?” He didn’t know how his carelessly tossed-off words affected me. That little seed planted when caring for the rabbits took root. This man who was a professional healer, and an adult with much experience, called me a healer. I tucked away his comment and continued to look for the secret of healing.\nIn my teen years I delighted in those books about medicine women who knew how to mix the proper blend of wild plants to calm a symptom. I loosely memorized the plants but sensed that there was a mystery in what the healer was doing that added to the plant’s natural healing power.\nIt is no surprise that I spent my professional life as a nurse. In nurses’ training I realized that in trying to help the rabbits, I had been concentrating on my performance and not getting inside of what a rabbit is in its wholeness, its wildness. I secretly began calling this healing place in humans the wildness in the person. I defined this wildness as a powerful drive for survival, a drive full of good instincts and passionate creativity. I spent my career discovering ways to activate this quality through careful listening and questioning. I was rewarded again and again with moments of deep intimacy as a person revealed and helped heal herself. Though I am retired now, I still find life alive with possibility as I seek out that quality of wholeness beneath the veneer that others frequently present.\nIt is said that a person spends so much of his life at work that one’s profession should bring joy and fulfillment. I reached that level of success with help from the lesson of the rabbits.\nCherie Dupuis is a member of the Jottings Group (jottings33@gmail.com) at The Lake Oswego Adult Community Center.",
