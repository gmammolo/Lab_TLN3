  "text": "Brad Tursi - Parallel Love Tour with support fr...\nFrom the venue:\nEvent Description\nBrad Tursi, an award-winning songwriter and member of the multi-Platinum selling band Old Dominion, is welcoming his first solo collection, Parallel Love. A batch of songs that have been written over the past 10 years, Parallel Love reflects where the accomplished artist, guitarist, and writer is in the present moment. Full-bodied acoustic guitar, a warm voice, and a poured-out postcard from the road, “Oh Darlin’ (Intro)” opens a song cycle devoted to a rambler’s life, love from a drifter’s point of view, and the way life is beautiful if you’ll take it on its terms. With a voice that’s a little worn, a little warm, Brad Tursi pours out the truth of a man who keeps moving but never forgets those things that define what a good life should be.\nWith a resonant electric guitar, probably the dark-headed songwriter’s first true love, Parallel Love seeks to find a connection along the way. Conversational, shuffling in places, ruminative in others, there’s a bit of pluck, a little B3 steam, a belief where stripping it all back to simple things is as good as it gets.\nA student of all kinds of music he loves, a purveyor of hits for others, Parallel Love is all about songs that are completely, absolutely who Brad Tursi is. Now with, he realizes. “Finding the melodies that connect is the hard stuff, the person that I am and experiences I go from, those things are right here. These songs? They’re from my back porch, from my heart –and they’re small things that are a big deal if you cherish/recognize them.”\nCreated and released with the band’s full support, the project features co-writes with Stephen Wilson Jr., Dan Isbell, Jessi Alexander, and Matt Jenkins. Tursi produced the entire project as well, with Ben West and Marc Scibilia co-producing select tracks. In addition to his role with the reigning CMA and ACM Vocal Group of the Year, Tursi is a Grammy-nominated songwriter, has earned multiple CMA Triple Play Awards for writing three No. 1 songs in a 12-month period, been named AIMP Artist Writer of the Year, and co-written hits for Kenny Chesney, Luke Bryan, Tyler Hubbard, Josh Turner, Darius Rucker, and Cole Swindell, among others.\nMore information\nAt Smith’s Olde Bar\nBrad Tursi - Parallel Love Tour with support ... | 01/24/2025 8:00 PM",
