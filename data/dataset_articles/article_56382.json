  "text": "Where to drink\nWhere to drink now: 6 best bars near the Fort Worth Stock Show & Rodeo\nFor patrons of the 2025 Fort Worth Stock Show & Rodeo looking to whet their whistles nearby, this edition of Where to Drink is for you. From old-school dives that have drawn rodeo regulars for decades to newer establishments known for glitz, glam, and great cocktails, these six spots are sure to provide for legendary good times. Here are six top Fort Worth bars just a lasso's throw from Will Rogers and Dickies Arena, with one even right on-site.\nLooking for live music during the FWSSR? Find the whole musical lineup here with even more bars on-site to visit during the event.\nThe Bar at Bowie HouseThe newest be-seen spot for pre-rodeo cocktails is this cowboy-chic bar inside Bowie House, Auberge Resorts Collection hotel (3700 Camp Bowie Blvd.). In fact, the bar has been busy with nearby locals nightly since it opened one year ago. National Cutting Horse Association hall-of-famer Jo Ellard is the visionary behind the Western-inspired hotel, making it a perfect fit for a rodeo season pit stop. (The intricate details on the antique bar, including its triple archway, weathered mirrors, and ornate wooden details, are stunning.) Try the Two Dozen Roses, made with Hendricks Gin, Combier Rose liqueur, and cucumber, or the Bowie House Old Fashioned, made with Bowie House private barrel Maker's Mark and Dr Pepper cherry Syrup.\nSarah’s PlaceThe neighborhood bar (5223 Camp Bowie Blvd.) is well-known as the place for post-rodeo drinks, especially for those involved in the three-week event who might need a nightcap after a long day. The epitome of a casual dive bar, Sarah’s intimate atmosphere boasts vinyl high-back barstools, TVs for game-watching, and one of Fort Worth’s most popular karaoke scene after dark. For drinks, think simplistic classics like gin and tonic, vodka soda, whiskey and water, or a cold longneck.\nReata at the Backstage ClubBefore Dickies Arena opened in 2019, rodeo performances were held at the historic Will Rogers Coliseum, where the members-only Backstage Club drew well-dressed rodeo-goers (and even a few celebs) for cocktails overlooking the arena action for more than 50 years. Operated by Reata, the Backstage Club (3301 West Lancaster Ave.) is now open to the public and is considered a rite of rodeo passage for a pre-performance libation. While reservations are recommended for dinner, anyone can visit for open seating in the bar area - just take the short elevator ride up from the ground level of Will Rogers Coliseum. It’s hard to go wrong with a salt-rimmed margarita or cold beer while there.\nThe Circle Bar at The Crescent HotelAnother popular hotel bar welcoming rodeo-goers is The Circle Bar inside The Crescent Hotel (3300 Camp Bowie Blvd.). The 360-degree bar surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows offers plenty of room to kick your boots up before or after heading to Dickies Arena. During rodeo season, the bar will feature specialty drinks made with Sir Davis Whiskey, Glenmorangie scotch, and Belvedere Vodka, along with Texas wines from Lost Draw Cellars and William Chris, and Fort Worth beers from Cowtown Brewing and Rahr & Sons Brewing Co. There’ll also be Texas-inspired bar bites like prosciutto-wrapped quail, porchetta sliders, and Texas cheese and charcuterie, along with live music on weekends. “Social Hour” is 4-6 pm Monday-Thursday and includes specials on Aperol spritzes, old fashioneds, margaritas, and gin or vodka martinis. (Oysters are only $2, too.)\nAncho Chili Bar at Michaels CuisineA longstanding rodeo-season tradition is meeting at Michaels (3413 W. 7th St.) before heading to the arena – more specifically, the restaurant’s separate bar area located immediately to the right upon entering. The 30-plus year-old destination for contemporary ranch-style cuisine remains a popular spot for cowboys and cowgirls to show off their turquoise and boots for pre-show drinks and bar bites. It’s owner and chef Michael Thomson’s favorite time of year, so much so that he offers a special\nStock Show menujust for the occasion. From the\nbar menu, try the Michaels Makers Manhattan garnished with a Bordeaux cherry, or the Fort Worth Blackland Bliss made with Blackland Distillery gin, elderflower liqueur, and grapefruit juice.\nShowdown SaloonEstablished in 1972, the Showdown Saloon (4907 Camp Bowie Blvd.) is an institution for cold beer and good times. The list of regulars is long, and many of them have their very own beer mug hanging from the ceiling over the bar. There are TVs with sports, a small back patio, and pool and foosball tables. Rodeo fans are always welcome to the old-school dive bar, so belly up to the bar and stay a while.",
