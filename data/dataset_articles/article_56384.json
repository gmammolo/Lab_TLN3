  "text": "WorldRedEye\nJimmy Butler seems to be taking his suspension in stride. On Wednesday, the Miami Heat announced that they were suspending Butler for two games after he missed a team flight amid drama about his trade request.\n“We have suspended Jimmy Butler for two games for continued pattern of disregard of team rules, insubordinate conduct and conduct detrimental to the team, including missing today’s team flight to Milwaukee.” said the Miami Heat via statement.\nOn Wednesday night, Butler, who serves as the honorary chairman with Wayne Boich for the Reserve Cup Padel Series , was spotted attending the Reserve Cup draft dinner hosted by the Moncayo Ocean Club at a private residence in Miami.\nAccording to a source who attended the event, “Butler seemed to be in a good mood at the event, talking sports and hanging with the best padel players in the world. He loves the sport and the competitive fire that these athletes have”.\nComedian Andrew Schulz, who is also a team captain for the Reserve Cup Series, cracked a joke about Butler’s suspension,n according to one of the attendees\n“If anyone asks he was NOT here, he was at the Heat facility practicing….that was someone else you saw” joked Schulz.\nThere’s a decent chance Butler will be in attendance for this weekend’s Reserve Cup series events in Miami at the Reserve\nIt’ll be interesting to see if Butler gets traded as reports are swirling that a trade could happen in the coming days.\nVia Yahoo Sports\n“There have been whispers of the Washington Wizards and Toronto Raptors getting involved as well, but it seems the momentum is geared toward this getting done soon, perhaps in the next few days. Detroit and Charlotte could operate as facilitators for a large deal, too, sources told Yahoo Sports.”",
