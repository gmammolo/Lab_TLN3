  "text": "Warner Bros.\nThe first look at The Accountant 2 , a sequel to Ben Affleck’s underrated 2016 action-thriller The Accountant , has been released. The first-look photo from the project showcases Affleck’s character Christian Wolff and Jon Bernthal as Brax, the character’s brother.\nIn addition to the returning Ben Affleck and Jon Bernthal, Academy Award winner J.K. Simmons and Cynthia Addai-Robinson will also be reprising their roles from the first film. New cast members include Daniella Pineda, Allison Robertson, Robert Morgan, and Grant Harvey.\nCheck out the first official look at the film — which is being directed by Gavin O’Connor, who also helmed the original, in addition to films such as Miracle, Warrior , and The Way Back — and the synopsis below.\n“Christian Wolff (Affleck) is brought out of hiding by Treasury Agent Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) after someone close to them is killed by unknown assassins. To solve the murder, Wolff must recruit the help of his estranged but highly lethal brother Brax (Bernthal).”\nFirst look at ‘THE ACCOUNTANT 2’\nIn theaters on April 25. pic.twitter.com/XIZ2sqjE5z\n— DiscussingFilm (@DiscussingFilm) January 22, 2025\nWhile the first film was distributed domestically be Warner Bros. (who’ve maintained international rights), the sequel — produced by Affleck and Matt Damon’s production company Artists Equity — has moved over to Amazon MGM Studios.\nDespite now being under the umbrella of Amazon, however, the film will still be given a theatrical release and will hit movie theaters on April 25, 2025 after premiering at the South by Southwest festival in early March.",
