  "text": "Back in 1966 there was a film, “A Man for All Seasons,” about Sir Thomas More, the 16th-century Lord Chancellor of England.\nNow Miller High School has a girl for all seasons. She is senior Setsianna “Setsi” Kraynak, who currently excels in basketball and wrestling. But that is not all.Kraynak was a back-up placekicker on the football team, making one extra point. She also runs track and previously played two seasons of softball, and one season of golf. As if all that is not enough, she also plays club soccer during the fall and spring.Oh, and she rocks a 4.0 grade point average, with a particular love of mathematics.Asked about her frenetic ways Kraynak said, “I like staying active. If I am ever just sitting around all day, I feel lazy and feel the need to do something.”The Miller girls’ basketball team leads host Pacific 40-11 with 2:30 left in the third quarter. Kraynak grabs a rebound and dribbles the length of the court, pigtails bobbing. Then she dishes to a teammate for a score. The girls rejoice as they retreat to the other end.Kraynak scores only eight points on this night, which is four points below her average. But she makes her presence felt with her defense and rebounding.“She brings a lot of athleticism and contributes to a lot of our points,” Rebels coach Veronica Anaya said.Kraynak also enjoys wrestling, which is good because her father Jim Kraynak is the coach. But she prefers basketball.“I like basketball because it’s more fun to play with a team,” she said. “We build each other up and form relationships that will last a lifetime.”The Miller girls basketball team is currently tied for first place in the Mountain Valley League standings after splitting games with Indian Springs. The Rebels travel to San Bernardino for a league game Thursday night.Kraynak is dedicated. Appearing on NBC news last year, she told Mario Solis, “I don’t go to practice to just go to practice. I go to work, and to learn and grow.”That extends to outside the athletic arena, where she shines in science, technology, engineering, and math. She says she would like to be an athletic director.“I want to major in Kinesiology or Sports Management,” Kraynak said. “I love being involved in sports and am a big supporter of both boys and girls sports competition.”Outside of sports, the 18-year-old is a prankster. Along with her twin brother Beckmond and 16-year-old brother Baird, the Kraynak kids relish practical jokes.“We can’t get through April Fools’ Day without them,” said mom Rianna Kraynak. “Last year on April Fools Day we let them stay at home and they drove to Big Bear. They sent us photos of them in the snow.”Kraynak wrestles in the Halloween Open at Cerritos College. She battles a girl from Rancho Bernardo High. Not wasting any time, she takes down her foe and rolls her over. Just like that, it’s done. The referee slaps the mat. Kraynak removes her headgear and waits to have her hand raised.Despite not practicing much because of basketball, Kraynak is 19-2 on the mat this season and 96-34 for her career.She was a two-time Mountain Valley League champion at 116 pounds and last year won the league title at 120 pounds. Now she wrestles at 125 pounds and is ranked 11th in the CIF Southern Section.“As a wrestler, her strength, speed and stamina make a difference,” Jim Kraynak said. “Since she practices basketball, she rarely comes to wrestling practice. But she’s still able to compete with or beat the best of them.”",
