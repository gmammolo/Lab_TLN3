  "text": "via Brandon Wenerd\n“What are those?”!\nA Mammoth Mountain liftie hopped on the chair with me during his break, heading up Chair 21 on a bluebird Saturday in December as I worked my way toward Gold Rush, eager to finally hit High-Five Express and get to the top of the mountain to rip a long run with some serious vertical drop. If you ski or ride Mammoth, you know what I’m talking about.\nHe wasn’t talking about my jacket or my helmet. Nah, he was eyeing my skis—my fresh pair of Romp Skis Osos , a freeriding ski handcrafted in Crested Butte.\nAs a liftie, I assume he sees a lot of skis, so I was a little startled. All I could think about was that meme. You know the one—the kids shouting “WHAT ARE THOSE?!” that started on Vine in like 2014, blew up in sneakerhead circles about a decade ago, and somehow still holds major staying power.\nTurns out, skis spark the same curiosity as new Jordans when you roll up with something that’s not a household name like Atomic, Salomon, or K2—the brands that practically define the sport.\nEarlier that morning, I had my bindings adjusted at the shop. The guy behind the counter took one look and hit me with the same question. “What are those?” Then, after a beat, he grinned and said, “Congrats, man. Those look fun.”\nHe made me feel like I had just bought a new car or proposed. I appreciated that.\nAnd honestly, he wasn’t wrong. Clicking into those 172 Romp Osos felt like trading in a Ford Focus for a brand-new Bronco Raptor with all the bells and whistles. On the first run, I squealed.\nI was charging instead of cruising, finding new precision, and a little extra confidence I probably didn’t deserve.\nThis is the Romp Skis experience in a nutshell. Small-batch. Handmade in America. Tough as heck. Totally dialed in. A complete blast to ride.\nThese things freakin’ rock.\nPlus, bonus points for the great conversation piece on the topic with lift strangers. In fact, in two days of skiing them at Mammoth, I didn’t find a single person who had even heard of Romps. In other words, an outstanding ski that fits whatever mid-life crisis you’re working through.\nSo it’s time skiers educate themselves on what these guys do differently.\nSo What Makes Romp Skis Different? Romp was by two brothers, Morgan and Caleb Weinberg, who got into making custom skis in Crested Butte when their construction jobs died down.\n“My brother and I had the dream of making our own skis, and the business side was almost an afterthought,” Morgan tells BroBible. “Once we started Romp I thought a lot about a story my dad told me about ordering a surfboard. He described his surfing style and the waves where he surfed to the shaper and the shaper built him a board for those specific conditions.”\n“I wanted to bring that experience to skiers,” he continues. “It means a lot to me to produce skis here in the US and even more so to be able to make skis in Crested Butte for Crested Butte locals.”\nHere’s what you have to know:\nCustom Fit, No Guesswork: Romp lets you customize everything—stiffness, rocker profiles, topsheets—so you get a ski that actually matches your style instead of guessing what might work. No more playing the demo game. You can learn more about the customization process on the Romp Skis websit e . Countervail Technology: This proprietary material is usually found in high-end tennis rackets and bikes, but Romp puts it in their skis to reduce weight and chatter. Translation: smooth rides, no annoying vibrations. Handcrafted in Crested Butte: There’s something cool about knowing your skis were built in a Colorado mountain town by guys who live and breathe skiing. No big factories, just quality craftsmanship. Guaranteed to Rip: Romp offers a ten-day satisfaction guarantee. Hate them? They’ll make you a new pair for free. Plus, they’ll replace your skis within a year if you wreck them—or give you a new set at half price. Eye-Catching Aesthetics: These skis turn heads. Whether it’s the guy on the lift or the shop tech adjusting your bindings, everyone wants to know what you’re riding. Versatile Performance: The Romp 89 is a prime example—lively edge-to-edge transitions, stable at speed, and playful in mixed conditions. It’s the perfect all-mountain ripper. The Romp Skis Experience: Romp Osos Compliments from strangers aside, I love how playful these skis are. They have just the right amount of zip while still letting me dig into turns in tight spaces.\nBack at the beginning of the season, I got the chance to test out Romps. They didn’t pay us or anything like that, just said “hey we want you to see why we stand up to our craftmanship here.”\nI went with the Romp OSOs because my go-to skis last season were the Atomic Bent 100s—gnarly old-man winter top sheet and all ( pic on my Instagram here ). I wasn’t sure what kind of skier I was besides the kind who wants to have the best day ever, which can mean a lot of things: Great snow, of course, or just having a great day ripping with my brother, my buddies, or flying solo in a spiritual commune with the mountain.\nI love my Atomic Bent 100s, but I also found myself obsessed with wanting to build a quiver, even though I don’t have a ton of space for it in my cramped Los Angeles apartment. I wanted something that could maneuver more playfully and handle tighter crags and trees—without sacrificing fun on blue cruiser runs.\nThe Romp OSOs deliver on that front. I found myself eyeing freerider skis a lot during our historic snowfalls in California last year. Great on groomers and off-piste, with a tight turning radius that keeps you off your heels.\nI noticed some chatter on the Bents and wanted something more nimble for powder stashes and unexpected terrain surprises. While I didn’t get any fresh powder on my first trip out in Mammoth, I can already see the vision of how they’ll perform when the snow gods finally deliver.\nvia Brandon Wenerd\nIn addition to the nice touch of being built in Crested Butte and tested on that legendary Colorado mountain’s steep, rocky terrain, Romp says the Osos were tested by the rippers at Western State University’s Freeride Team. They redesigned the Romp 106 Oso, which definitely good for charging, but you will shriek at the playfulness. With an increased taper, rocker in the tip and tail, and a 20-meter sidecut radius, these skis can bounce through tight chutes and stay solid when you decide to go full Warren Miller mode.\nThe Romp Ready version out of the box features a stout Ash/Aspen wood core and extra dampening material for a ride that’s smooth, predictable, and ready for anything—perfect for those who want their ride easy but their apres stories epic.\nThe Bottom Line Getting back into skiing after a long break turns you into a gearhead all over again. I love ski gear, and I’ve loved falling back in love with it—especially gear that stands out from the crowd. I want something with an edge, something that makes me feel like I’m experiencing this absurd sport—strapping expensive planks to my feet and launching myself down frozen mountains—in a completely new way.\nEven if you’re carving up Aspen or Deer Valley swaged out in Moncler, seasoned skiers know it’s all about having an aura that’s uniquely yours. Your gear should match your vibe. Mine? Small, indie, and fun—like an underground band only true fans know about.\nI think, even after two days in my Romps, I’m all-in on ski businesses with backstories and aspirations. It’s fun to build lore as legendary as the alpinists who turned old mining towns into ski meccas. Heritage has to start somewhere, after all.\nPlus, I love the patriotic vibe of a made-in-America ski brand, especially because most of the major equipment makers are European to the core.\nAt the end of the day, Romps are for the skier who wants something different—something with personality, performance, and a little mystique. They’re for the skier who loves the journey of discovering the perfect line, the perfect day, and the perfect ski.\nWhether you’re a weekend warrior, a powder hound, or just someone who loves making fresh turns, Romp delivers an experience that feels uniquely yours.\nSure, the classic brands are great—they’re classics for a reason—but there’s something special about discovering a pair of skis that feels uniquely yours—like stumbling on a killer vinyl in a bin, buying it on a whim, and realizing it’s exactly what you needed. Think about it like having Pinky Floyd’s Dark Side Of The Moon *and* Obscured By Clouds in your record collection.\nSo next time someone asks, “What are those?!” you’ll have the perfect answer.",
