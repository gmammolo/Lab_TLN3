  "text": "By Marisa Losciale ,\n1 hours ago\nAll My Children star Colin Egglesfield is opening up about his most recent cancer diagnosis for the first time.\nEarlier this week, the actor, 51, took to Instagram with a carousel of images that began with a selfie of the actor posing in front of City of Hope Cancer Center in Phoenix. Other photos documented the testing and treatment he underwent over the last few weeks.\n🎬 SIGN UP for Parade's Daily newsletter to get the latest pop culture news & celebrity interviews delivered right to your inbox 🎬\n'\"It’s not the hand that you’ve been dealt because you can’t change that. It’s how you play the cards that counts.' ✨I found this quote from an interview I did when I was 25 and it has served me well throughout my life including recently,\" the soap star began in the caption of his Jan. 20 upload.\n\"The beginning to this year hasn’t been the easiest, but in the spirit of what I said in my interview, this is another opportunity to decide who I choose to be in the face of uncertainty and challenges in my most recent cancer diagnosis,\" he continued, \"Thankfully, we caught my prostate cancer early.\"\nEgglesfield explained that \"after a year of doing a lot of research and talking to quite a few health care professionals, I elected to be proactive and have surgery.\"\nHe also thanked the team of medical professionals \"that have been instrumental in supporting me through this scary time\" and sweetly recognized \"everyone else who has supported me and extended your well wishes.\"\n\"I feel it and each day I’m getting healthier and stronger. I’m still a bit sore but I’m making progress and am determined to come back stronger and healthier than ever especially with the help of my sexy walker :),\" he quipped.\nAlong with the candid update on his health journey, he offered a \"reminder to everyone that you’re not alone with whatever you’re facing and that it’s important to advocate for yourself and your health which includes checkups, seeking information and asking for help when you need it!\"\n\"And fellas, be sure to get your PSA checked regularly,\" he added. \"It saved my life!\"\nThis is not the first time The Client List alum has been diagnosed with cancer. Shortly after assuming the role of Joshua Madden on the ABC daytime soap in 2005, Egglesfield learned he had testicular cancer. He underwent surgery to remove it, but a year later, he discovered it had spread to his other testicle.\n\"It was the most uncertain, unsettling and scary time of my life,\" he once shared in an interview with Jejune Magazine . \"I always say I’d never wish cancer on anyone, but I am grateful for the experience because it forced me to have to develop character, courage, patience and hope on a whole new level.\"\n“It also made me realize that I had not accomplished what I had set out to do in the world, and that if I made it through the experience that I would not let anything stop me from attaining what I’m committed to, which is continuing to build a successful acting career and to make a big, positive impact in the world,\" he added.\nNext: Dancing with the Stars Tour Abruptly Cancels Shows Due to \"Emergency\"\n1",
