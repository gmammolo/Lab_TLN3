  "text": "Rescued in ’22, tiger freed in Kanha’s wild habitat\nBhopal: An orphaned male tiger rescued from Seoni in May 2022 was on Thursday successfully released after a three-year rewilding effort at Kanha Tiger Reserve in Mandla district of Madhya Pradesh. This marks a significant achievement in the reserve's ongoing tiger conservation initiatives, say officials.\nFollowing its rescue, the tiger underwent extensive rehabilitation and rewilding.\nUnder the guidance of MP's chief wildlife warden and the supervision of field director Ravindra Mani Tripathi, IFS, the release was conducted in compliance with National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) guidelines.\nTo monitor the tiger's movements, a satellite collar was fitted before its release.\nThe event was attended by key officials and wildlife experts, including deputy directors Punit Goyal (core) and Amitha KB, assistant director and nodal officer Ajay Thakur, senior wildlife veterinarian Dr Sandip Agrawal, scientist Dr Aniruddh Majumdar from the SFRI, researcher Shrawana Goswami from the WII, and field Biologist Ajinkya Deshmukh. The release marks the 13th successful rewilding operation from the Kanha-Ghorella Rewilding Center.",
