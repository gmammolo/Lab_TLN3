  "text": "Five Rivers MetroParks and Wright State University have partnered to offer four presentations meant to inspire a sense of adventure in outdoor enthusiasts of all interests. The biennial Adventure Speaker Series begins on Wednesday, Feb. 5 and continues throughout the winter with local explorers covering such topics as climbing, travel, hiking and truck camping.\n“Many people dream of embarking on all kinds of adventures, some of which may seem unattainable,” said Chris Buck. “The Adventure Speaker Series is all about showcasing local explorers who made up their mind to just go for it and they share their experience so that others can get inspired to check things off their respective bucket lists.”\nThe Adventure Speaker Series talks are select Wednesdays from 7 to 8:30 p.m. Admission is free. The schedule is:\nAttempting North America’s Longest Sport Climbing Route\nSpeakers: Alex Petersen, Cedrick Gauthier and Eli Capasso\nWednesday, Feb. 5, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at Wright State University’s Student Union\nIn the summer of 2024, friends and members of Wright State University’s Climbing Club ventured to Squamish, British Columbia, to attempt North America’s longest bolted sport climbing route: Guarantee Rugged. This 3,524-foot route includes considerable rock debris and scree, collections of unstable rock fragments.\nHear from the climbers as they recount their experiences climbing three distinct routes: the slabby lower apron, the headwall and the final ridge to the summit. The group will also discuss planning, logistics, techniques and their efforts to grow a local climbing community through education, support and advocacy.\nOne Year…One Quest – America’s 428 National Parks\nSpeaker: Tom Wright\nWednesday, Feb. 26, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at Wright State University’s Student Union\nWright shares his quest to visit all 428 national parks in just one year and the exhilarating – and sometimes exhausting – travels across 50 states and four territories. Attendees will hear Wright’s best stories, learn how to follow in his footsteps and get a sneak peek at his new book, One Year…One Quest: A World Record Trek .\nIf Not Now…When?\nSpeakers: Uriah Langmeyer and Leolani Stanley\nWednesday, March 5, 7 to 8:30 p.m. at Wright State University’s Student Union\nPack up and go with speakers Langmeyer and Stanley, as they take attendees on their adventures step-by-step, from how to minimize your belongings to grabbing a one-way ticket (with a bit of planning) to see what happens. The couple share the different places they ended up during their travels, the projects they were a part of and what life is like living in different parts of the world.\nExtended Travel\nSpeakers: Mike and Dani Mortell\nWednesday, March 19, 7 to 8:30 p.m. at Wright State University’s Student Union\nThe Mortells take attendees on a truck camper adventure with their dog and cat, as they travel from Alaska to Guatemala and beyond. After Dani’s ongoing struggle with long COVID brought them back to the states, they opened a business in Yellow Springs where they sell the same Scout Campers that they lived in for more than two years on the road. They empower others to embark on their own adventures as they share their own experiences.\nMore information can be found on the Adventure Speaker Series webpage at www.theadventuresummit.com .",
