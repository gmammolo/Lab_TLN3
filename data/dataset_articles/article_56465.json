  "text": "MARYVILLE, Tenn. — There's a place in Maryville where anyone who needs formal wear can pick out prom gowns, suits, wedding dresses and all the accessories for free.\nSecond Chance Prom Ministry will host its 2025 selection event from 8 a.m. to noon on Feb. 22 at Rio Revolution Church at 3419 E Lamar Alexander Parkway. Everyone is welcome, but registrations are highly encouraged, according to organizers, and can be made on the church's website.\nRio Revolution Church is partnering with groups like Knoxville Area Rescue Ministries, SunTan City and the Tennessee School of Beauty for the event.\n\"We thousands (of dresses), we have a much larger female attire selection, with amazing dresses, we've expanded into our wedding division, thanks to Altar'd State and Vow'd,\" Kristina Killebrew, ministry leader, said. \"We have some amazing dresses and most of them are all brand new, so we've outfitted maybe some women who are coming through recovery and started their life and trying to get up on their feet.\"\nKillebrew said the event isn't just for prom dresses, but for all kinds of formal wear, meaning people looking for a dress for a Military Ball or any kind of special event are invited to attend.\n\"We have all shapes and sizes, we have different lengths, and we also can help the men get their suits and tuxes as well,\" Killebrew said, adding that the ministry will take any donations, but is specifically interested in menswear.\nAttendees can also pick up shoes and accessories and will be able to plan tanning appointments through SunTan City.\nTennessee School of Beauty Director of Admissions Bobbi Powell said the school will be on-hand at the event, making sure that attendees can sign up to get their hair styled and make-up done free of charge on the day of their events.\nPowell said it feels good to see how excited the clients are once they get to see the final results after their appointment.\n\"It's two-sided because, obviously, you have the moment where they see themselves and you want to cry, you're so happy for them that they feel so beautiful,\" Powell said. \"Even the difference of the hourlong service, to when they come in and they see themselves, sometimes they can't even believe it's them.\"\nShe said the students feel good about helping, too.\n\"But on the other side of it, we get to see the way it makes the student feel,\" she said. \"So the student gets to have that same reaction of I did this, I helped, I was able to make this person feel special. And usually, if you're in the beauty industry, that's what you want. That's why you're there, you want to help people.\"",
