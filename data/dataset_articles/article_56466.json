  "text": "The permanent collections of the Centre Georges Pompidou are full of nuggets. From the birth of modern art with Marcel Duchamp's first works, to the DADA movement, surrealism, cubism and other artistic movements of the 20th and 21st centuries... On the4th floor, one of the most curious works to discover is certainly Winter Garden, by French artist Jean Dubuffet.\nParticularly famous in the Île-de-France region for having created all the works that make up the Closerie Falbala, near Périgny, in the Val-de-Marne département , or the Tour aux figures, which dominates the Île Saint-Germain park, Jean Dubuffet is most notably exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou. This work is the Winter Garden, an immersive work painted entirely in white with black motifs. The floor is dented, the walls have a shape that is far from regulation... Designed in the style of a den, Jardin d'Hiver is covered withHoulourpe, a word coined by the artist himself to design the black geometric patterns that line each of his works.\nThe work invites you to sit back, read, take your time or simply browse through it: to do so, you'll need an admission ticket for the Centre Pompidou's permanent collections (full price €15, reduced price €12 - under 25s are free!).\nDates and Opening Time\nFrom January 23, 2025 to December 31, 2028\nLocation\nCenter Pompidou\ncentre pompidou\n75004 Paris 4\nAccess\nMetro line 11 \"Rambuteau\" station\nOfficial website\nwww.centrepompidou.fr",
