  "text": "The Beatles were nominated for the BRIT Award for the first time in almost 50 years\nLONDON, January 24. /tass/. The British rock band The Beatles was among the nominees for the BRIT Awards for the first time since 1977. As follows from the published list of applicants, the Beatles will compete for the award in the Song of the Year category with the song Now and Then.\nThis track, which took 45 years to complete, was released in November 2023 and immediately topped the UK charts. Along with The Beatles, 14 nominees will compete for the prize, including the rock band Coldplay with the song Feels Like I'm Falling in Love, pop singer Dua Lipa (Training Season) and artist Artemas (I Like the Way You Kiss Me).\nThe demo version of Now and Then was recorded by John Lennon (1940-1980) in 1978. After the musician's death, his widow Yoko Ono gave the material to Paul McCartney, but the quality of the song turned out to be too poor to release it. Only in 2022, with the help of a computer program based on artificial intelligence, the musician managed to remove unnecessary sounds from the recording. The track was then complemented by a rhythm guitar part by George Harrison (1943-2001), recorded in 1995, which McCartney finalized with drummer Ringo Starr.\nOther nominations\nDua Lipa, rapper Central Cee, DJs Fred Again, Jamie xx and Nia Archives, singers Beabadoobee, Charli XCX and Rachel Chinariri, soul singer Michael Kiwanuka and performer Sam Fender were nominated for Musician of the Year. Coldplay, as well as the rock bands Bring Me the Horizon, The Cure and The Last Dinner Party and the jazz quintet Ezra Collective were among the applicants for the award in the Group of the Year category.\nThe awards ceremony will take place on March 1 at London's O2 Arena. The BRIT Awards, considered the equivalent of the American Grammy Awards, were established by the British Recording Industry Association in 1977. This award has been awarded annually since 1982.\nThe Beatles' victories\nIn 1977, the BRIT Award was awarded on the occasion of the silver jubilee of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain and covered a 25-year period. Then The Beatles won in three nominations - \"Best British Band\", \"Best British Album\" (for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band) and \"Outstanding contribution to the recording industry.\" In 1983, the band was also awarded a special prize \"For Outstanding Contribution to music.\" As a solo artist, McCartney won the award three more times and received five nominations.\nAccording to the American music magazine Rolling Stone, The Beatles ranks first in the list of the greatest artists of all time. The Liverpool Four is the best-selling musical group in history, with over 600 million copies of their albums sold worldwide.\nThe band existed from 1960 to 1970, after which it disbanded, and each of the four musicians began their own careers. McCartney (82 years old) and Starr (84 years old) are currently alive from the Beatles. Lennon was shot dead by a fan in 1980 in New York City, and Harrison died in 2001 after a long battle with cancer.",
