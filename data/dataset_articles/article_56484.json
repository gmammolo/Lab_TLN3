  "text": "Minnesota Hunts Harvested More Deer in 2024\nMINNESOTA – This last deer season was considered a successful one for northern Minnesota hunters. On Wednesday, the Minnesota DNR released the results from the 2024 hunting season.\nHunters harvested more than 170,000 deer during the 2024 hunting season. That’s up 7% from last year’s season, and only 3% lower than a five year average.\nDNR officials say the weather this year peaked during weekends helped the overall success in the majority of the state. Plus, an anecdotal report suggested that opening weekend of 2024’s firearms opener aligned with deer activity during their mating season.\nLast year also saw the second-highest archery harvest season in Minnesota’s history. Archers were able to bag just over 27,000 deer, a 13.3% change from 2023.",
