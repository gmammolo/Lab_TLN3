  "text": "Sports\nVictor Wembanyama Was a Highlight Machine in Front of Paris Crowd\nIn the first of two contests between the San Antonio Spurs and the Indiana Pacers for the NBA Paris Games 2025, it was-of course-France native Victor Wembanyama who stole the show.\nTo go along with a 140-110 win, the 7'3\" 21-year-old center was a highlight reel machine. In 32 minutes of play, Wembanyama pulled off a self-alley-oop from just inside the free-throw line, dished out another to his teammate Jeremy Sochan, played lock-down defense, and was the Spurs' leading scorer on the afternoon.\nHere's a look at some of the best moments from his performance:\nWEMBY OFF THE GLASS TO HIMSELF\n- NBA (@NBA)\nPutting on a show in his home country[pic.twitter.com/wEEwDpzVkM][January 23, 2025]\nthis sequence at the end of the third. he checks every box.\n- Rob Perez (@WorldWideWob)[pic.twitter.com/tucMFgZWIy][January 23, 2025]\nWembanyama finished San Antonio's win over Indiana with 30 points on 13-for-21 shooting, 11 rebounds, six assists, five blocks, and one steal.\nNot too shabby.\nThe Spurs and Pacers conclude the 2025 Paris Games on Saturday from France's Accor Arena.
