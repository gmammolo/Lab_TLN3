Image credit: 1stDibs\nOnline design marketplace 1stDibs has released its 2024 Luxury E-commerce Report, revealing how art and jewelry have become dominant categories in high-value transactions.\nThe report, which analyzes consumer activity across key verticals—furniture, art, jewelry and apparel—spotlights shifting preferences among luxury shoppers. As the digital marketplace continues to grow, furniture remains the platform’s largest category by volume, though art and jewelry command the highest sales values, according to data from 1stDibs.\n“Until just a decade or so ago, when the contemporary art market soared, Impressionist works by the movement’s masters were considered the bluest of blue-chip art,” said Anthony Brazilay Freund, editorial director at 1stDibs, in a statement.\n“One hundred fifty years after the founding of Impressionism, high-powered collectors and avid art lovers of lesser means are once again entranced by the brilliance and exuberance that characterizes these game-changing creations.”\nShoppers prioritize investment-worthy pieces\nStandout transactions involving blue-chip artworks and rare jewelry pieces reflect the growing consumer desire for collectible and investment-worthy items.\nImpressionism proved popular. Notable examples include the sale of Russian-born painter Marc Chagall’s “Four Tales from the Arabian Nights, 1948” and American artist Yvonne Thomas’ “The Tower, 1954.”\nThough contemporary and modern styles topped the sales list, Impressionist works rose two positions to third place in 2024.\nTop 1stDibs sales of 2024. Image credit: 1stDibs\nArt and jewelry align with the interests of affluent buyers, who are increasingly prioritizing these purchases as high-yield investments. The platform shares that jewelry’s top sale for the year was a 7-carat cushion-cut diamond ring, listed at $1 million.\nApparel and accessories also set records. Orders for handbags from Bottega Veneta grew by 76 percent year-over-year, while orders for Hermès handbags grew by 57 percent year-over-year in 2024.\nAdditionally, designer John Galliano’s newsprint dress for Christian Dior, as seen in “Sex and The City,” is officially one of 1stDibs’ most viewed fashion listings, raking in more than 200,000 views to date.\n“Hermès continues to be the most sought-after luxury handbag creator in the world, effectively leveraging its reputation for superior craftsmanship and slow, deliberately limited production to drive competition among aficionados for its creations,” said Mr. Freund, for the report.\n“The relative ease of acquiring Hermès pieces on the secondary market makes 1stDibs an important destination for these shoppers, not least because 1stDibs has a constantly evolving selection of special-edition and rare items from the brand that are typically available only to the house’s VIP clients.”\nDecor trends gain ground\nAs digital adoption accelerates in the luxury sector, 1stDibs remains well-positioned ( see story ), with a curated selection of high-value items and a focus on emerging consumer priorities ( see story ).\nWhile art and jewelry supersede other categories by value, furniture continues to be a cornerstone of the marketplace, driven by iconic pieces such as Eames Lounge Chairs and lighting fixtures designed by Gio Ponti.\nThe online design marketplace’s Luxury E-Commerce Report analyzes activity across art, home and apparel and accessories. Image credit: 1stDibs\n“Art Deco pieces from the 1920s and ’30s continue to appeal because they are elegantly anchored in the modern — streamlined forms, simplified ornamentation — while looking back to the craftsmanship and creativity that graces the best antiques,” said Mr. Freund, for the report.\n“Characterized by the use of exceptionally fine materials, Art Deco reached its pinnacle in iconic works by such French makers as Jules Leleu, Jean-Michel Frank and Charles Dudouyt.”",
