  "text": "Sports\nManchester United 2-1 Rangers: Player Ratings as Bruno Fernandes Wins it at the Death\nManchester United defeated Rangers in the Europa League moving one step closer to that coveted bye to the round of 16.\nThe home side had opportunities to open the scoring early, but the opener ended up being a blunder by Rangers goalkeeper, Jack Butland, who diverted a Christian Eriksen corner for an own goal. Cyriel Dessers thought he scored the equalizer to rescue a point in the 88th minute for Rangers, but Bruno Fernandes rescued his side in the 92nd minute giving the Red Devils a dramatic lead and victory.\nGiven the club's struggles and managerial change earlier in the season, some might be surprised that the Red Devils haven't lost a game yet in the European competition. Ruben Amorim fielded a strong lineup and rightly so given he can use this competition to continue building rhythm and consistency with his players and preferred system. Amorim would be wise to continue taking this competition seriously given anything can happen once the knockouts begin.\nManchester United haven't quite secured direct qualification for the round of 16 with just one game remaining. The side will be motivated to pick up a win and earn that bye next week against FCSB in their final league phase game.\nPlayer ratings from Manchester United's win below.\nJOIN SI SOCCER'S MANCHESTER UNITED WHATSAPP COMMUNITY - GET ALL THE LATEST NEWS AND ANALYSIS STRAIGHT TO YOUR PHONE\nManchester United Player Ratings vs. Brighton (3-4-2-1)\nRatings provided by FotMob\nPlayer of the Match: Bruno Fernandes\nREAD THE LATEST MANCHESTER UNITED NEWS, PREVIEWS, PREDICTIONS, TRANSFER RUMORS AND MORE\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Manchester United 2-1 Rangers: Player Ratings as Bruno Fernandes Wins it at the Death.\nCopyright ABG-SI LLC.
