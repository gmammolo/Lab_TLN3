  "text": "Franz Wagner returns from injury to play for Magic against Trail Blazers\nAdvertisement\nFranz Wagner returns from injury to play for Magic against Trail Blazers\nOrlando Magic small forward Franz Wagner is back from injury. Ahead of their Thursday night game against the Portland Trail Blazers at the Kia Center, the Magic announced Wagner will play after missing 20 games after suffering torn oblique injury on Dec. 6 against the Philadelphia 76ers. Orlando (23-22) will look to snap a four-game losing streak that's catapulted the Magic from fourth place in the Eastern Conference standing to eighth. The Magic are currently 7-13 without Wagner. Wagner has been averaging 24.4 points, 5.7 assists and 5.6 rebounds during the first 25 games before the injury. The game is slated to tipoff at 7 p.m.\nOrlando Magic small forward Franz Wagner is back from injury.\nAhead of their Thursday night game against the Portland Trail Blazers at the Kia Center, the Magic announced Wagner will play after missing 20 games after suffering torn oblique injury on Dec. 6 against the Philadelphia 76ers.\nAdvertisement\nOrlando (23-22) will look to snap a four-game losing streak that's catapulted the Magic from fourth place in the Eastern Conference standing to eighth.\nThe Magic are currently 7-13 without Wagner.\nWagner has been averaging 24.4 points, 5.7 assists and 5.6 rebounds during the first 25 games before the injury.\nThe game is slated to tipoff at 7 p.m.",
