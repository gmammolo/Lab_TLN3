  "text": "Neighbor News\nMiddle Township HS Dance Team performs at Philadelphia 76ers Game\nThe Primetime performance just prior to tip-off was a first for the Panthers Dance Team\nCape May Court House, NJ – On January 8, members of the Middle Township High School (MTHS) Dance Team had an opportunity to experience what it’s like to be one of the pros thanks to the Philadelphia 76ers basketball organization.\nNearly 20,000 fans were beginning to fill the stadium as 27 MTHS 9th through 12th graders took the floor during “Primetime” (prior to tip-off), delivering their biggest routine yet.\nThe performance at the Wells Fargo Center was planned for quite some time. The organization's performance crew reached out to MTHS administration in 2020, just before the pandemic. A date to perform was set for the following 2021 season, but with the pandemic still at a peak, all performances were cancelled. It wasn’t until the 2023-2024 season that the 76ers brought back performance opportunities to outside organizations.\nFind out what's happening in Ocean Cityfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\n“This year felt like a great year to jump in and go for it,” said MTHS Principal Sharon Rementer. “I always believe in exposing dancers to as many professional opportunities as possible so they can build a résumé. You never know who could be in the performance space watching and what doors may open for more opportunities. All performances and all experiences are learning opportunities.”\n“These opportunities prepare students for future success by showcasing their ability to thrive in a professional setting,” said Middle Township Public Schools Superintendent Dr. David Salvo. “We’re also working toward building relationships with these organizations to benefit current students and students to come.”\nFind out what's happening in Ocean Cityfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nThe MTHS Dance Team performs center court at selected Panthers home basketball games. On January 4, the dancers participated in their first-ever competition under the Universal Dance Association Battle of the Northeast at St. Joseph’s University in Philadelphia. They took 5th place for their jazz routine and 3rd place for their hip-hop routine. Moving forward, the team is hoping to continue their competition run to go on to compete at the national level.\n“We are always looking for more opportunities to perform, compete, and learn,” said dance team advisor Morgan Tridente. “Our group consists of highly skilled individuals ready for their next experience. Their enthusiasm and eagerness is the perfect foundation for success.”\nFor more information on MTHS clubs, activities and Panther athletics or any other MTHS initiatives, go to highschool.middletownshippublicschools.org.",
