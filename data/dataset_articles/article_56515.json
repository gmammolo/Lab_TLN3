  "text": "Photo: GMVozd/E+/Getty Images\nChain restaurants and popular eateries are great, but there's something about sitting down at a locally famous hole-in-the-wall or a longtime favorite mom and pop shop that has been serving up tried and true delicious meals for years that just hits home.\nUsing reviews, awards and accolades as well as first-hand experience, LoveFood compiled a list of the \"best mom and pop restaurant\" in every state, eateries that have been a mainstay of the community for decades or establishments that serve up family recipes that have been perfected over several generations.\nAccording to the site, the best mom and pop restaurant in all of South Carolina is Sweatman's Bar-B-Que, an eatery in Holly Hill that serves some of the best BBQ around. Sweatman's , located at 1427 Eutaw Road, has a 4.5 star rating on Google and nearly 1,000 reviews.\nHere's what the site had to say about this restaurant offering \"incredible comfort food\":\n\"Barbecue is a way of life in South Carolina, but there's something really special about this sweet spot in Holly Hill, which has been serving hungry diners since 1959. The original 1950s location eventually closed, but this cute farmhouse venue opened in 1977 — and it's been cooking up a storm ever since. Faithful punters come in for the oak, hickory, and pecan-smoked pork, which comes doused in a secret-recipe sauce.\" Check out the full list at lovefood.com to read up on more of the best mom and pop restaurants in the country.",
