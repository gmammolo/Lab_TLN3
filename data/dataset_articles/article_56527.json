Recharging its own battery takes just 2.4 hours when plugged into a wall outlet, or you can hook up its full 1,200W of solar input to hit 100% in three to four hours (time increased for the included 440W input here). If you want to be able to hook it directly to your home’s breaker to cover up to 6 circuits, check out its other bundle with the manual transfer switch included while it is $1,500 off.\nOther notable Jackery Amazon discounts:\n- Explorer 100 Plus (99Wh):\n$119 (Reg. $149) - Explorer 500 (518Wh):\n$329 (Reg. $499) - Explorer 500 with 100W solar panel:\n$503 (Reg. $799) - Explorer 2000 v2 (2,042Wh, new model):\n$999 (Reg. $1,499) - And\nmuch more…\nJackery has some alternate deals (as well as matching ones for some of the above models) in its short-term sale that will be closing at the end of January 24 (tomorrow night) – head to our original coverage here and make your choice while the savings last.
