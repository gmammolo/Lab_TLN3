  "text": "After hanging the sign sold out at the inauguration of Cruïlla Winter with the performance of Maria Becerra At the Sant Jordi Club, it is the turn of a dozen artists who will be enlivening the halls of Barcelona until March.\nThis weekend, the saturday 24the music continues with a very special double: the concert by the people of Sabadell Flashy Ice Cream, that with their unmistakable style of urban music in Catalan will land at Sala Apolo, and Madrid’s Depedro, that after an exciting concert at the Cruïlla Festival this past July, he will return to Barcelona to present his latest project in a grandly intimate concert at Razzmatazz “A perfect place”.\nBefore the end of the month they will also feature performances by The Red Room on January 30, almost a year after their last concert in the city to sing their seventeen albums – and part of their eighteenth – and demonstrate in La Paloma that twenty-five years later they still have a lot to tell. The next day, January 31, and continuing with the celebrations and inevitable events, Hard GZ will celebrate its ten years of experience in a restless Sant Jordi Club with sold out tickets to hear raw bars and the stark voice of Pedro Ruibal.\nThe rest of the actions that will take place between February and March will be carried out by Sidonie (Heliogàbal, February 6/Sant Jordi Club, February 7), Dani Fernández (Sant Jordi Club, February 15), Shinova (Razzmatazz, February 21-22), Besmaya (La Paloma, February 27), Skunk Anansie (Razzmatazz, March 4), Trueno (Sant Jordi Club, March 8) and Sexy Zebras (Apollo, March 15).",
