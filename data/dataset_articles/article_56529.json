  "text": "Self Esteem have set a date for their next album, ‘A Complicated Woman’, which will be available to listen to from April 25 through Universal. ‘A Complicated Woman’ will be the successor to the notable ‘Prioritise Pleasure’ (2021), which earned a Mercury Prize nomination.\nThat the new album by Self Esteem – whose real name is Rebecca Lucy Taylor – will once again adopt a feminist – and therefore political – perspective is evident by observing its title and, especially, its cover, evidently inspired by the series ‘The Tale of the maid’.\n‘Focus is Power’, the first preview of ‘A Complicated Woman’, is built on the motto “I deserve to be here” and narrates a process of empowerment. It is an ode that is very much an anthem and, above all, a gospel, since the song grows thanks to the inclusion of a female choir.\nIn his “transformation”, Self Esteem unlearns the role of submission imposed in his childhood (“I will no longer give you what you want, even if I don’t want to”) and takes the reins of his life: “The world is yours, what are you going to do?” what to do with it? », he sings.\nThe Self Esteem album will feature guest artists Sue Tompkins, Moonchild Sanelly and the highly recommended Nadine Shah.",
