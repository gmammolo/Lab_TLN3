  "text": "Tomorrow we plan to have 5 lifts operating, including the Madonna 1 lift on 3 big mountains. We have 64 trails open with terrain for all ability levels. We are presently making snow on Sam’s Run and Dixie’s Knoll. The Morse Highlands Lift will be closed tomorrow, but we plan to open it this weekend! 28 trails will be groomed for tomorrow, including Upper FIS, Smugglers’ Alley, Midway, Howie’s Wanderer, and Snake Bite for a total of 168 acres of freshly groomed terrain. Surface conditions are packed powder and machine groomed with average base depths of 12 to 42 inches. Currently, it is cloudy and 10 degrees at the summit of Sterling. Tomorrow’s forecast is calling for cloudy skies with a chance of snow showers less than an inch of accumulation possible, with a high of 15 degrees at the base and 9 degrees at higher elevations.\nDo you see the skier on Upper FIS Rime ice is really cool Bird’s eye view of Madonna 1 mid-station",
