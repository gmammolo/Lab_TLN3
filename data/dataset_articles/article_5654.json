  "text": "Oscar winner Halle Berry stunned in an age-defying outfit at the London premiere of Crime 101.\nHalle, 59, turned heads in a black bodysuit with plunging neckline and a silver metallic chainmail maxi skirt on Wednesday, January 28.\nShe wore her hair styled in long, wavy brown locks with bangs.\nThe mom-of-2 accessorized with a silver floral pendant and a long black trench coat to keep warm in London’s frigid weather.\nHalle stars as Sharon, a disillusioned insurance broker, who encounters an elusive high-profile thief (Chris Hemsworth) in Crime 101. As their paths cross, a relentless detective trails them hoping to stop the multi-million dollar heist they are planning together.\nCrime 101, set in Los Angeles, also stars Barry Keoghan, Monica Barbaro, Corey Hawkins, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Nick Nolte.\nHalle’s skin glowed at the premiere, thanks to her strict skincare regimen.\nShe previously told Page Six that it was a “privilege to age” while promoting her skincare product, Lancôme Rénergie C.R.x. Triple Serum Retinol.\nHalle said her skin was “drier than it ever used to be” due to hormonal changes in perimenopause. Then she found the peptide-based skin product that changed her life.\n“I love that I’m more confident than I’ve ever been,” she said. “I feel good in my skin; I’ve taken care of my skin.”\nCrime 101 opens in theaters on Feb. 13.\nWatch the trailer below.",
