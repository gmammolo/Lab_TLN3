  "text": "HGTV Magazine Announces Its 2025 Color of the Year\nVersatile violet is having a moment! Here's what designers are saying about this stunning shade — plus 10 ways to bring it home.\nLearn more.\nThe editors of HGTV Magazine saw this pretty purple hue popping up in recent designer projects (like the one on the cover of the January/February issue), new lighting and furniture collections and on trend lists from brands like Sherwin-Williams and Minwax. Spotting it a fourth time, worn by Frances Tiafoe at the US Open, made it official: This color is having a major moment.\nHow to Add Purple to Your Home\nDANE TASHIMA\nFun and fearless decorating is the name of the game in this purple living room. Tour the rest of the house with HGTV Magazine.\n1. Try Purple Paints\nFor this room in Larchmont, New York, homeowner Raeleen Yoon chose Benjamin Moore’s African Violet. “My goal was a space that felt feminine but also edgy and cool,” she says. The soft hue complements the highly patterned Roche Bobois sofa. The overdyed rug is from ABC Home.\n23 Purple Paint Colors Our Editors Love\n23 Photos\nWow! What color purple is that? The editors of HGTV Magazine share their favorite purple paint shades — and how to use them around your house.\n2. Pull Up a Purple Chair\nRevamp your living space with stunning violet seating.\n3. Make a Statement With Lilac Cabinets\n“My client is a mom of three, and she wanted to make a statement in the space where she spends a lot of her time,” says designer Kristie Rosada of this Philadelphia kitchen. White oak trim adds a calming natural element to the custom painted plywood.\nCourtney Apple\n4. Light Up a Lavender Lamp\nIlluminate your space with a table lamp in the year's trendiest shade.\n5. Put Up Purple Wallpaper\nDesigner Lucie Ayres chose a graphic Hygge + West print for the walls of this Los Angeles bedroom and mixed in other light purples with a Safavieh rug and custom Villa Nova fabric canopy. “These shades create an incredibly soothing aesthetic,” she says.\nAmy Bartlam\nFanciful wallpaper and a mix of different lilacs and purples encourage imagination and playfulness in this bedroom designed by Lucie Ayres.\n6. Pile On Purple Pillows\nAdd a pop of purple to your sofa, chair or bed with throw pillows.\n7. Set Out a Violet Vase\nMake bouquets and branches even prettier by placing them in a violet vessel.\n8. Try Purple Tiles\n“I wanted to be dramatic,” says designer Denise Davies of this Westport, Connecticut, bathroom. Lustrous glass mosaic tiles from Sicis paired with chrome fittings make the space sparkle. “The tile is the star of the show, so everything else in the bathroom is white.”\nJane Beiles\n9. Roll Out a Lilac Rug\nStyle up your floor with one of these pale purple beauties.\n10. Add a Purple-Toned Table\nGive your space a new look with a colorful side table.",
