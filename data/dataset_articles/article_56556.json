Photo: Canberra Martial Arts and Fitness.\nMartial arts style Krav Maga, which draws techniques derived from aikido, boxing, judo, karate and wrestling, made its debut in the Molonglo Valley this month.\nCanberra Martial Arts and Fitness is one of only two clubs in the capital teaching Krav Maga, a highly effective self-defence system originally developed for military forces. Classes are led by Gaby Mora, a black belt and certified level 2 Krav Maga instructor.\nOpening at Coombs Shops in 2024, the second location for Canberra Martial Arts and Fitness has proven just as popular as its Phillip headquarters. Between them, these multi-disciplinary clubs cover no less than six different martial arts styles, plus group fitness classes, and an outdoor bootcamp in Jerrabomberra.\nREAD ALSO Ticks are out in force, so be sure to check and protect your pets this summer\nMartial arts have long been hailed as a great way to build confidence, relieve stress and hone the body. Chief instructor Master Tom Adam says there’s a good reason so many people get hooked.\n“Martial arts is unique in that you’re focused on your own development, but have to collaborate with others if you want to grow,” he says.\n“Your biggest opponent is you, not the person on the other side of the mat, and every style requires great focus, dedication and fortitude.\n“We don’t just teach people how to move – we empower respect, compassion, growth and the will to succeed. That’s what martial arts is all about.”\nTom founded the club on Townsend Street, Phillip, in 2011. It started with just three members to share Tom’s love for martial arts with the community. Little did he know that a year later, the club would grow to 50-plus members.\n“I was shocked but thrilled at how quickly things took off in that first year, and I am beyond proud of how far we’ve come since,” he says.\n“It just goes to show that the community we’ve created here is really something special.\n“We motivate and keep each other accountable, sure, but we also laugh, learn, celebrate our strengths and overcome our weaknesses together.”\nThe new Coombs club also introduced a fresh Krav Maga program – Aware Krav Maga.

Unlike other clubs, Master Adam and his team encourage cross-training across different martial arts styles. They even hold space for a local Medieval Combat group!\nEvery martial arts class is taught by a qualified Black Belt instructor. Disciplines include:\nHapkido Taekwondo Kummooyeh/Kumdo Brazilian Jiujitsu Krav Maga She Fights Back women’s self-defence Kids martial and pre-martial arts. Group fitness classes include mixed bootcamp, FlexFit, PowerFit, FightingFit and HIITFit. Personal training is also on offer for more specific programming.\nREAD ALSO Why 2025 will be a make or break year for many sports in Canberra\nThe club’s new Coombs location is geared towards beginners. Tom says getting started in martial arts isn’t as scary as some people may think, and classes run by qualified instructors are very safe.\n“One of the biggest misconceptions about martial arts is that it’s a violent activity, which simply isn’t the case,” he says.\n“While it does involve some physical contact, at its core, our training is about discipline, respect and self-awareness. The goal of martial arts is to perfect your technique so that you can defend yourself or others if necessary but not hurt anyone unnecessarily.\n“I suggest trying out different styles to see what you enjoy the most. You don’t need to be fit or have any experience; you just need the willingness to give it your all.”\nInterested in giving martial arts a go?
