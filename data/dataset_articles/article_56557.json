  "text": "Hankook Tire Launches New Dynapro and Ventus Tires\nNotable improvements around the tire’s profile, pattern, and compound applications resulted in a 13% increase in mileage compared to the previous-generation Dynapro HT.\nNashville, Tenn.—Hankook Tire has announced two new products for its Dynapro SUV and light truck portfolio as well as a new Ventus sport performance tire. The all-new Dynapro evo AS is a high-performance all-season product for the luxury SUV category. Joining the Dynapro evo AS, the second-generation Dynapro HT2 features the latest innovations to improve mileage, all-season performance, reduce road noise, and enhance comfort while driving. The Ventus evo is also available in SUV sizes.\nHankook Dynapro evo AS and Dynapro HT2\nThe Dynapro portfolio now features an impressive six-tire roster spanning the on-road to off-road driving spectrum. The all-new, all-season Dynapro evo AS is engineered with the performance-oriented on-road SUV driver in mind. With added precision-tuned driving characteristics, the Dynapro evo AS improves dry and wet braking by 3% and 6%, respectively, over the tested category leader. Delivering maximum year-round performance, the Dynapro evo AS features an optimized groove design and contact patch that removes acute corners from the tread’s lateral grooves providing quiet comfort and enhancing mileage and even wear.\nThe Dynapro HT2 brings the latest innovations to the highway terrain segment while helping drivers go the distance comfortably with its 70K limited treadwear warranty for passenger spec sizes. Notable improvements around the tire’s profile, pattern, and compound applications resulted in a 13% increase in mileage compared to the previous-generation Dynapro HT. Helping drivers drive safely year-round, improvements around the tire’s siping count, main groove design, and hydrophilic compound inclusion have unlocked notable improvements regarding snow acceleration (up 6%), snow handing (up 7%), and snow braking (up 9%) in addition to wet handing (up 7%) and wet braking (up 6%) compared to the outgoing model.\n“Our Dynapro line, which caters exclusively to the SUV and light truck segments, has continued to be a source of exceptional pride and innovative growth here at Hankook Tire,” said Rob Williams, President, Hankook Tire America Corp. “With the addition of our latest Dynapro evo AS and impressive refinement of our next generation HT2 product, the Dynapro Family has continued to evolve to meet driver demands and show what a thoughtfully executed brand portfolio can accomplish.”\nThe Dynapro evo AS is available in 26 sizes from 19 to 22 inches. The Dynapro HT2 is available in 55 sizes from 15 to 22 inches. For more information, please visit the Dynapro evo AS and Dynapro HT2 product pages.\nHankook Ventus evo and Ventus evo SUV\nThe new Ventus evo is the next step in uncompromised performance, joining the Ventus product family and leveraging its position as the longstanding dynamic summer driving benchmark for Hankook. Engineered for the modern-day enthusiast, the Ventus evo excels in providing the ultimate driving experience with a high-performance transverse drainage system, widening lateral groves that expand under heavy braking for added traction along with enhanced corning stability at high speeds thanks to a reinforced and flattened side profile. Compared to its predecessor, the Ventus evo improves wet braking by 7%, wet handling by 4%, dry braking by 6%, and mileage by an impressive 32%.\nAs a premium high-performance tire brand, Ventus serves as the main technical partner for the Lamborghini Super Trofeo series. Additionally, it has established an official partnership with Germany’s renowned premium tuning company, BRABUS, supplying Ventus evo tires for collaborative projects that further showcase and validate its exceptional performance.\nThe Ventus evo is available in 22 sizes, covering rim sizes 18 to 20 inches. Additional seven sizes are available in its SUV configuration, supporting rim sizes of 18, 20 and 21 inches. For more information, visit the Ventus evo product page.",
