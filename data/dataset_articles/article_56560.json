Directly inspired by designer Emeric Tchatchoua ’s teenage memories of Montreal winter, the snow-coated, surrealistically structured collection emulates the physical structure of a storm; however, on a deeper level, the collection's name stems from its underlying message encouraging viewers to prioritize the present moment.\n“This collection is a personal reflection on moments where time feels suspended, where the mundane transforms into the extraordinary,\" Tchatchoua noted in an official post-show press release.\nDesigned to appear as though \"caught in a fleeting instant,\" the captivating compilation of garments and accessories zooms in on one moment, extrapolating style codes that contrast with the outdoor landscape and instead leaning into oversized silhouettes and soft textures. Throughout Quiet Storm – which Tchatchoua chose to present down a snow-trodden runway – he throws snow on a bevy of silhouettes, acting as an accent detail on the shoulders of trenchcoats and more subtly stamped on all-white fur collaring.\nWhite also dominates a significant portion of Quiet Storm's color palette, elevated with hits of red and blue. Standout sleek all-white garments include a quilted puffer jacket – which arrives alongside a pair of pants and gloves – among a lineup of pillow-esque pullovers and zip-ups. Collars are\nContributions come from external collaborators including seasoned partner Mitchell & Ness x NBA , Dumas Paris – on a lineup of pillows and duvets – and, a key nostalgic source of inspiration for Tchatchoua, Bruce Lee . Basketball-inspired pieces span a tailored two-toned cropped jacket in blue, a clean navy blue cardigan simply stamped with a patch on the chest and, possibly the hero piece, a suit decorated with NBA patches throughout the top half of its torso.\nThese collaborations capture different dimensions of this narrative—comfort and introspection, energy and presence, and the timeless resonance of iconic moments. Together, they deepen the story of a life lived fully in the moment,\" Tchatchoua continued.\nSift through the 3.PARADIS Fall/Winter 2025 collection in the runway images above and stay tuned to Hypebeast for continuing Paris Fashion Week coverage.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",
