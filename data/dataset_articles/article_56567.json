  "text": "Ah, it’s a new year and the chill of winter is settling in here in the desert. When the evenings are cold enough to see your breath, a sweater just doesn’t always cut it.\nThis is where a warm cocktail comes in clutch and The Parish at 6453 N Oracle Rd. has a couple of concoctions to sip on this winter.\nHeads up: These cocktails are only around for a limited time so pay a visit to the north side restaurant soon. They’ll be dropping their new/spring menu on St. Patrick’s Day in March.\nStop by soon and give ’em a try before they’re gone!\nThe Parish has been around for more than a decade now, so you’re in for a treat if you’ve never eaten there. Even if it’s been a while since you stopped by — there’s typically something new on the menu alongside its classics like jambalaya, shrimp and grits, Southern fried chicken, hushpuppies, and po’boy sandwiches.\nThe restaurant is closed on Monday, open 11 a.m. – 9 p.m. on Tuesday – Thursday, 11 a.m. – 10 p.m. on Friday – Saturday, and 11 a.m. – 9 p.m. on Sunday.\nThe Parish is also a Restaurant Partner, meaning that Tucson Foodie Insiders can score a free app or cocktail with the purchase of $25 or more (dine-in only).\nFor $20 a month, Insiders get a stack of cash vouchers to local restaurants worth over $6,000, free tasting events at local restaurants every month, access to members-only monthly dinner series with local chefs, discounts on events, and monthly mixers with other members. Learn more and join!\nThe Parish is located at 6453 N Oracle Rd. For more information, visit theparishtucson.com.\nTucson Foodie is a locally owned and operated community. Thanks to our partners and members, we are able to offer paywall-free guides and articles. We value your support and invite you to become a Tucson Foodie Insider today.",
