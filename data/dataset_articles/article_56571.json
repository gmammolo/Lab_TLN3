  "text": "When we’re feeling under the weather, down or otherwise out of sorts, we turn to soup to help bring us back up. The ultimate comfort comes in the form of a steaming hot bowl. And lucky for us, Las Vegas offers a variety of restaurants proffering hearty, restorative options. Here are a few of our favorites.\nShang Beef Noodle Soup at Shang Artisan Noodle\nShang’s beef noodle soup hits like an internal hug. Hours of braising have turned the chunks of brisket into exquisitely tender bites, falling apart in a deep red, rich and meaty broth. The hand-pulled or knife-cut noodles are your ticket to absorbing all that flavor, and don’t skip the bok choy that floats above the tangle of noodles, inviting you to break up the richness with its crisp texture. It’s a full-bodied bowl of comfort that’ll put you right again. $19, multiple locations, shangartisannoodle.com. –Gabriela Rodriguez\nCarne en su Jugo at La Vecindad\nWhen it comes to flavor, this Guadalajara favorite dethrones most traditional stews. Simmering its meats in tomatillo sauce, serrano peppers and spring onion for tangy, salsa-like consistency, carne en su jugo shocks the palate in the tastiest way possible. Pinto beans and crispy bacon build upon an already wonderful marriage of textures to the point where this hearty meal becomes something you savor rather than slurp. $19, 953 E. Sahara Ave. #E-27, lavecindadlv.com. –Amber Sampson\nTom Kha Kai at Weera Thai\nChicken soup is universally recognized as a remedy for whatever you’re going through, but this version at one of the Valley’s top Thai restaurants offers a knockout punch of flavor to match its possibly medicinal properties. Tons of lemongrass and ginger lay the groundwork; fresh veggies like tomatoes, onions and mushroom boost each beautiful bite; dashes of fish sauce multiply the savory factor; and coconut milk makes the rest of your day a silky smooth ride. Even if you’re dining at Weera alone, we recommend ordering the large hot pot of this stuff; you’ll want more when you get home. $14-$21, multiple locations, weerathai.com. –Brock Radke\nTomato Bisque at Herbs & Rye\nYou come to Herbs and Rye for the cocktails, you stay for the tomato bisque. This velvety, creamy and downright dreamy appetizer—paired with a buttery grilled cheese—has comfort written all over it. Drizzled in a savory basil oil, this soup secures points for its rich aromatics and smooth consistency. But it’s the grilled cheese dunking—that salty clash of toasted bread and tangy tomato—that makes this an undisputed cold weather duo worth relishing. $15, 3713 W. Sahara Ave., herbsandrye.com. –Amber Sampson\nRB Signature Ramen at Ramen Boys\nUnderscoring Ramen Boys’ most popular dish is its savory fusion of chicken and pork broth. That union delivers a well-balanced ratio of creamy thickness to a bowl which could otherwise be overpowered by richness or understated by too light of a texture. It’s instantly warming and almost toe-curlingly good. Tender cuts of chashu pork, supple and savory, also soak up all that umami flavor, winding together with springy noodles, soy-cured egg and the pleasant crunch of green onion. $18, 3650 S. Decatur Blvd. #3, bumbybox.com. –Amber Sampson\nClick HERE to subscribe for free to the Weekly Fix, the digital edition of Las Vegas Weekly!
