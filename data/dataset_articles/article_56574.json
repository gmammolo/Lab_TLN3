  "text": "The nominees for the 97th Academy Awards were announced Thursday, and a trio of North Texans have a shot at taking home an Oscar.\nSinger-songwriter Abraham Alexander and Greg Kwedar, both of Fort Worth, and Clint Bentley of Dallas are all nominated for their work on the film Sing Sing, which tells the story of inmates who find purpose and redemption through a theater program at the infamous New York prison.\nDallas screenwriter volunteered in prison theater program as he wrote ‘Sing Sing’\nAlexander’s collaboration with Laredo native Adrian Quesada, “Like a Bird,” is in the running for Best Original Song. Kwedar and Bentley were nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. Kwedar and Bentley also co-produced the film, and Kwedar directed it.\nA soulful ballad, “Like a Bird” plays during the closing credits of Sing Sing.\n“It just kind of wrote itself in a way, you know, the essence of what it’s like for us not to see the humanity within people that are incarcerated,” Alexander told KERA.\nA Greek immigrant with Nigerian roots, Alexander moved to Texas at age 11.\nFort Worth’s Abraham Alexander pours his growing pains into new album for a stunning debut\nThe awards ceremony will be March 2 at 6 p.m. Dallas time at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood. The Oscars will be broadcast on ABC and — for the first time ever — streamed live on Hulu.",
