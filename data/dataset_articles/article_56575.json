  "text": "The James Beard Foundation announced its 2025 James Beard Awards semifinalist restaurant and chef picks for Texas on Jan. 22, and a handful of Dallas area restaurants are in the running. Finalists and winners will be revealed in the coming months.\nBut what exactly is Dallas-Fort Worth’s legacy in the awards program? Between 2012 and 2024, the region has seen 89 nominees and semifinalists, though no category winners. D Magazine reports the last time the region had a winner was in 1994, with veteran chef Dean Fearing.\nIn recent times, some years have been better to North Texas than others. 2018, for instance, saw a single D-FW contender, with Revolver Taco Lounge’s Regino Rojas receiving a semifinalist nod for the Best Chef: Southwest category. Then 2019 had six semifinalists between national and regional Southwest categories. The Best Chef: Texas category was only introduced in 2020.\n10 Dallas area restaurants, chefs and bars snag James Beard Award semifinalist nods\nHere’s a look at chefs and restaurants in D-FW that have been named nominees and semifinalists from 2014 to 2024. (And if you’re thinking that a lot of these restaurants aren’t open anymore, you’re not wrong.)",
