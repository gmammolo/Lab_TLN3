  "text": "My social media feed is constantly inundated with the latest beauty tools and devices and while some seem like passing trends, the ZIIP Halo Nanocurrent and Microcurrent Facial Toning Device from CurrentBody caught my eye.\nI already own CurrentBody’s LED Mask and absolutely love it — and I have seen visible results after using it consistently.\nSo, when I saw what the ZIIP Halo was capable of and read many glowing reviews like the one from Nadia Bartel, I knew I had to try it.\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\nThe ZIIP Halo retails for $675 and is the only skin technology that fuses microcurrent and nanocurrent to achieve both instant and long-lasting results.\nIt literally gives you an automatic facial at home, together, microcurrent and nanocurrent work in harmony for immediate and long-lasting results.\nNadia Bartel is also a fan of the ZIIP Halo device.

It does what no other microcurrent device does. It lifts and stimulates to give a radiant glow,” one person said.\n“ZIIP is the best skincare device I ever purchased,” another shopper added.\n“The difference in my skin is apparent after each treatment.
