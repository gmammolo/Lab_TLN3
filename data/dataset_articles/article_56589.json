But Roberts has gone above and beyond being just a star of rom-coms, with her roles and movies earning as much as $3.9 billion globally, making her one of the most bankable stars working in Hollywood.\nHowever, the actress, despite her appeal in the genre, stopped doing romantic comedies around the early 2000s and she addressed this in an interview with the New York Times in 2022 interview, where she stated a variety of reasons for this change, including her focus on her family life and the lack of great scripts in the genre.\nIn the 2022 interview, Julia Roberts told the New York Times:\n\"Here’s the thing: If I’d thought something was good enough, I would have done it. But I also had three kids in the last 18 years. That raises the bar even more because then it’s not only Is this material good? It’s also the math equation of my husband’s work schedule and the kids’ school schedule and summer vacation.\" Trending Pointing to her focus on her family life, Julia Roberts further expanded:\n\"I have a sense of great pride in being home with my family and considering myself a homemaker. For so much of my children’s younger life they would see their dad go off and I would work a little, but they almost didn’t notice. It was like I was only gone when they were napping or something.\" Julia Roberts further explained how she also felt responsible for showing her children that she did insightful and meaningful work, which further made choosing films that were not up to par difficult for her.",
