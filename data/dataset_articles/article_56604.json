  "text": "Elks Lodge #533 will hold a celebration for the organization’s 125th birthday Friday, Jan. 24.\nChris Sutterfield, Southeast District Deputy Grand Exalted Ruler, said Elks Lodge #533 will host an appreciation Friday – the lodge’s actual birthday – from 5:30-9 p.m. at 3100 Elk Drive in McAlester.\nThe celebration will feature several giveaways and drawings. Sutterfield said the lodge will potentially hold a another activity later on when the weather warms up.\nNot only knowing Elks Lodge #533 has been around for 125 years, but that there is only one lodge in Oklahoma City that has been around longer than the McAlester chapter invokes what Sutterfield described as an awesome feeling.\nThe fraternal organization has had a mission of raising money and donating to multiple local organizations since the formation of the Elks Lodge in the 1900s in New York.\n“We support veterans, youth groups, and drug awareness programs, and we are the second largest contributor to college scholarships in the whole United States,” Sutterfield said. “The only entity that gives more money in scholarships than the Elks is the United States government.”\nSutterfield said around $41 million is given annually throughout the nation by the Elks for community service programs, veterans programs, and scholarships. Elks Lodge #533 has donated to various local organizations and causes, including the Hope House, Christmas toy giveaways at the McAlester Expo Center, the McAlester Youth Emergency Shelter, and providing personal hygiene products and personal items for veterans at the Muskogee veterans center.\n“Locally, we are somewhere around $35,000 last year that we gave back to the community service programs,” Sutterfield said.\nSutterfield said knowing he is playing a small part for a larger picture of helping those who need support is touching.\n“It gives you a great sense of pride knowing you are a part of it. Even though you may be the one who is on the minimal side, as a member being a part of it makes you feel very warm knowing it is going to programs that are not funded properly,” Sutterfield said.\nThe current membership at Elks Lodge #533 is just over 500. Sutterfield said the local lodge has been staying consistent in membership for the last three years, making the McAlester chapter the fourth largest lodge in Oklahoma.\nElks Lodge #533 has not been without changes over the last 125 years. The lodge has risen from the ashes not once, but twice. Sutterfield said the original site for the lodge was on Carl Albert Parkway then was moved to Washington Street after a fire took hold of the building. The current Elks Lodge #533 location – 3100 Elk Drive – became the new home for its members in the 1970s after another fire destroyed the Washington Street lodge. Sutterfield said the lodge’s records show the fires did not stop members or activity, as a decrease in membership never took place.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic rocked many organizations, including the Elks Lodge, but Elks Lodge #533 stayed strong. Sutterfield said the organization had a small “hiccup,” but since dining rooms could be open with social distancing in place the Elks Lodge #533 did not receive a massive blow.\nElks Lodge #533 also has a feature that is different from other lodges in the state. The dining room in the lodge is the organization’s main business, while other lodges usually have select dates when they cook certain foods. Sutterfield said Elks Lodge #533 makes a lot of their funds meant to be donated to community service programs in the area through the dining room along with the Grand Lodge’s available grants.\n“We have our hands in a lot of things, and we’re always eager for people to tell us what their needs and wants are. If we can get it done, we will find a way to get it done,” Sutterfield said. “That’s just what we are. It’s a bunch of people who like helping others.”",
