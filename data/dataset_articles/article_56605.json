  "title": "\"I cannot stop crying\" - Ariana Grande posts emotional reaction to Oscar nomination, shares childhood photo",
  "text": "Ariana Grande, the 31-year-old pop icon turned actress, has received her first-ever Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Glinda the Good Witch in Wicked. The nomination, announced on January 23, 2025, places her in the Best Supporting Actress category for the 97th Academy Awards. The ceremony is slated to be held on March 2, 2025, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.\nUpon learning the news, Ariana Grande took to Instagram to express her overwhelming emotions, sharing a heartfelt post that included a throwback childhood photo.\n\"Picking my head up in between sobs to say thank you so much to @theacademy for this unfathomable recognition. I cannot stop crying, to no one's surprise. I'm humbled and deeply honored to be in such brilliant company and sharing this with tiny Ari who sat and studied Judy Garland singing 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' just before the big, beautiful bubble entered,\" she wrote.\nThe photo featured a young Ariana Grande wearing a Dorothy-inspired checkered dress and headband, a nod to her lifelong love for The Wizard of Oz. Reflecting on her journey, she added:\n\"I'm so proud of you, tiny.\"\nAriana Grande celebrates Oscar nomination while reflecting on her deep connection to Wicked\nAriana Grande made sure to highlight the contributions of her Wicked family, including her co-star Cynthia Erivo, who received a nomination for Best Actress for her portrayal of Elphaba.\n\"I am so proud of my Elphie, my sister, my dear @cynthiaerivo. Your brilliance is never-ending, and you deserve every flower (tulip) in every garden. I love you unconditionally, always,\" Ariana continued in her post.\nThis year's Oscars will also see Wicked competing in multiple categories, with the film earning a total of 10 nominations, including Best Picture, Best Costume Design, and Best Sound. The nominations reflect the musical's widespread acclaim, building on its earlier success at the Golden Globes, where it garnered four nods and won the award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.\nAriana Grande's connection to Wicked dates back decades. In an interview with Deadline on November 22, 2024, she recalled seeing the original Broadway production at the age of 10.\n\"I just remember my life changing and knowing my life in two chapters: before seeing Wicked and after seeing Wicked,\" she said.\nHer love for theater led to her Broadway debut at age 15 in 13: The Musical. She later transitioned to television and music before returning to her theater roots with Wicked. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter last year, she described the experience as \"healing\" and a \"homecoming,\" acknowledging how it reconnected her with her passion for performing.\nAriana Grande's nomination follows a string of recognition during the awards season. She also earned a Best Supporting Actress nod at the Critics Choice Awards and the SAG Awards, both scheduled for February 2025.\nAriana Grande's boyfriend, Ethan Slater, who met her on the set of Wicked, also celebrated her accomplishment on social media. He posted a series of Instagram Stories highlighting her nomination and shared a photo of Ariana holding pink balloons while gazing out a window, letting the moment speak for itself without a caption.\nComing back to Grande's Instagram post, she concluded by writing:\n\"I don't quite have all my words yet, I'm still trying to breathe. But thank you. Oh my goodness, thank you.\"\nWith 10 Oscar nominations, including two for its lead stars, Wicked is poised to make a significant impact at this year's Academy Awards. Conan O'Brien will host the event at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on March 2, 2025\nCheck out Apple TV+'s cutest new show HERE",
