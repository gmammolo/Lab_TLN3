The video teases what to expect from the new season as the residents of Serenity town celebrate Christmas. It features Maddie, Helen, and Dana Sue who get closer, as they deal with a tragedy, a town crisis, and a fierce storm together. The ensemble cast includes JoAnna Garcia Swisher, Brooke Elliott, Heather Headley, Logan Allen, Anneliese Judge, Carson Rowland, Dion Johnstone, Brandon Quinn, Jamie Lynn Spears, and Chris Medlin with Justin Bruening.\nSweet Magnolias is created and executive produced by showrunner Sheryl J. Anderson. Executive producers are Sherryl Woods, Dan Paulson, Matt Drake, and Norman Buckley, with Brian J. Johnson serving as its director of photography. The directing lineup includes Lauren Petzke, Christine Swanson, Buckley, JoaAnne Garcie Swisher, and Drake, with Buckley helming four episodes.\n“Come spend the holidays in Serenity, as Season 4 of Sweet Magnolias takes us from Halloween to Christmas, with surprising laughter, unexpected heartbreak, and renewed resolve along the way,” reads the official synopsis. “While negotiating the twists and turns of their romantic lives, Maddie, Dana Sue, and Helen must also navigate the return of old foes, the loss of great loves, and the pain of transition from past dreams to present ones. As the men in their lives pursue their own dreams and the teenagers take uneasy steps toward adulthood, the Magnolias support each other with creative problem-solving, deep-hearted commitment, and — as always — weekly margaritas.”",
