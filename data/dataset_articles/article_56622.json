  "text": "By Dan Zealley ,\n1 hours ago\nBy Dan Zealley\nLike Kirby Smart did at Georgia, Reggie Bush would like to return to USC and guide them to a national championship. After an 11-year NFL career, Bush joined Fox’s Big Noon kickoff in 2019. Now it would seem that he is looking to transition to a coaching career.\n“I actually spoke to some people over at Sacramento State for the head coaching job when that came up,” Bush tells The Sporting Tribune. “I spoke to some people over there about coaching and its definitely something that I want to do. The same way Kirby Smart, a former player from Georgia, came back to coach his team to a title, I would love to do that as well at USC.”\nIn 2005 Bush won the Heisman Trophy after rushing for over 1,700 yards and 16 touchdowns. Following an NCAA investigation for recruiting violations, he was required to give back the trophy and was banned from campus by USC.\nOct 29, 2005; Los Angeles, CA, USA; FILE PHOTO; Southern California Trojans running back Reggie Bush (5) carries the ball against the Washington State Huskies at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Mandatory Credit&colon Peter Brouillet-USA TODAY Sports\nTimes sure have changed in the college sports world in the last few years. The benefits the Bush family received are commonplace now. The Heisman Trust voted in 2024 to give the trophy back to Bush and USC has welcomed him back with open arms. Only time will tell if he will get a chance to lead the Trojans onto the field, again.\n“Lately, man, I’ve just been really having this urge inside of me to get out and coach because it’s in me.” Bush said, “And it’s been something I’ve been thinking about a lot and actually talking to people about.”",
