  "text": "Compulsion Games (known for We Happy Few) and Xbox Game Studios announced the release date for South of Midnight as part of the Developer_Direct event. Third-person adventure coming to Xbox Series X | S and PC already April 8, 2025. Players who purchase the Premium Edition will be able to play 5 days earlier, starting April 3rd. Immediately after release, the standard version of the game will become part of Game Pass.\nSouth of Midnight tells a story set in the landscape of the Deep South. The main character is Hazel, who becomes the Weaver. She will delve into the myths and legends of southern folklore in a dark and wonderful world. The authors of the game presented a new trailer, where they delved into the plot of the game in more detail.\nEarlier, journalists published their previews on South of Midnight, where they noted the excellent visual style of the game and atmosphere. However, many complained about the rather simple and monotonous gameplay.\nLet us remind you that South of Midnight will be the first game from Compulsion Games after the studio’s merger with Microsoft, which occurred in 2018.",
