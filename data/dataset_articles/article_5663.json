  "text": "Edinburg PD Celebrates Historic Crime Reduction and Statewide Recognition\nEdinburg, TX—The Edinburg Police Department is proud to announce a historic milestone for the City of Edinburg. For the first time in more than 30 years, the city has completed a full year with zero homicides. This achievement reflects a continued downward trend in crime and highlights the department’s commitment to proactive policing, community partnerships, and public safety.\nAccording to the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), major crimes across the city decreased by 16 percent, while overall crime dropped by 12 percent compared to 2024. In addition, violent crime in Edinburg has declined by a substantial 37 percent compared to four years ago, underscoring long-term progress in public safety and crime prevention efforts.\nNIBRS data categorizes crime into three primary areas, all of which showed notable reductions. Crimes Against Persons decreased by 15 percent and include offenses such as homicide, kidnapping, assault, aggravated assault, sex offenses, and human trafficking. Crimes Against Property declined by 14 percent and include arson, burglary, motor vehicle theft, shoplifting, fraud, and robbery. Crimes Against Society fell by 5 percent and include drug offenses, weapons law violations, and animal cruelty.\n“These results are a direct reflection of the hard work and dedication of our officers and the strong partnerships we have built with our community,” said Edinburg Police Chief Jaime Ayala. “Reaching a year with zero homicides is a milestone we are extremely proud of, and it reinforces our commitment to keeping Edinburg a safe place to live, work, and play.”\nIn addition to overall crime reductions, the Edinburg Police Department received statewide recognition for its efforts to combat impaired driving. In 2025, the department earned sixth place statewide and first place in the Rio Grande Valley in LEADRS’ Top Performance category, ranking among more than 250 reporting law enforcement agencies across Texas.\nTwo Edinburg Police Department officers were also individually recognized for their outstanding enforcement efforts. Officer Enrique Rodriguez and Officer Javier Ponce placed first and second in the Rio Grande Valley for DWI arrests and earned 14th and 15th place statewide, respectively.\n“Our enforcement efforts, combined with public education and valuable partnerships, are making a real difference,” Chief Ayala said. “I am incredibly proud of our officers for setting the standard and helping make our roads and neighborhoods safer.”\nThe Edinburg Police Department credits these accomplishments to the dedication of its officers, civilian staff, and community partners who work together daily to enhance public safety and quality of life throughout the city.",
