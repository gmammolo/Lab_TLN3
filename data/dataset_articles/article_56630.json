  "text": "This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.\nCakeJerry’s review published on Letterboxd:\nThis review may contain spoilers.\nWent into this movie with low expectations due to the sheer backlash I've seen this movie get. But now that I've watched it, I honestly really enjoyed it. I definitely prefer the series ending being left as it is, but it's still enjoyable as a fanservice reunion movie.\nOf course, the most controversial aspect of the movie is the way it kills off Eiji. On one hand, it feels like a backtrack from him learning to accept help from others instead of taking everything on himself. But on the other, with his renewed desire to save others, in the specific circumstance of him traveling alone, I can see how he would be pushed to sacrifice himself if it was the only way to save someone.\nHowever, the way they execute it at the very end of the movie just felt needlessly harsh. It just slams the movie to a screeching halt in a way that feels like a ploy for shock value, reminding me of a certain shitty Zero-One V-cinema. Thankfully, this movie as a whole is much more enjoyable than that one.\nThe new suit designs really help to carry this movie. The King OOO suit is super rad, as is his upgrade form. The Tajador Eternity suit is gorgeous and has one of the most amazing henshin sequences I've ever seen. But my favorite of the new suits is Birth X. Just a stunning design.\nAt the end of the day, a majority of the movie is just fight scenes and seeing these old characters reunite again, so even with its story flaws, the movie is never boring. Eiji and Ankh's scenes together were as heartfelt and emotional as I could have possibly expected. Tajador Eternity is powered by pure gay love.\nThis movie is the ultimate example of why the endings of Rider seasons are best left as they are, but also of how these fanservice movies can be highly enjoyable when enjoyed for what they are and not regarded as canon.",
