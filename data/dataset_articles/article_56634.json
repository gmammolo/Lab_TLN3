  "text": "Publisher Ubisoft and developers from the Ubisoft Quebec studio presented a story trailer for the pseudo-historical open-world action film Assassin’s Creed Shadows and the first addition to it – Claws of Awaji.\nLet us remind you that the events of Assassin’s Creed Shadows will unfold in the open world of feudal Japan in 1579. There are two main characters – the dexterous and secretive shinobi Naoe, as well as the legendary dark-skinned samurai Yasuke.\nThe two-minute video shows excerpts from the backstories of both heroes and scenes involving minor characters, and also hints at the dramatic development of the main plot.\nFollowing the recent leak, Ubisoft has confirmed plans to release the Claws of Awaji expansion before the end of 2025. After the cancellation of the season pass, the addon became part of the pre-order bonus for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Trailer included.\nThe addon will send players to a mysterious island to experience the fear of a hunted victim. They promise more than 10 hours of content, a new type of weapon (bo staff), equipment and abilities.\nAs for pre-orders, they started (outside Russia) after the release of the story trailer. The standard edition of Assassin’s Creed Shadows sells for $70, and the deluxe edition (with a set of in-game bonuses) sells for $90.\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows will be released on March 20 on PC (Steam, Ubisoft Connect, EGS), Mac (App Store), PS5, Xbox Series X and S. According to rumors, a co-op mode is in development for the game, but you shouldn’t expect it at release.\nIf you notice an error, select it with the mouse and press CTRL+ENTER.",
