  "text": "Charli XCX is continuing her pivot to movies in earnest, announcing today in Variety an upcoming film called The Moment to be created with the indie giant A24.\nThe film is based on an original idea of XCX’s, and will be produced by her company Studio365 — according to Variety , Charli “may also star in the movie.” Aidan Zamiri has been tapped to direct a screenplay co-written by Zamiri and Bertie Brandes. Finally, fans of Charli’s breakout album brat will be pleased to learn that A.G. Cook will compose the film’s score.\nThe Moment is a significant addition to an already stacked IMDB for Charli. She’s slated to appear in an adaptation of Faces of Death , as well as new films from\nRomain Gavras ( Sacrifice ) and Gregg Araki ( I Want Your Sex ). She’ll also write songs for the upcoming A24 pop star film Mother May\nSource link",
