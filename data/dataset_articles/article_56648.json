  "text": "SPARKS, Md. — With just over two weeks to go until the 2025 season, three Cardinal have earned USA Lacrosse DI Women’s Preseason All-America recognition, the organization announced Wednesday.\nAnnabel Frist (second team), Aliya Polisky (third team) and Lucy Pearson (honorable mention) earned spots on the preseason listing of the country’s best players.\nThe trio was no strangers to the spotlight, as all three were also named to the InsideLacrosse.com Top 50 Players For 2025 list in December. Stanford’s three nominees tied North Carolina for the fourth-most in the nation.\nLast season, both Frist and Polisky were named USA Lacrosse All-Americans, as the Cardinal closed out the Pac-12 era as regular season and tournament champions. Both players were also Pac-12 first-team selections and the conference’s Draw Specialist of the Year and Freshman of the Year, respectively.\nPearson was a staple between the pipes for the Cardinal last season, making 139 saves and starting all 18 games en route to being named to the Pac-12 First Team and conference Goalkeeper of the Year.\nStanford begins the 2025 campaign with a pair of matchups against former Pac-12 foes, traveling down to USC for its season opener on Feb. 8 before welcoming Colorado to The Farm on Feb. 13.",
