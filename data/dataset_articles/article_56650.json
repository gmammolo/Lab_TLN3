  "text": "Whether the goal is to hit reset after a holiday of over imbibing, save money, reach new health goals or pave the way for an alcohol-free lifestyle, Dry January, the act of abstaining from alcohol during the first month of the new year, has become a popular pursuit for many. “The origin of Dry January started in 2013 in the UK [United Kingdom] from an organization that wanted to spread awareness about people’s relationship with alcohol,” shares Erika Moore, the co-founder of Whiskey and Rosemary, an Atlanta-based company specializing in craft cocktail and alcohol-free beverage experiences, recipe development and brand partnerships. “It’s just really [about] taking control…It’s important that we stay on the side of us consuming alcohol and not letting it consume us.” Her personal philosophy when approaching Dry January centers on taking a break and noticing patterns. “I think people were actually looking at their relationship with alcohol, but notice they may be over consuming…It’s just more flexibility of drinking when you want to and not drinking when you don’t.” Here, Moore shares some easy Dry January tips to try now or use as a springboard for creating an alcohol-free lifestyle. While Dry January implies avoiding alcohol throughout the month, the professional bartender/recipe developer shares it’s okay to be flexible with the timing. “We can make the decision any day to start Dry January. Don’t be so rigid with yourself. Give yourself grace by starting when it works for you,” offers Moore. “Don’t have too many solid parameters that could push you from actually doing Dry January. For example, if you start on January second and then end after the first day of February, that’s still a month.” “What we focus on grows. Out of sight, out of mind,” observes the Stone Mountain, Georgia native. One of the easiest Dry January tips she offers is to simply put away or remove alcoholic beverages from your home. Place the bottles out of sight and you won’t be tempted. Moore offers, “At home, if you have a bar cart, switch things out. Maybe put some non-alcoholic drinks or soda water there.” Likewise, if you have a bar, try replacing the bottles displayed with some books to fill up that space. MOCKTAIL RECIPE: Floral Sunsets Going out for cocktails with friends or socializing at a bar can be challenging when you’re avoiding alcohol—but not impossible. “When picking a place, look for one that offers a non-alcoholic drinks menu or choose a place that prioritizes guests that are not drinking,” suggests Moore, who recently released her e-book, “Seven Alcohol-Free Beverages For You,” available on the Whiskey and Rosemary website. She also reminds us that it’s good to have a couple of non-alcoholic drink choices ready to order, “Know a few go-to [drinks] that can translate at any bar. An alcohol-free mojito or a margarita mocktail are usually pretty easy to replicate.” Additional Dry January tips include being open to discovering new, non-alcoholic products to enjoy. Businesswoman Moore says to see if your local liquor store has a non-alcoholic section, check out what alcohol-free brands are available, or visit a store specializing in alcohol-free spirits. Two such stores in Moore’s Atlanta hometown are The Zero Co., a non-alcoholic spirits, wine & beer retailer located in the Poncey Highland neighborhood of Atlanta and Soberish, a premier non-alcoholic bottle shop and cannabis boutique (with locations in Atlanta’s Kirkwood neighborhood and Chattahoochee Hills, GA). “So go look and just explore the shelves and grab something that you think you may enjoy. Try new brands,” she encourages. Increased awareness and acceptance of non-alcoholic beverages in the industry have opened up many options to keep your choices exciting. As for specific Dry January-worthy brands to consider, Moore was more than happy to share some of her finds. “One of my favorite non-alcoholic wines is Saint Viviana Cabernet. And Soberish Rosé is pretty good, too. My favorite Champagne-style drink so far is Lyre’s non-alcoholic sparkling wine range.” Moore also gives a shout out to Ghia, a non-alcoholic aperitif and cocktail alternative that comes in four flavors, as another option for spirit-free drinks choices. More Dry January tips from the mixologist include keeping your fridge stocked with something to reach for when the mood to pour a drink strikes. “If you love a drink that can be batched or poured out, try tea or lemonade—anything that you can enjoy instead of maybe having a glass of wine,” offers the mixologist. “I really like tea and it’s a great way to start incorporating nourishing herbs [in your drink].” Milk thistle (to help cleanse the liver) or blending some turmeric with a bit of black pepper with teas are what Moore likes to call “liquid tea stews” for a Dry January treat. “[Dry January] is a great time to do a liver cleanse. Of course, you have to talk to your doctor, or whoever else you need to consult with, before doing that, but it’s a great time to tend to the liver [and] nourish your body,” notes Moore. MOCKTAIL RECIPE : Aura While the Whiskey and Rosemary co-founder’s Dry January tips work great for a month of alcohol abstinence, will they also be effective when extending Dry January into a dry lifestyle? “I think those same tips can extend throughout the year,” affirms Moore. “I’ll also add, continue to be curious about the lifestyle. I think sometimes it can feel like we’re making a big shift in our lives…But it’s more so a shift in perspective. We’re more familiar with alcohol if that’s all we know, but there’s an entire world of non-alcoholic beverages that are coming out.” She cites mindfulness and control over alcohol consumption as what’s spurring the growing popularity of an alcohol-free lifestyle. Moore notes, “People are becoming more aware of different patterns, especially the younger generation like Gen Z. They’re looking more into the effects of everything and there’s so much education and communication about it. I do think a lot of people are still bouncing and indulging, but they’re just being more mindful.” RELATED: Perfectly Cordial Fuels Rhonda Cammon’s Creativity in the Market To successfully navigate and extend the Dry January experience, the seasoned mixologist says it’s important to find a community of like-minded individuals. “Join a community—I know that there’s a Facebook group for everything—or join some type of meetup,” she suggests. “Of course, it’s important not to force our friends or our partners to do things that we’re doing, but just joining or being a part of the community is important.” She says even something as simple as being part of a group text with other people who are engaging and sharing non-alcoholic recipes or honing in on places to enjoy a spirits-free evening is a fun way to build a community to support a dry lifestyle. “If you enjoy exploring different non-alcoholic beverages, allow yourself to deepen your curiosity,” she shares. “Do what works for you and have fun with it.” After all, it’s the fun that will help keep you on the right track to conquer the Dry January challenge now successfully…or whenever you choose to dry out your beverage experience.
