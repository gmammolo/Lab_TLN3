I feel truly lucky to be a part of your life and to witness this moment that you've created for yourself (sic).'She added, 'From Bilaspur to Mumbai - what a journey it's been! You've built everything with your own hard work, faith, and perseverance. I'm sure this moment feels surreal, knowing that it's all the result of your dedication and belief in yourself. Wherever life takes you, always remember where you started from-stay grounded, stay humble, and never forget the people who stood by you when you had nothing but dreams and determination.'\" } window.getccpaCookie = (cookieName) => { var cookieArray = document.cookie.split('; ').find(row => row.startsWith(cookieName)); return cookieArray && cookieArray.split('=')[1]; } (function(){ let dsmiparam = \"",
