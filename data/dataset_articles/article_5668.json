  "text": "On November 6, 2025, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), Ahmedabad bench removed the income additions made by the tax department to Mr. Gupta’s income towards deemed rent for five of his vacant properties in Mumbai. The ITAT Ahmedabad pointed out that if someone holds a property with the intention of renting it out to earn income, but despite best efforts, can’t make it happen then the tax department can’t impose deemed rent charges,Brief facts of this caseThe key details of this case are that Mr. Gupta filed his Income Tax Returns (ITRs) on October 2, 2011 for AY2021–22, reporting a total income of Rs 10 crore (10,60,37,350). However, his case was flagged for scrutiny under CASS owing to large deductions/exemptions claimed under Sections 54, 54B, 54EC, 54EE, 54F, 54G, 54GA and 54GB of the Income Tax Act, 1961.During the assessment process, the income tax Assessing Officer (AO) passed an order assessing the total income at Rs 11 crore (11,02,69,810) as against the ITR declared income of Rs 10 crore (10,60,37,350). The additions made by the AO included (i) Rs 21 lakh (21,03,258) under the head “Long-term Capital Gain”, (ii) Rs 7 lakh (7,43,199) as deemed rent on five flats situated at Mumbai, and (iii) Rs 13 lakh (13,86,000) as deemed rent on office premises claimed as self-occupied.Regarding the first addition concerning the deemed rental income of Rs 7 lakh (7,43,199) , Mr. Gupta owned five flats in Mumbai which were neither let out nor shown as self-occupied during the relevant year. He had previously offered deemed rent on these flats in earlier years; however, for the year under consideration, he reported nil deemed rent under Section 23(1)(c), claiming that the flats were intended to be let out but remained vacant due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and were eventually sold during the year. The tax officer rejected Mr. Gupta’s explanation on the ground that no evidence of efforts to let out the flats was furnished, and that the flats had remained vacant from F.Y. 2018–19 to F.Y. 2020–21. The tax officer had accordingly computed deemed rental income of Rs 7 lakh (7,43,199) and added that to the total income. Aggrieved with the tax department’s order, Mr.Gupta appealed to CIT (A). He told CIT (A) that he indeed made efforts to rent out the flats through brokers but could not produce any proof as these were not preserved after the sale of the flats. Mr. Gupta’s chartered accountant J. C. Desai relied on judicial precedents including Premsudha Exports (P.) Ltd. v. ACIT [(2008) 110 ITD 158 (Mum.) / 17 SOT 293] and Shri Sachin R. Tendulkar v. DCIT [ITA No. 3755/Mum/2016, order dated 09.02.2018], to argue that the benefit of Section 23(1)(c) applies even if the property, held with an intention to let out, remains vacant for the whole or part of the year. The CIT(A), however, noted that no corroborative material was filed either before the AO or during the appellate proceedings to substantiate the claim of such efforts. It was also noted that Mr. Gupta himself admitted that the confirmations from brokers were not available. The CIT(A), therefore, held that Mr. Gupta failed to discharge the onus to establish the intention to let out the property and consequently upheld the tax officer’s addition of Rs 7,43,199, dismissing ground no. 1 of the appeal. Ground number 2 and 3 were also dismissed and ultimately CIT (A) sustained the additions made on account of deemed rental income of Rs 7,43,199 and Rs 13,86,000 against which Mr. Gupta filed an appeal before the ITAT Ahmedabad. On November 6, 2025 he won the case.Also read: Tenants sold property bought from landlord’s wife on the basis of a Will, son raised disputes against Will; Delhi HC stays property sale till final trialWhy did he win the case?Chartered Accountant Suresh Surana said to ET Wealth Online: \\\"In the given case (ITA No.1091/Ahd/2025), the taxpayer owned five residential flats in Mumbai that had historically been offered to tax on a deemed-rent basis.\\\"For the relevant Assessment Year (AY 2021–22), the taxpayer reported Nil annual value under section 23(1)(c) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 , on the ground that although the flats were intended to be let out, they remained vacant despite bona fide efforts during the COVID-19 period and were ultimately sold within the same year. The Assessing Officer denied the benefit of section 23(1)(c) alleging absence of documentary evidence of attempts to let out the property, and computed deemed rent. The CIT(A) upheld this view. The matter came before the Ahmedabad ITAT.Surana says: \\\"The ITAT held in favour of the taxpayer, observing that section 23(1)(c) expressly grants relief where a property remains vacant for the whole or part of the year despite genuine efforts to let it out.\\\"According to Surana, the Tribunal emphasised that actual letting is not a prerequisite and what matters is the taxpayer’s intention and bona fide efforts, as recognised in earlier judicial precedents such as Sachin R. Tendulkar v. DCIT and Premsudha Exports (P.) Ltd.The Tribunal found that the taxpayer had consistently offered deemed rent in earlier years, had engaged brokers for letting out the flats, and that the sale of the flats within the same year corroborated ongoing broker engagement. ITAT held that the absence of written broker confirmations cannot be a basis for denying relief, since maintaining infallible records of informal broker interactions is not consistent with normal human conduct. Accordingly, the ITAT concluded that the conditions of section 23(1)(c) were satisfied, and the addition of deemed rent of Rs. 7,43,199 was unsustainable in law and liable to be deleted.Also read: Tenant can’t tell landlord which property to use: Supreme Court restores eviction orderWhat does deemed rent provisions say?Surana says that in the context of the present judgment, the deemed rent provisions under section 23 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 are central to determining whether notional rental income can be brought to tax when a property is not actually let out.Specifically, section 23(1)(a) provides that the “annual value” of a property shall be the amount for which the property might reasonably be expected to be let from year to year, thereby enabling taxation of notional rent even where no actual rent is received.According to Surana, Section 23(1)(c) carves out an important exception: where a property that is intended to be let out remains vacant for the whole or part of the previous year, and due to such vacancy the actual rent received or receivable is less than the value determined under section 23(1)(a), the actual rent received or receivable, including a situation where it is Nil, shall be taken as the annual value. Surana says: \\\"This provision effectively grants relief from deemed rent where the taxpayer demonstrates a bona fide intention to let out the property, coupled with genuine efforts to locate tenants, but is unable to do so for reasons beyond his control.\\\"ITAT Ahmedabad analysis and discussionITAT Ahmedabad in its judgement (ITA No.1091/Ahd/2025 ) dated November 6, 2025, said that insofar as Ground No. 1 relating to deemed rent on the five vacant flats at Mumbai is concerned, it is an admitted fact that Mr. Gupta was the owner of five flats which were intended to be let out but remained vacant during the year due to the unprecedented situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic and were subsequently sold during the year itself. Mr. Gupta had duly offered deemed rental income on the said flats in earlier years, but for the year under appeal, determined the annual value as Nil under Section 23(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, on the ground that the properties, though intended to be let out, remained vacant despite bona fide efforts made to rent them out. ITAT Ahmedabad said that the authorities below have rejected Mr. Gupta’s claim, merely on the basis that no formal evidence or confirmation from brokers was produced. ITAT said: “In our considered opinion, the denial of benefit under Section 23(1)(c) to the assessee (Mr. Gupta) is not justified. The said provision provides that where the property remains vacant for the whole or part of the year despite efforts to let it out, the annual value shall be the actual rent received or receivable, which in this case is Nil.”ITAT Ahmedabad said that a coordinate bench of ITAT Ahmedabad in the judgement Shri Sachin R. Tendulkar v. DCIT-23(3), ITA No. 3755/Mum/2016 (order dated 09.02.2018), has held that the expression “property is let” in Section 23(1)(c) includes cases where the property is held with an intention to let out and efforts are made, though unsuccessfully. The Tribunal further observed that the expectation that an assessee should maintain infallible records of efforts made to let out the property is unrealistic and contrary to normal human conduct. A similar view was taken in Premsudha Exports (P.) Ltd. v. ACIT [(2008) 110 ITD 158 (Mum.) / 17 SOT 293], wherein it was held that if a property is held with an intention to let out and remains vacant despite efforts, the benefit of Section 23(1)(c) cannot be denied merely because the letting out did not materialize.ITAT Ahmedabad said that in the present case, Mr. Gupta has explained that mandates were given to brokers for renting out the flats, but due to the pandemic and the subsequent sale of the properties, confirmations could not be preserved or traced. ITAT Ahmedabad said: “The explanation is plausible and in line with the commercial reality of the situation and also in light of the fact that the properties in question were sold during the impugned year under consideration, which supports the fact that the assessee was in touch with the brokers.”Thus the ITAT Ahmedabad said that they find merit in the submissions of Mr..Gupta that the intention to let out and the bona fide efforts made are sufficient to attract the provisions of section 23(1)(c). ITAT Ahmedabad said: “Accordingly, we hold that the addition made by the Assessing Officer and confirmed by the learned CIT(A) towards deemed rent of Rs 7,43,199 in respect of five flats at Mumbai is unsustainable in law. The same is hereby directed to be deleted. Hence, Ground No. 1 of the assessee’s appeal stands allowed.”ITAT Ahmedabad says this about the vacant commercial property in MumbaiITAT Ahmedabad said that with respect to the ground no.2, relating to deemed rent on the office premises at Andheri (West), they find that Mr. Gupta had claimed tax exemption from notional rent under Section 22 on the ground that the premises were used as an office to manage his investments in shares and securities. ITAT Ahmedabad said that however, as noted by the CIT(A), Mr. Gupta was not carrying on any business or profession with income chargeable under that head, and his income was assessable under other heads. Section 22 exempts from tax the annual value of property used for the purposes of business or profession, the profits of which are chargeable to income tax. ITAT Ahmedabad said: “In the instant case, there is no material on record to establish that the assessee was carrying on any organized business or professional activity in relation to his investment operations. Hence, we find no infirmity in the conclusion drawn by the learned CIT(A) in upholding the addition on this count. Accordingly, Ground No. 2 of the assessee’s appeal is dismissed.”The ITAT Ahmedabad said that with regard to ground No. 3, which is raised in the alternative, Mr. Gupta contends that even if the office premises at Andheri (West) are considered chargeable to tax under the head “Income from House Property,” the same ought to be treated as one of the two self-occupied properties, and the property at Ruby Villa, Indore, should be treated as deemed let out. The CIT(A) has rejected this contention observing that such an option can be exercised only at the time of filing the ITR. ITAT Ahmedabad said: “We find merit in the alternative contention of the assessee.” ITAT Ahmedabad said that a coordinate bench of the Tribunal in Asha Bhonsle v. ITO (ITA No. 2552/Mum/2010, order dated 21.09.2011) has categorically held that the assessee is entitled to modify the option for choosing a self-occupied property even during the course of assessment proceedings. The Tribunal, after examining the provisions of Section 23(4), held that when an assessee has exercised an option which is not beneficial and subsequently during the assessment seeks to substitute another property as self-occupied, such a claim should be allowed. The Tribunal in that case relied on the decision of the Hon’ble Bombay High Court in Balmukund Acharya v. DCIT [(2009) 310 ITR 310 (Bom)] to hold that the Assessing Officer should not take advantage of an assessee’s ignorance of law and that beneficial interpretation should be given to the taxpayer where permissible. Thus the ITAT Ahmedabad said that following the ratio laid down by the coordinate bench in Asha Bhonsle v. ITO, they hold that Mr. Gupta is entitled to exercise the option of treating the office premises at Andheri (West) as self-occupied property and to offer deemed rent in respect of the property at Ruby Villa, Indore, accordingly. ITAT Ahmedabad said: “The Assessing Officer is directed to recompute the income from house property on this basis. Hence, Ground No. 3 of the assessee’s appeal is allowed.”ITAT Ahmedabad judgement: “In the result, the appeal of the assessee is partly allowed, Ground No. 1 and Ground No. 3 being allowed, and Ground No. 2 being dismissed. Order pronounced in the Open Court on 06 /11/2025 at Ahmedabad.”",
