  "title": "New Year straw rope production keeps elderly workers busy near Tokyo",
  "text": "Elderly residents in a city northeast of Tokyo are busy making straw rope decorations in preparation for the New Year.\nTen people in their 70s gathered on Wednesday at a job center for the elderly in Hitachiota City, Ibaraki Prefecture. They put together gigantic ropes that are displayed at shrines to mark the boundary of a sacred place.\nThe workers completed a thick twisted rope more than 50 meters long by weaving thin bundles of rice straw.\nThey also made small decorations for home use by adding \"daidai\" oranges symbolizing family prosperity and \"nanten\" berries as a good luck charm.\nThe Hitachiota center receives orders for the New Year decorations from shrines and businesses across the nation.\nCenter officials say orders have been on the rise in recent years as the number of people who make such decorations is decreasing in Japan.\nThey say they received nearly 4,000 orders this year, and started production one month earlier than usual.\nThe head of the center, Komuro Tadahisa, says workers are making the decorations with all their hearts, wishing that many people will be able to have a happy New Year.\nThe rope-making is expected to continue through late December.",
