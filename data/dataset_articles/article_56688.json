  "text": "By Shazmeen Navrange ,\n39 minutes ago Photo by Stewart Cook/A24 via Getty Images Dwayne Johnson impressively caught a fly in one attempt during an ongoing interview alongside Emily Blunt and Benny Safdie for The Smashing Machine. As they were praising Safdie for his directing skills, a fly interrupted Blunt’s conversation. However, Johnson instantly saved the day, which Blunt acknowledged before continuing to share some kind words about Safdie.\nWatch Dwayne Johnson catch a fly to protect Emily Blunt In an interview with Variety , Johnson and Blunt praised Safdie’s directing skills while also promoting their new movie, The Smashing Machine. A fly interrupts Blunt’s conversation, with her trying to shoo it away. Apologising for her inconvenient actions, she said, “Sorry, there’s a fly that is. I’m so sorry to interrupt you waxing poetic.”\nAt the same time, Johnson catches the fly effortlessly. Acknowledging his catch, Blunt said, “That’s it. You got it. Keep going.” They continued their praise for Safdie, with Blunt describing him as “a rarefied air kind of director.” Johnson agrees with Blunt’s words, and Safdie thanks the duo for their kind words.\nThis biographical sports drama movie centers around the true story of Mark Kerr, a former amateur wrestler and MMA fighter. It highlights the highs and lows of the UFC champion. The film originally premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September 2025. It came out in US theaters on October 3, 2025. It turned out to be a financial disappointment at the box office, earning approximately only $20.2 million worldwide on a budget of $50 million.\nDuring the same discussion, Blunt spoke about the decline in theatrical viewership, acknowledging that it’s natural that audiences can’t be forced to watch any specific movie without a good story. She said, “A film like this that defies the curation system makes me so proud. I know it is getting rarer and rarer. You can’t persuade people to go see a movie anymore without a great story. I think word of mouth will be really exciting, and I hope that it can stretch out and many people can experience it.”\nThe post appeared first on .",
