  "text": "DUBAI- Beond Airlines (B4), the Dubai-headquartered boutique carrier, has introduced a surprising adjustment to its route network by routing its existing service between Malé (MLE) and Milan Malpensa Airport (MXP) via Red Sea International Airport (RSI) in Saudi Arabia.\nIn doing so, the carrier is replacing the previous stop at Dubai World Central (DWC). This shift marks the first time the airline offers a European connection via the Red Sea destination.\nBeond Airline Red Sea Stop\nHistorically, Beond’s service from Malé to Milan operated via Dubai with flight numbers B4080/81: Malé→Dubai departing 11:30 & arriving 15:05, then Dubai→Milan at 15:50 arriving 20:20. Return flights Milan→Dubai arrived 06:50 the next day, and Dubai→Malé departed 07:35 arriving 01:05.\nWith immediate effect, the route is adjusted as follows:\n- B4080: Malé (MLE) departs 12:15, arrives Red Sea (RSI) 17:15, then RSI→Milan (MXP) departs 18:00, arrives 21:20.\n- B4081: Milan departs 22:20, arrives RSI 05:00 (+1), then RSI→Malé departs 05:45, arriving 14:05 (+1).\nThe change adds approximately 100 miles in each direction and grants the carrier pick-up and drop-off rights between both Milan-RSI and RSI-Malé pairs, meaning passengers may now travel exclusively between Milan and Red Sea, or exclusively between Red Sea and Malé, on B4’s service.\nStrategic Implications\nBeond launched its commercial operations in 2023 and describes itself as the “world’s first premium leisure airline.” Its primary business revolves around flights to and from the Maldives, yet the carrier has frequently paused scheduled operations for weeks at a time and remains opaque about its longer-term strategy.\nEarlier this year, the airline claimed it would add 18 new destinations in 2025-26, even though no additional aircraft orders are publicly known, and so far none of those routes have materialised.\nThe move aligns neatly with Saudi Arabia’s ambition to elevate its Red Sea coastline as a high-end tourism destination, and adding a European long-haul link enhances connectivity for that aim. This appears to be the first scheduled European-RSI service, as reported by One Mile at a Time.\nHowever, the adjustment also raises questions about the airline’s broader commercial rationale. Given the carrier’s track record of intermittent operations and unfulfilled expansion promises — such as the 18-route announcement earlier this year that remains unseen — observers may view this change as more opportunistic than strategically coherent.\nOutlook for Expansion\nBeond’s service change comes at a time when its expansion plans appear stalled. While the carrier last spring publicised 18 new destinations to launch in 2025-26, no new aircraft orders have been disclosed, and none of the announced routes have so far been activated.\nThe company’s fleet is modest and growth pace remains unclear.\nFor aviation watchers and travellers alike the new Milan-Red Sea‐Malé routing is intriguing, but it may be less about building long-haul network depth than about leveraging emerging tourism-growth regions and accessing incentives.\nWhether this marks a first step into a broader Red Sea strategy—or a one-off quirk—remains to be seen.\nBottom Line\nBeond’s routing switch for its Malé-Milan service, bypassing Dubai in favour of Red Sea, marks a noteworthy twist in its otherwise erratic expansion narrative.\nWhile the move offers a new European link to Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea development and affords the airline greater pick-up flexibility, it also underscores uncertainties about the carrier’s strategic path and growth commitment.\nFor now, passengers benefit from a novel routing—but the bigger picture remains clouded by questions about future execution and fleet capability.\nStay tuned with us.
