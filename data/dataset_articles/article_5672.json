  "text": "Another juvenile probation agency selects SuperCom to replace incumbent technology provider, underscoring rapid expansion momentum\nSuperCom Ltd. (NASDAQ:SPCB)\nTEL AVIV, ISRAEL, January 12, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — SuperCom Ltd. (NASDAQ: SPCB), a global provider of secure solutions for the e-Government, IoT, and Cybersecurity sectors, announced today that it has secured a new electronic monitoring (EM) contract with another juvenile probation agency in the state of Texas. This award represents SuperCom’s second contract win in Texas, following its initial entry into the state announced last month, and highlights the company’s ability to scale quickly within newly entered U.S. markets.\nSuperCom (NASDAQ: SPCB) is a B2i Digital Featured Company. See the comprehensive profile at https://b2idigital.com/supercom-1\nUnder the agreement, the agency selected SuperCom to fully replace its incumbent electronic monitoring technology provider and modernize its offender supervision capabilities. The deployment will utilize SuperCom’s GPS tracking solution and proprietary monitoring platform to modernize juvenile supervision programs with enhanced reliability, accuracy, and operational efficiency. The contract follows a simple recurring revenue model based on active daily units.\n“Winning a second juvenile probation contract in Texas within weeks of entering the state reinforces the expansion pattern we are executing across the U.S.,” said Ordan Trabelsi, President and CEO of SuperCom. “Once we enter a new state, local agencies are increasingly selecting our platform, transitioning away from legacy systems and adopting our advanced technology solutions that can scale quickly and reliably.”\n“Our continued expansion is supported by a strong operational foundation, including a widening base of recurring revenue, a broad partner ecosystem, and record financial performance, with $6.0 million in net income and EBITDA margins exceeding 35% in the first nine months of 2025,” Trabelsi added. “Recent national wins in Europe, including the tenth country to adopt our domestic violence monitoring technology after 15 other national EM projects won, reflect the global demand for our solutions. Combined with our expansion into 16 U.S. states and over 35 new contracts secured since mid-2024, we believe we are well-positioned to drive sustained expansion across both existing and new markets,” Trabelsi concluded.\nAbout SuperCom\nSince 1988, SuperCom has been a global provider of traditional and digital identity solutions, providing advanced safety, identification, and security solutions to governments and organizations, both private and public, worldwide. Through its proprietary e-Government platforms and innovative solutions for traditional and biometrics enrollment, personalization, issuance, and border control services, SuperCom has inspired governments and national agencies to design and issue secure Multi-ID documents and robust digital identity solutions to its citizens and visitors.
