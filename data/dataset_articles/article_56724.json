  "text": "Key Takeaways\nPlan a groom shower with activities your fiancé loves, like cooking, sports, or a game night.\nConsider a themed groom shower, such as a tasting tour or a trip to their favorite barcade.\nA groom shower can include thoughtful gifts, like grilling tools, bar essentials, or handy power tools.\nSometimes, it seems like brides have all the fun. In addition to bachelorette parties, they’re whisked away for showers and bridesmaid luncheons—really racking up the party points. If your partner wishes they had more reasons to celebrate before your wedding, we’ve got an idea: the groom shower. But how is it different from a bachelor party? First, it's a lot tamer. Instead of the debauchery that bachelor parties might include, a groom shower is a little more family-friendly, meaning your groom can invite their dad, uncles, and even grandfather to attend without worrying. Second? Gifts. Just like a bridal shower, a groom's party is a themed opportunity for guests to give gifts that are more specific to the groom-to-be. Here are 12 bro-dal shower ideas to help your partner get in on the fun.\nGrill the Groom\nDoes your groom love to cook? If so, use the shower as a chance to ask for those gadgets and tools they've always wanted. It could be a new set of grilling tools (or a group gift of a brand-new grill), fancy Japanese knives, or the pressure cooker they've been eying. Other guests might turn to their favorite cookbooks, stocking your shelves with recipes and inspiration the groom will love. To keep with the theme, have the event be a backyard barbecue with yard games.\nTake Tasting Tour\nWhether the groom is a craft beer aficionado, can pick a Merlot from a Cabernet just by looking at the glass, or is all about fine whiskey, there’s a tasting tour they'll love. Find a local brewery or distillery that offers tours and guided tastings or plan a weekend trip that revolves around specific producers. A chartered van or party bus is a must, as is a serious spread of snacks. Think bread and cheese for a day of wine tasting; cured meats and pretzels with beer; or a mix of dried fruits, roasted nuts, and dark chocolate with whiskey.\nKeep Score\nEveryone has a competitive side, so why not take advantage of it and plan the ultimate groom’s game night? Gather up the groom’s favorite group games (we love Scategories, Pictionary, and Cards Against Humanity) and invite over a crowd. Split into teams for a round of intense trivia, or make it an every-man-for-himself evening. Set up a scoreboard (as well as a bar and lots of finger food) to track points, and don’t forget to have a few prizes for the winners.\nRoot for the Home Team\nA sports-loving groom will love a shower that’s geared toward their favorite pastime. Instead of gifts, ask guests to chip in for box seats (or better yet, a row on the 50-yard line) for a home game at their favorite stadium. Can’t swing the tickets? Turn your living room or another space into a total man cave for the ultimate viewing party with the groom’s favorite food and drinks. If you have space, organize a friendly game of H.O.R.S.E. or flag football during halftime.\nHit the Barcade\nDid you ever hit the arcade as a kid and go crazy over those prize tickets? For a more mature take on the arcade, plan a party at an awesome barcade (or a family-friendly version of one), some of which can actually be rented out for large groups. This way, all can attend and have a great time, but you can still buy a few beers while channeling your inner kid with Pac-Man and ski-ball.\nBuild a Bar\nNo, this isn’t the next hot show on HGTV! A build-a-bar party is, instead, a chance for the groom’s friends to stock the bar for your new home (did we mention that some of these ideas will be good for you, too?). There are a few ways to make it work. The first: Ask each guest to bring a specific type of alcohol and accouterments, from a bottle of Champagne and an ice bucket to whiskey and whiskey stones. The second: Set up a bar-specific registry and ask guests to choose from wine glasses, fancy bottle openers, cocktail shakers, and, of course, bottles.\nPlay a Round\nCan't pull your partner off the green? Then let them enjoy a whole day of what is easily the male version of a spa day. A golf outing is the perfect shower idea for a bunch of bros looking to drink and indulge in some laid-back competition—or just light-hearted trash talking. Set up a tab for everyone to enjoy themselves on the course followed by a catered lunch at the clubhouse where a shower of golf-related gifts await.\nGamble on a Poker Night\nNothing says \"male bonding\" like a poker night! One of the groom's best friends can host a poker party, which can be as family-friendly or adults-only as they please. Of course, all their favorite food and beverages will be served, and some hand-rolled cigars wouldn't hurt either.\nFill the Shed\nIf your groom is handy, swap a bridal shower’s kitchenware and linens with power tools and call it a \"Fill the Shed\" or \"Stock the Garage\" party. Some home improvement stores, like Home Depot, have their own registries, or you can use a universal registry like Zola to gather whatever he’s eyeing in one place. Look for tool lines that have multi-use battery packs or other compatible attachments to really outfit the garage in a useful way. This is also a great opportunity to set up a cash registry for renovations or a down payment.\nTo remind everyone the groom is getting married, ask each guest to bring their favorite tool for marriage—tried-and-true advice—along with their gift.\nGo Fishing\nThere's nothing like a classic fishing trip to bring friends and family together. If it's the right season, your groom and their guests can go out on the lake or ocean and try to reel 'em in. The best part about a fishing trip is that it's appropriate for all ages, and it doesn't lend itself to hard-partying. At the day's end, the groom's best man can host a fish fry with all the attendees.\nLaugh It Off\nIs your groom a huge stand-up comedy or improv fan? Then there's no better place to celebrate than a comedy club. Choose a place they frequent, or, if luck strikes, get tickets to see their favorite stand-up comedian live. Whoever throws the shower can reserve a dinner at a nearby restaurant where younger family members can be present and the groom can receive gifts. Then all the older guests can hit the show.\nGet Thematic\nWhat better way to celebrate the groom than with a party centered around something they love? Shower theme ideas can come from so many places: Whether it’s their favorite destination, movie, or book series, turn to one of their passions (or obsessions) for your inspiration. Tie the décor, menu, and activities into the theme. That could be red wine, cheese, and pastries if they always have Paris on the mind; tater tots and friendship bracelets if they can quote every line of Napoleon Dynamite; or all the trappings of a murder mystery party if they're more of a John Grisham type.\nIf you and your partner would rather celebrate your engagement and get showered with gifts together, you might consider having a coed wedding shower.
