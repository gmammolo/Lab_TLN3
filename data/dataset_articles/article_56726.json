  "text": "Key Takeaways\nChoose a song like \"All of Me\" or \"Marry Me\" that captures the love and emotion of the moment.\nConsider selecting a tune you both cherish to make the proposal unforgettable and personal for you both.\nInclude proposal songs in your wedding playlist to create a meaningful musical journey from engagement to marriage.\nThere are countless different ways to pop the question, but no matter how you do it, one thing is for certain: No proposal is complete without the perfect song playing in the background. Music has the power to instantly personalize a moment and romanticize a gesture (the formula for a one-of-a-kind proposal, right?). That's why one study analyzed over 60 Spotify proposal playlists to determine the 10 most popular engagement tunes of the moment. You probably won't be surprised by the tracks that made the list—we've even dubbed a few of them as some of the most romantic songs of all time.\nHowever, while these are the most frequently played songs during engagements, you definitely aren't limited to this list. We recommend considering your favorite song as a couple or a tune that literally sings how you feel as the background music for such an exciting moment.\nUse your proposal song for your first dance at your wedding for a full circle moment.\nReady to pop the question? Here are the top 10 songs to propose to, according to Spotify.\n\"All of Me,\" by John Legend\nLyrics of Love: \"'Cause all of me/Loves all of you/Love your curves and all your edges/All your perfect imperfections/Give your all to me/I'll give my all to you/You're my end and my beginning\"\n\"Perfect,\" by Ed Sheeran\nLyrics of Love: \"When I saw you in that dress/Looking so beautiful/I don't deserve this/Darling, you look perfect tonight\"\n\"Thinking Out Loud,\" by Ed Sheeran\nLyrics of Love: \"Oh me I fall in love with you every single day/And I just wanna tell you I am/So honey now/Take me into your loving arms/Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars\"\n\"A Thousand Years,\" by Christina Perri\nLyrics of Love: \"I have died every day, waiting for you/Darling, don't be afraid/I have loved you for a thousand years/I'll love you for a thousand more\"\n\"Make You Feel My Love,\" by Adele\nLyrics of Love: \"I could make you happy/Make your dreams come true/Nothing that I wouldn't do/Go to the ends of the earth for you/To make you feel my love\"\n\"Marry You,\" by Bruno Mars\nLyrics of Love: \"'Cause it's a beautiful night/we're looking for something dumb to do/Hey baby/I think I wanna marry you/Is it the look in your eyes/Or is it this dancing juice/Who cares baby/I think I wanna marry you\"\n\"Marry Me,\" by Train\nLyrics of Love: \"You wear white and I'll wear out the words I love you/And you're beautiful/Now that the wait is over/And love and has finally shown her my way/Marry me/Today and every day\"\n\"On Bended Knee,\" by Boyz II Men\nLyrics of Love: \"Oh God give me a reason/I'm down on bended knee/I'll never walk again/Until you come back to me/I'm down on bended knee\"\n\"Just Say Yes,\" by Snow Patrol\nLyrics of Love: \"Just say yes/Just say there's nothing holding you back/It's not a test/Nor a trick of the mind/Only love\"\n\"I Swear,\" by All-4-One\nLyrics of Love: \"For better or worse/Till death do us part/I'll love you with every beat of my heart/And I swear/I'll give you every thing I can\"",
