  "text": "Next Article\nColorful salads to supercharge your immunity naturally\nVinita Jain\nWhat's the story\nEating a plant-based diet can do wonders for your immunity, especially if you add some colorful salads to the mix. These salads are loaded with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that can help boost your immune system. They are also easy to make and can be customized according to your taste. Here are five colorful salads that can help you boost immunity with a plant-based diet.\nTip 1\nBeetroot and citrus salad\nBeetroot and citrus salad is a delicious combination of beets, oranges, and spinach. Beetroot is rich in vitamin C and folate, which are essential for immune function. Oranges add an extra dose of vitamin C, while spinach provides iron and antioxidants. This salad not only boosts immunity but also offers a vibrant color to your plate.\nTip 2\nKale and pomegranate salad\nKale is one of the most nutrient-dense leafy greens you can have. It is rich in vitamins A, C, and K, which are all important for the immune system. Pomegranate seeds add a sweet crunch and are packed with antioxidants that protect cells from damage. This salad is a powerhouse of nutrients that promote overall health.\nTip 3\nCarrot and ginger salad\nCarrots are rich in beta-carotene, which turns into vitamin A in the body. Vitamin A is important for keeping the mucous membranes healthy, which is important for keeping infections at bay. Ginger adds flavor and has anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce inflammation in the body. This refreshing salad is perfect for boosting immunity naturally.\nTip 4\nBell pepper quinoa salad\nBell peppers are loaded with vitamin C, even more than oranges. They also provide fiber that aids digestion and supports gut health—an important factor in immunity. When paired with quinoa, which is high in protein and essential amino acids, this salad becomes a complete meal option that nourishes the body while enhancing its defense mechanisms.\nTip 5\nTomato avocado salad\nTomatoes are rich in lycopene, an antioxidant that protects cells from free radical damage. Avocados provide healthy fats that help absorb fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin E, which is crucial for immune health. This simple yet flavorful salad combines the best of both worlds, taste and nutrition, to keep you healthy all year round.",
