  "text": "The third Vietnam-Japan International Conference, held in Hanoi under the theme “Creative Tourism – Developing Sustainable Destinations,” marks a significant step in strengthening the bilateral ties between the two nations through tourism. This event highlighted the growing importance of creative tourism, where travelers actively engage with local cultures, blending sustainability with cultural preservation. Both Vietnam and Japan have committed to using tourism not just as an economic tool but as a means of enriching communities, preserving traditions, and ensuring long-term cultural sustainability. With shared goals of enhancing cultural exchange, integrating advanced technology, and fostering community empowerment, the conference laid the groundwork for a future where creative tourism is a vital force driving both economic growth and cultural resilience. Through initiatives like joint research, human resource development, and innovative tourism products, the partnership between Vietnam and Japan aims to redefine the travel experience for future generations, promoting a tourism model that is both authentic and socially responsible.\nVietnam and Japan Strengthen Ties in Creative Tourism for Sustainable Growth Advertisement HANOI – The third Vietnam-Japan International Conference, co-hosted by the Vietnam Institute of Culture, Arts, Sports and Tourism (VICAS) and the Japan Transport and Tourism Research Institute (JTTRI), unfolded in Hanoi under the theme of “Creative Tourism – Developing Sustainable Destinations.” The event spotlighted creative tourism’s growing significance as both nations aim to merge sustainability with tourism development, shaping the future of travel in the region.\nHeld with an emphasis on fostering bilateral ties, the conference brought together policymakers, researchers, tourism professionals, and cultural organisations. These key stakeholders engaged in discussions on how creative tourism can evolve and play a vital role in shaping the next generation of travel. The event revealed a collective ambition to use tourism not just as a means of income but as a tool for cultural preservation and community empowerment. Creative Tourism: A Global Movement\nDuring the opening address, Associate Professor Nguyen Thi Thu Phuong, Director of VICAS, highlighted the transformative nature of creative tourism. She noted that it has transcended conventional travel experiences, with tourists becoming active participants rather than passive observers. Travelers now seek to co-create experiences with local communities, exploring destinations through the lens of cultural exchange and authenticity.\nPhuong underscored the potential of Vietnam’s rich cultural heritage as a catalyst for developing a tourism model that blends sustainability with cultural identity. From traditional arts and crafts to Vietnam’s renowned culinary practices and vibrant festivals, the country has a wealth of resources to create tourism products that reflect its deep-rooted cultural traditions. This approach, she explained, not only enhances the visitor experience but also generates economic opportunities for local communities, contributing to the preservation of age-old practices and traditions. Advertisement In his speech, Director General Nguyen Trung Khanh of the Vietnam National Authority of Tourism discussed the blossoming Vietnam-Japan tourism relationship. Japan has long been one of Vietnam’s top ten international visitor markets. Japanese tourists are drawn to Vietnam’s diverse cultural offerings, from its historical landmarks to its beautiful landscapes. Similarly, Vietnamese tourists find themselves captivated by Japan’s seamless blend of ancient traditions and cutting-edge modernity.\nThis mutual attraction has laid a solid foundation for further cooperation between the two nations, particularly in tourism. The conference addressed several key areas of collaboration, including joint research initiatives, human resource development programs, and the creation of innovative tourism products. These initiatives aim to promote sustainability in tourism, ensuring that both countries can continue to evolve in line with the demands of the modern traveler while retaining their cultural authenticity. Cultural Experiences and Technology in Tourism\nJTTRI President Okuda Tetsuya praised Vietnam’s tourism strategies that prioritise cultural immersion. He pointed out that integrating arts, crafts, and local cuisine into tourism experiences does more than attract tourists—it supports local artisans, chefs, and performers, thus contributing to community development. According to Tetsuya, this model of tourism empowers local economies and preserves valuable cultural practices that might otherwise fade.\nHe also highlighted Japan’s commitment to sharing its experiences in community-based tourism, heritage conservation, and the integration of advanced technologies to enhance visitor engagement. From using digital platforms for destination promotion to incorporating augmented reality (AR) for more immersive cultural experiences, Japan’s technological expertise is seen as an invaluable resource for Vietnam as it continues to innovate in the creative tourism sector. Strengthening Bilateral Cooperation\nThe conference concluded with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), solidifying the commitment of both nations to foster creative tourism. The MoU aims to enhance bilateral cooperation in areas such as joint research, the exchange of tourism experts, and the development of best practices in creative tourism. By focusing on the development of sustainable and innovative tourism models, the agreement will help both Vietnam and Japan cultivate a new era of tourism that is not only economically beneficial but also socially responsible and culturally enriching.\nThe third Vietnam-Japan International Conference focused on strengthening bilateral ties through creative tourism, aiming to merge sustainability with cultural preservation. Both nations are committed to fostering community engagement and innovation, ensuring that tourism becomes a force for economic and cultural growth. A Vision for the Future\nAs both nations continue to explore the potential of creative tourism, they envision a future where travel goes beyond the typical sightseeing experience. Creative tourism provides an opportunity for tourists to engage directly with local cultures, enriching their journeys while simultaneously contributing to the growth of the communities they visit. This approach is more than just a trend—it represents a broader vision of tourism as a force for cultural preservation, sustainable economic development, and social empowerment.\nThe conference underscored the importance of continued collaboration between Vietnam and Japan as they strive to be leaders in the global shift toward creative and sustainable tourism. Both nations are committed to promoting a tourism model that values authenticity, creativity, and sustainability, ensuring that future generations of travelers will continue to experience the rich cultural tapestries of both countries.\nBy embracing this philosophy, Vietnam and Japan aim to create tourism destinations that reflect the diversity, beauty, and resilience of their cultures while providing meaningful, immersive experiences for visitors. As the tourism industry evolves, these two nations will continue to be at the forefront of integrating sustainability with creativity, ensuring that their cultural heritage thrives for years to come.
