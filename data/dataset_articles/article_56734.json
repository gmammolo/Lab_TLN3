  "text": "The South African National Parks (SANParks) boardwalk pertaining to the Garden Route National Park’s Wilderness section is receiving eco-friendly restorative work to enhance safety and access, and improve the boardwalk’s sustainability for the public. This improvement in the boardwalk’s safety and access will make it ecological and provide value to people. This is an ongoing restoration project which aims to fix the boardwalk so it can be appreciated in its natural state. SANParks is carrying out the work with the boardwalk in mind to be completed by March 31 2026. This is to ensure the boardwalk’s views remain pristine and the ecological value of South Africa’s wilderness is accessible to all.\nRegarded as one of the icons of the Garden Route, the Waterside Boardwalk is the gateway for guests wanting to explore the Wilderness Section with its mesmerising forests, calm rivers, and rich bird diversity. Nonetheless, the past year has shown the impact of relentless floods and significantly deteriorated weathering, making such restoration efforts imperative. In every aspect of the project, SANParks has given primacy to the idea of sustainability, hence, the adoption of low-impact construction and other durable, restorative materials to limit the impact of the project on ancillary fauna or flora. This adds to the growing case of protecting the country’s reputation as a choice tourism destination while trying to meet the global expectation of responsible tourism. Advertisement Priorities in restoration balance both safety and sustainability\nReplacing damaged deck timber, reinforcing support members of the deck, and increasing the overall strength of the boardwalk are the main tasks of this restoration. Such enhancements will make certain the longevity of the boardwalk, thus securing the safety of the nature beneath as well as the guests walking on its surface. For the enhancement, materials were chosen with consideration to minimizing the impact to the environment and resisting the varying climate of the region. Advertisement While construction is ongoing, visitors to the Garden Route National Park will still have the ability to visit other parts of the Wilderness Section. The Waterside Boardwalk, however, will be closed for construction and is still to be determined for the safety of the visitors. For these visitors, other options will be provided. The park, however, will still be open for the public, and guests will still be able to visit the park’s walking trails, recreational areas, and numerous birdwatching sites.\nThe sustainable materials and techniques used ensures the boardwalk is within eco-friendly standards, and thus, will make the boardwalk a sustainable attraction. It will also make others friendly structures as a blueprint to model the eco-friendly boardwalk’s construction. The eco-restoration will be a model for sustainable construction so the growth of SANParks will not hinder the preservation of diverse natural heritage of South Africa. Advertisement The standout features of the Garden Route National Park, the Waterside Boardwalk, will be one of the features that allows the visitors to access the boardwalk for a close view of the rich biodiversity and the natural beauty of the Garden Route. With the reopening of the boardwalk in 2026, the visitors will be able to admire the view of the Touw River and the surrounding forest.\n‘The upgrade will additionally improve the overall visitor experience by making sure the boardwalk is sturdy, enjoyable, and easily accessible by all, including individuals who are physically challenged. This helps more people appreciate and enjoy the most responsible nature immersion available.’\n‘In addition, the project enhances South Africa’s overarching tourism development strategy which encourages nature based travel for conservation awareness and responsible tourism. The rehabilitated Waterside Boardwalk, as developed, will strengthen the Garden Route’s attraction as an eco-tourism destination and serve as an example for other global travel regions.’\nThe Restored Waterside Boardwalk is a Model for Sustainable Tourism Infrastructure\nThe repair of the Waterside Boardwalk helps set the pace for other competitors on the African continent trying to modernise their tourism infrastructure while retaining the core tenets of eco-sustainability. The South African national parks model and approach to planning and development, which centres on the protection of natural resources, is outstanding for other regions as well. Visitors are assured of an unparalleled experience and the integrity of the natural resources is uncompromised. This is an extremely pressing and necessary situation. The impact of extreme weather and climate change, are more necessary outcome for all across the world.’\nWith the restoration of the Waterside Boardwalk, South Africa continues to invest in responsible tourism by implementing long-term strategies. This project exemplifies how strategic maintenance and environmental conservation can improve the experience of users while protecting priceless nature.\nFor tourism professionals throughout the continent, this serves as a reminder of the need to invest in tourism infrastructure and integrate sustainability as a core principle of tourism development. As more travellers seek out green destinations, the importance of this project and others like it becomes more apparent.\nImpact of Tourism and Growth Opportunities\nThe completion of the boardwalk restoration by 2026 is planned so it coincides with the busy travel season, which would provide a new reason for visitors to discover the Garden Route. This is particularly important because the Garden Route is one of the most busy tourism areas in South Africa, which provides ample opportunity to improve the infrastructure and enhance the conservation of the region. As a result, South Africa will benefit economically and tourists will have even more reason to visit due to the international concern regarding travel congestion.\nThe enhanced boardwalk will enable visitors to the park to enjoy its beauty while increasing the park’s appeal to nature enthusiasts, bird watchers, and outdoors people. The restoration will help achieve the strategic objective of the Garden Route National Park to diversify the tourist seasons and attract visitors all year long. The people and the boardwalk will be in harmony and people will be able to appreciate the beauty of the park without trespassing on nature’s domain to achieve nature’s purpose unobstructed.
