  "text": "The dust had barely settled on Ellie Watson’s newly built home, Valle Casa, before she surprised her followers by putting the sprawling estate – whose creation they’d watched unfold in real time – on the market. Located in the Gold Coast hinterland suburb of Currumbin Valley, the influencer and author’s meticulously well-documented build captivated over 30,000 people as she and her husband built their Mediterranean-meets-contemporary Australian dream home from the ground up.\nNow, after just one year of living in it, Ellie Watson listed Valle Casa for sale, and this week it became the most popular property listing going under the hammer in the country, according to realestate.com.au.\nEllie Watson is a Gold Coast based influencer with over 650K followers on her health and lifestyle Instagram channel. She is also the founder of fashion brand Juni, sustainable homewares brand The Wholesome Store, and a best-selling author.\nShe lives in the secluded Currumbin oasis with her husband Alex, their two children, Bowie, 5, and Zimi, 3, and their dog, Oatly. Prior to building the Currumbin Valley home, they lived around the corner in a light-filled, modern home in Palm Beach on the Gold Coast.\nThe modern contemporary interiors, with limewashed ceilings, Taj Mahal quartzite and plenty of micro-cement, make for a light-filled home with definite market appeal. The five-bedroom, three-bathroom, Mediterranean-inspired home sits on 5,404 square-metres and boasts a resort-like feel. Located just minutes from the Gold Coast’s popular Currumbin Beach, it still feels secluded thanks to its tree-lined locale offering both privacy and connection.\nFeaturing multiple large living spaces, an enviable indoor-outdoor connection, and a vast entertaining deck that overlooks an oversized swimming pool, the picturesque home has attracted plenty of attention during its short sales campaign.\nEllie and Alex began construction on Valle Casa in March 2023 and finally completed it in February 2024. But in a surprising turn of events, it was listed for sale the very next year, in October 2025. “People are a bit shocked we’re selling,” Ellie admitted to realestate.com.au.\n“We built it with the intention of it being our dream home, but I loved the creative process, so we’re keen to do it again.”\nAs for their next steps, Ellie and Alex haven’t spoken publicly about what their next step in the housing journey will be, but one thing’s for certain: they’ve got the reno bug.\n498 Currumbin Creek Road, Currumbin Valley is set to go to auction on Saturday 15th November at 10AM with listing agents Christina James and Amir Mian of Amir Prestige Group.\nPrice hopes for the Currumbin Valley property start from $6.5 million, but if the popularity of the listing is anything to go by, the actual sales price could skyrocket on auction day.",
