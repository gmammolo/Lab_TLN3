  "text": "The festive season is synonymous with joy, connection – and let’s be honest – more than its fair share of chaos.\nBetween overstuffed fridges, last-minute guests, and ambitious social calendars, our homes can turn from calm to catastrophe faster than you can say “the turkey’s dry.” But, before you consider skipping your Christmas commitments for good (or a stay in ‘The Holiday‘ cottage, perhaps?), there are plenty of ways to avoid pre-party overwhelm – and it might be easier than you think. According to H&G’s food editor, Amanda Cordony, the key to securing a stress-free Christmas for you and your guests is all about working smarter – never harder.\nThis summer, Amanda has teamed up with Hisense to share her golden rules for effortless entertaining. The result? A blueprint for holiday hosting minus the mayhem.\nHow to keep calm and cool this Christmas\n1. Let the fridge do the prep work\nA calm host is a prepared one – and planning starts with what’s behind the fridge door. “The best celebrations are relaxed, generous and intuitive,” Amanda says. “Hisense’s new PureView Fridge takes that same approach – it works intelligently behind the scenes so you can be present with your guests and live in the moment. It’s like having a sous-chef who anticipates your every move.”\nSmart fridges like Hisense’s PureView model make it easy to plan ahead, thanks to features like adjustable shelving and a touchscreen hub that manages your food inventory and even suggests recipes to suit. That sad bag of spinach that always succumbs to back-of-shelf neglect? Consider it a thing of the past with the PureView’s clever alert system for expiring ingredients. Plus, with its antibacterial interior and UV water treatment, you can marinate, chop and slice days in advance, knowing your produce will stay crisp until Christmas lunch.\nTo lighten the mental load, Amanda recommends allocating dedicated zones in the fridge to keep things under control. “Utilising zones will help you not only create more storage but also find things faster and know what you have and don’t,” she says. Likewise, using good quality, airtight containers to store fresh produce in the fridge and freezer will extend the life of your groceries until the next shopping haul.\nH&G Tip\nTake inventory a week before guests arrive. Clear out condiments and freezer clutter to make space for entertaining essentials – think platters, drinks and make-ahead desserts.\n2. Turn your table into a talking point\nThere’s something magical about a shared Christmas table – especially if it’s buffet-style. “A generously sized table invites guests to serve themselves and linger longer,” says Amanda. “This turns dining into an experience of shared connection.”\nWhether you’re hosting a large group or a party of two, setting the table should involve more than putting down plates and cutlery. It’s about creating an atmosphere, so set the mood with soft ambient lighting, curate your music, and use textiles to create an inviting tablescape that keeps the conversation going.\nH&G Tip\nCreate a flexible centrepiece – like a trough of herbs, a row of pillar candles, or even a bowl of citrus – that can be easily shifted around when dishes are added.\n3. Set and don’t forget\nWith so much to juggle, even seasoned hosts can forget the canapés under the grill or the Champagne in the freezer. Thankfully, the heart of the home is fast becoming the hub of the home, with a range of high-tech devices available to keep you connected and in control.\nThe PureView’s intuitive display and ConnectLife compatibility lets you manage recipes, set timers, and add to your shopping list – and not a single flour-covered fingerprint in sight.\nH&G Tip\nDigitise your holiday recipes in advance and share them with family members who want to lend a hand.\n4. Simple servings\nIt should go without saying, but for those of us who could use a gentle reminder: you don’t need an elaborate menu to impress your guests. In fact, Cordony swears by simplicity. “Seasonal ingredients need little more than olive oil or citrus to shine,” she notes.\nWhen it comes to planning a menu think about how much time you will have to prepare and choose dishes that you’re comfortable cooking. By focusing on fresh, in-season produce – and storing it properly – you can spend less time cooking and more time connecting with your guests. After all, if there’s too much to do, you risk passing that frantic energy onto your guests and that’s exactly what you’re trying to avoid.\nH&G Tip\nKeep a few hero ingredients on hand that elevate any dish – think fresh herbs, flaky sea salt, lemon and good quality condiments.\nKeep it cool: smart holiday menus with fridge space in mind\nFrom make-ahead desserts to summer-leaning salads, these effortless recipes from The Cordony Kitchen are made for easy entertaining.\nThe final checklist\nA week before Christmas\n- Deep clean the fridge and pantry\n- Stock up on long-life entertaining staples like crackers and condiments\n- Plan tableware and serving pieces: polish cutlery and check glassware\nThe day before\n- Prepare grazing boards and store covered in the fridge\n- Chill wine and water overnight\n- Style the table so you’re not scrambling the next day\nThe day of\n- Prep a hosting zone near the kitchen – think extra napkins, trays, cutlery and glassware\n- Delegate, delegate, delegate! Assign one person to drinks and another to the canapes\n- Light candles, queue the playlist and enjoy the day",
