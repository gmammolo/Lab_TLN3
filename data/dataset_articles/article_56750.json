  "text": "In the heart of Mumbai, where dreams often collide with harsh reality, a young girl's life was set on a path she never chose. At the age of 12, Kalpana Saroj, born into a Dalit family, was married and taken away from her schoolbooks. Her new home was a slum, and her new life was a nightmare of domestic abuse and crushing poverty. The suffering was so profound that it pushed her to the brink. Kalpana attempted suicide, feeling she had no way out. It was her darkest hour. Thankfully, her father rescued her, bringing her back to her parental home. But the scars remained. At 16, the fight for survival began in earnest. She took a job at a government cloth mill in Mumbai. Her salary was a meager Rs. 2 per month. For many, this would be the definition of a dead-end. But for Kalpana, it was the first, hard-earned brick on which she would build her future. With fierce determination, she learned sewing. She started by stitching clothes, slowly increasing her income to Rs. 50 a month. This was not just money; it was evidence of her own capability. It was the seed of self-reliance. After gaining experience, she took a big risk. She secured a loan of Rs. 50,000 and started her own small business. She ventured into furniture and with her sharp mind and strong network, expanded into real estate. She then founded her own firm, KS Film Production. Her reputation as a tenacious and savvy businesswoman grew. This reputation led to the most significant challenge of her career. Kamani Tubes, a respected company, was on the verge of collapse, drowning in debt and unable to pay its 3,500 employees for nearly three years. In 2001, Kalpana was approached for help. She didn't just advise; she took charge. She purchased the company and began a grueling process of restructuring. She reorganized the business, streamlined operations, and infused it with her unwavering resolve. Under her leadership, the dying company was revived. She cleared its debts, ensured the workers were paid, and transformed it into a profitable enterprise. Today, Kamani Tubes is a success story, generating revenues of over Rs. 100 crore. Kalpana Saroj, the child bride who once earned Rs. 2, now has a net worth estimated at Rs. 1000 crore. She is the Chairperson of Kamani Tubes, a Padma Shri awardee, and a member of the Board of Governors at IIM Bangalore. Kalpana Saroj’s life is not a fairy tale. It is a blueprint. It is a powerful reminder that our beginnings do not have to dictate our endings. That the most beautiful metals are forged in the hottest fires.\",",
