  "text": "Thank you for featuring our community in your article, \"Young adults turn to Quakers' silent worship,\" in the Nov. 8-9 edition.\nThe Wilderness Friends Quaker Meeting gathers locally at 10 a.m. every Sunday in the Shrewsbury Library. We are a small, friendly, welcoming group that meets in silent worship, guided by Quaker principles of peace, equality, simplicity, integrity, community and stewardship. We believe everyone carries an inner light — a connection to God or Spirit — which can be felt through silent reflection.",
