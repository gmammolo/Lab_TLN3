  "text": "By Paolo Mariano ,\n1 hours ago\nDaniel Dunn-Imagn Images The post Warriors’ Stephen Curry laughs at his ‘6-7’ dad joke after win over Spurs appeared first on ClutchPoints .\nThe Golden State Warriors trooped to Frost Bank Center on Wednesday and took care of business after beating the San Antonio Spurs, 125-120.\nThe Warriors bounced back from their embarrassing loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder and survived the triple-double of Victor Wembanyama, who had 31 points, 14 rebounds, and 10 assists.\nStephen Curry reminded everyone that he’s still one of the league’s elite, exploding for a season-high 46 points on 13-of-25 shooting from the field, including five three-pointers. He added five rebounds, five assists, and two steals.\nWith the win, the Warriors improved to 7-6, and Curry couldn’t help but reference the popular “6-7” meme as he made his way back to the locker room.\n“7-6 is better than 6-7,” said the two-time MVP before laughing at his joke.\nIf you’re not aware yet of the “6-7” craze, then you must still be saying “very demure, very mindful.”\nThe 37-year-old Curry, who probably stays abreast of every meme because of his kids, had plenty of help in their victory. Jimmy Butler had 28 points, six rebounds, eight assists, and three steals, while Moses Moody chipped in 19 points built on five three-pointers.\nThey snapped the Spurs’ three-game winning streak.\nThe Warriors are still groping for consistency, but with Curry still doing his thing, they will always have a chance. The sweet-shooting guard has helped build a winning culture in Golden State, with team owner Joe Lacob even expressing his confidence that they can still be successful when Curry retires.\nThe Warriors will aim for back-to-back wins against the Spurs when they meet again on Friday.",
