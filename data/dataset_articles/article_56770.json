  "text": "Two ⁣Zodiac Signs Poised for EuroMillions Luck as⁤ €123 Million Jackpot Looms PARIS – Astrologers are pointing to a rare celestial ⁢alignment occurring on⁢ November 14, 2025, as perhaps boosting the lottery luck of individuals ⁢born under the signs⁣ of Cancer and Scorpio .With a staggering €123 million EuroMillions jackpot up for grabs, the cosmic forecast suggests these two signs may have ‍an increased chance of winning.\nThe favorable conditions stem from the formation of two “cosmic kites”-rare planetary configurations created by beneficial astrological aspects-that promise ⁤a climate ⁢of abundance and fluidity. Crucially, the ⁣EuroMillions draw will ​coincide with a stellar alignment connecting the Sun in Scorpio, Jupiter, and Saturn, generating energy believed to be conducive to prosperity.\nCancer individuals are experiencing a particularly auspicious period,‌ with Jupiter currently in thier sign ‍alongside the‌ influence of Venus and the Sun in scorpio. Astrologers advise those born under Cancer to heed intuitive guidance and participate in the ⁢draw.\nscorpio⁤ natives are also highlighted as frontrunners, benefiting​ from the Sun and Venus shining in their constellation, amplifying their power of attraction. The dominance ​of “water energy” in​ the current astrological landscape is predicted to⁢ support Scorpios in their pursuit of the jackpot.\nEuroMillions tickets cost €2.50. The draw takes place on November 14, 2025.",
