  "text": "The Forest Lake girls swim and dive team left Northdale Middle School in Coon Rapids in high spirits following a whole array of superb performances across the board from the Rangers in the Section 7AA championship meet from Thursday, Nov. 6 to Saturday, Nov. 8.\nThe squad, which is in its first season under the helm of first-year head coach Maddi Johnson, finished third overall as a team (324) this past weekend and also had a wide variety of athletes punch their tickets to the Class AA state meet, which is to be held at the Jean K. Freeman Aquatic Center on the campus of the University of Minnesota later this week.\nJohnson details the excitement surrounding the ability in sending a good amount of Rangers to the state meet in just her first season guiding the maroon and gold.\n“As a first year head coach, it is super exciting to send so many girls to state,” Johnson said.\n“I couldn’t have imagined at the beginning of the season the kind of success we would have this year. Not only for the five that made it [to state], but also for all the other girls. There wasn’t a single meet that we had this season where someone didn’t swim or dive a personal or season best.\n“The girls all worked really hard all season long, and it certainly paid off in the end,” she stated.\nSenior diver Lacey Gray was the first of many Rangers to crack a state nod, where she posted a second-place finish overall with a final score of 331.75, just .10 points away from the first place diver from Andover. The 200 medley relay unit, which has been strong all year long, also took second overall. Seniors Megan Reid and Hailey Johnson, along with junior Delaney Nilius and sophomore Sylvie Fallon, helped lead a 1:53.56 final time for the relay team’s second consecutive state appearance.\nJohnson claimed second as well in the 500 free, earning a 5:28.66 time, while Nilius rounded out the final state contestants for Forest Lake this fall by grabbing a strong first-place finish in the 100 breast with a winning 1:05.51 time. The girls’ overall team finish was only 7.5 points away from second place Duluth East, while finishing a comfortable 28.5 points ahead of Andover in fourth.\nPrior to the meet, Johnson and the teams’ expectations consisted of giving it everything they had, while also applying what they’ve learned over the course of the fall campaign and putting it to the test.\n“My hope was to see the girls do their best,” she said.\n“We just wanted to give this meet our all, and they one-hundred-percent did that. With our section having teams that we don’t regularly compete with during the season, it can be tricky at times to have any sort of idea of where we might end up.\n“But overall, I was pleasantly surprised with how we finished as a team and how every individual did.”\nFrom the preliminary competition to the final round, all of the Rangers who will compete at state this week starting on Thursday, Nov. 13, made substantial improvements upon their initial times throughout the meet. That progress turned out to be crucial down the stretch for those Rangers as the jumps were enough to finish within the top-two places in their respective events — which is the state qualifying threshold.\nGray wound up fourth overall in the prelims, before moving up to third in the semifinals and ultimately cracking the top-two places after the finals to finish as the 7AA runner-up. The 200 medley team shaved off nearly two seconds of valuable time from the prelims to the finals, helping solidify a top-two finish. Nilius also shed nearly a full second and a half off from her preliminary time (1:06.95) to the finals (1:05.51), locking in a third state berth for the talented breast stroker.\nJohnson also did enough to claim her first state appearance (5:28.66), taking off roughly two seconds from her prelim time (5:30.61).\nHeading into the state meet, Johnson’s message to the girls is the same as it’s been all season long.\n“Although it may be a bigger stage, it’s still just a meet and they have all of what it takes to do well,” she said.\nBut the main component that the first year head coach aims to see following the end of the state competition is full effort and satisfaction from the effort that’s been put in by her Rangers all year long.\n“The biggest thing I’d like to see from [the girls] is that they really gave it all they had, and that they are happy with their seasons. Coaching isn’t about how I do, it’s about how well I can set the girls up for success and hopefully they will see how incredibly successful this season has been,” she said.\nGray will compete first at the Jean K. Freeman Aquatic Center in Minneapolis, where she will hit the water on Nov. 13 at 6 p.m. for preliminary action, before the Class AA diving finals will take place on Saturday, Nov. 15 at 6 p.m.\nFriday, Nov. 14 is when the girls’ 200 medley unit, along with Nilius and Johnson in the 100 breast and 500 free, respectively, will compete starting at 6 p.m. Should any of those Rangers make the finals, the competition will be held the following day at 6 p.m.",
