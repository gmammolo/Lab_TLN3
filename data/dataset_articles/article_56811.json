  "text": "Park Avenue review: Fiona Shaw is a treat in this fine New York family drama\nIn cinemas; Cert 12A\n“Mothers and their daughters” is a sharp aphorism for the warfare that can ensue between adolescent girls and their mammies. It’s the foundation for this upmarket family drama from director Gaby Dellal that finds two women sorting their dirty laundry during a crossroads in their relationship.\nFiona Shaw is typically resplendent as Kit, a glamorous Manhattan retiree whose motto is “not past it yet, darling”. Katherine Waterston plays daughter Charlotte, rocking up from her failing marriage out in the sticks.\nThere is love between the women but clearly a lot of baggage that is now coming to a head thanks to their sudden proximity and Kit’s shaky health.\nThey’re orbited by an assortment of Manhattanites who hold some kind of sway, particularly Charlotte’s childhood friend-turned-doorman Anders (Chaske Spencer), who has both of the ladies’ affections.\nShaw is a treat as the elegant, bohemian matriarch smuggling vulnerability beneath the devil-may-care flourishes. Kudos also to Waterston, whose frowns and folded arms perfectly essay that unique brand of conflicted-offspring disgruntlement.\nThree stars",
