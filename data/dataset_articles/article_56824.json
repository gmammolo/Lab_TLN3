  "text": "My Chicest Friend Always Changes Her Bedding for the Holidays – I've Sent Her This Ultra Sweet Martha Stewart-Designed Set for Christmas 2025\nWhen holiday spirit meets impeccable taste, you get a Martha Stewart Christmas quilt set that’s as stylish as it is festive (and under $170)\nMegan Slack\nNews\nEvery acquaintance of mine has their own unique quirk when it comes to Christmas traditions, but perhaps the sweetest of them all is my chicest friend's love for holiday bedding.\nEvery year, around mid-November, she switches out her white comforter for a more festive – but still stylish – alternative, and this year, I've got her covered. Courtesy of Martha Stewart, no less.\nThe original influencer, through her Amazon storefront, is no stranger to shaping our decorating habits around the calendar, but her Christmas-themed pieces are among my all-time favorites.\nThe Dancing Deer Red Quilt Set (available at Amazon) combines everything I love about Martha-designed bedding (it's well-made and easy to care for) with a festive twist that isn't gimmicky. I believe it's one of the best bedding buys you can make for the holidays, which is why I sent it to my friend immediately.\nThe quilt set, crafted from soft brushed polyester, offer a cozy, inviting feel perfect for holiday gatherings and festive nights, and my friend agrees. Classic quilting and tailored finishes create a polished, versatile look, ideal for layering or seasonal decor. It brings enduring warmth and style to any holiday setting (and will look just as good next Christmas).\nThis quilt's aesthetic first stopped me in my tracks, but after a little more research, I discovered that its darker colorway is one of the best tones you can introduce when decorating with red in a bedroom.\nThis color is notoriously tricky to introduce into your space without it negatively impacting your sleep, which is why opting for a darker hue is vital.\n'Red has long held stimulating connotations, which can cause our bodies to react accordingly without us realising. In a bedroom setting, this leads to us being more alert when we should be winding down to rest, disrupting both the quantity and quality of our sleep. This is why, when looking to work reds into your space, making mindful colour choices is essential. Darker and more muted tones are best suited for a bedroom, adding a layer of sophistication and elegance alongside the warmth that you’re building towards,' comments Magdalena Gierasinska, the Head of Product and Displays at Barker and Stonehouse.\nDesign expertise in your inbox – from inspiring decorating ideas and beautiful celebrity homes to practical gardening advice and shopping round-ups.\nAs Magdalena explains, darker red shades work best when incorporated through the use of throws, blankets, headboards, and rugs that 'drape your space in decadence.'\n'Alternatively, darker, more muted reds could be used when colour-capping for a bolder statement,' she says.\nI've found the perfect accessories to make this injection of red even simpler, whether you invest in Martha's bedding or not. With these pieces, you can be discreetly festive but still sleep well – all December long.\nMegan is the Head of Celebrity Style News at Homes & Gardens, where she leads the celebrity/ news team. She has a history in interior design, travel, and news journalism, having lived and worked in New York, Paris, and, currently, London.
