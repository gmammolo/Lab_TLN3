  "text": "ABUJA – The Federal Government has announced plans to attempt a Guinness World Record for the longest dining table in the world — a 3.6-kilometre stretch designed to host between 2,000 and 3,000 guests in Abuja this December.\nThe record bid will headline the Mega Renewed Hope NIHOTOUR Gastronomy Festival, an initiative of the National Institute for Hospitality and Tourism (NIHOTOUR) in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Art, Culture, Tourism and the Creative Economy.\nSpeaking at a joint world press conference in Abuja, the Director-General of NIHOTOUR, Aare Abisoye Fagade, said the record attempt would hold on December 6, with the table later converted into a communal dining space for a grand celebration of food, culture, and entertainment.\n“We plan to break the record in the morning of December 6 and use the same table for a dining event later. There will be food, culture, music, and comedy in the evening. It will show that Abuja can also host major cultural events in December,” Fagade stated.\nHe explained that the initiative aligns with President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda, using gastronomy to promote Nigeria’s culinary diversity and boost opportunities in hospitality and the creative economy.\nFagade further revealed that the festival is part of NIHOTOUR’s strategy to strengthen the tourism value chain through skills development, entrepreneurship, and youth empowerment. He also highlighted NIHOTOUR’s partnership with Novarosta, which he said would enhance technical capacity, expand training opportunities, and boost international exposure for Nigerian culinary professionals.\n“Through our partnership with Novarosta, we are expanding the frontiers of hospitality training and positioning Nigeria as a global player in gastronomy,” he added.\nOn her part, the Minister of Art, Culture, Tourism and the Creative Economy, Hannatu Musa Musawa, described the initiative as a bold statement of Nigeria’s creative potential and a strategic platform for economic inclusion.\n“When we talk about economic growth and youth development, gastronomy plays a role just like film, music, and fashion. People eat every day, and Nigeria has made significant progress in showcasing its food globally,” Musawa said.\nShe commended the creativity of Nigerian chefs and food entrepreneurs for advancing cultural diplomacy and expanding the country’s global cultural influence.\nThe week-long festival, themed “Oriki: Taste of Culture,” will feature exhibitions, culinary masterclasses, cultural showcases, food tastings, and investment forums.\nPresident Tinubu is expected to formally unveil the festival and the Guinness World Record attempt in Abuja.",
