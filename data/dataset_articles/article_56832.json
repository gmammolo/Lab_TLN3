  "text": "1 days ago This article contains content summarized with AI. Learn more.\nLate‑night tacos have finally clocked in for Sugar Land . Dallas‑born Velvet Taco is now serving on Hwy 6 near Town Square, confirmed “now open” after its Sept. 15 debut. Beyond the hype, what does this addition actually bring? A globe‑trotting taco board, boozy frozen drinks and cocktails, and a weekly surprise that keeps regulars coming back — with hours stretching to midnight on Fridays and Saturdays.\nImage by T.Tseng On the menu, Velvet Taco leans chef‑driven and from‑scratch: Spicy Tikka Chicken, Bacon Smash Burger, and Mexi‑Cali Shrimp tacos; sides like elote, guacamole, and queso; and the cult‑favorite Red Velvet Cake . Cocktails include margaritas and sangrita. The hallmark WTF (Weekly Taco Feature) drops a new limited‑run taco each week — underscored by a Halloween “Wicked Al Pastor” teaser featuring crickets rolled out across the chain.\nFind counter‑service at 2330 Hwy 6 with daily hours 11 a.m.–10 p.m. (Sun–Thu) and late‑night to midnight (Fri–Sat). The phone is (281) 299‑3301. The 3,110‑square‑foot space seats 89 inside and 34 on the patio, aiming for an all‑day hangout. The address previously housed a Chick‑fil‑A before it relocated across Hwy 6 in December 2022 — a small marker of turnover and reinvestment around Town Square .\nOrdering spans dine‑in, online, and third‑party delivery; early Uber Eats ratings sit at 4.6/5. Catering covers Taco Boxes and Party Packs to individual lunchboxes and boozy libations. Early Yelp comments cite a drive‑thru lane from the former footprint, though the company hasn’t published drive‑thru details. Join The Velvet Room for sign‑up chips & queso, a birthday cake slice, ongoing point rewards, “Wreck the Weekend” perks through Dec. 28, and a gift‑card deal with free‑taco cards redeemable Jan. 1–Feb. 28, 2026.\nWhy it matters: another nationally known fast‑casual player adds momentum to Town Square ’s refresh — and gives locals longer weekend hours, cocktails, and a constantly changing weekly taco to try. Early reaction trends positive on service and variety, with some price‑and‑portion comparisons typical of a new opening. Will you check out Velvet Taco , catch a WTF drop, or stick with your standby?
