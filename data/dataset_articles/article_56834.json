Made from 5 simple ingredients, and ready to enjoy in under 30 minutes. Brunch is served!\nBrunch is Served!\nIs there anything better than French toast in the morning? We love a good sweet breakfast recipe like our French toast bake or our French toast sticks. And today, we’re comin’ in hot with an oh so classic French toast recipe.\nWhy make french toast?\n- Ready in under 30: whether you’re making this French toast recipe for Sunday brunch, or in the morning before school, they are ready in less than 30 minutes.\n- Simple ingredients: you only need 5 easy to find ingredients for French toast.\n- Kid-friendly: you’re kids are going to go crazy for this delicious breakfast!\n- Easy to freeze: bonus!

You’ll need:\n- Eggs: this recipe calls for 6 large eggs. We recommend farm fresh and/or organic.\n- Milk: any kind of milk works for French toast. Feel free to use a dairy-free milk such as almond milk or cow’s milk, too.\n- Maple syrup: you can’t go wrong with a hint of maple when it comes to French toast!\n- Thick-cut bread: we love a good thick-cut bread for French toast. You can use any artisan bread or brioche. White bread will soak up the egg mixture a lot easier than whole grain, but if you prefer whole grain or GF bread, that will absolutely work, too.\n- Butter: when in doubt, fry in butter!\nDon’t Forget the Cinnamon Sugar Sprinkle!\nThe cinnamon sugar topping really is the chef’s kiss for this French toast recipe. It’s so simple and you only need two ingredients:\n- light brown sugar\n- ground cinnamon\nTip! Jazz up your cinnamon sugar topping and use a fun spice mix such as chai spice or pumpkin pie spice.\nhow to make\nFrench Toast in the Oven\nThis Sheet Pan French Toast is the answer to your brunch dreams! It’s ready to serve in under 30 minutes, and can easily be doubled to serve a crowd.\nHow to Make French Toast – Step by Step\nFor the full recipe, scroll down to the recipe card for a list of ingredients and instructions.\nMake Cinnamon Sugar Topping\nFirst, make the cinnamon sugar topping by combining brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. This will be sprinkled on each slice of French toast 😀\nWhisk Wet Ingredients\nNow it’s time to whisk together the eggs, milk, and maple syrup in a bowl.\nDip Bread in Egg Mixture\nSubmerge each slice of bread in the egg mixture and let it sit for around 1 minute to really soak up all the goodness.\nThen, lift the bread out of the mixture and let excess egg drip off each piece of bread. You’ll repeat this step for every slice of bread.\nFry & Flip\nHeat 1 tablespoon of butter over medium/low heat in a large non-stick skillet. Add around 1/3 of the French toast slices to the pan, making sure they are spaced out and not touching.\nLet the French toast cook for around 3 minutes, or until one side turns golden brown.\nFlip French toast slices and turn the heat up to medium. Cook the other side for 2-3 more minutes, or until golden brown.\nBefore removing the slices from the pan, sprinkle on a generous amount of cinnamon sugar on each slice of French toast and flip. Let cook for 20 seconds and do the same thing on the other side. This will caramelize the cinnamon sprinkle — DELISH.\nRepeat\nUse a piece of paper towel to wipe your pan to remove the brown bits. Turn the heat back down to low/medium and repeat this process 2 more times or until all French toast slices are cooked.\nServe & Enjoy!\nServe with any of the following breakfast recipes to round out the perfect brunch. ENJOY!\nwhat to serve with French toast\nMake this a complete meal by pairing with any of the following perfectly brunch-worthy recipes we have on Fit Foodie Finds:\nHealthy Swaps for French Toast\nUse whole grain bread: instead of using a white bread such as brioche, feel free to use any kind of whole grain bread. We prefer a thicker bread for French toast, but thin slices will work, too.\nSkip the cinnamon sugar topping: instead of using cinnamon sugar, use just ground cinnamon. This will help reduce the amount of sugar in this recipe.\nUse less butter: instead of butter, you can use cooking spray. This will help reduce both fat and calories.\nHow to Make\nCold Brew Coffee\nCheck out this super simple tutorial on how to make your own cold brew coffee at home with just 2 ingredients!\nToppings for French Toast\nNow that you’ve whipped up a perfect batch of French toast, it’s time to top these delicious slices with even more deliciousness. We recommend:\n- fresh berries\n- whipped cream\n- peanut butter\n- walnuts or pecans\n- powdered sugar\nStoring French Toast\nLet your French toast slices cool completely. Then, transfer them into an air-tight container and seal. Store in the fridge for up to 3-5 days.\nTo reheat: we love reheating our French toast in the toaster! Simply toast on medium or until nice and crispy on the outside.\nFreezing French Toast\nFrench toast is a great breakfast to freeze for later. Follow these simple instructions:\n- First, let the French toast slices cool completely.\n- Then, wrap 2 slices of French toast (1 serving) with tin foil or place in a freezer-safe bag. Remove as much air as possible and seal.\n- Store in the freezer for up to 3 months.\nFrench Toast Recipe\nIngredients\n- 6 large eggs\n- 3/4 cups milk, any kind\n- 1 tablespoon\nmaple syrup - 8 slices thick-cut bread, artisan, brioche, etc.\n- 3 tablespoons butter\nCinnamon Sugar\n- 1 tablespoon\nlight brown sugar - 2 teaspoons\nground cinnamon\nInstructions\n- First, make cinnamon sugar topping by combining brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.

Whole wheat bread works too, but we love a thick-cut piece of bread for French toast!\n- All stovetops vary, so make sure you start off cooking these on medium/low. The goal is to cook the egg and not burn them!\nNutrition\nNutrition information is automatically calculated, so should only be used as an approximation.\nlove this? leave a comment below!\nDon’t forget to tag your posts on social media with the hashtag #fitfoodiefinds, we’d love to see what you’re up to!",
