  "text": "By Uncle Dave ,\n4 hours ago\nWelcome to November, Seasons are changing, it’s getting colder, and the prime tourist season for the Seattle area has pretty much gone by the wayside. As we are all scrambling to figure out how to use up the rest of our personal time off before it all goes away at the end of the year, here’s something to think about.\nWhy not have a vacation in Seattle? Getty Images The nonprofit travel organization called visitseattle.org is putting forth the idea that now would be a perfect time for you to spend time in Seattle and see the sights.\nAccording to seattletimes.com,\n‘ The nonprofit travel marketing organization is launching the Perks Pass , a free “passport” that gives locals access to a curated collection of more than 40 discounts and savings on a number of hotels, attractions, wineries and a few restaurants. The passport is a part of the organization’s “There’s Never Been More to SEA” campaign.’\nGetty Images There truly is a lot to see and do in Seattle, and those of us who live on the east side of the mountains don’t necessarily get to spend the time required to see all that there is to see.\nI’ve been telling anyone who would listen to me that I would love to tour the new re-vamped Seattle waterfront, including the expanded Seattle Aquarium. I would also like to hit MoPop, and the Seattle Science Center, And it’s been decades since I’ve been to the Museum of History and Industry. Ohh, how about the Seattle Museum of Flight, that would be cool.\nGetty Images Then you add to that the opportunity for shows in the evening and some really interesting dining experiences (Especially at Pike Place Market.) and you have an opportunity for maybe more than just a weekend to get away.\nYou can sign up for the “perks pass” using your phone, and then you just display it at different businesses that are participating to save some bucks.\nGetty Images I’m going to have to look into this.\nHow about you?\nPerks Pass encourages Seattle locals to revisit downtown with discount | The Seattle Times\nFind More to SEA with Perks Pass – Visit Seattle\n12 Popular Iconic Places to Visit in Seattle Gallery Credit: Reesha Cosby Photo Credit: Gary on Unsplash 1. Visit Pike Place Market in the heart of downtown Seattle. Watch the workers throw the fish in spectacular fashion, and get some pepper jelly, odd knick-knacks, and fresh flowers. Or, dine in one of the Pike Place Market restaurants, visit the original Starbucks location, and take a stroll down Post Alley. 85 Pike St. Photo Credit: Wyand Van Poortvliet on Unsplash 2. Buy a pass to see the arial view of Seattle from the Space Needle. Ride up the elevator to the top floor of the Space Needle, then check out the aerial view of Seattle. The Space Needle was created for the World's Fair in 1962. 400 Broad St. Vincent Camacho on Unsplash 3. Ride the Seattle Great Wheel. This huge Ferris wheel is now a piece of the iconic Seattle skyline. Located at Pier 57 on Alaskan Way. Photo Credit: Edoardo Busti on Unsplash 4. Grab some garlic fries and a pint of brewski at a Seattle Mariners game! The last time I was at a Mariners game, you could text your order from your seat. That was over a decade ago, so I hope they still do that! The games are played at T-Mobile Park stadium at 1250 1st Ave S. Photo Credit Abner Campos on Unsplash 5. Hitch a scenic ride over the water on one of the Washington State Ferries. Our ferry system is the largest ferry fleet in the USA! See where the adventure will take you! Photo Credit: Taylor Rooney on Unsplash 6. Put some gum on the Seattle Gum Wall (but please don't touch the other pieces of gum, EW)! It rarely gets scraped, so feel free to stick your gum on the wall and leave a piece of yourself in Seattle forevermore (at least until they decide to scrape it clean again). It's found in the alley behind Pike Place Market. It was started decades ago by the Unexpected Productions Comedy Improv, 1428 Post Alley. 7. Embrace your inner steampunk at Gas Works Park . Gas Works City Park is located in Seattle at 2101 N Northlake Way. Popular movies and TV shows have been filmed here, including Six Feet Under, 10 Things I Hate About You, and The Amazing Race. Photo Credit: Jason Dent on Unsplash 8. Get a French fry stolen from you by real sea hawk birds on the patio at Pier 54! The scene of the crime(s) happens right next to the patio by Ivar's Fish Bar on the pier. 1001 Alaskan Way. Photo Credit Sylvia Yang on Unsplash 9. Step inside and ooh and ahh over the architecture of the Seattle Center Library Downtown I dare say this is one of the coolest architectural libraries in America. See what's happening during your visit by checking out the events calendar. 1000 4th Ave. Anthony Fomin on Unsplash 10. Tour the Seattle MoPop Museum. Plan your visit to the Seattle Museum of Pop Culture . They have over 85,000 pieces in the collection, including some that you can view online! 325 5th Ave N. 12 Popular Things to Do in Seattle Photo Credit: Jimmy Woo on Unsplash 11. Get tickets to a Seattle Seahawks game at Lumen Field. Thousands of people flock to Lumen Field to cheer on the Seahawks . We have one of the loudest stadium crowds in the nation! Photo Credit: Felipe Galvan on Unsplash 12. Find a place to take amazing views of the Seattle skyline! Welcome to Seattle, the Emerald City! Seattle is home to over 800,000 people. You'll only see a handful of them because tourists pretty much take over the town's biggest tourist spots during the day while everyone else is at work, imho. Ha!\nTRAVEL: How To Enjoy Beautiful Seattle On A Budget Gallery Credit: mwolfe photo by Michelle Wolfe Seattle Is Such A Great City To Visit - Have It To Yourself Seattle is a city of over 730,000 people and one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country. That being said, summer can get VERY busy with visitors - meaning long waits to get into things and reservations needed. Who wants to deal with all that? You can have Seattle to yourself in the winter . Sure it might be cooler and rain more, but you won't have to wait for anything. Hotel rooms are generally cheaper, no lines at major attractions, and get seated right away at restaurants. Photo by Michelle Wolfe Museum of Flight (outside of Seattle) - A Museum Bargain Seattle has tons of museums but BY FAR THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK is the Museum of Flight which is about 15 minutes outside of town but very easy to get to. Admissions is just $26 for adults and discounts might apply to your situation. You can pay way more for way less at other museums. The Museum of Flight is incredibly big, and very well put together. You'll easily spend 3 to 4 hours here - there's just so much to see, even if you're not that into flying. It's super interesting. Japonessa Seattle - Facebook Happy Hour Deals Can Save Tons of Money If you love a good Happy Hour, Seattle has some legit options. It's worthy of your pre-vacation spare time looking up current deals with a simple Google search. (Restaurants and bars come and go, as do Happy Hour deals.) We found several Happy Hours worthy of a visit to the business. Everything from $3 cans of beer at a couple of dive bars, to a fancy Japanese restaurant with an excellent Happy Hour menu that was about 40% off their regular prices for a few hours a day. photo - Michelle Wolfe Seattle's International District You might do some shopping and you should DEFINITELY have lunch, but it doesn't cost a thing to hang out in Seattle's International District. It's one of Seattle's cultural hubs and is worth a visit even though the area isn't nearly as vibrant as it was pre-COVID. photo - Michelle Wolfe Seattle's Chinatown Murals A daytime visit to Chinatown, Japantown, and Koreatown can yield some beautiful street art, and it's free to stroll around. Hing Hay Park is a good place to start. Post-COVID, the International District has been working hard (albeit slowly) to recover with a calendar of fun events and celebrations. Small Business Saturday Food Walks, etc. Google Street View Bargain Food in Seattle's International District The eating is better than the shopping in I.D. in my humble opinion. With that said, the eating is absolutely worth the trip if your a fan of authentic Asian food at bargain prices. Dim sum and noodle houses are staples. It's also nice to order your dim sum by the piece if you just want a quick snack. Obviously, you can place a big order and take it with you for later too. (We did both, but we really love Chinese food. photo - Michelle Wolfe Seattle Kraken Games on Weekdays If your schedule in Seattle is flexible, prices to Kraken games can vary a lot depending on what day of the week it is. Ticket prices can also get cheaper as the day goes on if there's not huge demand. (Kraken games ARE quite popular and the Climate Pledge Arena is very nice.) On our last trip to Seattle, we ended up going to 3 Kraken games and paid vastly different prices for each game. NOTE: Don't forget to factor in the stupidly big Ticketmaster fees. Ugh. photo - Michelle Wolfe Seattle Kraken Hockey Games ARE Fun Professional sports games aren't the best way to save money, but I will say that Seattle gives you a good show for your buck . Climate Pledge Arena is really nice and very state-of-the-art. Games, graphics, special effects - it's quite a production and makes the games some of the most exciting I've ever seen. City Pass - Facebook City Pass Seattle Is a Good Deal In addition to exploring a city on your own to discover hidden gems, it's also fun to see the classic tourist attractions at least once . That stuff can get expensive so get a City Pass. I've bought one for just about every major city I've ever visited, here and abroad, and never regretted it. City Passes are usually customizable - meaning you can buy a small one or a bigger one that included more attractions. The larger ones will probably save you way more money , but you have to make it worth the price by visiting all the attractions.",
