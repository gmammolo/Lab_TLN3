  "text": "Food\nShilpa Shetty’s Bastian Earns Over Rs Crore Every Day ‘...Each Table Was Spending In Lakhs’\nCelebrities often launch their own brands or open their own restaurants to boost their incomes, and Shilpa Shetty is among them. Her restaurant, Bastian, co-owned with Ranjit Bindra, offers some of the most luxurious and exquisite cuisines. Although it had more than two different kinds of outlets in the past, Bastian Bandra recently shut down in September.\nBastian at the Top, however, has been fully functional, and its daily revenue will have you shaking in your boots. Restaurant businesses are always a big risk. They either work or don’t. For Shetty, they offer skyrocketing success.\nShilpa Shetty’s Bastian at the Top earns crores every night\nThe highlight of Bastian at the Top is that it sits atop the 48th floor of the Kohinoor Square in Dadar. Offering a rooftop view of Mumbai and its beauty, Shilpa Shetty’s restaurant isn’t just about good food but also a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience.\n“The kind of money in Mumbai is astonishing. One single restaurant in Mumbai has a turnover of ₹2-3 crore a night. On a slow night, the turnover is ₹2 crore, and on weekends it’s ₹3 crore. I walked into the restaurant to see it myself when I heard these numbers… I said this can’t be true,” said De.\nShobhaa De recently spoke on a podcast, Inside Out With Barkha Dutt, where she revealed that she had heard a lot about Shetty’s restaurant and wanted to check it out herself. What she discovered was unbelievable to her. Earning over ₹2 crore on average is an impossible sum of money for a restaurant, even as luxurious as the Bastian.\nShilpa Shetty’s restaurant is a big success\nRaj Kundra’s Bastian at the Top was established in 2023, and to see this level of success in only two years is a big deal. The restaurant, according to Shobhaa De, can seat up to 1400 guests with two seating sessions. That is, 700 guests in one go. Even with so many available seats, the waiting line is impossibly long.\n“They were young, and they were ordering bottles and bottles of the best line tequila for the table. Each table was spending in lakhs, but they were complete strangers,” De revealed.\nPeople are waiting in luxurious cars and long lines across Dadar to get into the exclusive restaurant, with reservation lists just as intimidating. The author was shocked to see people spending lakhs upon lakhs of money on exclusive food. It is obvious now that people don’t shy away from spending money in Shilpa Shetty’s restaurant.\nHeader and Social Image Credits: Instagram/theshilpashetty and Instagram/bastianmumbai\nRead iDiva for the latest in Bollywood, fashion looks, beauty and lifestyle news.",
