  "text": "12,000 Visitors, including Kendall Jenner\\nNew York Times Square Advertisement is also underway\\nMedicube Strengthens Global Position 사진 확대 MediCube New York Pop-up Store, USA. [Picture = APR] More than 12,000 people visited the pop-up store held in New York, USA by APR's beauty brand MediCube.\nAPR announced on the 13th that it held a MediCube offline pop-up store in Broadway, New York, USA from the 24th of last month to the 2nd of this month. APR has planned offline marketing campaigns such as pop-up stores to strengthen brand awareness and raise buzz in the region ahead of the special shopping period in the U.S., such as Black Friday promotions and Christmas scheduled for the fourth quarter.\nAt this pop-up store, you could experience a variety of popular MediCube cosmetics and MediCube AGR beauty devices. As a result, more than 12,000 local consumers of various races visited the store. In particular, during the pop-up period, Kendall Jenner, a famous American model who is known to enjoy using MediCube products, visited the site and experienced MediCube's cosmetics and beauty devices in person.\nAmong the pop-up store spaces, Arcade Zone implemented four main modes of AGR's flagship product, 'Booster Pro', as arcade games. The main mode of the arcade game console and booster pro was combined so that visitors could naturally learn about the principles and efficacy of each mode while enjoying the game.\n사진 확대 MediCube Outdoor Advertising in Times Square, New York, USA. [Picture = APR] APR also promoted the brand by conducting outdoor advertisements for MediCube throughout the city, including Times Square and subways in New York. The ad has a catchphrase called \"Glow out loud.\" It introduced products such as \"AGR Booster Pro,\" \"PDRN Pink Peptide Ampoule,\" and \"Zero Pore Pad,\" creating a scene where you get glowing skin. Advertising videos were sent to a total of 500 accounts on major subway lines, including five large electronic boards in Times Square.\n\"This New York pop-up store and outdoor advertising campaign was a step to further strengthen brand influence in the U.S. market beyond just promoting products,\" an APR official said. \"We will firmly establish MediCube's brand position by communicating with local consumers in various ways next year, including the upcoming special period at the end of the year.\"\n사진 확대 Kendall Jenner visiting the scene of the MedyCube pop-up store in New York, USA.
