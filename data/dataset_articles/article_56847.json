  "text": "Christmas decor is heading back to the '90s , with social media declaring 2025 is the year of nostalgic Christmas .\nForget the beige tree with perfectly curated decorations and muted tones throughout – people are throwing it back, going bold with colour and embracing the mismatched chaos of three decades ago.\nA quick look through Instagram and TikTok confirms the trend is taking over, with many millennials reverting to the aesthetic of their childhood Christmases.\nThe nostalgic aesthetic of '90s Christmas is back! (TikTok/@mellymaysworld) Nostalgia has a strong pull, and this bold Christmas trend really taps into it.\nBut why now?\nMany millennials are looking for a way to give their kids a taste of the Christmas they grew up with.\n﻿If Christmas holds a special place in your heart, you're probably going to try and do anything to give your kids the same memories, which starts with the décor.\nREAD MORE: Aldi Christmas buy sending shoppers into a frenzy\nREAD MORE: $12 hack you'll be seeing on plenty of front doors this Christmas﻿\nREAD MORE: Black Friday deals have dropped early ﻿\nUnable to display TikTok on this browser \"﻿Guys it's finally done!! what do you think of our tacky nostalgic Christmas theme this year!\" one woman wrote on TikTok .\nOthers are just sick of the 'sad beige' trend that's taken over homes in recent years, reverting to big, bold colour.\n\"I don't want to see a single sad beige Christmas this year! Got it!!!\" wrote mum Jenna alongside a TikTok of herself styling her home.\n\"This room literally makes me feel like I should be baking gingerbread men and stringing popcorn.﻿\"\nPeople are dressing their trees in tinsel, paper garlands and embracing the clashing – and kitsch – decorations to create a look that stands out and is full of personality.\nTinsel, whether it be the traditional fluffy garlands wrapped around the tree or delicate strands of the metallics draping over every branch, are one of the biggest factors in nailing the trend.\nTinsel, whether it's strands of it or the big fluffy strands, are a must. (Getty Images/iStockphoto) It's time to really embrace the festive crafts your kids are going to bring home. (Getty) For those with young kids, it also means putting the handmade decorations from daycare proudly on the tree on display.\nAnd you can forget the warm white lights, the only option is the colourful ones to really add that extra oomph.\nWhen it comes to lights, we have evolved past the '90s but the new colours and LED lights don't necessarily give off the same warm coloured glow of Christmases gone by.\nThankfully, with a bit of creativity, patience and a trip to Kmart one man has shared his hack for creating the closest you can get to them today.\nYou can bring back the glowy, colourful lights with one simple hack. (TikTok/@lachlancrane) You need the warm white lights and another box of coloured ones. Next, you take each coloured globe cover off and replace a warm white light with it.\nThis effect gives your lights that warm, colourful glow so many of us had in our living rooms through the '90s during the festive season.\nWatch the video below. ﻿\nThe other big way to embrace this trend is by bringing back Santa.\nWhether it be figurines, decorations, décor like throw pillows or even garlands, Santa is the face that should be dominating it all.\nWhile it may feel tacky, that 'tacky' is peak nostalgia; we all have memories of Santa adorning at least something in our homes as soon as Christmas is on the way.\nIf you really want to go out, go for festive wall art featuring the big man in red to change out some of the prints in your home for seasonal décor to really amp up the \"more is more\" feeling.\nFor a daily dose of 9honey, subscribe to our newsletter here .\nIt's time to raid your parents' house and whip out the retro Christmas knick knacks. (Getty) Also, garlands – put them everywhere.\nHang a garland from a doorway, from the ceiling, draped over your stair rail, put them everywhere. The only way to make these better, decorate them.\nNow, this is where you can lean into the DIY retro vibes and make your own paper chain garlands, which is an easy way to incorporate your colour palette in.\nOr you can go down the road of faux greenery, adding the additions of bows, bells and baubles.\nOne of the big things to focus on when you're trying to recreate the '90s Christmas is that it does not have to be perfect.\nThe tree can be full of colour and texture. Think: baubles and decorations mixed together, different sizes and even different shapes. Add your lights and then, of course, tinsel – whether it be the little delicate strands of silver or the garland.\n15 ways to save money this Christmas View Gallery By going big and bold you're leaning into the colour and the fun.\nAnd let's be honest, in the '90s no one was taking pictures of their tree to show off online – it was for the Christmas spirit and to really show up your family, or neighbours if they were coming around.\nFOLLOW US ON WHATSAPP HERE : Stay across all the latest in celebrity, lifestyle and opinion via our WhatsApp channel.
