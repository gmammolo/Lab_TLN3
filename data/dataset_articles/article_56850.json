  "text": "By Rhiannon Evans ,\n9 minutes ago A composite of a Lego Nike trainer, a smartwatch and a coffee cup Jellycat surrounded by illustrated gift boxes Composite: Sandra Navarro/Guardian Design Struggling to buy a present for an 11-year-old – secondary school kids no longer young but also not fully fledged teens? Who better to ask for ideas than a group of their own peers?\nWe picked the brains of 11-year-olds from around the country for the best gifts for tweens their age. From skincare to fitness tech, today’s preteens are a cultivated bunch (and know their way around the words “trending” and “collab”). Read on for their best gifts.\n*** The best gifts for 11-year-olds *** Get ready Sterling silver heart set\n£30 at John Lewis £35 at Next Pandora heart charm\n£29 at Pandora Dressing table with mirror\n£102.99 at Wayfair I would love a heart-shaped matching necklace and earring set or a Pandora charm. When I wear jewellery, it reminds me of the person who gave it to me, and I feel really grateful and happy.\nI would love a dressing table to put in my bedroom so I can organise all my jewellery, nail varnishes, hair scrunchies and sprays. Sitting at my dressing table getting ready each morning will make me smile before I start the day! Simran\n*** Watch out Apple Watch SE 2\n£159 at Argos £179 at Amazon I’m a big football fan – our Fulham season tickets are my pride and joy – and I want an Apple Watch to track fitness, set training timers, and message my parents after practice. Matthieu\n***\nWicked clothes Knitted sweater\n£35.99 at Mango We Believe in Glinda body spray\n£32 at Lush I love getting clothes as gifts. I really like this jumper because of the colour, which goes well with jeans. The style of the zip and neckline are really cool, and I love the knitted look. I’m also really excited for Wicked 2, and this We Believe in Glinda body spray looks amazing. Marianne\n*** Flashy fun Portable Bluetooth karaoke machine\n£19.99 at Robert Dyas £23.99 at Currys Slush Puppie machine\n£29.99 at Smyths Wifi light strips\n£27.99 at Amazon I’ve asked for a karaoke machine. It’s something you can do with family and friends if there are two microphones. A slushie maker would also be a taste sensation, and it avoids all those nasty chemicals too! I’d really like some LED lights; they make a kid’s room fun but also calm at night. Felix\n*** Snap happy Instax camera\n£74.99 at Boots £73.98 at Amazon I’d love a dog, but I know that’s a long shot. If not, I’d like a Fujifilm camera because I like to look back at all my memories. Elsie\n*** Dress to impress Brandy Melville sweater\n£30 at Brandy Melville Brandy Melville jogging bottoms\n£30 at Brandy Melville Adidas Gazelles\n£45 at Schuh £55 at Adidas Jellycat bag charm\n£23 at Urban Outfitters £25 at JD Williams I’d like trending clothes, shoes and Jellycats. We like trending stuff as we want to look cool and fashionable. Jellycats are trending, but they’re also super cute. Sasha\n*** Make scents Sol de Janeiro set\n£31.20 at John Lewis £39 at Boots I would like a set of perfumes by Sol de Janeiro called Spritz the Season, because they smell very nice. It’s a popular brand for young girls, so lots of people would like them. Jess\n*** Fit in Samsung Galaxy Fit3 watch\n£44 at Argos £44 at Samsung I would really like a smartwatch because they look cool, and I like to know how many steps I do. Kai\n***\nMade up Flat Lay Co makeup bag\n£18.74 at Lookfantastic £25 at M&S I would really like a fold-out makeup and wash bag because they’re really useful and pretty. They can store loads of things, then fold back into the size of a normal makeup or wash bag. Skye\n*** Rock on Lego Nike\n£34.99 at Lego £34.99 at Nike Percy Jackson book set\n£10 at the Works £16.55 at Amazon I’d like something from the Nike Lego collab sets, the Percy Jackson book series and some concert tickets. Evan\n*** Lululemon and Lottie Brooks Lululemon flared trousers\n£108 at Lululemon K-pop Demon Hunters sweatshirt\n£19.99 at Zara The Mega-Complicated Crushes of Lottie Brooks\n£4.57 at Amazon £4.99 at Scholastic Byoma universal skincare heroes set\n£22 at Boots £22 at Amazon Heatless curlers\n£10 at Boots I’d love new clothes – I like White Fox, Lululemon and would also like a K-pop hoodie. I’d like the next Lottie Brookes book in the series, and Byoma skincare: it makes my skin look and feel nice. I love hair products too, so some heatless curlers.
