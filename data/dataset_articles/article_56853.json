  "text": "Decatur’s culinary scene will have more offerings with new restaurants and a supermarket opening in the city.\nLa Terrazita Mexican Grill, located on U.S. 31 South, will have its grand opening Monday, after launching a soft opening in October. The restaurant is styled after the terraces in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. Furniture and decorations were custom-made in Mexico and brought to Decatur to create a more authentic and inviting atmosphere.\nThe menu includes a combination of more authentic Mexican dishes and Tex-Mex style food. The restaurant’s owners bring years of experience. They opened La Terraza in Starkville, Mississippi, about 15 years ago. La Terraza also has two other locations in Mississippi.\nOver time, Pablo Jaime, one of the owners, said they hope to introduce the Decatur community to even more authentic Mexican meals by expanding their menu. Everything is homemade from the tortillas and salsa to the tamales and even the burger patties for La Terrazita’s Mexican burger.\nMore than just a place to grab a meal, Jaime said he wants to create a place where people can gather and truly connect whether indoors or on the patio, which has heaters for colder days. The restaurant is a family business. Jaime’s father and stepmother are the other two owners.\nThe project took nearly three years from start to completion to ensure that everything was made with care. Pablo Jaime said he is excited to share La Terrazita’s food with Decatur. His favorite menu items are the tacos, which he said are one of the most authentic dishes offered. They follow the recipe of the street tacos sold by taqueros in Mexico.\nLa Terrazita also has a drive-thru.\nDecatur residents Margaret Emery and Page Dunlap tried La Terrazita for the first time this week. Emery said she’s a big fan of Mexican food. She ordered enchiladas. Dunlap tried the melty grilled pollo.\n“It was very tasty,” Dunlap said.\nShe also loved the salsa and thin, crispy tortilla chips. Both Dunlap and Emery plan to return. They enjoyed the atmosphere and said their waiter helped them decide what to order.\nPizza Roma will also be coming to Decatur after serving up Detroit-style pizza in Somerville for years. The Somerville location will still be open, as well. Owner Mike Shallal also has plans to open a Pizza Roma in Cullman. Opening dates have not been announced yet.\nShallal began making pizza at a young age with his father. He ran a pizza restaurant in Detroit for over 25 years before he and his wife moved to Alabama.\nPizza Roma’s menu includes pizza, subs, calzones, different breads, salads, wings and desserts.\nD Diaz Supermarket broke ground Tuesday. The building will be constructed at 1931 Central Parkway in Decatur, next to REACH Pediatric Therapy Services.\nOwner Adan Zaragoza also owns Zaragoza’s Supermarket in Decatur and El Patrón Supermarket in Huntsville.\nD Diaz Supermarket will have a meat counter, bakery, tortilla shop, taqueria shop and freshly cooked Mexican and Central American dishes, in addition to other grocery items.\nZaragoza expects the building process to take about a year. The store will offer a larger Central American market than Decatur currently has.\nThe store aims to offer authenticity and convenience for shoppers. In addition to serving the Hispanic community, D Diaz can also be a spot for people to discover new flavors.\nThe Decatur-Morgan County Chamber of Commerce also has a ribbon cutting ceremony for Keith Jackson Leadership on Wednesday.\nKeith Jackson, who started Jackson Plumbing, Heating and Cooling, first became interested in the leadership space in 2015. When he began to develop himself, his company started to grow.\n“It was amazing. All I did was I started working on me, then I started getting my girls and guys interested in personal development and started teaching leadership within the shop, then all of the sudden, it was amazing how everybody began to transform,” Jackson said.\nHe has since retired from the plumbing industry, but he still carries a passion for personal development. He offers one-on-one coaching and group sessions, and he gives presentations about leadership to different companies and organizations.\nLast Thursday, he spoke with the Hartselle Kiwanis Club. On Thursday, he will speak with the Decatur Kiwanis Club.\n“I work with business owners,” Jackson said. “I work with people who are aspiring to be leaders, but I also work with people who just want to grow and develop and be the best version of themselves that they can be.”\nHe is a John Maxwell certified speaker and trainer, and he pulls from Maxwell’s teachings often. He said he started Keith Jackson Leadership to help people and organizations reach their highest potential.\n“I believe that God gave everyone unique abilities and gifts, and my purpose is to help them find them, understand them, develop them, and challenge them to grow,” Jackson said.",
