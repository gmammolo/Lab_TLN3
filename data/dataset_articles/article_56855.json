  "text": "On this date in 1989, Peppie the poodle from Glyndon, Minnesota, was honored in New York City as one of 12 dogs inducted into the first Mighty Dog Hall of Fame for his inspiring rescue story.\nHere is the complete story as it appeared in the paper that day:\nADVERTISEMENT\nSnookie’s Peppie a super puppy\nBy Chet Gebert, STAFF WRITER\nThe ultimate in a dog’s life is coming this week for Peppie the poodle from Glyndon, Minn.\nHe will be flown Tuesday to New York and taken by taxi to the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, where part of a package of goodies will be a personal Pooper Scooper to be used when he’s exercised on Park Avenue.\nThen, Wednesday noon at the Pierre Hotel, Peppie will be inducted into the first Mighty Dog Hall of Fame along with 11 other dogs from across the country. The hall of fame is a promotion of Friskies Pet Care, a division of the Carnation Co., manufacturer of Mighty Dog canned dog food.\nArticle from 13 Nov 1989, Mon The Forum (Fargo, North Dakota)\nThis honor, and more, comes because Peppie’s principal master, Snookie Langseth, entered him in a Carnation contest. She wrote a short essay about him and sent a picture to judges.\nLangseth’s 52-word, prize-winning essay—pared down from a first-effort 150 words—reads:\n“I found a deserted, fuzzy-faced, shaggy-haired dog. He slept outside in the cold snow. He was never allowed inside. I took him home. A bath and a haircut did wonders. Underneath, I found the most wonderful, loveable and appreciative pup. Now he eats Mighty Dog, sleeps and goes everywhere with me.”\nThat summary of how a once-mangy, woodtick- and sandbur-covered dog could become Langseth’s trusty companion apparently were enough for a private judging organization, then people from Carnation to say that he represented qualities that have dubbed dogs “man’s best friend” for years.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA picture of Peppie sitting in the crotch of a box elder tree also figured into the judges determining that he should be among the 12 dogs inducted at a gala event Wednesday. Entertainment personality Tony Randall will be the master of ceremonies as the dogs and their masters parade on a ramp like at fashion shows.\nMarijane Levee, a Carnation public relations representative, said the contest attracted about 5,000 entries. The first judging eliminated all but 100 entries, which then were reduced by Carnation officials to 12 grand prize winners.\nEach top prize is worth $7,000, Langseth said. Peppie, Snookie and her husband, Duane, and her mother, Violet Baron, 1225 12th St. N., Fargo, get all-expense paid trips to New York, where they also will be dined and entertained and get a day of sightseeing.\nPeppie will travel to New York in a portable kennel in the passenger compartment of a Northwest Airlines airplane. “That cost $60 to have Peppie in the cabin with me,” Langseth said.\nIn the Waldorf Astoria, Peppie will be kenneled at times when he’s left alone in the Langseth’s room.\nThis will be quite a contrast to home in Glyndon, where Peppie has the run of the Langseth house and sleeps at the foot of Snookie’s bed after giving her good night kisses.\nLangseth wasn’t totally sold on Peppie after bringing him to Glyndon from a farm near Lisbon, N.D., where a family member no longer could take care of him.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“I brought Peppie to the house and put him on the step. I wasn’t attached to this dog. I hadn’t completely fallen in love with him,” she says.\n“So I told him, ‘You got one chance. You crap in my house—out you go.’\n“He came flying up the steps. He followed me around the house and I followed him because I didn’t know if he had to go to the bathroom. The first time he had to go, he jumped against my leg, took me to the door and out he went.”\nWhen she was going to bed that first night, “he shot past me like a streak in the dark. And he jumped up on the bed and his tail was going to beat 60, like, ‘Hey, this is where I want to sleep.’ And that’s where he’s been ever since.”\nThis will be the first trip to New York for Snookie, whose real first name, Viola, is used only on official documents.\nShe says that, when Peppie is inducted, she will be thinking of the love for dogs that was instilled in her by her father, Ray Baron, who died Nov. 5.\n“So, this award is going to be in his memory,” says Snookie. Her father nicknamed her that when she was a little girl. Only during her school years was she known as Viola.\nADVERTISEMENT",
