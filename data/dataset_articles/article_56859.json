  "text": "A pastry centrepiece so beautiful, you won’t know whether to eat it or hang it on your door\nSponsored by IGA Liquor\nChristmas is a visual feast as much as a culinary one. We string the lights, hang the tinsel and turn our homes into sparkling havens. Why should the food be any different? The most successful holiday appetisers are those that look as incredible as they taste, yet require minimal effort from the host.\nIntroducing your new holiday showstopper: the cranberry and brie wreath. This stunning, savoury-sweet appetiser is crafted from puff pastry, creamy brie and a tangy homemade cranberry-onion jam. Baked to a golden puff, it serves as the perfect edible centrepiece for any table — and only takes 35 minutes to assemble and bake.\nTo complement the rich, buttery pastry and the sweet cheese, you need a drink that offers a palate cleanse without being heavy. The Hahn Refresher is a brilliant, low-carb pairing that cuts through the richness and keeps the vibe light and festive. It’s the ultimate combination to keep your hosting duties breezy.\nCranberry and brie wreath\nPaired with: Hahn Refresher\nServes: 5\nTotal time: 35 mins\nIngredients\n- 1 small red onion, sliced\n- ½ cup whole cranberry sauce\n- 1½ tbsp red wine vinegar\n- ¼ cup water\n- 1 sheet puff pastry, thawed\n- 125g double brie, cubed\n- Rosemary sprigs\n- 1 egg, beaten\n- Fresh Cranberries to garnish\nMethod\n- In a small saucepan, combine the cranberry sauce, vinegar, red onion and ¼ cup of water over medium heat.\n- Cook for 10 minutes, until onions are tender and sauce is jam-like. Set aside to cool.\n- Preheat the oven to 180°C.\n- Lay the pastry on a tray on baking paper. Cut the edges of the square pastry to make a rough circle.\n- Use a smaller plate or bowl to trace an inner circle.\n- Make 4 cuts in the inner circle.\n- Spread the cranberry onion jam around the outer circle leaving a 1-2cm border around the outside.\n- Arrange the slices of brie and rosemary sprigs on top.\n- Fold some of the outer edge of the pastry over the filling, brush with egg.\n- Bring one point of the centre star over to meet it and press together.\n- Continue until you have a wreath, brushing with egg wash as you go.\n- Place wreath in oven for 15-20 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown.\n- Garnish with cranberries and rosemary twigs.\nFor the Hahn Refresher\n- Fill a tall glass with ice.\n- Pour in Hahn Super Dry to about three-quarters filled.\n- Fill glass with lime and soda water.\nWhether you’re wanting the perfect drink to sip, savour or gift this festive season, find what you’re looking for at your local IGA Liquor.\nRemember to drink responsibly.\nThe best recipes from Australia's leading chefs straight to your inbox.\nSign up",
