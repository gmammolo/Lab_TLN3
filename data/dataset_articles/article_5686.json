  "text": "JAN 29, 2026\n(COLUMBIA, S.C.) – Attorney General Alan Wilson announced today he has joined a friend-of-the-court brief with a coalition of 26 attorneys general in support of President Trump’s birthright citizenship executive order.\nOn his first day in office, President Trump issued an executive order to stop automatic birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants and birth tourists. The states highlight significant constitutional and policy concerns as to why President Trump’s policy should be allowed to go into effect.\nThe states’ brief explains that the Fourteenth Amendment never intended to grant automatic citizenship to tourists or illegal aliens who are coming into our country to have children. Recent reporting has raised even more concerns about foreign nationals trying to abuse birthright citizenship for their own purposes. The Supreme Court will likely hear arguments for the case in the spring.\n“The 14th Amendment was enacted to ensure that emancipated slaves were citizens. It was never meant to be a loophole so illegal aliens could have an anchor baby to allow the whole family to stay in the United States of America,” Attorney General Wilson said.\nSouth Carolina joined the Iowa and Tennessee-led brief along with Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, Guam, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\nRead the full brief here.\nFor media inquiries please contact Robert Kittle, [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or 803-734-3670",
