  "text": "Team Islas Marianas embarked on a remarkable journey from the Northern Mariana Islands to the 6th Copa del Mundo Tiro con Honda, the annual Slinging World Cup held on the island of Ibiza, Spain.\nParticipants from more than 30 countries assembled for the five-day event.\nRepresenting the Marianas, the team consisted of Ben “Guelo” Rosario, Roque Dueñas Camacho, Christiana Akie Dueñas and Oliver Josh Taitano Iguel.\nThe slingers competed in multiple categories, including stones, tennis balls and one-minute speed rounds, which led to the main championship event. Beyond the competition, the team attended conferences where slingers from around the world shared research, experiences and cultural traditions, fostering global camaraderie and appreciation for the ancient art of slinging.\nOn Oct. 25–26, Team Islas Marianas proudly represented the islands as they competed alongside the world’s best slingers for a chance to be crowned the 6th Annual Slinging World Cup champion. The competition was held at Reina Sofia Park and at Es Cubells in the municipality of Sant Josep de Sa Talaia. Participants faced four rounds, each consisting of five throws, in both tennis ball and stone categories.\nFollowing a weekend of fierce competition, Team Islas Marianas earned numerous awards across multiple divisions and events. Their dedication and skill brought pride to the Marianas on the world stage.\nTeam Islas Marianas’ individual and team award winners included Camacho, who placed second at the Youth Slinging World Cup. Team Islas Marianas placed third overall at the Slinging World Cup.\nIn the stones competition, Camacho placed first in the youth division, and Christiana Akie Cabrera Dueñas placed second in the women’s division.\nIn several other divisions, Team Islas Marianas also made the podium.\nA special appreciation award was presented to Rosario and Roman Dela Cruz for their dedication to promoting, teaching and preserving the art of slinging across the globe.\nThrough their efforts, the ancient CHamoru practice of stone slinging has been revived and shared with communities in the United States, Japan, Ireland and beyond, gaining new students and cultural ambassadors.\nIn the Northern Marianas, stone slinging has become a symbol of cultural pride and resilience, serving as a bridge to ancestral knowledge and values.\n“Team Islas Marianas extends its deepest appreciation to the organizers and staff of the 6th Annual Slinging World Cup, and especially to Mr. Pep Ribas Ribas, president of the world slinging competition, for hosting such a meaningful and unifying event for slingers around the world,” Dela Cruz said. “We also express our sincere gratitude to our sponsors and supporters who made this journey possible and memorable.\"\nFor making the trip possible, Dela Cruz thanked the following sponsors: The Rota Mayor's Office, especially the Hon. Aubry M. Hocog, The Fokai Shop, TheEffect, The Rota Leadership, Aire Air, AsKar Travels and all other donors and contributors.\n“Your generosity, encouragement and faith in our athletes made this achievement possible,” he said.\n(Daily Post Staff)",
