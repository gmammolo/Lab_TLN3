  "text": "Deer decoys can be productive\nFor some people, autumn includes decorating with items like leaves and pumpkins. While I enjoy fall as much as the next guy, my idea of decorations leans more toward the deer-decoy type.\nDecoys can be a productive strategy at any time of the season. The best time to deploy them is during the rut or the immediate run-up to it. For me, the best time to decoy deer is from the second week in October until the end of bow season.\nWhy this time? Because this is when young bucks are starting to sow their oats, bigger bucks are looking to stake out a territory and then move right into prime breeding season. Using the right decoy at any time during this period will give any deer that passes by a reason to investigate further.\nIf you are looking for your first decoy, I recommend a 3-D target. While there are many different options available, nothing works as well as a lifelike target. Not only does it provide a realistic visual, but it also withstands more abuse than the cardboard or paper versions. Regardless of which decoy you choose, be sure to add a moving tail. I prefer a white washcloth or similar material. This also makes a perfect way to add scent to the decoy.\nWhen placing a decoy, select a location where deer naturally travel. Not only does it increase the chances your decoy will be seen, but it also appears more natural to the real wildlife. Ideally, you want your perfect shoot to occur during the approach, not when your target is right next to the decoy. Placement should also encourage an approaching buck to do so in a manner that maximizes your shooting opportunities, not just a small window right in front of you.\nAs for whether to use a doe or a buck decoy, it depends on what you are targeting and the local activity. A doe is always a good bet once mature bucks are breeding. However, they will also attract younger boys to the area as well. If you choose a buck decoy, do not go for the once-in-a-lifetime realistic decoy. Your best selection is a moderate-sized decoy, with a moderate rake and body size. Too big and you will scare off lesser but legal bucks. Too small and you will draw in every new guy on the block looking to test their mettle.\nWhile using a decoy isn’t a sure thing — no tactic works every time — now is the best time to give it a shot.\n•••\nTom Burrell is a retired Waterways Conservation Officer, veteran and lifelong outdoorsman.
