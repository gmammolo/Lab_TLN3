  "text": "By Wes Adams ,\n3 hours ago\nIf you’re craving something different this Thanksgiving , Colorado’s Western Slope is the perfect place to switch things up. Maybe this is the year you swap the usual turkey routine for a Friendsgiving in wine country—celebrating under wide-open November skies.\nIf a scenic winery near the Colorado River sounds better than stuffing all your friends into your living room for an afternoon, keep scrolling to check out a few Palisade wineries and orchards offering fresh ideas.\nWhy Host Friendsgiving at a Western Colorado Winery or Orchard? Getty Images/iStockphoto Wine country in November comes with all the late-fall and early winter feels, as the Palisade and Grand Junction vineyards have plenty to offer for harvest season. Enjoy locally grown produce, easy access to unique local wines, and a relaxed atmosphere custom-made for relaxing with friends. Hosting them among the Western Colorado orchards and vineyards gives friends and family something extra to remember.\nSuggested Venues for a Western Colorado Friendsgiving Getty Images Here are three standout venues to consider:\nMaison la Belle Vie — Location: 3575 G Road, Palisade, CO 81526. Amenities : A 4.5-acre vineyard with a rustic-elegant tasting room and courtyard (Amy’s Courtyard) that is marketed for private events. They serve charcuterie boards and seasonal menus on-site, offering an upscale yet relaxed setting.\nGrande River Vineyards / Ten Acre Winery — Location: 787 Grande River Drive, Palisade, CO 81526. Amenities : Estate-style vineyard with a fully built event infrastructure—including a hotel next door, private event planning services, and spaces for group gatherings—ideal for a larger Friendsgiving with both wine tasting and communal dinner.\nColterris Winery — Location: 3907 N River Road, Palisade, CO 81526 (also Overlook location: 3548 E½ Road). Amenities : Colorado’s largest fully estate-grown winery, with multiple tasting rooms and scenic options, and capabilities for large-group requests by phone. They offer wine tastings, panoramic views, and flexible event settings.\nLogistics for November Friendsgiving One thing to remember about planning a Friendsgiving is that it happens around Thanksgiving, not during it. Plan a date before or after holiday travel peaks. Mid-November weekends work best. Check to see if the venue you are interested in allows outside catering or has in-house options.\nWill you need to rent tables? What about heaters? Fire pits can make a huge difference if the weather turns chilly. There is a lot to consider, but once the day arrives, you will love that you found a way to create a unique Western Slope experience for your friends.\nGetty Images/iStockphoto Download the KEKB Mobile App Now 15 Colorado Wine Rooms With Near Perfect Reviews Colorado is loaded with awesome wine bars and wine tasting rooms.
