  "text": "By STAFF REPORT ,\n9 hours ago\nMARATHON — Some contests are so fun, even not winning first place doesn’t quite feel like a loss.\nRecently 10 teams of two people had to face off with a ticking clock to consume 25 fresh stone crab claws apiece, according to a news release.\nIt took place Nov. 1, at the 14th annual Stone Crab Eating Contest at Keys Fisheries in Marathon.\n“The goal? Crack and consume 25 tasty stone crab claws and pick them completely clean in the fastest time possible,” it noted. “Participants received a penalty for each piece of claw meat left behind.”\nContestants brought along hammers, mallets and nut crackers. But it was a spoon — a very large spoon — that helped a Lee County man take the top prize, according to the news release.\n“So, my strategy was a spoon — a lot bigger of a spoon,” said first-place winner Jonathan Martinescu of Fort Myers. “Two years ago, I actually used a smaller spoon so this year the secret was a bigger spoon.”\nIt was Martinescu second time in the contest. He won in 9 minutes and 46 seconds on his four-year wedding anniversary.\n“The top three winners and teams took home commemorative awards including a Florida Keys gift basket,” it noted.\nOfficials note the Florida Keys are responsible for about 40% of the state’s stone crab harvest. It’s about 2 million pounds annually, according to Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n“Stone crabs are also considered a renewable resource because of the crabs’ ability to re-grow harvested claws,” it noted.\nStone crab harvest season runs Oct. 15 to May 1 each year.",
