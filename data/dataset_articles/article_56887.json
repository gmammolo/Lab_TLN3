  "text": "Brazos Valley sausage company helps ‘meat’ the need for fresh food options in Calvert\nCALVERT, Texas (KBTX) - For over a decade, Calvert residents have had limited access to fresh food options, but a new local business is now offering a beacon of hope.\nThe nearest grocery store to Calvert is a ten-mile journey to Hearne. This distance has left many relying on the local food pantry and the limited, often processed, options available at convenience stores like Family Dollar.\nThe lack of fresh produce and meat, coupled with higher prices, has created a “food desert” environment, making it extremely difficult for families, especially those without reliable transportation, to prepare healthy meals.\nMina Davis, founder of the Valley of Hope Food Pantry, has observed this pattern across rural Central Texas and has made it her mission to help fill that gap.\n“There are systems and barriers in place that really make it difficult,” Davis stated. “Beyond our elderly, we do have a lot of working families, families with children. It makes it extremely difficult to pick the best and the most affordable options to make it stretch.”\nGroholski Sausage Retail Market, owned by Kenneth Groholski, recently opened its doors in downtown Calvert, aiming to combat these food desert conditions.\nGroholski witnessed the need firsthand while working in the Calvert School District years ago and is now providing access to fresh cuts of meat, produce, and local goods directly to the community.\n“We’re very fortunate and grateful to be here, number one, and it is just nice to be able to try to provide some services and some friendship for folks to come in and offer quality products to everyone,” Groholski shared.\nOpen seven days a week, the market offers residents the opportunity to shop for fresh groceries that have been out of reach for over ten years. They sell both fresh and frozen meats, cheeses, produce, seasonings, and a variety of other food options.\nDavis said she views the new meat shop as more than just a convenience; it represents a crucial step towards improving food access in Calvert.\n“It attracts other retailers because what starts to happen is someone may say, ‘Oh, they’re downtown in the space.’ Then maybe I could do something in a boutique model of being able to sell groceries. It is not a competition. It’s more so an encouragement,” she explained.\nGroholski echoed this sentiment and expressed his satisfaction in being able to provide this much-needed service.\nGroholski hopes this is just the beginning, with plans to forge partnerships with local farmers to further expand the market’s offerings and continue to nourish the Calvert community.\nCopyright 2025 KBTX.
