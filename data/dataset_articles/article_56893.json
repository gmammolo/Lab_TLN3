  "text": "Visitors to one of Leicestershire’s most visited parks can now sample the benefits of an exciting new partnership between Leicestershire County Council and the new tenants of Beacon Hill Café.\nOld Pots, which currently operates the popular The Old Post Office Tearoom in Newtown Linford just outside of Bradgate Park, has selected Beacon Hill for its next business venture.\nSet at the lower end of Beacon Hill Country Park, the Leicestershire County Council owned café is fitted with an outdoor seating area and bike racks and is a great spot for a day out in the countryside.\nCouncillor Harrison Fowler, cabinet member for resources, said: “Beacon Hill Café’s popularity has continued to grow and we’re fortunate to have such a well-loved facility within our park.\n“Leasing out this café follows the successful business model we have developed at Snibston Colliery Park in Coalville, and we’re pleased to be welcoming Old Pots to be part of our country parks community.\n“This move will secure long-term benefits for both the council and the leaseholder, and we’re excited to see what this next chapter will bring for Beacon Hill.”\nThe café has been up and running for six years and has become a firm favourite with visitors and was built with a view to becoming a hub for community events and recreational activities like cycling and hiking.\nOld Pots plan to change the name to Beacon Hill Kitchen & Deli where they will offer a variety of drinks, food and homemade cakes for visitors to enjoy - including vegan and gluten free options. Dogs will remain welcome in the deli and there will continue to be table and take-away service.\nCouncil operations came to an end in August in preparation for the new leaseholders to be ready for trading this autumn.\nOld Pots Owner, Claire Bushell said: “We’re thrilled to be opening our second site here in Leicestershire close by The Old Post Office Tearooms. Our independent business is family-run and we are forever grateful to the continued support we have from our customers who like us, have a passion for great coffee and natural landscapes.\n“Beacon Hill is such a beautiful park and to be able to say this is the next part of our journey is very exciting for us. We love what Beacon Hill has to offer and want to continue to provide a welcoming space for visitors, and their four-legged friends too!\n“There are some exciting things to come and we’re looking forward to working closely with the county council and local community groups to ensure the area continues to thrive.”\nThe newly named Beacon Hill Kitchen & Deli is located nearby the Labyrinth trail and children’s play area which are also key features of the Green Flag award-winning site.\nCheck Instagram.com/beaconhillkitchendeli and facebook.com/leicscountryparks for the latest updates.\nBeacon Hill Kitchen Deli is open daily from 9am – 3pm weekdays and 9am – 4pm at weekends.",
