  "text": "14 minutes ago As Thanksgiving nears in Sweetwater, Texas, instructors Lyanna Cintron and Nathan Sheasby from Texas State Technical College’s Culinary Arts program are helping students and home cooks prepare holiday meals. They advise starting with the turkey and recommend brining it with salt, sugar, water, and aromatics for better flavor. The chefs suggest not relying on pop-up thermometers in store-bought turkeys. Instead, they recommend removing the turkey from the oven at 150 degrees Fahrenheit and letting it rest for at least 35 minutes to keep it moist.\nSafety is important, especially when frying turkeys. Sheasby advises against putting a frozen turkey in hot oil and recommends lowering thawed turkeys slowly. For seasoning, Cintron suggests applying spices both on and under the skin.\nThe chefs also highlight the importance of side dishes. Cintron suggests making cranberry sauce with cranberries and orange marmalade. Sheasby recommends using turkey drippings to moisten stuffing. For mashed potatoes, Cintron uses warm heavy cream and a ricer for texture. She also prepares collard greens with hamhock instead of bacon.\nCintron’s favorite holiday dish is curry shrimp, while Sheasby prefers sweet potatoes. The instructors continue to share their cooking advice as the spring semester registration remains open at tstc.edu.\nVisit here for more details This post includes content assisted by AI tools.
