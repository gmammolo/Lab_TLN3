Years later, that same voice has become her strength. The actor has now collaborated with Meta as the new voice of its AI assistant across multiple countries, marking a major milestone in her journey of self-acceptance.\nSpeaking at CNBC’s Global Leadership Summit, Deepika reflected, “I am someone whose voice was sort of mocked when I came into the industry, and now suddenly I am the voice of Meta AI — strange! And my accent, but I continue to own it. I think that’s probably how and why it happened.” Her words highlight how traits that were once seen as flaws can, over time, become defining strengths when embraced with confidence.\nBeyond her personal story, Deepika also spoke about artificial intelligence and its growing presence in creative spaces. “I am so excited about the possibilities,” she said, “the only thing I believe it cannot replace is human emotion. I think that is the only place where AI will not be allowed or will not be able to match up. Barring human emotion and how an actor would emote, because you can’t infuse soul into AI.”\nGurleen Baruah, existential psychotherapist at That Culture Thing, tells indianexpress.com, “It takes a lot of courage to own something that was once a source of shame. When Deepika says she continues to own her accent, it’s not just about her voice; it’s about identity. Our voice carries our history, our roots, the families and places we come from.”\nSo when someone accepts their natural way of speaking, she adds, they are really saying, this is who I am, and I’m okay with it. When that happens, confidence starts to feel more stable — not performance-based but anchored in self-acceptance. That’s the turning point, when what once felt like a flaw becomes “signature style”.\n“AI can sound human, but it can’t feel human,” stresses Baruah, adding that a real voice carries breath, pauses, tremors — all the little cracks that come from lived experience. You can hear grief in someone’s tone even if they don’t say it out loud; you can sense excitement or exhaustion. That’s the nervous system speaking as much as the mind.\nAI, however, can copy patterns of emotion, but it doesn’t have a body, or memory, or consciousness. Human voices come with context — a lifetime behind every word. That’s the “soul” she’s talking about — presence that can’t be programmed.\nAccording to Baruah, workplaces need to move away from the idea that there’s one “neutral” or “standard” way to sound. There isn’t. Our accents are part of who we are — they hold culture, belonging, and individuality. When people are asked to mask that, it creates quiet shame and distance from self.\n“Simple things help: awareness sessions on communication bias, celebrating language diversity, or just leaders being mindful about who gets interrupted or corrected for “sounding different.” When people feel safe to speak in their own voice, they bring more honesty, creativity, and warmth to the table — things no AI or polished accent can replace,” concludes the expert.",
