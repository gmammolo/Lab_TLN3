  "text": "Greece is experiencing a remarkable winter boost as it sees an 11.8% increase in scheduled airline seats from key European markets, including the UK, Germany, Italy, Cyprus, Turkey, France, Spain, and Switzerland. This surge in seat capacity highlights the growing demand for Greece as a prime winter destination, with more travelers choosing to visit its historical sites, picturesque landscapes, and vibrant culture during the colder months. The expanded air access from these countries reflects Greece’s rising appeal in the off-peak season, driven by increased flight frequencies and new routes that cater to winter tourism.\nGreece is witnessing a notable surge in international air traffic for the 2025-2026 winter season, with a marked increase in planned airline seat capacity. According to data, from November 2025 to March 2026, a total of 6.33 million seats are scheduled for international flights to Greece, reflecting an 11.8% rise compared to the previous winter season (2024-2025). This growth underscores Greece’s ability to maintain strong demand even during traditionally slower months, showcasing the country’s enduring appeal as a destination for city breaks, cultural tourism, and winter getaways. Advertisement This surge in airline seat capacity illustrates that Greece is no longer a destination only associated with the summer months. Over the past several years, Greek tourism has expanded beyond the peak summer season, with airlines steadily increasing their flight schedules to Greek destinations during the off-peak months. The growth is attributed to the rising interest in winter tourism, driven by factors such as city breaks, cultural experiences, and short getaways. In fact, Greece has become an attractive option for travelers looking for a winter destination that combines mild weather, rich history, and vibrant city life.\nThe distribution of airline seats over the winter period shows that the months of November and March will be the busiest, representing 21.5% and 22.4% of the total scheduled seats, respectively. These months typically coincide with early winter and spring breaks, during which travelers seek quick getaways. In contrast, December and January show more moderate demand, with 20.4% and 18.3% of the total seats respectively, which is likely linked to the holiday season when many travelers seek destinations with festive activities and mild climates. February remains the quietest month of the winter season, contributing just 17.4% of the total planned capacity. Advertisement Among the leading source countries for inbound tourists to Greece, Germany remains the largest contributor, with 898,693 scheduled seats for the 2025-2026 winter season, representing a 9.8% increase compared to last year. Other key source markets for Greece include: United Kingdom: 533,571 seats (+4.0% compared to last year) Italy: 524,365 seats (+5.4%) Cyprus: 493,383 seats (stable) Turkey: 394,541 seats (+8.8%) Israel: 381,676 seats (+27.3%) France: 267,690 seats (+11.0%) Spain: 241,654 seats (+37.9%) Switzerland: 230,600 seats (+1.9%) Poland: 208,265 seats (+44.7%)\nAmong these countries, Poland and Spain stand out with the most impressive growth rates. Poland, in particular, has experienced a remarkable increase in planned seats, driven by the expansion of low-cost carriers and the launch of new direct flights to Greece. Similarly, Spain has seen substantial growth, which can be attributed to the increasing popularity of Greek destinations for Spanish travelers, who have become more accustomed to budget-friendly travel options. This growth is a direct result of increased connectivity and expanded low-cost airline networks across Europe, offering more choices for travelers seeking affordable, direct routes to Greece. Advertisement The weekly seat capacity shows a steady increase over the course of the winter season. In the early weeks of November, 338,678 seats are scheduled, and by mid-December, this number rises to 278,757 seats. On average, the period between November and December will see around 300,000 seats per week, reflecting a steady demand for travel to Greece. This increase in seat availability is an indication of Greece’s growing appeal as a year-round destination, with airlines responding to the ongoing demand for flights to the country.\nWhen compared to competing Mediterranean destinations, Greece’s winter season capacity increase stands out. While some of its competitors show more modest growth, Greece has achieved an 11.8% increase in seat capacity, outpacing other countries like Spain, Italy, France, and Turkey. For example, Spain, which remains the largest market among Mediterranean countries, is set to offer 43.9 million seats for the winter season, reflecting a growth of 5.2%. In contrast, Greece’s more modest seat numbers—6.33 million—are accompanied by a higher growth rate, highlighting the country’s increasing competitiveness in the winter tourism market. The country is outperforming nearly all major competitors, with the exception of Cyprus (+18.1%) and Malta (+17.2%).\nHere are the growth rates for other major competitors in the Mediterranean region: Turkey: +13.2% Italy: +8.7% France: +3.4% Portugal: +5.3% Spain: +5.2% Greece: +11.8%\nThe trend of increasing seat availability extends beyond Athens, with secondary destinations such as Thessaloniki, Heraklion, Rhodes, and Chania now maintaining direct winter flights to European cities. These secondary cities are benefitting from the expansion of winter tourism and are key players in Greece’s strategy to extend its tourism season beyond the summer. The increased connectivity to these regions provides tourists with more choices and enhances Greece’s appeal as a diverse, year-round destination.\nGreece is seeing an 11.8% increase in scheduled airline seats from major European markets, driven by rising demand for winter tourism and expanded flight options from countries like the UK, Germany, and Italy. This growth highlights Greece’s growing appeal during the off-peak season.\nthe 11.8% growth in scheduled airline seats for the 2025-2026 winter season is a clear indication that Greece is rapidly transforming into a destination for all seasons. The strong markets from Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, combined with rapid growth in Eastern European markets like Poland, are helping to shift demand patterns and balance out the traditionally seasonal nature of tourism in Greece. This growth is not only contributing to Greece’s position as a leading European tourist destination but also underscores its increasing importance in the winter travel market. With continued expansion in seat capacity and direct flight routes, Greece is well on its way to becoming a major year-round tourism hub. Advertisement",
