  "text": "Seasonal & Holidays\n‘One Breath At A Time’: Newtown Instructor Thankful For Her Yoga Community\nFor Elle Kaplan, the connections she's formed through teaching have become a true source of joy.\nNewtown, PA — Thanksgiving is the perfect time to pause and reflect on what brings us joy — from family and friends to meaningful traditions and everyday moments. This year, Patch has partnered with T-Mobile to spotlight the thankful moments that bring our communities together.\nHere’s what Elle Kaplan in Newtown shared. Want to tell us what you’re thankful for? It could be a person, a tradition, or even a small everyday joy — just answer a few questions, and let your community know what matters most to you this year.\nWhat are you most thankful for this year?\nFind out what's happening in Newtownfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nAll the people that I have met teaching yoga.\nWhy does this mean so much to you?\nFind out what's happening in Newtownfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nYoga brings a true sense of community. I am in awe of the kindness, joy and appreciation for one another that is rooted there. It’s an added bonus that my whole family enjoys yoga and we can participate and be a part of a greater and more peaceful, accepting place where there is no judgement. I am so grateful.\nHow has this made a difference in your 2025?\nMeeting people I may not have met otherwise, that are such wonderful people. The fact that my whole [family] can practice yoga together, where we are reminded of the better things in life that truly matter. Especially seeing people so peaceful and at ease after I have taught. Priceless. I currently teach at YogaSix Newtown. I have taught people to be teachers this year. I teach at an adult community where movement is stretching is so important. I have taught at events, including Yoga at The Market, to raise awareness and funds for pancreatic cancer for A Love For Life organization. I had the privilege to teach yoga at the 250th Anniversary of the Navy on the BSS Billings ship. I do warm up stretches for local running races. I share yoga wherever I can. I know it makes a difference one breath at a time.\nWhat do you wish others knew about what you’re thankful for?\nI wish everybody would see the benefits of yoga and the myriad ways that can heal our bodies and our minds. It’s more than a physical practice. It doesn’t matter if you can touch your toes. It brings presence and awareness. It reminds us what matters most in our lives. It makes us a little kinder to ourselves and others. It has made me a better person in every aspect. For that I am grateful. Especially to be able to be with my loved ones fully and completely.\nWhat are you thankful for this year — a business, a community organization, a place, or a person who’s made a difference?
