  "text": "Step into Oz: Grand Hyatt Jakarta unveils a Wicked-themed escape with Universal Pictures\nshare on\nGrand Hyatt Jakarta has teamed up with Universal Pictures for a spellbinding collaboration inspired by Wicked: For Good, the highly anticipated conclusion to last year’s global cinematic phenomenon.\nThemed experiences will run from 1 November 2025 to 3 January 2026, blending the grandeur of the five-star property with the cinematic wonder of Oz.\nThe partnership marks a creative move for Grand Hyatt Jakarta, bridging hospitality and pop culture through immersive storytelling. Guests can book the exclusive Wicked: For Good staycation package, which promises a “wickedly enchanting journey from the moment they check in,” the company said.\nDon't miss: Grand Hyatt Hong Kong unveils 3D culinary magic at the table\nThe first 20 bookings will receive two complimentary tickets to the official movie premiere on 15 November 2025, offering a rare opportunity to witness the spectacle ahead of its 19 November theatrical release.\nSubsequent guests will also enjoy complimentary cinema tickets for screenings at Plaza Indonesia XXI’s Studio Deluxe, ensuring everyone can share in the magic.\nTo elevate the experience further, the staycation includes a Wicked: For Good Afternoon Tea at the Fountain Lounge, featuring “a curated selection of sweet and savoury delights inspired by the film.”\nGuests are also invited to the exclusive film-themed Cocktail Hour, where they can sip on shimmering elixirs “that pay homage to the wonders of Emerald City.”\nThe collaboration underscores Grand Hyatt Jakarta’s reputation for blending luxury hospitality with cultural relevance - a positioning that resonates with today’s experience-driven travellers.\nThe initiative reflects how lifestyle brands are leveraging entertainment IPs to create fresh consumer engagement and cross-industry visibility. By aligning with a beloved global property such as Wicked, Grand Hyatt Jakarta positions itself at the intersection of film, fantasy, and luxury living - turning its suites and lounges into extensions of the cinematic world.\nGrand Hyatt Jakarta was constructed in 1987 and officially opened its doors to the public in 1991.
