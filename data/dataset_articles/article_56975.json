  "text": "Latest update November 13th, 2025 12:30 AM\nNov 13, 2025\nNews\n(Kaieteur News) – Vreed-en-Hoop junction vendors in Region Three have received a last-minute reprieve, allowing them to continue trading throughout the Christmas season, after a wave of confusion and public complaints.\nThe decision follows uproar from vendors who, on November 5, were issued notices by the Neighbourhood Democratic Council (NDC) ordering them to vacate the area within three days. Vendors reported a frustrating cycle of misdirection: the NDC claimed it had no authority over the order, while the relevant ministry initially failed to address their concerns. However, according to the vendors, after meeting with authorities this week, they were finally told they would be allowed to continue selling at the junction.\nOne vendor, speaking on the A Partnership for National Unity (APNU) Facebook page, detailed the confusion surrounding the removal notice. “I was kind of shocked to know why the NDC gave me a notice, the next morning, I saw the girl (officer of the NDC) over the road, I asked her what is the reason for this notice, she said, she don’t know, we got to go to Town or Region (RDC) . We go to the Region, they don’t know, they say go to Town. When we go to Town, couple of the vendors go to Town. They said when they went and go to Mr. Edhill office, some vendors said Mr. Edghil was right in his office, hiding from them, Now, since they gave me this notice, we went on the TV station, we went in the paper and nobody didn’t come and speak to us and ask what’s going on,” the vendor explained.\nWhen contacted, Region Three Chairman Sheik Ayube confirmed that the NDC had not authorised the removal of the stalls. “It’s not the NDC, it’s Public Works,” he clarified. However, attempts to reach Minister of Public Works Juan Edghill for a comment proved unsuccessful.\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
