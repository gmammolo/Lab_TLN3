  "text": "Family planting seeds 'for a sustainable future'\nA family say they are hoping to make a difference for generations to come by collecting tree seeds and growing them.\nVictoria and her three daughters, have been gathering seeds to replant at home so the saplings can be sold for other people to plant and grow.\nShe said growing and planting would help her daughters learn how to \"provide and to sustain for future generations\".\n\"Our children are providing for our children's children's children, so hopefully the world with our little bit of help is going to be sustained,\" Victoria said.\nShe said the idea to collect seeds came from various nature challenges the family took on for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) last year.\nNow, during Autumn, they are collecting seeds like conkers, maple. sycamore, chestnut and oak.\nThe money they raise by growing plants is reinvested in supplies for the project, Victoria said.\nDakota, 9, said seeing the seeds grow into trees was \"fascinating\" and she loved being outdoors in the fresh air.\nCelestine, 5, added she enjoyed being able to \"run around and at the same time collect stuff\".\nVictoria said the family settled better when they were working with nature and that allowed them to get on with other parts of their lives \"more fluently\".\n\"They're only little for a certain amount of time and having those memories together that we're creating is really special for us\" she said.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook and Instagram.
