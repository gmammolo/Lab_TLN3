  "text": "Team Fox Kandy\nStaff with clergy\nFox Kandy by Fox Resorts celebrated its 6th anniversary, marking another milestone in its journey as one of Kandy’s leading boutique hotels. Since opening its doors in 2019, Fox Kandy has become known for its warm Sri Lankan hospitality, exceptional guest experiences, and strong commitment to community engagement.\nThe anniversary celebrations began with a multi-religious ceremony held at the resort premises, with the management and all staff coming together to invoke blessings for continued success and prosperity. The morning’s proceedings reflected a spirit of gratitude, unity, and shared purpose.\nFollowing the ceremony, the Fox Kandy team gathered for a special staff lunch, celebrating the dedication and teamwork that have been at the heart of the resort’s success. The day concluded with a dinner hosted for the children of Sarana Sewana, a local orphanage in Kandy, reflecting Fox Kandy’s ongoing commitment to giving back to the community.\n“Our anniversary is not just a celebration of years passed—it’s a reflection of the values that guide us: hospitality, inclusivity, and community,” said Group CEO Suresh Srinivasan. “At Fox Kandy, we take pride not only in the experiences we offer our guests but also in the positive impact we create beyond our walls.”\n“Celebrating six years of Fox Kandy is truly special,” said Fox Resorts CEO Chris Quyn. “This milestone reflects our commitment to creating\nmemorable experiences for our guests and building meaningful connections with the community. As we enter our seventh year, we look forward to welcoming more travelers and sharing unforgettable moments.”\nAs Fox Kandy steps into its seventh year, the resort continues to uphold Fox Resorts’ mission of delivering authentic Sri Lankan experiences while fostering a culture of compassion and excellence.",
