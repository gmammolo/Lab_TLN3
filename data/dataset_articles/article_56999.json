  "text": "Can walking 10,000 steps a day also be the secret to getting rich? Gurmeet Chadha, a respected Indian fund manager and CIO of Complete Circle Wealth Solutions, thinks so — and his unique comparison between health and wealth has caught everyone’s attention online. Taking to X, he drew an unexpected but clever link between daily discipline, fitness, and financial success.Chadha explained that walking 10,000 steps every day adds up to 36,000 kilometres over 15 years — the same as walking from Delhi to New York three times. In the same way, he said, investing ₹10,000 a month through a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and increasing it by 10 per cent each year can grow into ₹1 crore in 15 years. The point? Small, consistent steps — whether in fitness or finance — compound into big results over time.He also shared how consistency applies to learning and professional growth. Reading just one research report a week would mean going through around 500 companies in 10 years, a habit that can dramatically sharpen investing insight.Internet reactsSeveral users were quick to respond to Gurmeet Chadha’s post, calling it both relatable and inspiring. One user described it as deeply motivational, appreciating how it perfectly captured the power of compounding through small, consistent actions. Another shared a personal experience, saying they had been walking exactly 10,000 steps every day for the past six months and had seen how steady effort truly leads to meaningful change over time.Others joined in with similar reflections. One user explained how they began with a simple goal of reading one investing article every day. At first, it didn’t seem like much, but over the years, that small habit completely reshaped their understanding of finance and wealth creation. The idea that minor, consistent actions can transform long-term outcomes resonated strongly across the thread.Another user applauded the post for its practical wisdom, pointing out that it aligns perfectly with the philosophy of Kaizen — the Japanese principle of continuous, incremental improvement. Many agreed that Chadha’s analogy served as a refreshing reminder that both financial success and personal growth are built step by step, not overnight.How to build wealth?CA Nitin Kaushik, in a tweet, had outlined four lessons for building financial strength at home. Save with confidence, not fear, so children learn to see money as an opportunity, not a limitation. Invest for growth instead of mere safety to model long-term thinking. Don’t tie money to social image, as chasing status breeds insecurity. And finally, handle finances with balance and calm, teaching that peace matters as much as prosperity.For Kaushik, real wealth lies in the mindset passed down — one rooted in confidence, contentment, and emotional security rather than anxiety or comparison.",
