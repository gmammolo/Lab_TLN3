She also advised that ladies work on their confidence level.\nShe wrote;\nThis is for my ladies”¦\nHey girl, I know that you`ve been taught to show up for others before you have value. You`ve been trained to be good to your parents, kids and partners to have worth. Other people`s opinion shouldn`t drown you. Don`t be terrified to try because others will disapprove. Build your self confidence. Breathe girl! LIVE! Take that step in what God has called you to do! Do the stuff you need to do to succeed.\nTag 2 girl that need to hear this ???? #OMoney #TheMoneyYear #AllGasNoBrakes\nSee post below;\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Omoni Oboli (@omonioboli)",
