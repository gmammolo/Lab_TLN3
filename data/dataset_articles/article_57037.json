  "text": "A full-fat V8 up front, two doors, and that healthy dollop of power and twist flowing to the back. This is the very simple recipe of creating a muscle car, one that has not deviated over its decades of history. They have always been accessible performance for the everyday man. Ford's non-V8-powered Mustang sells for just over $30K, but why would that ever be a consideration when this Motown creation with a hefty 6.2-liter lump up front comes in for just under that mark?\n- Parent Corporation\n-\nGeneral Motors - Divisions\n- Chevrolet Performance\n- Founded\n- 1911\n- Founder\n- Louis Chevrolet and William C. Durant\n- Headquarters\n- Detroit, Michigan\n- Current CEO\n- Mary Barra\nFor less than the price of a new Camry (around $30,000), this full-fat V8 muscle option can deliver as many thrills as its contemporaries at a fraction of the price.\nThe 5th-Gen Camaro SS Still Packs a Genuine V8 Punch for New Base Camry Money\nThere aren’t many cars left that can make you feel like you’re sitting on top of Detroit’s golden era for less than the price of the eternally reliable Toyota Camry. Yet, somewhere in the used car market, a full-fat American V8 is waiting to deliver on the experience resoundingly. The muscle car certainly isn't dead; there are choices out there that warrant consideration, but the used market is abuzz with models from not too long ago that have become absolute bargains.\nThat’s where one unsung hero of the modern era comes in. For around $25,000–$30,000, the final model year 2015 Chevrolet Camaro SS debuted as the last of the 5th-generation. It is only 10 years old, but it's a machine with over 400 horsepower, a 6.2-liter naturally aspirated V8, rear-wheel drive, and looks that hark back to its rich history.\n2015 Chevrolet Camaro SS Specs\n|\nEngine |\n6.2-liter naturally aspirated V8 |\n|\nPower |\n426 hp |\n|\nTorque |\n420 lb-ft |\n|\n0-60 mph |\n4.5 seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n155 mph |\nOn the topic of that naturally aspirated V8, it's the same LS3 that powered the C6 Corvette (but only between 2008 and 2013), pumping out 426 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque in manual form.\nNot all Camaros were created equally, though, since the two-pedal automatic only churned out 400 hp, and not from the LS3 but the L99 instead. There were also different levels of trim available to buyers at the time. The 1SS was the simplest and most affordable, devoid of many luxuries and accouterments, but it still packed the 6.2-liter LS3 punch in manual guise. The 2SS built on that with premium touches like leather-appointed seats, a heads-up display, Boston Acoustics audio, and extra tech features. Meanwhile, the 1SS RS combined the base SS’s muscle with the RS appearance package for a sportier aesthetic.\nPart of GM's legendary small-block family, the ubiquitously used LS3 is wildly reliable and tunable, but more on that later. Transmission options included a 6-speed Tremec manual or a 6-speed automatic with paddle shifters, which was done to equip buyers with the choice of cruiser or old-school engagement.\nIf there’s any doubt about its muscle credentials because the numbers confirm its provenance. Zero to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, a quarter mile in 12.9, and a top speed north of 150 mph. This is now a car that sells for, on average, between $26,000–$28,000, which is exactly in the same ballpark as a 2025 base Toyota Camry LE, which has half the cylinders, twice the number of doors and front-wheel drive.\nDepreciation Hit, So Buyers Get Modern Muscle Performance Without the Modern Price Tag\nWhen it launched in 2015, the Chevrolet Camaro SS had a starting MSRP around $34,500, or roughly $42,000 for a fully loaded 2SS trim. This translates to just under $50k in today's money for the base V8. It wasn’t cheap at the time, but because of its extended age, it undercut the Ford Mustang GT and Dodge Challenger R/T in most configurations while offering Corvette-level performance.\nTen years later, depreciation has worked its magic, at least, for prospective muscle car buyers. Thanks to the arrival of the sharper 6th-gen Camaro and the flood of newer Mustangs and Challengers, values of the 5th-gen SS have plateaued in the sweet spot for enthusiasts. According to aggregator market data, the average sale price of a 2015 Camaro SS sits in the mid-$20,000 range, with clean low-mileage examples occasionally reaching $30k and higher-mileage cars dipping into the low $20s.\nFor comparison, 2015 Dodge Challenger R/T averages hover around $35,000, while 2015 Ford Mustang GT sits closer to $36,000. This makes the Camaro SS one of the cheapest ways to get into a modern, rear-drive, V8-powered performance car from the last decade, and the reason this is important is because it has all the penchants of true muscle without the niggles of a classic. It has enough comfort and modern tech that its predecessors never did. The 2015 SS featured standard Brembo brakes, independent rear suspension, stability control, and a surprisingly composed chassis thanks to GM’s global Zeta platform (shared with the Holden Commodore and Chevrolet SS).\nThe 5th-Gen Camaro SS Is A Pop Culture Icon With Retro Styling\nAlmost every single person who is familiar with pop culture will recognise the 5th-gen Camaro SS. It became an immediate cultural fixture the moment it appeared in Transformers (2007) as Bumblebee, which was crucial in creating the persona that the new Camaro was the face of modern American muscle. That film exposure helped GM rekindle interest in the Camaro name after its early 2000s hiatus, and the styling didn’t disappoint.\nThe 2015 model, being the final iteration of that generation, benefited from subtle refinements which included a sleeker front fascia, sharper lighting elements, and other subtle details. It was a love letter to the first-generation 1969 Camaro. Almost every corner of the car had hallmarks of its antecedent with the squinting headlights, the squared-off haunches, and the low, wide stance.\nMost importantly, it was the interior that benefited the most from modern refinement. It kept that classic-esque driver-focused dash with deep-set gauges, a heads-up display on some trims, and improved materials. Its infotainment system, dated by now, can also be seamlessly replaced with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto units.\nWhy the 5th-Gen Camaro SS Is the Smart Buy for Real Muscle Fans\nThe biggest reason the 2015 Camaro SS deserves attention now is that it represents one of the last affordable V8 muscle cars to be fitted with a large naturally aspirated LS engine, free of turbos or hybrid assistance, in the face of pending electrification mandates. It’s also mechanically simple, with abundant parts availability, strong aftermarket support, and bulletproof reliability when properly maintained.\nThe LS3 engine is one of GM’s most loved powerplants, and for good reason. It can easily surpass 500 horsepower with bolt-ons and a tune, and it’s known to exceed 200,000 miles with basic upkeep. That makes it not just a fun purchase, but also potentially a smart long-term investment for enthusiasts who actually want to drive their cars rather than store them.\nThen there’s the future classic argument. The 5th-gen SS bridges two worlds... It’s modern enough to be practical, but old-school enough to feel mechanical and emotional. After it ceased, only 10 years ago, the automotive world had impetus to shift towards downsized or electrified performance, look at the electrified Charger Daytona EV for example.\nBut, as with everything, this sweet spot might not last forever. Enthusiasts have started to take notice, and clean manual-transmission examples are already seeing slight appreciation trends on Classic.com and Hagerty’s valuation tools, particularly low-mileage 1LE and 2SS variants. It’s not yet collector-grade, but it’s looking like it's heading there...\nDodge And Ford Have Modern Muscle Going For Cheap, Too\nShoppers in the budget modern V8 muscle car segment wanting a different badge can also browse Ford and Dodge. A 2015 Dodge Challenger R/T is bigger, heavier, and more old-school in feel than the Camaro, but under the bonnet is a seismic 5.7-liter HEMI with 375 hp. Prices hover in the low-to-mid $30k range, which is slightly above the Camaro, but it’s the most “retro” choice of the bunch.\nOn the other hand, there is the ubiquitous choice with the 2015 Ford Mustang GT. This was the first year of the new S550 generation, which boasted independent rear suspension and 435 hp from the 5.0-liter Coyote V8. A fantastic all-rounder, but typically $5k–$10k pricier than an equivalent Camaro SS.\nSource: Edmunds, classic.com",
