  "text": "Fact-checked by\nStoyan Todorov\nOntario iGaming Remained Strong in December with Record Revenue Per Player\nOn average, Ontario’s gaming operators earned CAD 334 ($256.3) per player account, up 7% month-on-month and setting a new record\nOntario iGaming has continued to grow, as shown by the latest market report. In 2025, the local online casino sector continued to experience double-digit growth in handle, highlighting the market’s strength.\nOntario’s iGaming Sector Is Still Strong\nAccording to the most recent iGaming Ontario report, local operators handled CAD 9.5 billion ($7 billion) in wagers in December alone, up 2% month-on-month. For the full year, operators recorded almost CAD 98.3 billion ($72.5 billion) in betting activity, up 26% year-on-year.\nThe total non-adjusted gross gaming revenue for the period was CAD 425.4 million ($313.7 million), up 5% YOY. The annual NAGGR, meanwhile, exceeded CAD 4 billion ($3 billion).\nFurther data shows that there were almost 1.3 million active player accounts in December, although this figure doesn’t necessarily accurately reflect the player count due to the fact that some have accounts on multiple platforms. The number of active accounts suggests a 2% decline in activity month-on-month. On average, Ontario’s gaming operators earned CAD 334 ($256.3) per player account, up 7% month-on-month and setting a new record.\nCasino Gaming Remained on Top\niGaming Ontario also provided a breakdown of the various verticals, saying that online casino players wagered CAD 8.27 billion ($6.1 billion) in December, making this the most popular vertical by a large margin. As a result, the online casino sector recorded NAGGR of CAD 320.5 million ($236.4 million) for the period, up 8% month-on-month.\nThe sports betting sector, on the other hand, experienced a temporary decline, with handle decreasing by 13% month-on-month to CAD 1 billion ($737.5 million) and NAGGR decreasing by 3% to CAD 99.1 million ($73.1 million).\nFinally, the P2P Poker sector experienced a 9% increase in wagers to CAD 141 million ($104 million) in December. However, the vertical’s NAGGR declined by 7% to CAD 5.8 million ($4.3 million).\nIn the meantime, the growth of the Ontario iGaming market has encouraged more companies to tap into what it has to offer. As a result, DAZN Bet just secured entry into the Canadian province, hoping to capitalize on the local opportunities.",
