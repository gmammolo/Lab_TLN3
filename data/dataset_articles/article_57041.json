  "text": "Shilpa Shetty Kundra Whether it’s a glamorous red-carpet appearance, a television show, or a casual day out, Shilpa Shetty Kundra manages to make the six-yard drape look modern, versatile and completely her own. But behind that ease lies years of inspiration she took from her mother. “I think it’s a garment that really allows you to be you,” Shilpa says, speaking about her long-standing love for sarees. “I am so fortunate that I'm born Indian, that you know, it's our national garment. And when I travel abroad, if I really want to make a statement and set a trend, I can actually wear a stunning georgette saree with a little bit of shimmer and shine on it for a night out. Trust me, I know people will end up asking me, ‘where did you get it?’” Shilpa Shetty’s Vibrant Ghagra-Choli Is A Social Media Sensation For Shilpa, the saree is far from restrictive—it’s a canvas for self-expression. “You can toy with so many colours and fabrics and prints and make it Indo-Western and style it differently. There are so many ways to drape a saree. It’s my favourite garment,” she adds. Her comfort with the saree, she admits, didn’t come overnight. “I learnt from the best—my mum, who looks fantastic in a saree. She taught me. Honestly, I used to be quite scared to wear a saree back in the day. Till I started working in the movies at 17, and every time I had to wear a saree, I’d be like, ‘yeh pleats nahi ho raha meri se!’ So that time the hairdresser would help me. But today, I can literally wear a saree in less than five minutes,” she laughs. That comfort and admiration were born from years of watching her mother dress up for work. \"I remember loving the drape when my mom used to go to work. She used to not only wear sarees, she used to match her bindi to the saree—like back in the day with the liquid bindi. If there was a mango design on the saree, she’d do a mango design with dots on her forehead! I even remember her hand-painting a saree with one of her friends. Those memories will never leave me.” It’s this nostalgia that often finds its way into her work too. In her upcoming film KD: The Devil, Shilpa’s look is a tribute to her mother’s style from the 1970s. “It’s a full-on retro look. It’s an ode to my mum. I literally copied what she used to wear back in the day—those mega sleeves, the knotted blouse, and simple georgette sarees,” she says. That same personal touch reflects in her latest collaboration with AZA Fashions, where she has launched ROAR, a collection of bold animal-print sarees.\nEnd of Article Follow Us On Social Media Tired of too many ads? go ad free now Trending Stories In Section Entire Website Tired of too many ads? go ad free now",
