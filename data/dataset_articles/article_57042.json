  "text": "I've wanted to talk about this game for awhile and now seems like the perfect time with the player appreciation sale on Steam. I brought up Osfront briefly in older threads but now I want to shed some more light on it. I bought it earlier this year and it's one of the few RTS games I resonate with. I'm very picky with RTS these days and I usually look for the ones that do something cool or unique. I'm actively trying to get better at the game because I think its a lot of fun.\nMade by a small indie dev called Barbedwire Studios, who I believe are based out somewhere in Spain; CTA Gates of Hell: Osfront is a standalone expansion of another game simply called Call to Arms. The difference is that the latter is modern warfare themed while the former is based on World War II. With Osfront, they've been knocking it out of the park with updates and support.\nThat said, I want to go over what the game has to offer because there's a lot of content and replay value here.\n[Game Modes]\nSingle Player\n- Campaign - Story related content.\n- Conquest (Dynamic Campaign) - Pick a faction and build out your own army over a customizable and procedurally generated campaign.\n- Skirmish (Contains multiple game modes inside and these can be played either Offline and Online)\n- Battle Zones - Capture and hold key positions on the map!\n- Domination - Inflict as many losses to the enemy as possible. Protect your field HQ at all costs. Capture designated points to seize the initiative!\n- Last Stand - Defend your HQ against waves of enemies. Hold out until time has expired. Secure key locations for additional resources!\n- Cooperative - Battle through the Single Player Campaign with others!\n- Frontlines - One army attacks the defended position of the other team. Fight for territory and incur as many losses as possible to the foe!\n- Online Game - Manipulate game settings and play modded games.\n[Overview]\nThe base game features one Allied faction and one Axis faction, the USSR (Russia) and Nazi Germany. The DLC called Talvisota adds Finland as a playable Axis faction, and the DLC called Liberation adds the USA faction for the Allies. These DLC's usually add something extra for other factions as well like extra skirmish missions and maps.\nNow, the Single Player campaign is pretty self explanatory; This is basically story mode for your selected faction. The other mode called Conquest is probably the most popular one because of how much replay value it has and it allows players to play how they want. Let's take a look at it with the USA faction:\nConquest is a very customizable game mode. You can select your faction, set the difficulty, change the length, the economy, etc.\nInside, players navigate through a Research Tree, unlocking units they want to recruit. When starting out, I take some infantry like the Veteran Rifle Squad, a small jeep to wheel around my ammo supply box, maybe a Stuart tank, some engineers to build fortifications or lay down mines, medics for healing and reviving downs, and a Sniper to help with surveying the area ahead. Sometimes I like to challenge myself by playing as infantry only to see how far I can go.\nAfter the army is set up, you'll be given options to either go on the Offensive, or Defensive. Each one rewards useful resources to help grow your army further and hopefully reach the enemies HQ.\nWhile Gates of Hell: Ostfront is an RTS, it has simulation and sandbox elements too. During Conquest, it's important to repair and comandeer any disabled vehicles from the enemy. These can used against them in the next mission or sold for more resources!\nThere's other things you can do like commanding an infantry unit to search inside vehicles for things like fuel, repair kits, weapons, or search dead bodies for ammo and grenades, and even trade amongst your troops. Medics start out with a pistol and it's a good idea to give them a better weapon to improve their survivability. You can also take off mounted machine guns from vehicles and use them yourself!\nWhen playing Skirmish mode, you don't get the massive selection of units found in Conquest. Instead, you get something called Doctrines. These are basically an assortment of units that the name implies. For example, when playing as USA, you can choose from an All-Rounder, Defensive, Irregular, or Offensive Doctrine. The Germans have a bunch more Doctrines to choose from if you have the DLCs.\nThings can be taken further by choosing a War Stage; From Early-War, Mid-War, and Late-War. If you choose Early or Mid, then you'll have access to earlier era tanks and units but I think most people just stick to Late War.\n[Direct Control]\nHere's something really cool and what makes Gates of Hell: Osfront resonate with me. If you don't trust your units to attack or defend an area, you can take control by clicking on them and pressing hotkey E to enable Direct Control mode! This allows you to move the unit with WASD keys. They can Crouch (Alt) and go Prone (Ctrl) too! From there, are two perspectives to cycle between by pressing hotkey T; A top down isometric view or a third person view. Scrolling up or down on the mouse wheel helps zoom in or out.\nUnits like snipers and tanks have a first person view in addition to the other viewpoints. Any unit on the field with the exception of planes can be Direct Controlled.\nTop down, isometric view:\nThird person view:\nSo yeah, that's CTA Gates of Hell: Ostfront! It's really fun to play around in and my favorite game mode besides Conquest is Last Stand. I've played it on and off since April trying to get better at keeping my infantry alive. Does anyone else play this game?\nBarbedwire Studios is getting ready to release their next expansion called Finest Hour in the next month or so which adds the British Commonwealth faction. They just released a trailer for it yesterday and I'm super hyped. Supposedly this is going to be the biggest DLC since Liberation.\nLast edited:",
