  "text": "By David Caraccio ,\n15 hours ago Once-in-a-generation, modernist S.F. gem stuns with stellar style, light, space Sweeping around a corner on Edgehill Way in San Francisco, a mid-century modern estate with a storied past has come to market for $10 million, presenting an opportunity to own a residence built by one of the city’s most influential post-war developers.\nIn a gesture as grand as his citywide ambitions, Angelo Sangiacomo commissioned 111 Edgehill Way in the late 1960s for his own family—and surrounded it with nine other custom residences for relatives, according to Compass real estate firm. From his beginnings as the son of an Italian contractor and carpenter in the Richmond District, Sangiacomo became one of the largest landlords in San Francisco’s history. He founded Trinity Properties, a family-owned company.\nSteeped in cherished memories and tradition for Sangiacomo’s children, the home stands not just as a stunning landmark but as a tangible reflection of a family legacy that helped sculpt the city.\n“My siblings and I felt so fortunate growing up in this home,” seller Sandro Sangiacomo, one of Angelo and Yvonne Sangiacomo’s seven children, said in a statement. “My parents shaped with heart and uncompromising intention the home I grew up in. I remember long dinners in the kitchen and all the fun we had downstairs. Sharing this place now isn’t an ending; it’s a continuation of what they believed in: bringing people together. I hope the next family feels what we felt here and adds their story to the history.”\nRare level of artistry The property delivers to market a rare level of artistry, according to Compass. Listing agent Neal Ward of Compass underscored the property’s singular place in San Francisco’s architectural history.\n“Over the course of my career, I’ve had the fortunate opportunity to represent families of architecturally significant homes,” Ward said in an email to The Sacramento Bee. “This residence stands among the highest expressions of intentional thought, architecture, and design level rarely seen. It’s not only about its architectural pedigree; it embodies the ultimate balance of entertaining, family living, and enduring comfort. The opportunity to become its next chapter offers not just a home, but a lasting legacy for the next family to carry forward with joy.”\nSpread across five levels 10,000 square feet, the home offers eight bedrooms and eight bathrooms. Five bedrooms have Jack-and-Jill bathrooms. Panoramic ocean and city views highlight the dramatic primary suite.\nThe home is defined by bold visionary architecture and thoughtful use of materials, boasting open volumes, floating mezzanines, floor-to-ceiling windows and artisan touches throughout. The great room has a breathtaking 20-foot ceiling and a ribbon of windows tracing the site’s curve along the corner of the Edgehill Way.\nThe expansive chef’s kitchen features top-tier Viking appliances, dual refrigerators, a large pantry and an ocean-view breakfast space, blending formal and informal living.\nThe home is defined by bold visionary architecture and thoughtful use of materials, boasting open volumes, floating mezzanines, floor-to-ceiling windows and artisan touches throughout. Brian Kitts Entertainer’s haven The lower level contains a 2,000-square-foot entertainer’s haven: an open-concept lounge with a full wet bar, kitchenette, space for lounge seating or games, home theater and two guest suites.\nOutdoors, south-facing terraces bring in vistas of the Golden Gate Bridge and the hillside greenery.\nSangiacomo assembled a virtual dream team of design talent to create the home. Robert V. Arrigoni, co-founder of BAR Architects, led the ambitious project; Howard Backen contributed his vision in the early stages; and noted professor Dale E. Benedict provided later refinements, according to Compass.\nCompleted in 1970, the result is an “architectural tour-de-force,” according to the marketing materials.\nWith San Francisco’s famously limited parking, it should be noted the property has a side-by-side four-car garage. Other notable elements include five wood-burning fireplaces and an elevator.\nSandro Sangiacomo said his father built and owned property only in San Francisco.\n“If he could not get to his property in a car in less than an hour, he was not interested in it,” he said.\nThe Sangiacomo hilltop house also holds views of the Marin Headlands and Farallon Islands.\n“The hill does not feel like you are in San Francisco, there are lots of trees and places to play,” Sandro said. “There was a great rope swing there when we were growing up.”\nThe great room has a breathtaking 20-foot ceiling and a ribbon of windows tracing the site’s curve along the corner of the Edgehill Way in San Francisco.
