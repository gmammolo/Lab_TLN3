  "text": "Launched at the inaugural TOURISE Summit, the ‘New Codes of Luxury: Elevating the Hospitality Guest Experience with AI’ white paper, produced by The Future Laboratory in partnership with Together Group, reveals how AI will redefine service, personalisation, and the very meaning of luxury for a new generation of global travellers.\nAs the luxury hospitality sector faces unprecedented competition and rapidly evolving guest mindsets, the white paper offers actionable strategies for both legacy and new brands on how to harness AI in ways that elevate and not replace the human touch at the heart of hospitality.\n“Luxury hospitality is at a pivotal moment. Guests expect seamless experiences, authentic recognition, and confidence in every interaction,” His Excellency Ahmed Al-Khateeb, Minister of Tourism and Chairman of TOURISE said.\n“AI is not an optional upgrade; it is a critical part of our sector’s future advantage. This white paper provides a practical roadmap for brands to harness AI in a way that empowers staff, protects privacy, and ensures service remains distinctly human. Those who lead this transformation will define the next era of luxury travel.\nChristopher Sanderson, co-founder of The Future Laboratory, added: “The most powerful experiences today are those that reflect who you are and what you care about. Our research shows that luxury is moving from ownership to engagement, from transaction to relationship. AI, when rooted in brand values and deployed with care, can unlock a new level of anticipatory, emotionally intelligent service and make every guest feel known, valued, and at home, wherever they are in the world.”\nDrawing on exclusive research among high-value hotel guests in the UK and US, and insights from leading industry voices, the research clear shows that human connection is non-negotiable with 63% of respondents saying service should remain ‘human-first’, with AI valued most when it enables staff to spend more time with guests. -TradeArabia News Service\nRelated posts",
