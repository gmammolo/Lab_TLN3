  "text": "Get the best deals and latest updates on theater and shows by signing up for TheaterMania's newsletter today!\nIt’s Christmas Eve and the news of Santa Claus’s sudden death has thrown the North Pole into chaos. Elves and reindeer riot in the streets, the Gingerbread House of Commons crumbles and Mrs. Claus boards a Southbound Polar Express leaving the denizens of the North Pole shell shocked. Amidst this turmoil comes Edelweiss, a holiday-pageant-turned-memorial for old Saint Nick. Join four elves and a reindeer as they come together to sing and dance their way through the five stages of grief; and, perhaps, discover they can save Christmas after all.",
