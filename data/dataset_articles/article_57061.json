(And the pirate ship is currently on sale for sub-£100.)\nWhile there's a toy for everyone on your list from the 15 DreamToys picks, our fave is the toy that will appeal to multiple family members of different ages, interests and genders. Plus, it's interactive.\nHere's why we love the Monster Jam Smash & Bash Grave Digger remote-control monster truck for Christmas this year.\n© Spin Master\nWhat is the Monster Jam Smash & Bash Grave Digger remote control car?\nLicenced toys account for £1 in every £3 spent (36%), and this official Monster Jam remote control car from Spin Master has a 4.6/5 star rating on Amazzon, with customers noting it 'keeps kids entertained', can withstand a 'proper beating' and 'the detailing is spot-on, and it really captures the look of the real Monster Jam truck'.\nWe like that it can be used from age three and up (parents love it, too), indoors and out, and it encourages kids off screens and moving as they chase it around as it flips, spins, tumbles and speeds.\nThe 1:15 remote control monster truck boasts authentic Grave Digger detailing with a rugged body and soft rubber tyres, and has an interactive smash mode, where it looks 'smashed' after crashing into walls. You reset it back to its OG state with the touch of a button.\nThere's a full-function USB-C rechargeable remote control with 20 minutes of uninterrupted play; the controller takes 2 AAA batteries (not included). Customers recommend getting rechargeable batteries as they can drain quickly.\nAs one happy customer explains: 'It resets itself fast after impacts and hasn’t needed any fiddling or manual fixing. The movement is smooth and quick, and the kids haven’t stopped using it since the day it arrived. The wheels grip even on slick floors, and it handles rougher areas outdoors better than I expected.\n'Battery life’s been decent for what it is – enough time for a proper play session before needing a charge. It doesn’t feel cheap or fragile, even when it’s flipped over or thrown around. Some toys get used once and forgotten – this one keeps ending up in the middle of the room, ready for another round'.\nThe toy typically retails for £49.99 but is 30% off, down to £35, on Amazon currently.\nWe think this might just be the perfect family toy. Just don't trip over it...\n© Spin Master\nMonster Jam, Official Smash & Bash Grave Digger Remote Control Indoor & Outdoor Vehicle, now £35 at Amazon (was £49.99)\nWhat else is on the DreamToys must-have Christmas toys list for 2025?\nDreamToys' annual list is always highly anticipated, and with the UK toy market growing by 6% so far this year (according to data tracking experts, Circana), it's expected to be a bumper year for Chistmas toy gifting.\nBetween the cost-of-living crisis and sustainability woes, it's helpful to have the guidance from pros of toys children actually want to play with.\nHere are the 15 toys that made the list – many are currently on offer.\n5 FAQ on DreamToys’ 2025 Christmas toy picks\n1.
