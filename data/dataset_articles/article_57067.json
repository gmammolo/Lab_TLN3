  "text": "Priyanka Chopra recently spent some time interacting with her fans online, where most questions revolved around her upcoming film SSMB29 with SS Rajamouli and Mahesh Babu. Fans were eager to know about her experience working in the Telugu film industry and whether she had tried Hyderabad’s famous biryani yet. Priyanka sounded genuinely excited, saying, “It’s still early days for me on the movie, but it’s been Adiri poyindi! Also, Hyderabad’s biryani is the best in the world.\" Her first look as Mandakini was recently revealed. She was draped in a yellow saree and holding a gun. When a fan asked if she would be donning traditional South Indian attire for the upcoming big event, she kept things mysterious and simply replied, “Shhhh. A lot will be revealed on the 15th,\" with a wink. Priyanka Chopra On Returning To Indian Films A fan told her how much they missed seeing her in Indian movies, and her response felt honest and emotional. She said she hopes this marks “a new era\" and possibly her full return to Indian cinema, but she’s still figuring things out. At the same time, she shared that she’s grateful for the support she gets and wants to do her best work wherever she is in the world. After so many years focused on Hollywood projects, teaming up with Rajamouli for a major Indian film feels like a big step back home. Working alongside Mahesh Babu only adds to the excitement. Fans have been waiting for her comeback, and Priyanka seems just as hopeful as they are. Mandakini’s First Look And The Big Event Rajamouli and the team revealed Priyanka’s character look yesterday, and it immediately made waves. As Mandakini, she’s shown in a simple yellow saree, holding a gun and looking ready for action. The film also stars Mahesh Babu and Prithviraj Sukumaran. To build the buzz, the makers are hosting a huge launch event on November 15 at Ramoji Film City, which will also be streamed online for fans everywhere.",
