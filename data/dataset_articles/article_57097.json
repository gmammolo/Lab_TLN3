  "text": "There’s a new lifesaver patrolling the waters off the Western Cape!\nCape Town, South Africa (13 November 2025) – The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) has officially welcomed Film Industry Rescuer 3, a new rescue vessel funded by South Africa’s film industry.\nThe NSRI accepted their new rescuer into the fleet in a naming and blessing ceremony at Melkbosstrand on Sunday.\nThe bright orange JetRIB (it’s a combination of a jet ski hull and an inflatable rescue craft) is designed for fast rescues that occur close to shore. Its jet propulsion system makes it safer to manoeuvre through waves without the danger of propeller injuries when saving swimmers, surfers, or boaters in tough surf.\nThis isn’t the first time the film industry has stepped up for sea rescue.\nSince 2017, it’s helped fund three NSRI rescue boats. The first two, Film Industry Rescuer One and Rescuer Two, have both been credited with saving lives.\n“We would like to acknowledge the crucial role of the National Sea Rescue Institute,” said Rudi Riek, Chief Executive Officer of Film Industry Visa Assistance NPC. “The NSRI embodies courage, professionalism, and community service. Their lifesaving operations, whether at sea, along our rugged coastlines, or in protecting coastal livelihoods, reflect a national commitment to saving lives.”\nThe vessel was officially christened by Marna Riek, Rudi’s wife, and blessed by Pastor Barend Buys, who offered a prayer of thanks and protection for the Station 18 volunteer crew who’ll be taking Film Industry Rescuer 3 out on calls.\nThis new addition couldn’t have come at a better time for the Station 18 team. Their stretch of coastline, from Milnerton’s Lagoon Beach Hotel to Bokpunt, is one of the busiest in the Western Cape.\n“Melkbosstrand Beach, a seven-kilometre-long Blue Flag beach, is a popular destination for surfers, swimmers, and boaters. The new JetRIB will play a vital role in swift, effective life saving operations in this high-activity area,” says Station Commander Rowan Marais.\nMarais also shared his gratitude to SA’s film industry, which has played a huge role in saving lives, way beyond the screen.\n“Station 18, Melkbosstrand, extends our sincere gratitude to the Film Industry for its ongoing partnership and commitment to community safety. This enduring collaboration reflects how collective effort and shared responsibility save lives, both on set and at sea,” says Marais.\nThe NSRI runs entirely on donations and volunteers, yet manages to safeguard SA’s vast coastline through training, education, and rescue missions. They’re true heroes of our seas.",
