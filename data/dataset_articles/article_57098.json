  "text": "Next Article\nWhy basil deserves a spot in every kitchen and garden\nVinita Jain\nWhat's the story\nBasil is a fragrant herb that has been a part of culinary traditions for centuries. Apart from its aromatic properties, basil is also known for its nutritional benefits. This herb is rich in essential vitamins and minerals, making it a great addition to any diet. From enhancing flavors in dishes to providing health benefits, basil is an indispensable herb in kitchens around the world.\n#1\nNutritional profile of basil\nBasil is loaded with nutrients, including vitamin K, which is essential for bone health and blood clotting. It also provides vitamin A and magnesium. The herb contains antioxidants such as beta-carotene that protect cells from damage. Basil also has anti-inflammatory properties due to its eugenol content, which can help reduce inflammation in the body.\n#2\nCulinary uses of basil\nIncorporating basil into your meals can elevate the taste of many dishes. It is commonly used in salads, soups, sauces, and pesto. Fresh basil leaves are often added at the end of cooking to preserve their flavor and aroma. Dried basil can be used as a seasoning during cooking to infuse dishes with its distinct taste.\n#3\nHealth benefits of basil\nThe health benefits of basil go beyond taste. The herb is known to promote heart health by reducing stress and lowering blood pressure. Basil's antioxidants also promote a healthy immune system by fighting free radicals. Further, some studies indicate that basil may have antimicrobial properties that can help fight infections.\n#4\nTips for growing basil at home\nGrowing basil at home is easy and rewarding. Start by planting seeds or seedlings in well-drained soil with plenty of sunlight. Water regularly, but avoid overwatering as it can lead to root rot. Pruning the leaves encourages bushier growth and prevents flowering, which can alter the flavor of the leaves.",
