  "text": "The introduction of SHE—short for Sanlorenzo Heritage—has captured my imagination (and maybe even my heart!) because it’s fresh, it’s new, and pays homage to the past with all the comfort and tech of today unlike any other yacht I’ve seen recently. According to the Sanlorenzo comms team, “SHE is not the beginning of a range, but a solo expression of yachting heritage reimagined by Sanlorenzo’s talented team of artisans and designers, in close collaboration with the contemporary architectural inspiration of Zuccon International Project and Lissoni & Partners.”\nBut I think Massimo Perotti, President and CEO of Sanlorenzo Group says it even better.\n“SHE is a celebration of Italian yachting artistry,” he says. “SHE represents a journey seven decades in the making. A yacht reflecting everything we believe in: Elegance that doesn’t shout. Innovation that respects. Design that endures. Launching SHE during the 20th anniversary of my custodianship of Sanlorenzo is deeply meaningful. SHE is a bridge between what we’ve inherited and what we choose to become.”\nThat’s a very cool sentiment. And as you can see, SHE’s exterior lines evoke the very cool spirit and grace of the 1960s. “SHE is designed for connoisseurs who appreciate timeless elegance and purity of form,” says Tommaso Vincenzi, CEO of Sanlorenzo. “A tribute to beauty and heritage, where every detail reflects our vision of a contemporary, conscious way of experiencing the sea.”\n“SHE is not just a yacht; it is memory in motion,” says Bernardo Zuccon, of Zuccon International Project. “It is the result of a design journey rooted in the tradition of Italian shipbuilding, defined by craftsmanship, culture, and aesthetic sensitivity, and which, with respect, opens itself to new visions. Every line, every volume of SHE originates from the desire to reinterpret forms and proportions that marked an era, giving them a contemporary language.”\nIn what may be the ultimate combination of classic and modern, the stern opens to reveal a legit beach club/water-level terrace. The main deck is all on one level. The cockpit is spacious and adaptable. And even the deck is clad with a sustainable synthetic reinterpretation of natural teak (that was chosen for its near-zero maintenance and ability to reduce surface temperatures by 3–4°C) without sacrificing the timeless elegance of the teak deck look.\n“SHE is a gentle yacht” adds Piero Lissoni of Lissoni & Partners. “It reuses traditional elements and evokes the grace of the 1960s but leaps forward into 2030. It’s a modern yacht with many innovations, simply expressed through a softened aesthetic language.”\nSHE also marks a new chapter in Sanlorenzo’s journey toward sustainable innovation, becoming the first yacht in the fleet to integrate Volvo Penta’s hybrid IPS propulsion system — a dual-energy solution combining electric and diesel power. Equipped with twin IPS30 units (2x1000 HP), SHE guarantees a cruising speed up to 20 knots in hybrid setting. In full-electric mode, the yacht can navigate silently up to 9 knots.\nCool. Very cool.",
