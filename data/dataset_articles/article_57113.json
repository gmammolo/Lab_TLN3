  "text": "The Golden Bachelor season 2 has come to a glorious end, after a season filled with controversy, stingrays, romance, Fantasy Suits, and never-ending drama. Mel Owens, the 66-year-old former NFL linebacker, has finally made his choice, and it was one for the books! The final episode, which aired on Wednesday, November 12, 2025, ended with the ‘golden bachelor’ standing on a sunlit Antigua beach, donning a blue suit and white Hokas, as he handed his final golden rose to the winner. ADVT.\nADVT.\nTRENDING NOW And the final rose goes to… Drumrolls please… It’s Peg Munson - Is anyone surprised? The 62-year-old retired firefighter and bomb tech from Las Vegas has won over Owens’ heart, and the latter seems ready to start a new chapter. Peg had caught the 66-year-old ex-NFL star’s heart quite early on in the season, and fans have enjoyed their brewing chemistry throughout. As Peg Munson stood in front of Mel Owens in a shimmering gown, she beamed in joy as the latter extended the golden rose to her, claiming, “I've got the perfect gal, right here.” As Mel handed his final golden rose, he also slipped in a sparkling Neil Lane commitment ring on her finger, declaring: \"I trusted you, you trusted me. You told me you had confidence in me that I'd make the right choice. And here you are. I have a ring, and this represents a commitment to love. To give us time together to figure out what our future holds… And one more thing, Peg, will you accept this final rose?\"\nThough the ring wasn’t a proposal, Peg didn’t hesitate for even a second when Mel offered the show’s final rose. In what fans are calling one of the sweetest senior romances in reality TV, the divorced single mom said: ADVT.\n\"Of course I will.”\nadvertisement.\nContinue reading below\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE Hema Malini Shares Update On Dharmendra's Health After Discharge, 'Sab Upar Wale Ke Haath Mein Hai' Published: Nov 13, 2025 | 12:01:16 IST 'Chicago Med' Fall Finale: Is 'Dr Caitlin' Going To Be 'Ok' After Blood-Pumping Domestic Violence?

Published: Nov 13, 2025 | 10:28:57 IST Although the ring wasn’t a marriage proposal, by accepting it, Peg sealed the blossoming love story, one that began with dune buggies, a cosy Fantasy Suit, and an undeniable spark that lit both their eyes whenever they were together in the show. Cindy Cullers walked away first? As expected, after such a dramatic season, the finale episode also kicked off with a cliffhanger. Beginning with a continuation of Mel’s Fantasy Suites dinner with Cindy Cullers, 60, the drama intensified when the retired biomedical engineer from Austin arrived ready with questions specifically about Mel’s hesitance to propose. ADVT.\nCindy was direct with her questions and demanded the same from Mel. When the divorced father of two told her he indeed wasn’t ready to jump into an engagement, Cindy did something no one could have expected: she walked away! However, she made sure that it was one of this season’s most unforgettable exit lines. Before their Fantasy Suit even began, she walked away after telling Owens: \"I want my guy to feel like he's been struck by lightning and can't live without me. I'm sorry, it's not what I want. Are you OK if I leave now?\"\nADVT.\nAfter her shocking exit, Cindy looked devastated as she tearfully told the camera that it \"hurts really bad.” However, she has no regret about her decision. During the After the Final Rose segment, Cindy’s words were received with roaring applause: \"I don't think I need to convince a man to love me. His analogy was 'finish the game.' I was in the wrong stadium.\"\nAre Mel Owens and Peg Munson still together? Well, while a wedding doesn’t seem to be in their cards yet, Mel Owens and Peg Munson are still very much together. After walking into After the Final Rose arm-in-arm, the couple revealed that they had been quietly dating since the show’s filming wrapped. They also teased their travel plans to Vegas, Michigan, the Super Bowl, and a romantic Napa getaway, courtesy of the show. Though Cindy’s early exit might make Peg a default winner of The Golden Bachelor season 2, her chemistry with Mel was just too strong to ignore. And the Bachelor Nation definitely agrees, Peg was always the one! Read Next: 'The Golden Bachelor' Finale, Mel Owens Hid His Ex-Wife, Fabiana's 19-Year Age Gap With Him?",
