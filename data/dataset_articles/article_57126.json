  "text": "Celebrating Malaysia on the table\nMalaysia is a precious land of bold flavors, colorful aromatics, breathtaking sights and kindhearted people.\nGrowing up, some of the best memories that I had with my late dad, Ting Dayrit, weren’t just about the places we visited but having that sumptuous food we shared there. On every trip—the misty mountain, the beaches and the crowded industrial towns—each experience left a colorful and flavorful mark on my taste buds.\nAs soon as I remember our journeys to the highlands, either Genting or Cameron, cool air comes to my mind and, what is more important, the various kinds of food that we love to eat in each place. My excitement during the visit to Genting always revolved around the very Malaysian Food Street. It was such a feast for senses—the delicious smell of the noodles freshly grilled and the spices beautifully mixed caught all the air. That was the place where we got to know the most famous hawker stalls throughout the country; we just had to choose what to eat, and then our hearts would be filled with happiness, all done at one place. There are two dishes that I absolutely could not resist—a plate of smoky heat Penang Fried Kway Teow and the tender, ginger-packed and flavorful Hainanese Chicken Rice. One could easily discover the right comfort food to wrap oneself against the cold.\nThose gourmet memories came flooding back when I attended the launch of the Malaysian Food Spread at Circles. The Malaysian Ambassador, H.E. Dato’ Abdul Malik Melvin Castelino, said that this special event is a joint project of the Malaysian Embassy in Manila and Shangri-La Manila, running until Nov. 16.\nThe Ambassador also expressed his thanks to chef Edwin from Shangri-La Makati and chef Ammar for introducing real Malaysian flavors to Manila.\nThe program partnered with Makati Shangri-La, Manila, and it is a good meeting of gastronomy and hospitality. The hotel, which is in the central business district of Makati, has been the preferred venue for international gatherings, diplomatic events and cultural shows.\n“This culinary showcase is not just about delicious dishes,” he said. “It’s about celebrating who we are as Malaysians—a nation built on diversity, harmony, and shared traditions. Food, for us, is more than something we eat; it connects us across families, communities, and generations. Every dish you taste tonight tells a story—a story of migration, trade, culture and friendship. These are the stories that have shaped Malaysia’s identity.”\nHe added, “Through this program, we hope to share with our Filipino friends and the international community a little piece of Malaysia—our flavors, our warmth, and our spirit of unity in diversity.”\nHe added, “It is also our way of strengthening the cultural ties and friendship between Malaysia and the Philippines—two nations that share so much in common, especially our love for food and hospitality.”\nWe sampled a wonderful menu featuring some of Malaysia’s most beloved dishes—Rojak Pasembur, Nasi Minyak, Kerapu Asam Pedas, Mee Kari, and Ais Kacang—each prepared with passion and authenticity. Each reminded me of all those trips back in Malaysia. The Rojak Pasembur is a delightful mix of vegetable fritters in a spicy-sweet peanut sauce, offering that perfect balance of crunch and flavor. Nasi Minyak features fragrant ghee rice perfumed with spices, reminiscent of festive occasions that bring families together. Kerapu Asam Pedas, a whole grouper bathed in fiery tamarind-chili broth, was bold, dramatic and unforgettable. Mee Kari’s noodles soaked luxuriously in coconut curry with a hint of sambal, and Ais Kacang—Malaysia’s iconic shaved ice dessert—provided a refreshing, colorful finish to the feast.\nThe coastal delicacies that were served to us reminded me of my dad and the seafood dishes we shared. The first thing that came to my mind was Ikan Bakar which is fish grilled in banana leaves that helps produces that unique charred smell and the fiery-spicy explosion of Asam Laksa, the fish noodle soup that revitalizes all senses.\nOf course, a must-have before the end of the Malaysian trip: Nasi Lemak, the classic main dish. Served with delicious coconut rice, crunchy peanuts and anchovies, a boiled egg, and the various flavors of sambal mixed together felt like home with every bite.\nNo matter the rank of Malaysian food, whether it’s from lowly street food stall or upscale resort, it is always accompanied by the pleasant memory of the beautiful places we’ve visited. Moreover, the memory attached to it is always full of joy that was shared around the table. Every time this cuisine conjured a savory souvenir: flavors that made me feel at home again and again. From Kuala Lumpur to Cameron Highlands, and here in Manila, the “Taste of Malaysia” still lingers at Circles, Shangri-La Makati.",
