  "text": "By Madison Clark ,\n2 days ago 7 Vintage Finds You Should Always Pick Up at Thrift Stores for Unique Style and Great Deals I’ve always enjoyed exploring thrift stores because you never quite know what treasures you might uncover. These shops are full of unique vintage items that carry a bit of history and character, making them special finds compared to new, mass-produced products. Over time, I’ve learned there are certain types of vintage pieces that are worth keeping an eye out for.\nKnowing which vintage finds are consistently valuable can save you time and help you make smart choices that add real charm and potential worth to your collection. Thrift stores offer a great way to discover such items without breaking the bank, and I’m excited to share some of the ones I think are definitely worth picking up.\nPhoto by Artem Krapivin Vintage Pyrex Mixing Bowls I always keep an eye out for vintage Pyrex mixing bowls when I visit thrift stores. Their colorful patterns and sturdy glass make them both useful and collectible.\nSome designs can be worth quite a bit, especially if the colors are vibrant and the bowls are in good condition.\nWhat helps me identify authentic vintage Pyrex is checking the backstamp on the bottom. It’s a small detail, but it can really make a difference.\nI love finding these bowls because they add a nostalgic touch to any kitchen and sometimes even surprise me with unexpected value .\nSmith-Corona Typewriters I’ve always loved finding vintage Smith-Corona typewriters at thrift stores. These typewriters were popular starting in the 1920s and have a sturdy, classic design that still works well today.\nMany models are portable and perfect for collectors or anyone who enjoys the satisfying click of manual typing.\nI appreciate how easy it is to spot a Smith-Corona, thanks to its distinct look and reliable build. Plus, vintage models often come fully refurbished, so they’re ready to use right away.\nIf you enjoy retro items with history, picking up a Smith-Corona typewriter is a great choice when you spot one.\nOrnate Picture Frames I always keep an eye out for ornate picture frames when I visit thrift stores. These frames often have detailed craftsmanship that you don’t see in modern pieces.\nEven when empty, they can add character and charm to any room. I like to display them on their own or use them to show off photos or artwork.\nThey’re usually affordable and easy to find if you’re willing to do a little digging. I find they bring a unique vintage touch to my home decor.\nCollectible Cowboy Boots I always keep an eye out for vintage cowboy boots when I’m thrifting. Boots from well-known brands like Tony Lama or Lucchese often have great quality and unique designs.\nOne tip I follow is to check for pegged soles. They usually mean the boots were well made and can last longer. Plus, finding a pair with good leather and minimal wear makes the hunt even more rewarding.\nI’ve found some great styles, from hand-tooled shafts to embroidered patterns. These boots bring a bit of Western charm to any wardrobe.\nVintage Denim Jackets I always keep an eye out for vintage denim jackets when thrifting. They have a unique charm that you just don’t find in new jackets. Worn-in fades, interesting washes, and sometimes even patches give each piece its own personality.\nBrands like Levi's, Lee, and Wrangler are especially worth hunting for. The quality tends to be better, and the styles can range from classic to cool retro vibes. Plus, buying vintage denim is a great way to shop sustainably.\nRetro Board Game Pieces I always keep an eye out for vintage board game pieces when I thrift. These small items can be real gems for craft projects or replacing missing parts in old games.\nPieces like metal tokens, dice, and colorful pawns often have a unique charm you won’t find in modern sets.\nBefore buying, I check that the pieces are in good condition and match the original game if I’m hunting for specific replacements. They’re small treasures that can add a nostalgic touch to collections or crafts.\nMid-Century Modern Furniture I always keep an eye out for mid-century modern pieces when I go thrifting. These items have such clean lines and timeless designs that fit well in almost any space.\nFinding a vintage walnut credenza or an Eames-style chair feels like uncovering a little treasure. They add character without overwhelming a room.\nIt can take some patience to find the right piece, but scoring a quality mid-century modern item at a thrift store is really rewarding. Plus, it often avoids the high prices of antique shops.\n7",
