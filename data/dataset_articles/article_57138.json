  "text": "Once defined by its airport and Expo 2020 legacy, Dubai South is rapidly becoming one of Dubai’s most attractive residential destinations for end-users and investors.\nIndustry data highlights the transformation. In the first five months of 2025, property deals in Dubai South surpassed AED15 billion, according to a report from ZāZEN Properties.\nFurther growth is expected as the Dubai Metro Blue Line extension and the expansion of Al Maktoum International Airport unlock new connectivity and demand.\nAffordable pricing, robust rental yields, and large-scale infrastructure projects are shifting the area from a long-term vision into a present-day reality for families and professionals seeking connected, value-driven living, said a report.\nBeyond infrastructure, Dubai South is building out a fully integrated lifestyle ecosystem. The community’s visionary master plan is designed to host over one million residents, with parks, landscaped spaces, schools, hypermarkets, and shopping centres providing everyday convenience. The location offers seamless access to major highways, including Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road (E311), ensuring easy connectivity to Dubai’s key districts.\nDubai South is also home to the Business Hub Free Zone, where journeys begin; growth accelerates, and success stories are written. Designed to help entrepreneurs, small businesses, and international firms set up quickly and scale with confidence, the hub merges digital convenience with personalised support within a sustainable urban ecosystem, strengthening Dubai South’s role as both a lifestyle and business destination.\nMadhav Dhar, COO and Co-founder of ZāZEN Properties, commented: “Dubai South represents the next chapter of Dubai’s real estate evolution. Today’s buyers want more than a property; they want communities that are liveable, affordable, and future-ready. At ZāZEN Properties, we pride ourselves in setting the premium living standard in each area we enter, by continuously developing residences that combine high quality, modern design, value, and community-driven living.”\nLooking ahead, the affordable luxury segment in the UAE is primed for continued growth. Projections indicate that the market will maintain an annual growth rate of 2.28% from 2025 to 2029, reaching an estimated value of AED2.79 trillion by the end of the decade. This growth will be fueled by a combination of strong economic policies, investor-friendly regulations, and a strategic focus on urban development. - TradeArabia News Service\nRelated posts",
