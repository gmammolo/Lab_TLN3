  "text": "Jennifer Aniston is in love, and it’s clearly evident. The star is raving about her new boyfriend, Jim Curtis, with whom she recently went Instagram official. The Friends star spoke about Jim for the first time during an interview. Talking about him, she said, “Hypnotism is one of the many things he does. He’s quite extraordinary and helps many, many people.”\nJennifer Aniston on Jim Curtis\nShe further added, “He’s very special, very normal, and very kind, and wants to help people heal and move through their trauma and stagnation into clarity. It’s a beautiful thing to commit your life to.”\nThe star hard-launched her relationship with Jim earlier this month on Instagram, sharing a sweet black and white photo of herself hugging him from behind.\nIn the caption she wrote, “Happy birthday, my love. Cherished” with a red heart emoji.\nJennifer Aniston and Jim Curtis relationship\nJennifer and Jim sparked relationship rumours back in July, when they were spotted boarding a yacht in Mallorca, Spain, with some of the other friends.\nJennifer Aniston on starting a family one day\nLast month, Jennifer addressed how she feels about starting a family one day. During an appearance on the Armchair Expert podcast, Aniston said she had decided against adoption after trying IVF for years and experiencing fertility issues.\n“When people say, ‘But you can adopt,’ I don’t want to adopt. I want my own DNA in a little person. That’s the only way: selfish or not, whatever that is, I’ve wanted it,” she explained.\nThe actor said that having children “just wasn’t in the plan, whatever the plan was”, and recalled the heartbreaking moment when doctors told her she had done all she could.\n“It’s very emotional, especially in the moment when they say, ‘That’s it’ – because there is a weird moment when that happens,” she said.\nTo stay updated with the latest Hollywood news, follow us on Instagram and X, like us on Facebook and visit masala.com.",
