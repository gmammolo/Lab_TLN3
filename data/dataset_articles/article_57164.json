Then she elaborates by telling her mother what would happen if someone did kiss her, and let's just say she means business.\nBorn during the pandemic, this little firecracker is an only child and fiercely protective of her mother.\nUsually, it's the other way around, but these pandemic babies are a whole species of their own.\nWatch a video on TikTok where she displays her protective nature over her mother.\nThe video takes us back to the 2020-2021 social media trend, in which parents pretended their neighbours wanted to fight them just to see their children's reactions.\nOf course, the internet was flooded with videos showing toddlers standing up for their parents.\nWhat did Mzansi have to say?\n- \"Raising parents is hard.\"\n- \"She's strict.\"\n- \"Did she stutter?\"\n- \"That “no” was personal, like did you not hear what I just said.\"\n- \"She was my bodyguard in 2009 I trust her with my life.\"\n- \"This is the strictest child I've ever seen.\"\n- \"I love how intelligent she is, although it's funny no one can take a chance with her. Well done, mommy.\"\nMom, Chandre Tammy-Lee also shared how her feisty daughter is in charge of her outfit changes, and sometimes she embraces her energy and accepts it all.\nLike most parents will tell you, it's always better to accept than argue.\nCheck out the video showing what outfit she put together for herself, courtesy of TikTok.\n[@chandretammylee]5 outfit changes everyday but today it’s was 5 in 1 😭😭😭[#pandamicbabies][#grwm][#kidsoutfit][#fyp][#explore][♬ original sound - Chandre Tammy-Lee]\nHOW TO LISTEN TO EAST COAST RADIO\n- Listen to East Coast Radio on the FM (\nfrequency modulation) spectrum between 94 and 95 FM on your radio. byor(/).- Listen to\nEast Coast Radio on the DStv audio bouquet, channel 836. - Switch to the audio bouquet on your Openview decoder and browse to channel 606\n- Listen to us on\nAmazon Alexa.\nFollow us on social media:\nImage Courtesy of iStock\nCheck out more from East Coast Radio\nShow's Stories\n-\nMom shares a video of her feisty 'pandemic baby'If you're a parent to a pandemic baby, you will completely resonate with...\nCarol Ofori 3 minutes ago -\nKZN shore fishing explodes despite strong windsKZN shore fishing delivers nonstop action despite strong winds.
