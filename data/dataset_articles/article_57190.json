  "text": "Abbey gets £425,000 towards restoration project\nA historic abbey has welcomed £435,000 through grants and loans to support its ongoing £5m heritage project.\nThe Delapre Abbey Preservation Trust in Northampton has received the money through help from the Architectural Heritage Fund, as it looks to transform old stables into a multi-purpose space for wellbeing, retail and events.\nRichard Clinton, the trust's chief executive, said without the \"significant\" funding it \"would have faced increased costs and delays in realising the vital benefits this project will bring to the community\".\nIt has also received £3m from the Lottery Heritage Fund - and with local students also aiding the restoration, it is hoped work will be finished by April.\nThe Architectural Heritage Fund's chief executive, Matthew Mckeague, added: \"The restoration and reuse of the underused stable block on Delapré Abbey Estate will not only... ensure the long-term preservation of this historically important site, but it will also deliver significant social impacts.\"\nIt was able to help the project by offering a loan from its Heritage Impact Fund, and help it access more money through two other funds - some of which has gone towards the installation of solar panels.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
