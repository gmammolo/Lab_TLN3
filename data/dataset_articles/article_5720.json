  "text": "Today (Jan. 22), I want to thank first responders, law enforcement, volunteers, and community members throughout Minnesota after the safe recovery of a missing 7-year-old Zimmerman girl early this morning:\nIn a time that has been difficult for so many Minnesotans, yesterday our community showed the very best of who we are—neighbors helping neighbors, and courage in the face of uncertainty. I want to thank the Sherburne County Sheriff’s Office, local and neighboring law enforcement agencies, fire departments, emergency responders, and every volunteer who stepped forward to help bring this child home.\nAs word of the missing child spread, the response from the community was overwhelming. At one point during the search, the Sherburne County Sheriff’s Office reported that “we have more volunteers than we need,” reflecting the outpouring of support from Zimmerman and surrounding communities.\nAfter the child was found, the Zimmerman/Livonia Fire District shared that responders “went door to door and canvassed every feasible area,” noting that they were joined by hundreds of volunteers. “Some walked. Others drove. All showed up,” the department stated.\nOne volunteer summed up the spirit of the effort, saying:\n“We didn’t need to know her. As responders, parents, and neighbors, we refused to stop until she was found.”\nThat statement says everything. This was a coordinated, compassionate response that truly shows the strength of Minnesota’s public safety professionals and the people they serve.\nRep. Novotny expressed his gratitude to all agencies and individuals involved and emphasized the importance of continued cooperation between law enforcement and the public during emergency situations.",
