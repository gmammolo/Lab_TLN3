  "text": "Over 360 of Pasadena’s finest gathered to honor Tim Estes of Fiesta Parade Floats at the 14th Annual Shine Gala, hosted by and benefiting the Pasadena Ronald McDonald House (PRMH) on Saturday, November 3 at the Langham Huntington Hotel in Pasadena. Lead by gala chair Ann Moore, this was a record breaking event raising more than $380,000 to support the organization’s mission, serving as a “home away from home” for families with critically ill children, keeping them close to one another and to the care they need.\n“It was incredible to see our greater Pasadena community turn out — our largest crowd yet, by far – to support our mission of keeping families close during their toughest times,” said Elizabeth Dever, event host and executive director, Pasadena Ronald McDonald House. “We could not do this important work without the help from our donors, hospital partners, volunteers and the generosity from so many supporters in the community.”\nHighlights from the live auction were a 7-day Cruise for two guests on the Royal Princess of Princess Cruises, a 7-night stay in luxurious accommodations on the big island of Hawaii and two adorable Labrador puppies. Their first time attending the event, the Tournament of Roses 2019 Royal Court greeted guests and spoke during the program. The food was prepared by the amazing Langham Huntington Hotel staff and the wine was graciously donated by the Riboli Family of San Antonio Winery. The event was emceed by veteran news anchor, Jeff Michael.\nThe more than $380,000 raised at this year’s Gala will help fund 4,550 room nights. Since first opening its doors in December 2004, PRMH has served more than 21,900 children and their families in their time of need. The 12-room House is built on the simple idea that nothing else should matter when a family is focused on the health of their child – not where they can afford to stay, where they will get their next meal or where they will lay their head at night. The House is a program of Ronald McDonald House Charities of Southern California (RMHCSC). More information is available at www.rmhcsc.org/Pasadena",
