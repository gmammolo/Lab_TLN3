One happy reviewer shared, “Our cats love this thing. It’s tall, and they love stretching up full length to scratch at it. They seem to enjoy both the sisal rope and the cloth/carpeted pieces. We humans love the green color and how cute the faux cactus is. It took about a year to scratch up the first one, so we have bought two more, one for each room the cats spend most of their time in. We get lots of compliments on the cacti. I like that we can hang things from the cactus arms so the kitties can self-play when we are busy.”\nWhile another wrote, “Needed to replace an old scratching post, and this unique one was an eye-catcher and no brainer since we live in a desert area. My cats took to it immediately, making it easy to remove the old favorite, and trusty one they had completely destroyed. They have a lot of posts throughout the house, but this looks like the front runner at the moment. It’s pretty sturdy and well made, so a fairly long life is expected.”\nOn sale for just $16.01, this sturdy, stylish and desert chic cat post may just become your cat’s newest obsession. Whether they are scaling it like a mountain lion or batting at the hanging pom poms for hours, this Frisco Cactus Scratcher turns every day scratching into a feline fiesta.\nGrab yours now on the Chewy website while it is still blooming, because the only thing better than a cat-approved toy is one that doubles as home decor!\nChewy Shoppers Say This Tuna-Flavored Cat Supplement Is a Game Changer for Digestion\nTuna-flavored probiotic cats can’t resist.\nDai Poole\nAbout the author\nAlexandra Jump\nPet News Writer",
