  "text": "5 hours ago The story of Upper Crust Pizza & Pasta began long before the first pizza dough was tossed in Santa Cruz. It began in Carini , a small coastal town outside Palermo, Sicily, where the Carollo family’s love of food was born. In that corner of northern Sicily, life revolved around family gatherings and long meals made from fresh, local ingredients—a culture where food was love, connection, and celebration. Those traditions and recipes made their way across the ocean, eventually finding a home in California.\nPhoto by Upper Crust Pizza & Pasta When Joe and Sharon Carollo opened Upper Crust in 1979 , they weren’t just introducing a restaurant—they were introducing a piece of their heritage. Their thick-crust, Sicilian-style pizzas, handmade sauces, and cozy atmosphere quickly stood out in Santa Cruz. Over the years, it became a local institution, the kind of place that felt just as right for a family dinner as it did for a late-night slice after a UCSC basketball game.\nThe Carollo family didn’t just serve food—they built relationships. For decades, Upper Crust has been woven into the fabric of Santa Cruz life. It’s where birthdays were celebrated, finals were survived, and friendships were forged over shared pies and laughter echoing through the dining room.\nPhoto by Upper Crust Pizza & Pasta Now, that legacy continues under the leadership of the next generation. Nick Carollo , who grew up inside the restaurant’s four walls, officially took over ownership this year. For him, this isn’t just about running a business—it’s about carrying forward a family story nearly five decades in the making.\n“I essentially grew up here,” Nick says. “I learned how to make dough, how to greet guests, and what it means to care about what you serve. My parents built something special, and now I get to keep that alive while bringing in new ideas for the next chapter.”\nThose new ideas include updating parts of the menu, expanding community partnerships, and hosting events that bring people together—all while keeping the heart of Upper Crust exactly as loyal guests remember it. The pizza dough is still made by hand, the sauces still simmer from scratch, and the house-made ranch dressing remains one of the restaurant’s most-requested secrets.\nPhoto by Upper Crust Pizza & Pasta Upper Crust’s menu offers something for everyone— classic thick-crust pizzas , hearty pasta dishes , fresh salads , and comfort favorites like the muffaletta and cannoli that blend authentic Italian recipes with Santa Cruz soul.\nBut perhaps the most symbolic piece of the restaurant’s story is its mural. Once featured in The Lost Boys , the original artwork became a small piece of Santa Cruz history. Recently, Nick teamed up with local artist Taylor Reinhold to reimagine it—depicting the ocean reclaiming the city as a reflection on climate change and resilience.\n“The mural represents both our past and the future,” Nick explains. “It’s a nod to how Santa Cruz has evolved, just like we have. Our restaurant stands as a reminder that tradition and creativity can exist side by side.”\nPhoto by Upper Crust Pizza & Pasta Of course, running a restaurant in Santa Cruz isn’t without its challenges. Rising food and labor costs, the local economy’s seasonal shifts, and the cost of living all play a part. But for Nick, those challenges only reinforce what’s most important.\n“What motivates me is the people,” he says. “Seeing families who’ve been coming here for 30 or 40 years, students finding us for the first time, or regulars who treat this place like home—it’s what keeps me going. Upper Crust has always been more than a restaurant. It’s part of Santa Cruz.”\nPhoto by Upper Crust Pizza & Pasta As Upper Crust approaches its 46th year , it remains one of the city’s most beloved dining spots—a testament to family, community, and the enduring power of a great meal. With its mix of old-school warmth and a fresh generation’s energy, Upper Crust Pizza & Pasta continues to be a place where everyone, from lifelong locals to first-time visitors, feels right at home.\nUpper Crust Pizza & Pasta\n📍 2415 Mission St, Santa Cruz, CA 95060\n🍕 Established: 1979\n👨‍🍳 Owner: Nick Carollo\n🍝 Signature Dishes: Thick-crust pizza, hearty pasta plates, muffaletta sandwich, and house-made cannoli\n🎨 Local Touch: Home to the iconic mural reimagined by artist Taylor Reinhold — first seen in The Lost Boys\n🌊 Spirit: Honoring 45 years of family, flavor, and the heart of Santa Cruz\n1",
