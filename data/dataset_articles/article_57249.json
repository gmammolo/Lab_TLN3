  "text": "Swimming teacher twins, 80, 'feel at home' at pool\nTwin 80-year-old sisters, who are still happily working as swimming teachers, said the poolside was where they felt most \"at home\".\nAlison Hubbard and Jennifer Brackley, from Hertfordshire, have been teaching for more than 30 years combined and have been called \"inspirational\" by colleagues and students.\nThey now work alongside people who they taught to swim many years ago at Royston Leisure Centre.\nThe sisters have urged people to stay active for as long as possible, saying age should not be a barrier to exercise or trying new activities.\nMs Brackley has taught swimming at the leisure centre since it opened more than 20 years ago.\n\"It's lovely to see the children, it's great to see them improve with their lessons and it's really nice for the parents to say, 'Oh how lovely to see you; I'm so glad my children are with you',\" she said.\nMs Hubbard, who chose to follow her sister when she retired from her office job aged 60, said swimming was \"always a hobby which I enjoyed\".\n\"We're now getting children coming through to learn to swim where we've already taught their parents,\" she said.\n\"The parents appreciate the fact that they know us and we have a lot of experience, and some of them are probably surprised that we're still here.\n\"But it's something we both enjoy, and we're not likely to give it up.\"\nDaniel Peddar, general manager of the leisure centre, praised the sisters for their enthusiasm and continued support.\n\"Jenny and Alison are much-loved members of our team. They're a huge part of the Royston community and a shining example of how staying active keeps both the body and mind young,\" he said.\nBoth sisters said they kept fit when not teaching and preferred to go to the gym, which Ms Brackley described as her \"heaven\" and \"place of solace\".\nMs Brackley added: \"I know we're now 80, but if you don't keep moving, and you don't eat well and exercise, your body's not going to work.\n\"Every morning, I do an hour's weight training before I come to work - and if I don't use the gym or have a swim, then I will go for at least an hour's power walking.\"\nMs Hubbard admitted she was less keen to power walk and preferred lifting lighter weights following a back operation.\nBut when asked who was the best swimmer out of the pair, Ms Hubbard responded diplomatically.\n\"Oh dear, I'm better at breaststroke - Jennifer's better at front crawl,\" she said.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
