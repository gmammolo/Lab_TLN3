  "title": "As gold prices soar, lab-grown diamonds shine brighter in wedding season - The Economic Times",
  "text": "While 2025 may be well remembered as a golden year, thanks to the yellow metal’s remarkable bull run, the sentiment is far less upbeat in India’s wedding industry. On October 16, 2025, just days before Diwali, gold prices hit an all-time high of Rs 1,28,395 per 10 grams on the MCX. In fact, gold prices have surged more than 62% so far (as of 12 November) this year. The high gold price is now pushing Indian consumers to explore affordable alternatives, such as lab-grown diamonds (LGDs). Praveen Govindu, Partner at Deloitte India, said although the wedding purchase season in India is still underway, the true impact on lab-grown diamond (LGD) sales will become clearer once it ends. “However, early indicators suggest a strong increase in purchase intent across key buyer segments, such as brides and grooms, wedding attendees, and those planning to gift jewellery. Rising gold prices are a major factor contributing to the growth of LGDs this wedding season,” he said. Gold prices have surged by 30-35% year-on-year, making traditional gold jewellery less accessible for many buyers. Lab-grown diamond players like Limelight, Akiorah, and Lucira are seeing a surge in demand compared to last year during this period. Pooja Sheth Madhavan, Founder & MD, Limelight Lab Grown Diamonds, said the company has witnessed nearly 2.5X growth in demand compared to last year. “Consumers are not only exploring but confidently purchasing larger solitaires and statement bridal pieces in LGDs, given the value proposition and identical quality to mined diamonds. Our bridal collections and gifting categories have seen the strongest traction,” she said. Mumbai-based Lucira, another lab-grown diamond firm, is also seeing strong demand across bridal and gifting segments, driven by engagement rings, tennis bracelets, and its signature collections. “Across our Chembur store and online platform, we’re noticing a steady rise in self-purchase jewellery and pre-wedding gifting. Customers buying lab-grown diamond pieces not just for the wedding day but for the entire celebration journey,” said Rupesh Jain, Co-founder of Lucira. More parents and families are choosing LGDs for bridal sets, engagement jewellery, and wedding gifting, said Namita Kothari, Founder of Akoirah by Augmont. “Buyers today understand that LGDs are chemically and optically identical to mined diamonds, while offering 30-60% better affordability, full traceability, and a lower environmental footprint. This makes them resonate strongly with new-age consumers and is especially attractive for wedding jewellery, where couples want pieces that are affordable and feel both meaningful and future-forward to them,” she said. She added that digital content and influencer-led bridal trends have played a major role in normalising LGDs as legitimate, aspirational luxury choices. Madhavan said that the growth this year is driven by a combination of awareness, aspiration, and affordability. Additionally, the surge in gold prices has made many customers re-evaluate their wedding jewellery choices, turning to lab-grown diamonds for their luxurious appeal at a far better price point.“Overall, LGDs are no longer seen as an alternative but as a preferred choice for fine jewellery, especially during the wedding season,” she said. For Lucira, the strongest demand is coming from millennials above the age of 35—mainly working professionals, entrepreneurs, and married couples with strong purchasing power. Most of their customers come from tier I cities, such as Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, and Pune, where awareness and acceptance of LGDs are higher and design-forward, conscious jewellery choices are on the rise.It is also important to note that GenZ and younger-millennial consumers are first-time diamond buyers, with no legacy attachment to natural diamonds, said Deloitte’s Govindu. “Jewellery is increasingly viewed as a fashion accessory to be worn rather than an investment to be hoarded. This shift is encouraging buyers to build versatile wardrobes with multiple jewellery pieces suited to different outfits and occasions. LGDs offer optimal price points, allowing consumers to own more pieces without compromising on style or quality,” he said. It appears that there’s also a growing change in perception on seeing LGDs as real, responsible, and modern, not just as substitutes.",
