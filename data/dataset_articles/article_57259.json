  "text": "The UAE has launched ‘Walk to Mars’, a nationwide campaign encouraging residents to collectively cover 54 million kilometres, coinciding with the 100-day countdown to the Open Masters Games Abu Dhabi 2026, the region’s largest multi-sport event.\nThe initiative invites participants to walk, run, cycle, or swim a combined distance equal to the journey from Earth to Mars, symbolising the UAE’s 54th year. Under the theme “Every Step Makes a Difference,” it promotes daily movement, well-being, and an active lifestyle across all age groups and fitness levels.\nSheikh Theyab bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Chairman of the Presidential Court for Development and Fallen Heroes’ Affairs and Chairman of the Supreme Organising Committee for the Open Masters Games Abu Dhabi 2026, attended the launch event, which was also graced by senior officials including Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, and Sarah bint Yousef Al Amiri, Minister of Education, along with several partners and prominent figures from diverse sectors.\nPublic figures symbolically took the first steps on stationary treadmills, marking the beginning of the national effort. The goal is to reach the 54-million-kilometre target by the time the Games open from 6 to 15 February 2026, bringing over 25,000 participants from around the world to compete in 33 sports across more than 20 venues in Abu Dhabi. The Games are open to athletes aged 30 and above, with no prior experience required.\nCommunity events and interactive activities will now promote participation and healthy living. Progress can be tracked through the Open Masters Games Abu Dhabi 2026 app.“Walk to Mars embodies the spirit of progress that defines the UAE,” said Sarah Al Amiri. “Just as our passion for science took us to Mars, this national movement unites us in a shared goal, turning every step into an investment in our health and a vibrant future for generations to come.”",
