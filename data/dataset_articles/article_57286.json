  "text": "If you’ve been skipping workouts because of a packed schedule, here’s some good news — you might not need the gym at all. Apollo neurologist Dr Sudhir Kumar shared a smart fitness hack on X that’s perfect for busy people. He calls them “exercise snacks” — short bursts of movement that can keep your heart, brain, and body in great shape without taking hours out of your day.What are exercise snacks?Dr Kumar explained that these mini workouts can be as short as one to five minutes, done several times a day, and still deliver impressive health benefits. No equipment or special setup required — just simple, frequent movement. Even a few minutes of activity can help control blood sugar, boost cardiovascular fitness, and cut down the risk of diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.He added that these short activity breaks also improve focus and mood by increasing blood flow to the brain and enhancing dopamine levels. Over time, they strengthen muscles, improve balance, and help counter the harmful effects of sitting for long hours.Easy exercise snacks to stay healthyDr Kumar shared a few easy “exercise snacks” to add into your day — a brisk three-minute walk after meals, taking the stairs instead of the lift, or doing ten squats or push-ups between meetings. You can also stretch for a minute every hour, jog in place for a couple of minutes, or try sit-to-stand repetitions while working at your desk.His takeaway was simple but powerful: it’s not about finding time to exercise, it’s about using your time differently. A handful of short, consistent movements spread throughout the day can go a long way in keeping you healthy, alert, and active — no gym membership required.Benefits of small bursts of movementIn an earlier post, Dr Sudhir Kumar also highlighted how even the smallest bursts of movement can make a meaningful difference to one’s health. He explained that breaking long sitting hours with short three-minute walks or taking brief walks after meals can significantly improve blood sugar and cholesterol levels. According to him, this simple habit helps lower the risk of heart attack and stroke, keeps metabolism active throughout the day, and enhances focus and energy.Dr Kumar recommended walking for five to ten minutes after each meal and taking short movement breaks every hour. This, he noted, not only builds endurance but also supports better metabolic health. He further added that spreading movement across the day works better for overall well-being than relying on a single long workout session. For those looking to do more, adding a 30-minute morning walk can provide an extra boost.",
