  "text": "Tangalooma Wrecks, Moreton Island. Image credit: Tourism and Events Queensland\nTourism and Events Queensland (TEQ) has reached a major milestone with the launch of its first-ever global partnership with Klook, a pan-regional experiences platform in Asia Pacific. This landmark collaboration will deliver an integrated, multi-market campaign from January to June 2026, targeting six key Asian markets; Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and the Philippines. Designed to inspire travel and convert interest into bookings, the partnership will showcase Queensland’s diverse tourism offerings, boost international visitation and generate tangible benefits for local operators.\nHeart Reef, The Whitsundays.

By sharing compelling destination stories and leveraging rich content across digital platforms, the campaign aims to connect with travellers seeking authentic, meaningful experiences and position Queensland as the ultimate holiday destination. This multi-million-dollar initiative will work to drive bookings and deepen engagement, encouraging visitors to explore Queensland more fully and discover their next great adventure.\nHoward Smith Wharves, Brisbane.

By joining forces with Klook, we’re amplifying Queensland’s presence in key Asian markets while also creating a seamless path for travelers, from inspiration right through to booking.\nWallaman Falls, Girringun National Park, Townsville.

Together, we’re opening the door to deeper discovery, connecting them to Queensland’s rich tapestry of authentic local experiences, and inspiring them to uncover more purposeful adventures along the way.”",
