  "text": "Patrice and I recently took my 85-year-old mom on her first trip to the Grand Canyon. At 85 and in good health, she really needs little in terms of more material possessions, so we have shifted to sharing experiences with her instead.\nOur trek to see the Grand Canyon was a quick trip. We drove from the ranch to mom’s home in Carson City on a Monday afternoon, flew from Reno to Vegas early the next morning, then rented a car to drive the four hours to the Canyon’s south rim.\nOnce there, we stayed at the Grand Lodge, near the Pueblo Indian village of Tusayan. We stayed two nights and stopped at every public area along the canyon’s south rim.\nWe also took her to the IMAX movie that discussed the history of the canyon. Both Patrice and I had visited the area before, so we focused on showing mom the sites that we found most spectacular and interesting.\nWatching and listening to the elk that live in the ponderosa pine and pinion-juniper stands at the edge of the Canyon have always been a favorite experience for me and autumn is, in my opinion, the best time to experience them. Their whistling and bugling is a sound that is hard to forget.\nAlas, we mostly saw cow elk, and one old spike bull. We enjoyed seeing a small family group of deer grazing near a picnic area; but, mostly, we enjoyed the magnificent canyon and mom’s overwhelmed reaction to it all. Mom’s always been a big lover and collector of Native American crafts. Her home is filled with a lifetime of collecting these treasures. Unsurprisingly, some of her favorite places to visit were a trading post and Hopi House inside the park.\nWe weren’t party animals, and were glad to eat simple suppers (and maybe one prickly pear margarita) and be back in our room in time to watch most of the World Series games.\nOn our last day, we traveled back to Vegas and had a quick dinner with longtime family friends, then jetted back to Reno. I carried mom’s bag, and I’m guessing she added almost 20 pounds in books about the canyon. She was away less than three days; but, her big ol white German Shepherd Jasper was sure happy to see her, and mom said she slept like a log back in her own bed.\nShe can’t wait to dig into her books. I’m sure she’ll be an expert on the Grand Canyon in days. One more thing is certain, it was a trip that none of us will ever forget. Some of the good stuff in life, that we should all endeavor to do more of.\nKris Stewart is a rancher in Paradise Valley, Nevada.",
