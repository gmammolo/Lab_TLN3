  "text": "This morning as Spencer Matthews slipped into the dark waters of London’s Canary Wharf, he began one of the most ambitious endurance challenges ever attempted – seven full-distance triathlons on seven continents in just 21 days.\nThe previous world record for such a feat is four years!\nBy the time he takes his final swim in three short weeks, he’ll be trading the still surface of the Thames for the icy waters of Antarctica, where leopard seals have been known to kill. It’s a journey that will test every limit of body, mind and planning.\nAnd it’s one that Matthews – an entrepreneur who has swapped reality TV fame for a life built around purpose, discipline and extreme endurance – is taking on in aid of James’ Place, the men’s suicide-prevention charity.\n“I wanted to complicate it for myself”\nFor Matthews, PROJECT SE7EN is the natural evolution of his Great Desert Challenge, which saw him run 30 marathons in 30 consecutive days across desert terrain last year.\nAnd speaking to TRI247 on the eve of his latest epic adventure, he told us: “I knew as soon as I was finding my stride out there in the desert that I wanted this to be a regular feeling for me. But I wanted to change it up and make it different. I wanted to complicate it for myself.”\nThe inspiration, he says, runs deep – from his brother James, who once completed an Ironman-distance race when it was almost beyond Spencer’s comprehension, to his late brother Michael, whose love of adventure and mountaineering cost him his life on Everest.\n“There’s a sense of competitiveness and adventure that runs in our family,” Spencer says. “When I pair a big mission like this and a huge audacious goal with a phenomenal cause, you get quite a potent mix.”\nBelief, barriers and beginnings\nDespite his growing experience with extreme challenges, Thursday’s London triathlon will in fact be Matthews’ first ever full-distance event.\n“This will be my first one,” he admits. “It feels a strange mix of being almost too prepared, but also unprepared. I only got my wetsuit two days ago – tomorrow will be the first time I’ve ever worn it.”\nThat blend of calm confidence and candid chaos feels central to what drives him. He’s learned, he says, that most limits are mental rather than physical: “People put barriers on themselves. I genuinely believe people can go out and do extraordinary things if they just believe they can.”\nRacing for something bigger\nBeyond the physical feat, PROJECT SE7EN carries a powerful emotional and social message. Matthews is using the challenge to raise funds and awareness for James’ Place, which provides life-saving support for men in suicidal crisis.\n“A person takes their life roughly every single hour,” he says. “The most likely thing to kill a 35-year-old man is themselves. It shouldn’t be that way. It’s not weak to express how you’re feeling – it always feels good to talk about your problems.”\nThe partnership is deeply personal, too. Matthews credits his own transformation – from years of self-destructive habits to fatherhood and purpose – to learning to open up and face challenge head-on.\n“This is about putting distance between my former self and who I want to be,” he reflects. “Ten years ago, if you’d told me in some nightclub that I’d be attempting seven Ironmans on seven continents in 21 days, I’d have thought you were talking nonsense.”\nA world of contrast ahead\nFrom the silent pre-dawn swim through Canary Wharf to the frozen edges of the Southern Ocean, Matthews knows each leg of PROJECT SE7EN will demand something different.\n“The swim tomorrow morning will be a moment of calm,” he says. “There’ll be no noise in the city, just me in the water taking it all in.”\nFast-forward three weeks and he’ll be back in the water – only this time in Antarctica, aware that “leopard seals have killed before.”\n“I was thinking the other day, imagine doing the six and then getting to Antarctica. You’re nearly there… and one of these ghastly things just drags you down,” he laughs, half-nervous, half-thrilled. “But we’ll be careful. I’ve got three kids – I’m not looking to never see them again over a leopard seal.”\nIt’s a striking contrast that captures the scale of the mission: from London’s skyscrapers to Antarctica’s ice fields, seven triathlons in three weeks, powered by purpose and an unshakeable sense of adventure.\n“Hard things are possible”\nAs he stands on the brink of his first full-distance triathlon, Matthews sounds neither fearful nor complacent – just ready.\n“I’m full of purpose and happy to go,” he says simply. “These hard things are possible. Hopefully this journey can inspire people – men especially – to get out there, talk, and do stuff that makes them feel alive.”\nPROJECT SE7EN began in London, UK, on Thursday 13 November, before it heads to Arizona, Cape Town, Perth, Dubai, South America and Antarctica.\nFunds raised will support James’ Place, which offers free, life-saving therapy for men in suicidal crisis.
