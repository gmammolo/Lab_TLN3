  "text": "What brands need to know about joy in the era of uncertainty\nBrands need to think about how they can help consumers find a spark of joy against a challenging economic and social background.\nFeeling a bit less than optimistic about the future lately? You may not be the only one.\nIndeed, the biggest headline of our latest Ipsos Global Trends release was a change in global attitudes: people around the world feel less personally optimistic than they did just a year ago. For example, in the US alone, optimism about one’s self and family dropped a significant 15 percentage points between 2024 and 2025\nWhat’s behind this shift in sentiment? My hypothesis is that it’s due to many factors including economic uncertainty, lingering wars, worry around the impact of AI on careers, and the long-term effect of the pandemic on our mental health.\nNew research on “anhedonia” caught my eye recently, and I believe it could help us unlock what’s really happening in consumers’ minds. It’s a clinical term described in a recent New York Times article as a diminished capacity for enjoyment – and while it can sometimes be a symptom of depression, it can also occur on its own.\nBut this isn’t simply feeling down; it’s a loss of both the motivation to pursue future rewards and the capacity to enjoy life. The concept seemed to resonate with a lot of people I spoke to, who share a similar sense of joy feeling out of reach.\nPerhaps what we’re seeing isn’t just pessimism, but a more profound issue of loss of emotional reward and motivation. This has a big impact on brands if consumer excitement is muted even when personal circumstances (or the potential for consumption) might be fine.\nThe challenge for marketers may be more than convincing consumers to spend, if people aren’t driven to pursue things that would normally bring them joy, we’re also then dealing with a lack of consumer desire.\nWhat might be driving this\nStepping back and taking a look at the longer-term macro forces around us, we can see some themes that help us understand why consumers might be feeling this way.\nSurely the continued geopolitical conflicts and ongoing wars have had a large impact, but there’s something else shifting and beginning to coalesce:\n1. Economic recalibration: The biggest change over the past year has been a rise in economic instability and geopolitical tensions, largely influenced by the Trump administration’s efforts to set the global trade agenda.\nThis is, in turn, linked to growing nationalism, protectionism, and the desire for control in a zero-sum view of global economics and deficits. What happens on the global stage is keenly felt, as these tensions tilt the cost of everyday goods and services, on top of the post-pandemic inflation shock, driving politics and consumer behaviour.\n2. Technology’s double-edged sword: From searching for information to assisting us at work, the integration of AI into our daily lives has gone from niche to mainstream. Yet questions persist about the long-term effect of technology on our social and practical skills, and the security of our data.\nMany worry about whether there are sufficient ethical and practical controls in place to protect society from bad actors leveraging AI, or from models going rogue and slipping from our collective and individual grasp.\n3. Societal reconfiguration: The past year has been one of rolling back diversity and sustainability initiatives, as many organisations and brands seek to protect themselves from public backlash despite calls for more inclusivity and tolerance.\nThe growing mobility and diversity of citizens is sharpening divisions on identity, part of a deepening divide on social issues from immigration to gender. While the US is perhaps the most polarized, we see increasing fragmentation in many nations around these issues.\nHow consumers are responding\nThe decline in faith in the future might be a flag that the brain’s reward system no longer signals that a goal is worth pursuing. This aligns with several themes we’ve been tracking in our trends study:\nThe Rational Nihilist: Our Ipsos Global Trends study identified the trend of Nouveau Nihilism, rooted in the sentiment that it’s simply “better to live for today” because the future is either uncertain or doomed. This is reflected in the finding that 66% of global citizens agree with the statement, “I live for today because the future is uncertain”.\nFor Gen Z in particular, the promise of hard work leading to traditional milestones like buying a house feels out of reach; they have a clear-eyed view of the systemic nature of these challenges.\nThe System Feels Rigged: This mood is amplified by the feeling that the political and economic context is working against them – and if rewards are systemically unavailable, saving and striving may start to feel irrational.\nWe see widespread agreement that the economy is “rigged to advantage the rich and powerful” (71% agree globally). When people feel this lack of personal agency, withdrawing into manageable, immediate indulgences becomes a rational choice.\nLittle Treat, Slippery Slope? Recent Bank of America research found that despite lack of income, 57% of American Gen Z buy themselves a small treat once a week – even though for over half of them, this leads to overspending.\nMany of them are using BNPL to pay for these treats, and potentially getting themselves into debt But it’s not just younger generations who are using these payment options – older consumers in the UK are increasingly using them as well.\nHow brands are responding\nIn the New York Times article, clinical psychologist and cognitive neuroscientist Dr. Michael Treadway suggests that one way to combat disengagement and recapture joy is to utilize behavioural activation therapy: “It’s sometimes referred to jokingly as ‘the Nike therapy’ because the motto is: ‘Just do it.’”\nPoint being, if you start to just schedule yourself to go do hobbies you used to enjoy or things that are important to you, it helps your brain remember how good it feels, which can then help you feel motivated to do them again.\nNike actually seems to be very in tune with the current mood: they refreshed their iconic Just Do It campaign last month to reintroduce it to a new generation, reframing greatness as a choice rather than an outcome. Their commentary about the brand’s evolution speaks about meeting young athletes where they are, and captures the exact same sort of sentiment:\n“The film’s striking message speaks directly to today’s athletes, who are growing up in a world where trying, and failing, can feel daunting; where taking a leap feels harder than ever; and where the temptation to quit is louder than any reason to keep going. Against this backdrop, the film stands as a challenge to the hesitant generation. Greatness isn’t handed out, it’s chosen — and sometimes the most important choice is to simply begin.”\nBeekman 1802 founders wrote a recent piece for Harvard Business Review advocating for creating sharable moments of joy. They created a viral campaign by partnering with Jiffy Lube to deliver branded facials and spa treatments in the lobby instead of uncomfortable chairs and a long wait.\nThey also mentioned Crumbl Cookies as an example of an everyday indulgence that is elevated to an aspirational ritual via new weekly recipes and the anticipation of watching the giant cookies emerge from the oven.\nDove even got in on the game by collaborating with Crumbl to entice social media shoppers with limited edition lines of favourite flavours like Confetti Cake, Lemon Glaze, Strawberry Crumb Cake and Nilla Bean. The line sold out immediately, and more than half of the shoppers were new to Dove products, proving that little indulgences don’t have to be food and beverages – or even with your current customers.\nUtility and efficiency are table stakes; the emotional relief you provide is the true premium, and creating moments of joy can help rekindle your customer relationships and forge new ones.\nIdeas and takeaways for marketers\nUnderstanding what your audiences are going through will help you consider whether you need to think differently about your campaigns and positioning given the current “meh” mood. Depending on your category, you may need to go beyond sympathizing to reframe how we think about aspiration and long-term goals.\n1. Pivot from Aspiration to Alleviation: If you can’t sell an aspirational future, can you pivot to focusing on closer-in rewards in the present? Instead of positioning success using traditional metrics like homeownership or retirement, focus on providing tangible, immediate relief that validates the consumer’s struggle. A product’s value proposition could be about managing stress, or simplifying complex choices.\n2. Be the source of simple, reliable joy: While this won’t work for every category, many brands can consider shifting from selling a complex solution to offering frictionless joy. How can you embrace simplicity and offering immediate, small, and dependable “wins” along the entire customer journey? In a world where desire and action are declining, a brand’s greatest asset may be its ability to provide consistent emotional nourishment.\n3. Affirm autonomy through wellbeing: Since consumers feel a loss of agency, empower them with true self-control. Products centred on wellbeing—where people are actively pursuing self-reliance—can offer a sense of controllable progress. Consider how your brand can help consumers achieve small, tangible goals (e.g. health, sleep, focus), affirming their ability to shape their holistic health.\n4. Engineer “good” indulgence: Brands in all categories—not just luxury—can lean into the hedonistic side of Nouveau Nihilism, but must do so responsibly. The key is to position the indulgence as a justified, short-term mental health benefit rather than a reckless financial choice, balancing the “fun” with the brand’s long-term responsibility.\nJennifer Bender is an associate partner at Ipsos Strategy3.
