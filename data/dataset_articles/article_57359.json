  "text": "If you are hoping to experience Christmas magic in Munich, you won’t have to look hard to find it. For the 25th consecutive year, Munich Airport is transforming into a winter wonderland, complete with a Christmas market and an ice-skating rink.\nFrom 14 November to 28 December 2025, the Christmas and Winter Market at Munich Airport Centre will fill the plaza between Terminals 1 and 2 with lights, music, food, drinks and festive cheer – as well as skating and curling.\nSet beneath a vast glass roof, the nearly two-month pop-up welcomes travellers, locals, airport staff and everyone passing through to step away from the rush and enjoy a quieter side of the season, even if you’re just on a layover.\nSkating, crafts and a Christmas market in an unlikely location Around 40 wooden stalls will serve Bavarian specialities such as roasted almonds, mulled wine and sausages, alongside handmade gifts and crafts.\nAt the heart of it is a 600-square-metre rink for ice skating and curling – an increasingly popular winter sport played with large smooth stones. Skating costs €5, with skate hire available for the same price, while groups can book the curling lanes for €25 per hour.\nOn Wednesday evenings, that rink becomes an ice disco with a DJ and colourful lights.\nFamilies will find plenty to keep young travellers entertained. The market hosts kid-friendly workshops each weekend, from wreath-making to ceramic painting, where you can design your own ornaments and holiday mugs.\nThere are also craft sessions, face painting, magic shows and guided evening light tours, while Santa Claus will stop by on 27 November, 6 December and 19 December.\nNew this year is the Wish Tree initiative, which invites visitors to pick a child’s wish and help fulfil it by donating a gift before 18 December.\nAdmission to the market is free. There is also complimentary one-hour parking and discounted rates for up to three hours, making it an easy winter escape for anyone passing through Bavaria – not just air passengers.\nA gateway to Europe’s Christmas markets The airport’s festivities are more than just a stopover attraction. They also serve as a gateway to some of Europe’s most atmospheric Christmas markets.\nFrom the Bavarian capital, travellers can take a short train west to Esslingen , where a medieval-themed market fills the old town with costumed performers and candlelit stalls, or to Strasbourg , home to one of the continent’s oldest and busiest festive fairs.\nFor those seeking quieter Christmas charm, smaller markets across the continent – from Vilnius to Brasov, Romania – offer a window into winter traditions with smaller crowds.\nIn Munich, though, the holiday spirit begins before you even leave the terminal.\nGo to accessibility shortcuts\nShare\nComments ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT",
