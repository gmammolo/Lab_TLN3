  "text": "Our family 100% believes in memory-making as the best type of gift. Every Christmas and birthday, Robert and I plan some sort of experience to give to our girls and to each other.\nSometimes it’s as small as a science experiment subscription box. Some occasions, we gift theater tickets to a show touring through town. Lately, as we’ve learned budget travel with points hacking (thanks to my friend Jen ), we’ve been giving a family vacation as a gift.\nEvery single experience gift we’ve ever given has resulted in sweet moments we’ll always cherish. And that’s something that can never be put in the donate bin one day.\nIf you want to do a less material approach to gifts this year, I’ve compiled a huge list of the best experience gift ideas for everyone in your family.\nThe best part of all is most of these experiences can be planned last minute. If you’re in a time crunch, making date plans or booking an experience for the future is the perfect solution.\nWhat to do before gifting an experience Think about the recipient’s interests and lifestyle Set your budget expectations Find ways to use your DIY skills to create an experience Get creative with presentation To package an experience gift like tickets to a play or vacation plans, I usually wrap a pretend fake show ticket , fake attraction ticket , or fake airplane ticket from Etsy inside of a box. (I add a few random things to weigh it down to throw off suspicions.)\nThis Christmas, because we have surprise plans to visit a particular city next year, I’m wrapping two miniature versions of the city’s iconic landmarks in multiple nested boxes. The girls will never guess.\nTurn on your JavaScript to view content Subscription Gifts Even though some of these are technically “material items”, since most are consumable, they become more of an experience than an object you keep.\nStoryworth – memory keepsake\nHeadspace – mental health & wellness\nKiwiCo Crate – science & art projects for kids\nWine Access – variety curated wine delivery\nHello Fresh – meal kit delivery\nShaker and Spoon Box – gourmet cocktail making\nAudible – audio books\nUniversal Yums – international snacks\nTrade Coffee – roasted to order coffee\nWildgrain – bread, pasta, and pastry delivery\nBarkBox – dog toys and treats\nStitch Fix – personalized clothing\nIpsy – makeup and beauty products\nUrban Stems – floral arrangement delivery\nThe Sill – houseplant delivery\nEscape the Crate – escape room mystery box\nMurray’s Cheese – cheeses from around the world\nCraft Beer Club – variety beer delivery\nGoldbelly – variety of food subscriptions\nPlatterful – monthly charcuterie\nCandier – candles\nBook of the Month – book club\nScentBird – perfumes and colognes\nDermstore – skincare\nLovevery – baby & toddler play kits\n“The gift that keeps on giving the wh le year, Clark.” Especially for young kids, an annual pass to a local museum, zoo, or aquarium will definitely pay for itself in the long run.\nYearly Pass Gifts National Parks Service Pass\nLocal Zoo\nLocal Aquarium\nLocal Amusement Park\nTrampoline Park\nMuseum\nPool & Waterpark\nYoga Studio\nTheater Season’s Pass\nBotanical Gardens\nGolf Course\nTurn on your JavaScript to view content If your love language is Acts of Service, gifting professional services is definitely a great idea.\nProfessional Services Gifts Glamsquad – hair and beauty styling membership\nPoplin – personal laundry service\nSoothePass – massages\nFood Fire + Knives – private chef services\nNeat Method – professional home organizing\nNext Level Wardrobe – personal styling services\nThe Expert – interior design consultations\nCare.com – home cleaning\nInternational Detailing Association – car detailing\nTaskRabbit – handyman services\nTurn on your JavaScript to view content Gifting knowledge is one of the best experiences you could ever give!
