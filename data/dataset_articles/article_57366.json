  "text": "Image Credit: Danny Lum By Simon Batt Published 5 hours ago Simon is a Computer Science BSc graduate who has been writing about technology since 2014, and using Windows machines since 3.1. After working for an indie game studio and acting as the family's go-to technician for all computer issues, he found his passion for writing and decided to use his skill set to write about all things tech.\nSince beginning his writing career, he has written for many different publications such as WorldStart , Listverse , and MakeTechEasier . However, after finding his home at MakeUseOf in February 2019, he has been working with it and its sister website, XDA, to bring the latest and greatest in Windows, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity topics.

It includes mechanical pinsetter, ball return, camera scoring, animated LEDs and a small display. You'll need a 3D printer, basic hardware, ~400 print hours and about $811 for essential parts. Do rich people install bowling alleys in their homes anymore? I want to say that it was a huge thing during the 80s and 90s, but I don't really hear much about it these days. Regardless, while us mere mortals can't get a lane installed within our houses, we can make do with miniature bowling alleys instead. They may not be as impressive, but at least you don't have to knock down a wall in your home and set up an entire lane.\nFor instance, someone is offering all of the STL files you need to make a 22% scale bowling alley on Kickstarter, which is definitely up there as one of the more useful things you can 3D print . And if that's not impressive enough, you can wire it up so it acts like a legitimate bowling alley, complete with the moving parts that the real-sized versions have.\nThis 3D-printable electronic bowling alley is one of the coolest projects out there As spotted by Hackster.io , this adorable bowling alley is now ready for crowdfunding. The campaign doesn't give you the complete model pre-assembled; instead, you'll get the 3D printing files you'll need to make one at home. However, once you've printed it all out and wired it up, you get quite the impressive product:\nBuild Your Own Fully Automatic Mini Bowling Lane\nEver dreamed of having a bowling lane at home? Now you can — in miniature form, and fully automatic.\nThis is a 22% scale, working bowling lane — complete with a real mechanical pinsetter, ball return, camera-based scoring, and animated LEDs — all designed to fit on your table.\nAll you need is a 3D printer, some basic hardware, and these files.\nThis Kickstarter gives you the digital files only — STL, STEP, and SOLIDWORKS native — so you can print and build your own lane from pop over to the Kickstarter page scratch.\nIf you opt to build everything included, you end up with a bowling alley with a ton of cool features. The full model will automatically return your ball, reset the pins, and can detect when you've scored a strike. It also uses a little LED screen to display everything going on. And, yes, you can add those little beginner bumper things on the sides of the lane that I had to rely on the last time I went bowling. Listen, I'm just not good at bowling, okay? I need those bumpers to stop myself guttering every round. Don't laugh.\nAs you might have guessed, the project does require some additional hardware over the 3D printable files. It's a good idea to check out the bill of materials before you pledge; the maker believes you'll need to set aside ~400 hours to print everything, and $811 for the essential hardware. If you can check those boxes, pop over to the Kickstarter page and pledge for the digital files.\nFollow Followed Like Close Thread Sign in to your XDA account We want to hear from you!
