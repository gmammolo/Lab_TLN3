  "text": "By Rebekah Absalom Maanya Sachdeva ,\n28 minutes ago Meghan Markle's penchant for strapless dresses was evident long before she married into the Royal Family .\nHowever, as a working royal, the Duchess of Sussex adhered to royal etiquette that prohibited such silhouettes, instead favouring modest clothing.\nSince she quit The Firm in 2020 and relocated stateside with her family, however, Meghan, 44, has adopted a more relaxed and contemporary aesthetic - including the décolletage-baring dresses and sleeveless tops she once loved.\nAnd it's no surprise considering these styles show off her best asset: her shoulders.\nStylist Kelly Caira said Meghan is 'blessed with a slender shape and beautiful shoulders and arms' that will certainly attract an admiring glance or two after the Duchess unveiled the first poster for her new festive Netflix special.\nIn the teaser, Meghan can be seen preparing for a Yuletide spread by decorating her table, with the mother-of-two opting for an asymmetric halterneck gown that highlights what Kelly feels is one of her best physical features.\nThe Duchess has previously revealed she uses a mix of boxing, yoga, hiking, and full-body workouts to stay fit.\nHowever, personal trainer Andrew Herring told the Daily Mail that achieving a similar result doesn't necessarily mean spending hours in the gym or filling up your schedule with four kinds of workout classes.\nSince she quit The Firm in 2020 and relocated stateside with her family, however, Meghan, 44, has adopted a more relaxed and contemporary aesthetic - including the décolletage-baring dresses and sleeveless tops she once loved For fans who want to get Meghan's sculpted look, he recommends an easy-to-follow 20-minute strength training routine you can add to your workout schedule.\nThis includes exercises like lateral raises that target the medial deltoids, or the muscles on the side of the shoulders that create 'that lifted, rounded look', as well as shoulder presses and tricep rope extensions.\nAdditionally, managing fat levels is crucial for the toning to be visible, so Andrew recommends following a high-protein diet.\n'Whether you're in a calorie deficit or at calorie maintenance depends on your current weight/body fat percentage and goals, but both approaches can help reveal muscle definition when paired with consistent training,' he said.\nMeghan has previously said that she eats a lot of fish and vegetables, and even recreated chef Clare Smyth's Poached California Halibut recipe on season two of her show, With Love.\nThe founder of West London Personal Training, Alexander Legezynski previously told the Daily Mail that fish 'offers lean protein to support muscle with hardly any fat', making it a great ingredient to incorporate into your diet.\nIf you're looking to get Meghan's look, Alexander suggested, the best way to get started is to check your BMI - body mass index - to see whether or not you're in the 'healthy' range.\n'Not everyone has to take the same steps. Some people will need to eat less, others the same, and some will need to eat more.'\nStylist Kelly Caira said Meghan is 'blessed with a slender shape and beautiful shoulders and arms' that will certainly attract an admiring glance or two after the Duchess unveiled the first poster for her new festive Netflix special However, personal trainer Andrew Herring told the Daily Mail that achieving a similar result doesn't necessarily mean spending hours in the gym or filling up your schedule with four kinds of workout classes If you pair this healthier, high-protein diet with fitness instructor Andrew's fuss-free gym workout routine two to three times a week, your shoulders will thank you.\nHe added: 'Focus on progressive overload (gradually increasing the weight used or repetitions over time).\n'That’s where real muscle tone and shape develop. The aim is to challenge the muscles while maintaining good form.'\nAndrew also said that there's a simple trick that can really supercharge the results you're looking for.\n'One trick most people overlook is slowing down each rep, especially on the way down.\n'Controlling the movement keeps the muscle under tension for longer, which is what really helps sculpt and define the shoulders.\n'Most people lift too fast. Slowing things down can completely change how the exercise feels and the results you get,' he explained.\nHere's everything you need to get started:\nHow to get Meghan's shoulders\nEquipment needed:\nThe workout:",
