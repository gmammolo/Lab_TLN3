  "text": "By Rudy Coggins ,\n9 hours ago\nDon’t miss your chance to experience five powerhouse performances in one unforgettable night of music.\nIncredible, talented musicians will rock the rafters during the Battle of the Bands at the Duplin County Events Center.\nThe upcoming event is Dec. 13. Doors open at 4 p.m. and the show starts at 5 p.m.\nGeneral admission tickets are $25 and can be obtained online through the Duplin County Events Center. Regular parking is free. VIP parking is $50. Concessions are available.\nCarrie Shields, deputy county manager, appeared before the Duplin County Board of Commissioners on Monday evening to request approval for special concession pricing.\n“Due to a current surplus of concession inventory at the events center and considering this is a county-sponsored event not involving an external promotion company, it is believed to be appropriate to adjust pricing which would help reduce excess inventory while providing added value to attendees,” Shields said.\nThe board approved Shields’ request.\nThe band lineup includes award-winning Rivermist, Southern Touch, Heart & Soul, Dalton Davis and Heart Breaker.\nOne of the East Coast’s well-known bands, Rivermist has earned recognition from numerous music outlets. The band has been voted “Best Local Band of Fayetteville/Fort Bragg” for 10 consecutive years by Up & Coming Weekly’s voters.\nIn 2021, they received the CCMA Best Vocal Group and the CMBA Rising Star Award in 2023. Their song “Oceans Apart” garnered Song of the Year accolades by both 94.9 The Surf Radio and Surfside Radio.\nThe band’s Charlie Sattenfield was nominated for Songwriter of the Year in 2025 for “Oceans Apart.”",
