  "text": "It’s true when they say, “It’s never too late to begin.” Joan MacDonald, 79, is a living example of this. She is a fitness enthusiast who inspires people on the internet with her transformation that began when she joined the gym at 70. In her new Instagram post, she shared the little and big secrets that helped her achieve this transformation. She revealed that losing weight was never as difficult as maintaining it, but she has managed to do so for almost 8 years. Joan, who lives in Ontario, Canada, and is also a grandmother, shared, “When I learned to count macros, eat protein with every meal, focus on vegetables and fibres, train with purpose to build muscle, and get my cardiovascular health up to speed, I finally learned how my body was meant to be.” If you notice, many experts recommend doing the same, especially as you age. But that is not all. Joan also emphasised the importance of building mental strength and social connections to keep at it, adding, “Mindset work, community, and recovery are the added layers that continue to keep me going strong.” Also read: Bengaluru-based fitness coach shares 25 tips that will help you get in best shape Take a look at this post: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Joan MacDonald (@trainwithjoan) In her post, she also credited her social media community. “A big source of my everyday joy is being here with all of YOU. It truly keeps me going knowing that I’m inspiring someone to get their own parents back in shape, or themselves.” She ended her note with a word of encouragement. “I hope my message shows you that anyone can do this for themselves. The quality of your life depends on it. And we are all going to live longer these days, barring an accident or an illness. Make sure your health allows you to enjoy those extra years.” In her interview with Women’s Health Magazine in December 2024, Joan revealed that her journey wasn’t an easy one, but she took her workouts seriously. For her, consistency was the key. Once she took charge of her weight and size, there was no looking back. She also began tracking her macros and consuming balanced meals. Now, she does everything from deadlifts to single-leg unilateral exercises, inspiring her followers on Instagram. Also read: Sleeping for less than 6 hours every night?
