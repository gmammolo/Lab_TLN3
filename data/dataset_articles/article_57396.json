  "text": "1 big thing: Buffett’s guide to a fulfilling life Warren Buffett on a panel at Georgetown in March 2007. Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Warren Buffett, the 95-year-old CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, released a Thanksgiving letter this week, as Greg Abel is set to take over the reins at the company.\nWhy it matters: “Buffett has earned a reputation not only as a legendary investor, but as someone with the secrets to living a better life,” CNBC’s Ryan Ermey writes . 👀 The final paragraphs of the letter contain several nuggets of wisdom, gleaned from 9+ decades of life experience, including these:\n“I’m happy to say I feel better about the second half of my life than the first. My advice: Don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes — learn at least a little from them and move on. It is never too late to improve.” “Get the right heroes and copy them.” “Remember Alfred Nobel, later of Nobel Prize fame, who reportedly read his own obituary that was mistakenly printed when his brother died and a newspaper got mixed up. He was horrified at what he read and realized he should change his behavior. Don’t count on a newsroom mix-up: Decide what you would like your obituary to say and live the life to deserve it.” “Kindness is costless but also priceless … Greatness does not come about through accumulating great amounts of money, great amounts of publicity or great power in government. When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world.”\nRead the full letter .",
