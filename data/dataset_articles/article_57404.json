  "text": "There's a $4.99 Wooden Garland Hiding at Aldi That Will Instantly Add Rustic Charm to Your Holiday Decor\nPine will always be classic, but this sculptural wooden alternative brings effortless elegance – and a much-needed pause from all the greenery\nJulia Demer\nNews\nIt’s not that I don’t love a classic pine garland – I do. There’s probably no better way to line a staircase or lend a festive touch to a barren sideboard or mantel. But we’ve already got the Christmas tree, and that’s a lot of pine needles.\nWhat the season needs now is something still rustic, still within that charming Christmas decor wheelhouse, but with a little more range – a brief break from the evergreen.\nLately, I’ve been into ALDI’s Wooden Beaded Garland for exactly that reason. Made by Merry Moments, it nods to the Christmas tree (wood, obviously) but transforms the material into something sculptural, almost jewelry-like. Somehow, at just $4.99, it keeps the treescape elevated but unfussy (how I prefer any holiday gathering) and adds a touch of boho-ish restraint to all the glitter and gloss.\nAnd the tree is just the beginning. Wooden beads look just as chic swagged across a Christmas mantel, serpentine-style down a holiday table, or – my personal favorite – draped over a doorway to frame a little mistletoe. ALDI’s version runs twelve feet long, so there’s plenty of room to improvise.\nThey’re also ideal for layering. Christmas decor can skew a little evergreen-heavy, but pairing pine with wood lends some much-needed texture and depth. For fellow magpies, it’s the perfect counterbalance to metallics and glass. And if you’ve got a spare pedestal bowl lying around, fill it with the beads for an easy vignette that feels artful in a laissez-faire, ‘I just threw this together’ kind of way.\nEvery brand seems to have a take right now – some in warm, natural tones, others strung with pops of color (a micro-Christmas decor trend in its own right) – but either way, it’s hard to beat the tactile, timeless charm of carved wood this time of year.\nShop Wooden Beaded Garland\nWooden beads bring a cool, collected touch to the holidays – not just for trees, but for wherever you feel like adding a little texture. I’ve rounded up my favorites to drape, swag, or scatter anywhere that could use a quieter kind of sparkle.\nDesign expertise in your inbox – from inspiring decorating ideas and beautiful celebrity homes to practical gardening advice and shopping round-ups.\nReading like an ultra-long strand of winter berries, Holiday Time’s nine-foot red garland delivers rich, saturated color. Don’t let the price tag fool you: it’s earned a perfect five-out-of-five stars for its versatility across mantels, shelves, and Christmas table centerpieces alike.\nSchoolhouse’s wooden beaded garland is so good, it belongs in a jewelry box. Each bead is smooth, substantial, and slightly oversized, giving this laid-back trend a whisper of drama. Reviewers are obsessed, with some ordering multiples (six, to be exact) just to drape across a full nine-foot fir.\nWhy pick between natural textures? This Walmart version pairs wood beads with a jute cord for earthy elegance – this humble garland trend at its most ornate. It’s enough to make an entryway feel festive, but subtle enough to carry a Christmas living room on its own.\nWooden garland isn't the only trend ALDI's bringing back this season. See why the retailer's clip-on Christmas bow ornaments might make for a perfect pairing.\nJulia Demer is a New York–based Style Editor at Homes & Gardens with a sharp eye for where fashion meets interiors.
