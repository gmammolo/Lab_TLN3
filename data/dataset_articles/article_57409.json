  "text": "In Seattle, where coffee flows like water and rain is practically a personality trait, there exists a breakfast sanctuary that transforms ordinary mornings into extraordinary culinary adventures.\nGlo’s, a beloved Capitol Hill institution, has been quietly perfecting the art of brunch while the city around it constantly reinvents itself.\nThe new incarnation of Glo’s on East Union Street maintains the soul of the original while wrapping it in a fresh, modern package that feels both timeless and contemporary.\nStep inside and you’re immediately enveloped by an atmosphere that strikes the perfect balance between stylish and comfortable – like your coolest friend’s apartment if that friend happened to be an exceptional breakfast chef.\nThe hexagonal floor tiles create a subtle geometric pattern underfoot, while the turquoise banquettes provide pops of color against warm wooden wall panels that add texture and warmth to the space.\nGlobe pendant lights cast a flattering glow over marble-topped tables, creating little islands of intimacy in the open dining room.\nIt’s the kind of thoughtful design that registers subconsciously – you might not immediately notice the details, but you feel their cumulative effect in the overall sense of welcome and comfort that permeates the space.\nBut let’s be honest – the décor, lovely as it is, serves merely as the supporting cast to the true star of the show: the food.\nAnd what magnificent food it is.\nThe menu at Glo’s reads like a greatest hits album of breakfast classics, each one executed with the kind of precision and care that transforms familiar dishes into revelatory experiences.\nAt the heart of this breakfast symphony is their legendary Eggs Benedict – a dish so perfectly realized it might forever ruin you for all other Benedicts.\nThe foundation is a properly toasted English muffin – crisp enough to provide structural integrity but not so crunchy that it shatters upon contact with your fork.\nThis crucial carbohydrate platform supports a layer of grilled tomato and ham, topped with poached eggs that achieve that magical state where the whites are fully set but the yolks remain luxuriously liquid.\nThe entire construction is then blanketed with hollandaise sauce that deserves its own sonnet – silky, buttery, with just enough lemon brightness to cut through the richness and prevent palate fatigue.\nEach component is excellent on its own, but together they create something transcendent – a harmonious composition where every element plays its part perfectly.\nThe first bite is a moment of pure culinary bliss – the sauce yielding to your fork, the yolk breaking to create a secondary sauce, all the flavors melding together in a way that makes you momentarily forget your surroundings.\nFor those who prefer variations on the Benedict theme, Glo’s offers several outstanding alternatives.\nThe Eggs California substitutes smashed avocado for the ham, creating a vegetarian option that sacrifices nothing in terms of satisfaction or flavor complexity.\nThe creamy avocado provides a subtle backdrop that allows the hollandaise to shine while adding its own buttery richness to the equation.\nThe Eggs Florentine introduces sautéed spinach to the mix, adding an earthy dimension and slight mineral note that pairs beautifully with the eggs and sauce.\nIt’s the kind of dish that makes you feel virtuous for consuming a green vegetable while simultaneously indulging in one of breakfast’s most decadent creations – a win-win if ever there was one.\nFor seafood enthusiasts, the Salmon (Lox) Benedict replaces ham with delicate slices of lox, creating a sophisticated flavor profile that feels both indulgent and refined.\nThe subtle smokiness and oceanic salinity of the salmon cuts through the richness of the hollandaise, creating a perfect balance that keeps each bite interesting from first to last.\nEach Benedict variation comes accompanied by a side of hash browns that deserve special recognition.\nThese aren’t the afterthought potatoes that many restaurants serve – pale, under-seasoned rectangles that function merely as plate filler.\nGlo’s hash browns are golden-brown wonders with crackling exteriors giving way to tender interiors, seasoned just enough to enhance their natural potato flavor without overwhelming it.\nThey’re the ideal supporting player – substantial enough to stand on their own merits but considerate enough not to upstage the Benedict’s star performance.\nFor those whose breakfast preferences lean away from the Benedict family, Glo’s offers an impressive array of alternatives that receive the same careful attention to detail.\nTheir scrambles elevate the humble scrambled egg to art form status, with combinations that showcase both creativity and restraint.\nThe Glo’s Original Scramble combines four eggs with green onions, garlic, tomatoes, and cheddar, topped with sour cream and smashed avocado.\nEach ingredient maintains its distinct identity while contributing to a harmonious whole – the sharp bite of green onion playing against the creamy avocado, the acidic tomato brightening the rich eggs.\nThe Salmon (Lox) Scramble introduces lox to the equation, creating a dish that feels special occasion-worthy while remaining fundamentally comforting.\nThe Nicholas scramble brings sausage and green onions together with your choice of cheddar or jack cheese, topped with sour cream and salsa for a Southwestern-inspired flavor profile that wakes up your taste buds without overwhelming them.\nThe omelet selection offers equally thoughtful combinations for those who prefer their eggs folded rather than scrambled.\nThe Vegetarian Omelet packs an impressive array of vegetables – zucchini, mushroom, bell pepper, green onion, garlic, and spinach – into a perfectly cooked egg envelope, topped with jack cheese for a meat-free option that satisfies completely.\nThe Black Bean Omelet deserves particular praise for its creative combination of eggs, bell pepper, onion, garlic, vegetarian black bean chili, and cheddar, finished with sour cream and salsa.\nIt’s a cross-cultural breakfast creation that draws inspiration from Mexican flavors while remaining firmly rooted in American diner tradition.\nRelated: The Best Donuts in Washington are Hiding Inside this Unsuspecting Bakeshop\nRelated: This Unassuming Restaurant in Washington has Mouth-Watering Ribs Known throughout the Northwest\nRelated: The Fascinatingly Weird Restaurant in Washington that’s Impossible Not to Love\nThe Spanish Omelet brings sausage, green onion, garlic, and cheddar together, topped with sour cream, smashed avocado, and salsa for a hearty option that could easily fuel you through until dinner.\nFor those with simpler tastes or smaller appetites, the egg breakfast options provide straightforward satisfaction.\nChoose one or two eggs prepared to your specifications, accompanied by hash browns and toast, with optional additions of breakfast meats like bacon, ham, or sausage links.\nThese plates may lack the drama of the Benedict or the complexity of the specialty scrambles, but they showcase Glo’s fundamental strength – the ability to cook basic breakfast items perfectly, every time.\nThe toast options deserve more attention than toast typically receives in culinary conversations.\nBeyond the standard white, wheat, and rye, you’ll find English muffins, sourdough, and cinnamon swirl bread that elevates the humble toast from mere egg-mopping tool to worthy component of your breakfast experience.\nFor a small additional charge, you can substitute a house-made biscuit or bagel – an upgrade worth considering, particularly if you appreciate the textural contrast a good biscuit provides against softer egg dishes.\nNo Seattle breakfast experience would be complete without coffee, and Glo’s serves a brew that stands up proudly in a city obsessed with coffee quality.\nIt’s rich and robust without veering into bitterness, served in generous mugs that encourage lingering conversations and thoughtful savoring of your meal.\nThe refills come frequently but unobtrusively – you’ll never find yourself staring forlornly at an empty cup wondering if your server has forgotten your existence.\nThe service at Glo’s hits that sweet spot between attentive and relaxed.\nThe staff operates with the quiet efficiency of people who understand that hungry customers need prompt attention, but they never make you feel rushed through your meal.\nThey’re knowledgeable about the menu, happy to make recommendations, and seem genuinely pleased when you express delight at your first bite of perfectly poached egg.\nIt’s the kind of service that enhances your experience without calling attention to itself – professional but never pretentious.\nWeekend mornings still draw crowds, a testament to Glo’s enduring popularity in a city where new restaurants open and close with dizzying frequency.\nThe wait is more manageable now with the larger space, but arriving early remains a solid strategy if you’re particularly hungry or operating on a tight schedule.\nThe crowd reflects Seattle’s diverse population – tech workers fueling up before heading to their campus offices, outdoor enthusiasts preparing for mountain adventures, families introducing children to the joy of breakfast beyond cereal, and solo diners enjoying the simple pleasure of excellent food and a good book.\nWhat makes Glo’s special in a city filled with excellent breakfast options is their consistency.\nThat Benedict you fell in love with years ago tastes exactly the same today – the hollandaise still has that perfect balance of butter and lemon, the eggs are still poached to that ideal point where the whites are set but the yolks remain gloriously runny, and the English muffin still provides that essential textural foundation.\nIn a culinary landscape often driven by novelty and trend-chasing, there’s something deeply satisfying about a place that understands when perfection has been achieved and sees no need to reinvent it.\nThis isn’t to suggest that Glo’s is stuck in the past – their new, more modern space proves they’re willing to evolve.\nBut they understand the difference between evolution and revolution, and they know their strengths lie in executing breakfast classics with unwavering excellence rather than pursuing the next Instagram-worthy food trend.\nThe move to their new location represents a new chapter for Glo’s, but the story remains fundamentally the same – exceptional breakfast served with care in an environment that makes you feel at home.\nThe space may be larger and more contemporary, but the soul of the place – that ineffable quality that transforms a restaurant from a business into a beloved institution – remains intact.\nFor Seattle residents, Glo’s is more than just a breakfast spot – it’s a constant in a rapidly changing urban landscape.\nIn a city where entire neighborhoods can transform in the span of a few years, there’s profound comfort in knowing that some experiences remain reliably excellent.\nFor visitors, a breakfast at Glo’s offers a taste of authentic Seattle – not the postcard version with Space Needles and flying fish, but the lived experience of joining locals in a cherished morning ritual.\nThe beauty of Glo’s lies in its unpretentious excellence.\nThere’s no molecular gastronomy here, no deconstructed breakfast concepts or avocado toast adorned with edible flowers and microgreens.\nJust honest, skillfully prepared breakfast classics made with quality ingredients and served in portions generous enough to satisfy even the heartiest appetite.\nIn an era where many restaurants seem designed primarily as backdrops for social media posts, Glo’s remains refreshingly focused on the food itself.\nYes, your Benedict will look beautiful when it arrives – the hollandaise glossy and golden, the plate thoughtfully arranged – but it’s designed for eating, not photographing.\nWhat keeps people coming back to Glo’s isn’t trendiness or novelty – it’s the simple pleasure of a breakfast done right.\nIt’s knowing that your eggs will be cooked exactly as requested, your coffee will be hot and plentiful, and your meal will leave you satisfied in that particular way that only a really good breakfast can.\nFor more information about their hours, special events, or to check out their full menu, visit Glo’s website or Facebook page.\nUse this map to find your way to this breakfast paradise – your taste buds will thank you for making the journey.\nWhere: 928 East Denny Way, 928 E Barbara Bailey Way, Seattle, WA 98122\nIn a city famous for its rain, Glo’s provides the culinary equivalent of a perfect sunny morning – warm, bright, and guaranteed to improve your outlook on the day ahead.",
