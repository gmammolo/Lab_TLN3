  "text": "The upcoming 'Globetrotter' event, which is directed by SS Rajamouli and was earlier titled 'SSMB29', is going to be a record-breaking celebration of Indian cinema. An insider in the business called the big reveal a 'cultural moment' and said that more than 50,000 fans from all over the country were expected to show up. On November 15, the event will take place at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. It will reportedly have India's biggest stage and screen setup, which will be 100 feet tall and 130 feet wide, which is going to be a true visual feast. Talking to fans and netizens over a video, SS Rajamouli spoke of the instructions and how careful one has to be to follow the guidelines given by the organisers. In the tweet, he wrote, “Very excited to see you all at the #Globetrotter event on November 15. The RFC main gate will be closed on the event day. Follow the instructions on your entry pass. Cooperate with police and security to ensure a hassle-free, safe, and happy experience for everyone.” Very excited to see you all at the #Globetrotter event on November 15. The RFC main gate will be closed on the event day. Follow the instructions on your entry pass. Cooperate with police and security to ensure a hassle-free, safe, and happy experience for everyone. pic.twitter.com/bG3Hw5XmD8 — rajamouli ss (@ssrajamouli) November 13, 2025 Rajamouli said, “I am super excited about this event and I am sure all of you are as excited as I am. This is not an open event and only the people who have physical passes are allowed. Do not go by what people are saying on social media. We all need to co-operate with the police and the Government to make sure the event goes well and nothing goes wrong.” Priyanka Chopra's Big Return Priyanka Chopra will also be back in Indian movies after almost six years in &quot;SSMB29,&quot; where she stars with Mahesh Babu in a role that mixes genres. The actress recently shared her first look as Mandakini, wearing a yellow saree and holding a gun. The picture quickly went viral on social media. The production company shared a short video of Priyanka inviting fans to the Globetrotter event. &quot;She's been everywhere, and now she's here to tell you why you can't miss this event.&quot; There is a lot of talk about what the movie's official title will be, but many people think it could be &quot;Varanasi.&quot; What to Look Forward to at the Event The Globetrotter event on November 15 will show character introductions, motion posters, and the first teaser for the movie. This will give fans a taste of Rajamouli's next epic world. Early reports say that the movie will be about a jungle adventure around the world full of action, mystery, and mythology. This is a big change from the director's previous work on Baahubali and RRR. The creators also recently released the first look at Prithviraj Sukumaran as Kumbha, which was shown on his birthday. Some fans have said that the poster is &quot;underwhelming&quot; compared to Rajamouli's usual grand visual style, though. As the excitement grows, all eyes are now on the Globetrotter mega launch. Rajamouli, Mahesh Babu, Priyanka Chopra, and Prithviraj Sukumaran are all expected to be on stage together for what will be the biggest event in Indian cinema this year. He further added, “If you scan the QR code on the pass, clear instructions are given on how to enter the venue and what all has to be done. Kindly follow the same so that we can make the event successful.”\",",
