  "text": "Every year, Childrens Day is celebrated on November 14 in India, and as it around the corner, the attention is on kids, it reminds us to celebrate the little joys that make childhood special, from play and laughter to the comfort of favourite foods. Every parent knows that when it comes to mealtime, kids look for taste first. Parents, on the other hand, want something more, food that feels good and is packed with nutrition, fibre, and protein. But between school runs, work calls, and the daily rush, convenience often becomes the deciding factor. That is where easy and smart recipes come in. The kind that keeps kids excited to eat and helps parents serve something wholesome without spending hours in the kitchen. It is a win for both sides of the dining table, and even better if you are not indulging in food at city restaurants. Good nutrition is not just about eating right; it is about building habits early. Kids need a mix of protein, fibre, and wholesome ingredients to stay active and healthy. These recipes bring together that balance of taste and nutrition in easy, everyday ways.
