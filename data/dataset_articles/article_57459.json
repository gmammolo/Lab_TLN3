  "text": "By Abby Montanez ,\n9 hours ago The old gasworks at the edge of the U.K.’s Doubly Thankful Village of Upper Slaughter had been abandoned for decades, its stone walls softened by moss and time. Built in 1877 to light the nearby Brassey Estate, it had long since gone dark—until novelist Jeanette Winterson saw something worth rekindling.\nThis New 1,100 HP Station Wagon Is a Menace for the Road\nBest known for her groundbreaking debut, Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit —published when she was just 24—the novel earned the 1985 Whitbread Prize for Best First Novel and, five years later, a BAFTA Award when Winterson adapted it for television. The author, who has long explored transformation in her writing, seemed drawn to the same idea in physical form when she purchased the derelict gasworks in 2011 with plans to create a quiet writing retreat.\nRELATED: This Century-Old Arts and Crafts Home in the U.K. Could Be Yours for $7 Million\nThe gasworks building now features a cozy sitting room with an antique carved stone fireplace. Ben Nicholson She secured permission to convert the 19th-century acetylene plant and brought on architect Chris Dyson , known for his thoughtful approach to introducing modern design into heritage structures. Together, they envisioned a bold reinvention, preserving the weathered Cotswold stone façade of the existing building and adding a dynamic CorTen steel and glass extension.\nDespite all the planning, Winterson sold the property before the work was complete. Her vision nonetheless endured, with a later owner carrying out Dyson’s design, adding a circular steel tower inspired by the site’s old underground gas pit. The finished home, known simply as the Gasworks, won praise and accolades for its daring balance of industry and intimacy, including the Sunday Times Home Award and shortlistings for the RIBA, WAN, and Blueprint awards.\nInside an $8 Million Home in Upstate New York With Direct Access to a 4-Mile Racetrack\nRELATED: A Restored 19th-Century Gothic Manor in the Cotswolds Lists for $8 Million\nThe dining room doubles as a library in the original cottage. Ben Nicholson Now available through Savills for £1.85 million (about $2.5 million ), the home delivers over 3,000 square feet of unique living space. The original cottage contains a modern kitchen with bespoke cabinetry, a cozy sitting room with a wood-burning fireplace, a dining room, and a double bedroom with a private bath. A glass corridor connects to the modern wing, which houses three additional en suite bedrooms for family and guests, a principal suite with sweeping countryside views, and a writing room with a log burner. The tower is capped by a skylight.\n“A fabulous marriage of industrial and domestic set in an idyllic landscape,” says Savills agent Lay McCluskey. Beyond the walls, the Cotswolds unfold in soft greens and golds—horses grazing in the pastures, deer in the distance. For all its architectural pedigree, The Gasworks remains quietly personal—a house first imagined by a writer who believed that even the most forgotten places can be reimagined into something luminous.\nClick here to see more photos of this Cotswolds home.\nBuffalo Trace Just Released the Strongest Version of Its Classic Sazerac Rye Whiskey\nBen Nicholson 1",
