  "text": "By Erik Shilling ,\n6 hours ago A German tuner just unveiled a modified Audi RS 6 capable of making over 1,100 horsepower, or likely way more than you’ll ever need.\nInside an $8 Million Home in Upstate New York With Direct Access to a 4-Mile Racetrack\nMTM’s Pangaea GT is a darkly painted station wagon menace that is hiding the power of a supercar underneath its hood, though the wheels and general demeanor of the car do more than give it away.\nThe Audi RS 6 was already the marque’s most powerful car ever, making 621 horsepower from its twin-turbo V-8 engine, but the Pangaea GT almost doubles that number, making 1,100 horsepower from the 4.4-liter twin-turbo V-8 engine. That’s all thanks to tuning, meaning that the Pangaea GT will probably not make it to a million miles, or even 100,000, but it’s here for a good time, not a long time. The Audi RS 6 Avant is a family car with extra fun, while the Pangaea GT is intended for brutality.\nThe wheels are 22 inches, the transmission is an 8-speed automatic, and the power is sent to all four wheels. The stance has been lowered, too. There is a lot of carbon on the outside and inside, and Alcantara in the interior as well. Racing seats keep your body secure for high-speed cornering. MTM says it wants the Pangaea GT to be “addictive” to drive.\nThe MTM Pangaea GT gets ready to hit the track. MTM Time on the track may do that. MTM says the car can get from a stop to 62 mph in less than 2.6 seconds, with a top speed of at least 217 mph. Those numbers compare with a zero-to-60 time of 3.3 seconds on the Audi RS 6, and a top speed of 190 mph.\nBuffalo Trace Just Released the Strongest Version of Its Classic Sazerac Rye Whiskey\nMTM will make just 25 examples of the Pangaea GT, which it says was conceived, developed, and designed in Switzerland, which might lend an extra air of precision to things. The tuner did not announce a price, but a regular Audi RS 6 Avant starts at around $128,000, and it would not be a surprise if the Pangaea GT costs at least a quarter-million dollars or much more.\nA super-hot station wagon like the Pangaea GT is not uncommon at tracks in Europe, but it would be less so stateside, making it a more sophisticated choice for an enthusiast in the U.S. An owner could tell curious onlookers that it’s only one of 25, and they won’t wonder why.\nClick here for more photos of the MTM Pangaea GT.\nA Historic Cotswolds Gasworks Was Transformed Into a $2.5 Million Countryside Retreat\nMTM",
