  "text": "By Robb Report Studio ,\n1 days ago World-class chefs and their delicious creations weren’t the only showstoppers on display at this year’s Culinary Masters in Nashville. For three days, while gourmet foodies took over Music City, guests at the event were given privileged access to test drive the Porsche Macan Electric. This car isn’t just a state-of-the-art automobile, but a true exemplar of performance and design. Robb Report ’s automotive editor, Viju Mathew, was able to take the Macan for a spin around the city and meet with two Nashville-based artisans to discuss the importance of top-tier craftsmanship and artistry in their work.\nFlor de Caña Celebrates a Milestone Anniversary With a Milestone 35-Year-Old Rum\nCulinary Masters These values are exemplified within the Porsche Macan Electric, which is celebrated for its completely customizable interiors (including color palette, accessories, and materials) and innovative sound design.\nAnyone who has driven a Porsche, or even been a passenger, knows that precision and attention to detail are hallmarks of the brand. Every feature of the Macan Electric has been thought through, from the leather stitching of the interiors to the elegant Flyline of the exterior. This level of detail is something Porsche shares with the premium leather boot company, Lucchese.\nCulinary Masters As Fallon Appleton, Luchesse’s senior associate of marketing communications, explains, the history and tradition of the company are inextricably linked to its future. Lucchese began as a family business in the late 1800s and has grown and evolved through technological and design innovation. For example, the company invented the Twisted Cone Last, a tool which helped create the brand’s signature fit and is still used today. It essentially transformed cowboy boots from a purely flat-footed model to a supportive shoe designed for the ergonomics of modern-day living. This kind of innovation helped transform the company from one that only catered to U.S. Cavalry members to a national best-selling brand for both men and women.\nThe High-Flying Lifestyle of a Modern Texas Visionary\nCulinary Masters The next stop was Imagine Recordings, where similar to Porsche, sound is very important. For example, the “Porsche Electric Sport Sound System” enhances the driving experience to create an emotive Porsche-specific sound based on speed and torque. Of course, it matters a lot to Kam Luchterhand too. Inviting Mathew into the recording studio, the chart-topping sound engineer spoke about his life’s work, explaining the importance of technical innovation to sharpen, reinterpret, and fix imperfections in produced music. Luchterhand also explains that technological advances are only part of the story; imagination will always be an essential piece of the creative process. Because, for him, creating a song from scratch is like writing from a blank page: It’s a process that requires both creativity and technical precision.\nCulinary Masters To the untrained eye, Luchterhand says it might look like he’s just pushing faders in the studio, but there’s a magical alchemy happening across his board. He compares the engineering process to driving, where learning technical precision first allows for instinct to takeover.\nAt the 2025 Culinary Masters, guests were given the opportunity to learn about the creative process at Imagine Records and the craftsman legacy behind Lucchese. And being able to test drive the engineered elegance of the Porsche Macan Electric was the true cherry on top of an already sweet weekend. And luckily, Mathew was able to capture a little piece of that magic on film. So, whether you’re a car buff or an artisanal connoisseur, this is a chance to celebrate the excellence of these brands that pride themselves on true artistry and design.\nMayan Traditions Meet Modern Refined Design\nLearn more",
