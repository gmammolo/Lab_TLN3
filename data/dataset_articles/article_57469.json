  "text": "By Adam Hurly ,\n14 hours ago Welcome to Robb Recommends, a regular series in which our editors and contributors endorse something they’ve tried and loved—and think will change your life for the better.\nLoewe's New Fragrance Collection Turns Classic Ingredients on Their Head--in a Good Way\nFirst came the sleek hair dryers and toothbrushes. Now, Laifen is entering the electric shaving game, too.\nThe Hong Kong-based company’s latest launches, the T1 Pro and P3 Pro shavers, match the brand’s established aesthetics: minimal lines, aluminum construction, and muscled-up performance that competes with your Brauns, Panasonics, and Philips Norelcos.\nThey’re being called “the Apple of electric shavers,” and for good reason: It’s not just about that sleek design, but about the performance, too. Both tools’ aluminum bodies have the heft you want in an investment device, and their matte finishes read more like a tech object than a grooming device.\nLaifen’s new shavers are as sleek as they are effective. Adam Hurly The controls are reduced to a single multi-function button, which you can also press for a few seconds to activate a travel-safe lock—which means no errant buzzing in your dopp kit. My favorite feature is the sturdy magnetic heads that float right into place and stay put. This makes for consistent shaves, but also for easy rinsing and reassembly. (Click off, rinse, click back on.)\nBoth models are waterproof, so you can shave in the shower if you like, and they charge via USB-C. The design is so refined that even on the bathroom counter, they look more like they belong beside your phone charger, not your toothpaste.\nLaifen T1 Pro Compact, Elegant, and Interesting to Use\nThe T1 Pro is the more unique device, in my opinion, particularly in terms of design. It mimics a cartridge shaver with its long neck and T-shaped head. In that sense, the T1 is Laifen’s answer to Philips Norelco’s OneBlade, but with more elegance, less plastic, and a clearer design identity.\nThe standard fit is a single foil shaver, perfect for detailing edges or mowing over stubbled necklines. It does have a swappable trimmer head if you buy the Standard edition (the Stubble edition just has the shaver head). For better or for worse, it doesn’t overwhelm you with attachments or settings, even with the trimmer head: You get three guards for the trimmer—2 mm, 3 mm, and 5 mm—which slide into place on the head of the device (a little less smoothly than you’d hope, but once they’re, the sense of attachment is sturdy).\nFor men who maintain short beards or frequent stubble, it’s one of the most thoughtfully designed grooming tools to hit the market in years. The ergonomic, ultra-slim shape makes for more intuitive detailing and consistent results. My runtime tested around 270 minutes, which is over twice the advertised spec, so for what it’s worth, this is also one of the most travel-friendly shavers available. (I should add that it automatically switches off after 10 minutes of buzzing, so I had to re-engage it 27 times throughout the day before its white light switched to a flickering red, and then finally petered out.)\nThe Specs\nTested Run Time: 270 minutes\nTested Charge Time: 30 Minutes\nTested 1-Minute Quick Charge Run Time: 18 minutes\nTrimming Lengths: 2 mm, 3 mm, 5 mm\nCuts Per Minute: 12,000 (single linear motor)\nWaterproof: Yes\nColor Options: Silver, Space Gray, Blue\nLaifen P3 Pro Palm-Sized, Precise, and Powerful\nThe P3 Pro is Laifen’s flagship, going head to head with all other foil shavers—though its best comp is the recently released Arc5 Palm shaver from Panasonic. This one manages the same successful mowing-through with fewer head fixings (it comes with two foil shavers and a trimming bar that has teeth on both ends). This one feels a bit heftier in the hand compared to the Arc5 Palm, which isn’t bad or good, just worth noting that it feels a bit more muscled.\nThat weight comes with a sense of solidity. The aluminum frame doesn’t flex or rattle, and the motors glide through thick growth without strain. I was able to get it to mow down week-old facial fuzz, albeit with some patches. I did have to do a proper trimdown before it handled the stubble with perfection. I don’t expect it to cut through trimmable lengths, either. More of an observation that it is foremost a shaver, not a trimmer.\nIn testing, my device’s runtime hit 115 minutes, slightly above its 100-minute claim. The shave was equally strong wet or dry, with the foils staying cool even after extended passes. Like the T1, its magnetic head floats into place, and so does the magnetic cap that protects it while you’re traveling. It also has a travel mode to prevent humming while flying; just hold the button for a few seconds to engage the lock. Hold it again to disengage.\nOne mystery: where do the clippings go? I swear, I trimmed decent lengths every time I tested it, and yet, I open the head expecting a pile of hair and find… nothing. It’s as if the machine vaporizes the stubble. Regardless, cleanup takes seconds, and the shaver always feels fresh for the next round.\nThe P3 Pro isn’t just powerful, but it is also quite handsome. For frequent shavers, it’s a near-perfect balance of strength, refinement, and ease of use.\nThe Specs\nTested Run Time: 115 minutes\nTested Charge Time: 30 Minutes\nTested 1-Minute Quick Charge Run Time: 5 minutes\nCuts Per Minute: 24,000 (dual linear motors)\nWaterproof: Yes\nColor Options: Silver, Space Gray",
