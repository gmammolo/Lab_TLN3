  "text": "Key Points\n- DIYer Naomi Gray transforms a plain fridge using inexpensive window film.\n- The project went viral, inspiring others to try window film on appliances.\n- The method is renter-friendly, easy, and enhances kitchen style for under $10.\nAfter a while, ordinary appliances around the house can end up feeling bland and boring, especially if you’re someone who loves turning every corner of your space into something that feels like it came right off a Pinterest board.\nThat being said, it may not bother you or even be something you notice, but your fridge is probably one of those everyday must-haves that is functional yet feels like the style buzzkill of the kitchen.\nWho says your fridge has to stay plain and outdated, though? One DIYer is proving it doesn’t have to with an incredible transformation that combines dopamine decorating with a stroke of renter-friendly genius. Something that many people were on board with, as it quickly garnered over a million views on TikTok.\nTurning a Refrigerator Into a Stylish Standout Using Window Film\nIt may sound unexpected, but sometimes the best things are. While home creator and DIYer Naomi says taking window film and applying it to her fridge isn’t “exactly what it was made for,” she still loves how effortlessly it changed her kitchen’s vibe.\nIn fact, she describes it as “the best whimsy decision you’ve [she’s] ever made.” And with how stunning the results are, we totally get it.\nIn her video, Naomi starts off with an ordinary fridge filled with pictures and magnets. Using the magic of DIY, she transforms it into a showstopper that seamlessly complements and enhances the room’s style.\nImmediately, users in the comments were obsessed. Some started sharing their own game-changing window film fridge transformations. Others began brainstorming ways to apply this method to other household essentials, such as dishwashers.\nHow to Transform a Refrigerator Using Window Film\nIf you’re totally inspired to try this out in your home, here’s how Naomi did it.\nFirst, before applying the film, she removes all the magnets and photos from her fridge. Lining the film up as she wants it to lie, she sprays the fridge with water, tears off the transparent static film, and applies it to her fridge. As a major bonus, the film she picks is available for just $8.19 on Amazon. Considering how much this levels up the style of her kitchen, it’s well worth the price.\nAfter she applies it, she smooths out the film and adjusts it to fit the fridge perfectly. “It actually went on very, very easy,” she explains, praising it as super renter-friendly and a big-impact DIY.\nIt’s no wonder this fridge makeover went completely viral. Try it out on your fridge for a DIY guaranteed to make a stunning statement in your kitchen.\nDIYer Turns Everyday Glasses Into ‘Incredible’ Lookalikes of Anthropologie’s Bestselling Glassware\n‘Oh we’re definitely having a DIY Christmas.’\nJessica Kaplan\nAbout the author\nJessica Kaplan\nNews Writer, DenGarden",
