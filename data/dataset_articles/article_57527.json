  "text": "The new Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Fiji Airways, Paul Scurrah has promised that Fiji Airways is the happiest airline in the world and he has every confidence that this claim is one they can truly stand behind.\nFiji Airways officially welcomed Scurrah, through a traditional Fijian ceremony held in Nadi at the their head office.\nThe national airline says the event celebrated his appointment and reaffirmed the airline’s commitment to Fijian culture, people, and world-class excellence.\nThey say the ceremony, deeply rooted in Fijian tradition and symbolism, brought together Fiji Airways staff in a heartfelt celebration of culture and connection.\nScurrah also expressed his sincere gratitude for the warmth and generosity of his welcome.\nHe says the spirit of unity and pride shown truly reflects what makes the airline and its people so special.\nScurrah says to stand here among the Fiji Airways Vuvale, the people who make this airline what it is, is both an honour and a privilege.\nHe also took the opportunity to commend the entire Fiji Airways team for their continued achievements, including the airline’s latest international accolades.\nThe new CEO further says just last night, at the prestigious APEX Awards in Singapore, Fiji Airways won Best Cabin Service and Best Food & Beverage in the South Pacific for 2026, recognition based on more than one million verified passenger votes.\nHe says these awards affirm that the warmth and authenticity we are known for as Fijians are being felt by our guests around the world.\nScurrah reaffirmed his commitment to leading the airline with humility, focus, and respect, adding that his promise is simple - safety will always come first.\nHe stresses he will listen, learn, and lead with humility, build on the strong foundation already in place - continuing to deliver world-class service, expand the network, and ensure every guest feels the mana of Fiji on every journey.\nThe new CEO further says one powerful lesson that COVID has taught is that nothing in the airline industry can or should ever be taken for granted.\nHe says the effort it took to get here must be matched by the effort to keep improving, because if they not growing and evolving, they will quickly be left behind.\nScurrah stresses their success does not come from aircraft or infrastructure, it comes from our people and their pride, professionalism, and passion are what keep them flying high.\nHe adds they will continue to grow the airline, strengthen their culture, and show the world what the spirit of Fiji truly means.\nStay tuned for the latest news on our radio stations",
