  "text": "The first annual “Night of Hope” event is scheduled for Sunday evening at City Church. Kelsie Hendricks, who is putting on the event, said it is a night for the community to come together and celebrate the hope of eternal life, especially those who lost loved ones in the last year.\nHendricks’ husband Tyler died at 38 in a car accident almost exactly a year ago, leaving behind their two daughters — one 2 1/2 years old and one 3 months old.",
