  "text": "According to search data from digital travel platform Agoda, as the brilliant red-and-gold leaves sweep across the RoK and Japan, travel interest among Vietnamese tourists to these two countries has surged sharply. Searches for the RoK jumped by 55%, while those for Japan rose by 24% compared to the summer season.\nBased on Vietnamese users’ accommodation search activity for autumn holidays (October–November) versus summer (June–July), it is clear that Vietnamese people’s “love affair” with the RoK remains as strong as ever, especially during the picturesque foliage season.\nSeoul and Busan lead the list of most-searched destinations in the RoK, with increases of 63% and 67%, respectively, followed by Jeju and Incheon, up 29%, and Gyeongju-si, which recorded an impressive 86% rise.\nJapan’s autumn, with its stunning foliage, also continues to captivate Vietnamese travellers, with searches having grown by 24% compared to summer.\nTokyo topped the search rankings with a 6% increase, drawing visitors eager to witness the changing colours amid the bustling capital. It was followed by Osaka (up 30%), along with Kyoto (73%), Fukuoka (28%), and Nagoya (36%), rounding out the top five most-searched Japanese destinations for Vietnamese tourists this autumn.",
