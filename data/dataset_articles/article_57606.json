View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251112722740/en/\nStudies reviewed by Kindness.org reveal that “kindness is good for you,” showing that natural and prosocial audio can boost emotional wellness—lowering stress, enhancing mood, and encouraging prosocial behavior.ii Inspired by these insights, all of e.l.f. Beauty’s brands—e.l.f. Cosmetics, e.l.f. SKIN, Well People, Keys Soulcare, Naturium, and rhode—along with Beekman 1802 and Kindness.org, have created unique audiovisual stories designed to interrupt the content on users’ feeds. Each “Sound of Kindness” asset brings to life a thoughtfully curated soundscape, accompanied by a call to action to pay it forward and share these moments with others.\n“Kindness isn’t just a feeling—it’s a force. It changes our chemistry, rewires our thinking, and strengthens our communities,” said Kory Marchisotto, Chief Marketing Officer of e.l.f. Beauty. “We created ‘The Sound of Kindness’ with Kindness.org and Beekman 1802 to highlight the power of force-multiplying with kindred spirits, aspiring to create an algorithm that is more positive, inclusive, and accessible. It’s a small ask with a big impact. For me, the sound of purring cats fuels me to make the world a better place—for every eye, lip, and face.”\nSound transforms everyday moments into cultural touchpoints that inspire connection, celebration and community. It serves as a data point for social platforms affecting discovery, engagement, and content tailored to users’ preferences, similar to hashtags and trends.\n“Sound is such a core part of the TikTok experience, uniting a global community through creativity, expression, and joy.

Beauty, Beekman 1802, and all of the brands in this campaign for celebrating World Kindness Day in such a creative and meaningful way, turning insight into action and inspiring a ripple of kindness and connection around the world.”\nBuilding on last year’s World Kindness Day collaboration, e.l.f. and Beekman 1802 are returning to Roblox with “The Sound of Kindness.” Players can explore an immersive world filled with kindness-inspired sounds, discover Beekman’s beloved baby goats hidden throughout the map, and welcome them to their own “Kind Farm.” Launching November 13, the experience blends beauty and play in a fun, unexpected way.\n\"At Beekman 1802, we always celebrate World Kindness Day as a key part of our holiday season.
