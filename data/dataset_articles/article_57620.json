Makalawena Beach (Kailua-Kona)\nWant to know what paradise looked like before hotels and gift shops?\nMakalawena Beach is your answer!\nThis hidden gem on the Big Island’s Kona Coast requires some effort to reach – a 20-minute hike across a lava field.\nThe trek keeps the crowds away and preserves the beach’s pristine beauty.\nThe sand here is so white and fine it squeaks under your feet.\nIt’s like walking on powdered sugar, only it won’t give you a sugar rush – just pure beach bliss.\nCrystal clear waters in shades of turquoise and blue invite you in for a swim.\nThe gentle curve of the shoreline creates protected areas perfect for floating without a care in the world.\nSnorkeling here reveals an underwater neighborhood bustling with colorful fish.\nThey dart around the coral formations like they’re late for an important fish meeting.\nPalm trees dot the shoreline, offering natural shade when the Hawaiian sun decides to really show off.\nThese aren’t landscaped trees – they’re the real deal, growing wild and free.\nThe beach actually consists of several coves, each with its own personality.\nIt’s like beach speed-dating – you can try them all and pick your favorite!\nPack a picnic and plenty of water because there are no concession stands here.\nThis is old-school beaching – just you, the sand, and the sea.\nTide pools near the northern end of the beach create natural aquariums where kids (and kids at heart) can observe small sea creatures up close.\nIt’s like a free marine biology lesson!\nThe views of Maui’s mountains across the channel add another layer of magic to this already enchanted spot.\nOn clear days, the sight is nothing short of spectacular.\nWhere: HI-19, Kailua-Kona, HI 96740\n4.

Honokōwai Beach Park (Lahaina)\nEver found a place that feels like it was waiting just for you?\nThat’s the magic of Honokōwai Beach Park!\nThis unassuming stretch of coastline sits between the busier Ka’anapali and Kapalua beaches on Maui’s west side.\nWhile tourists flock to its famous neighbors, Honokōwai quietly offers its charms to those in the know.\nThe beach itself is narrow but extends for a good distance, giving everyone space to spread out.\nThe sand has a lovely golden hue that glows warmly in the afternoon sun.\nA grassy park area backs the beach, perfect for picnics or just lounging in the shade.\nThe tall palm trees sway in the breeze like they’re dancing to music only they can hear.\nThe offshore reef creates relatively calm waters, making this a good spot for beginning snorkelers.\nThe fish here don’t seem to have gotten the memo about being shy around humans.\nMorning visitors might spot green sea turtles feeding on the seaweed near the shoreline.\nThese gentle creatures go about their breakfast business, unbothered by their human admirers.\nThe beach park has actual facilities – restrooms, showers, and picnic tables – making it family-friendly.\nSometimes luxury is as simple as having a place to rinse the sand off your feet!\nSunset here is a local favorite.\nThe sky puts on a color show that would make even the most experienced painter doubt their ability to capture such beauty.\nThe Honokōwai Stream meets the ocean at the south end of the beach, creating an interesting freshwater-meets-saltwater ecosystem.\nIt’s like watching two old friends greet each other after a long journey apart.\nThis beach somehow manages to feel both accessible and secret at the same time.\nIt’s hiding in plain sight – the best kind of hiding spot!\nWhere: Lahaina, HI 96761\n6.

Waipi’o Black Sand Beach (Honokaa)\nEver seen sand that looks like it came from another planet?\nWelcome to Waipi’o Black Sand Beach, where Mother Nature shows off her artistic side!\nThis dramatic beach sits at the mouth of the sacred Waipi’o Valley on the Big Island’s northeastern shore.\nThe Hawaiians call this place “The Valley of the Kings” – and one look tells you why.\nMassive cliffs rise nearly 2,000 feet on three sides of the valley, creating a backdrop that makes your jaw drop.\nIt’s like standing in a natural cathedral built by giants.\nThe beach stretches about a mile long, with sand as black as midnight.\nThis isn’t your typical beach sand – it’s created from lava rock, pulverized by the relentless ocean into fine, dark grains.\nGetting here requires either a four-wheel-drive vehicle or strong legs willing to hike down (and back up!) a steep road with a 25% grade.\nThe journey itself is part of the adventure.\nThe Waipi’o River meets the ocean here, creating a freshwater swimming option when the ocean is too rough.\nThe river water is cool and refreshing – nature’s own air conditioning.\nWild horses sometimes roam the beach and valley, descendants of animals that escaped from sugar plantations long ago.\nThey add an element of untamed beauty to an already magical setting.\nThe waves here can be powerful and unpredictable.\nSwimming is often dangerous, but watching the ocean’s power from the safety of shore is its own kind of thrill.\nThis valley was once home to thousands of native Hawaiians and was an important cultural center.\nYou can feel the history in the air – it’s thick with stories and memories.\nThe beach changes dramatically with the seasons.\nWinter storms can reshape the shoreline overnight, while summer brings calmer waters and wider stretches of sand.\nWhere: Waipio Valley Rd, Honokaa, HI 96727\n8. Kehena Black Sand Beach (Big Island)\nThink all beaches are created equal?\nKehena Beach will quickly change your mind!\nThis stunning black sand beach on the Big Island’s eastern shore emerged from a 1955 lava flow.\nThat’s right – this beach is younger than many of the people who visit it!\nTucked below a 20-foot cliff along the dramatic Puna coastline, Kehena requires a short but steep scramble to access.\nThe path down might make you question your choices, but the view from below makes it all worthwhile.\nThe beach stretches about 300 feet in a crescent shape, embraced by lava rock formations on both ends.\nThe black sand feels different under your feet – coarser than white sand, with an almost magical sparkle in the sunlight.\nSpinner dolphins frequently visit the bay, putting on acrobatic shows for beachgoers.\nThey leap and twirl like they’re auditioning for a nature documentary.\nThe water here is a striking blue against the black sand – a contrast that never fails to amaze.\nIt’s like Mother Nature decided to play with her color palette just to see what would happen.\nThis beach has earned the nickname “Dolphin Beach” from locals because of its frequent marine visitors.\nThe dolphins seem to consider this their favorite hangout spot.\nThe currents can be strong, and there are no lifeguards on duty.\nSwimming here requires respect for the ocean and awareness of your own abilities.\nSunday afternoons bring an informal gathering of locals who often bring drums and other instruments.\nThe beach transforms into an impromptu celebration of life, music, and nature.\nKehena has a clothing-optional section, reflecting the free-spirited nature of the Puna district.\nIt’s all very laid-back – no judgment, just people enjoying nature in different ways.\nThe surrounding area is lush with tropical vegetation that somehow manages to thrive on the volcanic landscape.\nLife finds a way, even in the most unlikely places.\nWhere: Big Island, HI 96778\nHawaii’s natural beach treasures are calling your name!\nBring water, sunscreen, and a camera to capture memories that will last a lifetime.\nThese gorgeous coastal hideaways show the true spirit of the islands – wild, beautiful, and unforgettable!",
