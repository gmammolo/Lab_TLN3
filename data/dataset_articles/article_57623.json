  "text": "Lotto: Perth man celebrates $1.25 windfall with humble meal to bring him ‘back down to planet earth’\nChloe MaherPerthNow\nMost people may celebrate a division one Lotto win by booking a dream holiday, beginning the hunt for a house, or popping a pricey bottle of bubbles, but a Perth winner had more humble plans in mind — tucking in to a homemade chicken sandwich.\nThe man, aged in his 80s, matched the numbers to take out a $1.25m slice of Saturday’s $10m jackpot drawn on November 8 after purchasing the slip from The Lucky Charm in Bassendean.\nShocked by his stunning windfall, the eastern suburbs man turned to his fridge in a bid to digest the life-changing news.\n“I was completely dumbfounded after finding out I’d won, I couldn’t believe it,” he said.\n“To calm down, I thought I’d make myself something to eat.\n“There wasn’t much in the fridge, but I managed to cobble together a chicken sandwich which brought me back down to planet earth.”\nThe winner has more lavish plans in store to spend his new-found fortune after the mammoth win sinks in.\n“I’ve always wanted to go on a cruise, somewhere warm and sunny, so I’m grateful I’ll be able to tick that off my bucket list,” he said.\nAnother WA ticketholder, who purchased their winning ticket online, hit the same Saturday jackpot and is yet to come forward to collect their cash.\nPunters will be able to try their luck in Thursday’s colossal $50m draw, with tickets available for purchase in-store and online until 6pm.",
