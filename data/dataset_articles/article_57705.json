He advised them to be content with what God has provided for them.\nThe cleric said nobody should be tempted to borrow money in order to celebrate Christmas. He also admonished them not to in commit sin, even after the of celebration.\nEsther Habu and Rebecca Ashana who were among the women worshippers expressed gratitude to God for enabling them to witness the day, and prayed that He would also enable them to witness another one.",
