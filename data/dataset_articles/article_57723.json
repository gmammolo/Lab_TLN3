Big revelation. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Hrithik Roshan (@hrithikroshan) Hrithik and Saba have been dating for a couple of years now. Rumours about their relationship started swirling after they were spotted on a dinner date in February 2022. Later, she also joined Hrithiks family for a get-together. All speculation on their relationship was set at rest after the two walked hand-in-hand at actor Karan Johars 50th birthday bash in May 2022. Saba often accompanies Hrithik for family outings, celebrations and vacations. Hrithik was previously married to Sussanne Khan, the daughter of veteran actor Sanjay Khan.",
