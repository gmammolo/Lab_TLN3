  "text": "- By\nBornika Das - Thu, 01 Jan 2026 11:18 AM (IST)\n- Source:JND\nNew Year Hangover Remedies: As we bid goodbye to 2025 and welcome 2026 with wide arms, we keep no regrets. The excitement and celebrations are everywhere, with merrymaking parties, full of drinking, dancing and nocturnal commemorations. This enjoyment can result in a painful and miserable New Year's morning hangover that can dim your shine and sparkle. Symptoms like pounding headaches, vomiting, lethargy and dehydration can feel stronger and last longer, sometimes from 8 to 24 hours after the New Year's bash. However, fret not! With the easy and quick home remedies, you can easily get rid of a hangover.\nWhat Causes A Hangover?\nAlcohol is a diuretic, meaning it makes you lose water quickly. This leads to dehydration, which causes headaches, dizziness and weakness. While there is no guaranteed cure for a hangover, with simple DIY home cures, you can alleviate headaches, calm an upset stomach and make the morning after a little easier. Here are the easy home remedies to get rid of a New Year's hangover.\nQuick Hangover Cures That Actually Work In 2026\nHydration\nIt is important to drink plenty of water to reduce the effects of a hangover. Dehydration is the leading cause of hangovers, so keep a water bottle handy and sip regularly.\nORS\nPeople often vomit after drinking, which can drain their bodies of essential salts and potassium. Replenish them with ORS, along with fruit juices or coconut water.\nWater-Rich Foods\nAfter a night of heavy drinking, your stomach may struggle with heavy foods. Go for something light like watermelon. Bananas and oats are also good options.\nHome Remedies To Get Rid Of Hangover (Image Credits: Canva)\nVitamins\nMultivitamins can support recovery. A glass of fresh orange juice is another great way to top up your vitamin C. You can also choose to suck lemon slices, which can sometimes ease the feeling of sickness.\nSleep\nRest is as important as hydration. Skip plans if you need to, let your body recover and sleep as long as necessary.\nALSO READ: Happy New Year 2026: 10 Beautiful Greeting Cards To Share Love, Luck And New Beginnings\nShower\nAfter you feel a little better, take a cool shower, which can help you feel lighter and more relaxed.\nSkip Caffeine\nWhile coffee may be tempting, it is also diuretic in nature, which can worsen dehydration and nausea. Thus, it is better to avoid tea or coffee until you feel fully recovered.\nIn 2026, opt for home remedies to get rid of a hangover, rather than chemical relief. These simple home remedies will help you overcome hangovers and help you enjoy the moment after the New Year party bash as well.",
