Champagne not included.\n- Regency Inn (two queen beds) 2378 Colorado Blvd. $299\n- The Hills Inn Eagle Rock (one king bed) 2300 Colorado Blvd. $480.\n- The Welcome Inn (one king bed) 1840 Colorado Blvd. $300 + $5 a day parking.\n- Islander Hotel (queen bed suite) 1460 Colorado Boulevard. $100.\n- Eagle Rock Motel (one king bed) 7041 N. Figueroa. $207.\nTwo motels -- Casa Lu-An and the Rosebowl Motel -- have no openings for New Year’s Eve.\nPrefer a house instead of a motel? Airbnb showed just one New Year’s Eve listing available — $1,000 for a single night, behind the Eagle Rock Plaza.\nHappy New Year!\n👍👎 Eastsider Reader Poll\nLast time we asked: How would you describe 2025?\nAnd readers responded:\nSome of your comments:\n“We had a year that started with fire, then we got invaded and occupied by our own National Guard. Every day another ICE raid, with our loved ones disappearing. More than exhausting. Horrible.”\n“So much going on locally, nationally and internationally, it’s hard to take it all in.”\n“It was a demanding year from start to finish. A lot of work, a lot of uncertainty, and a lot of resilience required.”\n“I am new to LA, and I have embraced the lifestyle that comes with being here.”\nEditor’s Note: No one selected the fourth option, “Better than expected.” May the next year make up for the last one. Speaking of which….\nHow do you feel about New Year's Resolutions?\nThe results and comments will be published in a future Eastsider Newsletter.\n🗒️ Notebook\nTeen and dog fight cancer together\nEast Hollywood—A teenage boy and a 10-year-old therapy dog bonded instantly at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, as they went through cancer treatment together.
