  "text": "SIX weeks of school holidays can feel like a long stretch, but staying home doesn’t have to mean endless TV or squabbles.\nWith budgets tight, home-based fun is the perfect way to make memories without breaking the bank. Here are six creative ideas to keep the whole family entertained.\n1. Party games\nWho says party games are only for birthdays? Gather some neighbours or friends and throw a mini holiday party at home. Simple, low-cost games can spark hours of laughter:\n· The Chocolate Game: Roll a dice and try to unwrap and eat chocolate with a knife and fork when a six is thrown — hurry before the next six!\n· Pass the Parcel: No fancy wrapping needed — even newspaper works! The fun is in the passing and surprises.\n· Musical Statues or Chairs: Easy to set up and guaranteed giggles.\n2. Bounce it out\nKeep the energy flowing by hiring a jumping castle or setting up a slip-and-slide in the garden for a day. Share costs with friends or neighbours to make it affordable and watch the kids burn off that holiday energy.\n3. Cool down with water fun\nNot everyone has a pool, but water is always a winner in summer. Set up a hose, sprinkler, or even a DIY water balloon fight. The kids will stay active and refreshed without leaving home.\n4. Backyard obstacle course\nTurn the garden into a mini adventure park! Use items you already have to build an obstacle course:\n· Rope for balancing\n· Boxes and chairs to climb over\n· Toys or cushions to jump around\n· Trees or garden posts for a climbing challenge\nTime the kids and let them compete for fun prizes — friendly rivalry adds a bit of excitement!\n5. Treasure hunt\nHide small items like golf balls, toys, or little treats around the garden and send the kids on a treasure hunt. For an extra challenge, create clues or a hand-drawn map to make them feel like true explorers.\n6. Backyard camp out\nSet up a tent in the garden, throw in blankets and pillows, and enjoy a night under the stars. Roast marshmallows or make s’mores on a braai, tell stories, and enjoy the novelty of camping without leaving home. This is a simple yet unforgettable experience.\nQuick tips for stay-at-home holidays\n· Rotate activities to keep things fresh.\n· Include kids in the planning as they’ll be more engaged.\n· Encourage creativity by letting them invent new games or challenges.\n· Keep snacks and hydration handy, especially for outdoor fun.\nWith a little creativity, holidays at home can be just as magical as a getaway and the memories will last long after the last school bell rings.\nDon’t have the ZO app?
