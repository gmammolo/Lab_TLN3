  "text": "More Chinese travellers are pivoting from mass-market sightseeing to bespoke adventures to ring in the new year, fuelling a surge in demand for pet-friendly itineraries and winter excursions as service consumption defies a broader economic gloom.\\n“Tailored travel is gaining traction,” online travel platform Fliggy said in a December 23 statement, citing a shift towards immersive “experiences that go beyond sightseeing”, favouring more memorable moments and personalisation.\\nIn particular, searches for specific niche trips such as aurora-viewing expeditions and pet-inclusive packages soared by 200 per cent for the coming holiday, year on year, according to the platform’s data.\\nMeanwhile, interest in New Year’s Eve activities – including performances, fireworks and light shows – has jumped 58 per cent.\\nFliggy is a subsidiary of Alibaba Group, owner of the South China Morning Post.\\nBoutique agencies are also capitalising on the trend. Zhong Yi, who runs Yuefeixiang, which specialises in tailored pet-inclusive trips to the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, said inquiries for the New Year’s holiday have at least tripled, compared with last year.\\n“These owners raise their dogs as if they were their own ‘fur kids’ and want to take them out travelling,” he said, adding that such trips provide “greater emotional value”.\\nThe logistical hurdles of travelling with animals create a niche for specialised agencies, which navigate airline regulations and arrange pet-friendly ground transport.\\nYounger travellers have more diverse and personalised travel preferences, placing greater emphasis on the overall experience\\nChinese travel agency Utour\\nWith pet ownership on the rise in China, authorities have identified the industry as a potential driver of domestic consumption. And a June report by KPMG highlighted the sector’s strong growth momentum, projecting that the market size would exceed 811.4 billion yuan (US$115 billion) this year.\\nZhong noted that his main client base – urbanites in their twenties and early thirties from cities such as Shanghai – have grown increasingly discontent with confined spaces or small urban parks, and instead want to take their dogs to much wider open spaces.\\nHis private tours allow dogs to roam Xinjiang’s snowy landscapes as owners count down to the new year surrounded by nature.\\nSnow-related activities, including winter sports, have similarly emerged as a cornerstone of the holiday’s tailored tourism market.\\n“Younger travellers have more diverse and personalised travel preferences, placing greater emphasis on the overall experience,” Chinese travel agency Utour said in a report on December 23.\\nSki resorts blending professional slopes with abundant entertainment activities have become popular destinations for the season, the agency said.\\nThe winter travel rush serves as a bright spot for China’s economy.\\nWhile broader consumer spending has remained soft – weighed down by a prolonged property slump and a challenging job market – households are increasingly channelling disposable income into dining, tourism and other activities.\\n",
