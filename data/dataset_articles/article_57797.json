  "text": "Christmas is over, and we are looking forward to a New Year that will be the best yet. At this time of year, most people think about resolutions and promises to use that gym membership, learn to cook or take up another language, whatever floats their boat.\nWe readily admit that we rarely stick with these for long, and then guilt sets in. So, it might be a better idea to sweep out the old with the year that has just gone by, and practice something that will make us feel better in the New Year.\nStarting with a clean sheet, we can plan to streamline our lives and only keep (and use) things we have neglected in the last few months.\nNew Year Beauty\nIn beauty, we tend to have more than we need, so it might be time to clear out what you don't use and stick to a specific routine in the New Year. In the morning, we need serum, moisturiser, and sunscreen. At night, we use serum and night cream.\nInto these daily regimes, you might commit to using vitamin C in the morning for brighter, more even-toned skin and fewer dark spots. And, in the evening before bed, you might start using retinol once or twice a week for smoother, plumper, and more radiant skin.\nOut With The Old\nMinor tweaks like this should reduce how many lotions and potions you hold on to, clear some shelf space, and save some money. We could also resolve this year to buy wisely; no one needs 10 pairs of black trousers, and the same goes for nude lipsticks.\nMaybe we should buy something new only when we run out, and we can also make a promise not to be swayed by social media ads, glossy campaigns, or influencers telling us we need some magic cream that erases lines or pores.\nClean Sweep\nThis New Year clean sweep can also be applied to our fashion choices, where a keep, dump, or donate approach should help you build a capsule wardrobe that serves you rather than swamps you every time you open the doors. It can be freeing to part with clutter, and maybe that's what we should consider doing in January, when we have all the time to do it, since nothing else is going on.\nEven if you do jump on a trend that promises a fabulous body by summer, or you become so fluent in French that you can relocate to the Riviera by June, at least you will have rid yourself and your home of the clutter that bogs you down.\nHappy 2026\nIf you don't have the bikini body or language skills to move to Europe, it will be much more enjoyable to have a clean, serene home and a beauty bag.\nThat, by itself, is the type of New Year resolution most of us can take on board and feel the better of it by following through.\n*This post may contain affiliate links",
