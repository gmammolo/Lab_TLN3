  "text": "PUTRAJAYA, Jan 29 (Bernama) -- The Enforcement Agency Integrity Commission (EAIC) has thrown its full support behind Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s firm stance that the government can no longer tolerate unaddressed weaknesses in enforcement and governance.\nEAIC chairman Tan Sri Dr Ismail Bakar said in a statement today that the commission takes the warning seriously, noting that it aligns with EAIC’s ongoing monitoring and investigations into misconduct.\n“These include abuse of power and weaknesses in the integrity governance ecosystem of the public service, particularly within enforcement agencies,” he said.\nIsmail stressed that disciplinary action recommendations put forward by the EAIC, including proposals to improve systems and internal procedures, must be given serious attention and fully implemented.\n“EAIC will also refer disciplinary cases that have not been acted upon to the relevant Disciplinary Authority and forward them to the respective heads of service for immediate action.\n“Firm action and compliance by heads of departments are crucial to strengthening enforcement integrity and restoring public confidence in national institutions,” he said.\nIsmail added that smuggling, corruption and illicit activities not only undermine the credibility of enforcement agencies but also constitute a betrayal of public and national interests, and must not be tolerated or normalised under any circumstances.\nYesterday, the Prime Minister warned that the government would no longer compromise on enforcement and governance weaknesses that are not taken seriously.\nAnwar also gave enforcement chiefs one week to confirm their willingness to uphold their responsibilities or opt to be reassigned to other positions.\n-- BERNAMA\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial\n© 2026 BERNAMA\n• Disclaimer\n• Privacy Policy\n• Security Policy",
