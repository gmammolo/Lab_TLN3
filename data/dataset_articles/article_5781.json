  "text": "Title: Owner\nOrganization: ACS Cleaning & Restoration (Disaster Restoration Industry)\nAge: 27\nBorn and raised in Mexico City, I immigrated to Chicago at the age of 8 with the excitement of meeting my father for the first time. He had left our family when I was just one, determined to build a better life for us. From a young age, I witnessed the hardships that immigrants face. I saw firsthand the abuse my father endured just to keep his job as a custodian, and I vowed to one day create a business that treated people with fairness and respect.\nAfter high school, my father was fired due to his immigration status, and that’s when the real journey began. Together, we founded America’s Cleaning Services. At the time, I had little business knowledge, and my youth made me an easy target for exploitation—undervalued and overcharged. However, those early struggles taught me invaluable lessons. I learned to navigate a tough industry, build relationships, and create real opportunities for growth.\nOver the years, I’ve been blessed to have incredible mentors who shaped me into the leader I am today. Their guidance has allowed me to lead with integrity and vision. At ACS, our mission is to create a solid foundation that ensures sustainable growth without unnecessary struggles.\nToday, I’m proud to be the owner and leader of a company that employs 20 individuals, and I’m working towards growing to have an even greater impact. As a Mexican immigrant, I’m deeply committed to providing my people with the resources and opportunities they need to succeed in this country.",
