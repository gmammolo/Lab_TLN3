  "text": "Wrexham County Borough Council welcomes today’s court outcome following long‑running and serious noise nuisance issues linked to persistent dog barking and associated disturbances at Holly Walks, Wrexham.\nSince December 2022, the Council has received repeated complaints from neighbouring households regarding continuous barking from multiple dogs kept at the property. Over this period, four separate noise‑monitoring exercises were carried out, capturing a total of 965 barking episodes, many occurring late at night and causing significant and ongoing distress to nearby residents.\nDespite the service of a Statutory Abatement Notice and a successful prosecution in November 2024, the nuisance continued unabated. Noise recordings and further monitoring in early 2025 confirmed further ongoing breaches, leaving residents exposed to prolonged harassment, alarm and disturbance.\nAt Wrexham Magistrates’ Court today, the defendant entered a guilty plea to nine offences relating to breaches of a Community Protection Notice. The court imposed:\n- A fine of £2,250\n- Court costs of £4,046\n- A Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) lasting two years\nThe Criminal Behaviour Order prohibits the defendant or other person/s from:\n- Keeping dogs at The property on Holly Walks, Wrexham at any time\n- Causing any noise nuisance at Holly Walks, Wrexham at any time\nThe Order also requires the defendant to:\n- Surrender all dogs currently and future on the premises to Wrexham County Borough Council, to be safely re-homed.\nLead Member for Strategic Planning and Public Protection Cllr Hugh Jones said “This outcome reflects the seriousness of the prolonged impact on the community and the Council’s commitment to protecting residents’ right to peaceful enjoyment of their homes. “We will continue to monitor compliance with the CBO and will take further action if required.”",
