  "text": "Crime across the Bay Area Rapid Transit system fell significantly in 2025, even as ridership increased, according to new data released by Bay Area Rapid Transit.\nOverall crime on BART declined 41% compared to 2024, with violent crime down 31% and property crime falling 43%, according to the agency’s December 2025 Chief’s Monthly Report. Auto thefts dropped by nearly half year over year, while robberies decreased by 60%.\nThe decline in crime comes as more riders returned to the system. BART recorded nearly 5 million additional trips in 2025 compared with the previous year, continuing a trend that has seen ridership growth alongside falling crime rates.\nBART Police Chief Kevin Franklin said the results reflect a broader approach to public safety that goes beyond enforcement alone.\n“Safety is about more than enforcement. It’s about presence, partnership, and creating an environment where all riders feel comfortable using BART,” Franklin said. “These numbers demonstrate the impact of officers who are engaged and focused on building trust with the communities BART serves.”\nBART General Manager Bob Powers credited a combination of infrastructure upgrades and increased safety staffing for improving the rider experience.\n“Riders are witnessing firsthand the improvements to safety, cleanliness, and customer experience that define the New BART,” Powers said. “We’ve combined infrastructure upgrades with additional safety presence and customer-centered service to make BART a comfortable experience for everyone.”\nIn 2025, BART doubled visible police presence systemwide and increased the number of officers riding trains. Those efforts were supplemented by unarmed Crisis Intervention Specialists, Transit Ambassadors, Fare Inspectors, and Community Service Officers.\nSafety measures were further strengthened by the installation of 715 new fare gates at all 50 stations, a project completed four months ahead of schedule in August 2025. The taller, reinforced gates are designed to deter fare evasion and disruptive behavior. According to BART, the number of riders who reported witnessing fare evasion dropped 59% over the past year.\nThe agency also operates more than 4,000 surveillance cameras throughout the system and continues to upgrade station and parking area lighting with LED fixtures to reduce dark areas and improve visibility.\nBART officials say the combined efforts have not only reduced crime, but also contributed to a more welcoming and reliable transit experience for riders across the region.",
