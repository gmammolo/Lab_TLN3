  "text": "What the Stars Have in Store for You in 2026\nWhat do the stars say for 2026? First of all, there is good news: In love, career, and health, things look good for all zodiac signs, new opportunities arise, and emotional strength should be present for everyone. But how does it look for each zodiac sign individually?\nCapricorn (12/22-1/20)\nFor Capricorns, 2026 will be a good year - especially in love. It's time to trust and let go of a little control. Singles can look forward to an encounter that combines true stability and passion. And things look good professionally as well: With a lot of perseverance, a passion project could be completed, and hard work will also be rewarded. Despite all the ambition, it's also important to pay attention to regular breaks.\nAquarius (1/21-2/19)\nThe new year brings many changes.

Honest conversations deepen existing relationships and bring new encounters for singles. To advance professionally, clear plans and structure are needed. It is important not to neglect time for oneself, best achieved through regular stays in nature.\nAries (3/21-4/20)\nThe start of the year will be passionate. The peak will be in the spring, during which it is particularly worthwhile to communicate clearly and address conflicts. Aries are ambitious, but it is important not to take on too much professionally and to adhere to clear planning steps.\nTaurus (21.4.-20.5.)\nTaurus can look forward to a harmonious year in 2026. Patience and openness are important this year. In the summer, new career opportunities will arise that should definitely be seized. Health-wise, it's important: Enjoyment is important, but in a healthy measure.\nGemini (21.5.-21.6.)\nGeminis can expect growth in all areas of life. It will be a year full of exciting opportunities and encounters. Professionally, it is important to remain versatile and flexible - skills that a Gemini particularly excels at.

Courage and creativity will be rewarded in all areas of life - whether in love or in professional life. However, this can also be exhausting: Therefore, it is particularly important to have a physical balance.\nVirgo (24.8.-23.9.)\nBe honest: It pays off both in interpersonal relationships and at work. New projects or a complete reorientation may arise - especially in the fall.\nLibra (24.9.-23.10.)\nLibras can also look forward to a harmonious year. Existing relationships gain new familiarity and depth, and professionally, it is worth focusing on creativity. Because then Libras thrive in areas like fashion and media.\nScorpio (24.10.-22.11.)\nScorpios will undergo significant development in 2026.

Who knows what it will bring - perhaps a salary increase?\nSagittarius (23.11.-21.12.)\nSagittarians are optimistic about the new year and infect their surroundings with it.
