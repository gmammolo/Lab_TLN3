  "text": "The upcoming turn of the year is an opportunity for many to reflect on their goals for 2026. A survey by Civey on behalf of Haypp shows that especially young adults in Austria place great importance on New Year's resolutions. Almost half of Austrians plan to exercise more and live more consciously. Particularly the 18 to 29-year-olds place great importance on New Year's resolutions, while only 37 percent of those over 40 and 27 percent of those over 65 consider resolutions important.\nNew Year's Resolutions: Reducing Social Media Consumption as a Major Topic for the Younger Generation The desire for change is particularly evident in the handling of digital habits. Approximately 42 percent of 18 to 29-year-olds have the resolution to spend less time on social media in the coming year. This trend reflects a growing awareness of the consequences of constant availability and distraction through social media. While older generations view such digital habits less critically, the younger generation has recognized this as a central theme of their New Year's resolutions.\nSmoking Loses Importance in New Year's Resolutions The traditional resolution to quit smoking remains significant regardless of age, but is particularly relevant for the 30 to 39-year-olds (18 percent). The younger target group is overall focused on health-related resolutions, such as exercising more and living more consciously (67 and 46 percent of 18 to 29-year-olds, respectively). This also includes spending less money on unnecessary expenses, as over 60 percent of this age group indicate. In summary, the study shows that the younger generation sees the turn of the year as an opportunity for healthier changes, while older age groups wish to spend more time with family and friends.\nNew Year's Resolutions: The Challenge of Implementation and the Pressure of Social Media Despite the resolutions made, implementation is a challenge for all respondents. Long-term successes are rare: almost half of Austrians report maintaining their resolutions either not at all or only for up to a month. Lack of motivation (54 percent) and too high expectations of oneself (41 percent) are often cited as obstacles. Distractions such as social media are relevant for 17 percent of respondents. This is particularly noticeable among the young generation: more than a third (34 percent) of 18 to 29-year-olds state that they do not keep resolutions because of platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and others. This is particularly remarkable, as this target group has resolved to consciously reduce their media consumption in the new year. The allure and attraction of social media obviously pose a major challenge for many young people.\n(Red)\nThis article has been automatically translated, read the original article here .",
