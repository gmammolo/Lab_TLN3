  "text": "Trinity Audioplayer ready...\nARIES (March 21-April 19): Happy New Year! That said, today’s not the best start for the overall buoyant year of 2026. Lots of great opportunity days await. For now, if you need to get something done, tomorrow or next week are better to avoid sub-zero stars.\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20): Today’s a poor day for new beginnings but 2026 overall is a very good year. You could be recognized for your efforts and successes. Don’t let passing financial anxiety undermine optimism for the new year.\nGEMINI (May 21-June 20): A tendency to worry isn’t the same as a need to worry. Today you have a tendency for stress around matters of identity and self-esteem. Could there be a need to be on guard? Probably not but do gut check your situational awareness.\nCANCER (June 21-July 22): If teamwork is productive, stay with it. If it devolves into infighting, wait until tomorrow or next week — above zero stars deliver better odds of above-zero outcomes. A nagging concern should pass.\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22): A friend could be upset, or a group could be succumbing to entropy and fear. Service could define you, even somewhat deify you today. Bring the energy to improve a situation that’s in front of you.\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Poor stars don’t deliver as much light, joy, or inspo, but you still might have a creative trick or two up your sleeve. Excitement could light up your dating sector if you are single, but don’t do a first meetup under below-zero stars.\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Simple satisfactions can be best, today the mood could be all about just that. Ground down into some quiet pleasures after a busy holiday season. If you observe a power struggle setting up, don’t engage.\nSCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Tell your story as long as the audience is appropriate and all is going well. It could be hit or miss today, there are better stars for your sign than in the Universal sky. If something starts to go downhill, table it.\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Financial optimism for 2026 is not misplaced, your financial sectors are on fire and 2026 brings lots of great days with high opportunity. A partner might need some time to decompress or re-orient.\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): You could be a ball of sunshine today, enough to illuminate the darkness in today’s stars. Shine because you can. Shine because your light is uniquely your own. It’s literally why you came, to shine your light.\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): If you feel invisible today, it’s no surprise, despite being filled with talents and abilities. Be patient, your time will come. A fear for someone vulnerable could arise but it should be only a fear.\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Time with friends could be happy and flowing even though the Universal stars are underwater. Relax and enjoy, it wouldn’t be a day to initiate anything significant anyway. Next week brings better odds.\nIF TODAY IS YOUR BIRTHDAY: You could be focused on action for beginning the new year, waiting isn’t likely something you’ll want to do. Vibrant energies will be seeking expression, one way to use this energy constructively will be to begin or rededicate yourself to a fitness regimen and your physical health. In business and career, January’s Universal stars are strong enough for a major new beginning if the rest of the pieces line up. February is another story. You could deal with multiple disruptions to plans, you’ll get through that, but the real risk is falling into depression. Keep your mental game strong so you won’t make moves based in negative thinking. Early March could make you want to fool around and find out, but this is not recommended to say the least. By later March more should start to come together for you. survive the challenges and keep going from there, there are many blessings staging themselves for you for 2026.\nBIRTHDAY STAR: Actor Carlos Gomez was born in New York in 1962.
