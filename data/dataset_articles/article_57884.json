  "text": "TELL CITY - For many, Christmas is a season filled with laughter around the table, familiar traditions, and the comfort of being surrounded by loved ones. But for others, the holiday can be a stark reminder of loneliness, loss, or hardship. Recognizing that reality, local nonprofit Task of Minds opened the VFW doors this Christmas, among others in past years, to offer more than a meal. It offered belonging.\nTask of Minds hosted a Christmas lunch for community members who needed a place to go, a seat at the table, and the warmth of shared company. The event welcomed individuals and families from all walks of life, creating a space where no one had to explain why they were there. They simply were, and that was enough.",
