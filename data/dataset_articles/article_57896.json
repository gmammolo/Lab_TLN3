  "text": "Trenton Reynolds\nThe 2025 sports year was full of amazing events and impressive efforts.\nThere were league titles and individual crowns, section marches and top performances that led to state tournament bids.\nAnd there were memories for athletes and coaches from teams representing Braham, Cambridge Christian, Cambridge-Isanti, North Branch and Rush City that will last a lifetime.\nHere are some of those top memories in the local sports world from 2025.\nNorthern Tier Stars win M-8 girls hockey title\nThe Northern Tier Stars girls hockey team clinched the Mississippi 8 Conference title last season by garnering a 4-1-1 overall record in the conference. While the girls finished 8-15-3 overall and lost to Grand Rapids/Greenway in the Section 7AA quarterfinals, the Stars still made the most of their opportunities a year ago.\nHead coach Joe Fredrickson’s squad ultimately sealed the deal following back-to-back wins over Princeton/Big Lake/Becker at the end of last January. The girls finished in first place ahead of Pine City Area (4-2), Chisago Lakes (3-2-1) and Princeton/Big Lake/Becker (0-6).\nArea wrestlers make a state-ment\nThe Cambridge-Isanti wrestling team came within a whisker of advancing to the Class AAA state team tournament, winning two matches before falling to Elk River in the Section 7AAA championship match.\nAt the individual level, three Bluejacket boys advanced to state in Class AAA as Jacob Henderson won the Section 7AAA title at 215, while Brady Huntley and Wyatt Wald advanced at 107 and 114, respectively.\nThe best individual performance came from Rush City/Braham’s Isabelle Shockman. As a freshman, she advanced to the title match at 118 pounds in the girls state tournament before falling to Caley Graber of Northfield, one of the top female wrestlers in the country.\nNB, C-I gymnasts perform well at state\nA whole array of talented gymnasts from our area competed in the MSHSL’s Class A and Class AA state gymnastics tournaments last winter. North Branch’s Dakota Esget and Ella Dick earned their way to the state competition at Roy Wilkins Auditorium in St. Paul back on Feb. 22. Esget came away with a third-place finish in the all-around format (37.3625) and Dick placed 13th (8.9) on the beam and 34th overall (8.95) on the vault.\nBoth Cambridge-Isanti’s Aubrey Wilson and Zoey Klocksein also made it to state and took part in the all-around and the uneven bars, respectively. Wilson tallied an 11th place finish in the all-around (35.825) and Klocksein grabbed tenth in bars after taking third in the 7AA meet in what was her final action as a Bluejacket gymnast.\nBraham basketball experiences déjà vu\nThe Braham boys and girls basketball teams both experienced a bit of a flashback from a year earlier.\nThe Bomber girls advanced to the Section 5A championship game for the second year in a row, facing Walker-Hackensack-Akeley at St. Cloud State once again.\nUnfortunately, this year the results were the same as last season as Braham lost to the Wolves once again. This loss was especially bitter since it was by just two points — and in overtime.\nThe Braham boys also advanced to the Sub Section 5A East title contest for the second straight season, where the Bombers again lost to top-seeded Upsala.\nCCS basketball teams shine in tournament\nThe Cambridge Christian School girls basketball team won the Tier 2 title bracket of the MCAC league tournament a season ago. The Warriors did so following a close 63-59 win over ninth-seeded St. Cloud back in March. The boys team also clinched a berth in the MCAC Tier 2 championship game, and the Warriors defeated No. 9 St. Cloud — in very similar fashion to the girls — in a tight 68-61 final score on March. 7. Each team capped off their respective 2025 seasons as champions of the Tier 2 bracket.\nLowman keeps it all in the family\nKeagen Lowman was Cambridge-Isanti’s boys nominee for the MSHSL’s Academics, Arts and Athletics Award, as was his mother during her high school days and his older sister back in 2023.\nKeagen Lowman eventually was named the Section 7AA nominee for the award at the state level. Lowman then was the Class AA state winner of the “Triple-A award,” which honors high school seniors throughout the state who have a 3.0 or higher GPA and who participate in league-sponsored athletic and fine arts activities.\nKeagen Lowman joined his sister Ava as Class AA winners at the state level.\nMcCallum shines in senior season\nIsanti native Grace McCallum made the most of her senior year on the University of Utah gymnastics team.\nMcCallum was named as a Women’s Collegiate Gymnastics Association NCAA All-American First Team performer in the all-around, vault, uneven bars and floor exercise, giving her 15 All-American honors in her career.\nShe was named WCGA North Central Region Gymnast of the Year and was one of six finalists for the 2025 AAI Award, which is presented annually to the top senior female gymnast in Division I.\nMcCallum, who won a silver medal in the 2021 Olympics as a member of the United States team, helped lead Utah to its fifth consecutive appearance in the Final Four. The Red Rocks placed fourth in the finals.\nMcCallum also was named Big 12 Conference Gymnast of the Year after earning all-conference first team honors in each discipline — vault, bars, beam and floor exercise — as well as all-around.\nMcCallum won the Big 12 all-around and vault titles at the league tournament and led Utah to the league’s regular-season and tournament titles.\nBoys tennis sees NB and C-I advance to state\nBoth Cambridge-Isanti and North Branch were represented at the boys state tennis tournament.\nThe Vikings’ Wyatt Helberg made the most of his second appearance in the Class A state tournament, finishing fourth in the state.\nHis route was a difficult one as he needed to beat the player who finished fifth in the tournament just to advance to the championship bracket. There he suffered losses to the two top-seeded players in the event.\nMeanwhile C-I came within an eyelash of advancing to state as a team. The Mississippi 8 Conference’s regular-season champs advanced to the Section 7AA championship match against Elk River, where the Bluejackets lost a narrow 4-3 decision.\nBut two seniors, Keagen Lowman and Micah Gustafson, teamed up to win the Section 7AA individual doubles title to advance to state for the second year in a row.\nThere the pair won their first match, then pushed the top-seeded doubles team in the state to a third set before falling, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2.\nC-I, RC softball win league titles\nFor years, Cambridge-Isanti was at the bottom of the Mississippi 8 Conference standings.\nThis year the Bluejackets were at the top.\nC-I finished with a sparkling 11-1 record in M8 action and also posted the program’s first winning season since 2016.\nMeanwhile Rush City also earned the top spot in the Great River Conference’s “large school” division with a 13-2 mark in league play.\nThe Tigers are accustomed to being one of the best teams in the GRC, having won ten conference crowns since 2015.\nBraham softball has year to remember\nThe Braham girls softball team clinched just its second ever Class A state tournament berth last summer and its first in over 40 years. The Bombers, who recorded an impressive 23-5 overall record following the season’s end, roared its way back to the state tournament at Caswell Park in North Mankato by beating West Lutheran in the Section 4A title game. The Bombers ultimately finished fourth in Class A following a 3-2 walkoff win over No. 5 Wabasso in the opening round — in what was the program’s first ever win at the state tournament.\nFrom there, the girls faced off with United South Central, where the Bombers lost by way of a tough 6-0 final before falling 1-0 to No. 7 Bethlehem Academy to seal the top-four finish. Pitcher Alex Rsydam, who recorded her 500th career strikeout last season — capped off her final year as a Bomber with All-State honors.\nArea well represented at state track\nCambridge-Isanti’s boys and girls track and field teams sent multiple individuals from each side to the Class AAA state races last summer. Jackson Ziebarth, a junior at the time, ran in both the 100m and 200m dashes, where he placed second in both events via 10.51 and 21.42 times, respectively. Zierbarth’s older brother, Jay, participated in the discus finals where he placed 18th with a 135-04 throw.\nA junior pole-vaulting duo in Calvin Piescher and Wesley Kennedy each placed second and sixth overall, respectively, prior to the boys’ 4x100m relay team taking 16th in the prelims and the 4x800m group was 12 in 8:18.77. The Bluejackets also had girls’ Abby Kryzer and Aubrey Wilson see action at state, where the pair of pole vaulters earned seventh and 18th place, respectively.\nNot only that, but North Branch’s sophomore Sophia Thorsen, who ran in the 200m dash, ran for a sixth-place finish in 25.46 to qualify for the finals race — where she ran for another sixth-place finish via a 25.08.\nSenior Ella Kuhlman ran for 14th in the 400m prelims. Kuhlman was also a part of the state 4x100 relay group, which also includes senior Dakota Esget, junior Ella Dick, and Thorsen. The unit was 8th in the prelims with a 49.41 qualifying time, before taking sixth in the finals on a 49.28 final time.\nThat wasn’t the only relay team that was present at St. Michael-Albertville High School: The 4x200 relay squad, with senior Sophia Benedict in for Dick, took fifth overall in the prelims before placing sixth in the finals in 1:43.86. Dick ultimately showed out in the pole vault, earning an impressive second-place finish with a 12-03.00 clearing mark. Esget and junior Brooke Giese also participated in the pole vault event, where the duo posted 10-06.00 and 10-00.00 marks, respectively, for ninth and 13th place.\nFreshman Kendra Heintz of Rush City worked her way back to the Class A state track and field championships for the second straight year after another brilliant season with the Tigers. Heintz partook in both the triple jump and long jump events, showcasing her abilities amongst the state’s best. The track star medaled and earned third-place overall in the triple jump by way of a 36-04.50 mark, trailing Dilworth-Glyndon-Felton’s Ellie Sosa and finishing ahead of Redwood Valley’s Kendall Huhnerkoch.\nArea golfers swing for state\nA small chunk of state golfers from our local high schools performed well in the Class A and Class AA state golf tournaments over this past summer. The Class A competition was held at Pebble Creek Golf Club in Becker, while the Class AA meet was hosted at Ridges at Sand Creek Golf Course in Jordan.\nBraham’s senior Jenna Burmaster competed in her fourth career individual state tournament, while North Branch’s senior Ashley Bistodeau was back again in her second state nod. A pair of Viking boys also earned their way to the state’s biggest stage, where freshman Nick Melvin — also his second state berth — and sophomore Carter Magnison both turned some heads in the state pool.\nBurmaster placed and tied for 24th overall via an 88 on the front nine and 90 on the back to total a 178 two-day final tally. It was Burmaster’s best finish and state score of her career, a fitting way to end her notable tenure as a Bomber.\nVikings’ Bistodeau took 31st overall after shooting a combined 170 score via a 92 on the front nine, before improving to a 78 on the back nine. Her finish was ahead of Marshall’s junior Dayton Webskowski (171) and behind Holy Family Catholic’s sophomore Eastyn Cizek (169).\nMelvin, who earned his first state nod as just an eighth-grader in 2024, tied for 70th overall after a combined 164 score — shooting 81 and 83 rounds on the front and back nine. Magnison wasn’t too far behind his fellow teammate, who wound up earning 77th via a 167.\nNB & C-I girls both shine in tennis\nThe Mississippi 8 Conference girls tennis season was a dustup that saw three teams battle for the crown.\nWhen the dust finally settled, there was a three-way tie at the top.\nOne of those teams was Cambridge-Isanti, which has won or shared the title in each of the past three seasons. A second was North Branch, which claimed the first team conference title in that sport in school history.\nBoth schools proved that finish was no fluke.\nNorth Branch had singles players Paulina Rossini and Rebekkah Wurdemann advance to the semifinals of the Section 7AA individual tournament, as did the doubles pair of Maggie Hunter and Charlotte Santjer.\nMeanwhile C-I had two doubles teams — the pairing of Anya Lowman and Allie Troolin, along with sisters Evie and Scarlet Porta — advance to the semifinals in Section 7AAA, where they, too, just missed advancing to state.\nBut the Bluejackets got a bit of revenge, upsetting Blaine in the Section 7AAA team championship to earn the program’s first-ever state berth.\nCCS boys soccer wins MCAC Tier 2 title\nThe Cambridge Christian School boys soccer team won the Minnesota Christian Athletic Conference (MCAC) league state tournament title this past fall as the No. 2 overall seed in the Tier 2 bracket. Head coach John Newton’s Warriors were sent over to the Tier 2 side of things following a 4-1 loss in the opening round to St. Francis, in which St. Francis had won the Tier 1 title last fall.\nBut the first round defeat didn’t seem to phase the Warriors at all, as Cambridge Christian began the opening round of Tier 2 with a lopsided 6-0 shutout win over rival St. Cloud on Friday, Oct. 31. Junior Gavin Estenson recorded himself a hat trick, while sophomore Eli Harper, Drake Weiss and Micah Ward all netted goals. Senior Mason Eklund had four total saves in the win.\nFrom there, the boys moved on to the championship round to face off with Faith Foreston — a team the Warriors had not beaten all year long. But Cambridge Christian ultimately changed that, winning a low-scoring 1-0 game to cement the MCAC title and a 12-3-9 overall record on the season.\nJacobson among top CC runners in state\nThe third time was the charm for Hunter Jacobson.\nThe Cambridge-Isanti senior made his third run in the Class AA state cross country meet one to remember. He earned all-state honors by finishing ninth in the race, making him the first Bluejacket boys cross country runner to medal at state since 1980.\nThat finish capped a stellar senior season for Jacobson in which he won the Mississippi 8 Conference individual title, making him the first conference champion for C-I since 1998. Jacobson’s win in the M8 championship marked the fifth straight race he won over the course of the season.\nMichaelis advances to state in diving\nFor the third year in a row, the Cambridge-Isanti girls swim and dive team advanced a diver to state.\nThis year, that diver was Anika Michaelis, who placed third at the Section 7AA meet.\nThe sophomore, who also placed third in diving at the True Team meet, then placed 25th at the MSHSL Class AA state meet, which was held at the University of Minnesota.",
