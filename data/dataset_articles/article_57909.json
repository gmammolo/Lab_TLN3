  "text": "On December 31, 2025, Indian batter Virat Kohli shared a social media update to mark the arrival of the New Year with his wife, Anushka Sharma. The post was published late Wednesday evening and quickly became one of the most engaged-with updates on Instagram, drawing millions of interactions within a few hours.\nAs one of the most followed athletes globally, Kohli’s personal updates frequently attract significant attention from both the media and the general public. This specific post captured a rare informal moment for the couple away from the cricket field. It highlighted a festive atmosphere as they prepared to move into 2026.\nVirat Kohli’s New Year post with Anushka Sharma takes the internet by storm\nThe viral post featured a photo of Kohli and Anushka in an outdoor setting, where both were seen with temporary face paint or festive face tattoos on their cheeks. Kohli captioned the image, “Stepping into 2026 with the light of my life,” tagging Anushka and adding heart emojis to the message. The designs on their faces were colorful and playful, contributing to the relaxed and carefree vibe of the photograph.\nWithin a short period, the post received a massive volume of likes and comments from fans, celebrities, and fellow cricketers who sent their New Year wishes to the couple. Many social media users commented on the strength of their bond, while others noted that the temporary tattoos were a fun way to welcome the upcoming year. The post stood out as a personal highlight during a period of high-intensity cricket for the batter. Kohli’s trend of sharing such milestones with his followers continues to drive high engagement, as seen with this latest New Year’s Eve update.\nAlso READ: Saeed Ajmal picks top 5 spinners of modern-day cricket\nVijay Hazare Trophy: Final domestic appearance for Virat Kohli\nBeyond the New Year celebrations, Kohli is preparing for his final match in the current Vijay Hazare Trophy for Delhi. His return to the tournament after a 15-year gap has been statistically significant, highlighted by his recent milestone of reaching 16,000 List A runs. He achieved this during his 58th List A century against Andhra Pradesh, becoming only the second Indian after Sachin Tendulkar to do so.\nThis upcoming domestic match is his last scheduled appearance for Delhi before he joins the national squad for the three-match ODI series against New Zealand. The series is set to begin on January 11, and Kohli is using these domestic games to maintain his batting rhythm. His presence in the tournament has drawn large crowds to the venues and increased interest in India’s top one-day competition. After this final fixture, he will transition back to international duties to lead the batting lineup for the first home series of 2026.\nAlso READ: Reason why Shreyas Iyer will miss the upcoming ODI series against New Zealand",
