  "text": "By Carena Liptak ,\n11 hours ago\nRandy Travis got a new wheelchair for Christmas, but it was the details on the back of the chair that made this present extra special.\nThe singer’s new chair was built and designed just for him, and it features three wood-colored crosses embellished on the back of the seat.\nTo a non-country fan, that might seem like a simple expression of faith. But to Travis — and to the fans who know his music — it’s an homage to one of the singer’s most powerful songs.\nThat song is “Three Wooden Crosses,” a song that Travis released as part of his Rise and Shine album in 2002.\nWatch Randy Travis Open His New “Three Wooden Crosses” Wheelchair on Christmas Randy Travis beamed as he saw the new wheelchair, his dog sitting on his lap.\nVideo posted to Travis’ social media also shows clips of the chair being assembled, including hand-painted custom designs on the armrests to go along with the “Three Wooden Crosses” detail on the back.\n“Randy loves his new chair!” text in the video reads.\nWhy Does Randy Travis Use a Wheelchair? Travis has used a chair to get around since a near-fatal stroke he suffered in 2013. That stroke severely limited the singer’s ability to walk, speak and sing. He’s been largely unable to sing or record music since the stroke, but he has remained very active in country music, turning out to support new artists and continuing to spend time with his fans. Read More : Randy Travis + Clay Walker Had a Wheelchair Race + It’s Hilarious\nThese days, Travis is most often seen in his chair, though he does occasionally walk and can speak a little bit.\nWhat Is Randy Travis’ “Three Wooden Crosses” About? “Three Wooden Crosses” is a story song about four passengers involved in a serious bus accident, in which three out of the four die (resulting in “ three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway “).\nThe passengers involved are a farmer, a teacher, a sex worker and a preacher, though it’s not revealed until the end of the song which of the four survived.\nSubscribe to Taste of Country on Youtube\nIn the final verse, a preacher holds up a blood-stained Bible that was involved in the crash as he’s telling the story to his congregation. But in a plot twist, it’s revealed that the preacher’s mother — the sex worker — gave it to him after it was given to her by the preacher in the accident, and it was she who was the one that survived.\n“Three Wooden Crosses” was a No. 1 hit for Travis after he released it in 2002.\nIn light of Travis’ real-life medical ordeal, the story of near-death and redemption is one that hits even closer to home. Keep reading for a list of other country stars who are also living with serious medical conditions.\n14 Country Stars Who Are Living With Serious Health Conditions Carly Pearce, Mark Chesnutt and Colt Ford have all made headlines recently for serious medical problems, but they're not the only country stars living with chronic illness. Gallery Credit: Sterling Whitaker Terry Wyatt, Getty Images Carly Pearce: Pericarditis Carly Pearce is just 34 years old, but she revealed in May 2024 that she'd been diagnosed with a heart condition called pericarditis. The condition is an inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart, and Pearce says she has to watch her heart rate on stage as a result— especially during one particular song . Terry Wyatt, Getty Images Colt Ford: Heart Problems, Cancer + Autoimmune Disease Colt Ford has faced several different health problems in recent years, including eye cancer and an autoimmune disease called myasthenia gravis. His ongoing health battles came to a head in April 2024, when he suffered a near-fatal heart attack after a show in Arizona. The pioneering country rapper later revealed he had flatlined twice , but doctors were able to revive him. Jason Kempin, Getty Images Ashley Cooke: Brugada Syndrome Ashley Cooke has been diagnosed with Brugada syndrome, which is a heart ailment that can cause an increased risk of irregular heart rhythms beginning in the lower chambers of the heart. It can also cause fainting, as well as sudden cardiac arrest. Rick Diamond, Getty Images Mark Chesnutt: Heart Problems Mark Chesnutt has canceled shows several times in recent years over unspecified health problems, but the situation turned far more serious in June 2024. The '90s country traditionalist suffered a heart issue that led to emergency quadruple bypass surgery .\nHe has since made a full recovery, and he's back touring on his 2025 Redemption Tour. Christopher Polk, Getty Images Shania Twain: Lyme Disease Shania Twain disappeared from the limelight for a number of years, and fans had no idea she was fighting a long-term health battle. She contracted Lyme disease in 2003 after a tick bite, and Twain battled vocal problems including dysphonia for years, completely losing her voice at one point. She finally underwent open-throat surgery, and while her voice has not returned to what it was before, she has been able to resume recording and performing. David A. Smith, Getty Images Randy Travis: Aphasia Randy Travis has been mostly unable to work in music since a stroke in 2013 took away most of his ability to speak and sing. He has made a number of public appearances and remains a beloved figure, but so far, his hope of recovering enough to return to singing has not materialized. However, Travis did release a new single titled \" Where That Came From \" in May 2024, with the assistance of AI. Fans and industry friends have mostly voiced support. Rick Diamond, Getty Images Alan Jackson: Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Alan Jackson revealed in 2021 that he had been living with a degenerative nerve condition for more than 10 years. His diagnosis? Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which causes nerve damage in the body, primarily in the arms and legs.\nThe country icon has subsequently grown unstable on stage, and he stepped away from touring in 2025, though he shared plans for one final all-star show in Nashville in 2026. Matt Winkelmeyer, Getty Images Willie Nelson: Emphysema Willie Nelson has struggled with breathing issues for years, including emphysema. His breathing challenges have become so bad that he even gave up smoking marijuana in 2019, though he still uses edibles. Despite that, the 91-year-old country legend continues to record new music and perform, canceling shows here and there as necessary. Mike Coppola, Getty Images Clay Walker: Multiple Sclerosis Clay Walker has been living with multiple sclerosis since 1996, and wow, has he ever proven his doctors wrong. He was initially told he'd be in a wheelchair by 2000 and dead by 2004 , but nearly 30 years later he's still going strong. He formed Band Against MS in 2003 to encourage fundraising and education about the illness. Derek White, Getty Images John Driskell Hopkins: ALS Zac Brown Band member John Driskell Hopkins revealed his ALS diagnosis in May 2022. Also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease, ALS can cause weakness in the legs and feet, problems with coordination, slurred speech and much more. It is debilitating and fatal over time. Hopkins and his wife Jennifer have launched a foundation called Hop on a Cure , which raises funds to end ALS, and for now, he remains active with ZBB. Ethan Miller, Getty Images Trace Adkins: Heart Problems Trace Adkins' second wife famously shot him in the heart during an argument over his drinking, and though he survived after open heart surgery, the country star still has to have regular heart checkups as a result of the damage the bullet inflicted. Terry Wyatt, Getty Images Eric Paslay: Diabetes Eric Paslay has been living with Type 1 diabetes since he was 10, but he doesn't let it slow him down. He maintains an active schedule as a performer and a songwriter. Larry Busacca, Getty Images RaeLynn: Diabetes RaeLynn also lives with Type 1 diabetes, and like Paslay, she not only thrives, but she also routinely makes appearance for fundraising and awareness on the topic. Rodin Eckenroth, Getty Images Kris Kristofferson: Lyme Disease Kris Kristofferson suffered memory loss for years due to what was believed to be either Alzheimer's or dementia, but the country icon made what some call a \"miracle recovery\" after doctors determined that he was being treated for the wrong ailment. Kristofferson actually lived with Lyme disease , and once he began receiving the right treatments, he started to improve dramatically. Kristofferson died on Sept. 28, 2024 at the age of 88, but there's nothing to indicate his Lyme disease was a contributing factor.",
