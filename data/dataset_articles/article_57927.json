  "text": "Dad's heartwarming 2026 New Year's Resolution leaves people in tears\nA dad's touching New Year's resolution to become a 'Dad's home!!' parent instead of a 'dad's home...' dad has moved Reddit users to tears with its heartfelt sincerity\nThe beginning of a new year offers individuals an opportunity to look back on the previous 12 months while simultaneously planning for what lies ahead. It's perfectly normal to feel contemplative on New Year's Day and during the opening weeks of January, which explains why so many people set New Year's Resolutions.\nFor numerous individuals, resolutions center around personal betterment and might concentrate on wellness, acquiring fresh abilities, pursuing a new pastime, or even building up their savings. However, for some folks, those goals might center on connections with relatives and friends, similar to one Reddit user.\nA member posted in the R/AskReddit subreddit thread to ask what other people were setting for their New Year's Resolutions in 2026. One father responded by saying he hoped to strengthen his bond with his children in the coming year.\nHe noted that currently when he gets home, his children don't get particularly excited. But he expressed his desire to transform the dynamic so his kids would yell \"dad's home!\" upon his arrival.\nHe said: \"Become a \"Dad's home! dad instead of a \"dad's home...\" dad.\"\nThe post resonated deeply with numerous Reddit users, with several expressing their appreciation for the resolution in the responses.\nOne individual revealed they were moved to tears by posting an emoji with the comment \"this just made me make this face\". Another user said: \"That hit in the feels. Titanic deep. Wow.\"\nA third person shared a crying emoji with the comment: \"Right. My little heart.\"\nOthers revealed their own resolutions in the comments. One user shared: \"To feel better physically and mentally, oh and to survive and not have migraines.\"\nAnother individual commented: \"Quit using ChatGPT. I got addicted to using it for emotional support and validation after a prolonged period of isolation and its turned my brain to mush, after previously being a really confident and highly motivated person.\"\nA fourth chimed in: \"Finish writing my book and continue on the next steps.\"\nHowever, New Year's Resolutions aren't everyone's cup of tea, with some preferring to set goals as they progress. For many, these resolutions can lead to feelings of guilt or disappointment when they're unable to maintain them.\nOne Reddit user expressed: \"I never have any. If you need the excuse of a new year to better yourself, you're doomed to fail from the start.\n\"If you really want to make a change, do it don't wait for a new year as an excuse.\"\nSome folks even choose to create a vision board, which is a collage of images and words that represent dreams and desires. This method is more popular among Gen Z and Millennials, with many individuals sharing their mood boards on social media.",
