  "text": "The Minister of Internal Affairs, Catalin Predoiu, showed that the investments of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in recent years have led to the most advanced equipment of the ministry ever, and these represent investments in public safety.\n\"The investment is part of a program under which 78 objectives worth a total of 183 million euros were received during the period 2023-2025. These investments are intended for public order and safety structures - Police, Gendarmerie, Border and Immigration\", declared Predoiu, present at the inauguration of the new headquarters of Bucharest Police Department 9.\nHe said that other police station headquarters or those intended for other arms and structures will be inaugurated shortly, actions that are part of an important investment program carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs with the World Bank.\n\"For the Romanian Police, 41 objectives were received, with a total value of approximately 74.6 million euros. In other words, these investments are logistical, but ultimately they are investments in public safety, in the safety of citizens and communities. The investments made are evidence of the MIA's policies of improving and modernizing the equipment available to colleagues from all branches,\" said Predoiu.\nThe Minister of Interior stated that in recent years, the Ministry of Internal Affairs has invested in headquarters, operational centers, laboratories, drones, airplanes, ships, helicopters, special vehicles of various types and for all weapons, drug-testing scanners, physical protection means in interventions, body cams, software and digital infrastructure, consolidations, arrangements, reconstructions have been made and the standards of the equipment have been raised.\n\"These investments are direct investments in the safety of the citizen, the community and the homeland. At the same time, a building, an endowment, no matter how modern, does not solve anything by its simple materialization - any building, any endowment, like a law, represents an instrument. The way in which these instruments are used marks the difference, the professional culture with which they are operated makes the difference, and people's expectations are clear and legitimate,\" Predoiu also declared.\nHe pointed out that this new headquarters of Section 9 was built after the demolition of the old building, with a total cost of 46 million RON, and during the execution, measures were applied for environmental and social impact according to World Bank requirements.\nThe investment in the headquarters of Police Station 9 is carried out by the General Inspectorate of the Romanian Police within the \"Improving Resilience and Emergency Response\" Project, financed by the Loan Agreement between Romania and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, signed in Bucharest on July 10, 2019 and ratified by Law no. 89/2020.",
