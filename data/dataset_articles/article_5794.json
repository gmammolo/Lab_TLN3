  "text": "Halifax judge moved by 'profound human decency' shown by all involved in Somali refugee's sentencing for knife attack\nSentence of six months less a day allows Hassan Abdi Jama, who has cognitive and physical challenges, to appeal removal from Canada\nSentencing hearings seem to reveal both the worst and the best in humanity, a Nova Scotia Supreme Court judge said in Halifax.\n“We see some horrible and horrific things that people are capable of doing,” Justice Jamie Campbell said Wednesday at Hasson Abdi Jama’s sentencing for attacking a support worker with a knife at his Halifax apartment.\n“But sometimes we see profound human decency, and I’ve seen that here.”\nJama, 34, is a Somali national who came to Canada as a United Nations charter refugee in 2019 and has permanent resident status. He fled Somalia after someone tried to kill him by shooting him in the head, leaving him with cognitive and physical challenges.\nHe stood trial in Supreme Court last fall on charges of attempted murder and forcible confinement from an April 12, 2024, incident with a mental health support worker who had gone to his Herring Cove Road residence to drop off some groceries.\nThe woman testified Jama held a large kitchen knife to her throat, threatened to kill her and demanded that he be taken back to Somalia.\nThere was a struggle by the door and she was able to get out of the apartment, ran to a neighbouring residence and called 911. Jama was arrested in his apartment.\nThe woman sustained superficial cuts to her hands while protecting herself from the knife.\nA jury found Jama not guilty as charged but guilty of the lesser offence of assault causing bodily harm.\nBecause of the conviction for a serious offence, Jama is considered inadmissible to Canada and could lose his permanent resident status and be deported. A sentence of six months or longer would have meant he could not appeal his removal.\nAfter considering Jama’s unique circumstances, prosecutors Sean McCarroll and Jeremy Ryant recommended a sentence of six months less a day, deemed served by the 657 days Jama spent on remand.\nJama represented himself at trial, with lawyer Jennifer MacDonald acting as an amicus curiae, or friend of the court.\nThe defendant did not make any submissions at sentencing, but MacDonald told the court she supported the Crown’s position, which she described as fair.\nThiago Buchert, an immigration lawyer with the Halifax Refugee Clinic, was in court Wednesday, prepared to take Jama to a hotel upon his release and help provide him with support services in the community.\nA member of the local Somali community who has attended many of Jama’s court appearances was also present.\nMcCarroll, in the Crown’s submissions, said the seriousness of Jama’s crime cannot be understated.\n“He is being sentenced for an unprovoked attack committed upon a care worker,” the prosecutor said. “While (her) physical injuries were not severe, the emotional wounds caused by his acts are extremely serious.”\nIn a victim impact statement, the woman said she felt terrified during the indicent and truly believed she would be seriously harmed.\n“This experience has stayed with me long after the situation was over,” she wrote. “I am a wife and I am a mother of two beautiful children, and the thought of possibly not making it home to them that day has caused me significant emotional distress.\n“Although I understand that (Jama) has mental health challenges, the impact on me and my family has still been very real.”\nShe said she fears for other support workers who will care for Jama in the future.\n“I know firsthand how dangerous the situation can become when the crisis escalates,” she said. “I worry for their safety, for their families and for the possibility that someone else may not be as fortunate as I was.\n“All I ask is that this situation be taken seriously so that proper safety measures and supports are put in place. No one should have to feel the fear I felt or face the possibility of never returning home to their children because of preventable risks.”\nMcCarroll said the Crown kept the victim’s comments front of mind as it prepared for sentencing.\n“Hassan has no prior criminal record, and there are significant cognitive issues at play which reduce his moral blameworthiness,” he said. “That being said, protection of the public is a fundamental principle of sentencing.”\nMcCarroll said that with the “invaluable assistance” of MacDonald, the refugee clinic had stepped up to provide supports that will address the Crown’s concerns.\n“The success of this plan largely depends upon Hassan and his willingness to engage in it,” the Crown attorney said.\n“It’s clear to the Crown that the principles and purposes of sentencing cannot be advanced any further by continuing to leave Hassan in custody. . . . The issues that need to be addressed can only be done in the community, from the Crown’s perspective. We are hopeful that with the assistance of the Halifax Refugee Clinic, he will receive those necessary supports.”\nThe judge said the sentencing was taking place “at a time when the eyes of the world are on Minnesota and the Somali community (there).”\n“We have come to the end of a very long and difficult process,” Campbell said. “And throughout it, I have been moved by the professionalism, the patience and decency of the people involved.”\nHe expressed gratitude to the prosecutors for handling the matter with dignity and decency and said MacDonald “has worked tirelessly to make sure that Hassan received fair treatment throughout. She has truly been a ‘friend of the court.'”\nThe judge also recognized the graciousness of the Somali interpreter, sheriffs at the courthouse who offered to find clothes for Jama prior to his release on a bitter cold day, and members of the Somali community who showed up to help their fellow countryman.\n“Even when that help was refused, they kept coming back,” Campbell said. “That’s what good, decent people do.”\nHe praised the Halifax Refugee Clinic for its involvement.\n“We’re fortunate to live in a community that has an organization like that,” he said. “They are offering what has been described as wraparound services. . . . Perhaps wraparound is the right word to use, because it feels like an embrace by the community.”\nCampbell said Canada’s justice system, “like all human creations, is imperfect. Perhaps its distinguishing feature is that it never gives up trying to be perfect. Some people might say that’s foolish, but it’s that continued attempt to be perfect that makes it what it is.”\nEvery criminal sentencing involves a tension between conduct and context, he said.\n“Each one keeps the other in check.\n“The conduct in this case was undoubtedly serious. The jury found that (the victim) was essentially attacked by Hassan. As she has pointed out, that was a terrifying experience. . . . It was an unprovoked attack and (she) did nothing to cause it to happen.\n“It’s important, as well, to keep the context in mind. Hassan clearly has cognitive issues. . . . He left Somalia because people were trying to kill him.\n“He arrived in a country with a very different culture and a very different climate. Adapting to that is a challenge at the best of times, but given the challenges that he has had, it has proven particularly difficult.\n“So a sentence must balance that context and conduct.”\nJama has already spent far more time in custody than he would have in normal circumstances, the judge explained.\n“My concern is that if a sentence is imposed that results in his being removed from Canada, it would . . . have catastrophic consequences for him,” Campbell said. “It would be a form of punishment well beyond the 657 days that he has been in jail.\n“It would be inappropriate for me, however, to impose a sentence that takes into account immigration consequences but fails to reflect the case law with regard to sentences of this kind. Counsel have provided me with a number of cases that confirm that assaults of this nature will attract a sentence in the range of six months. That is especially the case given that Mr. Jama has no criminal record and deals with cognitive and physical limitations.\n“I have no hesitation whatsoever in imposing the sentence that has been recommended. That would be six months less one day, deemed served by his period of pre-trial incarceration.”\nThe judge also ordered Jama to provide a sample of his DNA for a national databank and prohibited him from having firearms for 10 years.",
