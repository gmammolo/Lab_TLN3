  "text": "Business & Tech\nSiena Lakes Offers Impressive Amenities, Predictable Finances, and Lasting Value\nSiena Lakes residents Chris and John Lehman love having a carefree lifestyle and access to a range of amenities, like an outdoor pool\nWhen Chris and John Lehman started exploring their senior living options, they were looking for a community that offered a vibrant, worry-free lifestyle and long-term value.\nThey found exactly what they were searching for at Siena Lakes, an Erickson Senior Living community in Naples, Fla.\n\"Siena Lakes' pricing structure features predictable costs that provide both peace of mind and access to an array of amenities and activities,\" says Financial Analyst Elyssa Emmett. \"We are committed to offering an engaging lifestyle as well as exceptional value.\"\nFind out what's happening in Fort Myersfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nPredictable expenses\nChris and John were drawn to Siena Lakes' monthly service package, which bundles the costs of utilities, home maintenance and repair, a meal plan at on-site restaurants, trash and recycling collection, scheduled shuttle service, professional landscaping, and more into one predictable bill.\nFind out what's happening in Fort Myersfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\n\"I like that you don't have to pay separately for all these different things,\" says John. \"Plus, they take care of everything.\"\nJohn refers to the professional General Services team, which handles all maintenance requests in a timely manner. As a result, residents no longer spend time researching, comparing, and waiting for local services.\nThe couple especially appreciates that delicious, made-to-order meals prepared by expert chefs are included in the package.\n\"We love Chianti's,\" one of five restaurants located right on campus. \"We eat there all the time because we enjoy the ambiance and the food.\"\nPeace of mind\nResidents' financial stability is further strengthened by Siena Lakes' industry-leading, 80% refundable entrance fee*--the heart of the community's pricing structure. The entrance fee, collected as part of the residency process, will go back to you or your beneficiaries if or when you leave the community.\n\"I'm impressed with the Erickson business model,\" says John. \"They offer a good value.\"\nA vibrant lifestyle\nWithout the stress and hassle of home maintenance, residents have more time to pursue their hobbies and interests--especially since access to the community's amenities is also included in the monthly service package.\nSiena Lakes boasts an expansive fitness center, outdoor pool, library, salon, dog park, bocce courts, putting green, and more.\nWhen they're not enjoying time in their two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath home with a den, lanai, and patio, the Lehmans can be found by the pool. In fact, John tries to swim every day.\nThe couple also plays bocce and table tennis and attends lectures on campus offered by Florida Gulf Coast University.\n\"I like shooting pool on the pool table, and I've played pickleball a few times too,\" adds John. \"There are so many activities here that I just can't fit them all in!\"\nEverything's connected\nBest of all, everything is very convenient.\n\"We like that you don't have to go outside to get to the restaurants, meeting rooms, or even the fitness center. Everything is connected--you can just walk through the corridors,\" explains Chris. \"If it's raining or really hot, you don't have to walk outside.\"\nAnd although they've chosen to keep their off-campus physician, the couple likes having access to the on-site medical center, which they can visit for flu shots, tests, and screenings.\nAdded value\nThe community provides additional value by continuously reinvesting in services, amenities, and residence buildings.\n\"We want Siena Lakes to be a fantastic place to live--now and in the future,\" says Emmett. \"Our well-thought-out budget allows for flexibility so that we can adjust to the needs and wants of residents. We make sure they have what they need to live a vibrant, carefree life.\"\nThe right move\nFor Chris and John, moving to Siena Lakes has brought them value, peace of mind, new friendships, and more time to make the most\nof retirement.\n\"There's a strong feeling of camaraderie at Siena Lakes. The residents and staff here are so friendly,\" says Chris. \"Even on your first visit, you'll get a warm welcome. Everyone is so nice!\"\nWho can put a price on that?
