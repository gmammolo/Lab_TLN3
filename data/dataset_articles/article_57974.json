  "text": "Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone just had their best New Year’s Eve in New York. The couple has been celebrating the grand success of Dhurandhar, which has crossed 1,000 crores worldwide. And now they have found a way to make the most of their New Year celebrations, meeting chef Vikas Khanna in New York at his restaurant, Bungalow.\nVikas Khanna shared a reel on social media featuring him alongside the Bollywood couple. Sharing the video, he merged it with the title track of Dhurandhar, and also stated that this was all to celebrate Ranveer Singh’s latest releases and the success that followed with the film’s release. Alongside, he also taught the couple to make fresh modaks. Deepika Padukone made her first modaks, and in the video, we can see a close-up of the modaks they made together.\nSharing the reel, the chef wrote, “This has to be the most blessed end to 2025 — a new beginning in honor of India. Team Bungalow had the privilege of celebrating with Ranveer & Deepika her first modak. All our guests walking into Bungalow today will enjoy pomegranate & cardamom modaks for an auspicious beginning to 2026. Celebrating DHURANDHAR — standing taller than any film in the world.” He further added, “Standing in front of my parents wedding picture and creating modaks from the molds I just got from Siddhivinayak Temple…..I’m truly humbled.”",
