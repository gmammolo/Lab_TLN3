He commended the community for their responsible behaviour, which contributed to the smooth proceedings of the night.\nIn his tweet, Sajjanar stated, \"Thank you Hyderabad - a New Year without accidents! The festivities concluded peacefully, and there were no untoward incidents. Rigorous checks on drunk driving were enforced across the city, and the strong action taken by police proved effective. The increased awareness among the public has led to this success. Congratulations to the citizens for their responsible conduct, voluntarily cooperating by not driving under the influence. Hyderabad has once again proven itself to be a safe city. The celebrations showcased that joyous events can occur without risks. This is an excellent example of coordination between the police department and the public. Let us continue to work together to make Hyderabad an even safer, global city. The lesson from Hyderabad is clear: celebrations can take place, but without the risks!\"\nThe efforts of the police and the cooperation of citizens resulted in a successful New Year's celebration in Hyderabad, setting a positive precedent for future events.",
