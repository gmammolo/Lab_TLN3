C U T on Unsplash\n“. . .although Darden did okay, because they’re largely chicken. And chicken is in large supply.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of DRI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.
