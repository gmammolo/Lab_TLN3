  "text": "By Allie McKibben ,\n1 hours ago\nFORT WAYNE, Ind. (WANE) – A New Years Eve tradition that almost did not happen, but Fort Wayne Komets fans are glad it did.\nThe New Years Eve game against the Bloomington Bison was a sellout, packing 10,006 seats at the Memorial Coliseum. But fans knew they could have all been empty if the ECHL and the Professional Hockey Players’ Association had not reached an official agreement on Tuesday.\nKomets players started their strike on Friday, postponing three Komets games. The new deal significantly increases player compensation, improves health and safety, and delivers on new initiatives to respond to players’ needs.\nWhile the Komets will not be starting 2026 with the win, as the Bloomington Bison won the match four to three, their fans were happy to keep their New Year’s Eve tradition alive and well.\n“It wouldn’t be the same without them playing,” said 10-year-old Komets fan Lillian Osborn.\n“I’ve been looking forward to coming to this all year,” said Komets fan Sarah Galbreath. “It’s such a great time watching them being surrounded by lots of other families, just spending time together and we love the excitement.”\nThe three postponed games have yet to be rescheduled.\nCopyright 2026 Nexstar Media, Inc.
