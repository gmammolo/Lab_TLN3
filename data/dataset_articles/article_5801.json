  "text": "Montana Highway Patrol trooper honored after saving child\nMALTA, Mont. — A Montana Highway Patrol trooper is being recognized for decisive action that saved the life of a young child following a serious two-vehicle crash in Blaine County in October 2025.\nTrooper Brett Westford was patrolling in the area when he came upon the aftermath of the collision. He immediately requested additional resources and began checking on the occupants involved in the crash. Two women in one vehicle were found disabled in the middle of the roadway.\nA second vehicle was located off the highway, where Trooper Westford discovered a woman standing over an unresponsive small child. Unable to locate a pulse, Westford repositioned the child’s airway and the child began breathing again.\nWestford remained with the child, monitoring the airway until emergency medical services arrived. He also worked to comfort the child’s distraught mother while awaiting additional responders.\nAuthorities say the child survived the injuries sustained in the crash due to Trooper Westford’s swift actions and life-saving measures at the scene.\nOn Tuesday, Trooper Westford met with the child’s mother, who presented him with a traditional star quilt as a symbol of gratitude for his professionalism and heroism.\nTrooper Westford joined the Montana Highway Patrol in 2024 and is stationed in Malta.",
