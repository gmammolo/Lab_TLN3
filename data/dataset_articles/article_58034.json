  "text": "Only a week ago, Bron Walker was making the dress that won her the 2026 Fashion on the Fields at the St Marys races.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nThe clothesmaker said she had \"always loved dressing up\" in pieces she designed.\n\"I didn't expect a win but I'm exceptionally pleased. I bought the fabric in Vancouver and made it last week,\" Ms Walker said.\nMs Walker was no stranger to success at Fashions on the Field events and said she'd been competing in various events for 20 years.\n\"I just love getting dressed up,\" she said.\n\"You're never too old to get involved with fashion.\"\nBut the glitz and glamour wasn't all for the adults at the New Year's Day race day.\nIn the 11-15-year-old section, Layla Woods from Fingal won with flying colours and said the competition had become a \"tradition\" for her.\n\"Between me and my mum we work together to create an outfit,\" Layla said.\n\"I enjoy dressing up.\"\nWinner in the under-10s section was Lola Goodyer from St Helens who said she liked \"to get lollies\".\n\"I did it when I was really little - I like to dress up and get lollies,\" she said.\nLola also thanked the event organisers and hoped the tradition would continue well into the future.\nIn the boys 0-15 section, Layla's cousin Levi Woods from Fingal came up with his outfit and said his favourite part was the horse badge.\nThis year's event attracted more than 1500 people and committee member Craig Woods said he was glad to see perfect weather after flooding in previous years.\nHe said it was great to see people lapping up the atmosphere and starting their 2026 off well.\n\"Some people come here from the mainland and all across the state,\" Mr Woods said.",
