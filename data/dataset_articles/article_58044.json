He went on to graduate from Dartmouth College in 2000, where he earned a B.A. in Economics and studied abroad at the University Autónoma de Madrid. He then graduated from Chicago-Kent College of Law in 2006 and later worked in the financial services sector, where he earned his Certified Financial Planner (CFP ®️) designation in 2011. A few years later, Dara transitioned into the creative arts, including writing and filmmaking, and since then he has written, directed, produced, and edited two award-winning feature-length documentary films (“Breaking the Silence” and “Two Weeks with Dada”) and published two books (“Breaking the Silence” and “Mirror for the Mind”). Dara also runs an independent general consulting business where he assists select individuals and companies to discover creative solutions to their most pressing issues. Being a staunch mental health advocate as well, Dara consulted for a psychosis clinic at a renowned Chicago hospital, designing and building out their robust peer support program. Dara is now dipping his toes into screenwriting for both film and television, as well as public speaking and mentoring. Incidentally, he hosted his own independent radio show, “The Big Picture Radio Show,” in Chicago in 2014.\nDara Sanandaji\nGolden Rule Media, LLC\n+1 312-870-0127\nemail us here\nVisit us on social media:\nLinkedIn\nInstagram\nFacebook\nTikTok\nX\n“Mirror for the Mind” Introduction Video\nLegal Disclaimer:\nEIN Presswire provides this news content “as is” without warranty of any kind.
