  "text": "Hyderabad Rings in 2026 with Zero Accidents Amid Strict Police Vigil\nHyderabad: The City of Pearls welcomed the New Year 2026 on a remarkably peaceful note, setting a new benchmark for public safety. In a significant achievement for the city administration, no major accidents or serious drunk driving incidents were reported during the celebrations, a feat officials attribute to robust police planning and heightened public awareness.\nPreparations for a safe New Year’s Eve began as early as December 24, 2025. The Hyderabad Police implemented a \"zero tolerance\" policy against rash driving and established over 100 drunk and drive checkpoints across the city. To further discourage intoxicated driving, free shuttle services were introduced in high-traffic zones like Cyberabad, while strict warnings were issued to pubs, hotels, and cab aggregators regarding compliance.\nHyderabad Police Commissioner V.C. Sajjanar confirmed the success of these measures on January 1. \"Not a single untoward incident occurred. This was not a coincidence but the result of strict surveillance combined with public support,\" he stated.\nCommissioner Sajjanar also lauded the citizens' responsible behavior with a touch of local flair. \"Awareness worked, and responsibility won. Your cooperation made the difference. *Hyderabad ne dikhaya—celebration ho sakta, bina risk ke. Hamesha yaad rakho—nasha aur steering ek saath nai* (Hyderabad showed that celebrations can happen without risk. Always remember—intoxication and steering don't go together),\" he remarked.\nOfficials noted that the registration of over 800 drunk driving cases during special drives in December served as a strong deterrent. This accident-free transition into 2026 is being viewed as a model for future large-scale events, reinforcing Hyderabad's reputation as a safe metropolis.\nPreparations for a safe New Year’s Eve began as early as December 24, 2025.
