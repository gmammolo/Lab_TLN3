  "text": "Larson Announces $500,000 in New Federal Funding to Support Survivors and Prevent Gun Violence in the Greater Hartford Area\nHartford, CT – Yesterday, Rep. John B. Larson (CT-01) announced $500,000 in new federal funding for Mothers United Against Violence’s Victim Impact Project, to continue their efforts to prevent gun violence and support survivors in the Greater Hartford area.\nMothers United Against Violence works hand-in-hand with local law enforcement to build trust and keep communities same, while also providing supportive services to victims and families impacted by gun violence.\nView the full press conference here.\n“I am proud to continue to work with Mothers United Against Violence to protect our communities from gun violence,” said Larson. “I commend their incredible work and all they have done to build trust between community members and our local law enforcement. The $500,000 in federal funding we announced today will support their work to prevent violence before it happens while providing families of victims and survivors with the support they need to heal. The entire Connecticut delegation, led by Rosa DeLauro on the House Appropriations Committee, will continue to deliver the critical funding groups like Mothers United needs to keep our children safe and end the horrific gun violence epidemic plaguing our nation.”\n“We are grateful for the support of Congressman Larson and Congresswoman DeLauro for continuing to recognize the work of the Mothers United Against Violence, a community organization. The work is ongoing as our community continues to grapple with mental health and acts of violence and trauma on a day-to-day basis,” said Deborah Davis, Mothers United Against Violence Vice President of Development and Director of Program Management.\nLarson secured this new funding as part of a government funding package that passed the House earlier this month and was signed into law last Friday. This year’s Community Project Funding builds on $1.3 million Larson previouslysecured in Congress for the Victim Impact Project, totaling $1.8 million in federal funding over the last five years.\nIn Congress, Rep. Larson continues to champion common-sense reforms to prevent gun violence, including universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, and Ethan’s Law, to establish federal safe firearm storage standards.\nPhotos from yesterday’s funding announcement are available HERE",
