  "text": "Happy New Year!\nJan 1, 2026\nNew Year’s resolutions are often built on the idea of reinvention. But to come at it from a mental health-forward perspective, the trick may be to navigate the year with more intention, and a lot more self-compassion.\nSo how do you make resolutions that keep your mental health in mind? Let’s start with a different approach to goal-setting.\nExample – say you’re looking into mindfulness: “I’ll meditate for an hour every day” might sound aspirational, but “I’ll take five minutes for deep breaths when I’m stressed” could be more sustainable.\nIt’s also important to note that your needs and circumstances will shift throughout the year, and your resolutions should too. Give yourself permission to adjust or even drop goals that no longer serve you.\nWith any goal you set for yourself, try to:\n1. Celebrate the small wins.\n2. Acknowledge the moments when you’re showing up for yourself.\nMaybe it’s resisting the urge to scroll on your phone before bed or taking five minutes to pause and check in with your feelings. These little victories are the foundation of a more sustainable 2026.\nSo, no, you don’t need to reinvent yourself this year. Just resolve to be real, to take things one step at a time, and to accept that it’s okay to have hard days, and to actually do what’s in your best interest. And reach out (and accept) support when you need it.\nThis New Year, you don’t need to be “brand new.” Just keep showing up. Keep being here. That’s already something incredible.\nBecause you are #SomeonesSomeone.",
