  "text": "It is very understandable that folks from all over want to live, if even part time, in Santa Fe. Having lived here for 34 years now, the beautiful environment, the rich culture and the friendliness of the people are pretty much unparalleled. What I do not understand is folks who are capable of paying a million dollars to own a home here being unwilling to pay a relatively small extra fee for that privilege.\nEspecially when that fee is being used to allow those who patrol our streets, serve us in restaurants and teach our children to, possibly, own a piece of this beautiful city as well. Seventy-three percent of the voters approved that fee. The people who already live here — perhaps for generations — have all mostly agreed that those who are more fortunate should help those who are less so. It seems so little to ask. In my opinion, anyone capable of paying a million dollars for a home in Santa Fe but unwilling to contribute to the core of the city — the hardworking locals — doesn’t understand our city and perhaps should live somewhere else.\nSusan Coulter",
