  "text": "By News 12 Staff ,\n2 hours ago\nJust because the holiday season is wrapping up, it doesn't mean the winter fun has to end.\nThe \"Wonderland of Ice\" on Glenwood Avenue in Bridgeport is hosting open ice skating sessions.\nThe rink is the official practice facility of the Bridgeport Islanders.\nIt's also host to a handful of community youth programs.\n\"Kids have off from school and so do a lot of the parents. They're playing, or some are playing hooky. But they come here and they have a great time. It's good cardiovascular. It's fun for everyone, the whole family. Plus, we have refreshments,\" says Russ Fetcho, skateguard of \"Wonderland of Ice.\" \"Like I said, just a lot of fun. Got to put your skates on. Get out there.\"\nVisitors who mention News 12 Connecticut will receive $5 off their skating session through Jan. 4.",
