Every guy on the gay hook-up apps (like Grindr and Scruff) seems to be 21 and allergic to shirts. Should I even bother anymore? The apps make me feel like I’m way past my prime.\nHelp!\nLonely Larry\nDear Larry,\nGrindr is like a buffet—you just have to know where to find the best bites. Sure, there are twinks chasing protein shakes, but there are also silver foxes looking for thick, juicy meats. Yes, you’ll find toothless meth addicts, but you’ll also find established professionals looking for someone who actually owns furniture.\nIf you like the apps, don’t delete them. Change your profile to read “age and experience appreciated.” That’s code for “I have good lighting and better credit.” If you’re done with the apps, put yourself out there more. Step outside your comfort zone and look for ways to meet new people. You can also simply take a break from dating. Focus on yourself, reconnect with friends and enjoy life!\nRuthie’s Social Calendar Ruthie’s January Social Calendar\nJanuary 9—Zero-Proof Party at Pop (124 W.
