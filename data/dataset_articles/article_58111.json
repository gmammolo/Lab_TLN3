  "text": "On Saturday, we brought you the touching wedding video of Jen and Jay, an adorable pair of lovebirds who also happen to be the talented duo behind Cupcakes and Counting! Their effortlessly elegant destination wedding in Spain was every bit as beautiful as you'd expect a bash organised by two of Ireland's top wedding suppliers to be, so we're delighted to be sharing the full set of photographs with you today! Captured in glorious detail by Into the Light, their big day at El Cigarral de las Mercedes in Toledo was chic and timeless, with a colour palette of cool blues and vibrant greens and so many ideas to steal! Let's take a closer look...\nJen and Jay tell us that they first crossed paths at a local coffee shop. \"We were introduced by a common friend who was having 'girlfriend issues' at the time,\" Jen recalls. \"Jay was with him for moral support, and he then asked me to join them for a 'girl’s opinion.' Jay and I ended up talking to each other!\"\nWhat a bunch of heartbreakers! Groom's party tuxedos always take a wedding to the next level.\nI just adore the brassy, gunmetal colour of these Valentino heels - they add such a cool edge to Jen's bridal look.\nJen dressed her bridesmaids and flower girls in co-ordinating gowns from Mila Santiago de Leon boutique in the Philippines. This soft blue-green shade is just so pretty!\nGah! The first look pictures are always my favourites!\nWas there ever any doubt that these guys would have a jaw-dropping wedding cake!? Despite tying the knot 1,000 miles away from home, they managed to create this flower-embellished beauty - we told you they were among the best in the business!\nIf you think this little guy is cute, just wait until you see the rest of Jen's junior helpers. Don't say we didn't warn you!\nJay proposed in Villefranche-sur-Mer, a quaint fishing village in the South of France, at the end of a two-week holiday. \"Before driving down to the village, Jay bought a postcard of Villefranche,\" Jen tells us. \"I thought it was kind of weird but didn’t really pay too much attention to it. So after a long day of swimming in the Mediterranean coast, we decided to head to one of the restaurants along the pier and watch the sun kiss the sea!\"\nJen says she was none the wiser when Jay whipped out the postcard and suggested a walk to the pier. \"I reluctantly obliged as I was already exhausted at the time. Standing in the pier with my back to the picturesque medieval town, Jay asked me to hold the postcard up so he could take a picture of it. He kept instructing me to hold it right up in front of my face, and I was getting annoyed at this stage. It took me a few seconds to finally notice the question written on the postcard - 'Will you marry me?'\"\nJen tells us that their big day was all about good vibes and good company. \"Our wedding had a very carefree and summery feel,\" she says. \"We kept the decorations minimal, mostly locally-grown flowers and plenty of greenery. It was our very own 'Best Day Ever'.\"\nWhat an incredible spot for a drinks reception! Photographs like these just make us want to be sipping cocktails in the sunshine.\nIt looks like Jen and Jay had some seriously stylish wedding guests!\nThe couple tell us that one of their top priorities was keeping the party (relatively!) small. \"Jay and I love to travel and we wanted to share this adventure with our closest and dearest. We wanted our wedding to be as intimate as possible. It was difficult but we kept our guest list to our original number of 90.\"\nJen tells us that, during a venue-hunting trip to Toledo, the couple failed to get an appointment to see El Cigarral de las Mercedes. Instead, they viewed five others. \"On our last day, we decided to chance our arms and drive up to see the venue. The minute we entered the towering gates, we knew. The olive trees, the breathtaking view of the old city, the vast open space... we knew we had finally found our venue. We were lucky because one of the wedding planners had a cancellation and managed to squeeze us in. She gave us a tour, and we signed the contract right then and there!\"\nThe couple created smart, minimal tablescapes using gold cutlery and candlesticks, tapered sage green candles and abundant greenery.\nWhen we say abundant, we mean abundant!\nWhen asked about their favourite part of the day, both Jen and Jay chose their guests! \"Our friends and family who travelled from all corners of the world made our day extra special.\"\nYou know we love to see women making wedding speeches! Why should the guys have all the fun!?\nThe colours in these portraits are absolutely off the scales! Those blue-green bridesmaid dresses really were an inspired choice.\nI can't believe I've made it this far without gushing about Jen's stunning bridal look! Her Zavana Bridal gown is from Beau Bride in Naas, and is so perfect for a warm-weather wedding. The silhouette is simple and the delicate embroidery is anything but!\nJen's advice for engaged couples is to choose your suppliers wisely! \"On our wedding day, we felt very relaxed and worry-free as we knew that we had the right vendors on board!\"\nAfter the wedding, Jen and Jay headed to Portugal for a mini-moon. \"We rented an old Portuguese villa in Pragança, a mountain village located an hour away from Lisbon. We’re planning to go to the Bahamas for our full honeymoon.\"\nWe just can't get enough of this pair! At this point, we have to say thanks to the amazing team at Into the Light for sharing their beautiful images with us, and, of course, to Jen and Jay for telling us the full story behind their big day.",
