  "text": "Anticipation and excitement started to build at 11:59 a.m. Wednesday as three giant nets filled with 2,000 multicolored balloons hung from the ceiling of the Mammoth Lobby of the Owensboro Museum of Science & History, ready to drop as a crowd of families counted down the final seconds to noon in celebration of the museum’s 19th annual Noon Year’s Eve event.\nFor disc jockey Chad Gesser, owner and operator of Prof G Entertainment Services, he and the event have a lengthy yet positive history.\n“I think the only thing that’s different for me is that it’s not as stressful now as it used to be,” said Gesser, who has served as the master of ceremonies for 15 years. “Now it’s fun.\n“This is the only balloon drop I do in the course of the year,” Gesser added. “I do a lot of different events, but honestly when I get up there … and you look out, (the) lobby will be full of adults, but more importantly kids.\n“The children don’t care if you’re perfect. They don’t care if everything’s exactly how it’s supposed to be,” Gesser said. “They’re just super excited for the mammoth, for the balloons; and that last 15-20 minutes, … that’s my bread and butter.”\nThroughout the years, Gesser has traditionally set up his station under the Columbian Mammoth skeleton — something he finds brings about memories and nostalgia.\n“I remember the first year (participating in the event) how awesome I thought it was to get up here and do this from the mammoth,” Gesser said. “This dates back to my childhood when the museum was over off of South Griffith (Avenue).”\nBeside working Noon Year’s Eve, Gesser said the event has become part of his own family’s traditions — both as attendees and volunteers.\nHis son, Michael Gesser, an assistant bugler for the University of Louisville Cardinal Marching Band, played the traditional New Year’s Eve hymn “Auld Lang Syne” upon the clock striking noon.\n“It’s fun to be able to do this along with my children,” the father of four said, noting his wife, Susan Montalvo-Gesser, and daughter, CeCe Gesser, assisted with face painting activities on-site. “... It’s wonderful.”\nFor 10-year-old Wagoner Strawn, Wednesday marked his first time in attendance at the annual gathering. He tagged along with friend and fellow 10-year-old Dezane Winstead and his family.\n“I like it,” Strawn said of his first impressions, while Winstead, who returned for his second year, said the balloon drop is his main highlight. “It’s good,” he said.\nWhile Strawn and Winstead did not have any New Year’s resolutions planned, the former mentioned looking forward to turning 11 in August.\n“Me and my cousin can’t really ride our bikes that far,” Strawn said, “so hopefully my mom would let us ride our bikes a lot farther.”\nThe 2025 event was also worth celebrating for Isaac G. Settle, who was ringing in his first Noon Year’s Eve since becoming the museum’s executive director in March, following Kathy Olson’s retirement from the organization last December.\n“We’ve had three major events in December. … We have worked very hard, and we have seen it go together almost seamlessly,” he said. “We have a wonderful team. Everybody truly does so much, and sometimes more than they’re even asked. We had so many volunteers and so many people willing to help.\n“There’s just so much momentum right now that everything is just moving forward.”\nAdditionally, Settle enjoys having the opportunity to offer an event to conclude the holiday season that all age groups can participate in.\n“When you think of New Year’s Eve, sometimes the kiddos are left out. You may have celebrations at home, but I remember personally that I couldn’t stay up till midnight; and I don’t even know if they would let me,” Settle laughed. “Having something that allows the kiddos to ring in the new year, and especially at the museum, is just so neat; and just the range of ages that I’ve seen (come in) is just so interesting ….\n“Seeing all the kids just having a blast is wonderful.”\nLike Settle, Gesser hopes to create a “memorable experience” for those who attend the causal observance each year.\n“... I’ve got people that will come up to me as adults that have kids (of their own now) who were here 15 years ago,” he said. “It’s a privilege. It’s a gift. I’m fortunate that I get a chance to do that.\n“If we can make this last day of the year special for some people, that’s all that matters.”",
