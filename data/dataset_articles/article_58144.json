AND i suppose this shall be my war paint to take on the years to come. (sic)\"\nEmbracing all the changes that are coming his way with love and persistence, he added, \"To the years gone by … i see your head popping in n out . I raise you some more love and persistance. Times are changing… we move sideways. I start to see everything on the same plane now- the past the future it all merges here. Not a fan of the gregorian but i must entertain this moment because why not we all need to take a look in ahead within elsewhere..\"\nAli plans to tackle all the curveballs life has to throw at him with his better half, Richa Chadha.\nGiving a shout out to his wife, he concluded, \"@therichachadha - You ready? I almost bought you a sunflower… am steppin in myself today..lets roll this out partner…\"\nWork-wise, Ali will soon be seen reprising his popular role as Guddu Bhaiya for the movie adaptation of the “Mirzapur” franchise.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",
