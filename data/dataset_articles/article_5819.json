  "text": "HARRISBURG, Pa. — Pennsylvania State Police patrol vehicles are getting upgrades.\nOn Thursday, the agency unveiled a series of enhancements to its patrol vehicles that officials say significantly improve visibility during traffic stops and emergency responses, enhancing safety for both troopers and the public.\n“These upgrades represent a major step forward in safety, visibility, and operational efficiency,” said Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens, Acting Commissioner of the PSP. “This department has long set the benchmark for professionalism and innovation, and with this cutting‑edge technology, we will continue to lead by example and set new standards for law enforcement across the nation.”\nThe upgrades include a distinctive V-shaped light bar that provides full 360-degree illumination, dramatically increasing visibility compared to traditional linear bars. The system features GPS‑based vehicle‑to‑vehicle communication that automatically synchronizes flash patterns and voice commands among nearby patrol units, improving coordination and safety at emergency scenes.\nThe light bar functions as an auxiliary brake light during hard braking, an arrow board for traffic control, and a floodlight for use in dark, hazardous environments. In low-light conditions, when the vehicle is parked, an automatic dimming feature enhances vision at night and reduces glare.\nThe department also equipped patrol vehicles with a new 400-watt siren system that includes four speakers and a low-frequency Rumbler device. This system adds low-frequency vibrations to traditional high-frequency tones, increasing sound pressure inside nearby vehicles by up to 10 decibels.\nAs a result, the emergency warning time for motorists to detect and respond to an approaching emergency vehicle has increased. PSP is one of only two law enforcement agencies in the nation with this advanced sound capability.\nTo support these enhancements, PSP modernized the light and siren control panel to make operation simpler and more intuitive. When emergency lights are activated, the controls automatically enter a hands‑free mode, and the public address system remains live at full volume to ensure clear, immediate communication.\nTroopers have access to a selection of automated voice commands, commonly used for traffic stops and incident responses, which are available in English or Spanish and can be repeated as needed.\nThese upgrades reflect the department’s commitment to embracing new technologies and emerging tools to ensure troopers have the resources they need to perform their duties safely and efficiently while strengthening their ability to protect Pennsylvania communities.\nThese enhancements continue the Shapiro Administration’s work to build safer communities and ensure law enforcement is well-trained, well-staffed, well-funded, and well-equipped. The 2025-26 state budget signed by Governor Josh Shapiro invests in new patrol vehicles to replace high-mileage units in the PSP fleet.\nState troopers patrol 44,000 miles of Pennsylvania highway, so it’s not uncommon for their patrol vehicles to reach 200,000 miles before replacement.",
