  "text": "Each year dawns fresh and new, full of promise — but also full of potential pitfalls. In this new year of 2026, it is wise to look back. Jan. 1, 2003, dawned uneasy.\nThose same worries plague us today. There is concern about peace in the world, prosperity at home and, most of all, the growing threat of oligarchy and authoritarian rule in the United States.\nThen-Opinion editor William Waters offered sage advice, wisdom we can use today. The answer to our problems is in we, the people. As the nation begins to celebrate 250 years of existence, the people must step up to ensure the next 250 years.",
