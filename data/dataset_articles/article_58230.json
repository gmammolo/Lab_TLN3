  "text": "My Top Amazon Finds of 2025\n2025 was a big year for Amazon finds around here. I tried a lot, skipped plenty, and ended up with a handful of things I reached for over and over again. These are the items that actually earned a spot in my everyday life, not just something I ordered once and forgot about.\nThese practical little upgrades made getting dressed or getting through the day easier; these were true standouts. If you’re curious what was really worth it this year, these are my top Amazon finds of 2025.\nIf you want to see the full list, check them out on my Amazon storefront here.\nMy Top Amazon Fashion Finds of 2025\nI feel a little spoiled every time I put these silky pajamas on. The satin has that soft, silky feel but isn’t too heavy or clingy, which makes it nice even on warmer nights. It’s oversized in the best way, roomy and comfy without looking like you’re swimming in it. They come in lots of fun prints (seriously, like 40 different ones!), but I went with this gorgeous floral print!\nYou gurls loved this navy midi dress as much as I did! It’s simple, but not boring. Comfortable, but still polished. That little knot detail at the waist? Just enough shape without clinging!\nThis Green Maxi Dress has a smocked bodice that keeps everything nicely in place without feeling tight (praise!), and the white design gives it that “I picked this up from a cute little boutique” feel. No one would guess it came from Amazon Prime.\nEvery now and then, I find an Amazon piece that ends up being one of those permanent closet staples, and this elegant shawl wrap is exactly that. It’s affordable, incredibly soft, and frankly, I’m obsessed.\nI’m wearing the color Barely Twist, a soft neutral that goes with just about everything. It’s cozy, lightweight, and the first thing I grab when I need a little extra warmth (especially when working from home!).\nThese wide-leg floral pants are soft and flowy, with a flattering tie waist that lets you breathe. And the colors? So cheerful, they practically plan your whole outfit for you.\nThis Plaid Knit Coat is the ultimate layering piece because it has the cozy feel of a cardigan but the structure of a coat.\nA handbag can make or break an outfit. This Crossbody Bag resembles the mini LongChamp, but for a fraction of the price! It’s really the perfect size for carrying your essentials like your phone, wallet, keys, and a lip gloss!\nEyelet is one of my favorite textures to add in the spring and summer. This eyelet dress is so darling, and it’s available in a ton of shades, so it should be easy to find one that suits your personal style. It’s so cute for a casual summer wedding, church, or even everyday wear with a comfy pair of sandals!\nThe Wrangler Stretch Denim Jacket is my FAVORITE denim jacket, and it is the perfect layering piece! It adds a bit of warmth for cooler days and gives the entire outfit a more casual, cool vibe. It’s a classic piece that never goes out of style.\nYou gurls loved this Green Printed Maxi Dress this summer! It’s lightweight and breathable. I love that the three-quarter sleeves offer a bit more coverage for the arms, which many of us appreciate. I think the green print is so cute, but it comes in lots of great colors!\nMy Top Amazon Beauty Finds of 2025\nLa Roche-Posay Lipikar Triple Repair Moisturizing Cream:This is one of those boring-looking products, but it’s a staple in my daily routine. It keeps my skin hydrated without feeling greasy and works just as well on arms and legs as it does on dry winter skin anywhere else. If your skin feels tight or itchy, this helps fastLighted Makeup Mirror:Good lighting makes all the difference, especially when makeup starts feeling trickier than it used to. This mirror gives you clear, even light so you can actually see what you’re doing without leaning into the bathroom mirror. This is a must-have for tweezing those stray hairs that pop upRevlon ColorStay Eyeliner Pencil:This has been around forever for a reason. It goes on smoothly, doesn’t tug, and stays put without looking harsh. Great for defining your eyes without that overdone eyeliner look.Tarte Double Take Eyeliner:We love a product that can multi-task! One side of this eyeliner is a pencil, and the other is liquid, so you have options.Gold Bond Crepe Corrector Lotion:This helps to smooth the look of crepey skin and makes arms and legs look more hydrated and firmSexy Hair Big Root Pump Plus:If fine or flat hair is an issue, this stuff helps to add lift right at the roots without feeling sticky or stiff.Medix 5.5 Retinol + Ferulic Acid Body Cream:Think of this as skincare for your body, not just your face. It helps improve texture and firmness over time, especially on areas like arms, thighs, and neck.\nDon’t forget to check out the rest of my top Amazon finds of 2025 on my Amazon storefront here.\nEach time you share my posts on PINTEREST, INSTAGRAM, YOUTUBE, AND FACEBOOK, it not only helps other ladies who might be style-challenged find my blog, but it also strengthens our community. Furthermore, I appreciate every one of you and consider you a friend.\nAre You One Of The GURLS?\nYou’ll receive a daily email reminder from me, keeping you updated when a new blog post is published. Additionally, a special email might occasionally appear in your inbox, so be sure to keep an eye out for it.\nTo GOD Goes The Glory!\nVerse Of The Day\nJohn 5:19 (NIV)\n19 Jesus gave them this answer: “Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.",
