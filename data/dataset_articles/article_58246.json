  "text": "New Year's Eve: World ushers in 2026\nIn New York City's Times Square, revelers braved freezing temperatures to celebrate the new year, gathering for the famed New Year's Eve ball drop.\nCrowds bundled in winter clothing cheered as the crystal-covered ball descended amid falling confetti.\nMany had waited for hours, wearing festive hats and light-up necklaces, to watch the 12,350-pound (5,602-kilogram) ball complete its drop.\nAfter reaching the bottom, the ball rose again, glowing red, white, and blue to mark the upcoming 250th anniversary of the United States.\nThe celebration included a performance by Australian singer Tones and I of John Lennon's \"Imagine.\"\nNew York City Police had planned additional anti-terrorism measures for the ball drop.",
