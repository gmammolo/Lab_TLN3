Newsroom Reviewed\nAs the clock struck midnight and India rang in 2026, data from Swiggy suggested customers opted for a quieter start to the New Year.\nWhile biryani and burgers topped the charts, Swiggy’s live updates on New Year’s Eve 2025 trends showed a tilt towards comfort food and health-focused choices. The delivery platform shared the data with humour.\nHere are some of the food orders placed.\nThe 'Sober' and Simple Celebration One unexpected trend was a rise in comfort orders. While many welcomed the New Year with champagne, 29,618 users chose a cup of chai. Swiggy said these users appeared to have woken up only to wish everyone a happy New Year before returning to sleep.\n“Abhi dekha 29,618 chai order huye hai, bas happy new year wish karne uthe hai ye log,” Swiggy Food wrote.\nabhi dekha 29,618 chai order huye hai, bas happy new year wish karne uthe hai ye log.\n— Swiggy Food (@Swiggy) December 31, 2025 About 9,410 users ordered khichdi, a common Indian comfort meal. Swiggy joked they would be asleep by 10 p.m. Another 4,244 users ordered upma, a traditional breakfast dish.\nSwiggy Food posted, “Aaj ke din bhi 9,410 log khichdi order kar rahe hai. yeh log aaj 10 baje tak so bhi jayenge.”\naaj ke din bhi 9,410 log khichdi order kar rahe hai. yeh log aaj 10 baje tak so bhi jayenge\n— Swiggy Food (@Swiggy) December 31, 2025 Health vs. Halwa New Year’s resolutions and festive eating both showed up in the data. In Bengaluru, 1,927 users ordered salads. Swiggy joked about the trend and said it was now looking at preferences in Delhi.\nIn the balance between health and sweets, desserts led. The platform recorded 46,627 orders of gulab jamun and 7,573 servings of gajar ka halwa.\nbengaluru mein 1,927 logon ne salad order kiya hai, isiliye mujhe dilli ka data dekhne ka mann karta hai. kaise se log hai rehte hai yaar idhar, new year pe salad??!!\n— Swiggy Food (@Swiggy) December 31, 2025 gajar koi nahi khata, halwa sab kha lete hai. abhi tak 7573 gajar ke halwe order ho chuke hai. https://t.co/Gnnb2CTEas\n— Swiggy Food (@Swiggy) December 31, 2025 The Undisputed King Biryani retained its top spot for the 10th year in a row.
