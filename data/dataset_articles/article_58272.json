  "text": "T’was the year that was, a banner year for Gil’s Thrilling (And Filling) Blog with more milestones having been achieved. Most significantly to your friendly neighborhood restaurant review blogger was the continued dialogue–your sharing of comments noting contentment, humor, news or displeasure with me or some other food topic. There are now 14,838 comments on 1,507 reviews. My edacious publicist Bob of the Village of Los Ranchos (BOTVOLR) retains the lifetime commenter achievement award with well over 1200 comments over the life of the blog. In 2024, however, he was supplanted by the always clever and witty Lynn Garner as the year’s most prolific commenter.\n2025 saw the launch of several new restaurants, several of which appear to have long-term appeal. The year also saw the closure of several stalwarts, some of whom served the Duke City for decades. Among those are Zinc Wine & Bistro, Budai Gourmet Chinese and Scalo.\nHere is a list of the most popular reviews on Gil’s Thrilling…\n| MOST POPULAR REVIEWS: 2025 |\n|\nGimani: A Slice Bar(Albuquerque)Perea’s Tijuana Bar & Restaurant(Corrales)Ramona’s Mexican Cafe(Albuquerque)The Burrito Lady(Albuquerque)Il Localetto Rossi(AlbuquerqueThe Sandwich Company(Albuquerque)My Moms(Albuquerque)Mary & Tito’s Cafe(Albuquerque)The Great Greek Mediterranean Grill(Albuquerque)La Super Rica Taqueria(Santa Barbara, California)La Posta De Mesilla(Mesilla)Coda Bakery(Albuquerque)Isleta Grill(Albuquerque)Herencia(Albuquerque)December, 2025\nCOMING: MICHELIN IN NEW MEXICO: For years, the only association MICHELIN had with New Mexico was when vehicles sported Michelin tires. Though many of the Land of Enchantment’s restaurants may be worthy of MICHELIN star honors, that distinction was never accorded. That started to change in December, 2025 a release published on guide.michelin.com: “today brings the exciting announcement of the latest regional addition: The MICHELIN Guide Southwest which includes Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah. Michelin representatives added “Our anonymous Inspectors have been eager to expand further into the Southwest and share their discoveries with the world. We are excited to showcase the distinct cuisine styles that are representative of the cultures throughout the Southwest, which blends a rich mix of traditions and culinary talent.” Contrary to James Beard awards which also emphasize diversity, equity and inclusion, food is MICHELIN’s sole consideration. Service and ambiance are not even considered.\nSANTA FE RESTAURANT AMONG AMERICA’S BEST NEW RESTAURANTS: Leo’s, a Santa Fe eatery showcasing Thai and Malay cuisne, has been named to Esquire Magazine’s annual Best New Restaurants in America list. Within a scant four months of its opening Leo’s was of only 33 eateries across the country to receive that distinction. It was the only New Mexico restaurant included on the list. Esquire described Leo’s thusly: “Until this past August, when Zak Pelaccio and woodworker Jonathan Boyd opened Leo’s in an old auto-body shop on Hickox Street, Santa Fe smelled like desert sage and piñon. Now the air is redolent with galangal and lemongrass. At Leo’s, flavor lurks: The funky paste of crab nam prik is hidden under a chawanmushi like the world’s greatest fruit-at-the-bottom Yoplait, and a steak of pork belly peeks out from underneath a garden’s worth of Thai basil with garlicky chile sauce and a fried egg. Pelaccio—yes, the same shaggy chef known for blazing trails back in the day with Fatty Crab in Manhattan and Fish & Game in the Hudson Valley—moved west a few years ago, but he still goes as hard with spice as a rally driver. His copilot here is twenty-four-year-old Stella Achenbach, a wildly talented first-timer. Together they turn out Thai and Malay dishes as brilliant as an arroyo sunset.”\nROADMAP TO NEW MEXICO’S CUISINE: No, the New Mexico State Tourism Department has not updated its long overdue Green Chile Cheeseburger Trail (last published in 2011). Instead, KRQE’s regional Emmy award-winning producer and television personality Chad Brummett dedicated an episode of Aventura to showcase a roadmap to New Mexico’s cuisine. “From Albuquerque to, from burgers to French toast, join Chad as he takes you around to spots only a local would be able to show you.” It’s a very entertaining feature that doesn’t focus on all the usual suspects.\nWHAT YOU MISS OUT BY NOT BEING ON SOCIAL MEDIA: “Albuquerque yall did it again! Continue to surprise with not only your slept on food. But all the support and love yall give me. Free tacos Thursday December 4th starting at 12pm see yall there! Love yall, god bless yall & support the raza! With that social media post, @thetacofiend declared his presence in Albuquerque and his intention to give away 500 tacos to the Albuquerque community. Thank goodness those tacos didn’t come from Taco Bell or the give-away might have been a disaster. Instead, the tacos were provided by Tacos la Mordida, a highly regarded (beloved) food truck which has been parking and serving tacos at Juan Tabo and Prospect NE for six years.\nM’TUCCI’s REIMAGING ALL A RESTAURANT CAN BE: If you haven’t already heard it, you owe it to yourself to listen to the enthralling story of how M’Tucci’s fostered connection with the community. M’Tucci’s Minister of Culture (and future governor of New Mexico) Howie Kaibel advocates restaurants not only serving food, but nurturing connection. From pioneering 4-day workweeks to launching a nonprofit tutoring program, Howie redefines what business can be when we ask, “How might we serve our community better?” His background in theater and community engagement fuels a hospitality model rooted in creativity and care. You can view his presentation on YouTube.\nNEW MEXICO’S BEST GREEN CHILE CHEESEBURGERS: I frequently (maybe ad nauseum) rail against “clickbait” sites that purport to tell New Mexicans what our best foods are without the benefit of ever having set foot in our enchanted state. That’s why the Tasting Table’s feature on the “best green chile cheeseburgers in New Mexico” carries so much weight with me. This list was compiled by a writer who has actually tasted the burgers she writes about. It’s a hallowed compilation that showcases “some of the best spots for New Mexico’s most iconic burger, from down-home dives to elegant eateries.” Among those purveyors of green chile cheeseburger perfection are San Antonio’s legendary Owl Cafe and its legendary rival The Buckhorn Tavern. There are six other restaurants listed, all of them well worth a drive to reach.",
