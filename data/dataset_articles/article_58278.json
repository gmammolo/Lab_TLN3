  "text": "FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- Everyone wants to have a fun New Year's Eve and a safe New Year. Officials say to make that happen, it's simple: plan ahead.\nThe last day of the year tends to be one of the busiest days for bars, and with that comes risk.\n\"I like to call nights like New Year's Eve, or the day before Thanksgiving or Halloween amateur hour,\" said bar owner Lewis Everk, explaining that people that don't usually go out take the opportunity to celebrate during major holidays.\nEverk wants everyone to know if things get out of control, it's best to let someone know.\n\"If anytime they feel unsafe, just notify one of us,\" he said.\nRELATED: How to prevent injuries during New Year's Eve celebrations\nPartying out can be fun, but it never comes without risks. That's why state law now requires bars to have Naloxone (commonly known as NarCan), as well as kits for testing drinks that were potentially spiked.\nOfficials say that's a good thing, but it's best not to rely on it.\n\"Also, let people know where you're going, when you plan to arrive, when you plan to leave,\" said Clovis Police Sgt. Sean O'Brien.\n\"Make sure that you're going out with people that have got your back and watch you. I think that's the biggest thing,\" said Everk.\nAnother big thing -- find a ride ahead of time.\nIf it's not someone you know getting you home, authorities say rideshare is a safe bet -- but to be cautious if you do.\n\"All of them have safety precautions in place, too, that let you verify who the driver is, the vehicle, color, license plate. All of that information. So double check that information,\" said O'Brien.\nBar owners say they're doing their part to cut people off to limit drunk drivers and are urging patrons to do the same.\n\"I'd rather have somebody mad at me for cutting them off than have to know that they didn't make it home,\" said Everk.",
