  "text": "Thousands of people braved the cold to see in the new year at London’s firework display as the UK ushered in 2026 with a bang.\nDespite the temperature hovering around zero degrees, around 100,000 people gathered on the banks of the River Thames for the sold-out celebration, which was set off near the London Eye at midnight, while millions more tuned in across the country to watch via television.\nThe spectacular display – set to a soundtrack which included the likes of Raye, Sabrina Carpenter, Ed Sheeran and Coldplay and featuring voice overs from stars such as Celia Imrie, Andrew Cotter and Alison Hammond – celebrated some of the highlights of 2025.\nAmong the feats acknowledged in the display were England’s Women’s Rugby World Cup triumph, the Lionesses retaining the Euros and Europe’s Ryder Cup win, while there was also a nod to the film Wicked: For Good.\nMore than 12,000 fireworks and more than 400 lights illuminated the night sky around the London Eye, with hologauze animations complementing the largest annual firework display in Europe on the BBC’s coverage.\nSpeaking to the Press Association, Mayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan said: “We spend a lot of time and effort curating our New Year’s Eve celebrations – the theme of tonight’s celebration is togetherness.\n“I think diversity is a strength not a weakness – it makes us richer not poorer, stronger not weaker. I think you can be a proud Londoner but also someone whose country of origin is somewhere across the globe.\n“I’m delighted that we have once again shown why London’s New Year’s Eve celebrations are the greatest in the world.”\nAs well as celebrating national achievements of the last 12 months, the display also referenced last summer being the UK’s hottest on record and featured a nod to the social media ‘tea-time alarm’ meme that suggested there is a daily alarm reminding British people to enjoy a cup of tea.\nA number of other UK cities are holding new year’s firework displays and events, with Edinburgh’s Hogmanay returning with more than 40,000 attendees after being cancelled due to the weather last year.\nThousands of people began gathering in central Edinburgh before 10pm to get ready to see in the new year at the city’s famous celebrations on Princes Street, where the night’s entertainment includes a pipe band, drummers, a DJ set by Belgian duo 2manydjs, and a silent disco.\nAmong those in attendance was a primary school teacher from New Zealand , who said she came to Edinburgh because “It’s where to be for New Year’s.”\nAnn Bracefield, 55, said: “I have a teacher friend who tried to get in last year from New Zealand and he missed it because it was cancelled.\n“So, it was like, ‘right, I’m going to try’. So, to Scott from Bangkok, I actually made it.”\nAsked to describe the atmosphere on Princes Street as the street party was getting underway, she said: “Good, it’s a bit quiet at the moment but I think it’s going to get really busy.”\nThere is also an hourly “teaser” firework display above Edinburgh Castle in the build-up to the main event, with initial burst going off at 9pm.\nMeanwhile the Concert in the Gardens is getting under way in Princes Street Gardens West, which is being headlined by the band Wet Leg.\nThe organisers said more than 40,000 tickets have been sold for the event, which is seeing a return following last year’s cancellation due to the weather.\nManchester’s official display will take place in the city centre’s St Peter’s Square, while Newcastle upon Tyne’s Quayside will host a “Howaymanay” to ring in the new year.\nThe Geordie take on the Scottish tradition will be a festival of its own, and of course will boast a massive firework display.\nAround the globe, New Year’s Eve firework displays and celebrations have already been held as 2026 began in other time zones.\nThe island of Kiritimati was the first place in the world to celebrate 2026. Part of the Pacific Ocean nation, Kiribati, located south of Hawaii and northeast of Australia. It is made up of several atolls – ring-shaped coral reefs – and spans almost 2,500 miles from east to west.\nAustralia welcomed 2026 with a spectacular fireworks display over Sydney Opera House, as well as a minute’s silence to remember the victims of the Bondi Beach attack.\nThe 40,000 fireworks stretched more than four miles across buildings and barges along the harbour.\nAn hour before midnight, the victims of the country’s deadliest terrorist attack – during which 15 were killed and 40 injured – were commemorated with a moment of reflection while images of a menorah were projected onto Sydney Harbour Bridge. The crowd were invited to show their solidarity with Australia’s Jewish community by shining their phone torches across the harbour.\nJapan and South Korea celebrated the New Year around 3pm GMT with a traditional bell-ringing ceremony. Tens of thousands gathered at Bosingak Pavilion in central Seoul for the countdown.\nAt midnight local time, a bronze bell was struck 33 times, a tradition rooted in Buddhist cosmology, symbolising the 33 heavens.\nThe sounds are believed to dispel misfortune and bring in peace and prosperity for the coming year, while lanterns are lit to celebrate the occasion.\nFireworks also lit up the sky over the Lotte World Tower in Seoul, South Korea's tallest building, before an eye-catching display was set off over the Marina Bay in Singapore.\nThe fireworks in the UK will come before New York, which will join in the celebrations at 5am GMT on New Year’s Day, with performances by Diana Ross and Ciara. People queued around 6th Avenue hours in advance.",
