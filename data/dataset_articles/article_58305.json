  "text": "With winter in full swing, we want our everyday outfits to be just as cosy and comfortable as they are chic. And, on the hunt for inspiration, we came across Lauren Silverman’s easy leggings outfit formula that makes blending practicality, comfort and style a breeze for the season.\nBack in 2020, she was spotted out in London wearing a winter capsule wardrobe staple, black leggings. Styling them up with a cream knit and a pair of tan, kitten heel ankle boots, the leggings were transformed from a cosy, loungewear item into something far more chic. Just what we need right now.\nFinishing off her leggings and boots outfit formula with an aviator jacket, the brown faux-fur trim perfectly complemented the tan shade of her boots. This is a cool and cosy style that's easy to recreate.\nrecreate Lauren Silverman's cosy style\nThis oversized aviator jacket has just dropped on the Nordstrom website and we're expecting it to sell out fast thanks to its versatile, brown faux-leather and on trend, relaxed fit.\nWhile we love the comfort of our go-to jersey leggings, this pair from COS are even cosier thanks to ultra-soft merino wool fabric.\nThese elegant ankle boots are a real all-rounder, pairing effortlessly with casual leggings and jeans to elevate your outfits, while also working alongside more formal looks.\nThis faux-leather jacket is trimmed and lined with soft faux shearling to give it a cosy finish. The neutral tones of brown and cream make it a versatile staple.\nAvailable in short, regular and long leg lengths, these leggings from Mint Velvet make sure you get the ideal fit. A mid-rise waist and ankle-grazing hem create a sleek look.\nThis boxy wool jumper is from H&M's premium collection, with chunky, ribbed hems, dropped shoulders, and crafted from 100% wool knit, it's a luxe piece to wear all winter.\nLauren might have stepped out in this look more than five years ago, but it has a timeless charm that still holds weight today. Her aviator jacket not only plays into the best winter coat trends 2025, but the faux-fur trim is also directional.\nFaux-furs and shearling were all over the runways, quickly becoming one of the biggest autumn/winter fashion trends for 2025 – and in the midst of this season’s cold weather, we don’t expect them to go anywhere.\nAs we head into some serious downtime, we'll all be reaching for our favourite legging outfits to see us through, and Lauren's taken this athleisure style and given it the kind of fashion-forward makeover that will help us step out in style, while keeping comfortable and cosy.",
