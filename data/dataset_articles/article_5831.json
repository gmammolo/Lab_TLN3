  "text": "By Paige Gawley ,\n1 hours ago M√∂tley Cr√ºe is celebrating a legal victory. In a press release , the band announced that it‚Äôs won ‚Äúa decisive victory‚Äù against its former guitarist, Mick Mars.\nVideos by American Songwriter\nAn independent arbitrator ruled entirely in favor of the band following a years-long legal battle. After Mars‚Äô 2022 retirement, the guitarist sought 25 percent of the band‚Äôs touring revenue.\nThat wish, the band argued, went against their 2008 governing agreement. That agreement ‚Äúexplicitly provides that any member who stops touring does not share in touring income.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe arbitrator flatly rejected that position,‚Äù the press release read. ‚ÄúThe final award also upheld the band‚Äôs decision to terminate Mars as an officer and director for legal cause and ordered him to repay more than $750,000 in unrecouped tour advances.‚Äù\nWhile the litigation was pending, Mars ‚Äúlaunched a public media campaign accusing the band of not playing live.‚Äù Specifically, he alleged that Nikki Sixx‚Äôs bass and Tommy Lee‚Äôs drums were prerecorded. He made his allegations, which the band strongly denied, both under oath and during press interviews.\nEventually, after testimony from a New York University professor specializing in music technology, ‚ÄúMars was forced to admit under oath that his statements were false.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThis dispute was about protecting the integrity and legacy of one of the most successful bands in rock history,‚Äù the band‚Äôs lawyer, Sasha Frid, said. ‚ÄúWith the arbitrator rejecting every claim and enforcing the parties‚Äô agreements as written, the band has been fully vindicated‚Äîlegally, financially, and factually.‚Äù\nAfter the ruling, Sixx reacted to the news on Facebook , writing, ‚ÄúFinally the truth.‚Äù\nM√∂tley Cr√ºe‚Äôs Upcoming Tour M√∂tley Cr√ºe is currently comprised of Six, Lee, vocalist Vince Neil, and guitarist John 5. The band will set off on a North American tour this summer. The tour is being put on in honor of the 20th anniversary of Carnival of Sins . It‚Äôs also marking M√∂tley Cr√ºe‚Äôs 45th anniversary as a group.\nDubbed The Return of the Carnival of Sins , the run will kick off July 17 in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, and criss cross the nation. The band‚Äôs last show is scheduled to take place Sept. 26 in Ridgefield, Washington.\n$1 of every ticket sold will be donated to ASAP! (After School Arts Program) through the M√∂tley Cr√ºe Giveback initiative to support students with hands-on programs in music and the arts.\nPhoto by Chris Walter/Getty Images",
