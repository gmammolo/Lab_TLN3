  "text": "Whether or not we realize it, all of us practice daily rituals. Maybe you read the news with breakfast, or maybe you always take a long bath on Friday nights. Rituals are simply practices that add some shape to our days. Chosen wisely, they can consistently bring a bit of pleasure, calm and fun into even the most chaotic times.\nAs a culinary educator and a holistic creativity coach, I have helped dozens of people weave joyful daily rituals into their lives. And the new year is an ideal time to shake things up. Just start with one or two that you love, and work them into your week. Before you know it, you will have fun, calming moments to look forward to every day – and you’ll want to add more.\nNeed some inspiration? Here are some of my favorites for every corner of your life, from waking up to winding down, all time tested by my clients and me.\n***\nRituals for a cozy home\nBuilding some intentional practices around your home can transform it into a sanctuary where you can exhale, drop the worries of the day and really be yourself – even if you also have to work there.\nStart by setting the mood for peace with favorite scents, calm lighting and objects that invoke a sense of peace. I light a candle when I start writing each day, then blow the candle out before I move on to the rest of my work. This simple ritual helps make creative time feel special. Secular saint candles from the Unemployed Philosophers Guild swap biblical characters for creative greats including John Lennon and Frida Kahlo.\nI also love Apotheke’s mini candle tins, which smell exactly like the ingredients, not like cheap extracts. They burn up to 15 hours and are small enough to toss in my bag and take with me when I travel to make any room feel a bit more like home.\nIf time at home feels like an endless parade of to-dos, keep recreational activities front and center: that puzzle you’ve been wanting to complete, a sketchbook and pencils, your long-neglected guitar. Making the hobbies you love accessible means you’re more likely to do them when you have free time to fill.\nIf you work in a multi-use space, such as a desk in the living room, try investing in a room divider: unfold the screen to separate your workspace from the rest of the space, then fold back up at the end of the day for a quick ritual that will help you focus while you’re working and relax when you’re not.\nYou can also use scent to divide the day. One of my clients applies one scent at the beginning of his work day and another scent at the end of the day, so he has a sensory cue to help him move between parts of his life. Rafa Naturals’ Old Florida spray smells like juicy oranges and magnolias, which are sentimental for me and transport me with a quick sniff. The fragrance lasts but isn’t overpowering or artificial-smelling, and you can use it on your body or around the house.\n***\nSecular Saint Candles from Unemployed Philosopher’s Guild\n$18.95 at the Unemployed Philosophers Guild\n$18.95 at Amazon\n***\nApotheke mini candle tins\n$12 at Apotheke\n$12 at Demarchelier & Co\n***\nVevor wood room divider\n$72.99 at Amazon\n$79.99 at Vevor\n***\nRafa Natural Old Florida room and body spray\n$8 at Rafa Natural\n***\nHands on, screens off\nCrafts and journaling can offer a short break between tasks, or a fun way to wind down in the evening without a screen.\nMy go-to break is to grab a favorite journal and some Micron pens, which have smooth, consistent lines and come in a range of thicknesses and colors. Every artist I know swears by them, and they’ve been a staple in my purse for 20 years. They’re up for any task, from your latest drawing-a-day challenge to writing.\nFor serious writers, try a sturdy, thoughtfully made fountain pen like the Lamy Joy, which is lightweight and ergonomic enough to use for long periods and comes with several different nibs for writing. I also adore my Schon Pocket 6, a compact fountain pen for bringing on the go that’s comfortable to use and comes in a range of exciting colors. Yes, they’re an investment – but they make the ritual of daily journaling and drawing all the more pleasurable (plus they’re beautiful to look at).\nMoleskine Cahier journals are the perfect all-purpose, blank journal for daily practice. They come in a variety of colors and sizes, easily tuck into a purse or pocket, and the finished journals fit on a bookshelf without taking up much space.\nFor creative journaling prompts, the Ordinary Habit For Now journal offers a cue to slow down and notice the world around you more deeply, then write or draw about what you see. For instance, you might describe your favorite meal this week or a cherished memory you return to often. It is the perfect jump-start for those new to journaling or those who want to reconnect to the magic of daily living through writing or drawing.\nA craft kit can also unlock new hobbies. These Hollander’s bookbinding and box-making kits come with almost everything you need to make your own box or book, except a good bookbinding glue brush. Unlike cheaper models from a craft store, these use acid-free board that won’t deteriorate quickly, and the same supplies can be used for collage and scrapbooking.\nStart simple with crafts that are a minimal investment of time and money so you can reap the rewards of a finished project quickly, then build from there. This entry-level paper marbling kit is easy to use, comes in a range of vibrant colors and lets you achieve finer detail than many entry-level kits. Crochet is another favorite for evenings when I need something to do with my hands (but am too tired to write) and don’t want to reach for my phone. Or go back to a popular childhood craft and grab a potholder loom to weave together colorful loops of cotton for custom square potholders.\nWant a craft to make a ritual out of your bus ride or lunch break? Bring a traveling creativity kit, such as this mini traveling watercolor set, which contains 15 different colors in a compact case that is easy to toss in with your brushes (or traveling water pens) with a small pad of paper.\n***\nHollander’s bookbinding and box-making kits\nFrom $55 at Hollander’s\n***\nBookbinding glue brush\nFrom $6.05 at Talas\n***\nJaquard paper marbling kit\n$16.79 at Plaza Art\n***\nPotholder loom\n$19.49 at Blick Art Materials\n$19.99 at Amazon\n***\nAquastroke-Go Water Brush Pens\n$10.89 at Jerry’s Artarama\n$16.99 at Amazon\n***\nSoHo Watercolor Travel Set\n$24.39 at Jerry’s Artarama\n$30.97 at Amazon\n***\nSakura Pigma Micron Pens\n$9.99 for six at Amazon\n$12.49 for six at Blick Art Materials\n***\nLamy Joy fountain pen\n$99 at Lamy\n***\nSchon DSGN Pocket 6 fountain pen\n$108 at the Goulet Pen Company\n$125 at Schon DSGN\n***\nMoleskine Cahier journals\n$13.10 for three at Walmart\n$14.40 for three at Amazon\n***\nOrdinary Habit For Now journal\n$28 at Ordinary Habit\n$28 at Anna Grace\n***\nMindful eating and cooking\nYou’re already eating every day, but rituals can help you elevate meals from a calorie intake sessions to something more. Think intentionally when plating the salad you packed for lunch rather than wolfing it down out of a Tupperware. Slowing down, even just a bit, helps you reconnect to the present moment.\nSo does tapping into each of your senses. As you cook, and later as you eat, notice what each sense is picking up in that moment: what colors do you see? What layers of flavors do you notice? What do you smell? What is the texture or temperature of the food or drink (and does it change as you cook)? For an easy, no-cook version, enjoy a square of dark chocolate, such as Xocolatl’s espresso chocolate bar or Mast’s 80% dark chocolate, or have a piece of fruit and let yourself notice the flavor and texture as you eat.\nRather than a gulp-and-go caffeine fix, treat your morning coffee the same way. I love a freshly ground cup of Sacred Cups Aponte Inga medium roast every morning. The complex flavors and aroma unfold one layer at a time, which makes it easy to tap into my own mindfulness ritual as I sip.\nPrefer herbal tea? Traditional Medicinals is a tried and true (and widely available) option for tea lovers looking for a variety of caffeine-free flavors. Try hot or iced lemon balm tea for a calming and refreshing afternoon drink, dandelion leaf and root as a robust coffee stand-in, or chamomile and lavender as a soothing, hot drink before bed. Their focus on sourcing concentrated, flavorful herbs comes through in the nuanced aroma and flavor in each cup, and they’re a great way to unplug and reset midday or in the evening.\nEven soda water can be a beverage to savor, if you spruce it up a bit. Digestive bitters are a classic add-in: I love Red Moon’s Deep Roots, which combines several bitter herbs, giving it a complex and rich flavor that doesn’t overpower my drinks. Or experiment with essences like lavender – or my favorite, orange-blossom water. Buying concentrated, small batch essences from expert makers, such as these from Flower Power, means a headier aroma and flavor that holds up when diluted. Add just a tiny amount until you know your preferences: you can always add more later!\n***\nSacred Cups Aponte Inga coffee\n$32 at Purity Coffee\n***\nTraditional Medicinals teas\nLemon Balm\n$5.32 at Amazon\n$6.99 at iHerb\nDandelion Leaf and Root\n$5.49 at Amazon\n$5.88 at Walmart\nChamomile and lavender\n$4.67 at Amazon\n$4.98 at Walmart\n***\nRed Moon Herbs Deep Roots blend\n$14 at Red Moon Herbs\n$14 at Woven Roots Collective\n***\nFlower Power flower waters\n$16 at Flower Power\n***\nXocolatl wide-eyed espresso bar\n$11 at Xocolatl\n***\nMast organic dark chocolate 80% cacao\n$8 at Mast Market\n$45 for six at Amazon\n***\nMidday resets\nQuick, midday breaks help keep you energized and clear brain fog. I make a daily ritual out of regular bursts of movement, such as a short visit to the park or walk around the block, and I keep my yoga mat nearby for a few poses between calls. Even just a few minutes makes a difference.\nFor inspiration, I subscribe to Cork Lotus Yoga’s video library, an independent studio that offers classes I can take at home. My favorites focus on mobility and breathwork, and some are as short as 10 minutes. Another favorite is Tough Love Yoga’s recording library, also run by an experienced, independent teacher who focuses on alignment.\nOr why not turn to play as a daily ritual? My favorites are hula-hooping, jumping rope, drawing or dancing to a favorite song. To really work up a sweat, try a weighted hula hoop.\nSome simple pleasures can be taken on the go, like putting your favorite beverage in a thermos and sipping as you take a quick walk. Or, invest in a quality water bottle to help you enjoy staying hydrated throughout the day. I also add Buoy hydration drops, which are unflavored so they can go in whatever I’m drinking.\nTake a break and make some midday matcha: mindfully whisking it is both grounding and centering. I have drank a lot of matcha over the years, and Zenkyu’s ceremonial-grade matcha is among the best: clean and green but not overly grassy.\nGet some midday shuteye, or just pause for a few breaths with an eye mask. Kitsch makes a satin sleep mask with just enough weight to gently massage tired eyes, and the soothing lavender scent helps you relax. You can customize both the weight of the mask and the strength of the lavender scent. Pair it with rain sounds or nature noises (I like tree.fm, a free site with forest sounds from around the world), through noise canceling headphones for a relaxing break.\n***\nBose noise canceling headphones\n$269.99 at Amazon\n$279 at Bose\n***\nKitsch weighted lavender eye mask\n$19.19 at Amazon\n$20 at HoneyBug\n***\nStanley Stay-Hot Camp Mug\n$19.50 at Stanley\n$22.50 at Amazon\n***\nZenkyu signature blend matcha\n$44 at Zenkyu\n***\nBuoy hydration drops\n$38.95 for three-pack at Amazon\n$39 for three-pack at Buoy\n***\nCork Lotus yoga video library subscription\n$22.30 a month\n***\nTough Love Yoga video library subscription\n$50 a month\n***\nMarcy weighted hula hoop\n$27.99 at Dick’s Sporting Goods\n$34.99 at Marcy Pro\n***\nRituals for self-care and evening time\nMany of us run through our days without pausing to take a breath, then roll into bed without winding down, especially when things are busy. But slowing down, even pausing to appreciate activities you’re already doing, can help end the day on a calm note and drift off to sleep more easily.\nA full facial every evening isn’t practical, but a few tried-and-true products help me chill my nervous system while keeping my skin healthy. I gently cleanse, then use Peter Thomas Roth’s pumpkin enzyme mask when I want to exfoliate, before layering on Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Concentrate. In winter, I also layer on some homemade face salve for extra moisture, or I use this calendula salve, which protects my skin barrier overnight – meaning I wake up with soft skin even in January.\nI wrap everything up by using a gua sha tool to gently massage my face and neck and circulate lymph. This one from Mount Lai is the perfect size and weight for your face, and the jade stone cools your skin as you work.\nFew things beat a good bubble bath. For me, basic epsom salts are all it takes to relax mind and body without a huge price tag. I use unscented Dr Teal’s – it’s a classic for a reason – and add my own essential oils, plus flower petals to make it extra special.\nOr you could enjoy a foot bath while reading or watching a favorite movie. I have had this Homedics Spa Elite for about a decade, and I love the warming and bubbling options so I can enjoy an extended soak without the water going cold.\nOnce you’re done pampering yourself, wrap up and get cozy. This Toast flannel bathrobe is cozy, lightweight and ridiculously soft. Its vintage-inspired pattern makes me feel like a midcentury novelist, sitting down at my typewriter for a late-night writing session.\nFor something extra warm, this Bedsure wearable blanket hoodie is made from thick, cozy fleece and covers you from head to toe: perfect for the chronically chilly. As a bonus, it’s a great coverup to bring camping or to warm up quickly if you, like me, enjoy a brisk, wintertime ocean swim.\nFor my feet, my favorite slippers are Montreal mules from Blowfish Malibu. They have a thick enough sole to wear them outside without damaging them (which is good, because I wear them to the store pretty frequently), and their fluffy lining is comfortable, but not so thick that I break out in a sweat. In extra cold weather, I also bust out Redhead’s heavyweight wool socks, which have been my go-to winter sock for about 20 years. During my previous life as a bus driver, they kept my feet from freezing as I tramped through the snow in subzero temperatures to get to my pre-dawn shifts. Even at home, they’re warm without being stifling and are never itchy.\n***\nDr Teal’s Epsom salts\n$5.74 at Walmart\n$6.09 at Vitacost\n***\nHomedics Spa Elite foot bath\n$54.99 at Amazon\n$54.99 at Macy’s\n***\nToast Forte flannel gown\n$290 at Toast\n***\nBedsure Gentlesoft blanket hoodie\n$32.99 at Wayfair\n$35.99 at Amazon\n***\nBlowfish Malibu Montreal mules\n$36.99 at Famous Footwear\n$37.49 at Macy’s\n***\nRedhead heavyweight wool socks\n$13.98 at Cabela’s\n$13.98 at Bass Pro Shops\n***\nPeter Thomas Roth pumpkin enzyme mask\n$40.11 at Walmart\n$42 at DermStreet (discount in cart)\n***\nDr Kiehl’s midnight recovery serum\n$57 at Kiehl’s\n$57 at Nordstrom\n***\nTwin Flower botanicals calendula salve\n$9 at Twin Flower Botanicals\n***\nMount Lai gua sha tool\n$30 at Nordstrom\n$30 at Amazon",
