  "text": "Fernando Alonso never does anything by halves. Just days before Christmas, the two-time Formula 1 world champion took delivery of a brand-new Aston Martin DBX S, directly in Monaco. The luxury SUV, estimated to be worth over £210,000, immediately caused a sensation.\nOutside the Aston Martin Monaco dealership, Alonso posed proudly alongside his new ultramarine black vehicle, perfectly embodying the festive spirit… in a very high-end version.\nAston Martin Monaco celebrates its ambassador, Fernando Alonso\nThe dealership was quick to share the moment on social media:\n“A festive and memorable Christmas for @fernandoalo_oficial, as we had the pleasure of delivering his brand new Aston Martin DBX S. The entire Aston Martin Monaco team wishes you a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!”\nTrue to form, the response ofAlonso remained minimalist, but eloquent:\n\"Exceptional.\"\nThis delivery comes at the end of a mixed 2025 season for Aston MartinDespite high ambitions and significant investment, the AMR25 slipped in the manufacturers' championship, dropping from fifth to seventh place, behind Williams et\nRacing Bulls.\nAt 44 years,\nFernando Alonso However, he proved that his talent and experience remain intact, maximizing every scoring opportunity and confirming his central role in the British team's project.\nUnder the hood, the Aston Martin DBX S boasts a 4,0-liter twin-turbo V8 from Mercedes, producing 727 horsepower. The result: a 0 to 100 km/h sprint in 3,3 seconds, thanks to a lightweight chassis and a nine-speed automatic transmission.\nThis exceptional model joins an already prestigious collection, which notably includes a Aston Martin Valiant and Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR.\nBeyond the symbolism, this Christmas gift comes at a pivotal time for Aston Martin. With the new regulations coming into effect in 2026, the engine partnership with Honda and the arrival of expertise by Adrian NeweyThe team has big ambitions.\nFor Fernando AlonsoThis DBX S could well be the harbinger of brighter days on the road and on the track.",
