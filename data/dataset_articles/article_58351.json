  "text": "Latest update January 1st, 2026 12:36 AM\nJan 01, 2026\nSports\nKaieteur Sports – Building on the momentum of a highly successful 2024 and a year of steady advancement in 2025, Lusignan Golf Club enters 2026 with confidence, ambition, and a clear focus on continued growth, partnership, and excellence.\nLusignan Golf Club President, Ms. Anasha Ally, reflected on the club’s progress and outlined an optimistic outlook for the year ahead, noting that her re-election allowed the executive committee to further strengthen the foundation laid in 2024.\n“Continuing from a successful 2024 and following my re-election, we focused on building on what we started,” President Ally said. “A restructured executive committee saw members placed in new roles, and the results have been very encouraging. The entire committee has performed credibly, as demonstrated by the successful hosting of the Brava Guyana Open and several other tournaments, even with weather challenges at times.”\nLooking ahead to 2026, Lusignan Golf Club is preparing for a dynamic calendar of major events, including the highly anticipated AmCham Golf Tournament, along with a number of other national and regional competitions. These events are expected to further elevate the club’s standing while offering significant visibility, engagement, and networking opportunities for corporate partners.\nPresident Ally also highlighted continued infrastructural and operational investments aimed at enhancing the overall golfing experience. Lusignan Golf Club is in the process of acquiring new grounds equipment to further improve course quality and maintenance standards. The club has also expanded its fleet of golf carts, while the clubhouse continues to benefit from upgrades including new bathroom facilities, fresh painting, and other outdoor improvements.\n“These investments directly translate into better playing conditions and an enhanced experience for our members and visitors,” Ally added. “We have also seen encouraging growth in membership and participation, which reflects the positive direction in which the club is heading.”\nThe President expressed sincere appreciation to existing corporate sponsors, acknowledging their integral role in the club’s development and the successful execution of major tournaments. She also issued a strong invitation to Corporate Guyana to partner with the club in 2026.\n“As we move into 2026, Lusignan Golf Club actively welcomes new corporate sponsors and partners,” Ally stated. “Sponsorship of the club and its events provides meaningful brand exposure, direct engagement with key stakeholders, and an opportunity to contribute to the continued growth of golf in Guyana. We look forward to building mutually beneficial partnerships with Corporate Guyana as we expand our events calendar and continue to enhance our facilities.”\nDespite wider national staffing challenges, Lusignan Golf Club has successfully retained dedicated and experienced grounds and clubhouse staff, a factor Ally described as essential to the club’s ongoing success. “We could not do this without our hardworking staff. Their commitment and professionalism are fundamental to maintaining the standards of the course and the club,” she said.\nAs the new year begins, Lusignan Golf Club reaffirms its commitment to development, collaboration, and excellence, ensuring that 2026 will be a year of opportunity, growth, and excitement for members, sponsors, and visitors alike.\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
