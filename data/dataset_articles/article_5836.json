  "text": "The Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) says its investigation into contractual arrangements between Strategic Mobilisation Ghana Limited (SML) and the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) saved the Republic a total of GH¢5,730,975,354.42.\nThe disclosure was contained in the OSP’s 2025 Half-Yearly Report, issued in December 2025 and signed by the Special Prosecutor, Kissi Agyebeng.\n“The OSP investigation saved the Republic an aggregate of Five Billion Seven Hundred and Thirty Million Nine Hundred and Seventy-Five Thousand Three Hundred and Fifty-Four Cedis Forty-Two Pesewas (GH¢5,730,975,354.42).\n“The accused in the SML case deliberately sought to deprive the Republic of a further Two Billion Seven Hundred and Ninety-Nine Million Six Hundred and Four Thousand Eight Hundred and Sixty-Four United States Dollars Seventy-One Cents (US$2,799,604,864.71),” the report stated.\nThe OSP on October 30, 2025, presented its findings at a press briefing on the contractual arrangements between SML, the GRA and the Ministry of Finance. The contracts were purportedly aimed at enhancing revenue assurance in the downstream petroleum sector, upstream petroleum production, and the minerals and metals value chain.\nAccording to the OSP, its investigation revealed that “there was no genuine need for contracting SML for the obligations it purported to perform” and that the contracts were secured through “self-serving official patronage, sponsorship and promotion based on false and unverified claims.”\nThe report further stated that the SML contracts were characterised by serious statutory breaches, noting that mandatory prior approvals were “wantonly disregarded” by relevant officials, who acted with “emboldened impunity.”\n“There was no established financial management system of monitoring and verification to ensure that the Republic was obtaining value for money paid to SML, and the payment channels were set on automatic mode, detached from actual performance, causing financial loss to the Republic,” the report added.\nThe OSP said its investigation showed that former Minister of Finance, Kenneth Nana Yaw Ofori-Atta; Ernest Darko Akore, former Chief of Staff to Mr. Ofori-Atta; former GRA Commissioners-General Emmanuel Kofi Nti and Ammishaddai Owusu-Amoah; former Commissioner of the Customs Division of GRA, Isaac Crentsil; Member of Parliament for Jaman South and former Customs Commissioner, Col. (rtd) Kwadwo Damoah; and Evans Adusei, beneficial owner and Chief Executive Officer of SML, conspired to set up the company.\n“The actions of these persons created the opportunity for SML to largely pretend to perform the services under the various contracts, leading to immense financial loss to the Republic of about One Billion Four Hundred and Thirty-Six Million Two Hundred and Forty-Nine Thousand Eight Hundred and Twenty-Eight Cedis Fifty-Three Pesewas (GH¢1,436,249,828.53),” the report said.\nFollowing the findings, President John Dramani Mahama, on October 31, 2025, directed the cancellation of all public procurement contracts awarded to SML by the GRA and the Ministry of Finance.\nThe OSP said it has since concluded its investigation into the matter.",
