  "text": "N ew Year Exclusive: As the calendar turns to 2026, actor Rohit Chandel is stepping into the new year with clarity, calm, and a renewed sense of balance.\nKnown for his impactful performance in the hit Star Plus show Pandya Store, Rohit believes the past year has played a key role in shaping his mindset, both as an actor and as a person.\nROHIT CHANDEL ON THE BIGGEST LESSON HE LEARNED IN 2025\nLooking back at 2025, Rohit Chandel says the biggest lesson he is carrying forward is learning how to remain steady even when things feel overwhelming. Sharing his thoughts in an exclusive chat with Filmibeat, the actor says, \"The most important lesson I learnt in 2025 is how to stay patient, calm, and composed when there is chaos around you. Because the power is in not reacting, that is the biggest power. So, stay calm, composed, and neutral always.\"\nAccording to Rohit, this approach has helped him deal with pressure, noise, and uncertainty with more confidence.\nWhen asked about what excites him most about entering 2026, Rohit keeps it honest and grounded. Rather than chasing too many things at once, the actor wants to simplify his life and focus on what truly matters.\n\"I&apos;ll try to focus more on my work. I&apos;ll keep myself away from distractions. I&apos;ll try to be with my family and loved ones. 2025 was a hectic year. But this year, I&apos;ll try to balance everything,\" he shares. Rohit adds that creating a healthy balance between work and personal life is a priority going forward.\nROHIT CHANDEL ON HIS NEW YEAR 2026 WISHLIST\nInterestingly, Rohit does not believe in making long wish lists for the new year. Instead, he prefers to stay grateful and open to life&apos;s surprises. Talking about his hopes for 2026, he says, \"I don&apos;t really have a wish list because I&apos;m genuinely happy and grateful for everything I&apos;m working on right now. I believe magic happens around us every single day-we just need to redefine what magic means to truly notice it.\"\nHe further adds that while work is going well and he feels content, he is always ready to welcome something new if it comes his way. \"If something unexpected and magical comes my way, I&apos;ll be ready to embrace it. More than anything, I wish for good health and happiness for the people around me,\" Rohit says, calling health and well-being the biggest blessing he hopes for in 2026.\nWith a calm mindset, gratitude, and a focus on balance, Rohit Chandel is clearly entering the new year with purpose and positivity.\nAakash Kumar Filmibeat source: filmibeat.com",
