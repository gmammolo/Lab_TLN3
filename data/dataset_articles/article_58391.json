  "text": "Head on a culinary journey at these best Ganga-view cafes in Rishikesh offering serene views of the sacred river. We suggest what to eat and how to enjoy a hot brew at these scenic eateries.\nA calming wave of emotion washes over you as you sit by the sacred Ganga in Rishikesh in India. Coupled with a hot brew, delectable bites, and indulgent desserts, the culinary voyage in the ‘Yoga capital of the world’ is an experience you cannot miss. Let us take you through a selection of top Ganga-view cafes in Rishikesh that you must visit on your next trip.\nAdd these tranquil riverside beaches in Rishikesh to your itinerary to spend some quality time by the sacred river.\nNestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, Rishikesh orchestrates a breathtaking view of the vibrant culture, engulfing hills, and the Ganga River flowing beautifully. It’s the bustling lanes of Tapovan, and the quiet streets of Laxman Jhula are two of the areas where most of the Rishikesh cafes with a river view are located. The former is easily accessible by road from both Haridwar and Dehradun. It’s the latter that will require you to cross the river on foot, either through the Ram Jhula bridge or the new Bajrang Setu glass bridge.\nConsidering that good food is the way to feel at home when travelling, we’ve picked cafes that offer inviting ambience, cleanliness, flavourful dishes, well-crafted beverages, and a panoramic view of the mighty Ganga River.\nBest time to visit Ganga-view cafes in Rishikesh\nCafes in Rishikesh are known for their breakfast bowls and healthy smoothies, making mornings the best time to visit a cafe. Start your day with a hearty, healthy fruit bowl, a cup of cappuccino and the calming waters of the Ganga River, the perfect recipe for a slow morning. The afternoons are best for a North Indian meal with a side of Rishikesh’s signature ginger lemon honey tea. Visit Ganga-view cafes in the evenings to try new cuisines, particularly Israeli, Mexican, Italian, Chinese, and Tibetan.\nCafes in Rishikesh with the best view of the Ganga\nOm Freedom Cafe\nThis cafe is so popular, the ghat that it’s located on took the name of the cafe. Situated on the Laxman Jhula side, Om Freedom Cafe is one of the oldest and most popular river-view cafes in Rishikesh. It has four types of seating spaces – a cosy indoor area, a mezzanine open space, a shaded area, and one space directly by the river where it flows right beside you. Your feast must include Mixed Veg Cheese Bruschetta, a Cappuccino, Lasagna alla Napoletana, Broccoli Rice Noodles, Tacos, Nutella Banana Pancake, and the Freedom Special Dessert.\n- Timings: 10:30 am to 10:30 pm (Monday-Sunday)\n- Google rating: 4 (over 3.9K Google reviews)\n- Contact: +91 07302681057\n- Address: Freedom Ghat, Laxman Jhula, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand 249302\nBookmark this guide to Mussoorie, Landour and beyond for your next visit.\nGanga View Cafe\nNestled by the Laxman Jhula bridge, Ganga View Cafe is one of my top favourite cafes in Rishikesh, solely for its contemporary setting. It’s best known for its unique flavours and vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free cooking options. The aroma of freshly baked cakes, from Tiramisu to Banoffee Pie, will pull you in. Lush plants keep you company as you dig into a variety of cuisines like North Indian, Chinese, Italian, and Israeli. My personal favourite is the Pad Thai noodles, for which I keep coming back to this place. Ideal for breakfast (healthy bowls) and a sundowner; sit by the river with the Laxman Jhula in the backdrop. Pick a storybook while you wait for your food to arrive.\nAlso read | Himachal Pradesh Vs Uttarakhand: Which Mountain Experience Calls To You?\n- Timings: 8 am to 10 pm (Monday-Sunday)\n- Google rating: 4.4 (over 2.8K Google reviews)\n- Contact: +91 09297972929\n- Address: Near 13 Stories Temple, Laxman Jhula, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand 249302\nBeatles Cafe\nOffering panoramic views of the Ganga River and the Laxman Jhula side is the Beatles Cafe. Situated in a cosy lane in the lower Tapovan area, the Ram Jhula and humongous temples are also visible from the Beatles Cafe. It is designed as an ode to the English rock band, The Beatles, with paintings of the band as wall decor. Here you’ll be treated with prompt service and flavourful dishes and beverages. If you’re visiting in the hotter months, try their fruit coolers or frappes. Save the lattes and ginger honey lemon tea for the winter. Gulp on their burgers and sandwiches, and for the afternoon spread, order Chinese and Thai delicacies or go for the classic pizza. Expect a waiting time on the weekends, as it is houseful during peak hours of lunch and late evenings.\n- Timings: 11:30 am to 9:30 pm (Monday to Sunday; Tuesday closed)\n- Google rating: 4.2 (over 3.5K Google reviews)\n- Contact: +91 07618161717\n- Address: Tapovan, Sarai, Paidal Marg, Near Divine Resort Radhe Krishna Mandir, Near Divine Resort, Laxman Jhula, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand 249192\nLittle Buddha Cafe\nTo witness the stunning city of Rishikesh cinematically unfolding in front of you, Little Buddha Cafe is where you must head. Ideal for large groups, couples and families, this cafe is perched up on the banks of the River Ganga on the Laxman Jhula side. A steep ladder takes you up where you can get seated in your preferred booths. Dishes you must call for your party include Mixed Veg Momos, Buddha Platter, Finger Chips, Thukpa, and the Buddha Special dessert. Take in the charming Ganga River flowing and a 180-degree view of Tapovan and the towering hills.\n- Timings: 8 am to 11 pm (Monday – Sunday)\n- Google rating: 4.0 (over 6.4K Google reviews)\n- Contact: +91 07500758873\n- Address: Laxman Jhula Road, Lakshman Jhula, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand 249302\nShambala Cafe\nSituated just beside the Beatles Cafe is another gem of a Ganga-view cafe in Rishikesh. The Shambala Cafe is perfect to spend a laid-back afternoon and sundowner in the holy city. Nible on fries or fritters and a cup of Nescafé coffee to spend your day mesmerised by the mighty river flowing. Brought alive with colourful paintings, you must remove your shoes to get seated in their open yet cosy seating area with comfy mattresses. You’ll have a melodious time here if you or a fellow traveller picks up a musical instrument from their collection to play their heart out!\n- Timings: 10:30 am to 10 pm (Monday-Sunday)\n- Google rating: 4.1 (780 Google reviews)\n- Contact: +91 09837628348\n- Address: Paidal Marg, Laxman Jhula, Tapovan, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand 249192\nCafe Royale\nThis is an insider recommendation from me, someone who has made Rishikesh their second home. If you’re looking for some personal space away from the crowd and silently enjoy your food, admiring the Ganga River, the Cafe Royale at Laxman Jhula is the eatery for you. Located just a couple of steps from the Little Buddha Cafe, you can start with an artful warm cup of cappuccino as you sit back in the Indian-style mezzanine seating. Designed with the thought of healthy eating and living, you can indulge your taste buds in their smoothie bowls, mixed fruit salad, vegan breakfast, mezze platter, and other unique offerings. Enrich your experience by taking a musical class offered by a guide at the cafe (available upon request and booking).\n- Timings: 8:30 am to 11:30 pm (Monday – Sunday)\n- Google rating: 4.5 (over 1.6K Google reviews)\n- Contact: +91 0135 297 3678\n- Address: Beside River Ganga, Near Gramin Bank, Laxman Jhula Post Office Road, Above Himalayan Travels, Laxman Jhula, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand 249302\n(Feature image credit: Dinal Jain)\nRelated | Plan Your Next Wellness Holiday At These Yoga Retreats\nThe information in this article is accurate as of the date of publication.\nWe may earn an affiliate commission when you shop through links on our site.",
