  "text": "Health may be the greatest wealth, but wellness is the wealthy’s favourite luxury item.\nWhile tens of millions of people in the US have been shocked by skyrocketing healthcare costs, the one percent have been presented with more luxury offerings than ever in pursuit of perfection of mind and body, as well as more time on Earth.\nThose that want a healthy dose of networking along with their additional years can join a surge of new wellness members’ clubs that have opened in cities across the world from London to New York, giving them daily access to services once reserved for resort getaways . While wellness’s main customer continues to be women, the clubs’ chic decor and pilates studios are paired with futuristic infrared contraptions and the language of biohacking and optimisation to capture growing male interest.\nThis rising masculine presence in the industry may also explain why plant-based ingredient trends continue to take a backseat. Erewhon shelves are stocked with bottles of desiccated liver supplements touting the word “primal” and various animal-product based supplements include ingredients like whey protein, collagen and colostrum.\nADVERTISEMENT\nInvestors continue to see the promise of the industry, even if their interests jump from fad to fad. Hormones, fertility and menopause have been areas of focus , with women’s supplement brand Perelel landing $27 million in funding. They’ve also stuck to their love for health-tracking wearables, with Oura Ring now worth $11 billion.\nWhere wellness fits in with the beauty world, however, remains a question with evolving answers : while Ulta Beauty has been all-in on the category, Sephora recently confirmed it’s backing out. But supplements at beauty retailers have proven to be popular in some markets such as South Korea, showing that the potential is there, especially with the imminent global expansion of wellness-heavy K-beauty retailer Olive Young.\nTop Stories 1. The Business of Ballerina Farm . Hannah Neeleman is the farmfluencer who broke the internet thanks to the public’s obsession with her picturesque life, career choices and family dynamics. Now, she is taking her burgeoning lifestyle empire global.\n(Ballerina Farm) 2. Wellness Wants In on the Members Club Boom . A new wave of wellness clubs are cropping up across the world, offering ice baths, optimisation, saunas and socialisation. How big can the trend get?\n(Ian Patterson) 3. Supplements Are Booming. So Is Scepticism. Between class-action lawsuits, safety fears and customer dissatisfaction, the vitamin, supplements and minerals industry is facing more scrutiny than ever. Some sellers see the moment as an opportunity.\n(Shutterstock) 4. Can You Sell Sexual Wellness Without Sex? The once-promising sector is now facing setbacks in the US. As mainstream retailers retreat and social media censorship restricts digital marketing, brands are rethinking their approach to retail partnerships and are finding creative ways to navigate the shift towards cultural conservatism.\n(Hello Cake) 5. The Murky, Expensive World of Longevity, Explained . While there’s no clear consensus on what longevity actually means, companies are cashing in on the ambiguity, profiting from a trend that promises more than it can deliver.\n(Equinox) 6. Beauty’s Great Menopause Conundrum . Over the past half decade, beauty has attempted to ride the menopause wave with mixed results. A new crop of brands is seeking success by embracing hormones, ageing Millennials and telemedicine.\nADVERTISEMENT\n(Alloy/Respin/All Golden) 7. Opinion: How ‘Optimisation’ Hijacked Men’s Wellness . We solved the problem of getting men into wellness. Now we have the bigger problem of what we’ve turned them into, writes meditation teacher Manoj Dias.\n(BoF Team) Subscribe to The Business of Beauty for daily latest news and analysis in makeup, skincare, hair care, fragrance and wellness.",
