  "text": "ACAP data shows strong growth despite the impact of protests in the peak season\nKATHMANDU, JANUARY 1\nForeign tourist arrivals in Mustang, one of Nepal's key religious and trekking destinations, increased by more than 18 percent in 2025, according to the Annapurna Conservation Area Project (ACAP), Jomsom.\nACAP data show that 161,122 foreign tourists visited Mustang between January 1 and December 31, 2025, marking an increase of 25,403 visitors compared to 135,719 tourists in 2024. This represents an overall growth of 18.71 percent year-on-year, said ACAP Jomsom Office Chief Rajesh Gupta.\nOf the total arrivals in 2025, 132,847 tourists were from SAARC countries, while 28,275 came from non-SAARC nations. In 2024, Mustang recorded 109,549 SAARC visitors and 26,170 tourists from other countries.\nCompared to 2024, tourist numbers in 2025 increased by 23,298 from SAARC countries and 2,105 from non-SAARC countries. This translates to a 17.57 percent rise in SAARC arrivals and a 7.44 percent increase from other countries, according to ACAP.\nDespite the overall growth, officials noted that the increase fell short of expectations due to the impact of the Gen Z-led protests on September 23 and 24, which affected tourism during the peak autumn season. ACAP had projected nearly 30 percent growth in foreign arrivals for 2025.\nData show that compared to 2024, foreign tourist numbers declined in September by 3,638, in October by 854, and in November by 70, largely due to disruptions linked to the movement.\nHowever, Gupta said tourist arrivals increased steadily from January to August and again in December, helping offset the decline during the protest-affected months.\nIndian tourists continue to dominate the visitor profile in Mustang. According to ACAP, 82 percent of foreign tourists were from SAARC countries, and over 90 percent of SAARC visitors were Indian nationals, underscoring India's significance as Mustang's largest source market.\n(With inputs from RSS)",
