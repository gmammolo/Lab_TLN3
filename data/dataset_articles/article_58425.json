  "text": "Tourism boom continues as Vietnam welcomes first foreign visitors of 2026 Thursday, January 1, 2026 | 13:49:00 (VOVWORLD) - Many localities across Vietnam on Thursday welcomed their first international visitors of 2026, a year forecast to continue the country’s strong tourism momentum. Ho Chi Minh City welcomes its first foreign visitors in 2026. At Tan Son Nhat International Airport in Ho Chi Minh City, tourists were greeted in a spring-themed setting featuring miniatures of Ben Thanh Market, bright yellow apricot blossoms, chrysanthemums, and the slogan “I Love Vibrant Ho Chi Minh City.” The central city of Da Nang welcomed flights from the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore, bringing more than 1,200 visitors. In 2026, Da Nang is targeting 8.7 million international arrivals. “Welcoming the first flights and visitors at the start of the new year generates fresh momentum and renewed enthusiasm for the city’s tourism to maintain double-digit growth in 2026,” Tan Van Vuong, Deputy Director of the municipal Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism, said. Celebrity Solstice docks at Ha Long International Cruise Port, January 1, 2026. In the northern province of Quang Ninh, more than 3,000 visitors from the UK, the US, Australia, Canada, and Spain arrived on Thursday at Ha Long International Cruise Port aboard the Malta-flagged Celebrity Solstice.
