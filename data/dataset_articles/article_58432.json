  "text": "WARREN COUNTY, OH -- Most people think of January 1 as the New Year. It’s when the Gregorian calendar resets, fireworks go off, resolutions begin and Time's Square drops the Big Ball! But did you know that globally, \"our\" New Year’s Day is not the only New Year's Day?\nNew Year's actually happens again and again throughout the year. Depending on how you define a calendar, there are dozens of New Years celebrated annually around the world.\nWhy New Year Isn’t Just One Day\nA “New Year” occurs whenever a calendar starts counting a new year. The Gregorian calendar is only one of many systems humans use to measure time. Other calendars are based on:\n- The Sun (solar calendars)\n- The Moon (lunar calendars)\n- Both (lunisolar calendars)\nBecause these systems don’t align perfectly with the Gregorian calendar, other New Years fall on different dates, many of which shift slightly each year.\nMajor New Years Celebrated Worldwide\nSome New Years are observed by millions—or even billions—of people:\nThat’s already more than ten distinct New Years, each tied to cultural, religious, or seasonal traditions.\nHindu and Regional New Years\nIndia alone observes multiple New Years, because different regions follow different calendars. Examples include:\n- Ugadi\n- Gudi Padwa\n- Vaisakhi\n- Puthandu\n- Pohela Boishakh\nMany Southeast Asian countries also celebrate their own New Years based on similar calendar systems.\nSo… How Many New Years Are There?\nThere’s no single official number, but when you count:\n- Religious calendars\n- National and cultural calendars\n- Regional variations\n- Historical calendars still used ceremonially\nYou end up with approximately 30–40 or more New Years occurring within one Gregorian year. Some months even host multiple New Years.\nThe Big Picture\n- January 1 is just one New Year\n- New Years are celebrated all year long\n- The concept of “a new year” depends on how a culture measures time\nThus, since the WarrenCountyPost is in the United States of America where we use the Gregorian Calendar.... Please allow us to wish all of you ....\nMore News from Franklin\nTree-rific News!
