  "text": "Sonali Bendre turns 51 today, a milestone that feels almost unbelievable given her radiant presence and calm confidence. Best remembered for films like Sarfarosh, Sonali’s journey over the past few years has been defined not just by her work, but by remarkable resilience. In 2018, she was diagnosed with stage four metastatic cancer and underwent treatment in New York. By 2021, she had made a full recovery and since then, she has been openly advocating regular health check-ups and mindful living. Earlier in 2025, during a casual lunch at her home with filmmaker Farah Khan, Sonali shared one everyday habit that appears to support her health-first lifestyle: eating dinner early. Farah had visited the Behl household with her cooks, Dilip and Laxman, spending time with Sonali and her mother-in-law, Madhu Ramesh Behl. Sonali has been married to filmmaker Goldie Behl since 2002. As the conversation flowed, Sonali mentioned that she prefers wrapping up her dinner by 6:30 or 7 pm. She admitted that staying up late and socialising around food after that feels draining for her. Farah, in turn, joked that she finds it difficult to step out anywhere after eight in the evening, sparking a lighthearted exchange about routines and boundaries. The discussion also touched upon Sonali’s adjustment after marriage. Growing up in a middle-class Maharashtrian household, she found everyday meals in her Punjabi marital home to be as elaborate as wedding feasts. Over time, she has found a balance embracing family traditions while staying mindful of her health and fitness. Science backs this approach. A study published in the July 2021 edition of the Nutrients journal found that late dinners are linked to a higher risk of metabolic dysfunction, including impaired glucose metabolism. Eating earlier in the evening extends the fasting window before the next meal and has been shown to positively impact blood sugar levels, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, and triglycerides particularly in individuals who are overweight or obese. For Sonali, it’s a reminder that recovery and well-being often come down to simple, consistent choices made every day.",
