  "text": "By Brian Ledford ,\n4 hours ago\nVALLEY PARK, Mo. – At Barrel Blends Wine and Spirits, everything happens for a Riesling.\nSales have been climbing during the holidays, especially those seeking spirits prior of the swing of the new year Wednesday night.\n“This particular day and this week, a lot of champagne,” said Joe Ehrhart, a sales associate/bartender at the franchise’s Valley Park location. “Anything with bubbles, people want to pop that top on New Year’s Eve.”\nEhrhart said bourbon and wine purchases are leading the list.\nLIST: New Year’s Eve events around St. Louis Meanwhile, business was heavy at the Schnuck’s Twin Oaks location in Ballwin. Customers claimed party favors that contained plenty of flavors.\n“So crazy!” said shopper Lucy Schnapp. “The lines are so long getting through the stores, you’ve got to navigate your way through all of the people.”\nEhrhart gave his take on making the annual gathering that counts down the clock a success.\n“It’s all about atmosphere,” he said. “You always want good drinks and good music. I think that makes the best kind of party.”\nCopyright 2026 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.
