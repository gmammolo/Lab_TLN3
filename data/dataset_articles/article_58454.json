  "text": "The best cosy and bright fleeces for winter adventures\nThe humble pullover has had a high-fashion makeover, yet it remains a staple for outdoor pursuits. Seasoned hikers share their go-to styles to lighten up the grey days\nCosy and nostalgic, the humble fleece has long been a staple for hikers and dog walkers, but in the past couple of years, it’s undergone a fashion upgrade.\nLuxury labels like Miu Miu have reimagined the fuzzy jacket as a covetable, catwalk-ready design, as seen on the likes of Emma Corrin and Lily Allen, while Scandi brands such as Cecilie Bahnsen and Stine Goya are delivering elevated takes on the look.",
