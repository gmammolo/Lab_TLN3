  "text": "As we prepare to hit the “restart” button on the calendar and ring in 2026, we wanted to take a moment to look back at an incredible year and send our warmest wishes to the entire Geeky Gadgets community.\n2025 has been a landmark year for mobile technology. We’ve witnessed the arrival of the iPhone 17 Pro Max with its stunning 48MP triple-lens “Fusion” array and that incredible 8x optical zoom.1 But perhaps the biggest conversation starter of the year was the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Z Trifold, which finally brought the dream of a 10-inch tablet that fits in your pocket to life with its dual-hinge design. It’s been a year where the boundaries between phone, tablet, and PC have blurred more than ever before.\nA Fresh Boot for 2026\nWhether you’re spending your New Year’s Eve unboxing a new device, setting up your iOS 26 widgets, or exploring the multitasking power of Android 16 on a triple-folding screen, we hope your celebrations are fantastic.\nAs we look ahead to 2026, the tech horizon remains incredibly bright. We’re already hearing rumors about the next phase of “Agentic AI” that will make our devices even more proactive, and we can’t wait to see how the competition heats up in the wearable and smart home spaces. Whatever the “Next Big Thing” is, we’ll be right here to break it down for you.\nThank You for Being Part of the Journey\nGeeky Gadgets wouldn’t be the same without your insight, your curiosity, and your shared passion for innovation. Whether you’ve been with us since our first post or joined us this year to track the latest iPhone leaks, we are truly grateful to have you in our community.\nMay your 2026 be filled with high speeds, low latency, and plenty of new gear. We look forward to exploring the future of technology with you!\nHappy New Year from all of us here at the Geeky Gadgets team!\nCheers,\nThe Geeky Gadgets Team\nGeeky Stuff\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\nDisclosure: Some of our articles include affiliate links.
