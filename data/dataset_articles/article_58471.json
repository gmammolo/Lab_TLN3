  "text": "Chattooga County is set to ring in New Year’s Day 2026 with a mix of outdoor recreation and local tradition, giving families and visitors a chance to start the year on a positive note.\nAt James H. “Sloppy” Floyd State Park , the annual First Day Hikes are scheduled for Thursday, January 1, 2026 , with a 10:00 a.m. start time. Participants can choose from a range of trail options, from easy walks to more challenging routes, offering a scenic way to begin 2026 with fresh air, movement, and time outdoors.\nFollowing the hikes, the Friends of James H. “Sloppy” Floyd State Park plan to host a Black-Eyed Pea Luncheon from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at Picnic Shelter 4 . The meal continues a Southern New Year tradition many associate with good luck and prosperity heading into the new year.\nWhether residents choose to hit the trails, enjoy a warm meal, or simply spend time with neighbors and family, New Year’s Day in Chattooga County offers a community-focused start to 2026.",
