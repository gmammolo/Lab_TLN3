Love that. But January has a way of making people feel behind before anything even happens. if you’re sitting there feeling like you don’t have your life together, pause for a second. (sic).\"\nShe advised all to treat themselves with the same level of empathy they would show to a friend who is feeling overwhelmed and confused.\n\"If a friend came to you with the thoughts you’re having right now, you wouldn’t judge them. You’d soften your voice. You’d tell them to breathe. You’d remind them they’re not broken, behind, or failing,\" added Anshula.\n'The Traitors' contestant also reminded us all to \"offer yourself that same kindness & turn that compassion inwards. Not every year needs a big reinvention. Not every January needs a master plan.\"\nAnshula claimed that at times, the bravest thing one can do is to just show up as they are and be gentler with oneself.\nAnshula, who turned a year older on December 29, expressed gratitude for all the lovely birthday wishes she received on her special day.\nShe wrote, “A year older, a little wiser, very blessed. Thank you to everyone for all the birthday love and wishes. Stepping into the next chapter with gratitude and cake (sic).”\nAnshula further dropped glimpses from her birthday celebration with brother Arjun Kapoor, sister Khushi Kapoor, fiancé Rohan Thakkar, and other members of the family.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",
