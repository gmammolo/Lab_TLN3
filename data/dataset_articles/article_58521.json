  "text": "DEAR READERS: Welcome to 2026! A New Year has arrived; the last one is safely behind us. As always, this New Year brings with it our hopes for a new beginning.\nToday presents an opportunity to discard destructive old habits for healthy new ones, and with that in mind, I will share Dear Abby's often-requested list of New Year's Resolutions -- which were adapted by my late mother, Pauline Phillips, from the original credo of Al-Anon:\nJUST FOR TODAY: I will live through THIS DAY ONLY. I will not brood about yesterday or obsess about tomorrow. I will not set far-reaching goals or try to overcome all of my problems at once. I know that I can do something for 24 hours that would overwhelm me if I had to keep it up for a lifetime.\nJUST FOR TODAY: I will decide to be happy. I will not dwell on thoughts that depress me. If my mind fills with clouds, I will chase them away and fill it with sunshine.\nJUST FOR TODAY: I will accept what is. I will face reality. I will correct those things that I can correct and accept those I cannot.\nJUST FOR TODAY: I will improve my mind. I will read something that requires effort, thought and concentration. I will not be a mental loafer.\nJUST FOR TODAY: I will make a conscious effort to be agreeable. I will be kind and courteous to those who cross my path, and I'll not speak ill of others. I will improve my appearance, speak softly and not interrupt when someone else is talking. Just for today, I will refrain from improving anybody but myself.\nJUST FOR TODAY: I will do something positive to improve my health. If I'm a smoker, I'll quit. And I will get off the couch and take a brisk walk, even if it's only around the block.\nJUST FOR TODAY: I will gather the courage to do what is right and take responsibility for my own actions.\nAnd now, Dear Readers, allow me to share an item that was sent to me by L.J. Bhatia, a reader from New Delhi, India:\nDEAR ABBY: This year, no resolutions, only some guidelines. The Holy Vedas say, \"Man has subjected himself to thousands of self-inflicted bondages. Wisdom comes to a man who lives according to the true eternal laws of nature.\"\nThe prayer of St. Francis (of which there are several versions) contains a powerful message:\nLord, make me an instrument of your peace;\nWhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nWhere there is injury, pardon;\nWhere there is doubt, faith;\n Where there is despair, hope;\nWhere there is darkness, light;\nAnd where there is sadness, joy.\nO Divine Master,\nGrant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console;\nTo be understood, as to understand;\nTo be loved, as to love;\nFor it is in giving that we receive,\nIt is in pardoning that we are pardoned,\nAnd it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.\nAnd so, Dear Readers, may 2026 bring with it good health, peace and joy to all of us. -- LOVE, ABBY\n===",
