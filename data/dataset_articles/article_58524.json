  "text": "By DPA ,\nnow\nHundreds of thousands of people welcomed the New Year with fireworks and music in the Brazilian coastal metropolis of Rio de Janeiro.\nAt midnight (0300 GMT), a 12-minute fireworks display began, launched from 19 rafts off the beach in the Copacabana district.\nHundreds of drones hovered above the revellers, forming pictures in the night sky. Bands, musicians and DJs performed on numerous stages on Copacabana beach.\nThe city administration expected 5 million visitors to attend the celebrations throughout the city and revenues for hoteliers, restaurants, bars and tourism companies amounting to 3.34 billion reais ($610 million).\nOn Tuesday, Rio de Janeiro was recognized by the Guinness Book of Records as the metropolis with the largest New Year's Eve party in the world. The city administration was able to prove that 2.5 million people had celebrated in front of the main stage on Copacabana alone at the turn of the year 2024-25.",
