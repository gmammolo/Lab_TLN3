  "text": "HCMC – Quang Ninh Province welcomed its first international cruise ship of 2026 on January 1, marking a positive start to the new year for the local tourism sector. The Celebrity Solstice, flying the Maltese flag, arrived at Halong International Cruise Port in Bai Chay Ward at 10:30 a.m. on December 31, 2025. The vessel carried 3,016 passengers, mainly from the UK, the U.S., Australia, Canada and Spain. After an overnight stay, the ship was scheduled to depart on the evening of January 1, continuing its voyage to Hong Kong after departing from Thailand.\nProvincial leaders organized a formal welcome ceremony on the morning of January 1. Quang Ninh Party Secretary Quan Minh Cuong presented flowers to cruise passengers and extended New Year greetings to the first international visitors to Halong Bay in 2026.\nSpeaking at the event, Cuong said Quang Ninh aims to become one of Vietnam’s leading tourism hubs and a regional gateway for international tourism cooperation. The province is pursuing a development strategy focused on green growth, the circular economy and a “four-season tourism” model.\nHe added that Quang Ninh is prioritizing investment in tourism infrastructure and spatial planning to strengthen connectivity within the province and with regional and international markets. Tourism is identified as a key economic driver, supporting sustainable growth while preserving cultural heritage and natural ecosystems.\nMany visitors expressed positive impressions of their arrival. Alfonso Delgado, a tourist from Madrid, said he was impressed by the warm reception and described Ha Long Bay as a memorable destination to start the new year, citing its scenery, pleasant weather and local cuisine. A group of visitors from Mexico also praised the hospitality and the beauty of the bay.\nIn 2025, Quang Ninh received more than 60 international cruise calls, bringing over 90,000 foreign passengers to Halong. The province exceeded its annual tourism target, welcoming more than 21 million visitors, compared with the original goal of 20 million, including 4.5 million international arrivals. Tourism revenue was estimated at VND57–58 trillion, supported by promotion campaigns, new tourism products and major cultural, sports and culinary events.\nFor 2026, Quang Ninh expects more than 70 international cruise ships with over 100,000 passengers to dock at Halong. The province targets 22 million tourist arrivals, including 5.2 million international visitors, with tourism revenue projected at around VND65 trillion.\nTo meet these goals, Quang Ninh plans to expand international tourism promotion, strengthen cooperation with overseas partners and attract investment in high-quality, green and sustainable tourism projects. The province will also continue developing air routes via Van Don International Airport, expanding sea-based tourism, diversifying tourism products and hosting large-scale cultural and entertainment events.",
