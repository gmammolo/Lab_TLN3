  "text": "An expert trainer in her late 40s says this is the exact weekly workout she does to help her “feel energized, not exhausted”\nKate Rowe-Ham breaks down what a recent week of workouts looks like\nFeatures\n0\nFollow us\nNewsletter\nWelcome to Workout Diaries, a series where we ask expert trainers to talk us through what a week of exercise looks like for them, helping you figure out how to develop and maintain an effective workout routine.\nAs a women's health coach and menopause specialist, Kate Rowe-Ham knows that regular, varied exercise is important to aging well.\nBut as a busy mom of three running her own business, she also knows that time is a luxury.\nThat's why she anchors her morning with 30-45 minute sessions of strength training, cardio or mobility work.\n“My workouts are designed to help me feel energized, not exhausted,” she says. “I want to walk away feeling strong, not punished.”\nShe tries to train five times a week, prioritizing movement that will help future-proof her body.\nBelow, she shares her weekly workout diary and her top tips for creating a sustainable exercise routine.\nStart your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.\nKate Rowe-Ham is a trainer and women's health specialist. She’s also the founder of the Owning Your Menopause app and author of Owning Your Menopause: Fitter, Calmer, Stronger in 30 Days. Her forthcoming book, The Longevity Solution, goes on sale in 2026.\nKate’s weekly workout routine\nMonday 6am\nUpper-body workout\nTuesday 6am\nHIIT\nWednesday 6am\nLower-body workout\nThursday 6am\nFull-body workout\nFriday 6am\nStretch\nSaturday 10am\nCore and upper-body workout\nSunday\nLong walk/ rest day\nKate Rowe-Ham's top workout tips\n1. Start small and prioritize consistency\nRather than setting yourself up for failure with unrealistic goals, focus on achievable targets and make sustainable changes.\n“Start small, stay consistent, and build from there,\" says Rowe-Ham.\nTry adding movement to your day with regular walks or aim for a few 15-minute workouts a week.\n“Don’t overcomplicate it—your body craves movement, not perfection,” says the trainer.\n2. Focus on how exercise makes you feel\nHaving unrealistic workout goals won't help you stick to your exercise plan, but forming daily habits that improve your mood and energy levels will.\n“When you link movement to your energy, mood and long-term health, it becomes less about willpower and more about self-respect,” says Rowe-Ham.\n“Focus on strength, balance and feeling good, and let that be your why.”\n3. Don't despair if you go off track\nWhile it's good to be consistent, it's also important to let yourself off the hook if you slip up and adapt plans as needed.\n“Life happens! I’ve learned not to beat myself up when things don’t go as planned,” says Rowe-Ham.\n“The key is to have a flexible mindset: if I can’t get a full session in, I’ll go for a walk, stretch or do a 15-minute mini workout at home.”\n4. Pick the right time\nRowe-Ham says she's a morning person, so she likes to exercise first thing, as it sets a positive tone for her day.\nHowever, that doesn't mean you have to stick to this routine.\n“I always tell women to work with their bodies, not against them.\n“If mornings feel overwhelming, choose a time that suits your rhythm and lifestyle. The best time to work out is the time you’ll actually do it.”\nMaddy Biddulph is a journalist specializing in fitness, health and wellbeing content, with 26 years in consumer media working as a writer and editor for some of the bestselling newspapers, magazines and websites in the US and UK, including Marie Claire, The Sunday Times and Women’s Health UK.\nShe is a CIMPSA-certified PT and works one-on-one with clients, as well as running Circuits Club classes which mixes cardio and strength training and chair-based exercise classes for seniors.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.",
