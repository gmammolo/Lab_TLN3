Aviation safety is “built through vigilance and constant advancement,” and “each layer of protection exists for a reason.” Congress “must strengthen — not stall — the proven safety practices that protect passengers and crews every day.”\nThe Week\nEscape your echo chamber.

China “measures economic competition relentlessly,” but the U.S. “relies on backward-looking indicators such as trade balances and foreign direct investment flows.” Those “still matter, but they capture only a fraction of how power is built in a digital economy.” The U.S. “needs modern economic intelligence to match modern economic statecraft.”\n‘“Looksmaxxing” young men are carving up their faces. Being ugly is a lot easier.’\nDave Schilling at The Guardian\nWithin the “fetid petri dish that we call the internet, looksmaxxing has taken hold with a subsection of otherwise functioning individuals,” says Dave Schilling. To “be a looksmaxxer is to purposefully carve up your face, inject steroids into any willing orifice, and occasionally using crystal meth to suppress your appetite.” Trying to “chase perfection is difficult, requires thousands and thousands of dollars of disposable income, and hurts quite a bit.” That “sort of perfection is not actually possible.”\n‘Trump’s Greenland pursuit has left NATO damaged’\nGregory W. Slayton and Sergei Ivashenko at the National Review\nNATO is the “most successful military alliance in the history of the world,” say Gregory W. Slayton and Sergei Ivashenko. President Donald Trump’s “recent threats to annex Greenland have broken this trust.” NATO allies are “now talking about a NATO without its cornerstone — that is, without America. That is a road we, as Westerners and as Americans, do not want to go down.” If “America First really means America Alone, our nation’s and our world’s future is bleak.”\nJustin Klawans has worked as a staff writer at The Week since 2022.
