  "text": "Telangana has rich liquor consumption history, and this was on a scintillating display in the month of December as record sales were registered last month. The occasion of new year and the subsequent panchayat elections largely contributed to the liquor sales all over the state.\nAccording to the latest media reports, liquor sales in Telangana have created a brand-new record as it is established that in the month of December 2025, liquor worth a whopping Rs. 5,102 crore was sold.\nWith the addition of New Year celebrations and the recent sarpanch elections earlier this month, liquor sales reached an unexpectedly high level.\nNotably, sales of around Rs. 750 crore occurred just on December 30 and 31 which coincides with the new year occasion and celebratory spirit.\nExcise officials have stated that the introduction of various brands due to the new liquor policy also contributed to this massive revenue. Nevertheless, Telangana has again exceeded expectations with regard to liquor consumption on the occasion of New Year.\nTags Liquor sales",
