  "text": "6 of the best ever Blue Peter makes, from the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s, to take you back to your childhood\n- Blue Peter has been running for more than 66 years\n- During that time, its presenters have shown viewers how to make an extraordinary range of items\n- Below are some of the best Blue Peter ‘makes’ from down the decades\nDuring its remarkable 66-year run, Blue Peter has proved there is nothing you can’t do with some sticky-back plastic, an empty washing-up bottle, a few old coat hangers and a bit of imagination.\nBetween them, the show’s many presenters have shown children across the UK how to craft all manner of objects from items that would otherwise have ended up in the bin.\nAdvertisement\nHide Ad\nAdvertisement\nHide Ad\nIt’s fair to say that some of the programme’s legendary ‘makes’ have been more impressive than others.\nBelow are five of Blue Peter’s best-ever crafting projects, and one of the strangest, from presenters including Valerie Singleton, Janet Ellis and Anthea Turner.\nOne has gone down in legend, another was a serious fire risk, and a third was out of this world.\nDo you remember any of these Blue Peter ‘makes’, and did you try them yourself? If not, it’s not too late to give it a go.\nAdvertisement\nHide Ad\nAdvertisement\nHide Ad\nBlake’s Seven teleporter bracelet\nThe sci-fi classic Blake’s Seven was one of the most popular TV programmes of the late 70s and early 80s, when many children dreamed of owning one of the teleporter bracelets worn by the crew of the Scorpio.\nIn 1983, Blue Peter presenter Janet Ellis showed youngsters how to make their own teleporter using only an old margarine tub, card, paper, buttons, ribbon, silver paint and glue.\nThere was nothing like it in the shops at the time, it cost just 40p to make and it looked pretty impressive, perhaps better even than the show’s notoriously dodgy sets. How long it would last is another matter.\nDougal shoulder bag\nThe Magic Roundabout was perhaps the most iconic children’s TV show of the 60s and 70s, and Dougal was its most beloved character.\nAdvertisement\nHide Ad\nAdvertisement\nHide Ad\nSo it’s no surprise the world-weary Skye terrier ended up featuring on a classic Blue Peter make in 1973.\nLesley Judd showed young viewers how to make a stylish Dougal shoulder bag, using a strip of denim, yellow felt for his shaggy fur, some glue and a needle and thread.\nOnly basic sewing skills were required, and the plaited shoulder strap made it one of the more stylish, practical and durable of Blue Peter makes.\nTracy Island\nThis was the mother of all Blue Peter makes.\nTracy Island, the secret hideaway of the Thunderbirds, was one of the most coveted toys in Christmas 1992.\nAdvertisement\nHide Ad\nAdvertisement\nHide Ad\nMany shops sold out and if you were lucky enough to find one it would cost you £34.99 - equivalent to around £78 today.\nThankfully, Blue Peter presenter Anthea Turner came to the rescue of parents everywhere by showing youngsters how they could make their own version for next to nothing.\nIt was one of the show’s most ambitious makes, and the list of materials required was extensive, even if they were mostly things you could get for free.\nBut the end result was seriously impressive, and the BBC was flooded with requests for copies of the instruction sheet after the show aired in January 1993.\nAdvertisement\nHide Ad\nAdvertisement\nHide Ad\nIt was the small details that made this such an impressive build, like the sandpaper beaches, the sawdust mixed with paint to create the grass, and the pipe cleaner palm trees.\nThis was one of the stranger Blue Peter makes, but if it got just one child to tidy up after themself, any parent would surely say it was worth it.\nYvette Fielding showed viewers how to make their own ‘revolting Beastie box’ to ‘gobble up all your mess’ in the 90s.\nAll you needed was a grocery box, some sticky-back plastic, an old loo roll to make the googly eyes, an empty yoghurt pot for the fangs, and some wool for the fur.\nAdvertisement\nHide Ad\nAdvertisement\nHide Ad\nIt might have helped encourage youngsters to keep their rooms clean, but how many parents were left cleaning up the mess their children had created making the spooky container.\nAdvent crown\nThis was a perennial favourite Blue Peter make, rolled out year after year at Christmas time.\nThe Advent crown featured four candles, one to be lit each week in the run-up to Christmas, in the days before most children had a chocolate Advent calendar.\nIt was first made in the 60s by Peter Trace, using wire coat hangers, tinsel and peppercorn jar lids as the drip trays for the candles.\nAdvertisement\nHide Ad\nAdvertisement\nHide Ad\nIt wasn’t the most beautiful of Christmas decorations, it looked alarmingly flimsy, and, with real candles, it was a serious fire hazard, but it was popular nonetheless.\nIf you are thinking of making this one, it would be wise to swap the real candles for some LED ones.\nDalek cake\nBlue Peter presenters have shown viewers how to make numerous Doctor Who-inspired projects over the years, with the Time Lord’s greatest nemeses, the Daleks, featuring frequently.\nOne of the most inventive creations was the Dalek cake made by Valerie Singleton in 1966, using a swiss roll, some chocolate icing, cocktail sticks, liquorice, sweets and a glacé cherry.\nAdvertisement\nHide Ad\nAdvertisement\nHide Ad\nThe finished product was a bit wonky, and certainly less menacing than the real thing, but it also looked delicious.\nFor more children’s television nostalgia, check out this look back at memorable TV puppets you’ll only remember if you grew up in the 80s or 90s.",
