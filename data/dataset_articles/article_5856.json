  "text": "Jan. 29, 2026\nCOON VALLEY Wis. — Vernon County Sheriff Roy Torgerson said deputies acted quickly and deliberately Tuesday night as a volatile situation involving a Hillsboro resident escalated into a multijurisdictional response and an eventual arrest.\nTorgerson said the department anticipated difficulties after serving a Temporary Restraining Order earlier in the day and made preparations to protect everyone involved.\n“Deputies received information that raised concerns about how Witaker might react to receiving the order and we took proactive steps to monitor the situation and communicate with the protected person and other potential victims,” said Torgerson. “Everyone’s safety is the ultimate goal.”\nThe sheriff said the first warning came around 7:30 p.m. when dispatchers received a report that the individual at the center of the case was making disturbing comments in the Hillsboro area. An officer from the Hillsboro Police Department responded immediately providing communication support to Vernon County deputies.\n“This teamwork and rapid coordination proved vital,” said Torgerson. “Their response created a critical link that assisted our deputies.”\nShortly afterward deputies were told the individual had left a residence in Hillsboro in a dark gray vehicle. Given earlier intelligence deputies anticipated possible destinations and sent an officer to a rural Coon Valley area believed to be involved. While that deputy was positioning to protect potential victims dispatchers received another report describing a similar vehicle driving in the dark without headlights near the same area. Additional officers moved into the region even as the first deputy remained at the residence to safeguard those inside.\nThe situation intensified when dispatchers received a 911 call at 8:22 p.m. from someone claiming to be inside a residence and in need of help. The caller did not provide an address but mapping data placed the phone near the road where the deputy was already stationed. Torgerson later confirmed the caller was the suspect using an alias.\n“It was later determined that Witaker was the caller,” said Torgerson. “He had provided a different name.”\nAt 8:30 p.m. deputies located the individual on foot near a dark gray vehicle that had been parked on a town road. A struggle followed.\n“Witaker resisted arrest and a physical confrontation ensued but deputies were able to take him into custody,” said Torgerson. “He was found in possession of a large knife.”\nThe sheriff said two officers one a Vernon County deputy and one a Westby police officer were injured during the arrest. Both received medical treatment and were later released from care.\n“I empathize with everyone involved,” said Torgerson. “Officers receive extensive training in tactical decision making but there are situations when they must act immediately regardless of the dangers.”\nAuthorities transported the individual to the Vernon County Detention Center on multiple charges including harassment fear of death or injunction stalking violation of a restraining order resisting or obstructing an officer battery to a law enforcement officer bail jumping attempted possession of a firearm contrary to injunction and carrying a concealed weapon without a permit.\nThe individual appeared in court Wednesday where Vernon County Judge Timothy J. Gaskell set bond at one hundred thousand dollars. No bail had been posted at the time of the release. The case will proceed with formal charges sought through the Vernon County District Attorney’s Office.\nThe Sheriff emphasized that “A charge is merely an accusation. Witaker is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.”\nTorgerson acknowledged the multiple agencies that responded including officers from Hillsboro Westby and Viroqua the Gundersen Tri State Ambulance service and investigators from the Wisconsin Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigation.\n“I am extremely grateful for the professionalism teamwork and excellent communication that brought this situation to a safe conclusion,” said Torgerson. “Our community’s support means everything.”",
