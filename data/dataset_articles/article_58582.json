  "text": "New year, new fun in Cape Coral\nBY MELISSA MICKEY, CITY OF CAPE CORAL COMMUNICATIONS MANGER\nSPECIAL TO FLORIDA WEEKLY\n|\n|\nCape Coral is starting the new year in style, with a January calendar full of celebrations, art, outdoor fun, and community spirit. It’s the perfect time for residents and visitors alike to get outside, explore local events, and enjoy everything Cape Coral has to offer after the hustle and bustle of the holidays.\nRinging in the New Year\nThe excitement begins with the City’s New Year’s Eve celebration, a lively way to say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one in the heart of Cape Coral. Families, friends, and neighbors can gather to enjoy music, food and festive activities as they count down together. The atmosphere is relaxed and fun, with something for all ages, from kids who love the lights and sounds to adults who appreciate a cheerful night out close to home.\nCape Coral Art Festival\nOne of January’s biggest highlights is the Cape Coral Art Festival, a signature event that draws tens of thousands of people to the city each year. Although it is not organized by the City of Cape Coral, it has become an important part of the community’s cultural identity. This year’s festival will take place on Jan. 10 and 11, when Cape Coral Parkway will be closed to vehicle traffic and transformed into a vibrant outdoor gallery lined with booths featuring artists from near and far.\nVisitors can stroll the parkway, browse paintings, photography, ceramics, jewelry, and more, and often meet the artists in person.\nTour de Cape\nFor those who prefer to start the year in motion, Tour de Cape offers a fun and active way to explore the city. This popular event brings together cyclists and runners of all ages and abilities, with routes and distances designed to be enjoyable rather than intimidating. It is less about competition and more about community, health and seeing Cape Coral from a different perspective.\nParticipants can ride or run through scenic parts of the city, enjoying the mild winter weather and flat terrain that makes Southwest Florida so appealing for outdoor activity. Whether someone is an experienced cyclist or just dusting off a bike after a long break, Tour de Cape provides a welcoming, energetic atmosphere to kick off those New Year wellness goals.\nEvery day fun around the city\nBeyond the events, January is simply a wonderful time to enjoy everyday life in Cape Coral. Mild temperatures make it ideal for visiting local parks, skateboarding at Eagle Skate Park, taking a clinic at the Cape Coral BMX track, or exploring our recreation facilities.\nResidents and visitors should also make time for Sunset Fest, a free, family-friendly event at Four Freedoms Park on Jan. 7 from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. at 4818 Tarpon Court, offering a relaxing way to enjoy the waterfront and the evening sky.\nFor information on events or to sign up for a class at one of our recreation facilities, visit Capecoral.gov.",
