  "text": "Kajol and Ajay Devgn celebrated New Year with friends and family. The actress also shared happy photos from the intimate celebration, offering fans a glimpse into her New Year moments. Along with the pictures, Kajol penned a heartfelt message for fans. Taking to her Instagram handle, Kajol shared three photos giving a glimpse of her celebration with Ajay Devgn and other close friends. She also penned a note for fans, calling life precious. “Happy new year to one and all.. as we have seen in this past year life is precious and unpredictable.. so live it like it means something.\" Fans also reacted and wished the same. Take a look here: Kajol Shares BTS Video With Her From The Sets Recently, the actress took to her Instagram, and shared a BTS video from one of the brand shoots. In the video, the actress can be seen having a great time with her mother, Tanuja. She wrote in the caption, “2025 is nearly over and this I have to say was the highlight of my year. Me and my mom on a set together realising how the madness is doubled nothing is too much\". Kajol’s quirky nature has always set her apart in Bollywood. Unfiltered, spontaneous, and refreshingly honest, she has never tried to fit into the industry’s polished mould. Whether it’s her candid interviews, playful banter on reality shows, or hilarious social media posts, Kajol’s humour feels effortless and real. She laughs loudly, speaks her mind, and embraces her imperfections with confidence.
