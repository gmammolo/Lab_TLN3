  "text": "Drink this daily to help firm your skin\nDid you know that there is one of the simplest ways to maintain skin tone and firmness - without expensive treatments?\nRBC-Ukraine explains which juice can help make your skin firmer.\nWhy citrus fruits are good for the skin\nOranges, grapefruits, and lemons are powerful sources of vitamin C, which is essential for collagen synthesis. This protein is responsible for the skin’s elasticity and firmness. Without it, facial contours lose definition, and the skin loses density.\nIn addition, citrus fruits contain bioflavonoids - antioxidant compounds that strengthen blood vessels and improve microcirculation. Potassium and so-called structured water found in these fruits help maintain fluid and electrolyte balance, making the skin look more hydrated and smoother.\nMost commonly noticed effects\nAccording to research, people who regularly drink citrus juice with pulp report improved skin elasticity and a fresher-looking complexion. This effect is linked to reduced moisture loss through the epidermis, increased collagen production, and improved blood circulation.\nExperts emphasize that citrus juice works on multiple skin-aging mechanisms at once, delivering a comprehensive approach to skin health.\nHow to make citrus juice with pulp\nFor maximum benefit, it’s best to prepare a semi-clear juice with added pulp. You’ll need two oranges, half a pink grapefruit, and one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.\nAdding a few spoonfuls of pulp and a drop of olive oil or grapeseed oil helps improve the absorption of beneficial nutrients.\nAn alternative option is to blend the fruit with a small amount of water and a slice of ginger. The result is a nectar-like drink rich in soluble fiber.\nWhen and how to drink it\nThe optimal time is in the morning or the first half of the day, after a light protein-and-fat breakfast, such as yogurt or eggs. The drink is best consumed through a glass or metal straw to reduce the impact of acidity on tooth enamel.\nAfterward, it’s recommended to rinse your mouth with water and wait at least 30 minutes before brushing your teeth.\nWho it’s suitable for - and who should be cautious\nThis citrus routine is especially beneficial for dull skin, early signs of wrinkles, and a tendency toward redness.\nAt the same time, people with acid reflux, high stomach acidity, gallstone disease, or active rosacea should start with small amounts and carefully monitor their body’s response.\nIf you take medications that interact with grapefruit, it’s best to exclude this fruit from the recipe.",
