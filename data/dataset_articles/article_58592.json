  "text": "Capture the Clearwater Claus has been fun and we enjoyed seeing all the smiling faces of the winners. Chamber of Commerce members around the county volunteered to participate in this holiday event, providing a prize to each winner. The Claus visited Lauria’s ‘Old Museum’ Antiques & Gifts, House of JuJu Orofino, O-Town Mugs & Grubs, Pierce Community Center, Elk Snout in Pierce, Clearwater Memorial Public Library Orofino, Potlatch #1 Financial Credit Union Orofino, Back Country Trading Post, Summer Garden Gate, Tom’s Tavern Elk River, Wild Hare Fabrics, Inland Cellular Orofino, Discovery Center Weippe, Fiesta En Jalisco #1 Orofino, and the Log Inn Elk River.\nThe Storefront Lighting Display contest has come to an end with the following winners: 1st place to O-Town Mugs & Grubs, 2nd Presnell Gage and 3rd Clearwater Apothecary. Thank you to all the businesses who decorated for the holiday season.\nOur towns would not be so festive without your participation.\nThe Chamber is glad to help make the holiday season brighter by hosting these activities along with the Old Fashion Christmas Festival & Light Parade. Your participation helps to keep the event going each year. All of this is possible through donations, annual fundraising and volunteer efforts.\nContributions are welcomed and will be used to purchase lights for the community wreaths, snowflakes and decorations for the area parks.\nPlease consider joining us next year by partnering with the Clearwater County Chamber of Commerce.\nContact us at 208-476-4335 or 6cdirector@gmail.com and follow our social media and website at ClearwaterCountyAdventures.com.",
