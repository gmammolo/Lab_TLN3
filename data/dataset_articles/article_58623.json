  "text": "After seven years of intense travel as a photographer, this is what I pack and why it works better than all that influencer nonsense\nFeatures\nBenedict Brainpublished\nPeople are obsessed with know what camera and photo gear I use – well here is exactly what I pack on my worldwide adventures…\n0\nFollow us\nAfter seven years of near constant travel, this is the kit I carry and why it works better for me than any influencer-driven packing lists. I am not a gear obsessive and, if I am brutally honest, most camera reviews leave me cold, apologies to my esteemed comrades who write them.\nThe endless question I get of what camera I use misses the point. Still, I do care deeply about tools. I use the best equipment I can afford because image quality matters when you make large gallery prints. Weight matters too. I walk cities for hours, and every gram counts. My aim is simple. Forget the kit quickly and focus on looking.\nThat said, since most people ask the question, so this is what I pack and why. It works for me.\nFujifilm GFX100RF\nFor me, the ultimate travel camera (so far). Medium format quality in a compact body with beautiful tone and colour. I have spent 30 years thinking about the ideal travel camera, and this comes closest. Occasionally, I miss a longer reach lens, but overall, it is spot on.\nArtisan & Artist silk camera strap (red)\nPossibly an indulgence, but the silk is so flexible, comfortable and versatile. It wraps around the hand, works cross-body and can be shortened with a quick knot for shoulder carry.\nFujifilm X100V (backup)\nMy backup camera. It rarely comes out, but I like knowing it is there.\nGodox V1 flashgun\nThe way I travel gives me little control over time, light or when and where I am. I have to react to what I get. Flash adds consistency, but more than that, I like the aesthetic of strong fill flash.\nThe best camera deals, reviews, product advice, and unmissable photography news, direct to your inbox!\nGodox XPro wireless flash trigger\nUseful in theory for helping me ‘shape’ light. In practice, it is unreliable and drives me nuts. If a simple cable existed, I would use that instead.\nWandrd PRVKE Lite camera backpack\nWell-made, slick and stylish. Mainly used to get a kit through airports and all the other hurdles associated with long-haul travel. I only work from it when hiking. On city streets, it stays put.\nBillingham shoulder bag\nNearly 30 years old and still going strong. Perfect size for the Fujifilm GFX100RF and accessories. Originally bought for a Contax G1 system. The benefits of a shoulder bag are numerous, but quick access and being able to swing it to the front of my body swiftly are the most crucial reasons, especially in crowded cities.\nGitzo Traveller travel tripod (sometimes)\nPacked occasionally and used rarely. Airport security can be suspicious, so it often goes in checked luggage.\nManfrotto pocket tripod (always)\nUsed mainly to hold my iPhone for behind-the-scenes footage. But it’ll hold the Fujfilm GFX100RF easily.\niPhone 17 Pro\nAn essential tool for notes, remote triggering and capturing broadcast-quality behind-the-scenes video. It’s also a pretty impressive photography tool in its own right.\nRode tieclip microphones\nSmall, effective and mainly used with my iPhone for good clean audio.\nLaCie Rugged portable SSD\nEssential for backing up on the move. Reliable and tough. I'll back up as soon as I get back to my room. I do not format cards until I’m back in the UK, so that anytime I always have at least two copies of all files.\nSD cards\nAround twelve 128 GB Lexar cards. I work slowly and deliberately, so speed is not critical.\nSD card cases x2\nOne for full cards, one for formatted cards ready to use.\nSpare batteries\nAt least one fully charged spare for the camera and flash. Enough for a full day.\nMacBook Pro M4\nFor backing up and editing on the go, and just about everything else needed to work as a freelance creative on the go, I can't quite bring myself to say ‘digital nomad’, but you get the drift.\nCables and chargers\nMost of my kit is now USB-C, which simplifies life massively. I also carry a selection of world travel adapters.\nA roll of electrical tape\nI never leave home without it, and nor should any other self-respecting photographer. Gaffer tape is good too, but too large to travel with. I don't think there’s been a trip when I haven't used electrical tape for something.\nNotebook and pencil\nI wish I were a better journaler or diarist, but I’m not. However, a notebook is useful, especially for making a note of the names or people I photograph along with their contact details. I also carry business cards to give to people I photograph.\nBenedict Brain is a UK based photographer, journalist and artist. He graduated with a degree in photography from the Derby School of Art in 1991 (now University of Derby), where he was tutored and inspired by photographers John Blakemore and Olivier Richon, amongst others. He is an Associate of the Royal Photographic Society and also sits on the society’s Distinctions Advisory Panel.\nUntil July 2018 Benedict was editor of Britain’s best-selling consumer photography magazine, Digital Camera Magazine. As a journalist he met and interviewed some of the world’s greatest photographers and produced articles on a wide range of photography related topics, presented technique videos, wrote in-depth features, curated and edited best-in-class content for a range of titles including; Amateur Photographer, PhotoPlus, N-Photo, Professional Photography and Practical Photoshop. He currently writes a regular column, The Art of Seeing, for Digital Camera magazine.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.",
