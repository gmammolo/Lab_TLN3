  "text": "By Sreeja Banik ,\n1 hours ago\nRoger Federer showcased his fashion sense as he bid farewell to 2025 and welcomed the new year 2026. He celebrated the New Year wearing a stylish fedora.\nFederer, who turned professional in 1998, won a total of 20 Grand Slam singles titles during his career, including six Australian Open titles, one French Open title, eight Wimbledon titles, and five US Open titles. He was ranked World No. 1 in the ATP rankings, won a gold and a silver Olympic medal, among many other accolades.\nRoger Federer Welcomes 2026 While Flaunting a Stylish Hat Federer recently took to social media to share a carousel of pictures from his New Year’s Eve celebration. He was spotted in an all-white ensemble paired with a black fedora featuring white detailing. The Swiss also accessorized with what appeared to be a Rolex Datejust 36, featuring a white dial.\n“2026 Mood 🎩 😎 🎆,” Federer captioned his Instagram post.\nFederer retired from professional tennis three years ago, in 2022, after competing at the Laver Cup.\nMORE: Roger Federer Joins Andre Agassi for Star-Filled ‘Battle of the World No. 1s’ to Launch 2026 Australian Open\nRoger Federer To Be a Part of Inaugural Australian Open Opening Ceremony The Australian Open will host its inaugural opening ceremony in 2026. The Grand Slam tournament is scheduled to take place from January 12, 2025, to February 1, 2026, at Melbourne Park.\nThe opening ceremony for the Melbourne Major will be held on January 17, 2026, with Federer headlining the event. It will feature a match dubbed the ‘Battle of the World No.1s,’ where the Swiss will be joined by Andre Agassi, Patrick Rafter, and Lleyton Hewitt.\nSpeaking ahead of the 2026 Australian Open, Federer said: “It feels like a lifetime ago that I coined the phrase the ‘Happy Slam’ for the Australian Open, and it still makes me smile when I think about all the moments I’ve had here.”\nThe former World No. 1 reminisced about winning the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup, playing in front of Australian tennis legend Rod Laver, and the Aussie fans.\n“I’ve experienced so many emotions on Rod Laver Arena … the joy of lifting ‘Norman’ six times, the honour of playing in front of Rod Laver himself, the challenge of competing against my biggest rivals, and always the overwhelming love and support of the Australian fans,” he continued.\nFederer also recalled winning the Australian Open back-to-back in 2017 and 2018. He also said that he was excited to create more “fantastic moments” with his Australian fans.\n“Coming back to win the AO in 2017 is one of my most treasured Grand Slam memories and backing it up to win in 2018 was another dream come true in Melbourne. I can’t wait to come down under again to the AO and create more fantastic moments with all the Aussie fans,” Federer added.\nThroughout his career, Federer won the Australian Open six times, with the last of them coming in 2018. He defeated Aljaž Bedene, Jan-Lennard Struff, Richard Gasquet, Márton Fucsovics, Tomáš Berdych, and Chung Hyeon to reach the final.\nIn the championship match, the former World No. 1 triumphed over Marin Čilić with a scoreline of 6-2, 6-7(5), 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 to win the tournament, defending his title and securing his 20th and final Grand Slam.",
