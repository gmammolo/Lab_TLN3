  "text": "The General Assembly of the Jordan Tourism Board recently convened to approve the 2026 action plan and budget , alongside endorsing the marketing plan for the same year. This strategic step was outlined during the Board’s annual meeting, held under the chairmanship of Emad Hejazeen , the Minister of Tourism and Antiquities . The session also saw the participation of Ramzi Maaytah , the Managing Director of the Jordan Tourism Board, as well as various members of the Board and private sector representatives from Jordan’s tourism industry.\nThe approval of the 2026 action plan and budget marks a significant milestone in the country’s ongoing efforts to enhance its tourism sector. The plan is designed to align with broader economic and sectoral goals, ensuring that tourism plays an even more critical role in Jordan’s economic recovery and growth. Key Objectives and Strategic Pillars of the 2026 Action Plan\nThe Jordan Tourism Board’s 2026 marketing plan outlines several key objectives and strategic pillars aimed at strengthening Jordan’s position as a top tourist destination. The plan not only focuses on increasing tourist numbers but also aims to maximize the economic impact of tourism through strategic marketing initiatives.\nOne of the core aspects of the plan is to enhance the efficiency of spending across various tourism initiatives. This approach will focus on maximizing the return on investment in tourism programs and ensuring that marketing efforts are targeted and effective. The Board’s emphasis on sustainable practices is reflected in its long-term goals of increasing tourism-related employment opportunities , contributing to GDP growth , and promoting tourism investment . Aligning with Jordan’s Economic Modernization Vision\nThe 2026 action plan is strongly aligned with Jordan’s Economic Modernization Vision , a national initiative designed to stimulate economic growth , job creation , and increased competitiveness . Within this vision, the tourism sector is seen as a central driver, with the aim of diversifying Jordan’s economy and ensuring its long-term sustainability.\nKey aspects of this alignment include reducing tourism seasonality , increasing the average length of stay , and boosting spending per tourist . The goal is to shift the traditional seasonal tourism model and make Jordan a year-round destination for international visitors. These measures are expected to help reduce the dependency on peak-season tourism, providing stability and consistent growth in the industry. Advertisement In today’s digital age, the Board’s 2026 marketing strategy places a strong emphasis on expanding digital marketing efforts . By increasing online visibility and utilizing digital platforms , the Board aims to reach new and diverse target markets . This approach is designed to ensure that Jordan’s tourism offerings are well represented to a global audience, with a focus on leveraging social media , search engines , and online campaigns .\nAdditionally, international tourism exhibitions are a key component of the marketing plan, enabling Jordan to showcase its attractions to the global tourism industry. Active participation in such exhibitions will enhance awareness of Jordan as a must-visit destination, positioning the country as a key player on the international tourism map. Promoting the National Football Team’s Participation in the World Cup\nIn a bid to capitalize on global events, the Jordan Tourism Board has set its sights on promoting the Jordan national football team’s participation in the World Cup. The Board recognizes the powerful connection between major international sporting events and tourism. By aligning with such events, the plan aims to boost international interest in Jordan, attracting sports enthusiasts and creating a connection between the country’s rich cultural heritage and the global football community .\nThis unique promotional effort will be coordinated with various local and international partners to ensure that tourism-related opportunities linked to the World Cup are maximized. Leveraging such global sporting moments provides a strategic avenue to draw more attention to the country and its tourism potential. Ensuring Success During Tourism Event Seasons\nOne of the important facets of the 2026 action plan is to ensure the success of tourism event seasons throughout Jordan. These events, such as cultural festivals, concerts, and special exhibitions, are designed to attract both domestic and international tourists and boost seasonal tourism. By enhancing the quality and diversity of these events, Jordan can establish itself as a year-round destination, drawing visitors beyond just the summer months.\nAdditionally, the Board’s efforts include supporting low-cost and charter flights , which play a significant role in increasing access to Jordan for international tourists. By making travel more affordable and accessible, the Board aims to increase the volume of tourists from diverse geographical regions. Addressing Structural Challenges for Long-Term Growth\nDespite the optimism surrounding Jordan’s tourism sector, the 2026 action plan acknowledges several structural challenges that must be addressed to ensure sustainable growth. One of the primary challenges noted is climate change , which is affecting both the demand for and supply of tourism services. Extreme weather events , such as heatwaves and severe storms , have underscored the importance of investing in resilient infrastructure and energy efficiency to safeguard the long-term viability of the sector.\nThe report also highlights the need for improved skills development and training within the tourism workforce to meet the growing demands of international tourists. Additionally, the high VAT rates and the inefficient Climate Change Fee are seen as obstacles to pricing competitiveness , particularly for smaller tourism businesses with limited access to financing. Addressing these issues is critical for maintaining Jordan’s attractiveness as a competitive global destination. A Comprehensive Strategy for Sustainable Tourism Growth\nIn conclusion, the 2026 action plan and marketing strategy devised by the Jordan Tourism Board represent a comprehensive effort to enhance the country’s tourism sector. By addressing key challenges such as seasonality , sustainability , and investment in infrastructure , the plan aims to create a more resilient and competitive tourism industry in Jordan. The inclusion of sports promotions , event seasons , and digital marketing efforts ensures that Jordan will continue to thrive as a premier global tourism destination .\nAs Ilias Kikilias , the Director General of INSETE, noted, the future of Jordan’s tourism sector will rely heavily on strategic planning , effective destination management , and a long-term focus on sustainability and resilience . Through these efforts, the country will not only attract more visitors but also generate long-term economic benefits for local communities.\nAdvertisement",
