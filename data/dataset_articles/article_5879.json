  "text": "King earns top firefighter award at annual banquet\nFirefighter Shaun King was awarded 2025 Firefighter of the Year at the Polson Rural Fire District firefighter appreciation banquet on Dec. 6.\nCaptain Grant Clapp was awarded the Fire Chief’s award for his commitment and overall contributions to the department and support of Chief Will Woodger. The Rookie of the Year was awarded to Andrew Johnson for outstanding performance of a firefighter in their first year of service.\nSixty people attended the banquet, held at the Mission Valley Elks Lodge, including the firefighters and their families. Also in attendance were Rural Fire District board members, including chair Fred Nelson and trustees Dick Wonderlich, Jack Clapp and Ron Roberts, along with their respective spouses, board secretary Kelley Druyvestein and Lake County Sheriff Don Bell.\nChief Woodger, who is in his second year in the position, expressed high praise and gratitude for the firefighters and the many hours of volunteer time they invest in the rural department. He also acknowledged the families of the firefighters, noting that without their support, volunteers would find it difficult to continue to respond.\nOver the past year, the department answered 292 calls. The chief pointed out that the community was better served by the fast response time with which calls were handled.\nHe also expressed the department’s gratitude to the many Polson businesses that donated items and gift certificates that were given to the firefighters in appreciation of all that they do for the community.",
