  "text": "BUNNELL, Fla. – The Flagler County Sheriff’s Office will honor the 911 caller whose actions saved an 11-year-old kidnapping victim from a registered sex offender in December.\nThe 911 caller, who has not been named yet, will be recognized during the sheriff’s office award ceremony in Bunnell.\nNews4JAX will stream the event at 2:30 p.m.\nAccording to News4JAX sister station WKMG in Orlando, in the audio released on Tuesday, the caller told a dispatcher he saw Darnell Hairston, 60, driving along U.S. Highway 1.\n“There’s a child pedophile with two kids in his truck,” the caller said. “He’s our neighborhood child pedophile, and there’s two missing kids that’s run away from out there.”\nAccording to the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office, Hairston had two boys, 15 and 11, inside his truck.\nDeputies said the 11-year-old was in a Snapchat group chat with the teen. The boy said in the chat that he thought Hairston sexually assaulted his friend, which deputies say led the teen to help lure the boy to Hairston.\nThe boy said Hairston choked him until he passed out, then tied him up with duct tape over his mouth.\nDeputies said they found evidence matching the boy’s story.\nWhile on the phone with a dispatcher, the 911 caller said he was determined to see Hairston caught.\n“I’m following until I see a cop pull his a** over, because he’s got two kids in his car,” the caller said. “If a cop don’t pull him over, I’m going to pull him over and it ain’t going to be f***ing pretty.”\nDeputies caught up to Hairston and while making the arrest, the 15-year-old got behind the wheel of the truck.\nDash-camera video showed the truck leading deputies on a chase until it rammed a patrol car and crashed.\nHairston is jailed, facing multiple charges for kidnapping and assault. The teen is held in the local juvenile detention center.",
