  "text": "By The Berkeley Observer ,\n1 days ago GOOSE CREEK, S.C. — The City of Goose Creek recorded notable declines in crime and faster police response times in 2025, according to year-end data released by the Goose Creek Police Department, highlighting what officials describe as continued progress amid the city’s growth.\n“This progress reflects the hard work and dedication of our officers and the strong partnership we share with our community,” GCPD posted to its official Facebook page. “Together, we remain committed to keeping Goose Creek a safe place to live, work, and raise a family.”\nSTAY IN THE LOOP\nSign Up for Berkeley County, SC Newsletter\nThe department reported zero homicides in 2025, marking a 100% decrease compared to the previous year. Violent and property crimes also trended downward across several categories. Armed robberies fell from 12 incidents in 2024 to five in 2025, a 58% reduction. Burglaries dropped by 42%, declining from 96 to 56 cases, while thefts from vehicles decreased 21%, from 168 to 133 incidents.\nVandalism incidents also edged down slightly, falling from 214 cases in 2024 to 207 in 2025.\nDrug-related violations declined as well, with reported cases dropping 12% year over year, from 503 to 443. Police officials attributed the reductions to targeted enforcement efforts and ongoing partnerships with community members.\nTraffic safety data showed improvement, with total collisions decreasing 14%, from 1,727 in 2024 to 1,490 in 2025.\nCREDIT: Goose Creek Police Department In addition to crime reductions, response times improved across both emergency and non-emergency calls. Average emergency response time decreased from 3.05 minutes to 3.01 minutes, while non-emergency response times saw a larger improvement, dropping from 6.05 minutes to 5.50 minutes.\nOne category showed an increase: arrests for receiving stolen goods rose by 44.5%, from 11 cases in 2024 to 16 in 2025. Police officials noted the increase reflects a rise in arrests of suspects found in possession of stolen property, rather than an increase in underlying crime.\nLocal news matters!
