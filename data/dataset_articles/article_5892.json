CART works on engaging with Nebraska businesses and consumers to facilitate a voluntary resolution of customer complaints, working in the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office on behalf of Nebraskans. In previous years, CART recovered over $1 million.\nComplaints and scam reports to the Attorney General’s Office can include imposter scams, home repairs, identity theft, auto issues, and online shopping. Consumers can connect with CART for one – on-one support by filing a complaint on ProtectTheGoodLife.Nebraska.gov or by calling the Attorney General’s Office at (402) 471-2785.
