  "text": "LONDON, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- Homicides recorded by police in England and Wales have dropped to their lowest level in more than four decades, new official figures show.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said 499 homicides were logged in the year to September 2025, down 7 percent compared with the previous 12 months. It is the smallest annual total since 1983, when 482 cases were recorded.\nThe ONS noted the decline was mainly linked to fewer deaths involving knives and other sharp objects. Such fatalities fell 23 percent to 174 over the same period.\nOther violence indicators also eased: recorded knife-related offenses slipped 9 percent to 50,430, while firearm-related crimes dipped 9 percent to 4,851.\nBritish Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced on Monday plans to create a new National Police Service, marking what the Home Office described as \"the largest reforms to policing since the police service was founded 200 years ago.\" She said the new body was designed to bring together talent, specialist skills and advanced technology under a single command structure.
