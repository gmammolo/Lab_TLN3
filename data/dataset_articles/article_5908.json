  "text": "Twenty-five Rwanda National Police (RNP) officers completed a two-week Counter Air Piracy Course on Thursday, January 29, at the Counter Terrorism Training Centre (CTTC) in Mayange, Bugesera District.\nThe training, conducted in partnership with the French National Gendarmerie, equips the officers with the skills to address air piracy threats, strengthen aviation security and counterterrorism preparedness.\nThe Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIGP) in charge of Operations, CP Vincent Sano, presided over the graduation ceremony and highlighted the strategic importance of aviation security in today’s evolving threat landscape.\n“The aviation domain remains one of the most strategic and sensitive sectors in modern security. Threats such as air piracy, unlawful interference, terrorism, and emerging technologies like drones continue to evolve, requiring preparedness, vigilance, and strong inter-agency cooperation,” CP Sano said.\nHe urged the graduates to apply their new skills with professionalism, integrity, and a strong sense of responsibility.\n“Security today requires more than authority; it requires competence, readiness, collaboration, and continuous learning.Your role is critical in ensuring that our air transport remains safe, resilient, and secure.”\nThe Counter Air Piracy Course represents a significant step in enhancing Rwanda’s aviation security and counterterrorism capabilities, while also strengthening international cooperation through capacity building and sustained partnerships.",
