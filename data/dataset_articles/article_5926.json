  "text": "To the editor:\nI extend my sincere thanks for the newspaper's recent, thoughtful coverage of the impacts of increased ICE activity in our community.\nThe article, “Local resident remains in ICE detention facility,” reports on Juan Zepeda, moving beyond headlines and statistics to remind readers that immigration enforcement affects real people, families, and neighborhoods. By focusing on a local resident’s experience, the newspaper gave our community an opportunity to better understand the emotional and practical consequences.\nI also appreciated the article, “Moral beacons – faith leaders give support during ICE surge,” highlighting the compassion and leadership shown by Risen Savior Catholic Church and Faith United Methodist Church. The reporting captured how faith communities are stepping forward to offer comfort, resources, and belonging to those who may feel afraid or isolated.\nFinally, coverage of Apple Valley Police Chief Nick Francis and his comments on ICE operations brought a law enforcement perspective into the public conversation. Social media often amplifies only the loudest or most polarizing voices; the story provided readers with context and insight that supports informed and respectful dialogue.\nIn stark contrast, particularly in light of recent events, I received a \"newsletter\" from my state representative that relied heavily on emotionally charged language and claims that remain disputed or difficult to verify. The newspaper's reporting stands out for its careful sourcing, balanced framing, and commitment to presenting multiple perspectives. That difference matters and better serves our community than the hyperbolic and unverified message I received from my representative.\nTogether, these stories reflect the best of local journalism: fair, grounded in facts, and rooted in the lives of the people served. Thank you for helping our community stay informed while encouraging empathy, understanding, and civil discussion during a challenging and emotional time.\nJohn Chatelaine\nLakeville",
