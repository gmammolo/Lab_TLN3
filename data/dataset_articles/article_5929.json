During its run, Trafficked made history in becoming the most Emmy-nominated unscripted series in a single year, with 29.\nVan Zeller’s investigations have spanned the opioid crisis, immigration, cybercrime, and the explosive rise of scamming as a global industry, consistently revealing the human motivations behind the world’s shadow economies. Most recently, she launched The Hidden Third , a weekly video podcast marking the next evolution of her work, which offers rare, long-form interviews with criminals, law enforcement officials, and advocates working to dismantle clandestine economies. Van Zeller has also spoken widely about her experience of being a woman and mother reporting in the world’s shadow economy, including at TEDx, the Estoril Conferences, Money 20/20, Women in Cable TV and D23.\n'Longlegs' Star Alicia Witt Signs With Mosaic\nVan Zeller’s production company Muck Media is behind Trafficked , the Emmy- and Sundance-winning documentary Science Fair , Netflix’s Mucho Mucho Amor , and HBO’s American Pain .
