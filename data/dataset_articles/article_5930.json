  "text": "The Police and Crime Commissioner for the West Midlands, Simon Foster, says he is pleased after new figures revealed further reductions in knife crime and overall crime across the region.\nLatest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), covering the year ending October 2024 to September 2025, shows total recorded crime across the West Midlands has fallen by more than six per cent, resulting in nearly 22,000 fewer victims in the last year.\nCrimes that matter to local communities have continued to fall, with knife crime down by 21 per cent, home burglaries down 22 per cent, robbery down by more than 22 per cent, vehicle crime down 16 per cent and gun crime down 14 per cent. Serious youth violence has also reduced by almost 11 per cent, while theft from the person offences are down by 14 per cent.\nKnife crime remains a top priority for the PCC and West Midlands Police. After historically having some of the highest rates of knife crime per 1,000 population, the West Midlands has now seen sustained reductions for more than 12 months, driven by targeted enforcement, prevention work and close partnership working with local authorities, health services, schools and community organisations.\nPolice and Crime Commissioner Simon Foster said: “These reductions in crime are welcome. They show that the West Midlands is becoming a safer place to live.\n“Fewer victims, falling knife and gun crime, and reductions in the offences that matter to our communities, reflect the hard work of officers, staff and partners.\n“This progress shows what can be achieved through focused policing, strong partnerships, and a relentless commitment to tackling crime.”\n“However, I am not remotely complacent. There is more to do.\n“I will continue to hold the force to account, to drive constant and unremitting to action to ensure continuous improvement, to keep the people of the West Midlands safe and secure.”\nCall handling performance has also improved significantly. In 2025, West Midlands Police answered more than 720,000 emergency 999 calls, with an average answer time of just two seconds, compared to 57 seconds in summer 2022. More than 830,000 non-emergency 101 calls were answered in an average of 25 seconds.\nThe national statistics also highlight improvements in policing performance, with faster response times, increased arrests and better outcomes for victims contributing to the continued fall in crime.\nOver the last 12 months, West Midlands Police has arrested more than 60,000 people, with positive outcomes — including charges and cautions — rising to nearly 15 per cent.\nActing Chief Constable Scott Green said: “The results speak for themselves, with continued crime reductions in the West Midlands thanks to the hard work of our officers and staff. We are doing what the public rightly expect — arresting offenders, solving crimes and helping people feel safer.”\nMr Green added: “Despite these reductions, we know there is more to do. Any crime is one too many, and we remain committed to protecting people from harm and focusing on the crimes that have the greatest impact on communities.”\nBack to News Archive",
