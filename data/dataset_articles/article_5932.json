Credit : Mossos d'Esquadra/X\nNEED TO KNOW An off-duty police officer is being praised after a man fell onto Barcelona subway tracks in viral footage The officer had noticed the man stumbling and alerted officials before he tumbled onto the tracks Bystanders helped pull the man back to safety as the dramatic moment spread online A terrifying moment on the Barcelona Metro is going viral months later after an off-duty police officer rushed to save a man who fell onto the subway tracks.\nThe incident happened in November 2025, but CCTV footage shared online in December has recently gained widespread attention again, spreading beyond Spanish-language social media and drawing praise from viewers around the world.\nAccording to Dexerto , off-duty Catalonia police officer Felisa Pozas was waiting for a train on Nov. 25 when she noticed a man nearby stumbling along the platform. Surveillance video shows Pozas watching him closely, appearing visibly concerned as he moved unsteadily.\nSensing something was wrong, Pozas quickly pressed the station’s SOS intercom to alert officials. Moments later, the situation escalated in the most frightening way.\nSeconds after she signaled for help, the man lost his balance and fell over the edge of the platform onto the tracks below. The footage shows him lying motionless as Pozas and three other bystanders immediately sprang into action.\nThe group rushed down to the tracks and worked together to drag the man back up to safety before an oncoming train could arrive. Additional people then gathered around to assess the man’s condition as the clip ended.\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\nThe dramatic rescue has since gone viral in early 2026, with many online praising Pozas’ quick thinking and the bystanders who didn’t hesitate to help.\nClose Leave a Comment Read more: Human Interest",
