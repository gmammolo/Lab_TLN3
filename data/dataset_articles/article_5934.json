  "text": "McGuireWoods once again ranked among the leading law firms for advising clients in M&A transactions in 2025, according to year-end league tables published by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG).\nThe firm earned high rankings for overall U.S. M&A deals closed or announced in 2025, as well as mid-market (up to $500 million) and small-cap (up to $50 million) transactions.\nMcGuireWoods assisted clients in notable transactions across economic sectors, reflecting the depth and industry experience in the firm’s transactional practices.\nThe firm advised NiSource Inc.’s subsidiary Northern Indiana Public Service Company LLC (NIPSCO) and its new subsidiary NIPSCO Generation LLC in structuring a groundbreaking electric service agreement with Amazon to supply up to 3 gigawatts of capacity for Amazon data center sites in NIPSCO’s Northern Indiana service territory. In addition, the firm assisted with securing equity financing arrangements and led negotiations for all construction and power purchase agreements for the generation facilities that will provide the required capacity.\nMcGuireWoods represented private equity firm Hull Street Energy in its agreement to purchase Consumers Energy’s hydropower fleet, a major acquisition comprising 13 dams across Michigan with a combined installed capacity of 132 MW.\nThe firm advised Falfurrias Capital Partners, one of North Carolina’s largest private equity buyout firms, and its portfolio company, Sauer Brands, in Sauer Brands’ acquisition by Advent International.\nMcGuireWoods also is serving as legal counsel to cabinet manufacturer American Woodmark in an announced all-stock merger transaction with MasterBrand that is expected to create a combined company valued as of the date of announcement at $3.6 billion.\n“In a market defined by complexity, our clients rely on us for clarity and precision,” said Richard W. Viola, deputy managing partner of McGuireWoods’ corporate practice. “These rankings reflect our team’s ability to navigate the most intricate M&A landscapes to help our clients achieve their goals.”\nMcGuireWoods’ M&A and private equity capabilities have earned nationwide recognition from Chambers USA and The Legal 500.",
