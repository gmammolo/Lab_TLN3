  "text": "HOUSTON – Harris County Precinct 2 is putting new money behind an ongoing effort to clean up dangerous and neglected properties that officials say threaten public health and safety.\nCommissioners Court on Tuesday unanimously approved an agreement between Precinct 2 and Harris County Public Health that dedicates $500,000 toward nuisance property abatement within the precinct.\nRecommended Videos\nHouston officials question security after fire at abandoned church The funding continues a program that was previously supported countywide through federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars, which have largely been exhausted. Precinct 2 Commissioner Adrian Garcia approved the allocation from his precinct’s budget to ensure the work continues locally.\nNuisance properties, often abandoned or poorly maintained, can attract criminal activity, pose fire risks, and create health hazards for nearby residents. Garcia said addressing those risks is a key part of public safety.\n“My top priority as commissioner is public safety,” Garcia said. “That means more than just supporting law enforcement. It means investing in infrastructure, flood control, and even addressing or removing dangerous properties that put our communities at risk. I will not stand by while dangerous properties allow criminal activity to flourish.”\n2nd fire in 30 days at abandoned Spring Branch apartment complex sparks safety concerns Since 2019, Precinct 2 and Harris County Public Health have addressed more than 450 nuisance violations. Some of those cases involved properties near schools that raised safety concerns for students and families. Others, including a long-troubled property in the Cloverleaf area, generated repeated complaints due to excessive trash, unsanitary conditions, and unsafe structures.\nUnder the agreement, Harris County Public Health will continue working through the legal system to require property owners to bring sites into compliance or, when necessary, move forward with abatement. That can include removing excessive rubbish, correcting unsanitary conditions, or addressing structures that cannot be made safe.\n“Our mission is to protect the health and well-being of our community members in a safe place to call home,” said Scott Jeansonne, director of Harris County Public Health’s Environmental Public Health Division. “Nuisance properties are more than just eyesores; they’re safety hazards.”\nJeansonne said the conditions often found at these properties, including rodents, mosquitoes, and fire risks, can pose serious health concerns for surrounding neighborhoods. The added funding, he said, will allow the county to act more quickly.\nResidents who want to report a nuisance property can do so by calling 3-1-1. County officials say those reports play a critical role in identifying hazardous properties and starting the legal process needed to address them.\nCopyright 2026 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.",
