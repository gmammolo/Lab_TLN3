  "text": "YUBA CITY, Calif. — As Super Bowl LIX weekend approaches on February 8 and 9, the Yuba City Police Department is urging residents to prioritize safety by planning for sober driving.\n“Super Bowl celebrations are a time for fun and community, but safety should always come first,” Sgt. David Krause said. “If you plan to drink, make sure you have a reliable way to get home, whether that’s a designated sober driver, rideshare, taxi, or public transportation.”\nYCPD stated that additional officers will patrol during the weekend to identify drivers suspected of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\nCommunity members are encouraged to designate a sober driver, use rideshare services, or take public transportation. Super Bowl party hosts are also highly encouraged to have non-alcoholic options and ensure guests have safe rides home.\nDriving impaired isn't limited to alcohol; prescription and over-the-counter drugs, as well as marijuana, can also impair driving. The community is advised to call 9-1-1 if they suspect someone is driving while impaired.\nThis safety initiative is funded by a grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",
