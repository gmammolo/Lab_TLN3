  "text": "A year-long investigation led by London police has resulted in more than 200 charges laid against 11 people, the seizure of 31 guns and 12.5 kilograms of fentanyl — enough to kill one quarter of London's population, police say.\nAs part of its investigation into increasing gun violence last fall, the London Police Service (LPS) launched Project ALIAS in January 2025, in partnership with the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP).\n\"What began as a local concern quickly revealed criminal activity that crossed jurisdictions and extended beyond our borders,\" said LPS Chief Thai Truong.\nOn Thursday, police announced 14 search warrants were executed at homes and vehicles in both London and Toronto earlier this month.\nAll of the guns seized had been illegally smuggled into Canada from the United States, according to Thomas Carrique, Commissioner of the OPP. The fentanyl, equal to 125,000 lethal doses, was produced domestically, he said.\nOf the 11 people facing charges, seven reside in London, with others living in Toronto, North York and Stoney Creek. Nine have been arrested, with arrest warrants issued for the other two. Four have been released on bail, including three in London.\nFrom left to right: Ontario Provincial Police Commissioner Thomas Carrique, London Police Chief Thai Truong, and OPP Det-Insp.Jeff Brazeau hold a media conference to announce the results of Project ALIAS. (Jack Sutton/CBC) The smuggling of illegal firearms from south of the border continues to pose a threat, Carrique said, adding that 90 per cent of guns seized across Ontario are sourced back to the U.S — a figure that has not changed in years, he said.\n\"I don't see that figure changing unless we can do something collaboratively with our law enforcement partners in the U.S. and continue to see greater legislation, more penalties that reflect the seriousness of people who possess and use illegal firearms to perpetrate violent crimes in our communities,\" he added.\nThe following items were seized in the investigation:\n31 crime guns (guns used in a criminal offence, or intended for use in criminal activity) 25 prohibited devices, including over-capacity magazines and auto switches Imitation firearm 12.5 kilograms of fentanyl 4.5 kilograms of cocaine 275 oxycodone pills 460 hydromorphone pills 75 alprazolam pills CAD $64,000 Two vehicles as offence-related property High-end jewelry Cell phones and electronic devices Focus on illegal guns more effective than buy-back program, police say The federal government has banned more than 2,500 makes and models of assault-style weapons since 2020. Ottawa is attempting to get people and businesses to surrender these weapons through an effort called the Assault-Style Firearms Compensation Program, before the ban comes into effect on Oct. 30.\nLPS has chosen not to participate in the buy-back program, citing concerns over its effectiveness and a need for resources to instead be directed at trafficking and possession of illegal firearms.\n\"I think today is an example of what you see our focus is right now here in London,\" Truong said. \"These firearms all trace back from the United States, illegally smuggled in. These are crime guns.\"\n\"Our efforts and our resources are focused on gun violence, drug trafficking, all those biggest indicators of crime and impact to the city. That's our focus.\"",
