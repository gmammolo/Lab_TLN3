  "text": "Cincinnati invests $2M in police security cameras for West End, high-crime areas\nFederal and city funding will repair, install 99 cameras across Cincinnati in 30-day plan\nCINCINNATI (WXIX) - More than $2 million in federal and city funding is being invested in Cincinnati police security cameras for the West End and other high-crime areas across the city.\nThe investment combines $1 million in federal money secured by Congressman Greg Landsman with $1.2 million in city funds.\nCincinnati Police Department is approximately two weeks into a 30-day plan to repair or install 99 cameras, according to a memo from City Manager Sheryl Long.\nNew cameras target West End after tragedies\nOf the 99 cameras, six are new installations in the West End.\nAn additional six cameras were installed by CPD in the West End in the fall of 2025, totaling 12 new cameras in the West End when the 30-day plan is complete.\nThe funding comes after community members repeatedly called for cameras and safety measures following two separate tragedies.\nIn November 2023, 11-year-old Dominic Davis was shot and killed near Laurel Park in the West End.\nTwo years later, 11-year-old QueenEr’Re Reed was killed in a drive-by shooting while playing at the same park.\n“The West End I think was a wake up call for a lot of people in the sense that you have an 11-year-old girl who was shot, killed, on a playground and you know, it’s not the first time it’s happened but at some point you have to say like, you know, we have to have these spaces where kids can go and they will be safe,” Landsman said.\nCity responds to crime spike\nCincinnati City Councilman Jeff Cramerding said more security cameras around the city are desperately needed.\n“Over the summer, we had a spike in crime. It’s very serious. At that time council allocated an additional $5.4 million for public safety,” Cramerding said.,“Public safety is our number one concern. We had an ongoing conversation. We always want to make sure we’ve got enough resources committed to that,” he said.\nCamera system needs repairs\nLandsman said he became aware of the camera system’s problems after visiting the Communications Center.\n“When I first learned about it, I went to the Communications Center and you could see there, there were a ton of cameras that were red, or they weren’t working. And so I said like, is this a big problem? They said, yes, 10% of our cameras aren’t working,” Landsman said.\nWith bipartisan support, Landsman secured $1 million for the Cincinnati Police Department Camera Technology Project.\nMost security cameras in neighborhoods are on wheels so they can be moved around.\nFOP President Ken Kober said the city will eventually put up permanent cameras in many areas.\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?
