  "text": "Mayor Gorton touts crime drop, record employment in state of city-county address\nLEXINGTON, Ky. (WKYT) - Mayor Linda Gorton delivered her annual State of the City-County Address Thursday morning, highlighting a 10.8 percent drop in violent crimes. She also revealed in 2025, Lexington saw record employment levels.\nGorton said crime statistics showed significant improvements, including a 13 percent decrease in homicides and a 26 percent decrease in robberies. She credited new investments in public safety and community programs for shaping the city’s progress.\n“Our economy remains very strong. Over the past year, we set a record for the highest employment in our history. Currently there are 171,656 people employed in Fayette County,” Gorton said.\nThe mayor said 2025 brought new partnerships with surrounding counties to provide parks to residents. She said continued growth attracts new employers through industrial and regional business parks, with projects expected to bring new jobs and long-term economic growth to Central Kentucky.\nGorton highlighted workforce development programs that helped residents gain job skills and connect directly with employers. Programs like One Lexington, designed to combat crime among Lexington youth, served thousands of people over the past year.\n“Last year, Lexington recorded the fewest total homicides of young people in a decade,” she said.\nTechnology improvements for first responders\nThe mayor said 2025 brought new technology that improved how first responders provide assistance to the community.\n“Lexington ambulances now have access to whole blood to perform transfusions at the scene. Our firefighters have already administered blood over 20 times,” Gorton said.\nShe said only a small percentage of EMS agencies nationwide can perform this service.\nThe city also explored renewable energy options. “We continue to explore solar energy and its potential for Lexington,” Gorton said.\nHousing challenges persist\nDespite economic gains, Gorton acknowledged housing remains a challenge. With only 231 affordable housing units under construction, the city saw changes in its unhoused population.\n“Like many other cities, across our nation, we saw an increase in the number of unhoused people in Lexington last year,” she said.\nIn 2025, the city formed the Mayor’s Task Force on Homelessness to combat rising numbers. Gorton said the city continues to expand this resource and hopes the task force will implement changes for 2026.\nCopyright 2026 WKYT. All rights reserved.",
