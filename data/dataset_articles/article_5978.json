  "text": "Kean Delivers $1.2 Million to Byram Township for Critical Police Department Headquarters\n(January 29, 2026) BYRAM TOWNSHIP, NJ – Today, Congressman Tom Kean, Jr. (NJ-07) presented $1,237,500 to Byram Township for a critically needed police headquarters renovation, funding he secured through the FY2026 Community Project Funding process to directly support local law enforcement.\nFor decades, Byram Township’s police officers have served their community out of mobile construction trailers dating back to the 1970s. This federal investment will transform an existing 4,500 square foot office building into a modern, fully equipped police headquarters.\n“I am honored to deliver this $1.2 million grant that will finally give Byram’s police the proper headquarters they deserve,” said Congressman Tom Kean, Jr. “I have consistently made supporting our law enforcement a top priority. This funding will equip them with the facilities they need to effectively protect and serve every family in the Byram area.”\n“On behalf of Byram Township, we are very grateful for Congressman Kean's support and engagement throughout this process,” said Byram Mayor Alex Rubenstein. “This grant will help advance public safety priorities for our community, and we appreciate the partnership with his office in helping secure this funding.”\n“This federal grant is not only an investment in public safety, but also a fiscally responsible decision for the taxpayers of Byram,” said Chief Thomas Dellicker, Byram Township Police Department. “By leveraging federal resources, we can provide our officers with the modern, safe, and functional facilities they deserve and help minimize additional financial strain on our residents. We are grateful to Congressman Kean for championing this effort, and to Mayor Rubenstein for proactively requesting this critical funding on behalf of our community.”\n\"Our local law enforcement throughout Sussex County are on the front lines protecting our communities each and every day,” said Sussex County Sheriff Mike Strada. “Ensuring that Byram Township's finest have an upgraded home base will support their mission to protect and serve the public. I thank Congressman Kean for this critical funding for the Byram Township Police Department, which further demonstrates his strong backing of our law enforcement here in Northwest New Jersey.”\n“For far too long, the Byram Police Department has needed and deserved a proper headquarters building. I'm thankful that Congressman Kean's advocacy is finally going to make this happen,” said New Jersey Assemblyman Michael Inganamort. “This is the difference a responsive Congressman makes, and I'm happiest for the people of Byram who will see a real public safety benefit.”\n“I am very grateful to Congressman Kean for all the hard work he did to get us this funding,” said Byram Councilwoman Cris Franco. “I have been working on this project since 2018 when I was on the building subcommittee, so we have been pushing hard for this for a long time. We are so happy.”\nSince taking office, Congressman Tom Kean, Jr. has secured over $12 million for police departments across New Jersey’s Seventh Congressional District through the Community Project Funding process, demonstrating a consistent, tangible commitment to backing the blue with real resources. Kean remains steadfast in ensuring local law enforcement officers receive the support and equipment necessary to keep our communities safe.\nAll 15 projects that Congressman Kean was allotted for the FY2026 Community Project Funding process have now passed the U.S. House of Representatives.
