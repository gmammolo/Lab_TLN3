  "text": "Senators Hirono and Collins introduce bipartisan legislation aimed at improving hate crime reporting and response in the U.S.\nQuiver AI Summary\nSenators Hirono and Collins introduce bipartisan legislation: U.S. Senators Mazie Hirono and Susan Collins have unveiled the Improving Reporting to Prevent Hate Act (IRPHA) to enhance hate crime reporting accuracy.
