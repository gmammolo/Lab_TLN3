  "text": "Being a good Texan on the road isn’t just about driving kind, courteous, and safe. It’s about looking out for each other, and that includes watching for the signs of human trafficking. While some behaviors on our roadways are obviously unsafe, the signs of human trafficking may not be as obvious.\nThat’s why TxDOT is raising awareness about the tragic reality of human trafficking and empowering employees and travelers across the state to recognize the signs of human trafficking to help stop this horrific crime. Together we can ensure a Texas where nobody is victimized by human trafficking, and everyone feels safe to travel our roads freely.\n“What would happen if we all know the signs of human trafficking and act when we see it? We can work together to give anyone who travels in Texas peace of mind wherever they go,” TxDOT Executive Director Marc Williams said. “We know our transportation system can be a conduit for trafficking, which is why we are providing tips to our employees and Texas drivers on how to spot the signs.”\nDuring National Human Trafficking Prevention Month, TxDOT is sharing important safety messages across the state, including new posters at Travel Information Centers. These can reach Texas drivers along major interstate corridors and encourage people to be on the lookout.\nTxDOT employees also receive training to spot the signs of human trafficking. This training has helped save victims by enabling our TxDOT employees to recognize the signs of human trafficking at travel centers and report them to law enforcement.\nOur Human Trafficking Awareness training educates our employees about the various types of human trafficking, red flags commonly associated with human trafficking, how transportation is used to aid traffickers, and ways individuals can safely report suspicious activity.\nTxDOT employees recently wore blue in recognition of “Wear Blue Day,” to raise awareness about human trafficking.\nHere are some “red flags” that might indicate labor trafficking or sex trafficking:\nIt’s important for all of us to be aware, stay vigilant, and report signs of human trafficking. If you see any of these red flags, you can report the situation through several ways:\nBy being alert and “trusting your gut” when something feels wrong, you can help play a role in preventing the tragedy of human trafficking and making sure Texas roadways are safe for all of us.\nNo comments on this item\nPlease log in to comment by clicking here",
