  "text": "Jordan Chiles Gets Major Legal Win in Fight Over Paris Olympics Bronze Medal\nThere’s a huge update regarding the ongoing saga of Jordan Chiles and her Olympic bronze medal.\nIf you don’t remember, the 24-year-old gymnast was stripped of the medal amid a timing controversy at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\nKeep reading to find out more…\nYears later, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court determined there were “flaws in the initial process,” and has granted part of her appeal, per USA Gymnastics.\n“We are pleased the Swiss Federal Supreme Court recognized the flaws in the initial process and that Jordan’s case can now be heard inclusive of all relevant evidence. USA Gymnastics will continue to support the efforts of Jordan and her team to retain her bronze medal in the 2024 Olympic women’s floor exercise. We look forward to a fair arbitration that includes the clear evidence proving the inquiry into Jordan’s score was filed well within 1 minute as required by FIG rules,” they said.\n“In the highly exceptional circumstances of the case in question, it considers that there is a likelihood for the audio-visual recording of the final on 5 August 2024 to lead to a modification of the contested award in favour of the applicants, since the CAS [Court of Arbitration for Sport] could consider, in the light of this audio-visual sequence, that the verbal inquiry made on behalf of Jordan Chiles had been made before the expiry of the regulatory one-minute time limit,” the Swiss Federal Tribunal said in a press release.",
