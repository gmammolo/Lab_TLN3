  "text": "Marquette woman freed after nearly 17 months in county jail\nA Hamilton County jury of 10 women and four men has found Tiffany Cure of Marquette not guilty of all charges related to the death of infant Stormi Swartz in August of 2024.\nThe jury deliberated for about 2-1/2 hours on Wednesday afternoon before returning with not guilty verdicts on charges of first degree murder and child abuse leading to death.\nThe trial began with jury selection on Tuesday, Jan. 20 and the state began presenting witnesses the next day. Prosecutors rested their case against Cure on Tuesday this week and defense attorneys Timothy Noerrlinger and Dana DeSimone began presenting their witnesses. The defense rested its case Wednesday afternoon and the case was submitted to the jury at 3:51 p.m. The four alternate jurors were removed to another room, leaving the jury of 12 to deliberate Cure's fate.\nAt 5:28 p.m. a question was sent from a juror to Judge Rachael Daugherty who answered by directing the jurors to instruction No. 4 of the jury instructions, which stated that in arguing their case, attorneys for the state and defense “may draw legitimate deductions and inferences from the evidence.”\nThe jury returned its verdict of not guilty on both charges at 6:31 p.m. At that point the jury was dismissed and Cure was discharged from custody.\nThe 22-year-old Cure has been lodged at the Hamilton County Jail since her arrest in late August of 2024, except for a short furlough in order to give birth to a baby in March of last year.\nFollowing the jury's decision, Hamilton County Attorney Douglas Dexter released the following statement: “Our hearts go out to Stormi and her family, but we respect the verdict of the jury.\"",
