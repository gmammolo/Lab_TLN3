  "text": "\"I never said anything wrong or made any such comment,\" she said (File) An MP-MLA court in Rampur on Thursday acquitted former MP and actor Jaya Prada in an election code violation case registered in 2019. The actor was the BJP candidate from Rampur in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and was defeated by Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan. The MP-MLA court Judge, Shobhit Bansal, acquitted Jaya Prada in the case lodged against her at Kemri police station in Rampur under IPC section 171 G (false statement in connection with an election), senior prosecution officer Amarnath Tiwari said. The 62-year-old former MP, who won the Lok Sabha election from Rampur in 2004 and 2009 on a Samajwadi Party ticket, was present in the court while the judgement was pronounced. Talking to reporters after her acquittal in the case, Jaya said, \"I want to thank the honourable court for acquitting me in the case. I have been a two-time MP from Rampur... I never said anything wrong or made any such comment.\" \"I want to tell the public that I have represented Rampur and will always stay in Rampur. 'Satyamev Jayate' (Truth alone triumphs),\" she said. Senior prosecution officer Tiwari told reporters that the case against Jaya Prada was registered after she allegedly made remarks on Azam Khan. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com When asked about the comments on which the FIR was registered, Tiwari said that in her speech at an election rally she had said, \"Going through the comments Azam Khan makes against me (Jaya Prada), Mayawati (BSP chief) you must think his X-ray like eyes will also stare at you.\" (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",
