  "text": "Ukraine Urges NATO to Lift Long-Range Weapon Restrictions, Calls it a 'Game-Changer' Ukraine has called on NATO to lift restrictions on its use of long-range weapons, highlighting the need for more robust support against Russia. During a NATO summit, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg emphasized unity and ongoing support for Ukraine. NATO's declaration criticized China’s alignment with Russia, inciting a strong rebuke from Beijing. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 12-07-2024 03:39 IST | Created: 12-07-2024 03:39 IST Ukraine on Thursday urged NATO allies to lift restrictions on its use of long-range weapons against targets in Russia, describing such a move as a \"game-changer\" in its ongoing war with Moscow. Meanwhile, China slammed NATO's criticism of its support for Russia, calling it biased and malicious. Speaking at a three-day NATO summit in Washington, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg emphasized the alliance's continued support for Ukraine, asserting, \"At this summit we are turning a corner and putting in place the foundations for Ukraine to prevail.\" The summit ended with a strong declaration of unity, intending to reassure Ukraine of NATO's long-term backing. In a lighter moment, U.S. President Joe Biden mistakenly referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as \"President Putin\" before quickly correcting himself. This summit also brought attention to divergences among NATO members on the use of donated weapons by Ukraine. While some members endorse strikes inside Russia, the U.S. has taken a more conservative stance. (Disclaimer: With inputs from agencies.)",
