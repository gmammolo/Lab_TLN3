Dave Joyce. Last week, Hildenbrand and members of the department met with state Sen. Sandra O’Brien to also thank her for her support in the application to the One Time Strategic Community Investments fund.\nWith this, the department was able to secure an additional $2 million for construction of the new fire station.\nCovering the cost of construction of the new fire station will not be put on the ballot nor will it cost taxpayers of the township any added money.\n“This not only provides a much needed new facility, but we will dedicate an area that will allow residents from Hambden to vote here and not have to go elsewhere because the old facility was not large enough,” Hildenbrand said. “It also will help with recruitment of new firefighters. It is multi-purpose and a win for us all.”\nHe said the idea of a new fire station started when the department was looking at an addition on the current building, but he said “quite frankly it was built for a volunteer department and doesn’t have living and sleeping requirements for three people to be there 24 hours a day.”\nWith a small training room and cramped quarters, they needed an expansion to make the station more usable.\nThey went to the federal government and talked with Joyce, but instead of another addition it was suggested they wanted a new building that would last for 40 to 50 years.\nThe federal government awarded $6.75 million but the department had to come up with $2 million in matching funds. Thanks to O’Brien and Ohio Senator Matt Dolan, the match got granted.\nAt least three additions including putting a peak roof on to replace the original flat roof, have happened to the original facility, but it still wasn’t big enough.\nCurrently, the department is looking at two different plots of land in the township for the new station. Hildenbrand said they have an architect in mind for the design, which he said “doesn’t have to be the Taj Mahal, just something basic.”\nThe fact that it will help all around and help with morale and it doesn’t have to go to a bond issue is a reason for excitement in Hambden Township for local officials and all members of the community.\n“I am also a taxpayer, and you don’t see something like this every day,” Hildenbrand said.\nShare this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Share via SMS (Opens in new window)",
