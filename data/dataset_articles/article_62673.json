  "text": "SEATTLE — In a long awaited breakthrough, the U.S. and Canada have reached an agreement in principal renewing the Columbia River Treaty, which governs the use of the most important river flowing through the two nations. The agreement, yet to be ratified by the U.S. Senate, was announced by the White House and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Thursday morning. It modernizes the agreement that has managed the Columbia Basin and its hydropower dams for more than 50 years. Binding for 20 years, the deal strives to balance energy coordination with a new power intertie north of Spokane that will allow Canada more opportunities to import and export hydropower into the U.S. market, a crucial boost to both countries striving to reach clean energy goals, President Joe Biden said in a statement. The U.S. will benefit from water storage at Canadian dams, which control flooding and protect vulnerable communities while also providing reliable flows critical for irrigation, fish and other needs.",
