Nigeria is a democratic country, and we know very well that President Tinubu and the Renewed Hope agenda are democratic.\n“And I believe that the judgement is taken in very good faith. All Nigerians should be happy about it.\n“I don’t think anybody is against development in the local governments. I don’t think so.\n“I have not read the details of the judgement as passed; when we do, I believe that the application of it should add some pep to our local government administration.”\nALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE\nReps query Women Minister spending practices FULL LIST: 12 more state-owned tertiary institutions submit data to NELFUND BREAKING: Tinubu swears in eight new permanent secretaries UPDATED: Oyo APC lawmaker, Akinremi, is dead Reps to scrutinize controversial clauses in Samoa partnership agreement FULL LIST: NGX suspends eight companies from trading in shares",
