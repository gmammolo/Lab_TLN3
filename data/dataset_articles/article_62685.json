  "text": "Some respondents in Bauchi have described the Thursday Supreme Court judgement on LGAs’ financial autonomy as the best thing to have happened to democratic governance.\nA cross-section of those who spoke to Tribune Online expressed confidence that LGAs, as the third tier of government as enshrined in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), will now find their positions to govern.\nAbdullahi Yalwa, National Publicity Secretary of ASUP, while reacting, said, “As a proud Nigerian, let me begin by thanking the Lord Almighty for this blessing from the Supreme Court. I equally salute the apex court for its commitment towards national interest, progress, and development, as this is the summary content of the judgement to me.”\nHe added, “The beginning of a new prosperous Nigeria is indeed contained in the outcome of today’s judgement. The FGN has done well in its approach to the emancipation of Nigerians through the court from the self-centred politicians at the state level.”\nAccording to him, “Nigerians and indeed the FGN must be courageous to ensure the honest implementation of the judgement, as the governors, who are the major part of the country’s problem, will do all it takes to manipulate the successful execution of the judgement.”\nHe added, “The remaining issue left is for the country to review the electoral act and ensure that INEC, instead of the so-called SIEC, conducts the elections for the 774 LGAs in Nigeria and that the tenure of such elected chairmen starts and ends with the President, Governors, and other elected officers.”\nAbdullahi Yalwa further said, “People of substance should present themselves for service to humanity across all parties at this level of government as the most vital tier of administration in my understanding. When that is achieved, Nigeria will see rapid positive transformation in the form of improved security and safety, critical infrastructure development, and enhanced quality of life for the vast majority of Nigerians, who are believed to be rural dwellers at the LGA level.”\nHe stressed, “I am happy with the judgement, and it has renewed my hope in the Nigerian judiciary.”\nAlso reacting to the Supreme Court’s decision on L.G. autonomy, Bauchi-based legal practitioner Barrister Jibrin O. Jibrin said, “It is a very welcome development. As a citizen of Nigeria, an attorney and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, and a proponent of responsible democratic governance in the country, I welcome the judgement this morning by the Supreme Court upholding and granting financial autonomy to the local governments.”\nHe stressed, “The judgement represents a watershed in the struggle to entrench and deepen democratic governance at the local government level.”\n“To my mind, the Supreme Court has lived up to the task of interpreting as well as determining the correct position of the law on the issue,” he added.\nThe former Bauchi NBA Chairman stressed, “We are now looking forward to immediate compliance and enforcement of the verdict by all concerned and are hopeful that with full financial autonomy granted to them through this judgement, local governments will rise to their responsibility by ensuring that there is efficient, effective, and result-oriented administration at the third tier of government in such a manner that the people will in no time feel the positive impact of this landmark development.”\nHe concluded by saying, “I shall once more commend the Supreme Court for this wise and justice-serving decision while calling on fellow Nigerians to brace up for the task ahead. It is indeed a great one, and may we keep getting it right as a country.”\nIn his own reaction, a one-time Executive Chairman of Tafawa Balewa LGA and former member of the State House of Assembly, Muhammad Aminu Tukur, said, “Glory be to God. The Supreme Court of Nigeria has salvaged the souls of the common citizens of this great nation.”\nAccording to him, “granting local governments autonomy is a great feat, as the councils have finally gotten their most needed and essential freedom from the hands of fascist governors presiding over the affairs of their respective states along with the LGAs under their respective territories.”\nAminu Tukur stressed, “Prior to this laudable and commendable judgement, virtually all the LGAs across the length and breadth of Nigeria were reduced to mere salary pay points, denied the right to carry out their responsibilities as the third tier of government, nor given the chance even to provide the simplest social services such as constructing a mere culvert or pit latrine.”\nHe added, “The judgement in itself is commendable, as the primary reason for the creation of the local governments was to bring government closer to the people. With this development, the common citizens will surely access the dividends of leadership at close range.”\n“Finally, let me use this medium to commend the government of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for championing this cause to a final conclusion. I presided over an LGA with absolute autonomy under the military regime of General Abacha; this I envy and cherish to be retained,” the politician concluded.\nALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE\nReps query Women Minister spending practices FULL LIST: 12 more state-owned tertiary institutions submit data to NELFUND BREAKING: Tinubu swears in eight new permanent secretaries UPDATED: Oyo APC lawmaker, Akinremi, is dead Reps to scrutinize controversial clauses in Samoa partnership agreement FULL LIST: NGX suspends eight companies from trading in shares",
