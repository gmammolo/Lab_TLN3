  "title": "Harris in Greensboro: Biden \"a fighter\" who gets back up",
  "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris spoke for about 20 minutes at Dudley High School today as the Biden campaign looks to gain support in North Carolina following a disastrous debate performance by the president. Harris acknowledged the campaign's current challenges, saying recent days have shown that running for president of the United States is never easy. \"One thing we know about our president Joe Biden is that he is a fighter,\" Harris said. \"He is a fighter. And he is the first to say when you get knocked down, you get back up.\" She said that Biden's Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, has embraced Vladimir Putin and put the country in a position of weakness. \"That is disqualifying,\" she said to an especially large roar of agreement from the crowd. About 700 people attended the event at Dudley. Greensboro Mayor Nancy Vaughan was the first official to speak. People are also reading… N.C. Gov. Roy Cooper was among the other speakers to appear with Harris. Trump, Cooper said, \"wants to make history by installing himself as a dictator.\" Cooper also told the crowd that Biden provided the extra incentive money that finally helped North Carolina Republicans agree to expand Medicaid. \"Donald Trump wants to snatch those new health insurance cards right out of people's hands,\" Cooper said. Cooper commonly attends similar events, but there has also been speculation among national news media and pundits of late that if Harris were to become the Democratic nominee she might consider Cooper as her running mate. Cooper and Harris know each other from having previously served simultaneously as the attorney generals of North Carolina and California, respectively. Dudley, the scene of Harris' speech, was Greensboro's all-Black high school during segregation. Dudley first opened in 1929 and continues to educate students today. It was Greensboro’s all-black high school during segregation and some of its students participated in the famous 1960 sit-ins that helped usher in a new era of the civil rights movement. The campaign event is timely as calls for Biden to end his candidacy have grown in the wake of his dismal face-off against former President Donald Trump. A number of [Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-2024-race-democrats-who-want-him-to-step-aside) have publicly called for Biden to step aside as well as editorial boards representing major media outlets. Harris, the first female vice president, has largely been a background player in the Biden administration. However, the president’s abysmal showing during the late June debate has forced her into the position of defending Biden’s candidacy — and reaffirming hers should he step down. In previous trips to Greensboro, Harris visited Smith High School, the International Civil Rights Center, GTCC’s Advanced Manufacturing campus, and N.C. A&T University. 336-373-7002 @JessiePounds",
