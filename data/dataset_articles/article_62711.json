  "text": "The Good Life for Grand Island campaign kicked off with a press conference at the Veteran’s Sports Complex on Thursday. The campaign encourages voters to vote “for” the passage of a proposed economic development program related to the city’s newly approved Good Life District in the special election on Aug. 13. “Today starts a historic process that can improve Grand Island and build Grand Island for decades to come,” Mayor Roger Steele said. “You vote yes for the economic development program and your children and your grandchildren and future generations of Grand Islanders will have reason to thank you and look back upon you for your foresight, for your ability to see a better future for all of us.” A Good Life District was introduced as a part of the Good Life Transformational Projects Act, under Nebraska Legislative Bill 692, in early 2023. The act reduces Nebraska’s sales tax from 5.5% to 2.75% in the district for 30 years. A year later the legislature added to the program to allow districts to use local sales and occupancy taxes to invest in the area, if approved by voters. People are also reading… Woodsonia Real Estate, developers behind the Conestoga Marketplace, applied for a Good Life District in Grand Island last year. The Nebraska Department of Economic Development approved their application in June. Tonja Brown, treasurer for the Good Life For Grand Island political committee, said that this was the third district approved and, “There's only five of these allowed across the state.” The district will be in the northeast area of town, at the intersection of Capital Avenue and Webb Road to the intersection of Highway 281 and Broadwell Avenue. Included in the district will be the Veterans Sports Complex and the Conestoga Marketplace. According to Mayor Steele, the boundaries for the district could be expanded by 3,000 acres in the future. The district will go into effect on Oct. 1. However, the community will need to vote on the Good Life Economic Development Program to decide what to do with the extra money. According to [the campaign website](https://www.growgrandisland.com/goodlife), voting for the program means that voters will approve replacing the 2.75% of state sales tax with 2.75% in local sales taxes in the district. “Think about what the state is doing to invest locally,” Brown said. “I don't remember them ever stepping up like this in the past, this is absolutely amazing, it's an incredible investment by the state.” Several projects are already planned for the district; an indoor/outdoor sports complex, a commercial/business park, several housing units and enhancements to Eagle Scout Lake. If the program isn’t approved, the sales tax will still be reduced in the district. According to Brown, if the program isn’t approved then the future plans will be stalled, with everyone having to come up with a \"plan B.\" “And if those things aren't met, highly likely, this could get pulled away from us,” Brown said. “So we can say we have a Good Life District right now, but without having a program, a solid program, that makes it happen, I don't think we'll have it in the long haul.” During the press conference, Steele asked voters to vote yes, so that the money can be controlled locally, rather than going to Lincoln. “The state is giving us a chance to capture sales tax that they are giving up,” Steele said. “But to capture that sales tax, you need to vote 'yes.'” Steele also emphasized that he would like the district to eventually expand down South Locust Street to include Fonner Park. According to Steele, the expansion would not only help to develop Fonner Park to have bigger livestock shows, but help create more job opportunities and attract families and younger folks to Grand Island. “Nebraska has a problem with young people leaving our state,” Steele said. “I want to give young people a reason to stay, I want them to know that we build great opportunities for them; great jobs, great recreational opportunities, but I need your yes vote.” Diane Rouzee, the sports marketing manager for GI Tourism, also spoke in support of the program. “We need this,” Rouzee said. “We've needed this for a long time, and I wish that I would have had this 30 years ago.” With the money earned in the program, Rouzee believes the sports complex development will be good for the community, as it will not only bring more competitions to town, but people of all ages will be able to enjoy it. “I am so so excited,” Rouzee said. “I have so much passion for this town, and for sports and I think that if you can do this, you'll see amazing things happen for Grand Island.” Several of the speakers thanked Sen. Raymond Aguilar for helping to get a Good Life District in Grand Island. “I think Grand Island sold that itself,” Aguilar said. “With the numerous organizations that we have here, that are continuously working on economic development projects, you know, they could see that we were set up for this.” For the special election, registered voters in Grand Island city limits will receive a ballot in the mail. Ballots will be sent later in July, with voters either mailing in or dropping them off at the Hall County Election Commissioner’s office. All ballots must be received by 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 13. Brown suggested all mail-in ballots be sent by Aug. 6, to account for any complications. In order for the program to be approved, the majority of ballots have to be “for” the program. There is not a minimum amount of votes required. “I need your vote,” Steele said. “I ask you to tell all your friends, all your neighbors, all your relatives who live in Grand Island to vote yes for the Good Life District Development Program.”",
