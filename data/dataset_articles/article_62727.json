  "text": "Mayor Cavalier Johnson was zipping in and out of Milwaukee’s City Hall this week, shuttling his children around town, meeting with his chief of staff and watching excitedly outside as tents sprang up near the site of the Republican National Convention.\n“It’s becoming real,” said Mr. Johnson, Milwaukee’s first elected Black mayor, who sailed to a second term earlier this year.\nMr. Johnson, 37, is preparing for his biggest and trickiest role yet. He was one of the major supporters of bringing the Republican convention to Milwaukee, and next week, the crush of tens of thousands of visitors will arrive. Milwaukee, a city of about 560,000, has\nrarely hosted a convention of this size and is not accustomed to showing off on the national stage.\nIt’s a delicate juggling act for Mr. Johnson, who for a few days could also be the most visible face of the opposing party: blasting Republican policies and the rhetoric of former President Donald J. Trump, as Mr. Trump arrives in Milwaukee to accept the Republican nomination. Mr. Johnson has already shown his willingness to spar with Mr. Trump, knocking the former president for reportedly calling Milwaukee a “horrible city” in a recent meeting with House Republicans.\n“I’m a host, and I want people to have a great time here,” Mr. Johnson said in an interview. “At the same time, on the political end, I am a Democrat.”\nThe convention is a major test for Mr. Johnson, a popular young mayor who grew up in Milwaukee and attended its public schools. Before he took office in 2021, he was a member of the City Council, brimming with ambition in a relatively quiet, staid city government.\nMilwaukee’s mayors have rarely been flamethrowers. Mr. Johnson’s predecessor was Tom Barrett, a low-key executive who stayed in the job for 17 years before accepting an ambassadorship to Luxembourg under the Biden administration in 2021.\nBefore Mr. Barrett was John O. Norquist, who served from 1988 to 2004. (Marvin Pratt served briefly for several months as interim mayor in early 2004.)\nMr. Johnson has defined the office differently than his predecessors did.\n“The new mayor came in with new ideas and said, ‘It’s a new day,’” said Dale Kooyenga, a former Republican state legislator who is now the president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce. “He really took the time to walk the halls of the Capitol and spend time with folks who are nowhere near Milwaukee. He formed relationships. The previous mayor didn’t do that as much.”\nAnnie Stabler, a Milwaukee resident who worked in a factory for 45 years until it closed in March, said that Mr. Johnson was a ubiquitous cheerleader for the city, popping up at festivals, parades and events, shaking hands and working crowds.\n“You always see him everywhere — he doesn’t turn down any invitation,” Ms. Stabler said. “Almost every time I turn the TV on, the mayor is on it.”\nMr. Johnson, a Democrat with a moderate streak, has occasionally drawn the ire of his constituents. He is generally supportive of robust police budgets, bucking the segment in his party that would like to reduce funding for law enforcement. He has sought to reinstate the posting of some police officers near schools to combat reckless driving, a scourge that intensified during the pandemic along with homicides and other serious crimes.\nHis early and unwavering support for bringing the Republican National Convention to Milwaukee was met with\nscorn from some quarters in the mostly Democratic city. And his decision earlier this year to replace the city’s battle-tested elections chief, Claire Woodall, with a less experienced colleague was widely questioned, considering the high stakes of the presidential election this fall, particularly in a swing state like Wisconsin.\nShanice Jones, a 24-year-old community organizer, said that she wished the mayor would spend more time working on projects in the neighborhoods outside the city center.\n“I feel like he could be doing more for his own people, for the Black and brown community,” she said. “Sometimes it seems like he just focuses on the downtown area.”\nBut his big political victories, especially the deal he secured with the state — including the Republicans who control the state legislature — to shore up the city’s finances, seem to loom largest in voters’ assessment of him.\n“He’s a consensus guy,” said Sachin Chheda, a political consultant who ran Mr. Johnson’s first mayoral campaign. He won his recent race for re-election with more than 80 percent of the vote. After being appointed acting mayor to replace Mr. Barrett in 2021, Mr. Johnson was elected to his first full term in 2022 with more than 70 percent of the vote.\nPeggy Williams-Smith, chief executive of Visit Milwaukee, a tourism organization, first met Mr. Johnson by chance years ago when they were seated next to each other on a flight to Washington.\nSince then, he has been an ally. He helped Milwaukee win the Republican convention, she said, by engaging with the search committee, talking about why he got into politics and what it was like to grow up in Milwaukee.\nBeyond the convention, Johnson has focused on tackling vexing problems with roots in the pandemic shutdowns, said Ms. Williams-Smith. She pointed to a significant drop in the city’s violent crime rate, and a better-than-average return to the city’s downtown.\n“The mayor’s collaboration has helped with everything,” she said. “He has helped to elevate Milwaukee in a way that I haven’t seen in my half a century here.”\nHis primary goal in bringing the Republicans to Milwaukee, Mr. Johnson said, is luring other large events to the city and boosting its tourism industry.\nIn the months leading up to the convention, Mr. Johnson has been a major booster of President Biden’s run for a second term, a promoter of his party’s ideals — and quick to respond to slights aimed at Milwaukee.\nWhen reports emerged last month that Mr. Trump had called Milwaukee a “horrible city” in a private meeting with House Republicans, Mr. Johnson responded sharply.\n“If Donald Trump wants to talk about things that he thinks are horrible, all of us lived through his presidency” Mr. Johnson\nsaid during a news conference. “So, right back at you, buddy.”\nEven so, Mr. Johnson is thrilled at the thought of thousands of Republicans descending on Milwaukee.\nWhen they walk out of the convention hall, Mr. Johnson hopes that they will explore Milwaukee’s neighborhoods, including\nBronzeville, a historically Black area, and learn about the city’s diversity, which is striking for Wisconsin. (About 39 percent of Milwaukee residents are Black, 33 percent are white, and 20 percent are Latino, according to the Census Bureau.)\nHe wants people to eat cheese curds and scoops of frozen custard, and maybe indulge in a Friday night fish fry in the classic Milwaukee tradition. He hopes they will visit some of the restaurants featured in “Top Chef,” the popular cooking show that recently aired a whole season filmed in and around Milwaukee, or take in the vistas of Lake Michigan, which has a tendency to surprise visitors with its ocean-like vastness and beauty.\n“When people think about the state of Wisconsin, I want them to think of Milwaukee,” he said.\nWhether he will venture far into the Republicans’ convention hall is another question. He said that he does not expect to encounter Mr. Trump in person next week. Still, Mr. Johnson said that he would probably visit the arena at some point, at least to chat with reporters.\nThe post\n Milwaukee’s Mayor, No Fan of Trump, Is Thrilled to Host His Party appeared first on New York Times.",
