Kathy Hochul shows her skills in operating heavy machinery, with guidance from Craig Boyd, coordinator, IUOE Local 825, during a visit July 10 to IUOE Local 825’s training center in New Hampton (photo: John M. Flores) NEW HAMPTON – Governor Kathy Hochul was in Orange County on Wednesday meeting with officials from the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 825 (IUOE) in New Hampton. Hochul visited the training center to see first-hand the work members are doing to enhance labor skills, support local employment and economic development, and improve the state’s infrastructure as well as affirm her commitment to union labor and local infrastructure projects.\nThe governor was given a hands-on demonstration, including virtual reality simulator training and other innovative training tools and even took her newly acquired skills into the field to operate an excavator.\nDuring her remarks to the group, Hochul emphasized the critical role of the labor unions, particularly the operating engineers, in building the state’s infrastructure and enabling the American dream. She called on the audience to recognize the power and dignity of the union movement in the state.\n“ Union blood runs through my veins,” said Hochul, who shared her personal connection to the labor movement through her family history of electricians, plumbers, and steelworkers. “That’s why this matters so much to me. We need to keep building … keep that sense of exceptionalism that has defined New York.”\nGreg Lalevee, business manager of IUOE Local 825, commended Hochul for her “commitment to creating construction jobs and permanent positions” that provide good wages and benefits for union members.\n“Governor Hochul has an unprecedented and unrivaled track record when it comes to supporting operating engineer jobs and major infrastructure projects across New York – from the clean energy Champlain Hudson Power Express project, to the new Buffalo Stadium, the Gateway Tunnel and all of the roadway upgrades in between,” said Lalevee. “Governor Hochul also has continued to do the engineering environmental work on Route 17 – a critical path to opening up the Hudson Valley and making sure goods and services can go through here.”\nHochul said these types of projects are about connecting communities and creating opportunities for current and future generations.\n“The projects that are being done across our state – we’re unleashing potential. It’s time for a new stadium in Western New York … we’re getting that done. And Route 17, I’ve taken Route 17 many, many times. Making this part of the I-86 Interstate system … you’ll be doing that work. We need to keep re-imagining places and building those connections – whether it’s a tunnel, a highway, a bridge. You are the ones making that happen.”\nThe State Department of Transportation is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement for the Route 17 Mobility and Access Improvement Project , located between Exit 113 in Sullivan County and I-87 in Orange County. The operating engineers have joined other stakeholders, including the group “17 Forward 86,” in advocating for a third travel lane east and west and making other necessary upgrades to convert the corridor to Interstate 86.",
