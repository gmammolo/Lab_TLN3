  "text": "- India\nInternational\nChief Minister Bhupendra Patel said on Thursday that Gujarat is committed to achieving total success in quality adoption and making it the cornerstone of development in the state. He was speaking at the inauguration of Gunvatta Sankalp Gujarat, an initiative of Quality Council of India (QCI), aimed at focusing on critical quality interventions across priority sectors in the state.\nThe initiative aims to augment and support the state government’s initiatives through quality interventions, establish a foundation of quality at the grassroots level, and build a holistic quality ecosystem for Viksit Gujarat. It also aims to redefine quality standards in key areas such as education, skilling, healthcare, e-commerce, industries and MSMEs, tourism, culture and sports and social development in the state, the QCI — an independent autonomous organisation — said in a statement.\nAddressing the inaugural session in\nAhmedabad, Patel emphasised that quality was a largely ignored term in India until a few years ago, but under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the country is moving towards quality.\n“Be it Make in India, Digital India or Atmanirbhar Bharat, every movement the PM has undertaken has seen significant progress. We are focused on quality and I am confident that we will also achieve 100 per cent success in making it the cornerstone of development,” he said.\nHe added that Viksit Gujarat is being built under the 5G model – Garvu Gujarat, Gunvantu Gujarat, Green Gujarat, Global Gujarat and Gatisheel Gujarat.“Let us add one more G, Gunvatta (quality), in this 5G Gujarat model,” said Patel.\nQCI chairperson Jaxay Shah, in his address, noted the historic Salt March began from Ahmedabad, and with Gujarat Gunvatta Sankalp, “quality march” is also beginning from the city.\n“Aligned with our PM’s vision of enhancing the quality of life for every Indian, this initiative aims to embed the principles of quality in every facet of life, livelihood, and industry in Gujarat. Together, we will set new benchmarks in quality and excellence, making Gujarat the first developed state of Viksit Bharat. This is not just a commitment, but a movement towards a brighter, more prosperous future for all proud Gujaratis,” he said.\nThis was the 5th edition of Gunvatta Sankalp. Earlier editions have been held in the states of\nUttar Pradesh, Assam, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.\nThe day-long event also featured sessions on education and skilling in Gujarat; affordable and quality healthcare; future of industry and MSMEs; transforming e-commerce through targeted value addition; making Gujarat a global hub for tourism, culture and sports and the state’s quality roadmap.\nCelebrities like Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, and now Kriti Sanon have invested in properties in Alibaug, making it a hotspot for the rich and famous. Kriti has bought a 2000 sq ft plot of land in the celebrity capital, while Amitabh Bachchan owns a 10000 sq ft land in the same project.",
