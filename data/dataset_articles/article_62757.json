  "text": "WASHINGTON — Justin Trudeau has “full confidence” in his long-time political lieutenant, Chrystia Freeland, the prime minister said Thursday, in response to a report that senior advisers in the Liberal government are concerned about her performance as finance minister.\nThe Prime Minister’s Office said the story published Thursday in the Globe and Mail contains assertions that are “not accurate.”\n×\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts Asked about the story on the final day of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Washington, Trudeau did not deny its accuracy, but said he has faith in Freeland “as a close friend and ally and partner” in his government. He noted that as finance minister, she has overseen the “most ambitious housing program in Canadian history, along with the $35-billion scheme to deliver more affordable child care across the country.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW “These are all things that Chrystia has led on and will continue to do,” Trudeau said.\n“I have full confidence in her abilities and on the work we’re going to be doing together.”\nTrudeau also acknowledged, as first reported in the Star , that he has had discussions with former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney, in which they spoke about Carney joining the government as finance minister.\nTrudeau did not deny he had met with Carney, saying only that he has “been talking with Mark Carney for years now about getting him to join federal politics.\n“I think he would be an outstanding addition at the time when Canadians need good people to step up in politics,” Trudeau said.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Freeland was appointed finance minister in 2020 after the resignation of her predecessor, Bill Morneau, as the Liberal government was unleashing a massive surge in spending to prop up the economy and support Canadians during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. She also serves as deputy prime minister.\nTrudeau made his comments Thursday after the Globe and Mail reported that said senior officials in his office — including his long-serving chief of staff, Katie Telford — believe Freeland has been “ineffective” in showcasing the government’s economic plan as national polls show the Liberals have fallen far behind Pierre Poilievre’s Conservative party in public support.\n“These assertions are not accurate,” the Prime Minister’s Office’s statement said. “The Deputy Prime Minister has been working tirelessly and effectively to serve Canadians since she was first appointed to cabinet in 2015.”\nA spokesperson for Freeland did not respond to a request for comment.\nTrudeau has recently come under pressure over his party’s poor standing in the polls. After the Liberals lost a June 24 byelection to the Conservatives in the long-safe riding of Toronto—St. Paul’s, Trudeau and his team were swamped by a wave of calls for him to resign.\nSeveral veteran Liberals, including Trudeau’s former environment minister, said he should step down for the good of the party, but only one sitting member of his caucus — New Brunswick’s Wayne Long — publicly declared that he wanted Trudeau to go.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Several Liberal MPs have told the Star that the byelection loss triggered serious concerns about their party’s trajectory heading toward the next federal election campaign. Some, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said that Trudeau should resign or acknowledge that some caucus members share that view, while others went on the record to express their support for the prime minister.\nStill more have told the Star that Trudeau needs to make significant changes, possibly to his cabinet or to top staff in the Liberal party organization. Trudeau was pushed to make changes in a call with regional caucus leaders, two sources with knowledge of the conversation told the Star last week.\nTrudeau has long insisted he intends to remain as Liberal leader heading into the next election, which is currently scheduled for October 2025.\nWhile pressure over his future ramped up, some have suggested alternatives for the job. Catherine McKenna, who was in Trudeau’s cabinet for six years, has expressed support for Carney . Wayne Easter, a former long-time MP and cabinet minister who was in Trudeau’s caucus until 2021, named Carney, Housing Minister Sean Fraser and Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne as candidates he would like to see in a leadership race.\nFreeland would also be interested in joining the contest when the time comes, a senior government official told the Star earlier this year .\nNone of them has confirmed an intention to run if Trudeau steps down.\nAlex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering federal politics for the Star.
