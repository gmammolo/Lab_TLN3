  "text": "Senate President Godswill Akpabio has hailed the Supreme Court judgement granting financial autonomy to local government administrations.\nSpeaking to journalists at the State House, Abuja after a meeting with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu with Speaker Tajudeen Abbas; the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi and other senior government officials,\nAkpabio congratulated President Bola Tinubu for his initiative, stressing that the ruling marks a significant milestone in the country’s democratic journey.\n“Recall that the request was placed before the courts by the AGF because the federal government, through President Bola Tinubu, feels strongly about separation of powers and the need for autonomy of all arms of governments, so for us in the legislature, the Supreme Court has spoken and we have no option than to abide by the Supreme Court ruling.\n“I will just call on all states of the federation to respect what the Supreme Court has done and then we will go back to the legislature and see where we can dot the i’s and cross the t’s to ensure the full implementation because you know the words of the Supreme Court are like the words of the king, they cannot go down to the grown without implementation.\n“So I think this is a great day for democracy, and I congratulate the President for this initiative. I know that all Nigerians now know that local government administration is an arm of government meant for the grassroots and their money should be for the grassroots. Definitely, local governments can now undertake projects on their own. So it’s a great day for democracy and is the beginning of great things to come”, he said.\nThe Senate President urged all States to respect the Supreme Court’s decision, emphasising that the legislature will work to ensure full implementation.\nHe noted that the judgement empowers local governments to undertake projects independently, benefiting the grassroots.\nAkpabio also addressed the issue of non-conduct of local government elections by some Governors, calling for impartial elections that allow all political parties to participate.\nRelated News He expressed optimism that the Supreme Court’s decision will boost confidence in the electoral process and lead to greater democratic progress.\nThe Senate President praised the justices of the Supreme Court for their landmark ruling and reiterated the parliament’s commitment to ensuring enforceability.\nSpeaker Abbas expressed the delight of members of the lower chamber over the judgement.\nHe described the ruling as a historic moment, culminating from two years of efforts by the National Assembly to ensure local government independence through various constitutional amendments.\nHe also described it as a victory for the legislature and the nation, paving the way for functional local governments that can serve their people without interference from state governors.\nAbbas expressed optimism that the ruling will enable local governments to extend goodwill to their constituents, unhindered by the excesses of state governors. The House of Representatives welcomes this significant milestone in Nigeria’s democratic journey, he added.\nAttorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, welcomed it as “local government emancipation”.\nFagbemi expressed delight at the decision, which he believes will empower local governments to develop their areas. He emphasized that the judgement requires states to conduct elections for local government areas, placing the onus on governors to comply.\nWhile noting that the ball is in the Governors’ court, Fagbemi stressed that the judgement is clear on the consequences of non-compliance.",
