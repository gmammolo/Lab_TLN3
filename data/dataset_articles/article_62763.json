  "text": "President Bola Tinubu on Thursday affirmed that he feels the pains of workers and is concerned about improving the welfare, better wages as well as their safe and enhanced working conditions.\nHe said this in Abuja while speaking with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) led by Comrade Joe Ajaero and of the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) led by Comrade Festus Osifo, saying his administration is prioritising their concerns.\n“I pay attention to everything around me. A happy worker is a productive worker. And society depends on the productivity of the happy worker,” the President said.\nRelated News However, the President called for realistic expectations on minimum wage question, stating “You have to cut your coat according to available cloth. Before we can finalize on the minimum wage process, we have to look at the structure.”\n“Why must we adjust wages every five years? Why not two? Why not three years? What is a problem today can be eased up tomorrow. There is much dynamism to this process if we are not myopic in our approaches. We can take a surgical approach that is based on pragmatism and a deep understanding of all factors,” he stated.\nAjaero emphasised the need for an upward adjustment to the minimum wage, noting: “Between living wage and minimum wage, we need to find a balance. Things are difficult for the Nigerian workers.”",
