  "text": "The Nigeria Labour Congress has commended the Supreme Court for restoring power to the Local Governments following the ruling granting financial autonomy to LGAs.\nPresident of NLC, Comrade Joe Ajaero, in a statement on Thursday, said the Supreme Court through this landmark judgment has not only restored our democracy but possibly hope in democracy.\nAjaero said: “We at the Nigeria Labour Congress wish to commend the Supreme Court of Nigeria for restoring power to the Local Governments.\n“It is an epochal pronouncement on Thursday, July 11, 2024, directing that financial allocations be made directly to Local Governments as well as divesting state governments of power to remove local government executives is both courageous and salubrious.\n“The Supreme Court through this landmark judgment has not only restored our democracy but possibly hope in democracy.\n“Not a few believe the stunted national growth or development and the overwhelming surge in crimes and threats to our collective good is directly tied to the seizure and paralysis of local governments by state governments.\n“The journey to the Local Governments’ freedom has been a tortuous one.\nRelated News “For years we had watched with dismay and discontent the remorseless and mindless erosion of the powers of the Local Governments and had embarked on a series of national protests as workers.\n“We also note the effort made by the Buhari Administration to prise off the strangle-hold of governors on local governments. We must also mention the commendable role on this matter by the 9th Assembly.\n“This statement will not be complete without paying tribute to the Tinubu government for its presence of mind to institute this action at the Supreme Court. We specifically commend the President and the Attorney General of the Federation.\n“Judgment has been given but we are now confronted with implementation. We urge that all necessary measures be taken so that this judgment is not sabotaged at the implementation stage.\n“This brings us to the conduct of elections at local governments. Elections by SIECS have been anything but fair. The true freedom of local governments, in our view, must also come from those who govern them. Should SIECS be allowed to conduct ‘elections’ or should NEC take over (even as they are over-burdened and are not exactly the best example). Should there be a regulatory agency or commission with oversight over SIECs? We will find the devil in the details through a stakeholder conversation.\n“Finally, the freedom of local governments will be nothing if those who take charge end up behaving badly like their predecessors in power.\n“Thus, there is need for a self-purgation or a national rebirth as laws or court pronouncements alone may not be enough.”",
