  "text": "President Joe Biden along with the leaders of more than 20 countries and the European Union on Thursday formally launched a new initiative to affirm long-term support for Ukraine as it battles Russia during the final day of the NATO summit in Washington.\n“What happens to Ukraine matters, it matters to all of Europe, it matters to NATO, quite frankly it matters to the whole world,” Biden said at Thursday’s event to unveil the agreement.\nWhat You Need To Know President Joe Biden said the U.S. will be with Ukraine “every step of the way” as he sat down with the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on the final day of the 2024 NATO summit in Washington and announced a new $225 million aid package for the country The meeting kicked off several events designed to put the alliance’s commitment to the war-torn country on full display On Wednesday the alliance took a significant step of declaring Ukraine on an “irreversible path” to NATO membership in a joint statement The “Ukraine Compact” pledges to aid the country in its defense and security needs and accelerate efforts to help the country strengthen its force and build its deterrence into the coming years. It also states that after the conclusion of the current war, those who signed on to the compact will “convene swiftly and collectively at the most senior levels to determine appropriate next steps in supporting Ukraine as it exercises its right of self-defense…” in the “event of future Russian armed attack against Ukraine.”\n“Ukraine will prevail in this war and we will stand with them every single step of the way – that's what the compact says, loudly and clearly,” Biden declared.\nAfter speaking briefly, the president introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, mistakenly referring to him as “President Putin.” Vladimir Putin is the president of Russia.\nBiden appeared to realize he had switched the names afterwards, turning back and saying “President Putin? He’s gonna beat President Putin. President Zelenskyy. I’m so focused on beating Putin …”\nIt comes as Biden, 81, has been facing headwinds from some in his own party after his performance in last month's debate, which sparked a new front when it comes to questions about his age and mental fitness.\nThe launching of the new agreement Thursday was part of a series of events over this week’s summit designed to put the alliance’s commitment to the war-torn country on full display.\nEarlier on Thursday, Biden used a sit-down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to announce a new $225 million aid package for the country, which, he said, marks the eighth one he has signed off on since Congress passed a massive foreign aid bill after a monthslong standoff in the House amid GOP opposition.\n“Fact is that for the past few months, the battle for Ukraine has shifted,” Biden told Zelenskyy on Thursday, noting the country has “blunted Russia's advances.”\nThe Ukrainian leader noted that together, they are “saving lives of our people” and “preserving Ukraine's independence and freedom.”\n“And these historic actions will protect the world from similar wars,” he added.\nBiden and Zelenskyy’s individual meeting was followed by a convening of the NATO-Ukraine Council, created in 2023 after Russia’s invasion, with other leaders of the alliance’s member nations.\nUkraine has been a central focus of the alliance’s multi-day summit, which this year marked the 75th anniversary of NATO. Allies are looking to build a “bridge” to Ukraine’s own eventual ascension into the military alliance. Just before last year’s summit, Biden said now was not the time for Ukraine to join, noting such a move while it is still at war with Russia would immediately put the alliance directly at war as well, due to an article in its treaty.\nOn Wednesday, however, the alliance took a significant step of declaring Ukraine on an “irreversible path” to NATO membership in a joint statement.\nOver the course of this year’s summit, NATO partners also announced the establishment of a center to focus on training Ukrainians and supporting the flow of military aid. The alliance will also appoint a NATO Senior Representative in Kyiv that will facilitate communication between NATO and Ukrainian officials.\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday, Biden used remarks opening the summit to announce the U.S. and other NATO allies will provide Ukraine with new air defense systems . It will include patriot batteries from the U.S., Germany, and Romania; patriot components from the Netherlands and others; and a SAMP-T system from Italy, according to a joint statement.\nLeaders on Wednesday also announced that American-made F-16 fighter jets are on their way to Ukraine with the help of Denmark and the Netherlands and could be flying this summer. Biden told Zelenskyy on Thursday the move would “show the world” that we stand with Ukraine “now and in the future.”\nDuring the first session of the summit on Wednesday, the president warned allies that Russia has “significantly” ramped up production of weapons, munitions and vehicles with the help of China, North Korea and Iran.\n“We cannot allow the alliance to fall behind,” the president said.\nBiden went on to note that for the first time, every NATO member is pledging to develop plans for domestic defense production while a fact sheet from the White House notes that countries will agree to coordinate on national plans to improve industrial capacity.\n“That means, as an alliance, we’ll become more innovative and competitive – and we’re able to produce more critical defense equipment more quickly,” Biden said. “We will not be surpassed — we cannot be surpassed by anyone when it comes to our readiness.”\nIn the U.S., Biden said his administration has invested $30 billion in defense manufacturing to boost production.\nThe joint statement from the allies criticizes China as being “a decisive enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine through its so-called ‘no limits’ partnership and its large-scale support for Russia’s defence industrial base.”",
