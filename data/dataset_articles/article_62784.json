  "text": "Muhammad Irfan Published July 12, 2024 | 01:20 AM\nWashington, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 12th Jul, 2024) President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday he was confident Ukraine would eventually join NATO after the alliance said the Russian-invaded country had an \"irreversible\" path to membership.\n\"We have strong wording regarding the irreversibility of Ukraine 's movement towards NATO . Every step truly brings us closer to membership,\" Zelensky told a news conference at a NATO summit alongside the alliance 's chief Jens Stoltenberg.\n\"We are doing and will continue to do everything to ensure that the day comes when Ukraine is invited and becomes a NATO member, and I am confident we will achieve this,\" he said.\nZelensky's reaction was significantly warmer than a year ago at the NATO summit in Lithuania where he was visibly upset that there was not a firmer promise on membership.\nNATO , formed in the Cold War, is a collective defense pact in which an attack on one ally is an attack on all .\nThe United States and Germany have led concerns about quickly bringing Ukraine into NATO , believing it would effectively put them at war with nuclear-armed Russia .\nA declaration issued Wednesday at the 75th anniversary NATO summit in Washington said leaders supported Ukraine on \"its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership.\"\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has cited Ukraine 's NATO aspirations as a reason to attack the former Soviet republic, rejecting the idea that the country has a separate historical identity.",
