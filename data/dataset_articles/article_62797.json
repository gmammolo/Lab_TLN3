  "text": "THE easing of India’s rice export restrictions will benefit the Philippines, possibly allowing it to start cutting interest rates by October, according to financial services group Nomura.\nIn its report, Nomura said the Philippines, a major importer of rice, will be the “biggest winner in Asia” when India, the world’s top rice exporter, begins to ease its restrictions on rice exports.\n“Easing inflation would further support our view that [the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)] will start its easing cycle by October, although the risk of an earlier rate cut in August is rising, given recent comments by Governor Remolona that BSP does not have to wait for the Fed,” Nomura underscored.\nBSP Governor Eli M. Remolona Jr. said the reduction in rice tariffs to 15 percent from 35 percent due to Executive Order (EO) No. 62 fuels the optimism of monetary officials for a possible rate cut as early as August.\nRemolona said the Monetary Board is now “less hawkish” or “more dovish” than before, as inflation is expected to slow to the midpoint of the 2 to 4 percent target range.\n“When the price of rice goes down, it can have a significant second-round effects, especially because the price of rice is a salient price—an important price in the formation of inflation expectations,” Remolona added.\nThe Monetary Board maintained the BSP’s Target Reverse Repurchase (RRP) rate at 6.5 percent while interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities will remain at 6 percent and 7 percent, respectively, during the last policy meeting on June 27.\nNomura said India’s easing on rice exports is likely to materialize as expectations of good harvest, ample rice buffer stocks and softening of rice price inflation is seen.\nThis would lower global rice prices as India accounts for the 35 percent of rice exported globally. Asia, where rice is a staple food, will also benefit from the fall in rice prices.\nThe outlook for Asia’s rice-producing countries Thailand and Vietnam is tempered due to dry weather conditions.\n“We expect the process of easing of India’s rice export restrictions to be gradual, with better crop prospects likely to cool local rice prices, in turn leading authorities to further ease restrictions, which should have favorable spillovers on global rice prices over time,” Nomura said.\nThe Indian government is looking into allowing white rice shipments with a fixed duty and may also remove the 20-percent tax on parboiled rice exports and impose a fixed levy instead, according to a Bloomberg story.",
