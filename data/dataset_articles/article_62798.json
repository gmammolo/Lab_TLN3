  "text": "WITH less than a year before the first ever Parliamentary Elections in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), the Commission on Elections will be conducting a massive voter education campaign in the region to make sure the landmark event is held successfully.\nComelec spokesman Atty. John Rex Laudiangco said the information drive aims to make voters well-informed during the BARMM Parliamentary Election (BPE), which will coincide with the next National and Local Elections (NLE) on May 12, 2025.\n“The BARMM Parliamentary Elections is the culmination of the Bangsamoro Peoples’ decades-long struggle for recognition and self-determination. Therefore, we deem it important to educate the BARMM voters on the new voting system to ensure the success of this historic electoral exercise,” Laudiangco said in a statement Thursday.\nA highlight of the campaign spearheaded by Comelec’s Education and Information Department (EID) is the Voter Education Micro Summits, to be conducted by its voter education teams in September.\nThe summits will feature experts from the Comelec’s EID and Law Department, who will discuss the composition of the Bangsamoro Parliament, the system of proportional representation, the allocation of parliamentary seats, the manner of their election, among others.\nComelec Chairman George M. Garcia said other matters to be tackled in the information drive are how to use the Automated Counting Machines (ACM) and the two ballots that will be used in the BPE.\nThere will also be discussions on how to avoid vote-buying, terrorism and violence.\n“It is our hope that after the Summit, we will be able to secure the participating organizations commitment to help increase awareness in the Bangsamoro Parliamentary Elections,” Laudiangco said.\nA total of 80 parliamentary seats will be available in the BPE. Most or 40 of the seats will be allocated for the representatives of Regional Political Parties.\nAnother 32 seats will be for representatives of Parliamentary Districts and the last remaining eight seats are reserved for sectoral representatives namely, the Non-Moro Indigenous Peoples (NMIPs), Settler Communities, Women, Youth, Traditional Leaders and Ulama.",
