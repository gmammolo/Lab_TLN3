  "text": "By Neil Pooran ,\n23 minutes ago\nCharles Kennedy’s family are “extremely pleased” that the area of the Highlands he represented is once again a Liberal Democrat-held constituency, the new MP has said.\nAngus MacDonald won the newly formed seat of Inverness , Skye and West Ross-shire at the General Election, finishing ahead of the SNP’s Drew Hendry with a majority of 2,160.\nFormer Lib Dem leader Mr Kennedy represented Ross, Skye and Lochaber until 2015. He died shortly after losing his seat.\nMr MacDonald’s constituency was the very last to be declared due to the returning officer ordering a recount, with the results being announced on Saturday morning.\nThe former army officer is a businessman and author as well as being a Highland councillor.\nHe told the PA news agency he was hopeful of a win despite polls suggesting the seat would stay in SNP hands.\nHe said: “Not one single poll had the SNP losing, and quite a few had me behind Labour and the Conservatives.”\nAt about one o’clock on election night “the SNP’s mood went from being buoyant to being dejected” as the vote counting process suggested the Lib Dems were ahead, he said.\nThe returning officer’s decision meant the constituency, which stretches from Skye in the west to Inverness in the east, would not be formally declared until Saturday.\nBut Mr MacDonald said the result was clear at that point, saying: “The fact is, Drew Hendry conceded on the first night…\n“There was an assumption amongst almost everybody that I had won.”\nMr Hendry, who had been an MP since 2015, said it had been an “absolute joy” to represent those in the area.\nIn his concession statement, he said: “I am obviously disappointed not to be continuing that representation under the new Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire boundary and wish the new MP every success in his new role.\n“People need an MP who will fight for their needs both local and at UK level and during this cost-of-living crisis, they have never needed help and assistance more.”\nCharles Kennedy’s son Donald was supportive of Mr MacDonald’s campaign, providing him with a quote for campaign leaflets as he sought to regain the area for the Lib Dems after nine years.\nThe new MP said: “The family were extremely pleased.\n“There was no doubt at all that they felt it was great it had been reclaimed for the Liberal Democrats.”\nHe wore full highland dress, including his family MacDonald of Keppoch tartan kilt to the election count – an outfit he plans to sport again at the state opening of Parliament next week.\nMr MacDonald said there is “elation” in the Lib Dems after they took 71 seats across the UK and he will focus on improving transport and infrastructure in the Highlands.\nAfter being sworn in at Westminster he said the building was “awe-inspiring”, adding: “I’m incredibly pleased and honoured to be part of it, I must be one of the luckiest people in Britain.”\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
