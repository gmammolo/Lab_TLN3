  "text": "Had there been any doubt, Sueños Music Festival is here to stay. The Latino music festival on Thursday announced it has reached an agreement with the Chicago Parks District to extend its contract with the city to play in Grant Park for five more years. The contract also reportedly includes the option for the festival to expand from two days to three. Sueños recently presented its third annual festival in Grant Park for two days over Memorial Day weekend, with 2024 headliners including Peso Pluma, Xavi, Maluma and Ivan Cornejo. Although weather dampened the festival’s second day, it reported almost 70,00 festival-goers this year, drawing both locally and from out-of-state. Mayor Brandon Johnson and chief of staff Cristina Pacione-Zayas made an appearance on the festival’s first day. “We wanted to make sure that we welcome all the patrons and make sure that folks know that we have a deep interest in this and make sure that this festival continues on and on,” Pacione-Zayas said in part. Sueños is presented by the producers behind Baja Beach Fest, Chicago’s Reventon Promotion and C3 Presents, the Live Nation subsidiary that also presents Lollapalooza. In the announcement, it claimed an economic impact on the city amounting to $243.7 million in 2024. Lollapalooza extended its own Grant Park contract in 2022, reaching a 10-year agreement with the city in a deal championed by then-Mayor Lori Lightfoot. dgeorge@chicagotribune.com",
