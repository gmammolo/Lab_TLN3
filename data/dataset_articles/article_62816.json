  "text": "His Majesty the King instructed the King's Private Offices 904 to set up the royally initiated Jit Arsa (spirit of volunteering) project in tribute to His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great and Her Majesty Queen Sirikit The Queen Mother for their contributions to the Thai nation. Also known as Jit Arsa 904 wor por ror, the project aims to encourage unity and happiness among the people and stability for the country. In the beginning, His Majesty the King wanted the volunteer work to be carried out in communities around Dusit Palace as a public service activity. It was launched on June 21, 2017, at Sukhothai School in Bangkok's Dusit District as a small starting point and later gradually expanded its area to cover other parts of the country. The Jit Arsa operations centre was also set up in Sanam Sueapa. The Internal Security Operations Command (Isoc) serves as the coordinator of the project. It has set up a regional coordination centre in each of the four regions: the Central Plains, Northeast, North and South. Each province has a provincial Jit Arsa coordination centre that is headed by the provincial governor, who also normally serves as the head of the provincial Isoc office. These regional and provincial Jit Arsa centres coordinate activities and encourage more people to apply to become certified volunteers. A background check is needed to become a Jit Arsa volunteer. Once certified, volunteers are required to attend a formal ceremony, where they are presented with a blue cap, a yellow scarf and a Jit Arsa identification card. The ceremonies are performed in front of a portrait of His Majesty the King. Upon becoming a Jit Arsa volunteer, one is required to strictly follow the project's regulations and dedicate themselves to working for the public good. The Jit Arsa volunteers can be categorised into three groups, including \"Development Volunteers\", whose duty is to improve the quality of life of locals through many types of activities such as nature and environmental conservation, the improvement of public amenities, safety, vocations and health. \"Disaster Relief Volunteers\" help monitor and provide aid relief. The last group is \"Ad Hoc Volunteers\" who help conduct activities at ceremonial events or to receive the King on various occasions. They also work with relevant government units to facilitate public participation and prepare pre-event and venue arrangements, as well as restore normalcy to the venue after the event. Planting over 1,000 trees In March and April 2018, His Majesty the King sponsored the training of the first round of 384 Jit Arsa volunteers to teach them to be role models for other volunteers nationwide. They were provided with general knowledge, including information on how to maintain mental and physical fitness, as well as on subjects that are relevant to their volunteer activities, such as woodwork and cooking. They also get a chance to learn about the work and the sufficiency philosophy of King Rama IX. Every year the number of Jit Arsa 904 volunteers has increased. At an event in July 2019, despite cloudy skies, Vachirabenjatas Park became brighter than ever with the yellow colours and lively smiles around the area. The volunteers who came to show their devotion to His Majesty the King on his 67th birthday were the ones who brought vivid colour to lighten up the park. They all wore yellow shirts to participate in the \"We do good by heart\" tree-planting event, which was presided over by Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha. Among the volunteers were employees from various companies, as well as the National Council on Social Welfare of Thailand, celebrities and actors and students from the State Railway of Thailand Vocational School. They all shared the same resolution to perform good deeds to pay tribute to His Majesty the King. Yellow star trees, or ton ruang phueng in the Thai language, were planted in the heart of Vachirabenjatas Park, as they are the King's symbolic tree that is believed to bring luck and offer protection to the people of the Kingdom. As the trees typically bloom in July, the park will be covered with the vivid yellow of the trees' flowers during the King's birthday celebration every year. Other parts of the park were planted with 1,010 trees donated by associated organisations. Planting that many trees is hard work, especially in an area as big as this. However, none of the volunteers voiced any complaints. Instead, they wore big smiles as they dug into the ground and planted the trees. \"I signed up for the event as soon as I saw the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration's announcement at my office because my friends and I always enjoy doing volunteer work,\" said an officer of the Don Muang district office. \"Every time I finish a volunteer project like this, I feel proud of myself for doing something great for society.\" Anyone can participate To show that everyone is welcome to take part in performing good deeds, regardless of their conditions, \"We do good by heart\" became an inclusive event when it started inviting disabled students from the Chaleo-Pavana Memorial School (Chon Buri's special education school) to volunteer, along with their teachers. \"The kids were very excited when we told them they would be joining a volunteer activity outside the school,\" said a Chaleo-Pavana teacher as her students helped each other carry the young plants. Some aspects may have seemed difficult for the students, but all managed to finish planting their own trees. The students went back to their teachers with delightul smiles. \"They might work slower than other volunteers, but at least they are happy when we tell them they are doing a good deed,\" the teacher said, with a proud smile on her face. \"When they go to school tomorrow, they will tell their friends about the event, and their friends will be excited to participate in the next volunteer event too. I think that is a very good way to inspire others to volunteer for the greater good.\" The tasks in the event, however, were not just limited to planting trees. Individuals who wanted to participate in the event but preferred to do other tasks like working at the registration table or handing out snacks were also welcome to participate in the event, according to Chatramongkol Pinthong, a 24-year-old volunteer who worked at the event's registration point. Mr Chatramongkol said that during his college years at Chulalongkorn University, he would participate in volunteer projects every time he had the chance because he wanted to make society more liveable. \"I always tell other people about my volunteer experience because I want to encourage them to do the same,\" said Mr Chatramongkol. \"If our dream is to see our country, which is our home, become more beautiful and more liveable, then we should be the ones who do good deeds in order to make that dream come true.\"",
