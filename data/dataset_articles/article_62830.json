  "text": "Statement from Sung Poblete, PhD, RN, CEO of FARE, on Advancement in the House Toward Adding Peanut-Containing Foods to WIC Food Packages for Infants “FARE is thrilled to announce to U.S. parents of infants that an amendment to add peanut protein to WIC infant food packages (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) has passed the House Appropriations Committee and will be heading to the House floor for a vote. Research clearly demonstrates that the introduction of peanut protein early and often to infants starting at 4-6 months of age can prevent the development of a potentially life-threatening peanut allergy. Including peanut protein in WIC infant food packages is an important resource to offer to America’s most economically vulnerable families, helping to reduce the risk of infants developing this chronic disease and prevent it long-term. FARE worked diligently with Congressional Food Allergy Research Caucus Vice-Chair Representative Ben Cline (R-VA-6) to draft and introduce this important amendment and urges the House to pass this bill.” — Sung Poblete, PhD, RN CEO of FARE Media Contact: About FARE FARE (Food Allergy Research & Education) is the nation’s leading non-profit engaged in food allergy advocacy and the largest food allergy charity supporting research. FARE’s innovative education, advocacy and research initiatives transform the future of food allergy through new and improved treatments and prevention strategies, effective policies and legislation, and novel approaches to managing the disease.
