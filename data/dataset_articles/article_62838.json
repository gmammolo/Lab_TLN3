  "text": "CEI to Recognize Entrepreneurship and George Will’s Promethean Contributions at Julian L. Simon Memorial Dinner in September\nThe Competitive Enterprise Institute (\nCEI) is pleased to announce award winners and speakers for the annual Julian L. Simon Memorial Award Dinner on Thursday, September 19 in Washington, D.C.\nThe 2024\nJulian L. Simon Memorial Award will be presented to Magatte Wade, an entrepreneur, author, and speaker dedicated to unlocking prosperity in Africa through entrepreneurship and innovation. The award honors Julian Simon’s vision of mankind as the ultimate resource by recognizing current, exceptional work advancing that vision. A native of Senegal, Wade is the author of “ The Heart of A Cheetah: How We Have Been Lied to about African Poverty, and What That Means for Human Flourishing” (2023) and co-founder of Prospera Africa.\nFor the second time in its 40-year history, CEI will also present the Prometheus Award for Human Achievement. The 2024 winner is Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist George F. Will, who writes a twice-weekly column for the Washington Post on politics and domestic and foreign affairs and is the author of “\nAmerican Happiness and Discontents: The Unruly Torrent 2008-2020” (2021) and “ The Conservative Sensibility” (2019) among other books. The award recognizes Mr. Will’s lifetime contributions to intellectual, political, and civic life. He will deliver the keynote address to dinner attendees.\n“We are excited to recognize two individuals who have made invaluable contributions to humanity,” said CEI President and CEO Kent Lassman. “Magatte Wade gives voice to entrepreneurs everywhere who are failed by state institutions. She is a fierce advocate for Africans, Senegalese women, and anyone willing to take a risk to improve the lives of others through free enterprise. Her work exemplifies the legacy of Julian Simon and is a testament to the age-old formula that human dignity plus accountability leads to greater prosperity for all.\n“George F. Will is a civic, intellectual, and political titan of our age. Prometheus sparked the flame that gave rise to civilization and Will lights the fire of moral imagination required for free people to pursue their own life, in their own way.”\nThe event on September 19 will celebrate CEI’s 40th anniversary and will be held at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. CEI’s Jessica Melugin will emcee the event. This year, our theme will celebrate “\nPrometheus: Rebel for Humanity,” the titan who stole fire from the gods to deliver knowledge, progress, technology, empathy, and civil society to humankind.\nEvent information:\nJulian L.
