  "text": "Jaipur: A student of Rajasthan University has come up with an innovative way to campaign for resumption of student union elections in the state. Shubham Rewar, who himself aspires to contest RU’s student body elections, has started collecting letters from former presidents of Rajasthan University Student Union (RUSU), which he will send to the state govt.So far, he has obtained letters from Gyan Singh Choudhary, the first president of RUSU, Malviya Nagar MLA Kalicharan Saraf and Nagaur MP Hanuman Beniwal, both former RUSU presidents, and 15 others, including Jitendra Shrimali, BJP councillor of JMC-Greater. Rewar said, “Student body elections are a launchpad for young and emerging politicians. Numerous politicians who prevail in our political ecosystem started their journey from student body elections.
