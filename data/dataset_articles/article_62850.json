  "text": "Jaipur: Congress MLAs Bheem Raj Bhati and Shikha Meel Barala on Thursday praised the various projects announced for their constituencies in the state Budget, and expressed gratitude to chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma and finance minister Diya Kumari. Bhati thanked the CM and the finance minister for the development projects announced for his constituency, Pali. He said, “I salute both Diya Kumari ji and the CM. I salute her because despite being a woman and hailing from a wealthy family, she presented such a Budget. I salute the CM for appointing her as the finance minister.” Barala praised the finance minister for announcing pink bio-toilets for women in the Budget, increasing mess allowances in govt sports hostels, and proposals for the civil aviation sector. She welcomed the decision to allocate Rs 7 crore for building five main roads in her constituency, Chomu.An argument ensued between the leader of Opposition, Tikaram Jully, and BJP MLA Srichand Kriplani when the former in jest termed the BJP MLAs as 'Bhajan Mandali'. When Kriplani opposed it, Jully said the CM was the leader of the House, and therefore, BJP MLAs were a part of 'Bhajan mandali'. tnnWe also published the following articles recentlyTOI interview: One budget, opportunities for all, says Rajasthan finance minister Diya KumariLearn about Rajasthan's ambitious budget goals outlined by finance minister Diya Kumari.
