  "text": "Excelsior Correspondent SUCHETGARH, July 11: J&K Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary and DDC Member Suchetgarh, TS Tony has urged the Lt Governor Manoj Sinha to waive off the electricity bills of the farmers residing closer to zero-line (IB). He said that the farmers residing in the sensitive border areas playing a crucial role in bolstering the morale and operational capabilities of the armed forces and BSF during challenging border situations. During this visit to BOP Chhawani at zero line along the India-Pakistan border in Sei Khurd Panchayat, Tony emphasized the invaluable contribution of zero line farmers, highlighting their steadfast support to the security forces deployed in these critical zones. He underscored the waiving off their electricity bills would not only alleviate their financial strain but also enhance their ability to sustain agricultural activities vital to the region’s economy and security. “Zero line farmers are the backbone of our border defence strategy, providing essential support to our brave soldiers and security personnel. It is imperative that we recognize and support their sacrifices by ensuring they are not burdened with unnecessary financial obligations,” he added. The senior Congress leader further stressed that easing the financial burden on these farmers would reinforce the Government’s commitment to enhancing border security efforts and ensuring the well-being of those living in sensitive border regions. He urged Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha to consider this proposal earnestly, emphasizing that it would not only benefit the farmers directly but also contribute significantly to the overall security infrastructure of the region. Earlier, DDC Member along with officials from the PDD including XEn Ashok Chibber, AEE Rajiv Kaul conducted a visit to the areas along India-Pakistan border at BOP Chhawani in Sai Khurd and Sei Kalan in Suchetgarh constituency and took stock of damaged poles, which affected electricity infrastructure in the area.
