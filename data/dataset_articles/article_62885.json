  "text": "The new equipment acquired for SK Sungai Pinang.\nSIBU (July 12): SMK Chung Cheng, SK Sungai Pinang and SJK(C) Tai Tung No. 2 recently had their facilities upgraded with funds from the Sibu parliamentary ‘Program Mesra Rakyat’ (PMR).\nSibu MP Oscar Ling said the upgrading works included the installation of new equipment and hardware facilities for these schools.\nFor SMK Chung Cheng, he said the allocation was used to buy audio equipment, water dispensers and projectors, allowing teachers and students to study with the basic equipment.\nSK SK Sungai Pinang, meanwhile, received new speakers, laptop computers, mobile speakers, iron cabinets, printers, microphones, drawer file cabinets, iron frames, zinc tiles and projectors.\nFor SJK(C) Tai Tung No. 2 located in Sungai Empawah, he said the funds were used to acquire desks for students and upgrade the school’s learning equipment.\n“All these efforts show the Unity Government’s concern to upgrade school equipment and hardware facilities so teachers can teach more effectively,” Ling said in a statement.",
