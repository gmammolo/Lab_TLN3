  "text": "US President Joe Biden said he was the \"most qualified\" American to take on Donald Trump in November's presidential election as he faced growing calls from within his own party to step down.\n\"I think I'm the most qualified person to run for president. I beat him once, and I will beat him again,\" Mr Biden said during a high-stakes press conference, adding that he is \"not in this for my legacy\" but to \"complete the job I started.\"\nHowever the US president mixed up the name of his vice president, Kamala Harris, and his republican rival Donald Trump at the news conference where the 81-year-old aims to quell concerns that he is too old to run for re-election.\n\"Look, I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president if she was not qualified to be president. So start there,\" Mr Biden said as he responded to a question fromReuters about his confidence in Harris.\nWe need your consent to load this comcast-player content We use comcast-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

Manage Preferences\nThat came a few hours after Mr Biden mistakenly referred toUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as \"President Putin.\"\n\"And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine,who has as much courage as he has determination, ladies and gentlemen, President Putin,\" Mr Biden said at the NATO summit in Washington, drawing gasps from those in the room.\n\"Going to beat President Putin, President Zelenskiy. I am so focused on beating Putin,\" Mr Biden said while correcting himself.\nMr Biden faces growing doubts from donors, supporters and fellow democrats, who fear he no longer has the ability to beat Republican Donald Trump in the November election, or to lead the country for another four-year term.\nMr Biden's campaign has been on the ropes for two weeks, since his poor debate performance against Donald Trump, his 78-year-old Republican rival.\nJoe Biden mixed up the name of his vice president Kamala Harris with that of his November rival So far, 13 of the 213 democrats in the House and one of the Senate's 51 democrats have appealed publicly to the president to withdraw from the race. More could make their concerns public if he fares poorly in his press conference.\nBiden coughed frequently and occasionally garbled his responses at the outset of the news conference, but his responses grew steadier as he fielded questions from reporters.Biden overcame a childhood stutter and has frequently mangled names and misspoke throughout his political career.\n'Pace myself'\nHe said he needed to \"pace myself\" a little more and complained that his aides sometimes overscheduled him.\n\"I'm catching hell from my wife,\" he said.\nThe news conference gave Mr Biden an opportunity to touthis successes on the world stage and criticise Mr Trump. Mr Biden argued that his election rival would weaken NATO and drive up prices for US consumers by imposing steep tariffs on imported goods.\nMr Biden took credit for bringing Sweden and Finland into the NATO alliance, and said he brought together 50 nations to support Ukraine.\n\"I think I'm the best qualified person to do the job. To make sure that Ukraine does not fall,\" he said.\nUnited Auto Workers union officials met to discuss their concerns with his candidacy, three sources familiar with the matter said, after endorsing Mr Biden in January.The 400,000-member union has a big presence in industrial states like Michigan that Mr Biden will need to carry to win re-election.\nMr Biden advisers met with Senate democrats to try to quell further defections. His campaign argued that the debate has not dramatically shifted the race, even as it laid out a narrow path to re-election that acknowledged that it faced an uphill climb in many states he won in 2020.\nThat did not stop four more democrats in the House of Representatives called on Mr Biden to end his campaign: Brad Schneider of Illinois, Greg Stanton of Arizona, Ed Case of Hawaii, and Hillary Scholten of Michigan.\n\"For our country's sake, it is time for the President to pass the torch to a new generation of leaders,\" Stanton said in a prepared statement.\n‘I doubt the president’s judgement’\nOthers stopped short of calling for Mr Biden to drop out, even as they questioned his ability to lead the country. \"I doubt the president’s judgement about his health, his fitness to do the job, and whether he is the one making important decisions about our country, rather than unelected advisors,\" Representative Marie Gluesenkamp Perez said in a statement.\nJoe Biden's has faced increasing pressure from democrats to step down his re-election campaign None of the party's leaders in Congress have called for Mr Biden to end his candidacy, though former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday declined to say he should stay in the race.\nThe campaign has commissioned a survey to test how Vice President Kamala Harris would fare if she were to replace Mr Biden at the top of the ticket, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week found Ms Harris would fare no better than Mr Biden if she were the democratic nominee, as both were statistically tied with Mr Trump.\nProminent donors like actor George Clooney have called on Mr Biden to drop out, and there were signs that concerns are growing within Mr Biden's campaign operation as well.\nThe New York Times reported that some longtime advisers were considering ways to convince him to drop his reelection bid,while NBC News reported that some campaign staffers thought he stood no chance of winning the election.",
