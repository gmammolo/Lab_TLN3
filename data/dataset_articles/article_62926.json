  "text": "Excelsior Correspondent JAMMU, July 11: The Jammu and Kashmir National Conference today paid glowing tribute to Madr-e-Meharban Begum Akbar Jehan Abdullah on her 24th death anniversary during a programme held at party office here today. On the occasion, Ajay Sadhotra, additional general secretary and former minister, Rattan Lal Gupta, Provincial president and Sheikh Bashir Ahmed, Provincial secretary Jammu, Babu Rampaul Central Zone president and former minister along with party leaders and workers, paid glowing tribute to Begum Abdullah. Today’s programme was organized by Bimla Luthra, State vice president of the JKNC Women Wing and former MLA, to commemorate the death anniversary of Madr-e-Meharban. Earlier GH Malik organized Quran Khawani on this occasion. A two-minute silence was observed as a mark of respect to the memory of Madr-e-Meharban. Speaking on the occasion, Sadhotra criticized the current Government for its failure to empower women in Jammu and Kashmir. He accused the BJP Government at the Centre and the Union Territory Administration of providing nothing but lip service, leaving the women of J&K neglected and underserved. Rattan Lal Gupta, recalled the role of Madr-e-Meharban as a conscience-keeper of the party during the political struggle of Jammu and Kashmir, particularly after the arrest of Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah. He said Begum Abdullah led the National Conference at a very crucial juncture of the political evolution of Jammu and Kashmir when Late Abdullah was in prison. He emphasized that Madr-e-Meharban proved to be an affectionate mother, a dynamic leader, and a great human being who had a deep concern for the welfare and well-being of the people. He said Begum Abdullah will always remain an inspiration for the women of the state. Bimla Luthra recalled the contribution of Begum Abdullah to women’s emancipation and empowerment and said the best tribute to her would be to concentrate on improving the status of women and ensuring their dignity at all costs. Among others who were present include- Master Noor Hussain, Pardeep Bali, Ankush Abrol, Vijay Lochan, Abdul Gani Teli, Satwant Kour Dogra, Vijay Laxami Datta, Shamim Begum, Chander Mohan Sharma, Raghbir Singh Manhas, Sudagar Gupta, Rakesh Singh, Mohinder Singh, Ashok Kumar Attri, Vikram Puri and others.",
