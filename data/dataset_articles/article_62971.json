  "text": "State Rep. Tram Nguyen honored State Rep. Tram T. Nguyen was named one of the Emerge Massachusetts’ “Women of the Year” on June 25. The event, hosted at Foley & Lardner in Boston, is in its seventh year and celebrates the achievements of Democratic female leaders in Massachusetts.\nNguyen, who is in her third term serving the 18th Essex District, is a first-generation Vietnamese American immigrant, and the first person in her family to graduate from college and law school.\n“I am proud to stand beside the three other incredible women being honored – but also I am proud of the over 500 women who have trained through this program in the past 16 years,” Nguyen said. “We are all part of a family, a sisterhood of women who are working to build stronger communities – to create policy that better serves the people of Massachusetts and the country.”\nLowell Farmers’ Market LOWELL — Shop fresh and local at the Lowell Farmers’ Market on Friday, July 12, from 2 to 6 p.m., 350A Dutton St., in front of the Hamilton Canal Garage.
