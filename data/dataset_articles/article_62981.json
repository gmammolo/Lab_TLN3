During a NATO Summit press conference, Biden emphasized ongoing economic progress, job creation, and addressing corporate greed. He dismissed concerns about his schedule and reiterated the need to complete his work. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Washington DC | Updated: 12-07-2024 06:55 IST | Created: 12-07-2024 06:55 IST - Country: - United States US President Joe Biden on Thursday reiterated his determination to seek reelection against his Republican rival Donald Trump, dismissing any notion that a \"stupid mistake\" would alter his course. During a press conference at the conclusion of the NATO Summit, Biden affirmed his confidence in winning, stressing no poll or person is indicating otherwise. \"I'm determined on running,\" Biden stated. \"I believe I'm the most qualified person for the presidency, having beaten Trump once, and I'm prepared to do so again.\" Addressing concerns about current poll numbers, Biden noted historical precedents where previous presidents had lower ratings during their campaigns. Biden highlighted economic achievements, including the creation of over 800,000 manufacturing jobs, and emphasized the ongoing need to support working-class Americans and curb corporate greed. He contended that corporate profits, which have doubled since the pandemic, need to be regulated. Biden refuted reports suggesting he requested an earlier end to his schedule, advocating instead, for a smarter pacing of his day. (Disclaimer: With inputs from agencies.)
