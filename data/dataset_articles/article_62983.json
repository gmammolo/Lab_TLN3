  "text": "The Albanese Government is delivering $1.3 million in funding through the Future Drought Fund to support rural, regional and remote communities across Australia better prepare for drought. The Small Network Grants Round 2 will support 46 projects to host events, training initiatives, build networks, and develop infrastructure to make it easier for communities to manage drought conditions. Broken Hill Community FM Association Inc in New South Wales will receive funding for a back-up power source to continue radio broadcasts during power outages, and drought proof their Menindee site. Katherine Town Council in the Northern Territory will use their funding to hold professionally facilitated mental health workshops and three months of online sessions to give women the tools they need during tough times like drought. South Myall Catchment Landcare Group Inc in Toowoomba, Queensland will deliver workshops to improve knowledge and understanding so landholders are better insulated for drought.
