  "text": "NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday exhorted trainee IAS officers of the 2022 batch, attached as assistant secretaries in various central ministries and departments, to be catalytic agents and work with a saturation approach while implementing beneficiary schemes of govt.Interacting with the assistant secretaries at Sushma Swaraj Bhavan here, the PM said that with New India no longer okay with lackadaisical approach and demanding proactiveness, they should endeavour to provide best possible governance and quality of life to all citizens.\"It is your choice whether to be speed-breakers or superfast highway in service delivery,\" he told the trainee officers while asking them to be catalytic agents who feel satisfaction upon seeing change happen in front of their eyes. Stating that 'nation first' was not just a slogan but his life's aim, the PM asked the young trainees to walk with him in this journey.As some of the officers shared their experiences from the training they received as assistant secretaries, Modi recalled the earlier interaction with them as part of the Aarambh programme in 2022. He said the intent behind the assistant secretaries programme was to provide the officers the opportunity of experiential learning from the top to bottom of the administrative pyramid.Referring to schemes like Lakhpati Didi, Drone Didi, PM Awas Yojana etc, he asked the trainees to work with a saturation approach to take these schemes further to the people, adding that it shall ensure social justice and prevent discrimination. tnn",
