  "text": "President Clooney. It’s got a nice ring to it.\nThe Hollywood superstar took a stand this week against the sitting US President. After hosting a multi-million-dollar fundraiser for Joe Biden just three weeks ago, Clooney voiced the concerns of a nation, declaring the 81-year-old is not the “Joe ‘big F***ng deal’ Biden” he used to be.\nHe dug the boot in further, writing in a New York Times op-ed: “I love Joe Biden. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him … but the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.”\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app:\nDownload today\nSo, could the Nespresso-fuelled silver fox step up instead? It’s improbable, but not impossible. The US has form.\nIn January 1966, Ronald Reagan announced his candidacy for the California governorship. He had dipped a toe into politics previously with various stump speeches supporting the Republicans, but for this campaign he pitched himself as a political outsider. That strategy would eventually lead him all the way to the White House, winning the presidential race in 1980 and serving for two terms.\nThen there was that reality TV personality who turned to politics, and triumphed. We know that story all too well, with the next chapter yet to be written.\nWhich brings us back to Biden and the 2024 campaign.\nThe first debate was a total disaster. According to CNN, Donald Trump made 30 false claims during the televised debate but, due to the format, was not challenged on any of them by the moderators.\nJoe Biden fared even worse. He came across as wooden, stilted and even confused at some points, mixing up “billion” for “million” and pausing for long periods.\nAlarms bells started ringing in Washington, DC well before the 90-minute debate wrapped up, with calls to replace Biden immediately before the all-important Democratic Convention on August 19.\nOn Friday morning AEST, we followed the build-up on\nSunrise to the president’s first press conference in eight months. First it was delayed and then before it even started, Biden committed a disastrous diplomatic faux pas at NATO. The US president accidentally called the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky the name of his arch-rival, Vladimir Putin while introducing him.\nIt was the start of a very average day.\nThe press conference began with a statement on NATO, punctuated by coughing.\nThen came the first question from a Reuters journalist where, straight off the bat, Biden confused Trump with his own Vice President Kamala Harris. He improved from there, but it wasn’t as free-form as you’d hope from the leader of the Free World.\nSo where does that leave the US? What about President George? He’s got the health care experience from ER, security expertise from Batman, and could even offer some help to NASA after starring in Solaris.\nIt’s also an attractive double act with International Human Rights Lawyer, Amal Clooney an impressive candidate for First Lady.\nOf course, I am joking. But, suddenly, the world isn’t laughing anymore as America nervously awaits the November election.",
