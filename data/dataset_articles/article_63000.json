It found that Minneapolis, Minnesota, is the happiest city in the United States and the only U.S. city to earn a coveted Gold ranking, alongside cities in Europe, Asia, New Zealand, and Canada. As Im an East Coast transplant who fell in love with Minnesota during a 16-month, 40-state, 229-city road trip across America, this came as no surprise. My adopted hometown since 2018 has access to nature that is next-level, with most Minneapolitans living within six minutes of a public park or green space; our citizenry is diverse and civically engaged; our art, culture, and restaurant scenes rival those of cities five times our size; gobs of top companies (General Mills, Target, Best Buy, etc.) are headquartered here; and our international airporta hub for Delta and Sun Country Airlinesis one of the most efficient and well-connected in the country. And while I have long known what makes Minneapolis so great, now there is empirical data to back it up. The Institute for Quality of Life, a project by Happy City Hub, studies issues related to the well-being of community members. That includes residents, workers, parents, children, students, seniors, and others. Analysis of community-impacted decision-makingsuch as the creation of social policies and implementation of public servicesfactors heavily into its research, as do the ways in which cities react to various crises and challenges. Thirty-seven global cities earned Gold rankings in the 2024 Happy City Index. Minneapolis stood out in a sea of mostly European and Scandinavian winners, including Zurich, Amsterdam, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Vienna, and Stockholmthe highest marks were given to the city of Aarhus, the second-largest city in Denmark, situated on the countrys eastern coast. The Silver and Bronze rankings saw a much greater number of U.S. cities, including Boston, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, Portland, Oregon, and fellow Midwesterners Rochester, Minnesota, and Madison, Wisconsin.\"...(more) Info View thread info, including edit history Trash Put this thread in your Trash Can (My DU » Trash Can) Bookmark Add this thread to your Bookmarks (My DU » Bookmarks) 0 replies, 50 views Share Get links to this post and/or share on social media Alert Alert this post for a rule violation Powers There are no powers you can use on this post Edit Cannot edit other people's posts Reply Reply to this post Edit Cannot edit other people's posts Rec (0) Reply Reply to this post Reply to this discussion https://pmatep5f7b.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ProdStage Latest Discussions » General Discussion » Minneapolis ranked happie...
