  "text": "A rally outside NSW Labor headquarters on July 10, organised by Stop the War in Palestine – Sydney, expressed support for Western Australian Senator Fatima Payman. It was addressed by trade union and student activists, as well as Lachlan Good, who resigned from Labor over its poor treatment of Payman, including its refusal to implement policy to recognise the state of Palestine. “I resigned from the ALP last week, after being a member for many years and an office bearer, in reaction to the resignation of Senator Payman and the disgusting treatment she has faced from the parliamentary caucus,” Good said. “Recognition of the Palestinian state is ALP policy … as determined by the national conference, by its delegates elected by affiliated unions and rank and file members.” For Labor MPs to refuse to implement that binding policy and to pressure Payman to resign was “disgusting”, Good said, adding that it “betrays its basic values, its democratically elected delegates and its members”. Teacher unionist and member of the Teachers and School Staff for Palestine (NSW) Olivia Serougi, urged other members of Labor to follow Payman’s lead and “break ranks with the Labor leadership”. “The Labor government should recognise the state of Palestine. They should expel the Israeli ambassador,” she said. “Our government should impose immediate sanctions on Israel. “Every time Israel massacres civilians, every time Israel burns children alive, [Palestinians] look around the world to countries like Australia for consequences. Yet none come and so the horror just continues.”",
