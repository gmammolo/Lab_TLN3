  "text": "There are now eleven Sikh Labour MPs following the election on 4 July Three West Midlands MPs are among a record number of Sikh MPs elected or re-elected at the recent general election, according to a Labour MP. Preet Kaur Gill was the first Sikh woman to be elected to the Commons when she initially won the Birmingham Edgbaston seat in 2017. She told BBC Radio WM it was a privilege and an honour to take up the role and to see more Sikh MPs in Parliament. She said there was still a lot to do, however, to better serve the British Sikh community. “It’s absolutely brilliant to see a record level of Sikh representation in Parliament, the Labour party now has 11 Sikh members of Parliament,” she said. “There is lots to do for the Sikh community – one of the biggest issues is the inequalities that they face across public services.” Sonia Kumar, who has been elected to the newly formed Dudley constituency, said she was pleased that young Sikhs now had more role models. “Representation really matters,” she said. “When you look up you want to see people in those positions and feel like you’re able to attain those as well.” She hoped pictures of the 11 standing together in parliament would inspire others to stand for election in the future. “We’re just really honoured, really privileged to all be elected and we can’t wait for the next few weeks ahead to start our journey,” she said. She added that the staff in Parliament had been helpful and understanding with the new cohort. Representing all constituents Wolverhampton West MP Warinder Juss said his first few days had been like a whirlwind. He similarly praised the friendly and welcoming reception new MPs had received from staff in Westminster. “My immediate priority is to set up an office in Wolverhampton, get staff in and start helping constituents as I’ve always wanted to do.” MPs needed to be representative of their constituency, he said, adding that Wolverhampton had a significant Sikh population. Mr Juss represents the constituency formerly represented by Enoch Powell, who supported a ban on Sikh bus drivers wearing turbans to work in the 1960s. He said: “It is a great honour. To be a Sikh, to be a turban Sikh, as an MP.” He said the big challenges people raised while he was canvassing included crime and antisocial behaviour, the cost of living and education – and that he would work for people of any faith or none. There was also a record number of Muslim MPs elected this year, according to the Labour Muslim Network. Among them in the West Midlands are Zarah Sultana for Coventry South, Shabana Mahmood for Birmingham Ladywood and Tahir Ali for Birmingham Hall Green and Moseley. Also among the Muslim MPs elected in the West Midlands is independent MP Ayoub Khan for Birmingham Perry Barr. Follow BBC Birmingham on Facebook, X and Instagram.
