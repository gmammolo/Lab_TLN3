  "text": "LONDON — England’s first top finance minister was a man: “Henry the Treasurer,” a wealthy landowner from Hampshire who served King William the Conqueror after his invasion of 1066. Every subsequent chancellor of the exchequer — the archaic name for the nation’s finance ministry established in the 12th century — has also been a man. Until now. From humble beginnings, Rachel Reeves, a former chess prodigy, Oxbridge graduate and Bank of England economist, now hopes to turn the U.K.’s finances around as the first woman ever to take on the role.",
