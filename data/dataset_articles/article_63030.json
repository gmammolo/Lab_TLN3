  "text": "President William Ruto on Thursday fired his entire Cabinet save for Prime CS Musalia Mudavadi. Ruto said he had reached the decision after keenly listening to what people were saying and after gauging the performance of his Cabinet. Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga says he has been vindicated after President William Ruto on Thursday fired his entire Cabinet save for Prime CS Musalia Mudavadi. Ruto said he had decided after keenly listening to what people were saying and after gauging the performance of his Cabinet. Nilisema aje? (What did I say?) Vindicated! Anguka nayo(drop with it),” Kahiga said on X. The governor had on Wednesday appealed to the President to listen to the voice of reason and do what had been demanded of the Gen Z and rid his government of people they deemed unsuitable to hold office. “I wish to, with a lot of humility and respect, address my President Dr William Samoei Ruto and tell him Mr President, there are men and women around you who you could be calling advisors but you are in the hole you are today because of the misadvise they have given you,” Kahiga said. Speaking in Nyeri county, the governor asked the President to seize the moment and after careful introspection make a wise decision in line with what was being demanded of him by the masses. “It does not matter who is close to you, in politics it’s your skin that matters and this is a nation whose existence and survival are in your hands. It’s important for you now to take action, the best action that you think should be taken,” he said. Kahiga asked the President to evaluate the direction the country was taking in light of the recent Gen Z-driven protests to help him make an informed choice. He said the President had made so many promises before coming to office and they were not going to be achieved in the prevailing atmosphere. “The Gen Z have made demands, you engaged with them, they told you what they wanted, none of the demands was for you to put up 150 teams to negotiate. They have clearly told you we don’t want you to do this, they want you to do this, it’s that simple,” he said. “If they say that you reorganise your Cabinet, kindly do. If they say you sack it, do it,” he added. Before the sacking of his Cabinet, Ruto had on Tuesday announced that the National Multi-Sectoral Forum would begin talks on Monday, July 15 to address the issues raised by Gen Z. The youth, however, declined and demanded that the issues that were affecting the country like the audit of public debt and employment of intern doctors did not require dialogue. While sending his Cabinet home, Ruto said he had keenly listened to what the people of Kenya have said and “decided to dismiss with immediate effect all the Cabinet Secretaries and the Attorney-General from the Cabinet of the Republic of Kenya except the Prime Cabinet Secretary and Cabinet Secretary for Foreign and Diaspora Affairs”. Ruto assured the country that government operations would continue uninterrupted under the guidance of Principal Secretaries and other relevant officials as he immediately embarked on extensive consultations to set up a broad-based government. “I will be announcing additional measures in due course,” Ruto said.
