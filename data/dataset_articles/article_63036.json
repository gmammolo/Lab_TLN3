  "text": "[](/u/MarianaaFX/)\nGold price increased strongly\n[OANDA:XAUUSD](/symbols/XAUUSD/)Gold Spot / U.S. Dollar\nGold prices soared with a stunning surge of $43.8, reaching an impressive $2,414.5 per ounce. This 1% rise propelled global gold prices to a six-week high, once again surpassing the $2,400 per ounce threshold. The catalyst? A fresh inflation report that bolstered the expectation of an early interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).\nIn the wake of this report, the U.S. dollar tumbled to its lowest point in over a month, while the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds plummeted to a four-month low. The growing speculation that the Fed might slash interest rates at their upcoming policy meeting on July 30-31 has ignited a powerful rally in gold prices.\nLooking at the broader trends in monetary policy and gold demand, this surge in the precious metal's value shows no signs of slowing down.\nIn the wake of this report, the U.S. dollar tumbled to its lowest point in over a month, while the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds plummeted to a four-month low.
