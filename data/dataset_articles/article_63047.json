Further in a post on X, Chancellor Nehammer acknowledged the dedication and hard work of numerous individuals and teams, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Federal Army, the police, protocol officers, and many others behind the scenes. He thanked them for their professional planning, organization, and execution of the visit. \"In order for a state visit as big as that of @narendramodi to Austria to work, dozens of employees are intensively busy for weeks.

PM Modi visited Russia followed by Austria It should be mentioned here that PM Modi first travelled to Russia, where he participated in the 22nd India-Russia summit with President Vladimir Putin, in his first trip to Moscow since the Ukraine conflict. During his visit, he told Russian President Putin that a solution to the Ukraine conflict is not possible on the battlefield, and peace talks do not succeed amidst bombs, guns and bullets. From Moscow, Modi travelled to Austria, on June 9 becoming the first Indian Prime Minister to visit the country in 41 years. (With inputs from agencies) ALSO READ:",
