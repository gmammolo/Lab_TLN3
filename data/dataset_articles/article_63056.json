  "text": "Canada will reach the benchmark that requires Nato countries to spend at least 2% of their GDP on the military by 2032, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said. Speaking at the Nato summit in Washington DC, Mr Trudeau also hit back at those using a \"crude mathematical calculation\" to criticise an ally that \"continually punches above its weight\". As the military alliance marks its 75th anniversary, pressure has been mounting for members to meet the spending target set out by its doctrine.\nCanada currently spends 1.34% of its GDP on its military. The Nato founding member places seventh overall among 32 nations in the amount of money it spends on defence. But using the 2% metric, America's northern neighbour is ahead of only Slovenia, Turkey, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg in the 32-member alliance. By contrast, the UK spends just over 2% of its GDP on its military, while the US spends nearly 3.5%.\nFrustration with Canada was made clear in a letter sent in May to Mr Trudeau by 23 bipartisan US senators, who urged the country to immediately develop a plan to increase its spending. Some US lawmakers have more bluntly criticised Canada over its Nato benchmark shortfall. “They have the safety and security of being on our border and not having to worry about that. I think that’s shameful,\" Republican US House Speaker Mike Johnson said this week. \"I think if you’re going to be a member nation and participant, you need to do your part.”",
