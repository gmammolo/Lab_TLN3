  "text": "Kesbewa UNP organiser Ranil Willaddarage said on Tuesday that President Ranil Wickremesinghe who managed the economic crisis in the country successfully should be made President. Willaddarage also said that he has over 15 year experience as an entrepreneur and he is striving to make President Wickremesinghe victorious at the forthcoming Presidential election. He said so at the opening of his election office at Thumbowila in Piliyandala. He said that the country needs a new political culture devoid of party politics to get the country out of the present crisis. Willaddarage added that the politicians divided the people into parties and these parties hurled accusations at each other since independence. “The country did not benefit. We need a new political culture devoid of divisions”, he added. He said that the President managed the crisis in the country very well. In the last two years, we saw how the President dealt with the precipitous situation in the country as a leader and as an entrepreneur, not as a politician. “I am starting my political journey today with the experience I have gained from working as a businessman for almost 15 years”. He said that the people should decide whether the country is handed over to a leader who has a vision for the development of the country or a leader who lacks experience in steering the country in a crisis.",
