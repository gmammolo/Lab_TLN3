  "text": "City of Greater Bendigo Mayor Cr Andrea Metcalf and Chief Executive Officer Andrew Cooney are leading the tributes to Cr Rod Fyffe OAM, who passed away on Friday July 12 at the age of 75. Together they issue this joint statement: Today we acknowledge the amazing contribution of the remarkable Rod Fyffe OAM. For 38 years, Rod was a dedicated and beloved councillor. A truly kind man who took great pride in serving his community. To pass away still a councillor, would have meant a great deal to Rod. He served until the very end - it was the role of a lifetime. He was Mayor four times, Deputy Mayor twice and he worked with 12 Mayors, 12 CEOs and was a Councillor through the introduction of three Local Government Acts. He was our elder statesman and steady hand. Through the highs and lows of community life, Rod was there. When he celebrated 35 years as a Councillor, he reflected on the privilege of being able to steer the ship and contribute to a range of important decisions. His passions were preserving the environment, caring for our heritage buildings, the arts, particularly Bendigo Art Gallery, and in the community he was a passionate supporter of Golden Square Football Club. He would have been a familiar sight to many residents walking around the city centre talking to his constituents, greeting everyone with his friendly phrase \"Hello Worker\". You can only admire and be grateful for someone such as Rod, who gave so much of himself. We extend our deepest sympathies to Rod's wife Victoria, their sons Paul and Frank, and grandchildren Sophie, Lachy and Rowan. Rod, on behalf of Council, staff and the community, a sincere and heartfelt thank you for your service. [here](/city-honours-elder-statesman-cr-rod-fyffe-oam-1274359/).",
