  "text": "Vietnam, Cambodia destined to bring relations into new stage of development Friday, 10:04, 12/07/2024 VOV.VN - Vietnamese President To Lam is paying a state visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia from July 12 to July 13 at the invitation of Cambodian King Preah Bat Samdech Preah Boromneath Norodom Sihamoni.\nVietnamese President To Lam The visit is within the framework of President To Lam's first oversea business trip in his new position to affirm Vietnam's consistent policy of always valuing and desiring to further consolidate and deepen relations with Cambodia.\nSince Vietnam and Cambodia’s official establishment of diplomatic relations in 1967, the achievements of their relations have not only been the victory of the national liberation struggle in each country but also shown in the development of the cooperative ties in all aspects, thereby making a positive contribution to the development of each country, and further solidifying the both nations’ bonds.\nIn particular, in 2005, the two countries' senior leaders agreed to set out a new motto in developing bilateral relations: \"good neighbors, traditional friendship, comprehensive cooperation, and long-term sustainability\".\nWith that orientation, the relationship between the two countries has been continuously strengthened and developed across multiple fields, bringing practical benefits to their people, actively contributing to peace, stability and cooperation in the region and in the world.\nNotably, political relations play a core role, orienting the overall relationship between the two countries. The two sides have signed many documents as a basis for developing comprehensive cooperation, regularly conducting exchange visits, meetings and contacts between senior leaders at all levels through flexible forms even in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic.\nThrough the visits, the two sides consented to reaffirm the principles guiding the relationship between the two countries, agree on directions to consolidate and develop friendly relations and multi-faceted cooperation, form a specific mechanism, and step by step negotiate to resolve outstanding issues in order to create favorable conditions for the two countries to bring their ties to a new stage of development.\nActivities of the fronts, friendship parliamentary groups, friendship associations, and mass organizations of the two countries, especially in border provinces, have been launched widely as a contribution to improving understanding between their people, especially young generation, about tradition, solidarity, friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance between the two countries and two peoples.\nCooperation in defence and security has constantly been strengthened, becoming more and more substantive and effective, and is one of the important pillars in the relationship between the two countries. Both sides have always affirmed that they will not allow any hostile force to use their territory to harm the other country's security.\nIn his speech at the 47th Anniversary of Samdech Tocho Hun Sen's path to overthrow the genocidal regime of Pol Pot (June 20, 2024), Prime Minister Hun Manet affirmed that generations of Cambodian leaders remember Vietnam's sacrifice to help his nation escape the Pol Pot genocide, and the younger generation needs to preserve solidarity and friendly neighborliness between the two countries.\nEconomic, trade and investment cooperation is a bright spot, with bilateral trade turnover growing at a high level. The first four months of 2024 saw two-way trade turnover reach about US$3.9 billion, up 16.8% on-year.\nVietnam is currently Cambodia's third largest trading partner after China and the US and Cambodia's largest trading partner in ASEAN.\nTo date, Vietnam has run 205 valid investment projects in Cambodia with a total registered capital of US$2.94 billion, ranking first in ASEAN and in the top 5 countries with the largest direct investment in Cambodia, and ranked second among 79 countries and territories with investments in Vietnam.\nBoth nations have also paid attention to promoting other areas of cooperation in education - training, traffic - transportation, culture, health, telecommunications\nEvery year, Vietnam grants hundreds of long-term scholarships to Cambodian students to study in Vietnam, and the number of Vietnamese students studying in Cambodia is increasing.\nThe two countries also regularly launch cultural exchange activities, especially in border localities, coordinate and support each other at multilateral forums, especially at the United Nations, ASEAN and sub-regional mechanisms.\nReality has proven that despite experiencing many ups and downs the relationship between the two Parties and the two States is always closely linked and expressed in many different forms, depending on each context and situation and each specific historical moment.\nStrengthening solidarity, attachment, and mutual assistance between the two Parties and the two States is an objective necessity, a vital rule and the most important factor for each country's revolution, contributing to ensuring an environment of peace, security and development in the region.\nPresident To Lam's visit to Cambodia aims to strengthen and carry out high-level agreements, especially the results of the annual meetings between the Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) and the Central Committee of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP).\nThis will help to consolidate the strategic trust between the CPV and CPP and boost friendly relations and comprehensive cooperation with Cambodia, while continuing to bring relations between Vietnam and Cambodia into a new stage of development.\nVOV",
