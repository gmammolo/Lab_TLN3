  "text": "Caption: The streets of Paris were packed with people on Sunday during the second round of voting. Article information\nAuthor, Editorial Role, BBC News World 7 julio 2024\nThe results of the parliamentary elections in France brought joy to thousands of people who had taken to the streets to wait for their compatriots to finish casting their votes.\nFollowing the historic advance of the far-right National Rally party during the first round, analysts were pointing out that this party led by Marine Le Pen was on the verge of governing.\nBut the strategy of several centrist and left-wing candidates to drop out of the race in order to consolidate the vote turned the results around, and the left-wing alliance New Popular Front led the vote.\nCelebrations – and long faces – in the face of the result were the main features of the day.\nPhoto caption: The Place de la République in Paris was the place chosen by thousands of people to celebrate this Sunday.\nImage source, EPA\nCaption: Many people gathered to watch the election results together, given the importance of the vote for France.\nImage source, Reuters\nPhoto caption: The celebrations were particularly massive in Paris, where citizens carried slogans with the French triptych “Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.”\nImage source, EPA\nPhoto caption: At the protests, signs could be read with phrases such as “the extreme right will not pass.”\nImage source, EPA\nCaption: Celebrations spread across different parts of the country: in Marseille, in the south of France, citizens declared “Marseille, proud and popular citizen”.\nImage source, EPA\nCaption: After celebrating the results of the first round, supporters of Le Pen and the National Rally party were shocked to see their victory crumble.\nImage source, EPA\nPhoto caption: The atmosphere was gloomy at the headquarters of the National Group. Photo caption: A group of people burst into jubilation when the first results were announced.\nClick here to read more stories from BBC News Mundo.\nAnd remember that you can receive notifications in our app. Download the latest version and activate them.",
