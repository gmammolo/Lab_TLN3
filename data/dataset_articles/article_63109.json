  "text": "By Molly Farrar ,\n4 hours ago Establishments would be able to host happy hour if prices don’t change during the discounted period, the discount is announced at least three days before, and it’s before 10 p.m.\nSenator Julian Cyr in 2020. Photo by Pat Greenhouse/Globe Staff The Massachusetts Senate adopted an amendment Thursday that could bring happy hour back to Baystaters for the first time in four decades.\nState Sen. Julian Cyr proposed the amendment to a wider $2.8 billion economic development bill . A similar amendment passed in 2022, and Cyr renewed efforts to legalize the discounted drink practice with a bill last year.\n“It’s really crucial that we consider the significant economic boost to the nearly 19,000 restaurants and cafes we have in this Commonwealth which feed, employ and foster a sense of community across the state,” Cyr told lawmakers Thursday.\nThe amendment allows establishments to sell alcohol at a discounted price if the prices don’t change during the discounted period, the discount is announced at least three days before the period, and it’s before 10 p.m.\nMassachusetts banned happy hour in 1984 to combat drunken driving. Since then, states like Kansas and Illinois have repealed similar bans and have not seen an increase in incidents relating to drunk driving, according to Cyr.\n“The public health data is showing this is going in the right direction, so this is something that could be a boost to get people back to our downtowns and our main streets,” Cyr said.\nThe amendment would allow cities and towns to choose their own regulations for happy hour, which could only be set in certain neighborhoods. Cyr, who represents communities on the Cape and Islands, said some dry towns would abstain, while coastal communities might want to take advantage during their seasonal economies.\nThe legislature continued to debate the bill and its amendments into late Thursday night, although The Boston Globe reported it was likely to pass. The bill would then head to Governor Maura Healey’s desk.\nBut, Cyr said happy hour wouldn’t just improve the economy. He said Massachusetts is due for some “fun.” Lawmakers are already working on adding hundreds of liquor licenses for neighborhoods like Roxbury, Dorchester, Mattapan, East Boston, Roslindale, West Roxbury, and Hyde Park, which have significantly fewer businesses with liquor licenses than neighborhoods like Back Bay or the Seaport.\n“I hear this is a hard place for creatives and entrepreneurs to create fun,” Cyr said. “There’s a lot of rules and requirements and regulations. The cost to get in is really high, and I think we’ve got a bit of work to do in our fun factor.”\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
