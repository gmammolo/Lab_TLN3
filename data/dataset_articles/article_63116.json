And if they would, I do not do that thing.\"\nHere's everything you need to know about attending \"The Reunion.\"\nWhen is \"The Reunion\"?\n\"The Reunion\" will be held from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday, July 13 and from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday, July 14 at the MACC.\nWhere do I park?\nSelf parking and valet parking is available for a fee at the Miami Airport Convention Center,\naccording to the MACC website.\nIs there a shuttle bus to the convention center?\nFree shuttle buses run from Miami Airport to the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel next to the Miami Airport Convention Center from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. Find more information about the shuttle bus pick-up areas\non the MACC website.\nWhat time do doors open?\nOnce doors open, expect fans to walk in like Stanley on Pretzel Day.
