She lauded Al-Azhar's consistent support for women's roles in leadership and equality. Furthermore, Maharani shared her gratitude for Al-Azhar's positions on critical issues like Gaza, praising its role as a beacon of moderation and a defender of Muslim concerns worldwide.The Grand Imam expressed joy at the strengthening ties between Egypt and Indonesia, announcing plans to increase scholarships for Indonesian students at Al-Azhar.
