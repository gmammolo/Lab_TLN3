'Achieving self-sufficiency in pulse production is a priority for the country,' Chouhan stated.During the meeting on Friday, the minister expressed satisfaction over the increase in the area of pulse cultivation during the ongoing Kharif sowing season this year. The minister noted that the area under pulse cultivation has risen by over fifty percent, particularly for Tur/Arhar. He reiterated that the central government is committed to 100 percent procurement of Urad, Arhar, and Masur in all states, urging for awareness to encourage more farmers to engage in pulse cultivation.'The Centre is committed to 100 percent procurement for Urad, Arhar, and Masur in all states,' said Chouhan. Officials briefed the minister on the monsoon's onset, groundwater situation, and availability of seeds and fertilizers. The minister emphasized ensuring the timely availability of fertilizers for both Kharif and Rabi crops.Chouhan advised the Department of Fertilizer to meet the demand for DAP fertilizers. The meeting was attended by officials from the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, the Ministry, the Indian Meteorological Department, the Central Water Commission, and the Department of Fertilizers.The government's strategy to enhance pulse production includes encouraging farmers to switch to pulse cultivation through pre-registration initiatives by NAFED and NCCF. These drives aim to prepare farmers for the Kharif sowing season. In Madhya Pradesh alone, 8,487 Urad farmers have registered through NCCF and NAFED.(Disclaimer: With inputs from agencies.)",
