  "text": "By STAN MILAM Capitol News Service ,\n3 hours ago\nLAKE GENEVA — As a delegate to next week’s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Bob Kordus of Lake Geneva wants to emphasize the need for the party to adhere to fiscal conservative principles.\n“I have spent my working career in banking and financial consulting,” Kordus said. “That experience tells me that there needs to be a conservative approach to government spending that will lead to a strong economy.”\nIn addition to his financial experience, Kordus has given decades of service to the Republican Party.\n“I have been involved in the party organization for 20-plus years including membership on the Walworth County party and First District boards,” he said. “I am the past treasurer of the First District GOP Party.”\nAs a delegate to the national convention, Kordus will vote on the party platform which was recently released.\n“I have read summaries and have briefly gone over the platform, and in general I agree with what I have seen,” he said. “I believe the platform aligns with my conservative views.”\nKordus said he will know more about the details of the platform after a meeting with party leaders.\n“I plan to meet with state party chair Brian Schimming prior to the convention,” he said. “I will have the opportunity to get more details on the platform and ask questions about some of my areas of concern.”\nKordus was a supporter of the Tea Party movement and has been a consistent supporter of Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson.\n“Sen. Johnson has been and remains a strong critic of deficit spending,” Kordus said. “I could not agree with him more.”\n“We have seen continuing deficit spending under the Biden administration and what it has led to in terms of the economy,” he said. “Biden has overturned several of President Trump’s executive orders that were working.”\nKordus said examples of those Trump executive orders include current issues of great concern.\n“Look at the current border problems,” he said. “Our borders are not secure. President Trump was working to secure our borders, but that was all undone by Biden.”\nKordus is also concerned about the nation’s trade policies. He questioned whether a free market can be achieved while so-called trading partners consistently violate trade agreements.”\nDemonstrations, including a parade, are planed during the convention. Kordus said he has no problem with those activities.\n“Everyone has a right to express their opinions the same as I do,” he said. “As long as the demonstrations and similar activities involve no violence, I see no problem with them. I hope that we all can be respectful of the views of others.”\nIn addition to party politics at its highest level, Kordus sees the convention as an opportunity to share with the rest of the nation Wisconsin and its largest city.\n“As a former resident of Milwaukee, I’m looking forward to being a part of an event that will showcase a great city and a great state,” he said. “Like many others, I’m proud to represent Wisconsin in this important event.”\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
