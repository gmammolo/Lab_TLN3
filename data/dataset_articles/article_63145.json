  "text": "- President Ferdinand ''Bongbong'' Marcos Jr. on Friday guaranteed Aurora residents that the national government is prepared for the possible effects of rainy season in the province.\nMarcos visited Aurora province to distribute presidential assistance to farmers, fisherfolks, and their families. The President disclosed that over P180 million worth of relief supplies are pre-positioned for Central Luzon.\n''At ngayon naman, na paparating na ang tag-ulan, nakahanda na rin po ang inyong pamahalaan sa anumang magiging epekto nito. Mayroon na tayong naka pre-position na relief supplies na nagkakahalaga ng higit isandaan [at] walumpung milyong piso para sa buong Region 3,'' Marcos said in his speech.\nOn May 29, state weather bureau PAGASA declared the start of the rainy season in the country. It also said that around two to three tropical cyclones are expected to enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility this month.\nMarcos also mentioned that the Aguang flood control project was already completed to ease the impact of floods in Aurora, a province that is often hit by typhoons.\n''Natapos na rin ang Aguang River Flood Control Structure Project sa Baler. Ito po ay makakatulong upang mapigilan ang matinding pagbaha at malaking pinsala na dulot ng pag-apaw ng Aguang River,'' Marcos said.\nDuring the event, the President turned over farm machinery to local farmers and fisherfolk, aimed at boosting agricultural efficiency in Aurora. He also gave P10,000 each to ten selected beneficiaries from the province.\nFurthermore, the provincial government of Aurora received P10 million to support local development projects aimed at enhancing the quality of life in the province, and provided five kilograms of rice to each attendee. —AOL, GMA Integrated News",
