  "text": "THE United Nations Human Rights Council has adopted the first-ever resolution aimed at promoting and protecting the human rights of seafarers.\nTabled by the Philippines, the resolution seeks to eliminate all forms of discrimination and unfair labor practices against seafarers, “ensuring a safe and secure workplace, fair terms of employment, decent working and living conditions on-board ships, health protection, medical care, welfare measures, and other forms of social protection.”\n“This milestone resolution by the Human Rights Council advances an advocacy of the Philippines, other foreign governments, relevant international organizations and stakeholders to protect and promote the well-being of some 1.9 million seafarers, over a quarter of them Filipinos,” Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo said.\nThe significance of this landmark resolution is underscored by the fact that Filipinos constitute the largest nationality of maritime crew, at least a quarter of the 1.9 million seafarers, serving the international merchant fleet.\n“The resolution acknowledges that seafarers brave challenging conditions at sea that pose risks to their enjoyment of human rights, safety, and well-being. Seafarers conduct their duties, even at times under dangerous conditions,” Manalo emphasized.\nMoreover, the resolution calls for stronger collaboration between “States, shipowners’ representatives, seafarers’ representatives, the International Labor Organization, the International Maritime Organization, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders to uphold and protect the rights and dignity of all seafarers worldwide.” It affirms that safe and decent living and working conditions at sea are imperative human rights.\nAs a nation with a considerable global diaspora in the seafaring industry, Manalo said “the Philippines intends to maintain its active engagement in the Council, the United Nations, and all relevant international bodies.”\nHe emphasized the Philippines’ commitment to “contribute meaningfully to global efforts to set the highest standards for promoting and protecting the dignity and rights of migrants worldwide.”\nEditor’s Note: This is an updated article.
