  "text": "ISLAMABAD: The interior ministry informed the Senate Committee on Interior that foolproof arrangements had been made for the security of the Chinese engineers and other staff working in Pakistan. Senator Faisal Saleem Rehman chaired the committee meeting here. Senator Irfan Siddiqui said many things of law and order were related to the provinces and a new wave of terrorism was rising every day. “Every day we are hearing the news of martyrdom of our soldiers. Whether any operation will take place or not,” he asked. Briefing the committee, Interior Minister Moshin Naqvi said the security of the Chinese engineers and other staff was being taken care of and foolproof security arrangements had been made. He said the current wave of terrorism was due to the agreements made by the previous government with the Taliban, which led to the release of terrorists from prisons. He said after their release, the terrorists started forming groups of 15 to 20 people for terrorist activities. He said there was misconception about the Azm-e-Istehkam in the media. He said maintaining law and order was the responsibility of the provinces and other institutions will go and return after doing targeted operations, but peace was the responsibility of the provinces. “FC conducts border security and targeted operations. The targeted operations and border security fall under the Ministry of Interior,” he said. Naqvi said the interior ministry will give a follow-up on the murder cases of journalists. He mentioned the ongoing operations in Punjab and Sindh with the support of Rangers, and significant improvements in the security on the main Super Highway. He told the committee that President Zardari visited Sukkur and held a meeting in which it the local police officers would be removed from the division. The standing committee asked the FC officials for a report on a terrorist attack on Senator Hidayatullah. He told the committee that coordination among the departments concerned had been organized in a better manner. Senator Umar Farooq said protection of the life of the common citizen should be the first priority of the government. On his request, the committee sought a report on the Balochistan coal mines from the Balochistan government. The committee chairman appreciated the recent actions of anti-smuggling agencies at Torkham border to prevent smuggling. Senator Irfan Siddiqui said the Chinese were not tourists and not just part-time visitors but they were playing a very important role in Pakistan’s economy, national security, development and prosperity. “We have to fulfill our responsibilities to ensure the safety of the Chinese,” he said. Senator Naseema Ehsan informed the committee about threats to her and her family’s lives and said there was an attack on her house after which her children could not go anywhere. She further told the committee that she had contacted the IG Police but he said he was busy attending a meeting. In the committee meeting, Senator Saifullah Abro said the senators had started talking about their own security and asked what they had to do about the others’ security.
