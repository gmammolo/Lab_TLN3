  "text": "DES MOINES, Iowa (Gray Television Iowa Capitol Bureau) - Thursday Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds announced new state programs to help homeowners impacted by recent severe weather. These programs are for people who live in a federally declared disaster county.\nReynolds says housing is the biggest struggle communities are facing both in northwest Iowa from flooding and in Minden and Greenfield which were hit by tornadoes.\n“I talked to one mom who said you know here’s where my daughter and my grandkids live. My mom is across the street. We’ve been here our entire lives. So generations of Iowans want to stay there and we need to help make that happen,” Reynolds said.\nOn July 15, the state will launch the State Disaster Recovery New Housing Grant. “The program will award experienced developers up to $1 million per project to build housing units in federally disaster declared communities. Again, that qualify for FEMA’s individual assistance program,” Reynolds said.\nThe program caps the cost of single family homes at just under $300,000 as well as townhomes and duplexes at less than $250k.\nFor homes that need some repairs, the state is setting aside money to help individual homeowners too. “The program provides eligible homeowners with up to $50,000 for disaster affected homes suitable for repair,” Reynolds said.\nThe Disaster Recovery Housing Assistance, or REHAB, grants have a maximum of $50,000 per homeowner to make repairs.\nReynolds says farmers are in a rough spot as well. That’s because interest rates on USDA loans are higher than what they can get locally, and don’t have the same benefits as Small Business Administration loans which farmers can’t get. Now, farmers can apply to be a part of a new program now online at IowaGrants.Gov .\n“This program actually buys down interest rates by reimbursing interest payments up to $50,000 per household over 12 months on commercial loans farmers will use to repair damage,” Reynolds said.\nReynolds says it’s been difficult to get Iowans to take assistance that’s being offered, but encourages folks to do so. “Iowans tend to be just, you know, I don’t need it. Somebody else needs it worse than I do. I am going to be able to be fine. They need it. So, please just take advantage of these programs. You’re dealing with a lot. They’re there for a reason,” Reynolds said.\nFor federal assistance, you can get more information at DisasterAssistance.Gov . For state aid, you can head to DisasterRecovery.Iowa.Gov .\nThe race is on to find solutions so that students have a place to go in a few short weeks. Iowa Department of Education Director McKenzie Snow says the schools in Rock Valley and Spencer in particular have extensive damage.\nRight now, schools are still taking inventory of what is salvageable and what is still needed. Snow says the schools have lost curriculum and instruction items, electronics, school busses, and playgrounds. While the buildings are in need of repair, Snow says the state is calling on other districts to help provide mobile classrooms.\n”We are in the process of securing temporary learning spaces as needed, so that students can return to school as quickly as possible while their buildings may still be under repair,” Snow said.\nSnow says they’re working on identifying what transportation needs the district has and how they can fill the gaps now that some students are homeless or displaced.\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds says the Department of Education is working to secure curriculum materials for the district and hopes schools will be able to start on time.\n--\nConner Hendricks covers state government and politics for Gray Television-owned stations in Iowa.
