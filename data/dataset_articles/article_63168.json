  "text": "NATO allies putting in place foundations for Ukraine to prevail - Stoltenberg NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said this during the closing press conference at the end of the NATO Summit in Washington on Thursday, according to an Ukrinform correspondent. \"Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, NATO Allies have provided Ukraine with unprecedented support, including tens of billions of euros in military aid. Ukraine has had a difficult winter and spring. Gaps and delays in the provision of military support have had real consequences on the battlefield. And Ukrainians have shown remarkable courage and tenacity in holding the line. But we cannot and will not allow this to happen again. At this summit, we are turning the corner and putting in place the foundations for Ukraine to prevail,\" he said. Stoltenberg noted that on Thursday, July 11, as part of the NATO-Ukraine Council, Allies had a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky who opted them on the situation on the battlefield and Ukraine's most urgent needs. Stoltenberg recalled that during the summit, Allies have agreed to launch the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU), with a command in Germany, logistics hubs in the alliance and around 700 personnel. [Pentagon: New aid package for Ukraine includes Patriot battery, munitions for HIMARS](/rubric-ato/3884467-pentagon-new-aid-package-for-ukraine-includes-patriot-battery-munitions-for-himars.html) NATO will also coordinate the training of Ukrainian forces at facilities in Allied countries, plan and coordinate the provision of donations, manage the transfer and repair of equipment and provide support to the long-term development of Ukraine's Armed Forces. \"Allies have also agreed a major financial pledge to Ukraine, with a minimum baseline of EUR 40 billion within the next year. And to sustain our support for Ukraine to prevail. We will review this level at forthcoming Summits to ensure that our support continues to meet Ukraine's needs,\" Stoltenberg said. He noted that the Europeans are more than matching the overall U.S. support for Ukraine. \"This pledge will ensure greater burden sharing of military support too. It will also provide Ukraine the reliable support it needs to deter and defend against future Russian aggression now and in the future,\" Stoltenberg said. In addition, he said, at the Summit Allies have made further announcements of immediate military aid including critical air defense, and more Allies have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine bringing the total to more than 20. Allies have taken further steps to deepen Ukraine's interoperability with NATO, bolster Ukraine's defense industry and enhance cooperation on innovation, he added. Allies also agreed to establish NATO-Ukraine Joint Analysis Training and Education Center in Poland. All of this support will make Ukraine stronger and more capable. \"In fact, everything we are doing - the command, the pledge, more military aid, more security agreements, and improved interoperability put in place the foundations for Ukraine to prevail. They serve as a bridge to NATO. Allies have agreed that as Ukraine continues necessary reforms, we will support them on the irreversible path to membership,\" Stoltenberg said. He noted that today Allies sent a strong message of unity and resolve to Moscow that \"violence and intimidation do not pay, and that Ukraine can count on NATO now and for the long haul.\"",
