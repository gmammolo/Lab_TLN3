  "text": "Control of the House of Representatives is within grasp for Democrats in November.\nAll 435 House seats will be up for grabs in 2024, and both Democrats and Republicans are feeling optimistic about their chances to control the lower chamber.\nControl of the House of Representatives is within grasp for Democrats in November.\nAll 435 House seats will be up for grabs in 2024, and both Democrats and Republicans are feeling optimistic about their chances to control the lower chamber.\nA host of competitive races are expected to be critical in determining which party will lead the House.\nRepublicans are hoping to expand their thin majority, which has declined as lawmakers have retired or stepped down. On the other hand, Democrats are hoping to capitalize and flip a few districts to take the House next year.\n“As Democrats and Republicans fight for control of the House, all eyes have been on the 17 Republicans representing districts President Joe Biden picked up in the 2020 presidential election. The path to reclaim the House — as Democrats see it — is through those GOP-held seats,” reports USA Today.\nOn the other hand, Republicans are targeting the few Democrats representing districts former President Donald Trump won in 2020.\nIf Democrats flip control of the House, Rep. Hakim Jeffries would be poised to become the first Black speaker in the nation’s history.\nWinning back the House becomes even more critically important considering the tight presidential race and the likelihood of Democrats losing their Senate majority. Current polls show President Joe Biden trailing former President Donald Trump.\nIn the Senate, Democrats are also facing an uphill battle.\nAs USA Today reports:\n“There are 33 United States senators up for reelection in 2024. Ten are Republicans, three are Independents, and 20 are Democrats.\n“The upper chamber, which is now controlled narrowly by Democrats, could flip red if the GOP performs well in November. The map is considered to favor Republicans slightly this election cycle, though electoral predictions will continue to evolve, and surprises on the campaign trail are always possible.”\nPolitical observers say Democrats have a good chance of winning back the House majority. Democrats need to clinch four seats to do so.\nDemocrats seeking to flip the House have to continue talking about the issues that voters care about and they must remind voters that if former President Donald Trump wins, a Democratic-led House will be needed to serve as a bulwark against a corrupt and convicted felon.\nThey must remind voters that if President Joe Biden wins, he will need a Democrat-led House to pass more legislation to protect the rights of all Americans.\nControl of the House is a reason for Americans to vote in November.\nThis editorial is part of an occasional series on why Americans should vote in November.\nKeep it Clean.
