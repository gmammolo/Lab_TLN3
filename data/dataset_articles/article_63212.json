  "text": "Politics of Thursday, 11 July 2024 Source: starrfm.com.gh Renowned Dubai-based Ghanaian mogul Kingsley Kojo Aikins has significantly influenced young African entrepreneurs in the Diaspora. His remarkable journey from a warehouse helper to the founder and CEO of three flourishing enterprises—Eyes In Dubai, Dream Seekers Travels, and Nene Glam Beauty—serves as an inspiring story of resilience and ambition. In 2019, Kingsley Kojo Aikins left Ghana for Dubai, a city synonymous with luxury and unyielding ambition. Starting as a warehouse helper with a salary of AED 1,100 (equivalent to GHS 1,980), he approached his job with dedication, viewing each day as an opportunity to learn. Through hard work, he gained valuable skills in customer service and business operations. Driven by an insatiable thirst for success and a vision for the future, Aikins decided to venture into entrepreneurship. With limited resources but boundless determination, he founded Eyes In Dubai, a travel agency that offered personalized, luxurious journeys. His innovative approach quickly distinguished Eyes In Dubai from the competition. Eyes In Dubai became synonymous with bespoke travel services, from desert safaris to exclusive yacht cruises. Aikins' leadership and vision were instrumental in establishing the agency as a leader in the travel industry. He leveraged his savings, sought investment, and meticulously planned every aspect of his venture, navigating bureaucratic hurdles and building a client base from the ground up. Through resilience and innovation, Eyes In Dubai began to flourish. The agency's reputation for excellence spread through word-of-mouth and positive reviews. Aikins expanded the team, introduced advanced booking technologies, and continuously adapted to evolving travel industry trends. Not content with just one successful venture, Aikins launched Dream Seekers Travels, catering to a broader audience with unique travel experiences. Whether it was adventure travel, cultural tours, or romantic getaways, Dream Seekers Travels has quickly become a favorite among travelers seeking memorable experiences. Recognizing a gap in the beauty market, Aikins founded Nene Glam Beauty. The brand quickly gained traction for its high-quality products and innovative approach. From skincare to cosmetics, Nene Glam Beauty is gradually becoming a trusted name, catering to the needs of a diverse clientele. As part of growing his business acumen, Aikins is set to add two new companies; an investment company and a delivery service, he continues to lead his enterprises to new heights. He is focused on innovation, quality, and customer satisfaction. “The future looks bright for Eyes In Dubai, Dream Seekers Travels, and Nene Glam Beauty, as we will continue to set new standards”. Beyond his business accomplishments, Aikins is also known for his philanthropic efforts, he visits the orphanage homes yearly . He is a strong advocate for empowering young entrepreneurs, providing mentorship and support to those following in his footsteps. His plans include expanding his brands globally, continuing to offer unparalleled travel experiences, and further cementing his legacy as a visionary leader in both industries.",
