  "text": "Elon Musk and Trump have met multiple times. If Trump were to return to the White House, it could prove beneficial to Tesla, Wedbush analysts wrote in a note to investors. Marc Piasecki/Joe Raedle/Getty Images Wedbush analysts note a Trump presidency may hurt the EV sector but benefit Tesla. Higher Chinese tariffs could limit competition, giving Tesla an edge in the US EV Market. Overall, Wedbush writes that Trump&#039;s presidency would be an overall negative for the industry. As Tesla&#039;s stock surges and the EV giant gears up for its (reportedly delayed) robotaxi unveiling, questions are swirling about how the impending US presidential election will impact Elon Musk&#039;s car company. According to a note to investors from Wedbush analysts, Trump&#039;s possible return to the White House could be a good thing for Tesla. &quot;Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Elon Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment,&quot; Wedbush analysts wrote in the note. Additionally, the Wedbush analysts wrote that a likely increase in tariffs on Chinese goods would &quot;continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio, etc.) from flooding the US market over the coming years.&quot; Chinese tariffs have remained a large talking point in Trump&#039;s campaign. The Republican candidate has discussed implementing a 60% tariff on Chinese imports, largely exceeding his former tariff policy on China during his presidency. Some of Tesla&#039;s biggest competitors include BYD and Nio, which are currently not available in the US. But Musk has previously said China is &quot;by far&quot; Tesla&#039;s biggest competitor. He said a lot of people think the top 10 car companies will be Tesla, followed by nine Chinese car brands, and &quot;they might not be wrong.&quot; Most recently, Tesla&#039;s biggest competitor BYD just made a deal to build a $1 billion factory in Turkey, which could provide the automaker with a way around EU tariffs and make it a larger threat in the global EV market. Even though a Trump presidency could benefit Tesla, Wedbush analysts said in the note it &quot;would be an overall negative for the EV industry&quot; because the EV tax incentives would likely be removed. EV tax incentives allow buyers to save up to $7,500 when they purchase a new EV, although there&#039;s some caveats to the tax break, like a limited number of eligible vehicles. Musk hasn&#039;t announced who he&#039;s voting for in the 2024 Presidential election, but has said it&#039;s unlikely he&#039;ll vote for Biden. Musk has met with the former President on multiple occasions and said at Tesla&#039;s annual meeting that Trump calls him &quot;out of the blue for no reason.&quot; He also mentioned in the meeting that Trump&#039;s &quot;a huge fan of the Cybertruck&quot; and his friends that have Teslas &quot;love it.&quot; If you enjoyed this story, be sure to follow Business Insider on Microsoft Start.",
