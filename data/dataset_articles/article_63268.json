  "text": "Iwen Chu is the first Asian American to serve Brooklyn in the New York State Legislature. Iwen came to New York with 2 pieces of luggage and the drive to pursue her American Dream. While studying for her Master of Sociology from CUNY Brooklyn College, she fell in love with New Yorks diverse, vibrant cultures and all our city has to offer. Born and raised in Taiwan, she dedicated herself to the communities of southern Brooklyn and planted roots with her husband and daughter in Dyker Heights. Iwen has brought that dedication to the State Senate. In just her first term, Iwen has delivered for Southern Brooklyn. She secured a record $30 million in funding for AAPI communities in partnership with the AAPI Equity Budget Coalition, backed the effort to fully fund public schools, helped resolve constituent cases to strengthen the quality of life issues and cut through bureaucracy. More importantly, Iwen recognizes the significance of ensuring public safety for our families, and shes fighting for increased resources in Albany to address this critical issue. Iwen has championed legislation on education, adult literacy, housing, environmental, and gender equality issues. She remains committed to being a strong voice on behalf of our Southern Brooklyn families. This dedication to Southern Brooklyn is nothing new for Iwen. As a public school parent, a community journalist, and a public servant, Iwen has seen the myriad of challenges that working families face every day. Before she held office, she worked in the New York State Assembly to bridge the gap between the immigrant community and the State government. Senator Chu ensured that the needs of her district were heard loud and clear in Albany and will continue to fight for and represent the families and residents of Sunset Park, Bensonhurst, Bath Beach, Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights and Kensington in the New York State Senate. https://iwenchu.com/",
