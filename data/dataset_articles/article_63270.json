  "text": "Entertainment The biggest pan-India film ever made is releasing in 38 languages, and has greenlit a sequel even before the first part has released The trend of pan-India films is here to stay. The success of Kalki 2898 AD in the Hindi belt has ensured that. And the year 2024 will see several more of these mega industry crossovers releasing in theatres. One of them has even greenlit a sequel, much before it even releases in theatres. This step has not increased audience’s curiosity for it but has also got industry insiders wondering about the makers’ confidence in their product. Biggest pan-India film getting a sequel Suriya’s ambitious period drama Kanguva is being pegged as the biggest pan-India film this year. While both Pushpa 2 and Kalki 2898 AD have higher budgets than Kanguva, the Suriya-starrer has certain aces up its sleeve – the biggest of which is its ambitious release in 38 languages across the world. On Thursday, the film’s makers – officially announced Kanguva 2, the film’s sequel. In a recent interview, producer KE Gnanvel Raja revealed that the story is going to be told in two parts. The producer shared that the film will end with an exciting twist leaving everyone excited for the sequel. He stated that the film's sequel shooting will start by the end of 2025 and Kanguva Part 2 is expected to hit the big screens in the first half of 2027 - either in January or the summer holidays. [Kanguva ](https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-biggest-pan-india-film-kanguva-38-languages-shot-in-7-countries-suriya-bobby-deol-pushpa-2-kalki-2898-ad-3087483)presents the story of two eras, historic and present, and keeping this in mind, the makers have filmed it in several real-life locations and across the globe. To keep the uniqueness and theme of the film, the makers have shot it in exotic locations in Goa, Europe, and a major schedule, including war sequences, was shot in Sri Lanka for 60 days.
