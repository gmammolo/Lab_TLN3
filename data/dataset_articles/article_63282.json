  "text": "- Wahome thanked Ruto for the opportunity to serve in his first Cabinet, under two different ministries. - On Thursday, President Ruto dissolved the entire Cabinet, sending home all Cabinet Secretaries and Attorney General. Former Lands Cabinet Secretary Alice Wahome has said that President William can count on her continued support. This is after Ruto dismissed his entire Cabinet, save for Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi. Wahome thanked Ruto for the opportunity to serve in his first Cabinet, under two different ministries. \"This is to convey my sincere gratitude to H.E Dr William Samoei Ruto for the opportunity and privilege you granted to me to serve as the Cabinet Secretary Lands, Public Works, Housing and Urban Development and previously as a Cabinet Secretary Water, Sanitation and Irrigation,\" her statement reads in part. Wahome went on to say that during the 21 months she has been in Cabinet, the President supported her fully in doing her job. She added she will always support the Head of State to build a stronger country. \"During my period of service, you gave me support in the execution of my duties and I will forever remain grateful,\" the former CS said. \"You can count on my continued support, especially during this time when our Nation requires all hands and energies pulling together to build a stronger and resilient Kenya.\" On Thursday, President Ruto dissolved the entire Cabinet, sending home all Cabinet Secretaries and Attorney General. The President said the affairs of the Ministries will henceforth be coordinated by Principal Secretaries until a definitive cabinet is appointed. \"I have decided to dismiss with immediate effect all cabinet secretaries and attorney general of the Cabinet of Kenya except the Prime Cabinet Secretary and Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs,\" Ruto said. \"And of course, the office of the Deputy President is not affected in any way.\" The Head of State said the new cabinet will be named after extensive consultations across all sectors.",
