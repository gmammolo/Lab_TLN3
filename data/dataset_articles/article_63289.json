  "text": "As we gathered to celebrate the Fourth of July, we reflected on the remarkable journey that has shaped the United States into the beacon of freedom and justice it is today. Our nation’s Founding Fathers, many of whom were young men in their 20s, possessed a wisdom and vision that transcended their years. They laid the groundwork for a nation founded on God-fearing principles, justice, and liberty for all. The Declaration of Independence, signed in 1776, was more than just a document; it was a bold proclamation of a new era in which the inherent rights of individuals were recognized and protected. These brave men, aware of the monumental task before them, crafted a system of governance that was revolutionary. They established a framework of checks and balances designed to prevent tyranny and ensure justice for all. This system has been a guiding light for nearly two and a half centuries, a testament to their foresight and their understanding of human nature. Our founders envisioned a nation that would be a sanctuary for the oppressed and a defender of the weak. They created a government that was accountable to its people, and that derived its powers from the consent of the governed. The United States was to be a place where individuals could pursue their dreams without fear of oppression, where the rule of law would prevail, and where liberty and justice were more than mere ideals — they were a way of life. Today, however, we face a grave challenge to these founding principles. There is a political faction that has strayed from the path laid out by our forefathers, weaponizing our justice system and compromising the integrity of our institutions. This , departure from foundational values threatens the very fabric of our society, undermining the principles of fairness and accountability that have long been the hallmark of our great nation. he U.S. has always been a beacon of light, a protector against evil and a defender of the weak. From the shores of Normandy to the mountains of Afghanistan, American soldiers have fought and died to preserve the freedoms we hold dear. Our country has been a refuge for those fleeing tyranny, a land where the oppressed can find sanctuary and hope. Yet today our government appears to be turning its back on these principles, aligning itself more closely with European and global economic agendas rather than upholding the unique values that set us apart. The story of my own family reflects the quintessential American dream. My mother and grandmother emigrated from Italy with the hope of building a better life in a land of opportunity. They learned the language, embraced American culture, and worked tirelessly to achieve their dreams. This spirit of determination and aspiration is what makes America exceptional. Our current immigration system is in disarray, however. While professionals from around the world who follow legal channels face rejection and bureaucratic hurdles, our borders remain vulnerable to illegal immigration. This chaos not only threatens our sovereignty, but also undermines the rule of law that our country is built on. We must restore order to our immigration system, ensuring that those who seek to contribute to our society through legal means are given the opportunity to do so. As we look toward the future, the election in November stands as a critical juncture for our nation. It is a make-or-break moment, a last stand to defend the principles that have made America a beacon of hope and freedom. We must choose leaders who will uphold the values enshrined in our Constitution, who will protect our justice system from political weaponization, and who will restore integrity to our immigration policies. The stakes have never been higher. Independence Day celebrations my be behind us, but let us remember the sacrifices of those who came before us, and let us commit ourselves to preserving the legacy of liberty, justice and freedom for generations to come.
