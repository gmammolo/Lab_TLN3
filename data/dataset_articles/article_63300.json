Photo: Getty Images US President Joe Biden has reaffirmed his commitment to continuing the United States' policy of global leadership in supporting Ukraine and strengthening NATO, emphasising that it is a matter of national security for the US.\nSource: Biden at a final press conference after the NATO summit in Washington on Thursday; Ukrainform\nQuote: \"I will not walk away from Ukraine. I will keep NATO strong. That's exactly what we did, and exactly what we'll continue to do now.\"\nAdvertisement: Details: Biden emphasised that the future of US policy depends on the American people, who will make their choice in November.\nHowever, Biden warned that this is much more than a political issue, \"it is a national security issue\".\nHe added that it is not about his political campaign but about the coming decades.\nAdvertisement: In this context, he recalled how his predecessor Donald Trump refused to commit to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which is considered the cornerstone of collective security. In addition, Biden recalled that Trump called the Russian dictator Putin a \"genius\".\nBackground:\nOn 11 July, 23 states and the EU signed a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine.
