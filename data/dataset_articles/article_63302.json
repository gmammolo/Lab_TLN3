  "text": "- The Nadco report contains solutions to issues that Kenyans, including Gen Zs, have raised, the governor said\n- The bipartisan team took views from Kenyans on the reforms they wanted implemented and compiled the Nadco report\nMajority of Homa Bay residents support ODM leader Raila Odinga's remarks on the National Dialogue Committee report, Governor Gladys Wanga has said.\nThe Nadco report contains solutions to issues that Kenyans, including Gen Zs, have raised, the governor said.\nThe Committee was formed after Azimio supporters engaged in street protests last year, to demand the cost of living be lowered.\nOther issues that were outlined are high taxation, rampant corruption and joblessness among the youth.\nAs the protests between March and July 2023 got bloody, President William Ruto and Raila agreed to dialogue, leading to the establishment of the Committee.\nThe bipartisan team took views from Kenyans on the reforms they wanted implemented and compiled the Nadco report.\nHowever, the recommendations are yet to be effected.\nOn Tuesday, Raila said the report contained many of the issues raised by the youth and implementing it fully would resolve these.\nHe called on Kenyans to give national dialogue a chance, saying this would enable them to come up with solutions.\nBut his remarks did not go down well with Gen Zs, who criticised him for supporting dialogue while they called for action.\nIt was in this regard that Wanga claimed residents supported Raila's stand.\n“I have no doubt that many Homa Bay people support Raila and the plan to have a national conversation. We’re sure that full implementation of the report will ensure Kenyans get the reforms they wanted,” the governor said.\nShe spoke during the launch of the Genowa Ondoa Kaunda classrooms initiative at Ndonyo primary in Karachuonyo constituency.\nThe initiative seeks to eradicate mabati structures in Early Year Education schools.\nWanga asked the youth to give dialogue a chance as proposed by the ODM leader, saying he understands the needs of youth and other citizens.\n“Raila has the best interest of Kenyans at heart,” she said.\nThe governor applauded Raila and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka for attending the signing of the electoral agency amendment bill by the President at KICC.\n“We must understand that Kenya is at a crossroads and dialogue is what can help us get solution to our problems. And that is why the signing of the IEBC Amendment Bill was a big stride the country made last Tuesday,” Wanga said.\nThe new law paves the way for the appointment of new IEBC commissioners, which is one of the contentions raised by Gen Z protestors.",
