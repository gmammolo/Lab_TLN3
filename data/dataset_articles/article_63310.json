  "text": "A lot of politicians are currenty trying to work out what to do next, and their options range from whatever they were trained for to featuring in a fly-on-the-wall docuseries. That last one’s Jacob Rees-Mogg , by the way.\nWe doubt that any of them have plans to become an amateur detective, since many of the ones that lost their seats were apparently unable to identify a party by the presence of alcohol, party food and dancing, but that’s the premise of the German made-for-TV film Miss Merkel – Ein Uckermark-Krimi .\nIt came to the attention of Twitter/X after @ilvit02 shared this ad for the Italian-dubbed version.\nCosa succederebbe se #AngelaMerkel diventasse un’investigatrice? #MissMerkel è la nuova curiosa serie di #Rai2 dove l’ex cancelliera tedesca, in pensione, si diletta a risolvere alcuni casi di omicido\nIn onda da venerdì, in prima serata! #Series #Rai #Palinsesti #AscoltiTv pic.twitter.com/GqgOa6k3Sn\n— Vittorio (@ilvit02) July 9, 2024\nAuthor John Bleasdale shared it for the English-speaking crowd, albeit with a slight misunderstanding.\nItaly now has a TV show called Miss Merkel which imagines Angela Merkel as a private investigator solving murders in North Italy. https://t.co/lttL5H6joS\n— John Bleasdale (@drjonty) July 9, 2024\nIt’s actually two separate German made-for-television films, both set in the Uckermark region of Germany and featuring Katharina Thalbach as the Chancellor-turned-sleuth.\nThe concept was an instant hit. Here’s how people reacted.\n1. Not Mrs Marple. But Mrs Merkel – an Italian detective series built round the idea that the German premier has retired to become a private detective. I hope this ends up on Netflix so I can watch it. https://t.co/ewxfm9cvfS\n— Back in Time West London (@OldLondonW14) July 9, 2024\n2. What about one in which Liz Truss tries to solves murders but inevitably fails and, in fact, causes more murders? https://t.co/GcXQQVkZEn\n—  Dr. Waitman W. Beorn (@waitmanwbeorn.com ) (@waitmanb) July 10, 2024\n3. That's nuts but marvellous!\n— Saskia Daniel (@hasenschneck) July 9, 2024\n4. OMG this looks fantastic! Must find!!\n— Gaylord Felcher (@drunkAFgay) July 10, 2024\n5. The more I think about this the closer I get to hysterical giggles. She'd have had to have ok'd this, right? It would be so funny to have her do a cameo in this too just omg https://t.co/SpP7HoEXKO\n— Magnificent Ewa of Judgement (@EwaSR) July 10, 2024\n6. need a crossover with don matteo (where a priest on a bike solves the many murders happening weekly in a small town, proving how incompetent the police are) https://t.co/vH205AqIho\n— sara (@ssaraproblem) July 10, 2024\n7. You spend years working on a script only for someone to beat you to the punch. https://t.co/D8ryLsbvtp\n— Ciaran Cassidy (@CiaranCass) July 9, 2024\n8. And yet my script for Jacinta Arden catching crims in Portrush goes uncommissioned @BBCnireland @bbcwritersroom https://t.co/xT0Vspnxws\n— Mary Flanigan (@ourladyofFlan) July 10, 2024\n9. I DEMAND a British version. https://t.co/DJDE61GU4E\n— Alex Andreou (@sturdyAlex) July 9, 2024\n10. The gritty UK remake. https://t.co/v52RgRsbBW pic.twitter.com/GuEsevp2xu\n— Ross Lawson (@Ross_Lawson) July 10, 2024\n11. Still a better story then Prometheus pic.twitter.com/Sbpt9Xowub\n— MOVIEDEATHS (@MOVIEDEATHBLOWS) July 10, 2024\nIf they ever bring it to UK TV, there’s an obvious rename lined up.\nMerkel, She Wrote.\n— Colin the Dachshund (@DachshundColin) July 9, 2024\nFinally, if you know, you know. Where were you when I needed you Angela?! https://t.co/WCrCfxvJ1h\n— Amanda Knox (@amandaknox) July 10, 2024\nREAD MORE ‘Hot Detectives In Your Area’ hilariously drags Holmes and Watson into the 21st century\nSource @ilvit02 Image Screengrab",
