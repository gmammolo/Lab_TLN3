  "text": "A trip to Washington, D.C., this week didn’t yield immediate results, but Decatur Mayor Tab Bowling said he returned with optimism about getting money for the second phase of a study for a new Tennessee River bridge. Bowling, City Councilman Carlton McMasters and city Chief Financial Officer Kyle Demeester met Monday with U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, Rep. Dale Strong, R-Huntsville, and their staffs. U.S. Sen. Katie Britt was absent, but her chief of staff, Clay Armentrout, and her legislative director, Dan Hillenbrand, did attend. It was a quick, 24-hour trip for the trio. Demeester said funds for the lobbying trip came from the mayor’s budget for conventions and seminars. The main topic they wanted to discuss with Alabama's congressional delegation was funding for a second study on a third bridge over the Tennessee River. TTL Inc., along with Pugh Wright McAnally and Jacobs Engineering, completed an initial study that determined the region needs a new bridge because of heavy traffic congestion on U.S. 31 and the Hudson Memorial Bridge. The next phase would include environmental fieldwork, a more extensive traffic study and selection of the most effective bridge location. Engineers could then begin design, engineering, right-of-way acquisition and construction. Dewayne Hellums, Decatur-area Metropolitan Planning Organization director, said Thursday that MPO needs $4 million to $5 million for the second phase. “We’re done with the first phase, and the council approved it in April,” Hellums said. “Now we’re waiting to find out when the second phase is a go.” Decatur paid $1 million and also received a $1 million federal grant from the Appalachian Regional Commission for the first phase. “We’re going after federal and state money for the second phase,” Hellums said. McMasters said the congressional delegation “is keenly aware we need some money for a bridge, and they are very supportive of it.” He said the delegation knows Decatur is getting an inland port. In March, the city found out it is getting a Port Authority inland rail facility that will transfer shipping containers between rail and trucks. Expected to be ready in 2025, the facility will help goods from Mobile reach the rest of the state. “The port could bring more traffic,” McMasters said. “We’re trying to get ahead of this issue, and a bridge is a big part of our needs.” Bowling said Tuberville recently said there’s a need for additional infrastructure in the region. “That includes the need for a river bridge,” Bowling said. “This is a project that will impact the whole region, not just Decatur. They want to help us.” Congress is in session now and is working on appropriations and the fiscal 2026 budget. “We want to be optimistic but, if you watch the news, you know these are some very challenging times right now in Washington,” Bowling said. Bowling said it would be sometime in 2025 before they know and then receive any federal funding. For example, he said it was March before Pryor Field Regional Airport received $3.2 million for the first phase of a southeast taxiway.",
