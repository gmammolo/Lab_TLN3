  "text": "Deputy Prime Minister reveals how many women carry out combat missions on front line More than 10,000 women soldiers are currently performing combat missions directly on the front line, according to the Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine Olha Stefanishyna. &quot;Ukrainians resist Russian aggression as a united people - both women and men. More and more women are serving in the defense forces, and currently, over 10,000 women are performing combat missions on the front line,&quot; said Stefanishyna. She also emphasized that the role of women is crucial in the country&#039;s recovery, particularly in developing Ukraine&#039;s economic potential. &quot;We have also rethought the role of women in the recovery and reconstruction of Ukraine. We already have a large program that envisions women having more access and being actively involved in the recovery and reconstruction process,&quot; noted the Deputy Prime Minister. Women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine According to the Ministry of Defense, almost 70,000 women are currently serving in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, most of whom are military personnel. In October of last year, we reported that since 2021, the number of women in the Ukrainian army has increased by 12,000, or 40 percent.",
