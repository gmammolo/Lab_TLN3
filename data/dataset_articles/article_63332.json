  "text": "1 de 1 President Lula — Foto: Cristiano Mariz/Agência O Globo President Lula — Foto: Cristiano Mariz/Agência O Globo\nThe approval rating of President Lula has improved and reached its highest level this year, according to a public opinion survey by Genial/Quaest released on Wednesday. The survey shows that Mr. Lula’s approval rating is at 54%, four percentage points higher than the previous survey conducted in May, while disapproval declined to 43% (from 47%). The last survey by the institute, at these evaluation levels, was conducted in October 2023.\nThe increase is attributed to the perception of economic improvement, especially among the poorest, voters aged between 35 and 59, earning up to two minimum wages, and residents in the Southeast region. In this group, the president’s approval rating increased and disapproval decreased considerably. However, the majority of Brazilians believe that the country’s economy has worsened in the last 12 months.\nConducted between July 5 and 8 with 2,000 in-person interviews, the Genial/Quaest survey measured the respondents’ opinions on recent tensions, as expressed by Mr. Lula in different interviews, between the Planalto Palace, the president of the Central Bank, Roberto Campos Neto, and the financial market. According to Mr. Lula, both are acting politically against his government.\nFor 66% of respondents, President Lula is right (only 23% disagree) in criticizing the Central Bank’s interest rate policy, which has been the target of his criticism since he returned to office for his third term in January 2023.\nMr. Campos Neto was appointed by former President Jair Bolsonaro to lead the Central Bank, a position he has held since February 2019. Public displays of closeness to Bolsonarism have unsettled the Workers’ Party base, such as when he went to vote in the 2022 elections wearing the Brazilian national team jersey. Recently, he agreed to participate in a ceremony at the Legislative Assembly of São Paulo and a dinner hosted by São Paulo’s Governor Tarcísio de Freitas, a political protégé of Mr. Bolsonaro.\nIn recent interviews, in addition to criticizing the Central Bank and its leader, Mr. Lula also stated that he should not be accountable to the financial market, but rather to the people. The majority (67%) of respondents agree with the statement. For 53% of them, the president’s statements did not contribute to the rise of the exchange rate, while 34% believe they influenced the rate’s fluctuation. Most economists and analysts attributed the rise in the exchange rate to the president’s statements, which he countered by calling the movement a “speculative attack” against the real.\nDisapproval of Mr. Lula is higher among individuals earning more than 5 minimum wages, white, male, evangelical, with some college education (even incomplete), and residents of the South region.\nRegarding the economic situation in Brazil, 36% of respondents believe the economy has worsened in the past year, while 32% see stability and 28% see improvement. Positive evaluations of the economy increase among the poor, and negative assessments are much higher among the wealthy. However, there is unanimity across all social classes regarding purchasing power: it is much lower today compared to the previous year. Yet, the majority of the people interviewed (52%) are optimistic and expect economic improvement in the next 12 months.\nThe survey was conducted jointly by Genial, an investment platform, and Quaest, a company specializing in data intelligence. The margin of error for the survey is two percentage points up or down.\nTranslation: Marina Della Valle",
