  "text": "I am writing to publicly thank Congressman Ryan Zinke for his support of America’s military.\nCongressman Zinke is a retired Navy SEAL who was a part of SEAL Team One and SEAL Team Six. He earned numerous medals while serving, including two Bronze Stars, and served on Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. After 23 years of service, he retired as a Commander.\nZinke’s dedication to America is evident through his military service and he continues to be dedicated now as a Representative for Montana in Washington, D.C.\nIn June 2024, he voted to fully fund veterans’ healthcare programs. In July 2023, he voted for the National Defense Authorization Act to fund for the United States military and raise pay for our troops. Also in July 2023, he voted to fund veterans’ benefits and veterans’ programs.\nShockingly, these bills were not passed with unanimous, bipartisan support. Somehow, it has become a bold claim for members of Congress to unabashedly stand with our troops.\nA veteran with a strong backbone is rare these days, and for the sake of future generations, we need more veterans — especially statesmen like Ryan Zinke — elected to our government. If you agree, join me in electing more veterans to Congress.\nJohn Lind\nBelgrade\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Tags Ryan Zinke United States Politics Of The United States Federal Government Of The United States United States House Of Representatives Executive Branch Of The Government Of The United States Government Legislative Branch Of The United States Government Veteran Military Military Of The United States United States Congress American Politicians Politics Featured Local Savings Recommended for you sponsored",
