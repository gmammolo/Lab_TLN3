As many as 2.20 lakh acres have already been sown directly, which was 1.72 lakh acres in 2023.” By: Express News Service July 12, 2024 11:58 IST Follow Us The minister also reviewed the status of maize kharif sowing, for which the state is providing Rs 100 as a subsidy on the purchase of every 1 kg of hybrid maize seeds. The Punjab government will provide over 22,000 Crop Residue Management (CRM) machines on subsidy to manage paddy straw scientifically in the state, Punjab Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Minister Gurmeet Singh Khudian said Thursday.\nChairing a meeting to review the status of various schemes and projects undertaken by the department, the minister asked officials to ensure the draw of lots for the subsidized CRM machines should be held this month and subsidy must be released to the beneficiary farmers by August-end, before the starting of paddy harvesting to accomplish the ambitious plan to reduce farm fires to zero.\n“CM Bhagwant Mann -led state government laid out an action plan of Rs 500 crore for making available CRM machinery to farmers on subsidy during the paddy harvest season 2024-25. Farmers can avail 50 per cent subsidy on the cost of CRM equipment, while 80 per cent subsidy is for cooperative societies, FPOs and panchayats”, he added.\nAdvertisement Appreciating farmers for giving positive responses to the Direct Sowing of Rice (DSR), Khudian said, “The state has witnessed a 28 per cent surge in the area under this water-conserving technique in comparison to last year. As many as 2.20 lakh acres have already been sown directly, which was 1.72 lakh acres in 2023.”\nHe directed department officials to pull all stops to accomplish the target of sowing 5 lakh acres by adopting DSR this season. Punjab Government is providing Rs 1,500 financial assistance to encourage the farmers to opt for DSR, he said.\nThe minister also reviewed the status of maize kharif sowing, for which the state is providing Rs 100 as a subsidy on the purchase of every 1 kg of hybrid maize seeds.\nDirector, of Agriculture, Jaswant Singh apprised the Cabinet minister that the kharif maize had so far been sown in 1 lakh acres, and assuring that the target of bringing two lakh acres under the kharif maize would be accomplished.\nAdvertisement Asking department officials to continue the onslaught against the sale of spurious/substandard agriculture inputs, the minister made it clear that nobody would be spared if found indulging in the malpractice, “The government is fully committed to ensuring quality seeds, fertilisers and pesticides to the state farmers,” he added.\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 12-07-2024 at 11:58 IST Latest Comment Post Comment Read Comments Advertisement Cong Dalit leader says family will convert to Islam if BJP MLA, husband don’t face action Cities Updated: July 12, 2024 11:31 IST Congress's Junagadh city SC/ST cell president Rajesh Solanki has given an ultimatum to the BJP government to take action against BJP MLA Geetaba Jadeja and her husband for allegedly assaulting his son.
