  "text": "Supreme Court Grants Interim Bail to Kejriwal in Excise Policy Case The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) praised the Supreme Court for granting interim bail to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in the excise policy scam case filed by the ED. Kejriwal remains in jail due to a separate CBI arrest related to the same case. AAP leaders called the verdict a 'victory of truth'. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| New Delhi | Updated: 12-07-2024 12:03 IST | Created: 12-07-2024 12:03 IST - Country: - India The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday lauded the Supreme Court for granting interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the excise policy scam case initiated by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), stating that this move has 'exposed' the BJP's 'conspiracy' against him. Despite the interim bail, Kejriwal, who is also AAP's national convenor, will continue to be in jail as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has detained him on corruption charges related to the alleged scam, while he was under ED custody. In a joint press briefing, AAP leaders Atishi, Saurabh Bharadwaj, and Sandeep Pathak hailed the Supreme Court's decision as a 'victory of truth.' Earlier, the party, in a Hindi post on X, declared 'Satyamev jayate (truth alone triumphs).' AAP claimed the BJP anticipated Kejriwal's bail from the Supreme Court in the ED's money laundering case, prompting his arrest by the CBI. Atishi defended Kejriwal's integrity, asserting he was, is, and will remain honest, and claimed that every legal institution has unveiled the BJP's 'conspiracy' against him. Rajya Sabha member Sandeep Pathak called the court order 'historic' and criticized the excise policy case as a 'circus' orchestrated by the BJP. AAP remains optimistic about Kejriwal obtaining bail in the CBI's excise policy case, according to Bharadwaj. The apex court, while granting the interim bail, noted that Kejriwal had been incarcerated for over 90 days.
