  "text": "The Biden administration’s recent “parole in place” initiative is a step in the right direction. It will keep families together by opening a pathway to citizenship for undocumented people, many of whom have called the U.S. home for decades. But declared just weeks after a separate order to shut the door on people fleeing persecution, President Joe Biden’s paired rollout of immigration actions bolsters the dangerous, long-standing thinking that relief for some immigrants must come at the expense of others. These Biden policies come amid claims from the GOP that we have “open borders” — when nothing could be further from the truth. Yes, migrants are arriving in high numbers, which is unsurprising given backlogs at the border from Donald Trump’s policies and COVID-19 restrictions, multiple failed governments in this hemisphere, and the impacts of climate change. And the federal government has failed to organize a coordinated response, putting unnecessary strain on major cities and reinforcing the idea of a “crisis.”\nAdvertisement Well-meaning people wonder why today’s immigrants don’t just come here “the right way,” presumably by filling out forms and waiting their turn. And the assumption, whether acknowledged or not, is that past generations of immigrants followed the rules.\nAdvertisement The ancestors of most white Americans came to the U.S. when there were no immigration rules — no visas, no passports, no work permits. No boxes to check or requirements to satisfy.",
