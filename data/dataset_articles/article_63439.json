  "text": "Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. on Friday vowed that his administration is focused on eradicating criminality, specifically the operations of illegal Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs).\nMarcos made the commitment during the distribution of presidential aid to farmers and fisherfolk in Pampanga.\n\"Alam ko rin po, na labis ang inyong [pagkabahala] sa mga kriminalidad at ilegal na mga gawain na sumisira sa kapayapaan ng inyong pamayanan. Nais ko pong ipaalam sa inyo na amin pong tinututukan at tinutugunan ang problemang ito,\" Marcos said in his speech.\n(I am aware that you are deeply concerned about criminality and the illegal activities that are destroying the peace and order of your community. I want to let you know that we are focused on and addressing this problem.)\n\"Sa katunayan, mayroon [nang] ginawang task force [ang] DILG para tutukan ang mga ilegal na gawaing kaugnay ng mga naririnig nating mga POGO at patuloy din ang pakikipagtulungan ng Bureau of Customs sa ilang ahensya upang matigil [na] ang pagpupuslit [ng] ilegal na droga dito sa bansa,\" he added.\n(In fact, the DILG has formed a task force on illegal activities regarding the POGOs that we have been hearing. The Bureau of Customs is also working with other agencies to stop illegal drugs from entering the country.)\nTo recall, a POGO firm in Porac, Pampanga is being investigated for alleged illegal activities linked to Chinese syndicates. More than 150 foreigners were rescued including Chinese, Malaysian, Burmese, and Vietnamese citizens. Some of those who were rescued were torture and kidnap victims.\nThe continued search on the POGO hub also led to the discovery of alleged uniforms of the Chinese military . Several butcher knives were recovered during the search of the compound. Authorities also seized packages allegedly containing shabu during the operated raids.\nAuthorities have also raided a POGO hub in Bamban, Tarlac which was allegedly used for illegal activities by scammers. Suspended Bamban Mayor Alice Guo is currently under investigation for alleged links to POGO activities in her town.\nSeeking to crack down on the personalities behind the Bamban POGO, authorities have recently raided villas at a leisure park in Mabalacat, Pampanga .\nFinance Secretary Ralph Recto earlier said he sent a letter to Marcos recommending the total ban of POGO operations in the country. The President has not made any decision yet on the matter.\nMeanwhile, Marcos also said the country's anti-narcotics agency would continue its operations against illegal drugs.\n\"Patuloy din po ang mga hakbangin ng PDEA upang masawata ang ilegal na droga,\" Marcos said. — VDV, GMA Integrated News",
