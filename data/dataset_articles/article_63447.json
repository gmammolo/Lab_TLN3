  "text": "Farmers, consumers and chemical users can be assured of the stable and secure future of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) after a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Board Chair were announced. Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Murray Watt appointed Dr Catherine Ainsworth as the APVMA Board Chair for a term of four years starting from 12 July 2024. Further strengthening this renewal, the APVMA Board has appointed Mr Scott Hansen as the new APVMA CEO for a five-year term as of 24 July 2024. Minister Watt said the new appointments were a sign of positive reform with the APVMA. \"After the final Rapid Evaluation into the APVMA, we knew there needed to be a change of gears within the organisation,\" Minister Watt said. \"The APVMA needs to be strong, well-functioning and orderly so our farmers, consumers, and overseas customers can be assured that we have the world's best chemical regulator. \"The appointments of Dr Ainsworth and Mr Hansen are important steps towards APVMA moving to a stronger future. \"Dr Ainsworth has significant experience in corporate governance, risk management, regulatory matters, financial management, agriculture and public health. \"She has extensive experience in administration and board roles, as the Director of Racing Analytical Services, and the Director and Deputy Chair of Harness Racing Victoria and the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria. Minister Watt said Mr Hansen was selected by the board as the best candidate for CEO following a merit-based selection process. \"Mr Hansen is an experienced leader with more than three decades of experience in managing large and complex organisations in primary industries. \"Mr Hansen also has a strong track record in driving innovation and culture change to lift performance. \"I want to congratulate both Dr Ainsworth and Mr Hansen and I'm looking forward to watching them continue to build a healthy culture of excellence within the APVMA.\" [here](/apvma-back-on-track-with-new-appointments-1274478/).",
