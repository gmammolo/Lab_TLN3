  "text": "The Aam Aadmi Party welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision to grant interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the liquor policy case and said the BJP should stop hatching conspiracies against opposition parties.\nAddressing presspersons, Delhi Minister Atishi said the Bharatiya Janata Party hatched a conspiracy to stop Kejriwal’s release from prison, hence they got him arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation. “BJP knew Arvind Kejriwal has been granted bail by the Rouse Avenue Court, they know that he will get bail from the Supreme Court too. That is why, they hatched another conspiracy and the day on which the bail hearing was scheduled in Supreme Court, they made CBI arrest Arvind Kejriwal a day before that.” “One after the other, every court in this country has exposed your conspiracy, every court is granting bail to Arvind Kejriwal. I would like to tell the BJP, end your arrogance and stop hatching conspiracy against other parties. Truth can be troubled but not defeated,” Atishi added. AAP National General Secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Sandeep Pathak termed the court order \"historic\" and alleged that the excise policy case was a \"circus\" by the BJP. He said the SC order is very “soothing”. Delhi Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj said the Prevention of Money Laundering Act is a black law and the party is hopeful that Kejriwal will also be granted bail in the excise policy case filed by the CBI. The Supreme Court granted interim bail to Kejriwal in the money laundering case registered in connection with an alleged liquor policy scam. However, Kejriwal was not released from Tihar jail as he has been remanded in a connected case registered by CBI.",
