  "text": "Republicans remain staunchly supportive of Donald Trump’s candidacy and platform as they prepare for their\nnational convention in Milwaukee.\nRepublican Party of Wisconsin Chairman Brian Schimming emphasized Republican unity behind nominating Trump versus Democrats’ uncertainty around President\nJoe Biden, in a news conference Thursday.\n“A week from today, Republicans will be nominating Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States,” Schimming said.\n“Hosting the RNC will solidify the gains that we’re making here in Wisconsin. I just finished three days in Milwaukee at the Republican National Committee meeting; it is a group solidly, solidly unified behind\nDonald Trump.”\nSchimming also expressed excitement about Trump’s vice president pick.\n“The great thing for Republicans on the vice-presidential nomination is we have a lot of good choices, we have a lot of good options to be vice president of the United States,” said Schimming.\n“Joe Biden has Vice President Harris, who polls just about as badly as he does.”\nWhen asked about his position on the state Supreme Court’s decision regarding the use of drop boxes, Schimming said it was politically motivated interference with the Legislature’s authority over election laws.\nHowever, he expressed confidence in Wisconsin’s election security measures overall.\n“But I’m state chairman of the party, and I have to deal with the law as it is in the state, whether it’s on drop boxes or any other issue,” Schimming said.\n“We’re going to do everything we can. And I feel confident because of our internal election integrity unit and all the efforts that we have statewide, we’ll be able to have confidence in the election results on Election Night. But if we end up in a recount situation, or there are other issues at hand, we’re going to deal with them.”\nDemocrat-supporting groups such as the Coalition to March have promised to protest near the convention.\n“If Trump thought Milwaukee was ‘horrible’ before, he won’t be happy when he’s met by a counter-convention from Democrats on the ground who will expose his extreme Project 2025 agenda,” Democratic National Convention Communications Director Rosemary Boeglin said.\nSchimming said he is not very concerned about disruptions from the anti-Trump protests, and he is excited for the RNC to start.\n“The convention here is going to kind of showcase what’s happening around the country,” Schimming said.\n“Wisconsin is oftentimes the most competitive of the swing states, particularly of the big seven swing states, but right now we feel confident about where we’re at.”\nThe post\nWisconsin Republicans ‘solidly unified’ behind Trump, hyped for convention appeared first on New York Post.",
