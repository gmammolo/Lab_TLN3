  "text": "The government has initiated several major public infrastructure projects in Aurora that are already making significant strides, President Marcos said on Friday.\nDuring the distribution of presidential assistance to local farmers and fisherfolk, the President detailed ongoing road, flood control, and airport developments in the province.\n“These projects include the cementing of the road connecting the coconut plantations from the town of Dinalungan to various markets in the province of Aurora,” President Marcos said.\n“We’re almost halfway done with the construction of the Dingalan-Baler Road Project, which costs over four billion pesos,” he pointed out.\nThe Baler Airport Development Project is also underway to accommodate larger aircraft. The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) completed a land purchase in June, with construction funds set to be released in August.\n“Next, we’ll build the Passenger Terminal Building. We hope the people of Aurora feel our care and love,” he stated.\nPresident Marcos reported on the completion of the Aguang River Flood Control Structure Project in Baler to address flooding. He also addressed the abandoned APECO (Aurora Pacific Ecozone and Freeport) project.\n“It’s really such a disappointment that what happened here could have been beneficial by now,” he said.\nAPECO President and CEO Gil Taway IV plans to rebid the nearly P796 million project for completion.",
