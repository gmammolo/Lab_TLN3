  "text": "The arrival of the MV San Fernando, the first container ship to dock at Vizhinjam port in Kerala on Friday, marks a turning point for India's maritime ambitions.Karan Adani, Managing Director of Adani Ports and SEZ Limited (APSEZ), which is developing the port, emphasized the significance of the event. This is not just a ship arriving at a port, Adani said. It's a symbol of India's growing role in global trade. Vizhinjam is now operational, and it's ready to transform India into a major player in transshipment. San Fernando – now berthed at our harbour is a symbol of a new, glorious achievement in Indian maritime history, said Adani, highlighting the significance of the occasion. It tells the world that India's first transshipment terminal and the largest deepwater port has begun commercial operations. Vizhinjam boasts cutting-edge technology, setting it apart from other Indian ports. No other port in India – including our own highly advanced Mundra Port – has these technologies, Adani remarked. We have already installed South Asia's most advanced container handling technology here. Prior to Vizhinjam, 75% of India's transshipped cargo was handled by foreign ports, despite the country's flourishing trade. Vizhinjam aims to change that. Vizhinjam will not only facilitate the movement of transshipment traffic into India but will also play a pivotal role in handling traffic along major routes connecting India, such as US-Europe-Africa and US-Europe-Far East, the statement said.The project is a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) between the Kerala government and the Adani Group, with a total investment of Rs 20,000 crore. By 2028-29, when all four phases of this project are completed, the investment will total Rs 20,000 crore, Adani informed. The public hearing for the port's masterplan has just been successfully completed, and we are humbled by the overwhelming support from the people of Vizhinjam. This development is expected to create substantial job opportunities. We have already created over 2,000 direct and indirect jobs, Adani said. With these wide-ranging developments, we will create more than 5,500 additional jobs right here in Vizhinjam. The arrival of MV San Fernando marks the commencement of operations at the first automated port in India. This 300-meter-long Maersk vessel, with a capacity of 8,000-9,000 TEUs, will offload around 2,000 containers at the port.Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan expressed optimism about the project's future. In a major development, Vizhinjam transhipment terminal is expected to be fully operational by 2028, ahead of its original 2045 schedule, he said. With its increased capacity, Vizhinjam port is poised to become a major hub for other ports. Adani also said, “Although we are expected to complete Phase 1 in December this year, I am delighted to announce that we will complete the first phase much before that. We already have 600 meters of operational quay length – and we are preparing 7,500 container yard slots to accept cargo. While we are expected to handle 1 million TEUs per annum in Phase 1, we are confident that we will handle 1.5 million TEUs – 50 percent more!”",
