  "text": "Strengthening international bonds and fostering new opportunities The enduring bonds of international friendship were on display as Northam hosted a visit from the German town of Helmstedt. On July 1 Northam’s Town Twinning Association, together with Northam Town Council hosted a short visit of around 40 visitors from Heldstedt’s Twinning Association who arrived from Chard in Somerset for a short lunch at Westward Ho!’s historic Royal North Devon Golf Club. They met representatives from Northam’s Twinning association and town council, lead by the deputy mayor Councillor Louis Bach. After lunch, representatives of both twinning associations, Harald Spitzer from Helmdstedt and Keith Lane from Northam, spoke about the importance of the ties of friendship that town twinning provides communities, both in Germany and Great Britain. Gifts were exchanged to mark the occasion of Helmdstedt’s visit. Both expressed hopes that this friendship would strengthen and offer opportunities for groups, clubs and organisations from both towns in the future. Visitors were then provided with a walking tour of historic Appledore, guided by members of Northam’s association and council where they experienced the calm beauty of its Georgian streets, lanes and ‘drangs’. This was followed by a coach tour of our area, including Westward Ho! seafront and through Northam’s historic centre before the visitors made their way back to Somerset before returning to Germany the next day. A spokesperson for Northam Town Council said: “Northam Town Council is proud of its links with friends across the channel both in France and Germany and supports the efforts of its twinning association. “Town twinning was set up after the Second World War to encourage friendly contact between the UK and countries in Europe at a local level. Northam Town, which includes Appledore and Westward Ho! has been officially partnered with Mondeville in Brittany, France since 1974 and Helmstedt (originally Buddenstedt) in Lower Saxony, Germany since 1983. “These relationships are not just something written on a sign or filed in official documents at the town hall; they are bonds of friendship stretching across the Channel encouraging an understanding of each other’s culture and history. Northam’s Twinning Association is a small but active voluntary group and welcomes new members from across the Appledore, Northam and Westward Ho! community.” Northam Twinning Association with Helmstedt guests (Credit : Graham Hobbs) Northam Twinning Association with Helmstedt guests (Credit : Graham Hobbs) Northam Twinning Association with Helmstedt guests (Credit : Graham Hobbs) Northam Twinning Association with Helmstedt guests (Credit : Graham Hobbs)",
