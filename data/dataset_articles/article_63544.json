  "text": "I’m tired of all the hand-wringing over President Biden’s poor performance in the recent presidential debate. Despite his lifelong struggles with a speech impediment, he has been a successful senator for decades, a stalwart vice president under President Obama and now president of the United States. I believe President Biden was able to defeat then-President Trump in 2020 because he is and has been a moderate Democrat. There is not much daylight between a moderate Democrat and a moderate Republican, something that Biden used to his advantage in 2020. Many of President Biden’s policies work well for all Americans, such as student loan forgiveness, immigration policy reform, living wage policies, and programs addressing the needs of women, people of color, new immigrants and the LGBTQ+ community. Any economist will tell us that this all depends on stability – of domestic socioeconomic policy, of international trade and finance, and especially of foreign policy and international relations. During his four years as president, Mr. Trump showed little interest in preserving any of these things. On the contrary, he sought to isolate the United States to the detriment of its allies. He also cozied up to Russia and North Korea, our adversaries. So to all Americans, I say, we can do far worse than electing President Biden, and we will do so if we elect Donald J. Trump as president again. Stephen Grant Thomaston Join the Conversation Please [sign into](#) your Press Herald account to participate in conversations below.
