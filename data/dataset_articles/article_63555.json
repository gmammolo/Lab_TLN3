  "text": "Negotiations continue next week President Bola Tinubu yesterday restated that workers deserve improved welfare and better wage.\nHe said it is not unusual to review minimum wage every two or three years.\nThe President noted safe and enhanced working conditions is the driving force of any nation.\nHe spoke during his meeting with leaders of Trade Union Congress (TUC) and Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) at Aso Villa.\nThe meeting, a major consultation ahead of decision on minimum wage, continues next week.\n“Why must we adjust wages every five years? Why not two? Why not three years? What is a problem today can be eased up tomorrow. There is much dynamism to this process if we are not myopic. We can take a surgical approach based on pragmatism and understanding of all factors,” he said.\nHe, however, stressed the need for realistic expectations on tminimum wage by stakeholders, noting the nation can only plan with its financial realities.\nThe President told the unionists his concern about workers’ welfare informed prioritisation of such by his administration.\n“I pay attention to everything around me. A happy worker is a productive worker and society depends on productivity of the happy worker”, a statement by his spokesman, Ajuri Ngelale, said.\nOn realistic expectations, Tinubu said: “You have to cut your coat according to the cloth. Before we can finalise on minimum wage, we have to look at the structure.\nRelated News NLC President, Joe Ajaero, emphasised need for an upward adjustment, noting “between living wage and minimum wage, we need to find a balance. Things are difficult for the worker”.\nTUC President, Festus Osifo, lamented the effect of inflation on the naira and that measures initiated by government to address rising cost of food and transportation need to give citizens relief.\nHe said the rollout of Compressed Natural Gas-powered buses will check high cost of transportation, while the directive on suspension of duty on certain food imports will bring down prices, if well implemented.\nTalks were adjourned till next week to allow for wider consultation by stakeholders.\nMinister of State for Labour and Employment, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha; Ajaero and Usifoh affirmed the meeting did not discuss anything in terms of naira and kobo.\nThe minister noted Tinubu only had a discussion with organised Labour as a father to children but hoped a solution will soon be found to the wage issue.\nMinister of Information and National Orientation, Mohammed Idris, who hoped there would be a positive result after next week’s meeting, said: “Recall that there is N62,000 that has been put out there from government side and the organised private sector but organised Labour is still not accepting that but we know they will come to the table, we know this is something going to be workable for Nigerians.\n“Labour and government will reach an agreement. We have adjourned for a week. The union has asked government to allow them a week to discuss further. We’re going to reconvene in one week and we hope and believe we’ll have something for Nigerians.\n“We do hope when we come together next week, we’ll have something we can put out for Nigerians to see and agree with.”",
