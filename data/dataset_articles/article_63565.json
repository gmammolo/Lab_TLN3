  "text": "WARNING: This story contains racist and offensive language.\nBigambul and Gomeroi woman Debra Fernando always looks forward to NAIDOC Week, and says this year's theme, 'Keep the fire burning! Blak, loud and proud', is more important than ever.\n\"We've got to keep sharing our knowledge, and [NAIDOC] is the space to do that,\" she said.\n\"To be blak, loud and proud — to have no shame.\"\nMs Fernando says she remains hopeful for the future, despite experiencing racism firsthand in the days after the Voice to Parliament referendum's 'no' result last year.\n\"I was sitting in my office when these young kids come past yelling out, 'There's that coon that lives there',\" she said.\n\"I thought, gosh, is this a reflection of the referendum result and the conversations they're around?\n\"It made me realise there could be another generation filled with hate.\"\nSupport for Indigenous Australians Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander crisis support line 13YARN on 13 92 76 eSafety Commission's First Nations resources Ms Fernando lives in the Riverina, in southern New South Wales, where 75 per cent of the local electorate voted 'no' in last year's referendum.\nShe felt her heart \"drop and shatter\" when the results were released.\n\"It felt like hopelessness,\" she said.\n\"I was sceptical if Australia had grown up; clearly it hasn't.\"\nDebra Fernando says she's still hopeful there will be a change in attitude. ( ABC News Graphics )\nBut Ms Fernando believes that sharing First Nations stories this NAIDOC Week can help to shape positive attitudes within the non-Indigenous community.\n\"I would like to see change in my lifetime,\" she said.\n\"To see that shift in Australia when everyone becomes equal.\"\n'We are resilient' Gamilaroi woman Marjorie Anderson says many people faced similar derogatory comments during the referendum debate.\n13YARN national program manager Marjorie Anderson, left, with colleagues Nikita Ridgeway and Jia Natty. ( Supplied )\nMs Anderson, the national program manager for 13-YARN, says her team saw the drastic toll negative attitudes towards Indigenous people took on communities nationwide.\n\"Our calls went through the roof,\" she said.\n\"The toxicity of the debate was incredibly damaging to Aboriginal people.\n\"It was almost like non-Aboriginal people felt like it was OK to be racist.\"\nMs Anderson said the helpline's crisis services had a 40 per cent rise in demand in the months before and after the Voice to Parliament referendum.\nThere was a 40 per cent surge in calls to the 13YARN helpline around the Voice to Parliament referendum. ( ABC News: Danielle Bonica )\nBut she thinks that despite the aftermath of the 'no' result, the debate was good for one thing.\n\"It gave [the nation] a better understanding of the cultural load for blakfellas,\" she said.\nMs Anderson says this has led to some progress in attitudes towards Indigenous employees.\n\"We see it in non-Aboriginal workplaces, where they take the initiative to ensure First Nations people feel supported,\" she said.\nAunty Dulcie's trailblazing career A complaint about a policeman ended Dulcie Flower's stint in a hospital emergency department. But it sparked a long career focused on improving the health outcomes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\nRead more\nShe echoes Ms Fernando's sentiment that this NAIDOC Week's theme inspires reflection and perseverance.\nMs Anderson says she hopes First Nations people continue to campaign, whether it be for a voice to parliament or for closing the gap initiatives.\n\"If Aboriginal people are anything, we are resilient,\" she said.\n\"We get knocked down over and over again, but we get back up.\n\"Our mob need to keep fighting for our young ones, for our future.\"\nA time to be proud Brandon Nixon, chief executive of Coonabarabran Land Council and a Gamilaraay man, says he felt the disappointment of local First Nations people when the 'no' result was released.\nBrandon Nixon says Indigenous people must share their stories so their culture remains strong. ( Supplied )\nBut he says his community will continue to use its voice despite the referendum result.\n\"We will not stop fighting for the rights of Aboriginal people and continuing to ensure that we have a say,\" he said.\nMr Nixon says this year's NAIDOC theme, 'Keep the fire burning,' is vital in motivating the community to move forward.\n\"The [theme] has allowed us to share who we are and our knowledge and ensure the local Gamilaraay culture lives on,\" he said.\n\"Coonabarabran has a rich culture, and we need to ensure that we share now so that fire keeps burning.\"\nBrandon Nixon says the Aboriginal rangers program will be a highlight this NAIDOC Week. ( Supplied: Coonabarabran Land Council )\nThe Aboriginal rangers program is one of the successes the land council will celebrate this week.\nThe program aims to help young First Nations people learn traditional land knowledge while gaining a Certificate III in Conservation.\n\"They're currently going through training and meeting regularly with elders,\" Mr Nixon said.\n\"This ensures our wisdom and stories are being passed down.\"\nMr Nixon hopes the program can continue empowering future generations of Indigenous people and make sure their voices are heard.\nCatch up on our NAIDOC Week content at the ABC Indigenous page and on ABC iView .\nEditor's Note 12/07/2024: The ABC has chosen to include offensive language in this story to illustrate the racism referenced in this reporting.\nPosted 6h ago 6 hours ago Thu 11 Jul 2024 at 9:02pm , updated 2h ago 2 hours ago Fri 12 Jul 2024 at 1:37am Share\nCopy link\nFacebook\nX (formerly Twitter)\nRelated Stories One-of-a-kind education program instils pride in self, culture among Aboriginal students NAIDOC Award winners are 'Blak, Loud and Proud' as Indigenous difference-makers hit the black carpet",
