  "text": "After its successful launch held recently in Taiwan, “ Go Green with Taiwan ,” a global initiative organized by the Taiwan International Trade Administration, Ministry of Economic Affairs (TITA, MOEA) and Taiwan Trade Center Manila (TAITRA), was launched in the Philippines to encourage Filipinos to submit innovative project concepts aimed to protect the environment while fostering economic sustainability.\n“Go Green with Taiwan” is a global contest for environmental sustainability project ideas to build a sustainable future, together with Taiwan, a country renowned for its world-leading technological advancements. It invites groups or individuals to come up with environmental and economic sustainability project concepts that will implement Taiwan’s green industry solutions while fostering technological relevance.\nProposals that will be submitted online shall undergo a rigorous qualification phase and be extensively reviewed by a panel of experts during the preliminary, semi-finals, and up to final competition stages.\nThe concept entries will be evaluated for their excellence in four (4) criteria, namely, environmental and economic sustainability, feasibility, innovation, and connections in terms of the use of products or solutions coming from Taiwanese companies.\nTo submit your environmental or economic sustainability project concept, just log on to the Go Green with Taiwan online submission form and input your proposal details.\nThis will already serve as your official entry to the contest — https://gogreen.surveycake.biz/s/eLGWV . The deadline for submission of proposals is until August 31, 2024.\nThree (3) proposals will be announced as global winners by December 2024.\nShown here are (from left) Roberto N. Galang, Ph.D (Dean, Ateneo School of Management), Raphael A. Guerrero, Ph.D (Dean, Ateneo School of Science and Engineering), Alex Lai (Director, Taiwan External Trade Development Council, Manila), Christine Kuo (Manager, Taiwan External Trade Development Council, Manila), Faye Martinez (Director, Philippine Marketing Association). To generate awareness about the initiative in the corporate sector and the academe, Go Green with Taiwan partnered with two reputable institutions, the Philippine Marketing Association (PMA) and the Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU).\n“ We are incredibly grateful to Ateneo de Manila University and the Philippine Marketing Association for partnering with us in this purposeful program in the Philippines. Together, we can empower Filipino minds and intelligence that not only benefit the Philippines but serve as a beacon of hope for a greener future on a global scale ,” says Director Alex Lai from the Taiwan External Trade Development Council Manila.\nLai likewise invited Filipinos to unleash their creativity by joining Go Green with Taiwan. “ We are eager to see how you turn ideas into action. Let’s go green, innovate, and let’s build a brighter future, together ,” he added.\nRoberto Galang, the Dean for Ateneo School of Management, representing Ateneo de Manila University, said the initiative perfectly aligns with Ateneo’s unwavering commitment to environmental responsibility, as embodied in the university’s “Laudato Si’ Plan of 2022-2029.”\n“ The ‘Go Green with Taiwan’ competition is aligned with the profound mission of Ateneo. It ignites the spark of creativity in young minds, inspiring them to bridge the gap between environmental sustainability and economic progress. Imagine Filipino ingenuity combined with cutting-edge solutions from Taiwan, a global leader in green technology! This is the kind of collaboration that can truly propel us towards a brighter future ,” Galang pointed out.\nGalang also reminded those who will submit proposals, that they are not just competing but also becoming architects of a greener future. “ So, let’s work together to turn ideas into action, and build a world where environmental responsibility and technological innovation go hand-in-hand .”\nFaye Martinez, Director of the Philippine Marketing Association, said that the Go Green with Taiwan campaign isn’t just about sustainability but also about unlocking a future brimming with innovation.\n“ Sustainability doesn’t have to be a burden – it can be an engine for growth. This is where the campaign comes in. It’s an opportunity for all of us, as seasoned marketing practitioners, to unleash our creativity and develop groundbreaking ideas to save the environment. Let’s go and influence the brilliant minds in this room to come up with innovative solutions that seamlessly integrate environmental sustainability into various business models across the Philippines ,” explains Martinez of PMA.\n“ Remember, the future is green, and the power to shape it lies in our creative hands. Let’s all join hands and redefine what’s possible ,” the PMA director added.\nWhat’s in store for the global finalists? Six (6) finalists will get an all-expense paid trip to Taiwan to present their entries.\nAt the end of the competition, each of the Top 3 global winners will receive US$20,000 — so visit https://gogreen.taiwanexcellence.org/ to learn how to join now!\nFor more details and updates about “Go Green with Taiwan” activities, follow Taiwan Excellence on Facebook and Instagram https://www.facebook.com/TaiwanExcellence.ph/ , https://www.instagram.com/taiwanexcellence_ph/?hl=en .",
