  "text": "Chief Whip of the Senate, Mohammed Ali Ndume, on Friday, hailed the administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for ‘liberating’ Local Government Councils from suffocation in the hands of governors.\nIn its Judgment on a case instituted by the Federal Government, the Supreme Court directed that local government allocations from the Federation Account should be paid directly to them, going forward.\nThe Supreme Court declared that it was unconstitutional for state governors to hold onto funds meant for Local Government Areas.\nIn its lead judgment, read by Justice Emmanuel Agim, the highest court in Nigeria, observed that the refusal of State Governments to guarantee financial autonomy for Local Governments has gone on for over two decades.\nJustice Agim said Local Governments have since stopped receiving the money meant for them from the state governors who act in their stead.\nHe noted that the 774 Local Government Councils in the country should manage their funds themselves. The revered Justice dismissed the preliminary objections of the defendants (state governors).\nIn a statement, Ndume described the judgment as the biggest achievement of President Tinubu so far since he assumed office in May 2023.\nThe Borno South lawmaker also called on President Tinubu to immediately commence the implementation of the court judgment without further delay, noting that the people at the grassroots must begin to feel the impacts of good governance.\nThe former Leader of the Senate, said since state governors hijacked the Local Government administration in Nigeria, by relying on a controversial section of the 1999 Constitution as amended, no meaningful development has happened at the grassroots.\nHe said: “This court action instituted at the behest of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is the biggest achievement of his achievement. I’m very happy about the development, and I’m hoping that this will be the beginning of the liberation of local governments in Nigeria.\n“I urge the President to immediately commence the implementation of the Court judgment. Local Government Councils need to start getting their monthly allocations immediately without any further delays. The people at the grassroots levels will begin to feel the impacts of good governance now.\n“The National Assembly made several attempts to amend the 1999 Constitution and address this grey area. But governors didn’t allow the State Assemblies to give the constitutional concurrence. That was how the attempts failed.\n“President Muhammadu Buhari also tried to intervene. Governors didn’t allow him. With this Supreme Court judgment, the issue has finally been rested. No more unnecessary deductions from funds earmarked for local governments.\n“The people can now hold the Council chairmen accountable on how they spend their monthly allocations. They’ll begin to demand true accountability and judicious use of the funds they’ll be getting. I salute the courage of President Tinubu.”",
