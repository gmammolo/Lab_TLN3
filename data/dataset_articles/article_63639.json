  "text": "Pavel: support for Ukraine at NATO summit almost unanimous With only one exception, all countries at the NATO summit in Washington agreed that Ukraine should be given whatever support it needs to defend itself militarily, Czech President Petr Pavel said at a press conference at the close of the three-day meeting of member states. He later clarified on social media site X that all countries in the alliance pledged further support for Ukraine with the exception of Hungary. He said the main topic of discussion was how concretely to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia. The Czech head of state also spoke about the need to stand up to Russia, saying that the Russian plan to assassinate the head of the German arms company Rheinmetall, uncovered by Germany and the United States, is further incontrovertible proof that Russia is waging a hybrid and information war against the West. He emphasised the need to let Russia know that none of these tactics would deter Western countries from doing what they consider to be right. The three-day summit of NATO leaders took place from 9–11 July.",
