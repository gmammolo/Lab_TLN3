  "text": "Screenshot from a BelTA video MINSK, 12 July (BelTA) – Belarus' decision to establish a union with Russia and build an alliance with post-Soviet countries has proved to be right, political commentator with the Rossiya Segodnya media group Vladimir Kornilov told the V Teme [On Point] project on BelTA's YouTube channel. “In the 1990s, Russia was a different state than it is now. We remember what it was going through after the events of 1993 and the victory of the liberals, who secured their grip on power for several years. Aleksandr Lukashenko made a difficult decision to build an alliance with Russia and this decision paid off,” said Vladimir Kornilov. The political observer recalled that Ukraine occasionally tried to make nice with Russia to gain certain benefits. “They proudly bragged about deceiving Russia, flaking on America and China. They wanted to thrive using the money from all of the above. As a result, this policy led Ukraine into a mousetrap. By the way, Aleksandr Lukashenko had warned Ukraine about this more than once,” he emphasized. According to Vladimir Kornilov, the path to integration in the post-Soviet space that Belarus once chose has proved to be worth it. “There can be no doubt about it. Indeed, an absolutely correct path was chosen then,” the political commentator said.",
