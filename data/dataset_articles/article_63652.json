  "text": "MINSK, 12 July (BelTA) - Thanks to the president, Belarus has been able to defend its sovereignty and independence more than once, public figure, founder of the charitable foundation, motivational speaker, member of the national Paralympic team, multiple world and European record holder in swimming Aleksei Talai said at the information and educational event \"Minsk - Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow\" dedicated to the 30th anniversary of the institution of the presidency in the Republic of Belarus in Minsk on 10 July, BelTA has learned. Aleksei Talai noted that over the past 30 years, the country has achieved significant results. He addressed the words of special gratitude to the doctors who pulled him out from the dead. This became possible thanks to the well-developed healthcare system. \"Most importantly, we have been able to defend the sovereignty and independence of the Fatherland, dear Belarus, more than once. The enemy is strong and insidious; this is absolutely clear to all sensible people. This is how things were and will be. In 2020, we stood together with the security forces, the people and the head of state who personally went out to the streets to defend the homeland with his sons. The enemy faltered. We must hold the line and defense,\" Aleksei Talai said. The event brought together senior officials of the Minsk City Executive Committee, its structural divisions, administrations of Minsk districts, deputies of the Minsk City Council of Deputies and the House of Representatives, heads of city and district organizations of the public associations and political parties, students and working youth, etc. Aleksei Talai noted that over the past 30 years, the country has achieved significant results.
