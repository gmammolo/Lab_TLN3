  "text": "Canandaigua, N.Y. — Sen. Chuck Schumer and members of the VA Finger Lakes Health Care are leading a new call to save Veterans Affairs from sweeping federal cuts.\nRecent reductions from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has called for the elimination of more than 80,000 jobs and a number of services from VA's nationwide.\nThe VA and Schumer held a press conference Wednesday, saying the changes will only hurt veterans services and cause chaos.\n\"They're killing the people that work here,\" said VA employee Ron Orlowski. \"They are going to be killing the veterans because they are not going to be getting the care they need. These veterans were promised care, they should have world class care. The VA provides world class care. Continue to provide it.\"\n\"I will not rest,\" Schumer said. \"I will fight every day to restore these cuts, to restore the jobs, and most importantly to give our veterans the healthcare they so need and deserve.\"\nThe Trump administration said the federal cuts are necessary to reduce government spending.\n_____",
