WIDE SHOTS OF NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL, AUDIO OF CHURCH BELL (2 SHOTS) 2. CLOSE-UP OF PADLOCKS ATTACHED TO METAL FENCE OUTSIDE CATHEDRAL 3. VARIOUS OF VISITORS OUTSIDE CATHEDRAL, PEOPLE IN QUEUE WALKING INTO CATHEDRAL 4. WIDE SHOT OF CRANES OUTSIDE CATHEDRAL 5. (SOUNDBITE) (French) ESTONIAN ARTIST IRINA BELLAYE SAYING: \"That day, I was at work — it was in the 15th arrondissement — and someone showed me a video and I thought it was an animation — I couldn’t believe it was real. But the person said, ‘No, no, no, it's live! It's really happening!’ And then… I couldn’t go back home. We prayed all night, and afterwards, I went to a friend’s house to spend the night. It was truly impossible to return home. It was incredibly sad. The whole world was crying — everyone. I was just across from Notre-Dame, right next to it… it was terrible. That smell and everything.

I went in for prayer — there was no queue like for the tourists, which was nice. It was all really well organized, just like before the fire.” 6. WHITE FLASH 7. (SOUNDBITE) (French) ESTONIAN ARTIST IRINA BELLAYE SAYING: “And I think it’s become even more famous. It was already known worldwide. But now, I saw the queue before going in — it was huge. And so many people were interested, of course. Even for prayer, I saw people from all over the world praying in different languages. It was… it was very heartwarming. And there were just so, so many people.\" 8. (SOUNDBITE) (French) UNIVERSITY STUDENT WENDY REAL-WITZ SAYING: \"Today I had the chance to visit Notre-Dame again, and especially to admire the Crown of Jesus. It's my second time, and honestly, it's very impressive. Unlike other cathedrals one might see, here you can clearly tell that there have been few changes — if I can say that — even though we didn’t get …",
