PROTESTERS HOLDING PHOTOS OF GAZAN JOURNALISTS AND CHANTINGPARIS, FRANCE - APR. 16, 2025: Journalists from across France gathered in Paris on Wednesday, Apr. 16, to show support for their Palestinian colleagues in Gaza, where Israeli attacks have continued for months. Hundreds of journalists from various media organizations assembled at Bastille Square, staging a symbolic protest on the steps of the opera house to raise awareness of the plight of media workers in the besieged enclave. Wearing white vests marked \"PRESS\" with red stains symbolizing blood, the demonstrators carried photos of Palestinian journalists who lost their lives during the ongoing Israeli offensive. Banners reading “Stop the massacre of journalists, solidarity with our colleagues” were displayed throughout the protest. At least 211 Palestinian journalists have been killed in Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip since October 2023, according to local authorities. The Israeli army renewed a deadly assault on Gaza on March 18, shattering a ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement that took hold in January. More than 51,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in Gaza in a brutal Israeli onslaught since October 2023. The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last November for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.

(SOUNDBITE) (French) ESTONIAN ARTIST IRINA BELLAYE SAYING: \"That day, I was at work — it was in the 15th arrondissement — and someone showed me a video and I thought it was an animation — I couldn’t believe it was real. But the person said, ‘No, no, no, it's live! It's really happening!’ And then… I couldn’t go back home. We prayed all night, and afterwards, I went to a friend’s house to spend the night. It was truly impossible to return home. It was incredibly sad. The whole world was crying — everyone. I was just across from Notre-Dame, right next to it… it was terrible. That smell and everything. And the last time I was there before the fire… it was a Sunday, and I remember — I went to a concert. That was just the night before the fire. The concert was amazing… I remember the huge stained-glass windows and everything.And now, when I went back in, everything was white. Of course, it has changed a lot. I don’t know… I always think that restoration is a good thing. But when I first entered, I smelled a very, very strange odor — kind of synthetic. For the first 30 minutes, I kept noticing that smell. I don’t know what it was. After a while, you get used to it, but I just want to say — it was strange. Otherwise, everything was good. I went in for prayer — there was no queue like for the tourists, which was nice. It was all really well organized, just like before the fire.” 6. WHITE FLASH 7. (SOUNDBITE) (French) ESTONIAN ARTIST IRINA BELLAYE SAYING: “And I think it’s become even more famous. It was already known worldwide. But now, I saw the queue before going in — it was huge. And so many people were interested, of course. Even for prayer, I saw people from all over the world praying in different languages. It was… it was very heartwarming. And there were just so, so many people.\" 8. (SOUNDBITE) (French) UNIVERSITY STUDENT WENDY REAL-WITZ SAYING: \"Today I had the chance to visit Notre-Dame again, and especially to admire the Crown of Jesus. It's my second time, and honestly, it's very impressive. Unlike other cathedrals one might see, here you can clearly tell that there have been few changes — if I can say that — even though we didn’t get …\nFrance 24flipped intoTop StoriesFrance to expel 12 Algerian diplomats, recall ambassador amid escalating tensionsFrance on Tuesday said it was going to expel 12 Algerian diplomats and recall its ambassador in a tit-for-tat move after the North African country ordered the departure of 12 French diplomatic staff over the weekend.
