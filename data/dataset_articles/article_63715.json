  "text": "Surrey health-care workers demand immigration justice\nPosted April 16, 2025 2:13 pm.\nLast Updated April 16, 2025 2:19 pm.\nHealth-care workers will hold a rally in Surrey on Thursday to protest federal cuts to an immigration policy that threaten their path to permanent residency.\nOn Tuesday, the B.C. government said the odds of new applications from immigrants looking to be accepted into its Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) this year have dropped to near zero for anyone other than health workers or entrepreneurs after the federal government slashed the number of available slots.\nA bulletin from the province says it was only allotted 4,000 nominations this year, about half of what it had last year and substantially less than the 11,000 it wanted.\nIt says the program, which helps immigrants already living in Canada gain permanent residency if they fill key jobs, will accept 1,100 new applications this year, mainly for doctors, nurses, and other health professionals, as well as entrepreneurs.\nThursday’s protest aims to pressure the government on restoring PNP spots for housekeepers, dietary aides, relational security officers, and many more health-care workers—people who rely on the immigration policy for a permanent, fair pathway to permanent residency.\nThe Hospital Employees’ Union (HEU) argues that B.C. can not afford to lose these essential health-care workers since the province is already struggling with health-care staffing shortages.\nThe union also stresses that the people affected by the PNP cuts are essential health-care workers with hard-to-fill jobs.\nHEU, which has more than 60,000 members in the province, says the protest will be held at King George Boulevard and will not disrupt hospital operations.\nThe rally is scheduled for 11 a.m. on Thursday.",
