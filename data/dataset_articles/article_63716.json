  "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — The Kyle City Council has approved a resolution to authorize a regional water supply lease agreement with the Green Valley Special Utility District (GVSUD).\nAt a special meeting held on March 29, the city council agreed to lease 0.652 million gallons of water per day (MGDs) annually from the GVSUD from its share of the Alliance Water Phase 1B water supply.\nAfter Alliance Water’s Phase 1C and 1D are completed, the lease will increase to a total volume of 1.42 MGDs per year.\nThe city of Kyle will be responsible for monthly fixed and variable charges in the lease agreement, including costs for operations, maintenance and special assessments in the water supply. The agreement also marks an initial two-year term with automatic one-year renewals.\nAccording to estimates from the city, the total costs for the next three fiscal years are expected to equal:\n- $425,430 in 2025\n- $591,347.88 in 2026\n- $498,982,48 in 2027\n\"This lease is a critical step in ensuring a sustainable water supply for both present and future residents of Kyle, helping us remain resilient during prolonged drought conditions,” Kyle Water Utilities Director Mike Murphy said in a news release sent on Wednesday. \"It’s a clear example of how the city council is committed to effectively managing our resources to meet the evolving needs of our community.\"\n“The partnership between Green Valley SUD and the city of Kyle is a strong example of collaboration and forward-thinking among our member entities,” Alliance Water Executive Director Graham Moore said. \"Alliance Water is proud to support this effort and looks forward to the upcoming water delivery to Kyle as we continue to build upon the city’s water supply.\"\nMore information on the Alliance Water Project can be found on the city's website.",
