  "text": "Lincoln mayor recognizes 911 dispatchers for National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week\nIn honor of National Public Safety Telecommunicators Week, Lincoln Mayor Lierion Gaylor Baird called their 911 dispatchers superheroes during a proclamation on Wednesday morning.\nLincoln's 911 center answers over half a million calls a year.\nTheir professionalism provides a key line to first responders.\nThat is critical in major events like last year's Arbor Day tornado.\n\"The gravity of that event impacted industry, it impacted lives, it impacted people just trying to do their day-to-day. Those natural weather events can be horrific. But the response of this team. They didn't miss a beat,\" Jessica Loos, Lincoln Emergency Communications Center director, said.\nTheir job has been even more challenging with nationwide staff shortages.\nLincoln's 911 center is currently down 14 positions.\nNAVIGATE: Home | Weather | Local News | National | Sports | Newscasts on demand |",
