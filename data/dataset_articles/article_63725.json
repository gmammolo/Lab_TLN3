  "text": "SALT LAKE CITY — From freeway interchanges to pedestrian bridges, the Utah Department of Transportation will have almost 300 projects this year.\nUDOT said Wednesday that 152 of those are new for 2025, and 145 are continuing from last year. The new projects total $1.68 billion.\nThe projects will also include bridges, new lanes, transit routes and trails.\nThe agency issued an advisory Wednesday, saying this is the start of their \"busy construction season.\" Some of the new projects have already begun, while others are expected to begin shortly or in the summer or fall. Drivers are urged to keep an eye out for announcements of closures and detours, and always drive carefully and patiently in work zones.\nUDOT shared links, details and cost estimates for some of the most significant projects that are kicking off this year:\n1800 North and I-15 intersection: Davis County– $385 million- This project will build a new interchange at the intersection of 1800 North and I-15 in Clearfield. Additionally, to accommodate current and future travel in the area, 1800 North will be widened up to 2000 West, an overpass at 500 West to cross the railroad will be added and other measures are planned to create space for a future Hill Air Force Base entrance gate. Work began in March and is expected to finish in fall of 2027.\n- This project will build a new interchange at the intersection of 1800 North and I-15 in Clearfield.
