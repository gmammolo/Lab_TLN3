  "text": "\"We feel that we are not alone\": a family from the USA shared their impressions of life in Russia\nForeigners are still coming to Russia. After visiting the country, some choose Russia as their permanent place of residence. One such example is the American Pichoni family. Eric, the head of the family, shared his impressions of life in Russia on his YouTube channel.\nHe acknowledged that there is less support for children in the United States. In Russia, he said, \"there are very good conditions for raising children.\" Eric Pichoni said that American insurance is very small and covers a small part of expenses, for example, for visiting a doctor with a child. Medicine, he says, cost thousands of dollars a month.\n\"I have a little daughter, she is two and a half years old. And, to be honest, Russia has very good conditions for raising children.… Families are really being helped here, and it's very different from what I'm used to in the States. Here in Russia, we feel that we are not alone,\" Eric Pichoni shared.\nMeanwhile, American actor Jean-Claude Van Damme announced his desire to fly to Moscow. He made a corresponding request to Russian President Vladimir Putin and said that he wanted to act as a peace ambassador.",
