  "text": "North Carolina Attorney General launches initiative protect Helene survivors from contractor fraud\nSafe to Rebuild initiative serves as a warning to would-be criminals\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - Law enforcement from across the High Country is teaming up with the state bureau of investigation and North Carolina Attorney General to protect people in the wake of Hurricane Helene.\nSix months after the storm, they are now preparing for an uptick in bad actors posing as people trying to help survivors.\n“We anticipate that may increase.. due to the building season coming on,” Avery County Sheriff Mike Henley said. “So you know, our objective is just to get ahead of this.”\nNorth Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson said western North Carolina is entering a new phase in the aftermath of Helene.\n“In the immediate aftermath of Helene, it was the recovery phase,” Jackson said. “We were worried mainly about price gouging. Now we’re out of that and more into the rebuilding phase. A lot of the rebuilding is going to be done by unlicensed contractors. Demand for their services is going to be very high. We’re glad that contractors are coming to Western, North Carolina, but we need them to know that if they treat people dishonestly, if they take advantage of people, they will be held accountable.”\nIn addition to warning potential criminals, the Attorney General’s office recommends consumers do the following:\n- Get written estimates and comparing bids.\n- Get a written contract.\n- Protect your payment. Never pay for most or all of the work before it’s completed and do not pay in cash.\n“If folks do literally no work, that’s actually a crime in North Carolina,” Jackson said. “Those contractors can face criminal consequences. A lot of them do partial work, and then it’s a question of, well, did you do the work that you said you were going to do?”\nJackson says a top priority for himself as attorney general is to educate the public about the power of filing reports to his office.\n“It doesn’t have to be a lot of complaints,” he said. “If there’s one highly detailed complaint, we will use that as the basis for an investigation.”\nHe says if a business does not respond to his office, they can escalate it.\nClick here for more information on the Safe to Rebuild Initiative and how to file a complaint with the North Carolina Attorney General’s Office.\nCopyright 2025 WBTV.
