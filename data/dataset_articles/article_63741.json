  "text": "Touring the Foodbank in Pharr Texas. Courtesy image Texas Border Business\nBy Roberto Hugo González\nMcAllen, Texas – Congresswoman Monica De La Cruz (TX-15) focused on two key challenges facing South Texans—food insecurity and labor shortages in agriculture—during a visit to the Rio Grande Valley Food Bank and a roundtable discussion with South Texas farmers.\nFarmers roundtable. Courtesy image Congresswoman De La Cruz toured the Rio Grande Valley Food Bank, the seventh-largest food bank in Texas, where she met with staff and volunteers to understand better the scope of hunger and food insecurity in the region. The food bank is vital in distributing meals, offering nutrition education, and connecting individuals to community services across South Texas.\nKey Problems Identified:\nRising Food Insecurity: With inflation and ongoing economic hardship, more families rely on food banks to meet basic needs. Limited Resources: Despite the food bank’s reach, it faces challenges in funding, food supply, and staffing to meet growing demand. Access to Nutrition Education: Many families lack knowledge about healthy food options and preparation, leading to long-term health issues. In a separate engagement, Congresswoman De La Cruz brought together South Texas farmers and agricultural producers for a roundtable discussion on the H-2A visa program. This federal program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign nationals for temporary agricultural jobs, which are an essential part of the labor force in South Texas.\nKey Problems Identified:\nAdministrative Burden: Farmers have previously voiced frustration with the complex and often delayed process of securing H-2A workers. Worker Shortages: Many farms operate with fewer hands than needed, threatening productivity and economic stability. Visa Cap and Inflexibility: Seasonal visa limitations don’t always align with regional harvesting timelines, making planning difficult for producers. Congresswoman De La Cruz, a member of the House Agriculture Committee, emphasized her commitment to championing policies that support food security and the agricultural workforce.\nHer visit emphasizes the interconnectedness of community well-being and a strong agricultural economy, and her actions signal a continued focus on solutions rooted in local input.",
