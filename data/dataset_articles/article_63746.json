  "text": "Politics & Government\nBeverly Mayor Mike Cahill Declares Re-Election Bid\nCahill said intends to run as the mayoral term shifts from two to four years beginning with this fall's election.\nBEVERLY, MA — Beverly Mayor Mike Cahill officially launched his anticipated re-election campaign this week in what will be the first four-year term in the city's history.\nCahill has served as mayor for the past 12 years — winning six, two-year terms.\n\"I am the right person to lead our great city forward during these uncertain times at the national level,\" he said in his re-election statement. \"With deep relationships at all levels of government and across our business and non-profit communities, I have the experience and the know-how to get things done.\"\nFind out what's happening in Beverlyfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nCahill said his priorities will be to make Beverly a place where everyone is welcome and is safe to live their lives free from discrimination, as well as a place where people can relocate to and choose to call their homes.\n\"We can ensure that Beverly continues to evolve in the coming years to meet all our residents' needs, while still preserving what makes our community special,\" Cahill said. \"I am invested in Beverly and want to continue to share this journey with you as your mayor.\"\nFind out what's happening in Beverlyfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nCahill, who also served on the School Committee and the negotiating committee during the recent Beverly teachers' strike, said his administration increased the school budget from $48 million to $85 million over the past dozen years, and that he will fight for changes to state aid to more equitably fund education across cities and towns.\nHe said another priority will be to work for state investments in public transportation as a means to ensure Beverly meets its housing needs and \"remains the thriving, livable community we love.\"\nCritical projects Cahill said that he intends to push include the Hall-Whitaker and Kernwood Bridge replacements, Varian site cleanup, the Brimbal Avenue highway intersection, and the ongoing National Grid transmission line and Bridge Street reconstruction projects.\n\"I am the only candidate for mayor with the proven ability to expertly manage the over $180 million city budget, the only candidate who knows how to navigate the challenges this city will face over the coming four years,\" he said.\nCahill cited the increase of the city's \"Rainy Day\" fund from $750,000 to more than $23 million, new emergency services dispatch system, new fire ladder truck, new Beverly High School fields, street paving projects, LED street light project, fire station renovations and parks projects as among the accomplishments during his tenure.\n\"We have done this while carrying strong cash reserves year to year, which, together with our Rainy Day funds, will carry us through the next recession. Further, we have formalized our strong financial policies, and we've upgraded Beverly's bond rating to AA+ during my tenure,\" Cahill said. \"We have done all this and more, while at the same time solidifying Beverly's financial strength and preparing our city to withstand future economic hard times.\n\"Serving the people of Beverly as our mayor continues to be the great honor and privilege of my professional life. ... Beverly needs a strong, proven leader now more than ever. I believe that person is me. I am forever invested in this wonderful community and in you. Please continue to invest in me.\"\n(Scott Souza is a Patch field editor covering Beverly, Danvers, Marblehead, Peabody, Salem and Swampscott. He can be reached at Scott.Souza@Patch.com.
