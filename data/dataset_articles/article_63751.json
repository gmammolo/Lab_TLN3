  "text": "City of Huntsville announces improvements to South Derrick Street Camp\nHUNTSVILLE, Ala. (\nWAFF) - The City of Huntsville announced improvements to the South Derrick Street Camp on Wednesday. The camp had to be shut down and cleared out last year because of a fire.\nOver the past few months, the city has been making improvements to the lot, hoping to prevent problems in the future.\nImprovements include:\n- Removing debris, clearing brush and disposing of illegally dumped concrete\n- Pouring a hard-surface pad, which replaces the previous dirt lot to offer a more stable and sanitary surface\n- Creating a 12’x12’ grid system with 84 individual spaces to provide more structured living areas\n- Equipping each space with a 10’x10’ tent attached to a platform to keep occupants’ belongings off the ground\n- Installing a metal privacy fence around the camp’s perimeter to enhance security\n- Creating new entryways for emergency vehicle access\nWAFF 48 is told people will be able to start coming back in a gradual process starting next week.\nCity leaders said there will be rules enforced on the property designed to keep everyone safe.\n“The goal of these new community standards is to ensure safety and sanitary conditions in the camp,” said Community Development Manager Scott Erwin. “These guidelines were developed in consideration of the concerns raised by occupants and in coordination with CoC providers.”\nThe city says the camp is meant to be a temporary place for people to get help. They’ll be paired with organizations that can assist them in getting into more permanent shelter.\nClick Here to Subscribe on YouTube: Watch the latest WAFF 48 news, sports & weather videos on our YouTube channel!\nCopyright 2025 WAFF.
