  "text": "Gov. Tim Walz visits new Dilworth fire station\nDILWORTH, Minn. (Valley News Live) - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz (DFL) was in Dilworth today. He visited the town’s newly-built fire station, which is still under construction.\nThe previous station has been operating since 1980, and was in need of a much-needed makeover. They broke ground last May, and have made significant progress since then.\nThe new station is nearly fully-functional, and is set to be completed this summer. The Dilworth Fire Chief, Scott Payne, said firefighters moved into the building just two days before the event.\nGovernor Walz received a tour of the new facility, which was funded by a nearly $3 million dollar infrastructure bill for state projects - all signed by Walz in 2023.\nThe Minnesota Governor was previously in Dilworth in 2021 showing his support for the project.\nToday, April 16, Gov. Walz again showed his support for bonding bills like these to protect people across Minnesota.\n“Tax dollars from all over the state helped build this because we understand how important the community is and your safety, too,” he said. “This is such a good thing for the community. It’s a good thing for citizens to see that the government is able to work together in a pretty much non-partisan manner, and we’re able to get world-class facilities like these.”\nHe said the work being done in Dilworth, such as the fire station, should be a ‘model’ for other communities statewide.\n“If I were other communities, I would come here and take a snapshot of what this community did. I would make that the model of how you move things forward. This has just been a positive experience, and for me to be able to come back here, it’s been great,” said Walz.\nCopyright 2025 KVLY.
