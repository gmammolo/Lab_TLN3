  "text": "University of Georgia students, faculty and other members of the Athens-Clarke County community gathered at North West Lawn near the Miller Learning Center on Wednesday, April 16 to protest the recent revocations of international student visas. Demonstrators demanded the UGA administration and University System of Georgia take action against ICE and to protect their international students.\nThe protest was organized by UGA’s Young Democratic Socialists of America and the UGA chapter of the United Campus Workers of Georgia. They were joined in support by organizations including other chapters of UCWGA and the Party for Socialism and Liberation.\nKeegan Brooks, a junior anthropology and political science major, assisted in the organization of the event as a member of UCWGA-UGA.\nAccording to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the Trump administration has revoked hundreds of international student visas, targeting international students who have participated in activism.\n“A lot of these international students, some of these revoked student visas are for online political speech, but many of them are for any sort of history of a law enforcement interaction,” Brooks said.\nUCWGA-UGA is in contact with students in Georgia, including UGA and Kennesaw State University, who’ve been personally impacted by their loss of a student visa.\n“You’ve seen universities in other states providing more support than what’s necessarily happening here at UGA,” Brooks said.\nDuring the protest, Brooks spoke in addition to university math professor Joe Fu and undergraduate students Aspen Davis, Moss Joslin, Dylan Woolsey and graduate student Tom Sheehan.\nDemonstrators held signs saying “TRUMP ADMIN & UGA: HANDS OFF OUR STUDENTS!” “RESTORE ALL STUDENT VISAS NOW!” and “In the name of humanity, WE REFUSE TO ACCEPT A FASCIST AMERICA.”\nJoslin, a member of UCWGA-UGA and senior science illustration major, spoke at the protest, addressing Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s mistaken deportation, and refusal of his return by El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.\n“The world moves on, but we are in crisis,,” Joslin said. “ICE is moving, tracking people, kidnapping them off the street daily, forcing students to be deported … We are standing up. We are showing the university that we want to protect our international students.”\nJoslin went on to challenge the crowd.\n“Wake up people,” Joslin said. “Now is the time to know our neighbors so that we can bring the fight to them ourselves.”",
