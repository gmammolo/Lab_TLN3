  "text": "ATLANTA — U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, already a veteran of very expensive political campaigns, raised $11 million in donations in the first three months this year for a reelection campaign with national implications.\nOssoff, who is up for reelection in 2026, made his name in national Democratic politics during his last two campaigns with a sharp message, aggressive style — and a knack for raising massive sums from outside Georgia.",
