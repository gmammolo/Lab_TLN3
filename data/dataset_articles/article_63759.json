  "text": "CCJ celebrates 20th anniversary\nPORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (CMC) — The Caribbean Court of Justice is on Wednesday celebrating its 20th anniversary with the outgoing President Justice Adrian Saunders saying, “today is a time for reflection and giving thanks”.\nThe judicial institution of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), established in 2005 to replace the London-based Privy Council as the region’s highest and final court, has both an appellate and original jurisdiction. It also serves as an international tribunal interpreting the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas that governs the 15-member regional integration grouping.\nSaunders, the third Caribbean national to head the Trinidad-based court following the late Justice Michael de la Bastide and Sir Dennis Byron, said for the past 20 years, the CCJ has upheld the rule of law, safeguarded rights and strengthened Caribbean jurisprudence.\n“The court has been a shining example of Caribbean ingenuity, with its innovative funding arrangement, in the form of the CCJ Trust Fund, and, through the establishment of the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission, its insulation from external interference in its recruitment practices,” said the St Vincent and the Grenadines born jurist.\n“This anniversary is not just a celebration of 20 long years, but also of our enduring commitment to delivering accessible, fair and efficient justice to the people and states of the Caribbean.\n“It is a privilege and an honour to serve the people of this region, and we, the judges and staff of the court, are incredibly grateful to have had that opportunity over the past 20 years. We look forward to doing so for the next 20 years and beyond,” Justice Saunders said.\nThe milestone was celebrated with an Interfaith Service of Reflection and Prayer at the Queen’s Hall, in St Ann’s on the outside of the capital, which was also attended by the Trinidad and Tobago head of state, Christine Kangaloo.\nIt was also attended by members of the Judiciary of Trinidad and Tobago, government, the Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO), regional stakeholders, members of the diplomatic corps, the legal fraternity, and commissioners of the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission (RJLSC).\nRJLSC member, Sophia Chote SC, told the ceremony that the achievements of the CCJ are the achievements of the Caribbean region.\n“We continue to have commissions which are responsible and which ensure that the CCJ’s bench is populated only with the best. The judges themselves are acutely aware of their responsibility to the region and discharge their duties with diligence and integrity,” she said.\n“The registrar and her staff and other arms of the organisation continue to perform their duties with responsibility and innovation. The educational arm of the CCJ has had valuable outreach with judges, lawyers and law students throughout the region,” Chote added.",
