  "text": "Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts has landed a spot on TIME’s 2025 Top 100 Most Influential People list, recognized not only for his NFL achievements but also for his profound impact on the Philadelphia community through charitable endeavors. At just 26, the Channelview, Texas native was only on of six athletes to make TIME's yearly list.\nOff the field, Hurts’ charitable efforts have transformed lives in Philadelphia. Through his Jalen Hurts Foundation, launched in 2024, he has focused on empowering youth through education and sports. His “Keep It Cool” campaign donated $200,000 to install air conditioning in Philadelphia public schools.",
