  "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Ventures Fund I LP has surpassed its goal of raising $150 million to build a portfolio of about 30 investments, a person familiar with the matter said.The fund, which invests in early-stage startups and has had a strong focus on payments and stablecoins, now expects to close at the end of June with $175 million to $180 million raised, according to the person, who asked for anonymity because the amount hasn’t been made public. A spokesperson for New York-based Galaxy declined to comment.The fund is closing at a time when venture funding is still hard to come by in the crypto industry. Despite a friendlier environment for digital assets in the US and globally, venture capital activity has largely remained at a standstill. Crypto VC investments in the US decreased 22% to about $1.3 billion in the first three months of the year, according to data compiled by Pitchbook.Key Speakers At The iConnections Global Alts 2024 EventThe digital-asset firm’s Galaxy Ventures has long invested between $30 million and $50 million a year of Galaxy’s own money into various crypto startups.

Galaxy has also made investments into the fund as well.Galaxy recently received permission for a direct listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange, with trading expected to happen after a special shareholder meeting in May.Most Read from Bloomberg©2025 Bloomberg L.P.",
