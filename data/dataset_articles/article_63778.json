  "text": "Gov. Morrisey touts W.Va. microgrid bill\nBLUEFIELD, W.Va. (WVVA) - West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey is touting what he believes to be a major economic opportunity for the mountain state.\nMorrisey called West Virginia “the single best place in America for data centers.” Morrisey says a recently passed microgrid bill will attract investment from companies all over the world who are looking for their own personal power grid to conduct business.\nWVVA spoke with Morrisey about the microgrid bill on Wednesday after he unveiled the state’s Mountaineer Mile Trail initiative.\n“It’s going to set up a framework where we can be able to attract a massive amount of capital to our state which could lead to jobs and really for our future,” said Morrisey.\nOnce in place, the law will allow companies to utilize coal, natural gas and other resources to power the smaller power grids.\n“I know a lot of times people have always asked me what does West Virginia need to do to get to the next level? These ideas about clearing the regulatory pathway, being much more attractive than other states. That’s how we’re going to get it done,” said Morrisey.\nMorrisey says it will likely take a few years before the state can see the benefits of the bill.\n“We’ve planted the seeds. That’s something that could be a very big tree and I’m thrilled about it,” said Morrisey.\nMorrisey says there will likely be some special sessions in the legislature revolving around PEIA as well as tax reform.\nWatch WVVA on your phone, Roku, Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV stick.\nCopyright 2025 WVVA.
