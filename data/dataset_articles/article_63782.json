  "text": "FIFA President Gianni Infantino on Wednesday said that he has “received assurances from the White House that, despite increased scrutiny of visitors to the country since President Donald Trump’s return to office, fans from abroad will be welcomed for the 2026 World Cup,” according to Steven Goff of the WASHINGTON POST. After meeting Trump last month in D.C., Infantino met with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel last week in Miami to “discuss security and potential issues involving the expected hundreds of thousands of fans from abroad” expected to attend the tournament. Infantino on Tuesday “discussed matters” with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Infantino on Wednesday said, “It is very important we have the engagement of the different government agencies to make sure that security is guaranteed, that fans can travel to the U.S. and around the U.S., that transportation is working perfectly, that the world will be welcomed.” Goff notes in early March, Trump established a White House task force that he will chair to “coordinate federal agencies in ‘planning, organizing and executing’” both the Club World Cup this summer and 2026 World Cup. Infantino said, “We got all these guarantees from the government, who is very, very engaged to make sure this Club World Cup is a huge success, because this will pave the path as well for next year” (WASHINGTON POST, 4/16).",
