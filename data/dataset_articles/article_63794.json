  "text": "WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Rhode Island blocked Trump administration agencies from freezing funds awarded through two high-profile laws enacted during the Biden administration — a bipartisan infrastructure law and a separate climate, tax and health care package.\nJudge Mary S. McElroy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island on Tuesday ruled in favor of groups that filed a lawsuit last month, after a Trump executive order in January instructed agencies to “immediately pause” the disbursement of funds appropriated via the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act from 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.",
