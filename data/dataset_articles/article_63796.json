Sharnell Tull has called the city her home for her entire life, and is the first African American woman to serve in her district.\n“You might now even have to touch the door next time, you can just breeze on through, the person underneath me or coming up, or the little black kid that sees me, they might not even have to touch the door.”\nShe hopes to make Pocomoke City a bustling area for businesses and fellowship. She has said her mother strived for when she was younger.\nTull hopes to make Pocomoke thrive again.\n“Trying to bring people here, bring new projects here, bring new businesses here. Pocomoke used to be a bustling and busy town. I used to hear stories that Pocomoke was the town that people visited to enjoy.”\nSharnell Tull will be in office for the next 4 years.",
