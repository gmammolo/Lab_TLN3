  "text": "GB News\nA White House official said an agreement was expected in 'two weeks or maybe three'\nTrending on GB News\nWhite House officials believe a trade deal with Britain can be finalised within three weeks, sources have claimed.\nAn insider familiar with the strategy told The Telegraph that London was in a good position for a rapid deal.\nHowever, the UK will likely be in a second wave of announcements, following Japan, India, and South Korea.\nDonald Trump wants to reach agreements with these countries first in order to isolate China.\nBritain was slapped with a blanket 10 per cent tariff on nearly all goods imported into the US after Trump's \"liberation day\" move to reset global trade\nREUTERS\nA White House official told The Telegraph that an agreement was expected \"soon\", saying: \"Two weeks or maybe three.\"\nIt comes a day after JD Vance, the US Vice-President, sent the Ftse 100 surging by predicting that Trump would agree a \"great\" trade deal with London.\nVance cited Trump's \"cultural affinity\" with Britain as a key factor, telling Unherd: \"There's a real cultural affinity.\"\n\"And of course, fundamentally America is an Anglo country... I think there's a good chance that, yes, we'll come to a great agreement that's in the best interest of both countries.\"\nMORE LIKE THIS:\nVance added that they were \"working very hard with Keir Starmer's Government\".\nBritain was slapped with a blanket 10 per cent tariff on nearly all goods imported into the US after Trump's \"liberation day\" move to reset global trade.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said there were already 15 trade deals on the table.\nMore than 75 countries have reached out to strike agreements before the end of a 90-day pause on more aggressive tariffs.\nTrump officials have said Britain was in a good position for a fast deal because it imports more goods from the US than it exports.\nHowever, they also caution that nothing can be taken for granted with Trump's unpredictable style.\nSteve Bannon, Trump's former strategist, said a deal with the UK would be among the simplest and fastest to negotiate.\n\"You (Britain) don't make anything anymore,\" he said. \"You don't make anything we're trying to bring back. That's why Japan and Korea will be tough.\"\nMore than 75 countries have reached out to strike agreements before the end of a 90-day pause on more aggressive tariffs\nREUTERSHe added: \"Sure you guys make automobiles but it is nothing in the grand scheme of things. They're kind of bespoke Jaguars and Aston Martins.\"\nTrump met Japanese officials on Wednesday morning.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves is expected in Washington next week for the IMF's spring meetings.\nBritain may have to wait for other deals to be finalised as the Trump administration tries to build a trade bloc against China's manufacturing might.\nSouth Korea's finance minister is due to meet Trump's treasury secretary next week.\nHowever, Britain comes with advantages that other nations cannot match, according to Vance, who noted that Britain and the US already enjoy a \"reciprocal relationship\".\nA British Government spokesman said negotiations with the US remain ongoing.",
