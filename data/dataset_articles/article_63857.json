  "text": "Fittingly, the Empire Theatre—a venue known for entertainment—lived up to its name, as both the federal candidates and an engaged audience brought energy and unexpected moments to the local stage turned political stage.\nThe Belleville Chamber of Commerce, in partnership with the Central Lakes Association of Realtors, hosted a federal candidates’ debate for the Bay of Quinte riding at the downtown Belleville theatre on April 15. Candidates included Conservative incumbent Ryan Williams, Liberal Chris Malette, the Green Party’s Erica Charlton, and the NDP’s Kate Crothers. Chris Auger, president of the Belleville Chamber of Commerce, moderated the event.\nBefore the debate began, all questions were submitted online or to the Dropbox at the theatre. No questions were taken from the floor.\nThe audience was polite and celebratory when each candidate was introduced, except for one small group that stood and booed the Liberal candidate; they were quickly shushed by those around them. Auger warned that disruptive audience members could face expulsion.\nAfter the introductory statements, the debate began. Each candidate had a chance to be the first to answer a question. That candidate got two minutes to discuss the answer, followed by one-minute responses from the other candidates and a one-minute rebuttal from the initial responder. The questions were randomly drawn.\nRyan Williams was asked the first question about what a Conservative government would do to fix the housing crisis. He started by saying this issue is the biggest one faced by the Quinte region and Canada. “The biggest threat to home building is the people. We get in the way of housing construction and new starts.” He said the average housing construction project in Canada takes seven years. “Government, regulations and planning get in the way.\n“We’re going to make sure that we work with the provinces to eliminate a lot of the red tape that’s in the way, …But the bigger part is we’re going to cut tax on new home construction. We’re going to cut all the GST, which will save $64,000 for a new home, up to $1.3 million. That’s not just for first-time home buyers. That’s for any buyer. And what that does is it moves people, maybe out of their existing house, and more importantly, it frees up inventory.\n“But more importantly, we’re working on affordable market rent and making more transitional housing,” he said, citing examples like Shiloh House and All-together Housing.\nChris Malette agreed with Williams that these local transitional housing models were spot on and pointed out that he had already discussed with All-Together, how their projects would perfectly dovetail with the Liberal government’s “Build Canada Homes” (BCH) program, billed as “Canada’s most ambitious housing plan since the Second World War.”\nThe Green Party will work effectively with all levels of government, said Charlton. “We need federal funding to make affordable housing, and when we say it’s affordable, we need to guarantee it stays affordable. Housing should not be more than 30 per cent of your income.” She said there should be a “covenant” to ensure the housing stays affordable, “to close loopholes and eliminate tax advantages for corporations, and we need to stop corporations from buying houses in our market.”\nCrothers criticized big developers, who, she said, don’t build affordable housing because it isn’t profitable. “Rent control isn’t offered because billionaires want to stay rich.” She reminded the crowd that the Ford government in Ontario took away rent control, and now “people are struggling” to pay their bills. An NDP government would advocate for nationwide rent control and community housing, “for people like us who can’t afford a McMansion.”\nThe moderator next began with Mallette: “How will your party ensure that federal transfer payments to provinces result in equitable funding for rural communities like the Bay of Quinte, where the cost of delivering services often exceeds per capita models based on urban benchmarks?”\nMallette stressed the need for more assertive federal involvement in ensuring equitable funding for rural communities. “For instance, in healthcare spending, we send healthcare transfers to the province of Ontario. We know there was a $3 billion surplus, but they can’t explain where federal funding went that was earmarked for our hospitals and our waiting lists.” We need to have more. We need to have more, stronger, more enforced strings attached to those funding allowances.”\n“A Carney government,” he said, would be “more assertive with those provincial partners in making sure that the money we send from Ottawa gets purpose-built for infrastructure, especially… on things like what we greatly need in Belleville, sewage pumping stations. We have a $100 million refit of the wastewater treatment facility. It’s going to require huge dollars. We must see that those federal dollars are adequately supplied and properly applied.”\nThe Green candidate took an opportunity to silence the same small group of people who had booed and talked among themselves throughout her and other candidates’ speaking time: “Maybe I need to speak a little bit louder so you listen to me more. Is that what it is? ”\nTo cheers from the larger audience, she said, “We need accountability in our government,” then turned directly to Williams, “You just said that we have food insecurity. Why did you vote against a National School Food Program? You talk about crime rising. That’s the direct result of poverty. Then why are you voting against affordability acts that would actually work? Or a basic livable income so that we can survive this change in our dynamic [with the U.S.].” The room erupted in cheers.\nWilliams then took his turn to emphasize the need for accountability in government spending, arguing that taxpayers’ money had not been used wisely over the past decade. He highlighted issues such as increased government hiring (“140,000 extra employees”) while many struggled with food insecurity and affordability. “And the government’s solution, why we voted against it, it was for more bureaucracy, for more employees when we actually need more meal programs, for money to the programs that are already running here doing that job.”\nHe proposed a different approach: tying taxpayer dollars to tangible outcomes like building homes, adding hospital beds, and hiring doctors and nurses, rather than expanding the public service.\nCrothers called for accountability in government spending, citing projects in the region that went unfunded by the federal government, such as the redevelopment of the former Queen Elizabeth School site in Picton and Highway 49, “one of the worst highways in Ontario, maybe Canada, and that responsibility has been downloaded onto the community. The federal funding has not come yet, so it would be up to us to enforce that, to work with the federal government and the provincial government and communities to make that happen.”\nGiven the opportunity to respond, Malette said, “Well, we’re hearing about a need for a different approach to government and relations with the provinces, all the way down to the municipalities. But the Carney government is talking about a bold new fiscal approach that doesn’t gut the social services millions of us depend on. Daycare? That’ll stay. Pharmacare? Secure. Dental care? Still here. No slashing and burning of what keeps us going, just smarter ways to fund it. We’re not talking about fixing up the old place by adding a few boards on the fence and slapping a fresh coat of paint on the doors. We’re building a new house with a smart, savvy, bold architect and builder, and we’re going to change things in Ottawa starting today.”\nA perhaps unexpectedly passionate audience reaction moment came when candidates were asked how their government would improve media literacy, with the abundance of misinformation on social media, and what source they would recommend to ensure accurate, unbiased news. An audience member yelled, “CBC!”\n“Thank you for the prompt,” laughed Malette, “I’m going to go right to it. Our Conservative friends would like nothing better than to skewer the CBC.” Many audience members booed. “They want to defund it, put it to the scrap heap. Somebody better tell Casey and Finnigan because that is not a good idea. A new Liberal plan to protect our Canadian identity will actually strengthen the CBC and Radio Canada.” Cheers again with one man loudly booing, “Protecting our identity is critical to keeping Canada strong… We’ll stand up to protect [the CBC].\n“We’re going to develop a governance plan for CBC and Radio Canada to improve accountability, empower leadership, streamline processes, and tap into the institution’s innovative spirit. Don’t tell me that the CBC is a government puppet agency. Listen, I was in the business long enough; I know it’s not a valuable asset to our country,” the former journalist said as cheers erupted.\nThe Green candidate agreed and went further, saying the CBC is a vital unifier.\n“Our varying regions make it hard for us to agree on many things, because our experience is a lot different from region to region. The CBC unites us. We all benefit from it. If you are going to defund CBC what other place will you get both official languages and eleven and indigenous languages? …. And if you’re going to take that away from us, you’re going to take away part of Canada’s heart, especially in the darkest of times with the crises right now.”\nWilliams said he would set the record straight, “No one’s getting rid of the CBC. We’re getting rid of the government bloat, which is the CBC.”\nThe audience jeered.\nWilliams said the CBC generates $681 million a year in revenue and subscriptions, and “on top of that it gets $1.2 billion of government spending at a time when we have people going hungry and people going homeless.” He claimed a Conservative government would not eliminate CBC but “ensure that CBC can operate efficiently and ensure that their $681 million can bring that back to a more efficient statement. We’re not getting rid of CBC Canada.”\n“But the other thing we’re going to do is to ensure local [news outlets] can put their event on Facebook or Meta or on IG, they’re going to be able to get that back, because we’re going to reverse that.”\nThat sparked a mixed, loud outburst from the audience, and the moderator warned them to temper their reactions.\nThe Chamber of Commerce’s YouTube channel will post the whole event in the coming days.
