(hereinafter referred to as \"Huayan Robotics\").\nOn March 28, Hans Robot released an official announcement letter across its official social medias\nannouncing the name change, explaining that the rebranding marks the beginning of its “next phase of global expansion.” The letter also emphasized that Huayan Robotics will fully assume all existing contractual obligations, orders, and after-sales services previously held under Shenzhen Han's Robot Co., Ltd. The company assured that the name change will have no adverse impact on its partners or customers. Commenting on the rebrand, Huayan Robotics (formerly Han’s Robot) CEO Wang Guangneng stated: “The new name reflects a comprehensive upgrade of our brand and services. Yet, Huayan Robotics remains unwavering in its commitment to advancing the development and global industrial application of high-end collaborative robot.”\nThe name “Huayan Robotics” embodies the spirit of “Leading in the Era of robotics, Scaling Peaks of Technology”, clearly reflecting the company’s ambition to compete at the highest level in the global collaborative robots arena and to establish a new international benchmark in intelligent manufacturing.\nHans Robot is a global leader in collaborative robots, integrating R&D, manufacturing, and sales.
