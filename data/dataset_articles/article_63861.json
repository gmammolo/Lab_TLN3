Ackman's Pershing Square held over 12.7 million shares in the company at the end of the fourth quarter, a roughly 4% stake. Even with Wednesday’s gains, shares are down about 11% over the past 12 months. Hertz ( HTZ ) shares soared 56% to close at $5.71 Wednesday after billionaire Bill Ackman’s investment firm Pershing Square disclosed a sizable stake in the struggling rental car company.\nPershing Square held over 12.7 million shares in the company at the end of the fourth quarter, a roughly 4% stake, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. Hertz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nHertz reported a loss of $2.86 billion in 2024 as the company took a hit from vehicle depreciation and the fallout from its unsuccessful efforts to switch its fleet to electric vehicles, among other things. The company’s stock lost close to two-thirds of its value in 2024.\nEven with Wednesday’s gains, shares are down about 11% over the past 12 months.\nSeparately, Hertz on Wednesday announced a partnership with UVeye, a move the company said will “introduce advanced AI inspection to its U.S. operations.”\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?
