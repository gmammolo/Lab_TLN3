  "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Charlotte city leaders are weighing a series of affordable housing projects that could bring hundreds of new units to the Queen City, funded by a $100 million housing bond approved by voters last November.\nAt a meeting Monday night, city staff recommended approval for 13 proposed projects across Charlotte aimed at addressing the city’s growing need for affordable housing.\n“There’s a significant need, and it’s growing,” Kaedon Grinnell, chief program officer at Roof Above , said. “Good affordable housing creates spaces where folks are not experiencing financial burden but are also connected to social supports that allow them to thrive.”\nRoof Above is a nonprofit working to combat homelessness in Charlotte.\nOne such project is Barton South, a 140-unit affordable housing development planned along the Blue Line Extension. Located just half a mile from two grocery stores, the site is designed to provide easy access to transportation and essential services.\nHowever, not every proposal received a green light. City staff did not recommend moving forward at this time with the Brooklyn Village redevelopment, which included a $13.5 million request — the largest in the history of the Housing Trust Fund.\nStaff recommended deferring that project while alternative funding structures are explored. The proposal is expected to return to the city council in June.\nMark Jerrell, chair of the Mecklenburg County Commission, expressed both support for the project and concern about potential delays.\n“I think this is the way we should engage with folks that are asking for public dollars,” Jerrell said. “But we also know this is one of the biggest opportunities we have as it relates to affordable housing. So in those terms, we want to make sure we are producing the best deal for the community, and so I certainly respect moving in a cautious manner, we just don’t want to let the caution impede progress.”\nCity Council is expected to vote on the recommended projects on April 28.\nContact Walker Lawson at wlawson@wcnc.com or follow him on Facebook , X , Instagram and TikTok .\nClose Ad",
