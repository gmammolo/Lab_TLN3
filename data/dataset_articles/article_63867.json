  "text": "{p}MOBILE, Ala. — The Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) is pressing ahead with the Mobile Bayway project, despite ending negotiations with Mobile Bayway Constructors last month. ALDOT has initiated talks with the Kiewit Massman and Traylor team, which has already committed to providing design and construction services for the Mobile River Bridge portion of the project.{/p}{p}Project Director Edwin Perry said, \"Those two will come to form our guaranteed max price, which will be what we'll use to award the contract, and the price we'll be able to use to finish the financing for the project. Again, that all happens this year, and we'll issue the notice to proceed by the end of this year and start construction activities.\"{/p}{p}ALDOT is on track to receive a price proposal by mid-2025 and another proposal for the remainder of the project toward the end of fall. The department remains optimistic that groundbreaking will occur before the end of 2025.{/p}\",\"readAloud\":null,\"isReadAloudChecked\":true,\"derivedImages\":{\"externalId\":\"247751cb-9393-4e6b-b074-e8f0cd35d8a2\",\"heroImageFromPackageMedia\":{\"type\":\"Image\",\"uuid\":\"a72cf5e6-3ca2-4875-b1e7-d7e11739bec2\",\"title\":\"ALDOT
