  "text": "AMERICANS can score up to $48,000 from a massive $92.5 million lawsuit settlement. The compensation comes from New York City after claims that plaintiffs were held in custody longer than legally allowed. Anyone who was detained by the New York City Department of Correction past their scheduled release date may be able to cash in from the settlement. The lawsuit covers people held past their scheduled release between April 1, 1997, and December 21, 2012, solely due to ICE detainer requests. ICE - Immigration and Customs Enforcement - enforces immigration laws and handles the detention and removal of individuals in the US. If all other conditions for release were met - yet you were held solely due to an ICE detainer - you may be entitled to compensation. Several requirements must be fulfilled to be eligible to get a portion of the funds. The settlement identifies two main groups: the Statute of Limitations Group and the Recent Group. The Statute of Limitations Group includes those detained past release from April 1, 1997, to January 31, 2007. The Recent Group includes those detained past release between February 1, 2007, and December 21, 2012. According to the class action lawsuit, the Department of Correction allegedly detained individuals longer than legally allowed based solely on ICE detainer requests. The New York City Department of Correction oversees the city's prisons and rehabilitation programs. Plaintiffs say that, based on ICE’s own guidelines, the department only had the authority to hold someone for up to 48 hours due to an ICE detainer - but often exceeded that time limit. Although New York City denies any wrongdoing, it has agreed to the $92.5 million settlement to resolve the allegations. Exact payouts will vary depending on how many days a person was unlawfully held and how many people submit valid claims. According to the settlement website, Recent Group members may get between $20,000 and $48,000 on average. Statute of Limitations Group members are expected to get between $10,000 and $24,000 on average. The deadline to request exclusion from or object to the settlement is May 15, 2025. The final court hearing to approve the settlement is October 6, 2025. To receive compensation, you must submit a valid claim form by May 15, 2025.",
