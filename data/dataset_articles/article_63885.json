  "text": "DORAL, Fla. – Miami-Dade Sheriff Rosie Cordero-Stutz on Wednesday marked her 100th day in office by outlining key accomplishments and laying out her vision for the future of the newly reestablished sheriff’s office.\nLeer en español\nCordero-Stutz, the first elected sheriff in the county in more than six decades, took office in January after voters approved a constitutional amendment to restore the position.\nDuring a news conference at the sheriff’s headquarters in Doral, she said her administration is focused on four key pillars: rooting out corruption, reducing crime, improving transparency and accountability and strengthening officer training.\n“These first 100 days have been intense, yet rewarding,” Cordero-Stutz said.\nShe highlighted several accomplishments, including the arrest of multiple county employees accused of extortion schemes.\nCordero-Stutz credited those arrests to her office’s collaboration with the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office.\nShe also pointed to a drop in violent crime, reporting a 22% decrease in murders in unincorporated Miami-Dade compared to the same period in 2024.\n“The homicide bureau has successfully closed 20 murders — 66% improvement over the same time the previous year,” she said.\nCordero-Stutz said training remains a cornerstone of her administration’s strategy.\n“Training allows us to elevate our standards,” she said. “From new cadets entering the academy to ongoing training for deputies and our command staff.”\nShe also announced plans for future enforcement efforts, including a countywide crackdown on the illegal use of handicap placards.\nOther upcoming initiatives include boosting the presence of deputies at houses of worship and combating cyber scams targeting Miami-Dade residents.\nCopyright 2025 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.",
