  "text": "BIDs in Brownsville, Brooklyn; Sunnyside, Queens; and the Bronx Capitol District published Vision Plans for the future of their public spaces, after 12 months of community engagement and collaboration with designers. The Vision Plans from Pitkin Avenue BID, Sunnyside Shines BID, and 161st Street BID lay out a blueprint for how to reimagine public spaces in their commercial corridors through installations, programming, and capital improvements. The BIDs received funding, technical assistance, and consultation with city agencies through the Local Center, a partnership between Urban Design Forum and the Association for Neighborhood & Housing Development (“ANHD”).\nThe BIDs worked with teams of designers to construct creative improvements to their public spaces to drive foot traffic and strengthen neighborhood connectivity and safety. They engaged 100+ residents, small businesses, and community stakeholders in each neighborhood to understand local priorities for public space. The teams tested those ideas in Summer and Fall 2024 through short-term activations like lighting installations, night markets, and shading structures in plazas and parks. These and other ideas are captured in the BIDs’ Vision Plans.\nThe plans include short- and long-term strategies for transforming the districts’ public spaces to reflect the identities and priorities of local businesses, artists, and residents. Each BID will work with community stakeholders and city agencies to advocate for additional investment and support to advance these strategies in 2025 and beyond.\nBy directing more investment into comprehensive vision planning and lively public spaces in under-invested commercial corridors, this initiative helps further the New York Governor and New York City Mayor’s “New” New York Action Plan to reinvigorate New York City’s business districts and amplify cultural and economic vibrancy in public spaces across the boroughs.\nSunnyside Shines Business Improvement District, serving Sunnyside, Queens, worked with di Domenico + Partners and the Queens Lighting Collective to produce the Sunnyside Vision Plan focused on transforming underutilized areas, including the plazas and parking bays underneath the 7 train and Sabba Park, into vibrant spaces that reflect the neighborhood’s diverse communities, encourage community interaction, and stimulate local businesses. In 2025, the BID will advance vision plan ideas for night markets and performance space in Lowery Plaza and a new lighting installation on Greenpoint Avenue.\n“This was a wonderful opportunity to reconceptualize the use of our public spaces in Sunnyside and have structured conversations on how to improve the spaces and maximize their use by the community,” said Dirk McCall de Palomá, Executive Director of Sunnyside Shines BID. “We are incredibly grateful to the Urban Design Forum, ANHD, and all of their funders, especially the NYC Department of Small Business Services (SBS) for teaming us up with a design firm and a lighting firm to embark upon this process together. It was incredibly helpful and will result in improvements to our public spaces and have deepened our connections to our local community.”",
