  "text": "- Liberty Energy (\nLBRT,Financial) reported Q1 2025 revenue of $977 million, a 4% sequential increase. - Net income for the quarter was $20 million, translating to $0.12 EPS.\n- Adjusted EBITDA rose 8% sequentially to $168 million.\nLiberty Energy Inc. (LBRT) has announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2025, showcasing a revenue increase to $977 million, up 4% from the previous quarter but down from $1.1 billion in Q1 2024. Despite market challenges, the company's Adjusted EBITDA also rose by 8% sequentially to $168 million.\nThe company's net income for Q1 2025 was $20 million, or $0.12 per fully diluted share, showing a decline from $82 million in Q1 2024. This shift is attributed to margin pressures even as overall revenue and operational metrics showed sequential growth.\nLiberty Energy displayed strategic movements in its operations by acquiring IMG Energy Solutions to expand its footprint into distributed power systems. The company also successfully tested the industry's first natural gas variable speed pump with digiPrime technology, enhancing its technological edge.\nThe company returned $37 million to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, retiring 1.0% of shares during Q1 2025. Since the repurchase program's reinstatement in July 2022, Liberty has cumulatively retired 15.9% of its outstanding shares, emphasizing its commitment to shareholder value.\nAs of March 31, 2025, Liberty Energy reported a strong balance sheet with $24 million in cash and $164 million in total liquidity, providing a buffer against market volatility. The management anticipates sequential growth in revenue and profitability for Q2 2025, bolstered by higher fleet utilization and robust demand for services despite tariff pressures and OPEC+ strategies.\nLiberty Energy continues to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share, reflecting its stable capital return strategy. The company also remains proactive in mitigating tariff-related impacts and strengthening its position through technological advancements and market diversification.",
