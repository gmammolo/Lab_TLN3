  "text": "- Revenue increased 7% sequentially to $710 million.\n- MRC Global's (\nMRC,Financial) US backlog has grown over 20% since start of 2025. - Company announces $125 million share repurchase program to commence in Q2 2025.\nMRC Global Inc. (MRC) has released its preliminary first quarter 2025 financial results, reporting a revenue of approximately $710 million, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter. The company recorded a net income of about $7 million, with Adjusted EBITDA at $35 million, representing 4.9% of sales.\nThe growth was primarily driven by the US segment, which saw notable sector increases: 13% in Downstream, Industrial & Energy Transition (DIET), 8% in Gas Utilities, and 6% in Production & Transmission Infrastructure (PTI). The US backlog has expanded by more than 20% since January 2025, a strong indicator for future revenue prospects.\nLooking ahead, MRC Global anticipates a high-single to low-double digit percentage increase in sequential sales for Q2 2025. In response to recent share price volatility, the company plans to launch a $125 million share repurchase program in the second quarter, indicating management's confidence in the company's valuation and future performance.",
