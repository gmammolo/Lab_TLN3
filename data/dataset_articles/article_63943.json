  "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Virginia, joined several congressional members in a letter urging U.S. House leadership to protect Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations. The letter states that balancing the federal budget should not come at the expense of children, seniors, those with disabilities and pregnant women. “Our constituents are asking for changes to the healthcare system that will strengthen the healthcare workforce, offer low-income, working-class families expanded opportunities to save for medical expenses, support rural and underserved communities, and help new mothers,\" the letter states. Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a budget that seeks at least $1.5 trillion in cuts to federal programs and services. The budget still must pass through the Senate, and it's unclear what potential specific cuts will be. RELATED: Virginia physicians call on representatives to preserve Medicaid in national budget The letter states that Medicaid cuts would threaten the viability of hospitals and nursing homes. Healthcare providers in rural and underserved areas often rely heavily on Medicaid. \"Providers in these areas are especially at risk of closure, with many unable to recover. When hospitals close, it affects all constituents, regardless of healthcare coverage,\" the letter states. On Tuesday, the Committee to Protect Health Care held a call with three Virginia physicians who implored their representatives to ensure Medicaid is protected in the proposed budget. One of those state leaders is Rep. Wittman. Wittman's Tuesday statement read in part: \"No one has proposed or voted on cuts to Medicaid. Medicaid is an indispensable lifeline for our nation’s most vulnerable, including people with disabilities, seniors, and expectant mothers. That’s why we must act now to strengthen the program.\"",
