  "text": "TN legislature passes new nearly $60 billion budget\nThe House and Senate passed a $59.8 billion budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year.\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - The Tennessee General Assembly announced it has passed the state’s nearly $60 billion budget on Wednesday.\nThe House and Senate passed a $59.8 billion budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year.\nThe new spending plan shows a 2% growth rate with efforts to improve public safety, invest in infrastructure, advance education, and more, according to Republican legislators.\n“The legislative amendment makes fiscally responsible adjustments to the administration’s initial budget proposal by shifting $19.94 million in recurring allocations to non-recurring, allowing the state to better manage long-term spending obligations,” Republicans said.\nBelow is a look at the budget breakdown from state Republicans:\nGrant Pool for Community Services\nIn the budget, a $42.5 million grant pool was created, with nonrecurring funds, for important emergency and community services. The grants include:\n- $20 million for Volunteer Fire Departments\n- $5 million for Rescue Squads\n- $5 million for Emergency Medical Services\n- $5 million for Senior Centers\n- $5 million for Local Museums for capital improvements\n- $2 million for Courthouse Restoration\n- $500,000 for Second Harvest Food Bank\nDisaster Relief for Hurricane Helene\nHurricane Helene victims were provided $26 million nonrecurring for disaster relief in Northeast Tennessee and $20 million nonrecurring for local match funds for FEMA disaster relief.\nRural Hospital Support and Healthcare Investments\nLawmakers used TennCare Shared Savings to provide an additional $78 million to help hospitals, particularly in rural areas, with uncompensated care and $4 million to complete capital projects at county health departments.\nAdditional healthcare investments include:\n- $4 million recurring to increase pediatric dental rates\n- $3 million nonrecurring to the Adult Healthcare Safety Net\n- $500,000 nonrecurring to assist those living with epilepsy and their caregivers statewide\n- $1.4 million recurring to provide scholarships for the joint public-private partnership in the Medical School Early Acceptance Program between MTSU and Meharry Medical College\n- $1 million nonrecurring to Live Like Lou Foundation for ALS research\n- $1 million nonrecurring for Volunteers in Medicine\nSafety and Security Improvements\nThe budget also provides additional allocations in safety and security:\n- $5.4 million nonrecurring to improve campus safety and security at the University of Memphis\n- $500,000 nonrecurring to establish and operate the UT Law Enforcement Innovation Center\n- $400,000 nonrecurring to support the East Tennessee Regional Forensic Facility and Training Program\nMajor investments secured\nIn addition to the adjustments made to fund legislative priorities, the budget maintains investments proposed by Gov. Lee including:\n- $1 billion into the road fund to address the state’s transportation infrastructure needs\n- $62.7 million for K-12 infrastructure and facilities funding\n- $244 million to strengthen education through the Tennessee Investment in Student Achievement (TISA) formula growth, including teacher pay raises\n- $198.4 million for teacher bonuses in recognition of their hard work and dedication and for leading the nation in student achievement and growth\n- $35.6 million investment into the Rainy Day Fund, bringing Tennessee’s reserves to nearly $2.2 billion, the largest in state history\n- $25 million for FastTrack grants to recruit new business to Tennessee and support workforce development\nExpanding choices for parents\nThe special session-passed school choice bill initiative invests $145.9 million in Education Freedom Scholarships.\nWSMV4 has reached out to state democrats for a response to the budget. We have yet to hear back by the time of this article’s publishing.\nCopyright 2025 WSMV. All rights reserved.",
