  "text": "Arsenal are through to the semifinals of the UEFA Champions League (UCL), beating holders Real Madrid 5-1 on aggregate in their quarterfinal match to advance on Wednesday night.\nThe Gunners were too much for Real Madrid, as they secured a 2-1 win at the Santiago Bernabeu in their second match on Wednesday to reach the semifinals with a 5-1 aggregate win.\nWednesday’s quarterfinal burst into action after a pair of first-half penalty decisions. Bukayo Saka’s penalty was easily saved by Thibaut Courtois, while Madrid’s renewed optimism was dented minutes later after a penalty call of their own was overturned by the referee after a long VAR review.\nArsenal stymied Madrid’s attack in the second half before Saka made amends for his penalty miss with the game’s first goal. But a mistake by William Saliba immediately after led to Vinicius Junior scoring for the reigning European champions.\nGabriel Martinelli scored in injury time to cap off a memorable night for Arsenal and set up a date with Paris Saint-Germain in the team’s first semifinal appearance since 2009.",
