  "text": "DECATUR, Ala. (WHNT) — A Decatur historical marker commemorating African American Heritage has been replaced after it was damaged last month.\nThe African American Heritage marker in Old Town Decatur has been replaced after it was damaged on March 24.\nThe marker chronicles the forgotten contributions of African Americans to the City of Decatur, going back to before the city was incorporated.\nEstablished in 1821, Old Town was the home of many prominent African Americans and black-owned businesses before Urban Renewal took over in the 1970s. Decatur was incorporated in 1826.\nA spokesperson for the Decatur Preservation originally said it would take a year to get a new marker and the replacement would likely cost thousands.\nHistorian Peggy Towns, who helped get the original marker placed, thanked Decatur Mayor Tab Bowling for helping get the marker quickly replaced.\nThe mayor told News 19’s Archie Snowden that he simply knew the right person to call for help.\n“Nothing beats having reliable friends,” Bowling said. “When I learned about this unfortunate incident, I knew which friend to call.”\nDecatur Police said last month they were investigating what caused the damage to the marker but had not determined if it had been damaged intentionally or accidentally.\nAuthorities said on Tuesday that there were no updates in that investigation.\nThe post Deactur historical marker replaced after damage appeared first on WHNT .",
