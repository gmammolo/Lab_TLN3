  "text": "ST. JOHNS COUNTY, Fla. – Signs of the First Coast Expressway began popping up in St. Johns County as the next phase of the project takes shape.\nResidents said they are already noticing the changes, and the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) provided updates on what to expect.\nRecommended Videos\nChristi Alvarez, a resident of Shearwater, moved to the area two years ago, not far from Trout Creek Academy. She recalled the moment she first heard the construction noise.\n“It was a total surprise,” she said.\nRELATED | FDOT unveils plans for next phase of First Coast Expressway construction in St. Johns County\nAround the southern part of the neighborhood, clearings and columns are visible, marking significant progress for FDOT.\nThe First Coast Expressway will eventually connect Interstate 10 to Interstate 95, providing direct access for residents on the Westside, as well as those in Clay and St. Johns counties.\nClick here to view an interactive map of the project\nThis segment of the expressway, which runs east of County Road 16A to just east of St. Johns Parkway through the Silverleaf neighborhood, is estimated to cost $242 million.\nThis segment of the First Coast Expressway, which runs east of County Road 16A to just east of St. Johns Parkway through the Silverleaf neighborhood, is estimated to cost $242 million. (FDOT) Sara Pleasants from FDOT explained what residents can expect in the coming months.\n“They will see some overpasses being built, with the piles for those, and then just new roadway construction, laying asphalt, curb and gutter, that kind of thing,” she said.\nJust a short drive from a local Jersey Mike’s near Silver Leaf, some shoppers mentioned they have begun noticing the changes brought by the expressway.\nMORE | Traffic relief in sight for Clay County commuters as First Coast Expressway project progresses\nPleasants went on to explain long-term project plans.\n“This is a multi-year project. They started last fall on this segment, and it’ll continue, likely until around 2030. Later this year, we expect to see construction start on that final segment, which will be east of County Road 2209, from St. Johns Parkway to I-95,” Pleasants added.\nDespite the noise and disruption, Alvarez sees the value in what’s coming.\n“Shearwater is wonderful. I often say it’s kind of like a 55-and-over community for young families,” she said, highlighting the appeal of her neighborhood.\nPleasants explained some of the louder noise of the pile driving should be done in the next couple of weeks.\nAs construction progresses, the First Coast Expressway promises to enhance connectivity and accessibility for residents, paving the way for future growth in the region.\nCopyright 2025 by WJXT News4JAX - All rights reserved.",
