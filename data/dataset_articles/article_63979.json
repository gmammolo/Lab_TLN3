  "text": "Local Community Howell, Michigan breaks ground on new social district By Elle Meyers April 16, 2025 / 5:57 PM EDT / CBS Detroit\nConstruction to begin on new social district in Howell, Michigan Construction to begin on new social district in Howell, Michigan 01:26 An empty lot won't be empty for long after the city of Howell, Michigan, broke ground Wednesday on its new social district in the downtown area.\nThe estimated $13 million project will feature an ice skating rink, pavilion and gathering space.\n\"It's, you know, the culmination of not just three years but many years of planning and advocacy,\" said Howell Mayor Bob Ellis.\nEllis said the hope is to provide residents and visitors with a space away from home, work, or school.\n\"What really makes a community is these third places besides home and work or school if you're younger-- and that really builds a cohesive community where people feel like they're part of something,\" said Ellis.\nCharles Gleeson III with C.E. Gleeson Constructors said he feels that these types of projects are special.\n\"You're just dealing with the true residents of the city, the people that really get to go in and enjoy these with their families, and you kind of get to touch their hearts a little bit more than with a standard commercial project,\" Gleeson said.\nThe space isn't currently designated for alcohol consumption, but Howell's existing social district does border the new gathering space.\n\"It'll only take one council meeting to expand that,\" Ellis said.\nIn: Howell Community Construction Michigan Elle Meyers Elle Meyers joined the CBS News Detroit team in April of 2023 after spending two years covering Michigan's capitol. Elle is an Oregon native and a graduate of the University of Oregon (go Ducks!), where she double majored in journalism and political science, both of which have served her well in her journey to Detroit.\nTwitter Facebook Instagram © 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
