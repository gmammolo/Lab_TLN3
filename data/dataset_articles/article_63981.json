  "text": "Declan Rice reflects on 'special night' as Arsenal defeat Real Madrid to advance in Champions League\nThere would be no Remontada for Real Madrid on Wednesday as they fell 2-1 to visiting Arsenal in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie, giving the Premier League side a 5-1 aggregate victory after their three-goal victory last week.\nIt was a deserved victory for the Gunners, who once again showed no fear of the Spanish giants and were full value for the result, with goals by Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli sealing the London side's place in the semi-finals.\nFor first leg hero Declan Rice, who was immense again on Wednesday, winning at the Santiago Bernabeu was just deserts for the club as they continue on towards their goal of claiming their first Champions League title.\n\"It is such a special night for this club, a historic night for this club,\" Rice told TNT Sports. \"We had an objective in this competition - we want to win this competition.\n\"We had so much belief and confidence that we had enough to come here and win the game.\n\"We had it in our mind and we have done it in real life. What a night for the club.\"\nAmid another campaign in which the Gunners appear headed for a second-place finish in the Premier League — which would be their third runners-up finish in three years — the potential of reaching the top of the mountain in Europe's most glamourous competition is something worth striving for, Rice said.\n\"It is massive,\" he added. \"I sensed it before I turned up to the club that we were on an upward trajectory.\n\"In this competition, we have done amazingly well. We fully believe it and we have full trust in the manager - he is unbelievable.\n\"Semi-final, it is massive for us and we want to take tonight in.\"\nWatch the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup live on DAZN\nSign up for a free DAZN account now to watch the Club World Cup starting on Saturday, June 14.\nOr, if you are already a DAZN subscriber or Freemium member, then the draw is part of your current membership.\nA DAZN Freemium account costs nothing and provides access to action across football, boxing, NFL, golf, darts, motorsports, basketball and padel.\nThis includes the UEFA Women's Champions League, NFL , LIV Golf, Super League Basketball and Saudi Pro League, plus other weekly specially selected games, leagues, sports and highlights.\nFree TV Channels include Matchroom Boxing, PGA Tour, PowerSports World, Billiard TV and Padel Time TV.\nYou only need an email address to register for a Freemium account, with no hidden costs or fees.\nJoin us now to start watching sport for free on DAZN, sign up here .\n*Sports and channels dependent on country of residence",
