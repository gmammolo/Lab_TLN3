  "text": "Peter Dutton wants more high schoolers to adopt trades. (ABC News: John Gunn)A Dutton government would establish a dozen technical colleges for high schoolers to learn trades and other vocational skills, reviving a Howard-era idea on a smaller scale.The colleges, with at least one in each state, will offer a hybrid of apprenticeships and traineeships and academic courses to students from years 10 to 12, operated in partnership with private companies and not-for-profits with $260 million in federal funding.\\\"I want to see more young Australians learn a trade, build a great career and contribute to our national success,\\\" Mr Dutton said.\\\"Not enough students are taking up the skills we need to solve the urgent national challenges we face.\\\"Sussan Ley, the Coalition\\'s skills spokesperson, told the ABC some of the colleges would use existing facilities, and that the school system was too heavily geared towards university attendance.\\\"We have always rejected the idea that if you haven\\'t made it to university then you haven\\'t made it in life, and that principle underpins this announcement,\\\" she said.Howard-era idea abolished by Rudd, contemplated by AbbottThe Howard government established two dozen technical colleges in 2005 and had promised as many as 100, but funding was removed by the Rudd government, which deemed them outdated given the growth of the TAFE sector. All but a few closed.Tony Abbott promised a revival as opposition leader in the 2010 election, but did not carry this through when elected in 2013.The Coalition is opposed to Labor\\'s multi-billion-dollar push for permanent full-fee TAFE subsidies and has confirmed it will repeal them, arguing it is poorly targeted and promising an alternative skills program of its own.Speaking at a vocational institution in Alice Springs on Tuesday, Labor\\'s skills minister Andrew Giles said fee-free TAFE had been a \\\"runaway success\\\" and had boosted enrolments\\\" and said the opposition would be \\\"slamming shut the door of opportunity\\\" on TAFE students if it proceeded with a repeal.Whichever alternative prevails after the election, the low take-up and completion rates of apprenticeships will remain a significant contributing factor to labour shortages in the construction sector, a key barrier to building more housing.Both parties have ambitions to boost housing supply but have each acknowledged the migration system may also need to be better utilised to fill the shortage, with Mr Dutton promising to prioritise trades on the skills list.",
