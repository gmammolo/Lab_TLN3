  "text": "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes recently issued an injunction against President Donald Trump’s ban on transgender service members, claiming that the ban violates constitutional rights. Reyes paused her ruling to provide the administration time to appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice Department lawyers claimed that President Trump can dictate military personnel eligibility, but Reyes countered that his authority should not infringe on the rights of marginalized individuals. Reyes wrote, “The ban is soaked in animus and dripping with pretext. Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.” Reyes added, “Indeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed – some risking their lives – to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them.” The legal challenge came from active-duty transgender service members and individuals hoping to enlist, who argued they would face discrimination under the policy. Reyes noted that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claims against the ban. She found that the Trump administration failed to justify the broad exclusion of all transgender troops. The administration had directed the Pentagon to declare transgender individuals incompatible with military service, asserting that the ban is necessary for military effectiveness. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller wrote, “District court judges have now decided they are in command of the Armed Forces…is there no end to this madness?” The guidance issued by the Pentagon shortly before Reyes’ ruling stated that service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria would be processed for separation and classified by biological sex. Reyes’ ruling echoes a similar ban from 2017 that faced multiple legal challenges, which temporarily blocked its implementation. The Supreme Court allowed the ban to take effect in 2019 but did not rule on its constitutionality. Approximately 4,200 active-duty, reserve, and National Guard members have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Reyes stated, “At times, however, leaders have used concern for military readiness to deny marginalized persons. First minorities, then women in combat, then gays filled in that blank.” John Baker covers U.S. politics & news for content partner Modern Newsstand LLC.",
