  "text": "Oshkosh distinguished alumni honored in ceremony\nOSHKOSH, Wis. (WBAY) - A special ceremony was held Wednesday to honor distinguished alumni of the Oshkosh Area School District.\nJanette Fennell graduated from Oshkosh West in 1972 and is the founder and president of Kids and Car Safety.\nHer advocacy has led to numerous advancements in safety features, including trunk release mechanisms, which she developed after a traumatic experience in 1995 when she and her family were kidnapped and locked in the trunk of their car.\nNot one person has died since the implementation of the trunk release mechanism in 2002.\n“We work to save kids’ lives, you don’t think about awards for doing that type of work, you just think about saving lives, so this is a nice little whipped cream on top of the sundae,” said Fennell.\nTo learn more about her organization you can go to https://www.kidsandcars.org/.\nCopyright 2025 WBAY.
