(WBAY) - The Green Bay City Council approves a proposed development across the street from Red Smith K-8 School.\nThat means more houses, duplexes, and apartments are coming to the area, as well as commercial space.\nThis comes despite concerns about too many people moving into the neighborhood and the ecological impact it could have on the area.\nCopyright 2025 WBAY.
