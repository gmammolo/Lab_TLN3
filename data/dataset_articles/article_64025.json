  "text": "Lincoln honors 911 call center workers amid nationwide shortage\nLINCOLN, Neb. (KOLN) - In the midst of a national staffing shortage at 911 call centers, the City of Lincoln said it’s also in need of more telecommunications workers, taking this week to honor what they do.\nAt the new Lincoln Emergency Communications 911 Center on Wednesday, city officials gathered to share about the important work done by dispatchers, calling them a central link between the public and first responders.\nMayor Leirion Gaylor Baird also signed a proclamation marking this as National Public Safety Telecommunicator Week in Lincoln.\nJessica Loos, the center’s director, said there’s currently 14 openings for call takers, as well as other roles that haven’t been filled in more than a decade.\nShe adds the center still meets its minimum staffing numbers for each shift, but occasionally she has to mandate overtime or call in workers to meet that standard.\n“I don’t know that there’s a better center you can start your career in with 911,” she said. “While we have openings, I’m very confident we’re going to find the individuals that belong here.”\nLoos said that those mandates are no secret, and it’s something she tries to be upfront about when hiring new staff.\nThe LECC also offers a training academy to prepare workers for the half a million calls the center fields every year.\n“Not a job for anybody,” Loos said. “We don’t just want somebody picking up your call just to answer your call, we want somebody that’s committed to doing the right thing, getting you the right resource.”\nEmma Gettemy, who’s worked for the center twice now, said every day is different. And while it can be stressful, she takes pride in making Lincoln a safer place.\n“You have to have the passion for it, and that really helps you build resilience,” Gettemy said. “We cover for each other, we support each other. I know it’s hard for us to always get the days and times off, but we’re here cause we love it and we love helping the Lincoln community.”\nClick here to subscribe to our 10/11 NOW daily digest and breaking news alerts delivered straight to your email inbox.\nCopyright 2025 KOLN.
