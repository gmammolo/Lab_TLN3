  "text": "'We might have an Ireland manager there' — Brady tips Duff in top job\nLiam Brady has tipped his fellow Ireland legend Damien Duff to manage the national team one day.\nAlthough Brady believes Heimir Hallgrímsson has a chance of leading Ireland into the playoffs for next year’s World Cup, Duff is one he can foresee taking the reins.\nBrady worked with Duff when he was assistant to Giovanni Trapattoni, the trio part of the Ireland unit that pushed France in the playoff for the 2010 World Cup.\nFor someone who seems so averse to managing in his playing career, Duff has revelled in the migration, guiding Shelbourne to their first title in 18 years in only his third season as a senior boss.\nChampions League exposure awaits the 46-year-old in the summer and former Arsenal playmaker Brady has been observing his burgeoning managerial career thrive from afar.\n“Damien was always serious about his football, a very good trainer,” Brady recalls over their two years together in the Ireland camp.\n“I can see he’s a hard task master with his players. He demanded that of himself really. We might have an Ireland manager there for the future.\n“I think Damien’s learning now. He’s going to learn in the Champions League too, that's another string to his bow.” Ireland head into the June friendlies against Senegal and Luxembourg having preserved their place in the second tier of next year’s Uefa Nations League.\nA couple of 2-1 victories over Bulgaria in March brought encouragement to Brady about the qualifiers beginning in September.\nIreland take on Portugal, Hungary and Armenia, with 72-times capped Brady fancying their prospects of being in the mix to reach the showpiece next year co-hosted by USA, Canada and Mexico.\nHallgrímsson led Iceland to the 2016 Euros and 2018 World Cup as well as Jamaica to the African Cup of Nations last summer.\n“I saw green shoots against Bulgaria, if you excuse the pun,” he noted. “There is a bit more confidence about the team. Winning helps confidence, helps belief. I think the manager is going about it the right way, the World Cup is not undoable.\nIf you think we can beat Bulgaria over two legs home and away, we might be able to finish second to Portugal. That was the way back in my day with Jack. When we qualified, we finished second, now you go to the playoff. I think there is something there, I’m pleased to say after a few barren years.\n“Stephen Kenny has to be given credit for giving all these kids early debuts and exposure to international football. And this new guy might pick up the pay-off from that. A lot of the kids have played over 20 games now. His track record is very good.”\nBrady enlisted several Irish cadets during his time leading Arsenal’s academy but the landscape has shifted since 2021 when Brexit raises the age for emigrants to 18. He’s pleased that St Patrick’s Athletic have pocketed €1.5m from the Gunners’ North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur for Mason Melia, who heads to Spurs at the end of the season.\n“Clubs are going to do that if they have a special player like that,” he stated. “I just hope the money goes back in, clubs realise that this is what we can do if we have good players and we coach them well.\n“Players in those two years between 16 and 18 need to get good coaching, competitive matches are play in good facilities. My guess is they’re probably not.\n“But I suppose his (Melia’s) profile came about because he was playing with the first team.”",
