  "text": "Person of interest in custody in attack against 2 Jewish students at DePaul University\nChicago police did not provide additional details about the arrest. The attack happened on Nov. 6 outside the DePaul student center in the 2200 block of North Sheffield Avenue in Lincoln Park.\nA person of interest is in custody in an attack last November against two Jewish students at DePaul University.\nChicago police did not provide additional details about the arrest. The attack happened on Nov. 6 outside the DePaul student center in the 2200 block of North Sheffield Avenue in Lincoln Park.\nMax Long and Michael Kaminsky were outside the student center when they were approached and attacked by two men wearing black face masks, according to Chicago police. The incident was being investigated as a hate crime.\nLong and Kaminsky filed a lawsuit against DePaul earlier this month, alleging the university was negligent and failed to protect their safety while on campus.\nLong suffered a concussion, and Kaminsky fractured his wrist during the attack, the complaint says. A DePaul Public Safety officer was also present but failed to intervene, according to the lawsuit.\n“Jewish students should feel safe on their own campus,” Kaminsky said at a news conference announcing the suit. “When universities infringe upon these rights, accountability must be demanded.”\nThe university has condemned the attack, saying “such an act clearly defies DePaul’s values to uphold and care for the dignity of every individual.”\nThe attack took place several months after pro-Palestinian students erected an encampment on DePaul’s campus, following a national trend that saw students call for an end to the Israeli bombardment of Gaza in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks in Israel.\nThe Trump administration has targeted students who had been involved with pro-Palestinian activism or speech, with a few high-profile detentions of students including Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder who was a leader of protests at Columbia University in New York.\nBut schools are also seeing visas stripped from students with no known connection to protests. In some cases, past infractions such as traffic violations have been cited. Some colleges say the reasons remain unclear to them — and they are seeking answers.\nIllinois Democrats await decisions from Durbin, Pritzker that will spark high-stakes political shuffle",
