  "text": "ADDED ASSET The Philippine military plans to procure at least 10 TH-73A helicopters from the United States (one photographed here on Aug. 6, 2021, in Milton, Florida), according to Manila’s top envoy to Washington. —US Navy photo\nMANILA, Philippines — After approving the sale of 20 F-16 fighter jets to the Philippines, the US Department of State has approved the sale of an unspecified number of training helicopters to Manila worth $120 million, which could be an added boost to the military’s assets in the face of growing tensions in the region.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said the approval came after the Philippines requested to buy from the US TH-73A training helicopters.\nArticle continues after this advertisement The DSCA and Manila have not disclosed how many helicopters the Armed Forces of the Philippines wanted to acquire.\nA US state department officer informed the Inquirer in an email that the government is considering buying “up to six” training helicopters. Manila’s envoy to Washington, Ambassador Jose Manuel Romualdez, told the Inquirer that the plan was to procure “at least 10” of them.\nREAD: US approves sale of 20 F-16 fighter jets worth $5.5 billion to PH\nThe AFP had also requested to purchase aircraft simulators, spare engines, pack-up kits, fuel tanks, aircraft hoists and lifts, commercial avionics, and commercial flight management systems.\nThe DSCA said Congress had been notified of the approval of the possible Foreign Military Sales (FMS) of training helicopters to the Philippines, the United States’ oldest treaty and military ally in the region.\nArticle continues after this advertisement Funding options Under the US FMS, a country “may purchase or receive US-made defense articles and services either with their own funds or with funds provided through US government-sponsored assistance programs.”\nIn certain cases, defense equipment may be obtained through grants or leases, according to the DSCA.\nArticle continues after this advertisement It said that the principal contractor of the training helicopters would be the AgustaWestland Philadelphia Corporation in Philadelphia (Leonardo).\nThe proposed sale followed two weeks after the US approved the sale of F-16 aircraft to the Philippines for an estimated cost of $5.58 billion (or P319 billion).\nIt also came after US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth visit to the Philippines on March 28, where he renewed Washington’s “ironclad commitment” to Manila’s defense.\nThe DSCA said the proposed sale would support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by “helping to improve the security of a strategic partner that continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in Southeast Asia.”\nBeijing, which has a long-standing maritime dispute with Manila over the West Philippine Sea, has warned the Philippines against threatening “regional peace” after the United States approved the sale of F-16 fighter jets.\nProcurement plan “The Philippines’ defense and security cooperation with other countries should not target any third party or harm the interests of a third party. Nor should it threaten regional peace and security or exacerbate regional tensions,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said earlier this month.\nEarlier, AFP chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. said the military would procure more assets for the military, including missile systems, warships, and multi-role fighter jets, “to build a strong and reliable deterrent force.”\nIn 2024, President Marcos approved the military’s revised wish list for its “Re-Horizon 3,” the last stage in the AFP modernization program.\nThe new procurement plan would have a timeline of 10 years and is expected to cost about P2 trillion.\nYour subscription could not be saved.
