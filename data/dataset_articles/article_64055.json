  "text": "AUSTIN __ State employees asked Texas House lawmakers Wednesday for more flexibility to work from home as agencies enact stricter rules for the state’s nearly 150,000 workers following a March order by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. For one environmental worker, the ability to continue his remote job means the encouragement to stay in the state he loves.\n“When I finished graduate school, I had job offers around the country, but I chose Texas,” Sam Bickley, a hydrologist at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, told a government efficiency committee. “My family chose Texas, and I chose this job at TCEQ. Now I’m asking each and every one of you to choose workers like me.”\nBickley said flexibility has allowed him and his coworkers to be nimble in their jobs managing water quality. He asked legislators to support legislation that would put agencies’ rights to make telework arrangements into state law.",
