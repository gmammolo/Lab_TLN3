  "text": "Thai authorities crackdown on Indian call center gang in Thailand\nPATTAYA, THAILAND – In a decisive operation, the Immigration Bureau’s Investigations Division (Immigration Division 3), in collaboration with local officials in Sriracha District, dismantled an Indian call center gang operating out of rented pool villas in Chonburi province.\nThe gang was accused of scamming fellow Indian nationals into online gambling schemes, Pattaya Mail reported.\nRaid uncovers scamming operation in sriracha\nLed by Colonel Jiraphong Rujiradamrongchai, Chief of the Investigation Division at Immigration Division 3, authorities arrested eight individuals, one man and seven women, during the raid.\nEvidence seized included laptops, Wi-Fi routers, mobile phones, Indian SIM cards, CCTV cameras, passports, and cash totaling Rs 50,000 (US$583.47)\nInvestigations revealed that the gang leader had rented three pool villas under a one-year contract with a monthly rental fee of 95,000 Baht (US$2,846.87). The suspects claimed to be working for a U.S.-based company while living together in the villas.\nThey reportedly scammed 10 to 20 individuals daily by luring them into online gambling schemes.\nSeveral suspects arrested in connection with a call center scam in Thailand revealed they initially entered the country as tourists but were recruited into the operation after running out of money, with their roles typically lasting a month before being replaced by new recruits.\nAuthorities actions towards growing scam concerns\nLaw enforcement authorities actively work toward identifying further members of the gang followed by seeking appropriate legal consequences.\nThe government initiated these actions to stop call center scams because they lead to major financial losses and target defenseless people.\nPrime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra leads the government efforts to suppress scams through electricity cutoffs and internet service interruptions.\nAs authorities intensify their efforts, operations like the Sriracha raid highlight the importance of vigilance against evolving scam tactics targeting unsuspecting victims worldwide.",
