  "text": "N.B. signs free trade pact with Ontario\nPremiers pledge to keep pushing other provinces to come up with similar agreements to reduce trade barriers within Canada\nArticle content\nNew Brunswick has signed a free trade agreement with Ontario, the biggest market in Canada with more than 16 million people, as uncertainty swells over U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs.\nPremier Susan Holt and Ontario Premier Doug Ford – dubbed Captain Canada for taking on the belligerent president – signed the memorandum of understanding on Wednesday in Toronto to reduce trade and labour mobility barriers.\nNova Scotia Premier Tim Houston took part as well, inking a separate free trade agreement between his province and Ontario.\nThe goal is to move forward as quickly as possible and remove as many barriers as possible.\nSusan Holt\nBut noticeably absent from the ceremony were the 10 other provincial and territorial premiers, all of whom have talked about the importance of showing unity in the face of Trump’s threats.\n“It’s a great day for New Brunswick because New Brunswick entrepreneurs and businesses are now going to have free and clear access to a market of millions and millions of people in Ontario,” Holt said at a news conference on Wednesday after the signing ceremony.\n“I’m excited about that. The goal is to move forward as quickly as possible and remove as many barriers as possible to trade across this country.”\nSince taking office in November, the Republican president has launched a global trade war, spooking markets and raising fears of a widespread economic recession. He has already tariffed Canadian autos, aluminum and steel, and threatened even more punishing duties.\nTrump’s repeated comments that he wants to turn Canada into his country’s 51st state has rankled Canadians and become the dominant issue in the lead up to the April 28 federal election.\nThe three leaders admitted they had work to do convincing other premiers to sign similar agreements. And it was odd to see Ford sign separate deals with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia but not the two neighbouring Maritime provinces sign agreements with each other.\nHolt said she was confident the Atlantic provinces would hammer out a deal soon, noting that even Andrew Furey, the outgoing premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, is intent on signing an agreement before his successor is picked by Liberal Party members on May 3.\nQuebec, which borders New Brunswick and is its biggest trading partner, poses one of the biggest barriers to free trade because its labour agreements protect the local workforce from others taking their jobs.\nQuebec Premier François Legault has also been slow to smooth transportation bottlenecks, finishing the twinning of the TransCanada highway that runs through his province at a pace much slower than what the Canadian Chambers of Commerce had demanded.\nThe untwinned section, from Saint-Antonin to Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha! near New Brunswick is supposed to be converted to a divided, four-lane highway by the end of 2026 after years of delays.\nMuch was made at the press conference about how New Brunswick and Ontario would use the same transportation rules on everything from tire pressure, to safety vests, to first aid kits. The idea is to ensure transport trucks don’t need to swap out or change parts and equipment when they move across borders, lowering costs and making trade smoother and more seamless.\nBut, Quebec, with its own set of transportation rules, must be crossed first, a journey of hundreds of kilometres.\n“I have started the conversation with Premier Legault to assess his willingness to get into this and really tackle some of the sticky labour mobility challenges that we’ve been facing between New Brunswick and Quebec for a long time,” Holt said.\n“We also hope that Quebec agrees to change their transportation rules to recognize our drivers, and our vehicles, and our tire pressure and flags the same way we are prepared to recognize theirs.”\nCanada has had free trade with the United States since 1989, when it entered into force, but interprovincial trade barriers remain.\nYou talk about tariffs, my goodness, we’ve been tariffing each other, it seems, for decades, generations.\nDoug Ford\nFord said studies show that growth domestic product would rise between four and eight per cent with freer trade within Canada, adding $200 billion of economic activity.\n“Across the country internal trade barriers increase the cost of everyday goods and services by nearly 15 per cent,” the Progressive Conservative premier said. “You talk about tariffs, my goodness, we’ve been tariffing each other, it seems, for decades, generations, actually.”\nFord said much like Trump’s tariffs, “these trade barriers hurt our economy, drive away jobs and investment, and divide us from each other. With President Trump taking direct aim at Canada’s economy, it can’t be business as usual.”\nWhile most economists suggest free trade with the United States was good overall for Canada, there was upheaval along the way, with plant closures and job losses in certain sectors, especially when Canadians failed to compete.\nHolt said she wasn’t worried that would happen to some New Brunswick businesses if they compete without barriers with Ontario.\nWith 16 million people in Ontario versus the fewer than 900,000 in New Brunswick, she argued “the balance is in our favour,” for homegrown products like Mrs. Dunster’s donuts and Petit-Sault beer.\nAnd she said the $1.7-billion New Brunswick seafood industry could fill the plates of scores of Ontarians with more lobster, crab, red fish, oysters and mussels.\n“I am not expecting that businesses will close because they can’t compete,” Holt said. “Our government has been very keen to work with New Brunswick entrepreneurs on their competitiveness, their productivity, their access to markets, their automation.\n“And so, in partnership with the federal government, we’ve been encouraging businesses to get really lean and mean, and we’ve never had more interest from businesses that really want to seize this opportunity, with the threat the tariffs have imposed, to make investments.”\nAlthough there was a lot of serious economic talk, there were moments of levity too.\nOntario is introducing legislation to ensure any other province that does not impose trade barriers to goods from Canada’s most populous province will receive the same free access for its own goods.\nFord, who’s noticeably wider than the slim and fit Houston, mentioned one of his favourite treats.\n“You can tell this guy’s in shape,” he said gesturing toward Houston. “He hasn’t eaten too many pizzas like me, but anyways, I’ll go with the frozen pizza. The frozen pizza made in Nova Scotia will be automatically recognized as very safe to buy and eat here in Ontario. And to take that one step further, if the truck driver who’s moving those frozen pizzas is trained and certified in Nova Scotia, their credentials will automatically be recognized here.”\nNew Brunswick has already begun dismantling trade barriers with other provinces. Last month, the Liberal government introduced legislative amendments, aimed at improving labour mobility and reducing interprovincial obstacles.\nAmendments to the Fair Registration Practices in Regulated Professions Act, when passed by the Liberal majority, would allow people in regulated professions to begin working immediately in their new jurisdiction during the registration process.\nAmendments to the Liquor Control Act would allow New Brunswickers to participate in the direct-to-consumer sales of alcohol and erase personal exemption limits for alcohol. Previously, the New Brunswick government had fought all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada to retain the right to confiscate alcohol and fine New Brunswickers who brought in too much booze from Quebec or other provinces.\nThe three premiers pledged to keep pushing other Canadian provinces to reduce barriers and sign similar deals.",
