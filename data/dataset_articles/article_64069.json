  "text": "A local man killed in a Wednesday highway crash is being remembered.\nAccording to Massachusetts State Police, at approximately 11:20 a.m., the Dartmouth Barracks received a report of a three-car crash involving a tractor trailer on Interstate 195 West in the Town of Dartmouth. The caller indicated that one of the operators was not breathing and that person was declared dead at the scene by Dartmouth EMS.\nThe deceased operator was identified as Anthony Moniz, 62, of New Bedford.\nThose who knew Moniz, like Jimmy James, described a supportive friend who was more than the musical talent that he possessed.\n“I’ve known Tony for many years because of the music scene. Tony was that friend that you might not see all the time, but he’s always there, watching and cheering you on. Tony saw me at my worst of times and encouraged (me) to do better. He always made me feel like I mattered, and I don’t just mean musically but as a human being, which meant more to me than anything. Tony would always greet me with a big hug and a kiss on the cheek and I’m gonna miss that. I’m gonna miss his smile.”\nThe cause of the crash, and the circumstances, remain under investigation by Massachusetts State Police.",
