  "text": "We confidently support Susan Moore-Fontenot for reelection to the Lee College Board of Regents. Susan has a proven track record of leadership and dedication to the Lee College community. It would be difficult to list the many programs she has initiated and successfully championed. Her commitment and leadership serving on both state and national community college boards greatly benefit Lee College.\nMuch has been accomplished under her leadership, yet some of our greatest challenges lie ahead. Behind her decades of experience as an educator lies a deep passion and perseverance to help students improve their lives through higher education. Susan brings more than experience. She brings vision. Her institutional knowledge, paired with her active involvement at state and national levels of community college leadership make her an irreplaceable asset. She has raised Lee College’s profile among government leaders and continues to represent our students and community with integrity.",
