  "text": "Members of Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) bloc have reaffirmed their loyalty to President Bola Tinubu and the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).\nThe defunct CPC is former President Muhammadu Buhari's party. It merged with others to form the APC and eventually kicked out the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from power in 2015 after the latter had ruled for 16 years.\nOther parties that formed the merger include the new Peoples Democratic Party (nPDP), Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), and a faction of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA).\nMeanwhile, there have been speculations about a purported move by the CPC bloc to exit the APC over the Tinubu administration's alleged marginalisation.\nALSO READ: PDP leaders are secretly backing APC – coalition alleges\nThe reports come amid growing talks by main opposition leaders to form a big coalition ahead of the 2027 elections to challenge the ruling APC.\nHowever, in a statement issued after a meeting on Wednesday, April 16, 2025, the CPC bloc described the rumoured defection of their members as “false and mischievous.”\nThey reiterated that they “remain resolutely committed to the APC,” describing the party as a “collective project” that must be protected.\n“We, the undersigned leaders and committed members of the former Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), who were part of those instrumental in the historic merger that gave birth to the All Progressives Congress (APC), hereby issue this statement to clarify our unalloyed loyalty to our great party and express firm solidarity with the administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR,” the statement reads.\n“We wish to state categorically that we have neither left the APC nor do we intend to leave.\n“The CPC bloc remains one of the legacy foundations of the APC, and we are resolute in our commitment to the party and its progressive ideals.”\nCPC bloc is proud to be part of the APC\nAt the same time, bloc members stressed that they are proud of the sacrifices made to build the APC and warned against any attempt to dismantle the platform.\n“We will not allow some people to dismantle the party we helped to build through years of tireless work and dedication,” the group said.\nThe former CPC members described ongoing efforts to sow a seed of discord in the ruling party as an act of “division and desperation” that they “totally reject.”\n“We align ourselves fully with the economic and governance reforms being undertaken by President Bola Tinubu,” the CPC leaders said.\n“Though challenging, these policies are necessary steps to rebuild our economy and secure a better future for all Nigerians.\n“We urge patience and collective support as the benefits unfold; while we acknowledge that some party members may feel sidelined, we emphasise that such grievances are not exclusive to any one bloc.\nALSO READ: Ganduje declares NNPP 'dead' as Kwankwaso plots APC return\n“We advise those concerned to seek redress through constitutional channels within the party and not to resort to negative public agitation or hasty exits from the party.”\nThe statement was signed by 23 leaders of the defunct party, including former governors of Katsina and Nasarawa, Aminu Masari and Umaru Al-Makura, respectively; Adamu Adamu, former education minister; and Farouk Aliyu, former member of the House of Representatives.\nOthers include Lucy Ajayi, former executive director of the Lagos International Trade Fair Complex Management Board; Okoi Obono-Obla, former presidential aide; and Osita Okechukwu, former director-general of the Voice of Nigeria (VON).",
