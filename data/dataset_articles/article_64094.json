  "text": "Poor Tennesseans need affordable meds. This bill ensures they can access them. | Opinion\nHB 1242/SB 1414 is a bill before the Tennessee General Assembly that can protect 340B and the ability of struggling Tennesseans to purchase affordable drugs.\n- Eight other states have passed similar laws to protect affordable drug pricing\n- All savings from affordable drug plans must be reinvested into patient care\n- This care may include pediatrics, dental care, and medication management for low-income and uninsured patients\nTennesseans already struggling to afford their prescriptions are now facing even bigger challenges. The 340B Drug Pricing Program, which helps provide affordable medications through safety-net providers, is under attack.\nIn recent years, drug companies have limited how the program uses contract pharmacies, making it harder for patients to get the medications and care they need.\nHouse Bill 1242 / Senate Bill 1414, a bill before the Tennessee General Assembly, aims to stop these harmful practices and protect 340B. If passed, Tennessee will join states like Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi in protecting patients' access to affordable medication.\nHere’s how 340B works: Drug companies agree to sell certain outpatient medications at a discount to safety-net providers, such as community health centers. In return, these companies receive Medicaid and Medicare payments. Providers then use the savings to make medications affordable and support critical services like pediatrics, dental care, and medication management for low-income and uninsured patients.\nContract pharmacies – including local pharmacies – are essential to this process. They help ensure patients receive their medications close to home. But drug companies are now restricting how these pharmacies can take part, cutting off access to life-saving medications and vital services for patients.\nAvoid higher medical costs for everyone\nThese restrictions hit rural and low-income communities the hardest, where community health centers and local pharmacies are often the only healthcare providers available. B\ny undermining the 340B program, drug manufacturers not only harm patients but also place added strain on pharmacies already navigating tight margins and rising costs.\nFor patients, this means they may go without needed care, leading to worsening health, more emergency room visits, and higher costs for everyone.\nHere's the reality: Protecting the 340B program is a win for both patients and Tennessee’s bottom line.\nUnlike many healthcare programs, 340B doesn’t use taxpayer dollars. And community health centers must reinvest all 340B savings into patient care. This helps lower prescription costs for patients and supports vital services, like OB care in rural areas, which might not survive otherwise.\nLegislature should choose people over profits\nPassing HB 1242 / SB 1414 will put patients first. To date, eight other states have already stepped up to protect their residents by passing similar laws. Tennessee lawmakers can – and must – do the same.\nPharmaceutical companies’ efforts to limit 340B are clear: They want to boost their profits, leaving our state’s most vulnerable patients struggling to obtain the care they need.\nThe question remains, when is enough, enough?\nIt’s time for Tennessee legislators to act. Pass HB 1242 / SB 1414 and protect access to affordable medications for the patients who need them most.\nEditor's note: The Senate version passed 27-5 and the House version passed 82-4, both on April 16.\nLibby Thurman, CEO of the Tennessee Primary Care Association, leverages more than a decade of expertise in health policy, advocacy, and strategic leadership to support Tennessee’s community health centers in improving healthcare access statewide. She can be reached atlibby.thurman@tnpca.org.\nAnthony Pudlo, PharmD, MBA, MSHIA, is the chief executive officer at the Tennessee Pharmacists Association (TPA), the leading professional association in the state representing pharmacists and the profession of pharmacy.
