  "text": "The Brief The City Council passed a resolution urging HR to block the hiring of applicants convicted in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. The measure passed 43-3 and applies regardless of pardon or clemency status. Alderman Gilbert Villegas led the effort, citing the importance of defending democracy. CHICAGO - Chicago is now the first major U.S. city to adopt a policy aimed at keeping Jan. 6 offenders out of city government jobs.\nWhat we know:\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Chicago City Council passed a resolution calling on the city’s Human Resources Commissioner to use discretion in rejecting job applicants who were convicted of crimes tied to the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The measure passed by a wide margin—43 yeas to 3 nays.\nYea-Nay votes on Chicago Jan. 6 hiring resolution | Provided\nThe resolution, R2025-0015310, applies regardless of whether an applicant has received clemency or a pardon and takes effect immediately.\n\"You should not be allowed to work for the same government you are attempting to overthrow,\" said Alderman Gilbert Villegas, the resolution’s chief sponsor. \"There is a misalignment in values there.\"\nThe measure comes after the State of Illinois identified 53 residents involved in the Jan. 6 attack, including several from Chicago. At least one was found to be employed by the city as a police officer.\nFILE - US President Donald Trumps supporters gather outside the Capitol building in Washington D.C., United States on Jan. 06, 2021. (Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\nThe backstory:\nVillegas, a veteran of the United States Marine Corps, said the Capitol riot shook his sense of duty and drew a rare comparison in his life.\n\"There’s only been two times that I’ve thought about putting my uniform on and reactivating—September 11th and January 6th—because this democracy is worth fighting for,\" he said during council remarks.\nHe was joined by Aldermen Chris Taliaferro, Bill Conway, and Matt Martin in sponsoring the measure.\nWhat's next:\nWhile the resolution is not a formal ordinance, it strongly signals the City Council’s stance and gives the Commissioner of Human Resources broad backing to apply the new hiring standard going forward.\nThe resolution takes effect immediately.\nThe Source: The information in this article was provided by the Office of Alderman Gilbert Villegas.",
