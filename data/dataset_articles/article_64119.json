ST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO Judith Tan UPDATED Apr 17, 2025, 02:35 AM Thanks for sharing! SINGAPORE - When PAP candidate for Jalan Besar GRC Shawn Loh, 38, told his four children that he was going to run in the 2025 General Election and serve the country, his elder son wanted to know how he would be addressing the cost of living. And it is not just Mr Loh’s entry into politics that makes the boy, aged 12, more tuned in to current affairs, despite his young age.The family of six does not have a television set at home, so the four children, two boys and two girls, are encouraged to read The Straits Times daily. “I am a subscriber of the hard-copy paper, and I strongly believe that is why my children must also read the paper on a daily basis,” said Mr Loh, speaking to reporters at the Whampoa Drive Market and Food Centre on April 15. His three other children are aged four, seven and 10.",
