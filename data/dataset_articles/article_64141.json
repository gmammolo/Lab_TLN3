  "text": "Greensboro Marine has waited 5 years to go on Triad Honor Flight, says it celebrates military legacy\nIn exactly two weeks from Wednesday, some of our country's bravest will be experiencing the next Triad Honor Flight.\nWXII spoke with one Marine who has been waiting five years for this opportunity. He said for him and many of his peers, the Triad Honor Flight is a very deep and impactful way to honor the legacies of generations of men and women in uniform, giving them the respect they may not have received upon their initial return.\n\"When we came back, it was a years and years before I even let anybody know I had been in the military,\" said Haywood Miller.\nMiller was just 19 years old when he was sent to Vietnam, serving in the Marines from 1967-1973. He’s a survivor of the U.S.S. Forrestal disaster, one of the worst losses of life on a U.S. Navy ship in American history. That experience and more was something he kept to himself for quite a while.\n\"Nobody that I met after I got out the military knew I was in the military,\" he said. \"But now I'm wide open. Anybody else, and they see me, they know I've been in there.\"\nIt’s why he’s looking forward to Triad Honor Flight’s eighth trip to Washington, D.C.\n\"I've been waiting since 2020, so I'm glad and excited to get in here,\" he said. \"I finally get a chance to go.\nExecutive Director Alison Huber says their mission is to honor every veteran they can, a mission that gets more and more important with each passing flight.\n\"The cards and the letters and the calls that we receive after is almost more meaningful,\" she said. \"It's the veteran that calls and says, 'I just can't thank you enough. I've had healing because of this experience.'\"\nThis upcoming flight’s cohort will feature a large group of veterans under the age of 100, and many who are Purple Heart recipients. Huber said it does not matter how many times they make this flight, each one is memorable and unique in its own way.\nHundreds of volunteers and hundreds of hours of planning go into making each Triad Honor Flight a success. That includes interviewing veterans, coordinating their guardians and tour guides, and, of course, preparing their flight.\nMiller shared with us what he is looking forward to the most.\n\"I'm looking forward to going by the Vietnam Memorial and seeing a lot of my classmates' names up on that wall,\" he said. \"People I went to high school with, and people on the ship I was on when it blew up. Just going to see them, in remembrance of them.\"\nApril 30 will be the nonprofit's first flight of this year.\nYou can find more information about the nonprofit, volunteer opportunities and how you can support the mission here.",
