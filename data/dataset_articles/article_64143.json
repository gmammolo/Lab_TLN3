  "text": "Chatt Prep avoids charter revocation, moves forward under probationary status\nCHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (WDEF) — Following several weeks of review and collaboration, Hamilton County Schools and the new leadership at Chattanooga Prep have reached an agreement regarding the schools charter status.\nSuperintendent Dr. Justin Robertson initially recommended revoking the school’s charter.\nHowever, after working closely with Chattanooga Prep’s administration, he decided to allow the school to continue operating while addressing key compliance issues.\nThe probationary status does not impact accreditation or daily operations.\nTo maintain compliance, the school must complete several corrective actions, including:\n- Provide Course Verification for students in grades 6-11 and provide additional evidence that all standards within the course have been taught and assessed for all current students.\n- Provide Proof of Insurance Coverage to ensure no gap in coverage will occur.\n- Update PowerSchool to accurately reflect the Teacher of Record. If an administrator is listed as the Teacher of Record, provide an explanation of how the administrator is teaching the course while also serving in the administrator role.\nCorrective actions that are have already been completed or underway include:\n- Verification and updating of teacher licensures and certifications.\n- A thorough audit of students’ transcripts to ensure timely graduation or promotion for all students who were believed to be on track.\n- Revision of HR procedures to ensure proper hiring, evaluation, and documentation practices.\n- Ongoing collaboration with Chattanooga Prep, HCS, and legal and education consultants",
