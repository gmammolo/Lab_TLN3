  "text": "Mr. Nitin Jain reports\nSIENNA SENIOR LIVING COMPLETES PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ACQUISITION IN OTTAWA\nSienna Senior Living Inc. has finalized its previously announced acquisition of a 165-suite retirement residence in Ottawa, Ont., for a gross purchase price of $48.0-million.\n\"Wildpine Residence is a great addition to our retirement platform in the Ottawa market, which is benefitting from rapidly improving supply-demand fundamentals,\" said Nitin Jain, president and chief executive officer of Sienna. \"With this latest transaction, total acquisitions in 2025 now exceed $250-million.\"\nThe acquisition was financed through the assumption of approximately $25.2-million of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.-insured debt with an interest rate of 3.69 per cent and a remaining term of approximately 7.4 years. The balance was financed with cash on hand.\nSienna anticipates Wildpine Residence to generate an approximate 6.25-per-cent investment yield in the first 12 months of operations and achieve immediate synergies with nearby properties owned by the company. The acquisition was completed at a significant discount to replacement cost and is expected to be immediately accretive to Sienna's adjusted funds from operations per share.\nAbout Sienna Senior Living Inc.\nSienna Senior offers a full range of seniors living options, including independent living, assisted living and memory care under its Aspira retirement brand, long-term care, and specialized programs and services. Sienna's approximately 13,500 employees are passionate about cultivating happiness in daily life.\n© 2025 Canjex Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.",
