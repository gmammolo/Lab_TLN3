  "text": "Telegraph: UK will support Germany's decision to transfer Taurus to Ukraine\nBritain will support the future German Chancellor Friedrich Merz if he decides to send long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine, the Telegraph reports, citing sources.\nAccording to the newspaper's interlocutor, London has long been in favor of Berlin transferring these weapons. Merc will support such a move, he said.\nEarlier, Merz said that the Taurus long-range missiles would be transferred to Ukraine only if agreed with European partners. The politician stressed that \"the Ukrainian army must come out of its defensive position and begin to influence the course of events.\"",
