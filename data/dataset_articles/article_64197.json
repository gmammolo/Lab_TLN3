  "text": "ABUJA – Aminu Umar-Sadiq, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), has assured that the current global economic volatility resulting from ongoing tariff wars will not negatively impact the Authority’s operations.\nSpeaking at NSIA’s 2024 Earnings Presentation to journalists, Umar-Sadiq emphasized that the Authority’s assets have been strategically allocated to protect it from market uncertainties. This comes as US President Donald Trump’s tariff impositions on various goods and services have triggered reciprocal measures, creating instability in the global economy.\n“If you look at our strategic assets’ allocation on the stabilization and the future generations fund side, you will see it is defensive. We have allocations to private equity, we have allocations to hedge funds, and we have allocations to real estate, inflation-linked funds,” Umar-Sadiq explained.\n“And so, whilst on the upside, where the markets are roaring, we may not be fully optimizing, what it does is that it protects us on the downside, which is very, very important, because if you look at the mandate of our sovereign wealth fund, it is largely a savings mandate.”\nAccording to documents provided by NSIA, total assets increased by 96% to ₦4.42 trillion in December 2024 from ₦2.26 trillion in December 2023, demonstrating steady asset growth aligned with equity strength.\nThis remarkable growth was attributed to increased returns from associates and joint venture entities, net gains on collateralized securities, and net foreign exchange gains resulting from naira depreciation.\nThe NSIA has maintained profitability for the 12th consecutive year, closing 2024 with a Total Comprehensive Income (TCI) of ₦1.89 trillion, bringing cumulative retained earnings to ₦3.74 trillion.\nTotal operating profits, excluding share of profits from associates and Joint Venture entities, grew from ₦1.17 trillion in 2023 to ₦1.86 trillion in 2024.\nUmar-Sadiq revealed that since its establishment in 2011, the Authority has received a total of $1.82 billion in net government contributions. “These funds have been efficiently utilized by NSIA resulting in a Net Asset Value (NAV) of $2.84 billion as at December, 2024,” he stated.\nThe NSIA was created by an Act of the National Assembly signed into law by the President on May 26, 2011. Its ownership structure shows that the Federal government holds 46.5 percent, States 34.8 percent, Local Government Areas 18.2 percent, while the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) has 0.5 percent respectively.\nThe Authority’s Core TCI (excluding foreign exchange and derivative valuation gains) rose by 148% to ₦407.9 billion in 2024, supported by robust returns on financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss23. This includes returns from collateralized securities, private equity, hedge funds, and Exchange-Traded Funds.\n“The Authority’s outstanding financial performance in 2024 reflects the strength of our strategic vision, disciplined execution and unwavering commitment to sustainable socio-economic advancement,” Umar-Sadiq remarked.\n“As we move forward, we remain focused on driving economic transformation, expanding opportunities, scaling transformative impact and ensuring long-term prosperity for current and future generations of Nigerians.”",
