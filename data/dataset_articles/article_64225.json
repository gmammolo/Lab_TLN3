  "text": "BELMONT COUNTY, Ohio — Commissioners in Belmont County introduced Matt Abbott as the new President and CEO of Ohio Southeast Economic Development during their meeting Wednesday morning.\nAbbott previously served as the Muskingum County Port Authority Director.\n\"We work with existing companies on expansion efforts. We work on attraction of new companies, we work on sites and site development to get sites ready for businesses to locate,\" Abbott said.\nAbbot, who is no stranger to the area, toured the county to evaluate its assets and business climate.\nBelmont County Port Authority Executive Director Larry Merry emphasized the collaborative efforts between Ohio Southeast Economic Development, Jobs Ohio, and local entities.\n\"They're one of our partners we work with,\" he said. \"We work with them initially and then they work with Jobs Ohio, and it's a combination of the three entities working with businesses to create jobs and investments.\"\nWhen asked about updates on the proposed cracker plant site at Dilles Bottom, Abbott noted the site's potential.\n\"I don't know there's any updates to that,\" he said. \"But that site possesses a lot of assets that we're talking about so it's a very marketable site when that time comes to be marketed. But I think there definitely still is hope that there will be an opportunity for PTT to make an investment and if not at the end of the day the community has one excellent asset.\"\nAbbott and his team are optimistic about the potential for economic development in Belmont County and are eager to work with local officials to enhance the area's growth.\n911 CENTER EMPLOYEES RECOGNIZED\nIn recognition of National Public Safety Telecommunicator Week, the Belmont County Commissioners have honored the county's 911 center with a proclamation.\nBryan Minder, the 911 Director for Belmont County, highlighted the mental demands of the job.\n\"It's not a physically demanding job but it is a mentally demanding job,\" he said. \"You're constantly thinking of others, putting their safety in mind and trying to keep everybody's safety at the forefront.\"",
