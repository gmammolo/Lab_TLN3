  "text": "THIS CONTENT IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY University of Oslo - read more\nHow Norway could succeed when a new crisis strikes\nNorway is well prepared for a new pandemic, but dependent on one factor that money cannot buy, says a media professor.\nOne of the most fundamental cornerstones of democracy is trust, which played a crucial role in the Norwegian authoroties' management of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThis is supported by research conducted by Øyvind Ihlen. He is a professor at the University of Oslo's Department of Media and Communication.\nHigh trust in the authorities\n“Trust in the authorities’ handling of the pandemic was high during the crisis, around 80-90 per cent. However, maintaining trust involves more than just providing information and instructions. People need to feel listened to, understood, and respected,” says Ihlen.\nHe has conducted extensive research on strategic and political communication.\nIn 2022, 77 per cent of Norwegians reported that they had trust in public authorities. Only the Swiss were more trusting than Norwegians, according to an OECD report.\nSince then, Norwegians’ trust in the authorities has declined.\nWhat worked during the pandemic, and what lessons can be carried into upcoming crises?\nFive strategies to build trust\nIn a new book, Ihlen and his colleagues looked at how the authorities responded during the pandemic. They identified five trust-building strategies that were used.\n“The first thing authorities need to do is to demonstrate competence and reliability. They can achieve this by showing that they have plans and strategies in place and are part of an international network,” says Ihlen.\nAt the very beginning of the pandemic, this was precisely where the authorities fell short.\nDespite the overwhelming coverage of high infection rates in Italy, flights carrying potential cases from the country were still permitted to land.\nAt that time, public trust in the authorities reached a low point of under 50 per cent, according to data from the Norwegian Directorate of Health.\nThe effect of rallying together\nWhen measures were implemented and a lockdown was eventually enacted, the trust barometer surged to over 90 per cent.\nNever before had trust in the authorities been as high as during what was described as 'the most intrusive measures Norway has had in peacetime.'\n“When the situation is at its worst and the authorities send a clear signal that this is serious, we see what researchers call the ‘rally around the flag’ effect. People put aside their disagreements and come together to support a common cause,” says Ihlen.\nHe explains that this ability to unite and refrain from criticism gradually diminishes. The event becomes politicised, leading to discussions such as: Didn't we overreact a bit? What's the right way forward now?\nImportant to listen to the people\nA strong emphasis on media visibility and the use of social media is the second strategy for building trust.\nThis helped create a sense of community in facing the pandemic as an external threat.\n“The authorities focused on what we call inviting rhetoric and expressed their desire for feedback from the public. Through this two-way communication, they demonstrated that they were listening to people’s concerns,” says Ihlen.\nMuch of his research is based on observation, primarily from the communications department at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, where researchers involved in the project spent periods of time.\nHe believes that allowing this is a good example of the third trust-building strategy: the authorities promoted transparency.\nOpen about uncertainty\nWhen Ihlen and his fellow researchers compared how the authorities managed the pandemic in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, they found that Norway stood out due to its transparency.\n“The Norwegian authorities were candid about their uncertainties and indicated at one point that recommendations might change over time. They also acknowledged that experts could disagree among themselves, for instance, about whether a cabin ban was an effective measure,\" he says.\nIhlen explains that in both Sweden and Denmark they were more cautious about being open about disagreement and uncertainty in public.\nThis rhetorical strategy – being transparent about the complexities of the pandemic and acknowledging that much was uncertain – fostered a sense of honesty and integrity, signalling that people’s safety was being taken seriously.\nBut would such a strategy work equally well in other countries to gain public trust in the authorities? This is something Ihlen is currently looking into.\nWhat you do matters\nThe authorities did not shy away from the seriousness of the pandemic while also appealing to a sense of collective responsibility.\nIhlen and his research colleagues identify this as the fourth trust-building strategy.\n'Henny, 10, wants to continue meeting her friends at school. That’s why it’s especially important for you to keep your distance, wash your hands, and stay home when you’re sick,'\nThat was in a campaign from the Norwegian Directorate of Health in 2020. It featured a child’s drawing of someone washing their hands.\nThe campaign about Henny is also an example that highlights the last of the five strategies employed during the pandemic:\nDuring crises, it is essential that people are given very concrete information about what to do.\n“We needed a toolbox of actions we could take, such as the encouragement to wash hands. Surveys show that there was a high level of acceptance for these types of instructions,” Ihlen notes.\nAccording to measurements from the Norwegian Directorate of Health, over 90 per cent responded ‘to a large extent’ when asked whether they followed the recommendations from health authorities – except toward the end of the pandemic.\nAn important task for the authorities during crises is also to understand the challenges that make it difficult for the public to follow recommendations and rules.\nThis requires dialogue and the ability to adapt communication in line with a constantly evolving situation, as seen during a pandemic.\nTrust must be foundational\nBut could these five strategies for achieving trust be applied to other crises, such as the climate crisis or in a wartime situation?\n“Being open, providing clear information about what people should do, and engaging in two-way communication are important rhetorical strategies that will work in most crises. However, the contexts are entirely different,” says Ihlen.\nHe illustrates this with some examples:\nNorway, for instance, has a high number of climate sceptics. This must be seen in the context of how important oil is to the Norwegian economy. The climate crisis is also perceived as less urgent compared to the immediacy a wartime situation might present. In a wartime situation, dialogue and relationship-building may take a backseat to decisive action and instructions.\n“But again, we need trust across all these situations,” Ihlen points out.\nHe highlights how crucial it is that people have faith in the authorities’ competence, that they do not conceal important information, and that, at their core, they have the public’s best interests at heart.\n“The critical challenge now relates to political polarisation and the politicisation of research. We are seeing an increasing tendency for many to dismiss research they do not agree with, or that does not align with their worldview. This poses a challenge not only for trust in research and institutions but for society and democracy as a whole,” says Ihlen.\nReference:\nIhlen et al.
