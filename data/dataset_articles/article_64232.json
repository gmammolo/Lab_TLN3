  "text": "XRP's Bullish Momentum Hinges on $2.25 Weekly Close\nXRP has recently regained momentum, trading above $2.00, and analysts are closely watching its performance for signs of a bullish trend. Crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO has highlighted that this week could be pivotal for XRP, as its closing price will determine the direction of its momentum. According to EGRAG's analysis, the current weekly candle for XRP is hovering just above $2.10 and the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The key indicator for a bullish continuation is whether XRP can close the week above $2.25 with a full-bodied candle.\nThe $2.25 level is crucial for XRP's price recovery, as it represents the final resistance before validating the recovery structure that has been forming since the sharp retracement in March and April. EGRAG's weekly chart shows XRP stabilizing above the 21-week EMA, which adds credibility to the potential for a bullish continuation. A weekly close above $2.25 would mark the first full-bodied weekly candle above the 21W EMA in the past four weeks, confirming that bulls have regained dominance and that a bottom was established on April 7.\nIf XRP successfully closes above $2.25, it suggests that the April 7 bottom will continue to hold as support. The chart outlines close price targets at $2.51 and $2.60, with Fibonacci extension levels projecting even higher zones at $2.69 on the way to crossing back above $3. However, if XRP fails to close above $2.25, it could reintroduce bearish narratives, including potential market disruptions due to recent tariff issues between the US and China. A strong rejection could see the XRP price pull back toward the $1.96 Fibonacci level or even lower into the broader support band of around $1.58 to $1.30, making the white box region on the chart the primary battleground for bulls and bears.",
