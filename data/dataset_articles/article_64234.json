  "text": "Gov. Hochul: NYS lawmakers 'on verge' of a deal on key issue holding up state budget\nALBANY — Gov. Kathy Hochul said Wednesday that lawmakers were \"on the verge\" of reaching a deal on \"discovery,\" the sharing of evidence in criminal trials that has been holding up a larger agreement on a state budget.\n\"I believe we’re on the verge of a very important deal,\" Hochul told reporters. Using a football analogy, she said lawmakers were \"on the 5-yard line\" but not in the end zone yet.\nAssembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx) — who took a lead role in negotiating directly with New York City’s five district attorneys — said: \"I think it’s actually on the 1-inch line\" with just minor legal language details to finalize.\nClearing up the issue would have a domino effect on settling other outstanding ones — a cellphone ban in schools, financial aid to school districts, for example — and setting course for the State Legislature to vote on budget deal this month.\nLawmakers were supposed to approve a budget by April 1, the beginning of New York’s fiscal year. Hochul held out, as she has done in previous years, to get some largely non-budgetary policy issues, such as discovery, in the budget agreement.\nIn January, Hochul proposed a $252 billion state budget, including a 4.7% increase in school aid, a middle-class tax cut and tax rebate check of as much as $500 to families. The final agreement is expected to spend more overall and include a more generous hike in school aid.\nHochul, who has been pressured by the political right on crime and criminal justice issues, made \"discovery\" changes a priority.\nNew York overhauled its discovery law in 2019, making prosecutors share evidence sooner and, practically speaking, tying their discovery obligations to speedy trial guarantees — a trial within 90 days for most misdemeanors and six months for many felonies. Previously, prosecutors could wait till the eve of a trial to share evidence.\nProsecutors complained the new law resulted too many dismissals — driven largely by New York City, which accounts for more than 92% of case dismissals statewide.\nIn simple terms, the compromise will give judges more express discretion to weigh whether failure to turn over a piece of evidence actually causes harm to a person’s defense — something prosecutors wanted. But it rejects prosecutors’ call for decoupling discovery rules and speedy trial guarantees, Heastie told Newsday.\nRank-and-file Democratic legislators didn’t want to give all the leverage back to prosecutors, Heastie and numerous other legislators had said over the weeks of negotiations.\nHeastie told Newsday: \"I think we all landed in a pretty good place.\"\nBrooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, at the news conference with Hochul, said: \"Judges are going to have individual ability to look at a case\" to determine if the failure to share a piece of evidence is harmful or just tangential to a case.\nHochul said final \"edits\" are being hashed out — but nothing is final until that is accomplished.\n\"I think we're very, very close to being done, and perhaps today will be the day we say\" so, Hochul said.\nALBANY — Gov.
