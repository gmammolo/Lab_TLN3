  "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. - The California Transportation Commission has allocated $9.98 million in emergency funds to enhance the resiliency of the LOSSAN rail corridor in Orange County.\nThis move aims to prevent disruptions caused by climate-related issues like slope erosion and landslides.\nAccording to the Commission, these improvements will protect a seven-mile segment of the rail line, which is crucial for over 150 daily passenger trains and more than $1 billion in freight annually.\n\"The LOSSAN rail corridor is an integral part of California’s transportation system,\" said Commission Chair Darnell Grisby.\nCalifornia Transportation Secretary Toks Omishakin highlighted the importance of this investment, emphasizing its role in ensuring a reliable rail system that benefits millions of Californians.\n\"Today’s critical investment, which was only made possible through the close cooperation among our many partners, underscores our shared urgency in ensuring a reliable and resilient rail system that improves the lives of Californians,\" said Omishakin.\nThe emergency funds will be used for initial work, including repairing rip-rap to protect against coastal erosion and removing the damaged Mariposa pedestrian bridge.\nCaltrans Director Tony Tavares expressed commitment to enhancing rail travel convenience and sustainability for Californians through these improvements.\n\"Decisive action taken today at the California Transportation Commission helps power our effort to secure ease of movement through this vital transportation corridor,\" said Tavares.\nThe funding is part of a larger $205 million that was awarded to the Coastal Rail Infrastructure Resiliency Project by the Commission and CalSTA in October 2024.\n*AI assisted with the formatting of this story.
