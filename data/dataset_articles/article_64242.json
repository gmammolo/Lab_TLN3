  "text": "Penry Park in Petaluma is named for Medal of Honor recipient Sgt. Richard Penry, who received a posthumous pardon for a drug conviction Wednesday. Google Maps The state Supreme Court granted Gov. Gavin Newsom’s request on Wednesday for a posthumous pardon for Army Sgt. Richard Penry of Petaluma, who was awarded the presidential Medal of Honor in 1971 for rescuing 23 fellow soldiers in Vietnam, then was convicted of drug crimes while suffering severe emotional distress after his discharge.\nPenry died of cancer in 1994, at age 45, and the city of Petaluma has since named two sites in his honor, Penry Park and the Sgt. Richard Penry Medal of Honor Memorial Military Museum.\nThe nation properly honored Penry “for his extraordinary service and heroism at the risk of his own life,” Eliza Hersh, Newsom’s deputy legal affairs secretary, said in the governor’s clemency application to the court.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n“Justice has been done for Sgt. Richard Penry, his family, and so many of our veterans who suffer in silence in their service to our Country,” Petaluma City Manager Peggy Flynn said Wednesday.\nPenry joined the Army in March 1969 and was stationed in Vietnam’s Binh Tuy Province in January 1970 when his unit came under mortar and rocket fire. According to an Army report released by President Richard Nixon in his Medal of Honor declaration in January 1971, Penry provided first aid to the wounded company commander and others, turned back an assault by 30 soldiers, then crawled through heavy fire to reach additional wounded combatants.\nHe led five men to safety, and after evacuation helicopters arrived, went back and carried 18 wounded soldiers to the evacuation site, the report said.\n“Sergeant Penry’s extraordinary heroism at the risk of his own life (was) in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army,” said the report released by Nixon.\nWhen other troops arrived at the scene, Penry “was just sitting on a log by himself, just smoking a cigar, shaking,” a fellow soldier, former Army Maj. Andrew LeMarquand, told CBS News.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nIt may have been the first sign of post-traumatic stress disorder Penry suffered after his discharge in March 1971. He was convicted in 1973 of selling cocaine to an undercover police officer and was arrested twice more on suspicion of other drug offenses but was freed on probation until 1976, when he was sentenced to seven months in jail in 1976 for violating the terms of his probation.\nLeMarquand and other veterans have campaigned to clear Penry’s name, seeking pardons from Newsom and from then-President Joe Biden for a separate federal drug conviction. No response to that request has been reported yet from the White House.\nThe state Supreme Court granted Newsom’s request in a brief order Wednesday with no indication of dissents from any of the seven justices.\nThe case is Penry on Clemency, No. S289024.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nReach Bob Egelko: begelko@sfchronicle.com",
