  "text": "GSK (GSK, Financial) has announced a positive decision from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which has extended its recommendation for the use of RSV vaccines to include GSK’s AREXVY. This update encompasses adults aged 50 to 59 who have a heightened risk of severe RSV disease. This demographic includes individuals with underlying health conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes, and heart disease, as well as those residing in care facilities.\nThe ACIP's recent vote expands upon their earlier recommendation from June 2024, which approved RSV vaccines for adults aged 60 to 74 at increased risk, along with all individuals aged 75 and over. AREXVY is designed to prevent lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) associated with RSV, now recommended for both the 60-plus age group and at-risk adults aged 50 through 59.\nResearch indicates that RSV is responsible for approximately 42,000 hospitalizations annually among U.S. adults aged 50 to 64. Those with pre-existing medical conditions, such as COPD, asthma, heart failure, and diabetes, face a higher risk of severe outcomes from RSV infections. The virus can worsen these conditions, potentially leading to severe complications like pneumonia, hospitalization, or even death.\nWall Street Analysts Forecast\nBased on the one-year price targets offered by 7 analysts, the average target price for GSK PLC (GSK, Financial) is $38.89 with a high estimate of $45.00 and a low estimate of $33.96.
