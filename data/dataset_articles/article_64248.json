  "text": "RICHMOND — Democrats are off to a head start in fundraising for Virginia’s busy campaign season, with former Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D) reporting a big cash lead over Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R) in the race for governor and Democrats outraising Republicans overall in contests for 100 seats in the House of Delegates, according to campaign finance reports filed this week.\nSpanberger reported raising $6.7 million during the first three months of the year as of a midnight Tuesday state filing deadline — more than double the $3.1 million raised by Earle-Sears, according to an analysis by the Virginia Public Access Project.\nEarle-Sears’s fundraising was restricted at the start of the year because she was not allowed to raise money during the General Assembly session, which ran from Jan. 8 through Feb. 22, as she presided over the state Senate in her role as lieutenant governor. The Republican ended the quarter with a little over $4 million in cash on hand, while Spanberger finished the period with just over $11 million in the bank.\nThe already astronomical totals reflect the outsize attention aimed at the Virginia gubernatorial race, which is always a barometer for political sentiment following a presidential election but carries extra freight this year. Democrats are hoping to make a strong stand against the Trump administration while Republicans look to extend their brand in a purple state, all with a historic contest that virtually ensures Virginia will have its first female governor. If Earle-Sears were to win, she would be the first African American woman to lead any state.\nHere are highlights from the campaign-finance filings:\nBig-money donors\nOut-of-state billionaires opened their wallets for both gubernatorial candidates along with homegrown, high-dollar donors such as unions and coal barons.\nSpanberger’s two largest contributors were VoteVets Federal PAC ($500,000) and the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees Working Families Fund ($250,000).\nA handful of California billionaires donated $100,000 to her campaign, including Gwendolyn Sontheim Meyer, heiress of Cargill, one of the world’s largest commodities traders, and LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman. Elizabeth Simons, daughter of hedge fund billionaire James Simons and chairwoman of the Heising-Simons Foundation, also gave $100,000. So did her husband, hedge fund manager Mark Heising.\nEarle-Sears’s largest donor was Thomas Peterffy, a national GOP megadonor and Florida resident who donated $3 million to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC in 2023 as he publicly called on Youngkin (R) to enter the 2024 presidential race. Peterffy gave $300,000 to Earle-Sears — and $1 million to Youngkin’s PAC, bringing his total contributions to Spirit of Virginia to $4 million.\nPeterffy, the world’s 27th-richest person, according to Forbes, which put his net worth at $57.3 billion in March, declined to comment through a spokeswoman.\nOther major donors to Earle-Sears include billionaire Earl Gentry Kendrick Jr., founder of Datatel and managing general partner of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team, who gave $150,000. Richard Baxter Gilliam, a southwest Virginia coal magnate who has donated about $7 million to Virginia Republicans over the past two decades, gave her $100,000. Former California congressman and U.S. House speaker Kevin McCarthy (R) donated $50,000.\nNational prospects\nYoungkin’s PAC raised $1.9 million and ended the quarter with about $1.6 million in the bank. The term-limited governor could tap the PAC to help Republicans in Virginia this year or transfer the money to a PAC supporting his potential 2028 presidential bid, which he has been mulling since taking a pass on the 2024 race. Republicans’ performance in the fall could be critical to Youngkin’s national prospects.\nAside from Peterffy, the PAC’s biggest donors were: Tiger Lily Capital, a Charlottesville financial services outfit, which donated $150,000; Arkansas poultry magnate Ronald Cameron, who gave $100,000; and Rooney Holdings, an international investment company based in Florida, which also gave $100,000.\nDown ballot\nIn the Republican race for lieutenant governor, Pat Herrity, a member of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, raised $540,273 and headed into April with $335,067 in the bank. His lone rival for the nomination, Richmond talk-radio host John Reid, raised $178,110 and ended the quarter with $90,990 on hand.\nIn the six-way Democratic primary, former Richmond mayor Levar Stoney raised the most: $428,802, leaving him with $522,501 in the bank at the end of March. Babur B. Lateef, chairman of the Prince William County School Board, raised $398,269 and had $381,392 on hand.\nTwo of their rivals are state legislators who were barred from fundraising during the 46-day General Assembly session: state Sen. Aaron R. Rouse (Virginia Beach), who raised $399,319 and ended the period with $925,949 in cash; and state Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi (Richmond), who raised $305,871 and had $655,869 in the bank. Union leader and attorney Alex J. Bastani raised $134,137 and headed into April with $33,046. No new report was available for former federal prosecutor Victor Salgado, who had $78,336 in the bank at the end of December.\nIn the race for attorney general, incumbent Jason S. Miyares (R), who is unchallenged for the GOP nomination, raised $1.5 million and had $2.1 million on hand. Two Democrats are vying to take on Miyares in November. Former Norfolk delegate Jerrauld C. “Jay” Jones raised $931,242 and had nearly $1.5 million in the bank. Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor raised $534,275 and had $666,324 on hand.\nBig-money speaker\nIn House of Delegates fundraising, there’s House Speaker Don Scott (D-Portsmouth) and then there’s everybody else — literally. Scott’s total of $813,254 raised for the quarter is greater than the combined amount of the next five best-funded House candidates around the state. With nearly $2.5 million in his war chest, Scott is running unopposed, so he will be able to share some of those riches with other Democrats in key races.\nHis top donor for the period was Dominion Energy, which gave $100,000 and has long been the most generous benefactor to leaders of both major parties. Scott’s other major contributors included state auto dealers and several casino interests.\nBlue push for the green\nOverall, the $3.7 million raised by Democratic House candidates was more than double the $1.5 million total raised by Republicans for the three months, according to VPAP. The gap narrows when it comes to cash on hand — Democratic candidates have a total of a little more than $9.3 million; Republicans have almost $6.5 million.\nDemocrats hold a 51-49 majority in the House of Delegates and are hoping anti-Trump fervor will help them pick up a few more seats; the last time Donald Trump was in the White House, Democrats made stunning gains and took their first House majority in a generation. This year, Democratic candidates are running in 91 of the 100 House districts, while Republicans are fielding candidates in 66 districts.\nAfter Scott, the next four top House fundraisers in VPAP’s analysis are also Democrats. Candidate Lily Franklin came in second with $190,338 as she runs in a rematch with incumbent Del. Chris Obenshain (R) in the red-leaning House District 41, which is between Roanoke and Blacksburg in the western part of the state. Franklin, who has $243,466 in cash on hand, came within less than 1 percent of beating Obenshain when they ran in 2023. The Republican reported raising $50,180 for this year’s first quarter and has $88,743 in the bank.\nIn third place was Democrat John McAuliff with $170,820 raised for the three months in his challenge to GOP incumbent Geary M. Higgins in House District 30 in Loudoun County. Higgins reported raising $38,336 for the quarter, but his cash on hand of about $168,000 is greater than McAuliff’s war chest of about $141,000.\nHouse Majority Leader Charniele L. Herring (D-Alexandria) came in fourth with a three-month haul of $165,265 as she runs unopposed, and rounding out the top five was former delegate Elizabeth Guzman (D), who raised $149,043 during the quarter as she tries for a comeback after two years out of office. With $114,100 in the bank, she is running in House District 22 in Prince William County against Republican incumbent Del. Ian T. Lovejoy, whose latest report was not yet available but who had about $26,000 on hand at the start of the year.\nThat district is one of at least eight Republican-held seats that went for Vice President Kamala Harris in last fall’s presidential election, according to a VPAP analysis, creating obvious targets for Democrats in what is expected to be a blue-trending year.\nNational targets\nThe Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee this month announced a seven-figure ad buy and highlighted four closely divided districts held by Democrats that are among the national organization’s priorities. In those four districts, Democrats outraised Republicans by a combined total of $296,013 to $191,963, according to VPAP’s numbers.\nIn one of those close races, though — House District 97 in Virginia Beach — GOP challenger and former delegate Tim Anderson outraised incumbent Del. Michael Feggans, posting $112,192 to the Democrat’s $60,265.",
