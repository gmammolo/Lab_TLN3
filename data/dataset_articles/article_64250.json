  "text": "Mocho councillor welcomes gov’t response to water issues\nKINGSTON, Jamaica — Councillor for the Mocho Division, Romaine Morris, is welcoming a commitment made by Minister without portfolio in the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation, Matthew Samuda, in addressing concerns raised about the Goshen Pumping System and water access in Mocho.\nMorris, in a statement on Wednesday, said he acknowledges the government’s commitment to restoring and improving the water system and appreciates the interventions outlined, including the installation of a new pump and storage capacity upgrades.\nHowever, Morris sought to remind the public that a comprehensive water supply plan had already been developed and approved through a collaboration between the Clarendon Municipal Corporation, the National Water Commission and Rural Water Supply Limited.\nREAD:\nMocho water system upgrades on track – Minister Samuda\nAccording to Morris, this plan, completed before 2020, was designed to ensure 80 per cent water coverage across the Mocho Division. In 2019, funding was secured through Rural Water Supply Ltd, but was rescinded during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe proposal included a 100,000-gallon tank to be built at the highest point in Mocho (land already secured), a $18 million estimate provided by Tankweld Ltd, and water piped from the Goshen system to the tank, then gravity-fed to underserved districts: Belmont, Stewarton, Richmond Park, Mount Airey, Folly, Green Park, Ashley, Mocho Reid, and several schools.\nMorris is now advocating to expand the tank to 200,000 gallons, making it possible to extend piped water to the Toll Gate Division as well.\n“I am ready to meet with Minister Samuda and his team to bring this vision to life. The people of Mocho have waited long enough,” said Morris.",
