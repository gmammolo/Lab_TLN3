  "text": "On Monday, March 24th, Supreme Governor of Region 8 George Zioulas accompanied the Brothers of Sacramento Chapter 153 at the California State Capitol to witness Resolution 35, to recognize March 25 as Greek Independence Day in the State of California, be passed unanimously by the Assembly.\nResolution 35, authored by assemblymember and Greek-American Diane Papan, commemorates the 204th anniversary of Greece’s rebellion against Ottoman rule and celebrates the enduring principles of democracy and freedom shared between Greece and the United States.\n“As we commemorate Greek Independence Day, we honor the bravery and resilience of the Greek people throughout history,” said Papan. “Their struggle for independence and their steadfast commitment to democratic values continue to inspire us.”\nWe applaud our AHEPA Brothers who played an integral part in the organization of this event.",
