  "text": "Efforts to expand a local mosque in Bethpage received a major boost from the Department of Justice. The DOJ backed its claims that the Town of Oyster Bay's decision to reject its application was unfair. \"Muslims on Long Island\" is suing the Town of Oyster Bay after its application to replace two buildings on its property in Bethpage with one larger mosque was rejected. The issue is parking, as the the initial application, filed in 2018, met the parking regulations established by the Town of Oyster Bay. But the town changed the regulation in 2022 - and now required nearly twice as many parking spots for the expansion to take place. MOLI says that would require it to scale back the expansion by 50%, making it \"of no use.\" The Town of Oyster Bay says it does not comment on the specifics of pending litigation. The lawsuit is in federal court and a hearing is scheduled for next month.",
