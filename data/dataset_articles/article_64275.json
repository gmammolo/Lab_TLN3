  "text": "1993 Jesup double murder brought to justice in court\nGLYNN COUNTY, Ga. (WTOC) - A double murder from the town of Jesup was finally brought to justice this month.\nAccording to the District Attorney’s Office for the Brunswick Judicial Circuit, Larry Jenkins, Jr., 49, was convicted of two counts of Malice Murder, two counts of Kidnapping with Bodily Injury, one count of Armed Robbery, and one count of Theft by Taking for the murder of Michael and Terry Ralston.\nThis trial was the third time that Jenkins was tried and convicted for the same crimes.\nEarlier this month WTOC talked with Josh Ralston, the son of Terry Ralston and younger brother of Michael Ralston.\nJosh says his life was continuously turned upside down with each attempt to overturn his conviction.\n“Why do they keep letting this happen… they didn’t have 3 chances at life… and now, he gets this third chance to go free,” said Joshua Ralston.\nOn April 10, a judge sentenced Jenkins to serve four consecutive life sentences with the possibility of parole, which was the maximum sentence that could be imposed. The case was prosecuted and tried by District Attorney Keith Higgins.\nAfter the sentence was imposed, District Attorney Higgins stated “that I did everything I could to make sure that this conviction will stick and withstand any appeal. Going forward, I will do everything I can to make sure that Jenkins will never be free to hurt anyone else.”\nCopyright 2025 WTOC. All rights reserved.",
