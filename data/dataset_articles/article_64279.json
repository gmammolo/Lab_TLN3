  "text": "Follow\nthe podcast on\nAt the end of each week, Mike Hosking takes you through the big-ticket items and lets you know what he makes of it all.\nThe Golden Visas: 7/10\nPart of what's turning out to be a pretty solid run for the Government. There seems genuine interest from the wealthy to come and park up here and grow the place.\nBusiness sales: 6/10\nDemand is up, supply is down. People want to chart their own destiny, which is always a very good sign.\nCoachella: 4/10\nMost people who went borrowed money to pay for their tickets. Clearly no money left over for Golden Visas.\nAndrew Little: 6/10\nGiven Tory Whanau's reputation and record, is it even a race?\nThe women on Bezos' rocket: 2/10\nBrought new meaning to the term space cadets.\nTaupo: 8/10\nShout out for last weekend and the Supercars. Place was packed, looked awesome and Matty Payne was your hero #NZAtItsBest.\nLISTEN ABOVE FOR MIKE HOSKING'S FULL WEEK IN REVIEW\nTake your Radio, Podcasts and Music with you",
