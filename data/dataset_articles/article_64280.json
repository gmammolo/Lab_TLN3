  "text": "GREENE COUNTY, Tenn. (WJHL) — The roar of a motorcycle engine is unmistakable. Many riders wear a vest representing a group or club. One Tri-Cities motorcycle club is shining a positive light on the biker stereotype, and the members have a love for helping their community. Spring is filled with the sound of motorcycles, and the Tennessee Peacemakers Motorcycle Club of Greeneville is out in full force. “Our organization here is a group of men from all walks of life, who love helping our community, doing things for our community,” said member Joshua ‘Renegade’ Waddell. “We like to help kids around Christmastime, buying gifts, stuff like that. And Thanksgiving, we buy meals for families in need. I mean, that’s what, at the end of the day, that makes us happy.” Waddell says the tough exterior and loud motorcycles often receive mixed reactions. But, these members have a passion for helping others. “Honestly, if I had to say, they are the most caring community and the most loving, that they always, no matter what you see, they’re the ones always giving and trying their best to help.” Things like giving away bikes to children at Christmas, hosting Halloween activities, and fundraising for families who have experienced a great loss. “We don’t we don’t do it for credit,” Waddell said. “We do it to honestly be under the radar of it just because we don’t want the credit of helping these families, we just want to do it.” So the members will keep riding, finding freedom in the saddle of a bike, and a way to help others. “We all have a love for motorcycles. That’s the core thing that obviously brings a MC together,” he said. “But when it comes to children or helping our community, there is nothing that gives us a greater joy than just trying to help others.” For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to WJHL | Tri-Cities News & Weather.",
