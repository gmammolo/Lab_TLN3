  "text": "Michelle Obama discussed her relationship with husband Barack Obama on the most recent episode of her podcast. Michelle and her brother Craig launched their IMO podcast - standing for In My Opinion - last month on March 12. Since then, the sibling duo have been climbing up the charts with a number of exciting guests. This episode featured Tracee Ellis Ross, and the discussion centered around dating. Michelle delved into her own relationship at the beginning of the episode. Her brother Craig fondly recalled the last time Michelle brought a new boyfriend home to meet the family - her husband Barack who would later go on to become the president of the United States.

The siblings laughed as they talked about how the family didn’t take their relationship seriously at the beginning. Craig said, “Mich pulls up to the front of the house, and we’re sitting on the front porch waiting for her to bring Barack. She gets out of the car and I remember mom’s first thing was, ‘ooh, at least he’s tall!’” The sibling cracked up recalling the now-distant memory, Craig then adding, “Well it’s too bad it’s not going to last.” Craig continued, explaining how his sister had asked him to take Barack to play basketball, and he was hesitant at first, not wanting to get too close to the man he believed his sister would not be dating long term. Michelle joked that in her youth, she only dated boys who her brother said were good at basketball. She asked what Craig’s impression of Barack was from the court, to which he replied that the former president was a “real team player.” Earlier this year, Michelle sparked divorce rumors when she missed a number of high-profile events including Donald Trump's inauguration and Jimmy Carter's funeral. Despite not addressing the whispers at the time, Michelle recently debunked all suspicions. During a chat with actress Sophia Bush on the Work in Progress podcast, Michelle said, \"That's the thing that we as women, I think we struggle with like disappointing people. I mean, so much so that this year people couldn't even fathom that I was making a choice for myself that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.” \"This couldn't be a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself, right? But that's what society does to us,\" She added, \"I chose to do what was best for me. Not what I had to do. Not what I thought other people wanted me to do.\" Barack and Michelle met while working at a law firm in Chicago , in the late 1980s. They tied the knot in 1992 and share two daughters together.
