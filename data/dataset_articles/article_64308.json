  "text": "Channellock Incorporated and the United Steelworkers Union in Meadville have agreed to terms on a new contract. According to Keith Gushard of the Meadville Tribune, the new contract is waiting on the formal signing by the steelworkers union. This contract will replace an expired three-year deal that employees had been working under until this one was agreed to. Channellock is home to about 300 unionized workers represented by the steelworkers. Our attempts to receive comments on the contract went unanswered by both parties at this time.
