  "text": "The Minns Labor Government has today unveiled its plan to deliver secure jobs and long-term funding to the state's community services sector-benefiting over a million people who rely on these essential support services each year.\nThe Secure Jobs and Funding Certainty (SJFC) roadmap sets out a vision for a strong, stable, and sustainable community sector-one where funding certainty and job security empower service providers to plan ahead, support their staff, and deliver outcomes for the communities who need them most.\nUnder the former Liberal-National Government, community service organisations were trapped in a cycle of short-term, insecure funding-forced to reapply for government grants, often every year. This uncertainty flowed directly to the workforce, with many frontline staff experiencing job insecurity.\nIn contrast, the Minns Labor Government is delivering long-term certainty with five-year funding contracts. This reform means organisations can plan ahead, invest in their workforce, and focus on helping the people who need it-not fighting their way through funding applications.\nWe know that many people across NSW are doing it tough right now-facing housing stress, cost-of-living pressures, and increased demand for critical support. Community service organisations are on the frontline, helping people navigate these challenges every day.\nThese key reforms will bring greater stability to the sector-through five-year funding contracts, less red tape, and more secure jobs, with a focus on permanent employment pathways. More than 7,800 non-government organisations across the sector are expected to benefit, along with the 240,000 workers they employ and over one million people they support each year.\nThese frontline workers-most of whom are women-play a critical role in supporting the most vulnerable people in our community. Their critical work has been especially vital during times of crisis, from natural disasters to the pandemic, and in responding to issues like homelessness and domestic and family violence.\nThis reform delivers on a key election commitment and was developed in partnership with peak organisations, government agencies and the Australian Services Union in consultation with the community services sector.\nThe NSW Government will continue working closely with the sector to turn this shared vision into lasting outcomes for communities across the state.\nUnder the SJFC roadmap, longer term contracts will be balanced by clearer performance and outcome expectations, ensuring taxpayer money is being used effectively and efficiently, and always for the benefit of the community.\nFurther information on the SJFC roadmap is available here: https://dcj.nsw.gov.au/service-providers/secure-jobs-and-funding-certainty-for-community-services.html\nMinister for Families and Communities and Minister for Disability Inclusion, Kate Washington, said:\n\"This is about backing the people who back our communities.\n\"The community services sector shows up every day for children, families, and vulnerable people across NSW-and they deserve the security to keep doing that vital work with confidence.\n\"This roadmap reflects a shift in how we work with the sector-towards longer-term partnerships built on trust, accountability, stability, and shared purpose.\n\"It's a foundational step in building a stronger, more sustainable sector-because when we support the people who care for our communities, everyone benefits.\"\nSecretary, Australian Services Union NSW/ACT, Angus McFarland said:\n\"The community sector workforce is made up of thousands of skilled and experienced workers, mostly women, who provide essential supports and services to the people of NSW.\n\"This roadmap is an important step in the government delivering on its election commitment to provide more permanent jobs for these workers via longer-term funding for the sector.\n\"The ultimate beneficiaries of these reforms are the people of NSW. Five-year funding contracts enable more permanent jobs in the community sector. This means greater stability for both the workers in the sector and for the community when accessing these vital services.\"\nNSW Council of Social Services CEO, Cara Varian said:\n\"We welcome the NSW Government's plan to give essential community workers secure jobs and stable funding.\n\"This plan shows that the government values the workers and organisations that spend their days helping the most vulnerable in our communities. They provide critical frontline services to support people facing homelessness, poverty, domestic violence, and trauma. This is essential work that strengthens communities and improves the health, wellbeing and resilience of NSW.\n\"This initiative represents a step change in the approach to human services contracting and commissioning in NSW. We commend this positive first step and look forward to building on this reform to strengthen and support the community services sector in NSW. We look forward to working with the Minister to make sure these services stay strong and continue changing lives for the better.\"\nhere.",
