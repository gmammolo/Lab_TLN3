  "text": "Gayle King has hit back at critics who dismissively referred to her recent Blue Origin flight as a \"space ride,\" labeling the term \"sexist.\"\nThe esteemed 70-year-old broadcaster was in good company with celebrities like Katy Perry, Jeff Bezos's fiancée Lauren Sanchez, ex-NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights advocate Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn for the brief but momentous 11-minute trip. The all-female crew triumphantly completed their journey to the Kármán line – the universally accepted edge of space - and returned from a secluded Texas ranch on Monday morning aboard Jeff Bezos's rocket.\nThey experienced three minutes of weightlessness before their descent back to Earth. In a post-flight interview, Gayle expressed frustration over the trivializing language used to describe their expedition, stating, \"They call it a ride, which I find very irritating because they never say men went for a ride.\"\nAddressing skepticism about the scientific merit of their voyage, Gayle, alongside Aisha Bowe, discussed the broader implications of space exploration on CBS Mornings on Tuesday. \"There's so many things that have been developed in space that benefit Earth...from pharmaceuticals to, like, research on agriculture,\" Aisha highlighted, reports the Mirror.\n\"And, you know, I paused there because we did research and it was emotional...part of what I accomplished in my flight was I was looking at the future of being able to produce crops that can withstand harsh environments so we can look at food security here on Earth, and simultaneously, we also were able to certify that device so more people could do research on New Shepard,\" she continued.\nGayle previously criticized those who referred to the flight as a \"ride,\" arguing that no one would ever say to a [male] astronaut, \"'What a ride.' [Don't] call it a ride.\"\nShe further clarified, \"It's called a flight or a journey. A ride implies it's something frivolous or lighthearted. There's nothing frivolous about what we did.\"\nThis follows Lauren Sanchez, Jeff Bezos' soon-to-be wife, expressing her hopes in a video post that the mission would inspire others to \"dream big.\" She admitted, \"If someone would have told me that I would be able to go to space one day, I would have definitely, well, I don't know, laughed.\"\n\"I can't believe it's happening. My dad used to teach people how to fly, and I used to hang around the hanger and I thought dreaming of becoming a pilot was a huge deal, and this is even bigger.\n\"The incredible women that are going on this flight are extraordinary in all of their fields, but more importantly, they're incredible storytellers,\" she continued, \"So what I'm hoping for is, this flight is not just transformative for them, but also for all of the people that they tell their story to. Hopefully it sparks that imagination to a dream big and reach for the stars.\"\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\nSign up to our FREE newsletter and get the top stories to your inbox\nDAILY NEWSLETTER: Sign up here to get the latest news and updates from the Mirror US straight to your inbox with our FREE newsletter.",
