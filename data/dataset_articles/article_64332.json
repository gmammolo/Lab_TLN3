  "text": "Mr. Ken Lapierre reports\nROCKY SHORE DISCOVERS LARGE GOLD TARGET OVER THE APPLETON FAULT CORRIDOR\nRocky Shore Gold Ltd.'s initial prospecting and surface sampling program at its 100-per-cent-owned, district-scale Gold Anchor project, located in Newfoundland, has identified a highly prospective 6.0-kilometre-long gold target termed the Lane Pond gold target. The target is located above the Appleton fault corridor; a known gold-bearing fault on the adjoining Queensway project controlled by New Found Gold Corp. Additional gold-bearing targets have also been identified proximal to the JBP fault corridor and the newly discovered North and South fault corridors. The company now controls more than 20 kilometres of the Appleton fault corridor, more than 50 kilometres of the JBP fault corridor and prospective additional major underexplored faults. The Appleton fault corridor and the JBP fault corridor are known to host significant gold discoveries and gold deposits northeast of the Gold Anchor project in central Newfoundland.\nKen Lapierre, president and chief executive officer of Rocky Shore, commented: \"This is an exciting time to be shareholders of Rocky Shore Gold. The Gold Anchor project, part of a promising gold district, continues to yield excellent results. Despite limited exploration on less than 10 per cent of the project, we've identified numerous high-priority areas, including the 6.0-kilometre-long Lane Pond gold target along the Appleton fault corridor, known for major gold deposits. This spring, we'll conduct surface geophysics and basal till sampling at Lane Pond to prioritize areas for our first ever diamond drill core program. Additionally, we look forward to expanding our reconnaissance program of soil/till sampling and boots on the ground prospecting over prospective gold target areas identified to date once winter breakup is complete.\"\n2024-2025 updated exploration summary highlights:\nGold-bearing structures identified: known major faults identified trending southwest onto the Gold Anchor project, including the Dog Bay line fault, the gold-bearing Appleton and JBP fault corridors and the Grub line fault; Additional faults identified: preliminary studies identify the newly discovered North and South fault corridors; both faults are located between the gold-bearing Appleton and JBP fault corridors; Lane Pond gold target identified: the 6.0-kilometre-long Lane Pond gold target discovered along trend to the southwest of the known gold-bearing Appleton fault corridor; the Appleton fault hosts significant gold discoveries and gold deposits on the adjoining ground; values from soil, till and historic till and float samples at Lane Pond ranged from 0.005 gram per tonne gold up to 8.7 g/t gold; future planned exploration will include a diamond drill program in the summer of 2025; Additional gold target areas identified: seven additional gold target areas were discovered along the JBP, North and South fault corridors and the Grub line fault; follow-up surface work planned for the summer of 2025.\nQuality control and reporting protocols\nAll samples are collected and prepared for shipment in the field for submission to Eastern Analytical Ltd. in Springdale, Nfld., an ISO 17025 certified analytical testing facility, for 34-element ICP analysis. Blank and certified reference materials are included such that for every 18 samples, one blank and one CRM are included. Samples are shipped directly by infield personnel, who maintains chain of custody until samples are delivered to the laboratory. Rock preparation at the lab involves crushing up to three kilograms to 80 per cent passing 10 mesh, 250-gram split pulverized to 95 per cent passing 150 mesh. Both soil and till samples are dried at 60 C and sieve up to 100 grams to 80 mesh. Analytical procedures include four-acid digestion and ICP-34 analysis. For gold analysis, a 30-gram sample is subjected to fire assay, digested in aqua regia and analyzed by atomic absorption. For base metals, 200 milligrams of sample material are digested using four-acid digestion and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma.\nQualified person\nKen Lapierre, PGeo, president and chief executive officer of the company, is a qualified person in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements as set out in National Instrument 43-101, and has reviewed and approved the scientific and technical information that forms the basis for the disclosure contained in this news release.\nAbout Rocky Shore Gold Ltd.\nRocky Shore Gold is a Canadian-based mineral exploration company focused on gold discoveries in central Newfoundland on its 100-per-cent-controlled Gold Anchor project. The district-scale underexplored grassroots project is the second-largest (greater than 1,200 square kilometres) property within an emerging Central gold district. It is strategically located on trend to major gold discoveries and recent gold deposits. Numerous gold-bearing faults are within the project limits including the highly prospective Appleton and JBP fault corridors. Rocky Shore also holds strategic gold projects within the Hemlo gold camp area. The projects at Hemlo include the Pic project (optioned to Barrick Gold Inc.) and the Idaho and North limb projects.\nRocky Shore Gold would like to acknowledge the financial support from the junior exploration assistance program from the Department of Natural Resources, government of Newfoundland and Labrador.\nWe seek Safe Harbor.\n© 2025 Canjex Publishing Ltd.
