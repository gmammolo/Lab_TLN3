  "text": "While cities like Atlanta, New York, Manitoba, New Orleans, and even the UK continue to siphon off large-scale productions from Hollywood, Illinois is proving it can compete—and win. Governor JB Pritzker today announced that film production expenditures in Illinois reached $653 million in 2024, the second-highest total in state history, generating an estimated $351 million in wages and 18,200 hires across the industry (excluding extras).\nIn the wake of Los Angeles’ first-quarter production numbers plunging more than 22%, Illinois is not just holding steady—it’s surging forward. Fueled by a strengthened tax credit program, a growing workforce training pipeline, and a series of buzzy film and TV projects—from FX’s The Bear to Netflix’s Monsters —the state is positioning itself as the next logical home for studios, writers’ rooms, and producers seeking a friendlier climate for production.\n“Through the Film and TV Workforce Program, we have invested in the future of the industry – increasing diversity and building out a qualified pipeline of hundreds who are equipped to serve on film crews and making it possible for us to attract major productions,” said Governor JB Pritzker . “Our success is a testament to our hard work and partnership as well as the undeniable charm of Illinois and our people that makes us a prime creative destination.”\nThat pipeline is anchored by the state’s Film and TV Workforce Training Program , a diversity-first initiative that’s trained over 200 crew members per year since its inception in 2022. Run through the Illinois Film Office and community partners like Free Spirit Media , the program is developing new talent across departments and ensuring local crew can compete with seasoned teams from L.A., New York, and beyond.\nThe results speak volumes. While TV production in L.A. dropped more than 30% in Q1 of 2025—according to FilmLA’s latest data—Chicago has continued to serve as the home base for NBC’s One Chicago universe, The Bear , and Power Book IV: Force . Projects like Apple TV+’s Dark Matter and HBO Max’s Somebody Somewhere are bringing in out-of-state dollars, employing local crews, and showcasing Illinois on the global stage. Even Sundance hit Ghostlight , produced by Eddie Linker, credited the state tax credit as the deciding factor in getting the film made.\nAt a time when L.A. productions are shrinking—squeezed by high costs, dwindling streaming budgets, and a post-strike hangover—Illinois’ 30% tax credit on qualified expenditures (with an added 15% bonus for hiring from economically disadvantaged areas) is giving producers a reason to set up shop in Chicago. Crucially, unlike many competing states, Illinois has no cap on its film tax credit, making it attractive to projects of all scales.\n“This is what happens when government supports the arts and the creative economy,” said Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton . “This didn’t happen by chance—it’s the result of deliberate policies, and it’s changing the narrative about where great storytelling happens.”\nNow, the opportunity is clear—and Chicago stakeholders are ready to seize it.\nAccording to FilmLA , 2024 saw the second-lowest year for L.A. TV filming in a decade, and 2025 has started worse. With backlot studio space gathering dust, the door is open for Chicago to expand not only as a location hub—but also as a home for full production ecosystems. That means attracting writers’ rooms, development teams, and even new soundstage infrastructure.\nStudio executives are listening. The Bear has proven that a gritty, urban Chicago backdrop can carry national prestige and Emmy hardware. Pair that with state-funded training programs, a deepening crew base, and smart producers ready to roll—and it’s not hard to envision Chicago as the next must-shoot destination.\n“We stand at the ready to work with the Governor, his team, and the General Assembly in growing the entertainment industry and contributing to the economic opportunities for our state and workforce,” said Tony Barracca, Business Manager for the Illinois Alliance of Theatrical State Employees Local 476.\nWith major productions like The Chi , Deli Boys , The Up and Comer , and Once Upon a Christmas Wish recently wrapping or launching in Illinois—and the state generating $6.81 in economic activity for every dollar spent on the credit—it’s becoming increasingly clear: the smart money is on Illinois.\n“It’s really hard to find financing for movies in the current environment,” said Eddie Linker , producer of “Ghostlight.” “The ability to use the Illinois Tax Credit at almost any budget level is often the difference between making a movie or hoping to make a movie.”\nWatch the full presentation below:\nALSO READ:\nAs Hollywood production declines, Chicago can rise",
