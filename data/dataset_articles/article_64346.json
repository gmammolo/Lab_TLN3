  "text": "MISSOURI — The Missouri House voted “Do Pass” on a new bill Tuesday that could increase the tax credit available for film and series productions in the state. According to House Bill 1499, the bill would combine the tax credit available for TV projects and movies each year. Missouri began offering a tax credit for movie and TV productions in 2023, which offered $8 million for film and, separately, another $8 million for series productions. If passed, the bill would combine the two tax credit pots, attracting bigger productions to the Show-Me State. In August 2023, Missouri introduced the Show MO Act, which ended a decade-long lapse since Missouri’s previous tax credit program, which expired in 2013. According to the Missouri Division of Tourism, more than 40 projects have been approved since the launch of the tax incentives, with many more expected in the upcoming years. To qualify for the tax credit, production companies must first apply with the state and prove financial support for their project, then undergo an independent audit to verify spending. Afterward, the state will conduct an additional audit to ensure funds were accurately used and the production fulfilled its commitments after filming takes place in Missouri.
