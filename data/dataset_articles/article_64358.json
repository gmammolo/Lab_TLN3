  "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump said negotiators made \"big progress” after a meeting with a Japanese delegation on Wednesday aimed at securing a deal that would avoid higher levies he has threatened against trading partners.\n\"A Great Honor to have just met with the Japanese Delegation on Trade. Big Progress,” Trump wrote in a post to his Truth Social network.\nTrump earlier in the day had said he would personally attend the talks, which were led by the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments. Japan’s economic revitalization minister Ryosei Akazawa arrived in Washington to conduct the negotiations.\nForeign capitals are racing to negotiate deals with the U.S. to avert high import taxes Trump imposed — and then quickly paused — on about 60 trading partners.\nThe negotiations with Japan are being closely watched, offering a test case for other nations uncertain over what concessions Trump will seek to extract in exchange for trade agreements.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said Japan, a military ally, will likely be prioritized as the U.S. deals with a flood of nations all looking to cut their own deals. Bessent has said he envisions reaching agreements with Japan and other military allies to develop a collective effort to apply economic pressure on China.",
