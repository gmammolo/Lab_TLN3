  "text": "e-Dossier to revolutionalise criminal tracking system\nIn a major leap towards smarter policing and efficient criminal investigation, police authorities have revealed that an e-Dossier, a state-of-the-art digital application designed to centralise and enhance the management of criminal records across jurisdictions, has been created. This criminal record application can only be accessed by a police officer.\nIt took about three to four months to digitise the criminal records. Apart from that, a senior police official has written to departments of Punjab and Haryana to provide their criminal records as well to integrate in the e-Dossier before a formal launch. Expected to be available in a few months, this will help officials keep tab on bad characters, thieves, snatchers and criminals associated with gangs in a respective area.\nAccording to a senior police official, “Because of porous borders, a crime is often committed in Mohali or Panchkula, and the criminal is apprehended in Chandigarh or vice-versa. So, the e-Dossier will be more helpful if it is exhaustive and includes criminal data from neighboring cities as well.”\nThe Modus Operandi (MO) Bureau, a unit under the control of the DSP (Crime) in Chandigarh Police, played a crucial role in digitising records of roughly 37,000 criminals.\nThe e-Dossier promises a seismic shift in how law enforcement agencies handle criminal data. At its core is the generation of a unique criminal ID for each offender, consolidating a wide range of data — from personal and physical characteristics to gang affiliations and crime histories — into a single, comprehensive profile.\nIn addition to storing multiple FIRs per individual, the platform creates a full network analysis of suspects, recording ties to sureties, associates, relatives and even receivers of stolen property.\nThe platform also supports real-time tracing, with dedicated entries for individuals who may assist in locating offenders and maintains records on proclaimed offenders and convictions. It incorporates a powerful, multi-parameter search engine that allows investigators to scout databases using facial recognition, names, arrest dates, crime types and more. This dramatically accelerates the identification process and enhances operational efficiency during critical investigations.",
