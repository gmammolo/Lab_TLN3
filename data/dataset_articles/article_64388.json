  "text": "L3Harris announces new high-tech facility in Fort Wayne to support U.S. defense\nFORT WAYNE, Ind. (WPTA) - L3Harris has opened its new payload manufacturing and integration facility, marking a significant step forward in the space-based missile defense and weather technology.\nLeaders say the facility is set to produce advanced payloads for U.S. defense systems.\nRob Mitrevski, Vice President of Spectral Solutions at L3Harris, says planning for this facility began years ago, with the idea that the Department of Defense needed a better way to protect the United States from emerging threats.\nAccording to L3Harris leaders, northeast Indiana has a rich history in high-tech manufacturing, and that was a major factor in choosing the location.\nRep. Marlin Stutzman (R), who represents Indiana’s 3rd district, attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony and expressed his excitement for not only the technology but also for protecting the United States.\nStutzman says the benefits this will have for the area are endless, with more than 600 potential new jobs.\nCopyright 2025 WPTA.
