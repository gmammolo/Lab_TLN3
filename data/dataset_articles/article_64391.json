  "text": "Trump declared \"great progress\" after meeting with Japanese delegation\nWASHINGTON, April 17th. /tass/. US President Donald Trump announced \"great progress\" after meeting with the Japanese delegation to discuss trade issues.\n\"It is a great honor to have just met with the Japanese delegation on trade issues. Great progress,\" he wrote on his page on the Truth Social network.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump wrote on a social network that negotiations between Washington and Tokyo on the issue of duties would take place on April 16. The owner of the White House indicated that he would personally take part in them. According to him, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Latnick are also participating in the negotiations from the American side.\nOn April 2, Trump announced the introduction of customs duties on products from 185 countries and territories. Tariffs of 24% have been approved for goods from Japan. In addition, since April 3, the US administration has imposed additional customs duties of 25% on all imported cars, which has also seriously affected Japanese interests.\nOn April 9, the owner of the White House announced that he was suspending the increase in duties for 75 countries that had shown willingness to negotiate for 90 days. For the time being, import tariffs of 10% will apply to them.",
