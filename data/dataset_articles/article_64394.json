  "text": "NEWPORT NEWS, Va. — Kia Bickham calls it \"working across differences.\" As the Director of Engagement for E Pluribus Unum , she's one of many attendees at the Hampton Roads Social Justice Conference. Bickham's organization equips communities across the South with the resources to bridge divides and foster connections. It's one of the many organization doing just that at the social justice conference hosted by Christopher Newport University. \"Across all spectrums of differences, different beliefs, ideologies, different topics of interest. You may have someone here interested in housing, another interested in economic mobility. How do they intersect and what does that look like?\" said Bickham. The conference aims to bring activists, organizations, scholars, community leaders and more together to learn from each other in pursuit of social justice and equity. That communication across sectors highlights the need to shared strategies, strategies that often times apply to shared root causes. Kenneth Hunter is an organizer for the Virginia Consensus for Higher Education in Prison . He's aiming to expand access to college education for people incarcerated. A speaker at the conference, he says the interconnectedness helps with solving a wide range of problems. \"Inequity permeates the same communities in the same way. If we look at the problems in that way, then we find ways to address it from its root, from its foundation,\" said Hunter. It's the fourth annual version of the event, and over 400 attendees will be present over the two-day conference.",
