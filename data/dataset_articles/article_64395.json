  "text": "A high-level delegation from across Parliament has reinforced New Zealand's enduring bonds to the Pacific over the past week, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters says.\n\"Our New Zealand Parliamentarians drawn from five political parties, across government and opposition, have spent time in Tonga, Hawaii, Fiji and Vanuatu connecting with our Pacific family,\" Mr Peters says.\n\"We live in challenging and uncertain times, and it is more important than ever that the Pacific works together towards a more secure, more prosperous and more resilient region.\n\"This visit has helped us to gain a fresh understanding of priorities from right across the region, in Polynesia, Melanesia and Micronesia - and what more New Zealand can do to help.\"\nPacific Peoples, Science & Innovation, and Universities Minister Dr Shane Reti says higher education helps drive prosperity and, in tumultuous times, engenders understanding and tolerance.\n\"We are working to ensure New Zealand's science, innovation and university sectors contribute to Pacific development for mutual benefit,\" says Dr Reti.\nClimate Change and Energy Minister, Simon Watts says New Zealand's Pacific neighbours are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\n\"We are committed to collaborating with Pacific nations to increase energy security to help deal with the effects of climate change,\" says Mr Watts.\nCourts Minister Nicole McKee says the delegation benefited from engaging with a broad range of Pacific counterparts.\n\"Forging new relationships and re-connecting with established partners has been productive for both the New Zealand delegation and our Pacific brethren,\" says Mrs McKee.\nThe other members of the delegation have been:\n- Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Carmel Sepuloni;\n- Chair of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee, Tim van de Molen;\n- Co-Chairs of the New Zealand-Pacific Interparliamentary Friendship Group, Teanau Tuiono and Jenny Salesa; and\n- Chair of the Transport and Infrastructure Committee, Andy Foster.\nThe delegation returns to New Zealand later today (17 April).\nhere.",
