This relationship is a partnership founded on mutual respect, not asymmetry,\" he said.\nHe also stressed that domestic reforms are guided by national priorities rather than external demands.\n\"Our reforms are not a response to EU requirements. They are a response to the needs of our citizens,\" Macut added.\nHe also reaffirmed Serbia's dedication to broad international cooperation, saying that the country will \"extend hands of cooperation to all\".\nMacut also addressed the Kosovo issue, calling it the highest national priority.\n\"We do not abandon our principles, but we do not reject dialogue. Peace is impossible without justice,\" he asserted.\nMacut's nomination follows the resignation of former Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, who stepped down on January 28 amid mounting tensions following the deadly canopy collapse at the Novi Sad railway station in November 2024, which resulted in 16 fatalities.\nThe National Assembly officially confirmed Vucevic's resignation on March 19.\n--IANS\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",
