  "text": "North Dakota Senate again passes $30 million incentive for large agricultural developments\nThe Senate had reconsidered and amended the bill to add an emergency clause to allow for the law to be potentially enacted sooner.\nGRAND FORKS — The North Dakota Senate again passed a $30 million incentive funding package for large agriculture developments Wednesday afternoon.\nThe Senate had originally passed the bill on March 26 but decided to reconsider the measure in order to give the Appropriations Committee the chance to further review it. On Wednesday, April 16, the Senate adopted an emergency amendment to the bill, meaning that if Gov. Kelly Armstrong signs the bill into law, it would go into effect immediately rather than in August, like most state laws do.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe bill seeks to give state incentives to large agricultural development and will likely be part of the incentive package for the Agristo development that is being planned for Grand Forks.\nThe Belgian potato processor announced its $450 million plan for its first American facility earlier this year, and\nthis incentive is just one of several planned, including tax incentives from the city.\nThis bill would allow the company to apply for a $30 million grant paid in two parts.\nThe first half would be given when a certificate of occupancy is issued, the rest when the facility has reached 50% of production capacity. The grant works on a reimbursement model and can be used for capital expenditures, infrastructure and site acquisition.\nTo fund the grant, the Bank of North Dakota will be able to extend a line of credit to the agriculture commissioner for grant awards from the Agricultural Diversification and Development Fund. The appropriation measure would\nonly be valid for the biennium that ends in June 2029.\nWith the amendments, it will go back to the House of Representatives for consideration; if it passes with the amendment, it would go directly to Armstrong. If the House doesn't adopt the amendments, it would go potentially go to a conference committee for further consideration.\nTo date, the bill has seen strong support from the Legislature. It passed Wednesday with a 45-5 vote in the Senate and previously passed in March on a 43-3 vote. The House passed the measure in February on an 82-8 vote. The bill has also seen strong support in its several committee hearings from both legislators and testifiers.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT",
