  "text": "D.C. and the Washington Commanders are close to a deal to build the team’s new home at the RFK Stadium site, according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive discussions. The deal is not yet official, those people said, and the contributions from each party are not finalized.\nThe potential agreement comes after months of talks between the administration of D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and the team, a process that gained significant momentum after D.C. gained control of the 174-acre waterfront RFK campus through an act of Congress in December. The move made possible a longtime dream of the mayor’s to redevelop the site — and potentially bring the football team back to where it played from 1961 until 1996. The news of an impending deal was first reported by Mark Segraves of NBC4.\nThe Commanders, who now play in Landover, Maryland, are expected to tap into the NFL’s stadium-loan program to finance a portion of their contribution, according to a person familiar with the situation. The NFL declined to comment. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has been actively involved in the talks, another person said.\nA spokesperson for Bowser declined to comment on the status of the administration’s discussions with the team.\nSkip to end of carousel\nthe Post Local newsletterto get local news, weather and expert advice — where to eat, where to drink and how to get around — every weekday.\nThe deal could appear in Bowser’s budget proposal for next fiscal year. Bowser is expected to unveil that proposal sometime in the next month, city officials said this week. She said Monday that her 2026 budget is “done” — but her administration has been waiting to release it because they will submit it to the D.C. Council along with a revised budget for this year that has been thrown into uncertainty by a $1 billion cut imposed by Congress.\nThe Congress-induced budget crisis has left D.C. officials with a $410 million shortfall to close between now and the end of the fiscal year in September, one that they are still hoping the House of Representatives will reverse when they return from recess at the end of the month. Still, Bowser announced this week that she must take immediate and “extraordinary measures” to cut costs in the meantime. Bowser on Tuesday issued an order freezing government hiring and directing her administration to come up with plans for potential furloughs of city employees and closures of government facilities.\nThe capital budget, which would be the source of city funds for the stadium, is separate from the operating budget that funds D.C. government agencies and services.\nBowser has said she envisions a stadium as one part of a multiuse development that would include housing, retail, a sportsplex for D.C. residents and green space.\nAny stadium deal involving public funds will have to get approval from the D.C. Council — where not every lawmaker supports financing a stadium with taxpayer money. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson has said he does not oppose a stadium itself but does not want public dollars paying for any part of it.\nMendelson (D) said this week that the council has “not been consulted or kept informed” about the negotiations with the Commanders. “I find it disturbing that the mayor believes a unilateral approach is the best course, especially when ultimately the council has to give approval,” he said.\nA group of activists has also launched a ballot initiative effort to block construction of a stadium at RFK, arguing the land would be best used for affordable housing instead of a stadium. Their initiative seeks to get a question on the ballot in next year’s local elections, allowing D.C. voters to decide whether they want to change zoning rules to prohibit any professional sports stadium from being built on the RFK campus.\nThis story is developing and will be updated.",
