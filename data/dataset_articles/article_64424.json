  "text": "Wisconsin squeaks past Minnesota for the top spot in voter turnout\n“In a heartbreakingly close contest, Minnesota lost the title of number one in voter turnout to Wisconsin for the 2024 election,” said Secretary of State Steve Simon\nST. PAUL — In the race between Gophers and Badgers for voter turnout, the Badgers won.\nVoters in Wisconsin narrowly outperformed Minnesota voters in the 2024 election. The University of Florida’s Election Lab\nreported\nthat 76.35% of the voting-eligible population cast ballots in Minnesota. In Wisconsin, 76.64% of the voting-eligible population cast ballots.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSecretary of State Steve Simon regularly touts Minnesota’s long-running first-place voter turnout position. And he said while turnout was strong in the 2024 general election, it came up just a little bit short.\n“In a heartbreakingly close contest, Minnesota lost the title of number one in voter turnout to Wisconsin for the 2024 election,” he said in a statement. “We congratulate our neighbors to the east on this victory and we’ll continue our work to earn the top spot back in 2026.”\nWisconsin was one of a handful of battleground states in last year’s presidential election. Campaigns spent tens of millions of dollars in Wisconsin, and voters sent a mixed message back by reelecting Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin.\nMinnesota stayed in the Democratic column. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won the presidential vote in Minnesota with Gov. Tim Walz on the ticket. DFL Sen. Amy Klobuchar easily defeated her Republican opponent.\nThis story was originally published on MPRNews.org\n_________________________________________________",
