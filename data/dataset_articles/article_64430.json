  "text": "The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom delivered a common sense ruling on the transgender debate, unanimously stating that a woman is someone born biologically female.\nAs a physician, I deal in biology—not ideology.\nThe UK Supreme Court just ruled what every doctor knows: a woman is defined by biology.\nYou can’t change your biological sex. Gender isn’t something you self-define.\nThis isn’t bigotry. It’s reality.\n[pic.twitter.com/Hn9SIPgeUo]\n— Dr. Simone Gold (@drsimonegold)\n[April 16, 2025] Fox News reports:\nTrans women can be excluded from some single-sex spaces and groups under the U.K. Equality Act, the five judges of the top court ruled. These spaces and groups include changing rooms, homeless shelters, swimming areas and medical or counseling services provided only to women.\nThe ruling means that even a transgender person with a certificate that recognizes them as female should not be considered a woman for equality purposes.\nBut Justice Patrick Hodge said its ruling “does not remove protection from trans people,” who are “protected from discrimination on the ground of gender reassignment.”\n“Interpreting ‘sex’ as certificated sex would cut across the definitions of ‘man’ and ‘woman’ … and, thus, the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way,” Hodge said. “It would create heterogeneous groupings.”\nWomen’s rights groups celebrated the ruling outside the court.\n🚨New: The UK Supreme Court has ruled trans women are not legally biological women\nCongratulations\n[@jk_rowling] [pic.twitter.com/VF4hYfFwoA]\n— The Calvin Coolidge Project (@TheCalvinCooli1)\n[April 16, 2025]\nWATCH:\nUK Supreme Court just ruled that law defines women as people born biologically female.\nThis is a huge win for women, men, and sanity in the UK and the West.\nNow every country needs to get onboard and recognize in law what is a woman.\nCongratulations to UK women!\n[pic.twitter.com/nJU0zQvIgl]\n— Paul A. Szypula 🇺🇸 (@Bubblebathgirl)\n[April 16, 2025]\nPer\nBBC:\nThe court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female.\nJudge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.\nThe Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women.\nThe Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain.\nLord Hodge said the central question was how the words “woman” and “sex” are defined in the legislation.\nHe told the court: “The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex.\n“But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not.”\nHe added that the legislation gives transgender people “protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender”.",
