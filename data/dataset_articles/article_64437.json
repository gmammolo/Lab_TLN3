Their collective work has made a difference in the health, safety and quality of life of families and individuals across Pennsylvania. They are committed to making our Commonwealth a place where everyone can live, work, and thrive, and we are proud to recognize them for their dedication and excellence.”\nThe annual awards ceremony coincides with Pennsylvania Local Government Day, which focuses attention on the need for strong, independent, and active local government in the Commonwealth and celebrates the valuable contributions made by residents serving their communities.\n“In this moment – when it feels like the very concept of public service is under attack – it’s important to celebrate the dedicated individuals who are working, day in and day out, at the local level to make Pennsylvania’s communities safer, healthier and more vibrant,” said Lt. Gov. Austin Davis. “The Shapiro-Davis Administration salutes this year’s award recipients and thanks them for ‘getting stuff done’ for the good people of Pennsylvania.”\nDCED’s Governor’s Center for Local Government Services sponsors Local Government Day annually to honor local governments and officials who serve their communities and improve their quality of life.\nDetailed information about this year’s recipients can be found on DCED’s website .\nThe following local government officials were recognized:\nDennis R.
