  "text": "(The Center Square) - Arizona legislators are excited about a new law to address cellphone distractions among students during class time. House Bill 2484 , which Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed this week, was introduced by Rep. Beverly Pingerelli, R-District 21. Pingerelli called the law a necessary step to bring back discipline in classrooms and restore academic focus. “Education requires attention, and attention is exactly what today’s students are being robbed of by addictive devices and endless scrolling,” Pingerelli said in a press release . “We’ve drawn a clear line: Arizona classrooms are for learning, not TikTok.” Sen. Shawnna Bolick, R-District 20, introduced a bill similar to the one that became law. “She took some provisions from my bill. I took some provisions from hers, and hopefully in two more years when we have a Republican governor, I would like to see a stronger policy in place, but I think this is a good first step,” Bolick, expressing optimism for her party in the 2026 election, told The Center Square. The law requires a public meeting for school districts to produce a policy. Schools that already have a policy are not expected to go back and make changes. “In my opinion, having two kids who are now 20 and 23, I know each of their schools have their own policy when it came to cellphone use during class time,” said Bolick, who previously sat on different charter school boards. “My son’s school did not permit cellphones at all during the school day. My daughter could basically text me all day if I had wanted her to, which I did not do because I'm not a helicopter parent. But there are unfortunately some parents out there that want to track their kids all day long in school.” Much like a student playing games, calling or texting frequently on a phone can be a distraction for teachers who are already battling for the students’ attention in class, Bolick said. One parent recently informed Bolick that she is leaving the education profession after a male student threw his I-pad at her. “She told me that she was starting a new job outside the school system because her administrators didn't even discipline the kid for throwing his device at her,” said Bolick. She added that cellphones have become like a addictive drug. Pingerelli also has teachers in mind with this law. “Teachers shouldn’t have to compete with YouTube and Instagram to be heard,” said Pingerelli. “HB2484 refocuses kids on learning, empowering parents and backing up teachers.” Pointing to studies out of London and Pew Research, Bolick said policies to cut down on cellphone distractions will help improve test scores. As a result, Bolick recommended other states should follow Arizona in passing similar legislation. “We’re considered a highly industrialized countries, and we are falling far behind. And that's not a good thing,” said Bolick.",
