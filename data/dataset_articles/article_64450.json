  "text": "SHILLONG, April 16: The State BJP will now move beyond mere issue-raising and take concrete action against any political entity, be it ally or opponent, provided a formal complaint is lodged.\nState BJP general secretary Wankitbok Pohshna emphasised that without an official complaint, the party has no mandate to initiate inquiries, whether against its own partners or the opposition.\nHe urged citizens to submit complaints either to the BJP or to the appropriate authorities, assuring that every allegation would be thoroughly examined and pursued with diligence.\nCiting the National Herald case as an example, Pohshna noted that the case advanced only after a public interest complaint was filed in 2012, and it has since progressed through the legal system. “Any matter brought before us with the requisite documentation will be taken to its logical conclusion,” he asserted.\nResponding to recent allegations of illegal coal mining, Pohshna revealed that the BJP has already formed a fact-finding committee to investigate the matter.\nOutlining the party’s internal processes, he said BJP offices across the state are equipped to receive public representations and will coordinate with district administrations and law enforcement agencies as necessary.\nEarlier, Pohshna had levelled a series of accusations against the Congress, alleging that its leadership is attempting to distract the public with protests and outrage over minor issues while more serious scandals are unfolding.\nHe reminded reporters that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, are named in the National Herald charge sheet, which he said details a clear paper trail of questionable transactions and asset misuse.\nPohshna further claimed that properties of Associated Journals Limited (AJL), which were originally owned by thousands of freedom-fighter shareholders since 1937, were fraudulently transferred into private hands. He alleged that assets worth over Rs 5,000 crore are now controlled by a single family, calling it “a betrayal of the founding shareholders and the nation’s trust.”\nHe concluded by directly challenging the Congress: “With so much evidence now public, how can it continue to pose as the standard-bearer of Gandhian truth?”",
