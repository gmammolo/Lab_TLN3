  "text": "Law makers working to designate a portion of Highway 90 in honor of Deputy May\nPANAMA CITY, Fla. (WJHG/WECP) - A portion of Highway 90 in Walton County will soon be designated as Deputy William May Memorial Highway.\nFlorida Senator Jay Trumbull said on Thursday that the legislature will be introducing an amendment to designate a roadway to honor Deputy May.\n“This is a small but meaningful way we can recognize Deputy May’s incredible service and sacrifice. We remain hopeful for continued support from both the Senate and House as we work to advance this tribute to the Governor’s desk—honoring Deputy May’s legacy in the community he gave his life to protect,” said Trumbull.\nTo stay up to date on all the latest news as it develops, follow WJHG on Facebook, Instagram and X (Twitter).\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction?
