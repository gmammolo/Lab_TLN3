  "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Tennessee lawmakers have approved the state's budget for the 2025-2026 fiscal year, planning to spend around $7 billion more than the previous year. The latest spending plan comes in at around $59.8 billion.\nLawmakers said the spending plan recognizes a 2% growth rate and shifts around $19.94 million in funds originally slated to be recurring to be nonrecurring, giving the state more leverage to manage or cut some long-term spending.\nA release from lawmakers said the\nstate budget would create a $42.5 million nonrecurring grant pool aimed at supporting community services. That pool has $20 million in funding for volunteer fire departments, $5 million for rescue squads and $5 million for emergency medical services. Funding is also available for senior centers, museums and courthouse restorations.\nThe pool also sets aside $500,000 for the Second Harvest Food Bank of East Tennessee, which said in late March that federal departments had\ncanceled 21 tractor-trailers of food, valued at around $722,200.\nThe budget also provides $26 million in nonrecurring funds for survivors of Hurricane Helene, and $20 million set aside for a match to federal disaster relief efforts.\nIt also sets aside $145.9 million to\nfund universal school vouchers, a controversial proposal that was passed during a special legislative session earlier in the year. The program allows families to apply for vouchers of more than $7,000 in public funds to be spent on private school costs. Critics of the program said it moves funds away from already underfunded public schools.\nA release from lawmakers also said the budget sets aside $62.7 million for primary and secondary school infrastructure, as well as an extra $244 million for public school funding through the state's Tennessee Investment in Student Achievement formula.\nThe budget sets aside $500,000 in one-time funds for the University of Tennessee Law Enforcement Innovation Center, and $400,000 for the East Tennessee Regional Forensic Facility and Training Program.\nThe University of Tennessee System's campuses are expected to get around $930 million from the state, and more than a third of those funds will go towards its Knoxville campus. Around another $11.3 million will go to the UT Space Institute, and $5.8 million will go towards the university system's research initiatives. The school's veterinary medicine program will get around $35.7 million, and its agricultural extension service is expected to receive around $53.1 million.\nThe Tennessee Department of Health is slated to get around $368 million, and its Department of Human Services is set to get around $307.4 million. The Tennessee Department of Military will get around $42.1 million, and the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services will get around $436.5 million.\nThe spending plan also moves $35.6 million into the state's \"Rainy Day Fund,\" bringing that fund to nearly $2.2 billion in total and making it the largest in state history, according to the release.\nAhead of the vote, Democratic lawmakers asked the state's Department of Finance about how Tennessee could be impacted by federal cuts, saying that federal funds made up about 41.9% of the previous year's budget. Lawmakers said they wanted to understand the scope that federal cuts could have, so families would not \"bear the burden of federal instability.\"\nInformation about the extent of federal funding in this year's budget proposal was not immediately available.",
