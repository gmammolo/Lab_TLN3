  "text": "HONOLULU – Mayor Rick Blangiardi today announced the appointment of Dr. Randal A. Collins, CEM, as the new Director of the City and County of Honolulu’s Department of Emergency Management (DEM). Dr. Collins brings decades of experience in emergency management, crisis response, and strategic leadership. Acting Director Jennifer Walter will remain with the department as Deputy Director, ensuring continuity and stability in leadership.\n“We are thrilled to welcome Randy Collins to our team,” said Mayor Blangiardi. “His extensive background in emergency management, leadership development, and crisis response will be invaluable as we continue to enhance O‘ahu’s preparedness and resilience. I am also grateful to Jennifer Walter for her leadership as Acting Director and am pleased that she will continue to serve in a key role.”\nDr. Collins has an impressive career spanning multiple sectors, including government, academia, and private industry. He most recently served as the Emergency Management Senior Director for the NEOM Project in Saudi Arabia, where he led strategic crisis management initiatives and established NEOM’s first Weather Service. He is also the President and CEO of the Incident Management Teams Association, working closely with FEMA and NEMA to develop national emergency management programs.\nIn addition to his field experience, Dr. Collins is an Associate Adjunct Professor of Emergency Management at the University of Southern California, where he teaches and develops graduate-level courses. He has held key leadership roles, including Emergency Management Coordinator for the City of El Segundo, National Director of American Humane Rescue, and Deputy Director of Operations and Preparedness for Indianapolis-Marion County Emergency Management.\nAs a certified emergency manager, he has led responses to major disasters, including Hurricane Sandy and significant tornado outbreaks. With over 30 federally declared disaster responses, he has built a reputation for strategic decision-making, interagency coordination, and implementing innovative solutions to complex challenges.\n“I am deeply grateful to Mayor Blangiardi for this opportunity to serve the City and County of Honolulu in such a critical role,” said Dr. Collins. “Emergency management is about staying ahead of the next challenge—bringing together the best ideas, the best people, and the best strategies to protect the lives, livelihoods, and the quality of life of the people of Honolulu. I look forward to building strong partnerships and modernizing how we prepare for, respond to, and cope with emergencies.”\nDr. Collins, a former Staff Sergeant in the Marine Corps, holds a Doctor of Education in Organizational Change and Leadership and a Master of Leadership from the University of Southern California, as well as a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice from the University of Indianapolis.\nHis first day in his new role will be Thursday, May 1, 2025.\n—PAU—",
