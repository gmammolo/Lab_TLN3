  "text": "Ayotte cites new bail law as top achievement in first 100 days\nGovernor says she will work with Senate to restore budget priorities\nGovernor says she will work with Senate to restore budget priorities\nGovernor says she will work with Senate to restore budget priorities\nGov. Kelly Ayotte will mark 100 days in office this weekend, and she said she is proud of her achievements while noting that she's not on board with some of the deep budget cuts proposed by House lawmakers.\nAyotte said that one major achievement she can point to in her first 100 days is the repeal of the 2018 bail law that made it much easier for suspects to avoid jail after arrest.\n\"If you're a multiple offender, the presumption is that you're going to be held, and if you've skipped out on bail before, there's going to be much stronger consequences for that,\" Ayotte said.\nIn a one-on-one interview with News 9, Ayotte said her top priority right now is the state budget. She proposed belt-tightening in February, but she will be working with the state Senate to restore much of what was in her budget, including top priorities such as mental health funding, which was cut by House Republicans, citing inadequate funds.\n>> Download the free WMUR app to get updates on the go: Apple | Google Play <<\n\"I can tell you that after the House passed the budget, the way that I put our revenue estimates together, with the head of the Department of Revenue Administration Commissioner Stepp along with the state's chief economist, Brian Gottlob, to get their best opinion on where revenue would be for the next biennium. That is what was contained in my budget,\" Ayotte said. \"After I looked at the House revenue estimates that were passed, I met with them again, and I asked them, 'Was I right? Where are we?' And I can tell you that they believe that the estimates that the House used are too low.\"\nTariffs are unsettling markets and increasing costs for some New Hampshire businesses. Ayotte said she still trusts that President Donald Trump will be able to strike a better deal.\n\"My hope is there will be a resolution of this, that there will be certainty, and we will work this out in a way that is good for New Hampshire,\" she said.",
