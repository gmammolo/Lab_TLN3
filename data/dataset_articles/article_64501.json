  "text": "(The Center Square) - “Reba’s Law,” a bill which would increase animal cruelty punishments, has been revived after it appeared dead in the state Assembly. The legislation is named after the infamous case of Reba, the bulldog who died after being trapped in a discarded plastic bin on a hot day in Las Vegas last summer. Assembly Bill 381 never advanced after its introduction in March, but was granted a waiver to extend the deadline for the animal cruelty bill. The Assembly Judiciary Committee voted Monday to move along Reba’s Law. It is still undecided when it will be voted on by the state Senate. “To be the voice for the voiceless,” said Assemblymember Melissa Hardy, R-Clark County, at the Assembly Judiciary Committee hearing. “Those that are harmed, abused and killed, that can't speak for themselves. ... Although we can't bring her (Reba) back, this will hopefully provide accountability and save other animals that won't have to suffer as she did.” The bill would increase punishment of animal cruelty that resulted in an animal’s death to a category B felony, from a category D. First-time violators would be punishable by one to 10 years in prison, up from the current four-year maximum. Violators also face a potential fine of up to $10,000. Reba’s Law also expands the definition of animal cruelty and torture to “every act, omission or neglect, whereby unjustifiable physical pain, suffering or death is caused, allowed or permitted.\" Knowing of animal cruelty or torture without an effort to stop it would also be punishable. “We agree that those convicted of animal cruelty should be held accountable as Assembly Bill 381 ensures,” wrote the American Kennel Club to the Assembly Judiciary. “Well-written animal cruelty laws ensure the protection for both animals and responsible animal owners.” The Animal Legal Defense Fund ranked Nevada in the bottom half, 31, for state animal protection laws. The Nevada Voters for Animals also agreed with the Assembly Judiciary’s vote, but expressed concern about its focus. “A law is just ink on paper unless and until it’s enforced,” wrote the organization’s President Gina Greisen. “I pray the proper resources and priority can be put behind the many heinous animal cruelty crimes occurring in Nevada.”",
