  "text": "Butte, Mont. - April 16, 2025 - Colstrip Plant owners NorthWestern Energy and Talen Energy express their gratitude to Montana's Governor Greg Gianforte, U.S. Senators Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, U.S. Representatives Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and the federal administration for the proclamation granting two years of relief from a new Environmental Protection Agency rule. This relief is crucial for the future of Montana's power generation resource, which ensures reliable energy service in all weather conditions.\n\"Energy policies that consider energy reliability and energy bill impacts are in the best interest of Montana and the nation,\" said Talen Montana President Dale Lebsack. \"We are thankful for the recognition of these important factors.\"\nTalen Energy President and CEO Mac McFarland added, \"We greatly appreciate the engagement by the Governor, the Montana delegation, and the federal administration. Their support for Colstrip makes a significant difference and is helping to ensure reliable and reasonably priced power is available to Montana citizens.\"\n\"This relief means our Montana customers will not be burdened with hundreds of millions of dollars of costs to comply with a new regulation that would only marginally increase the Colstrip Plant's air toxics efficiency,\" said NorthWestern Energy President and CEO Brian Bird. \"The Colstrip Plant is a vital part of our balanced generation portfolio, providing reliable power to Montana customers at reasonable costs.\"\nThe Colstrip Plant is 99.6% efficient in reducing air toxics emissions. The new rule would improve air toxics emissions to 99.8% efficient.\nToday, the Colstrip Plant meets both federal and Montana's more stringent mercury standards, as well as the revised mercury standards set by the new EPA rule.\nThe executive proclamation allows the Colstrip Plant's owners time to effectively evaluate options for compliance with new air toxics standards and provides the federal government time to review the new EPA rule and assess its potential consequences for reliable energy service.\n\"We appreciate the state and federal administrations' support in ensuring that energy reliability and affordability remain a priority\", said Bird and Lebsack. \"Working together, we can deliver an energy grid - and an energy future - that is affordable, weather-resilient, responsive, and ready for the demand arriving now.\"\nNorthWestern Energy - Delivering a Bright Future\nNorthWestern Energy, provides essential energy infrastructure and valuable services that enrich lives and empower communities while serving as long-term partners to our customers and communities.
