  "text": "As 4/20 approaches, the cannabis world is gearing up for its biggest day of the year—sales, activations, and a flood of brand promotions across every platform. But behind all the flashy marketing campaigns and loud dispensary rollouts, there’s a more important conversation brewing: who are you really supporting when you buy weed this 4/20?\nIn an industry that’s still figuring itself out, small batch craft cannabis brands are fighting for survival—and your support could make all the difference. These are the people who grow, trim, and package with care. The ones who aren’t backed by billion-dollar hedge funds or global conglomerates. They’re Black-owned, woman-owned, veteran-owned, family-run, and community-driven. And unlike the big guys, they actually give a damn.\nThe Corporate Machine Has Entered the Chat\nLet’s be honest: the major players—Multi-State Operators (MSOs), Regional Operators (ROs), and their faceless house brands—are everywhere. They’re muscling into every market with slick packaging and low prices that often come at the cost of quality, ethics, and employee well-being.\nThese companies churn out weed like it’s fast fashion. Grown at scale, packaged in bulk, and sold as a commodity with no real story behind it. It’s weed made for margins, not for people. And in most cases, it smokes like it—dry, dull, and uninspired. If you’ve ever lit up something that looked good but hit like cardboard? That’s the corporate cannabis experience.\nOn the other side of that equation are small batch craft brands. These are producers who treat cannabis as an art form and a livelihood—not just a product to be scaled. They’re making careful decisions about genetics, cultivation practices, curing processes, and flavor profiles. And they’re doing it all while navigating impossible regulations, inconsistent supply chains, and razor-thin margins.\nWhy Small Batch Matters\nSupporting small batch cannabis isn’t just about charity—it’s about better weed. These brands aren’t chasing mass production. They’re obsessed with quality, effect, and consumer experience. Their batches are smaller because their standards are higher.\nWhen you buy from small producers, you’re also often getting:\n-\nProperly flushed and cured flower that burns clean\n-\nUnique genetics that aren’t part of a soulless house brand portfolio\n-\nReal terpene profiles that weren’t stripped out for the sake of volume\n-\nPeople behind the product who live in and support your community\nThis is the kind of weed that’s crafted—not manufactured. And you feel the difference every time you spark up.\nOwnership Still Matters in Cannabis\nDespite all the legalization wins over the last few years, cannabis is still overwhelmingly owned and controlled by people who weren’t harmed by prohibition. That needs to change.\nEvery time you choose a craft brand that’s Black-owned, veteran-owned, woman-owned, immigrant-owned, or family-run, you’re helping to shift the power dynamic in this industry. These operators usually don’t have the same access to capital, media, or shelf space—but they’re out here doing the hard work. They show up. They hire from within the community. They reinvest in their people.\nOwnership matters. Especially when the industry is being flooded with the same corporate actors who once lobbied to keep it illegal.\n4/20 Is the Perfect Time to Rethink Your Support\nIf you’re someone who really cares about cannabis—where it comes from, who grows it, how it’s treated—then 4/20 should be about more than catching a deal or grabbing a novelty item. It should be a moment of intention.\nAsk yourself:\n-\nWho’s getting your money?\n-\nAre they producing something meaningful?\n-\nAre they part of the solution or part of the problem?\nIf you want to support small batch, there are plenty of ways to do it this 4/20:\n-\nLook up the story behind the brand before buying\n-\nFollow independent growers and producers on social media\n-\nAttend community events and meet-the-maker sessions\n-\nAsk your local shop to carry more craft brands\n-\nTalk to your budtender about who’s actually making the products\n-\nShare the love. Word of mouth still matters\nAnd maybe most importantly—tip your budtender. They’re often the only connection between consumers and the people who actually make the product. A good budtender can steer someone toward a small batch brand just by sharing their knowledge. Appreciate that.\nStop Chasing Gimmicks. Start Backing Real Ones.\nThe cannabis industry is full of trends. Drinks are booming. Edibles are evolving. Vapes are everywhere. But through it all, the heart of this culture has always been the grower, the maker, the person who gives a damn about the plant.\nThis 4/20, skip the flashy promo drops and the house brand “discounts.” Look for the brands that are doing it for real—because they love the plant, not just the profit. The ones that are part of your community. The ones making small batches with big vision.\nThat’s how you keep cannabis from turning into just another soulless industry. That’s how you make your high mean something.\nThis 4/20, support people—not corporations.",
