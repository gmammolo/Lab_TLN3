  "text": "Defending champions Real Madrid are out of the Champions League after a 2-1 home defeat to Arsenal, while Inter Milan confirmed their spot in the semi-finals with a 2-2 draw with Bayern Munich on Wednesday. Arsenal will now face Paris Saint-Germain, while Inter will have Barcelona on their way to the final. Arsenal had a 3-0 advantage from the first leg and Bukayo Saka made up for a missed penalty in the first half to give them a 1-0 lead in the 65th minute. Vinicius Junior pulled one back just two minutes later, but Arsenal secured they would continue in the competition when Gabriel Martinelli scored the winner in stoppage time. Bayern were down 2-1 after the first leg, but levelled the tie in the 52nd through Harry Kane. But Inter turned the game around with Lautaro Martinez and former Bayern player Benjamin Pavard. Eric Dier gave Bayern a spark of hope in the 76th, but despite a huge late pressure, the Germans fell one goal short of taking the game to extra-time.",
