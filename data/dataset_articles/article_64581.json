  "text": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill (WICS) — New legislation could ban the use of harmful chemicals in firefighter gear.\nFirefighters said while they're braving dangerous conditions...\nHaving safe equipment means one less thing to worry about.\nYou might've heard the term PFAS before--also called forever chemicals. Studies said they could increase cancer risk.\n\"PFAS, or forever chemicals, were actually abundant in our bunker gear--and by bunker gear I mean the coat, the pants, the boots, the gloves, the helmet, that we wear every day,” Chuck Sullivan said.\nPresident of Associated Fire Fighters of Illinois Chuck Sullivan said the same equipment meant to keep firefighters safe, could be making them sick.\n\"The leading cause of death for firefighters today is cancer. It's not heart disease, it's not stroke, it's not building collapse, it's not burn injuries. It's cancer. And it's literally killing us,” Sullivan said.\nJim Keiken, the director of Illinois Fire Service Institute, says PFAS have been linked with thyroid disease, reproductive problems--and cancer.\nBut he said the jury's still out on if forever chemicals are to blame for a high cancer incidence among firefighters.\n\"As a firefighter, am I exposed from the A-triple-F like the commercial says, is it because my turnout gear is on my body and I'm hot and sweaty, or is it being released in the fire that I'm going in to extinguish?” Keiken said.\nKeiken said the Illinois Fire Service Institute is currently launching a 30-year study to break down the potential causes of high cancer incidence among firefighters. Through that study, they're also travelling across Illinois to reach volunteer firefighters and smaller departments.\nSome fire stations, like the Springfield Fire Department, are already making the switch to pfas-free gear.\n\"We have close to 75 sets of PFAS-free gear for the 200 members on the job. Over the next couple--two years--we should probably be at the point where most of the department has PFAS free gear. We don't want our firefighters to have to worry about getting cancer,” Fire Chief Ed Canny with the Springfield Fire Department said.\nSullivan said braving dangerous conditions are part of a firefighter's oath...\n\"We understand the risks of firefighting. We understand we're going to, on a daily basis, encounter carcinogenic and toxic chemicals. That's just the nature of our job. Completely understand that, and accept that. But when our bunker gear actually contains PFAS, we have an issue with that,” Sullivan said.\nPFAS are water and oil resistant, making them a common component of firefighting gear.\nOne study said PFAS-free equipment isn't as effective as its predecessor at repelling oil.\nWhich could present a danger to firefighters.\nBut at the Illinois Fire Service Institute, the gear will go through rigorous training.\n\"Our instructors are going to put that turnout gear through maybe 5-10 years of wear in the next year because of the amount of training that we do with it,” Keiken, director of the IFSI said.\nKeiken said so far the results are promising...\nKeiken said dependent on the next year, firefighters will have a better idea of how effective the new gear is.\nRight now, PFAS-free gear does cost firefighters more money.\nPFAS-free gear does meet regulatory standards. Some fire departments, including Springfield, have already made the switch to PFAS-free equipment.\nThe new legislation would require companies to stop selling gear containing forever chemicals by January 1, 2027.\nThe Illinois House passed the bill unanimously...and its next stop is the Senate floor.",
