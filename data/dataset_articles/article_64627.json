  "text": "TIMONIUM, Md. — On Wednesday, WMAR-2 News was out at Meadowood Regional Park, in partnership with Weis Markets and Leveling the Playing Field, to collect sports equipment for youth sports programs in need.\nAnd thanks to you, it wasn't just a good day at the park, it was a great day.\nThousands of dollars worth of equipment was donated today to benefit youth sports.\nNow, if you couldn't make it out today to donate, there is still a chance for you to help out.\nLeveling the Playing Field has bins located all around Baltimore City and County.\nYou can click here to find out where those bins are located.\nBut for now, from WMAR, Weis Markets, and Leveling the Playing Field, thank you for your donations and support.",
