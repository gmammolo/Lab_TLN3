  "text": "New electric aggregation provider approved for Twin Cities\nBLOOMINGTON-NORMAL (25News Now) - A new electric aggregation program supplier will be available in the Twin Cities.\nConstellation NewEnergy, Inc. was approved by both the City of Bloomington and the Town of Normal after a busy bidding process.\nThe new rate will be 11 cents per kilowatt-hour, up four cents from the current contract. Nationwide market corrections were cited as the reasons for the hike.\nLetters from Constellation and Ameren will be sent to residents informing them of the rate change.\nCustomers can opt out of the program free of charge until May 7. If no action is taken, they will be automatically enrolled into the program.\nConstellation will take over from the current supplier, Homefield Energy, in June and will run for the next year.\nYou can watch 25News - any newscast, anywhere - streaming LIVE on 25NewsNow.com, our 25News mobile app, and on our WEEK 25News SmartTV streaming app. Learn more about how you can get connected to 25News streaming live news here.\nCopyright 2025 WEEK.
