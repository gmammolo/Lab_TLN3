  "text": "Family First welcomes the unanimous decision of the British Supreme court to recognise the true definition of woman in law and urges Peter Dutton and Anthony Albanese to immediately do the same.\nQueensland lead Senate candidate Katie Lush said both the Coalition and Labor go into the May 3 election pledged to retain Australia’s farcical definition of woman in the Sex Discrimination Act.\n“It should not have taken UK women’s groups seven years of litigation to get a court to state the obvious,” Ms Lush said.\n“Peter Dutton and Anthony Albanese should not continue to put Australian women through the indignity of having to share their private spaces with biological males and have them make their sport unfair.\n“Girls’ and women’s rights advocates Kirralie Smith and Sal Grover are fighting expensive legal battles against biological males who want to invade women’s spaces because Labor and the Coalition refuse to fix the Sex Discrimination Act.”\nFamily First is fielding 100 candidates at this election, the sixth largest of any party.\n“Each candidate knows what a woman is and is prepared to fight for the truth if elected,” Ms Lush said.",
