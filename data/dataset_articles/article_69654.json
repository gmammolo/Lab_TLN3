  "text": "Jamia Masjid Sealed On Shab Barat: Auqaf Srinagar- The authorities have disallowed the congregational night prayers at Srinagar’s historic grand mosque on Shab-e-Baraat, one of the holiest nights in the Islamic calendar. The police also put Mirwaiz Umar Farooq under house detention.\nAnjuman Auqaf Jamia Masjid has expressed profound disappointment over this decision and strongly condemned these repressive measures. Anjuman Auqaf said that following Asr prayers, authorities abruptly closed the gates of Jama Masjid Srinagar, while police personnel asked worshippers to vacate the mosque premises.\nThe Auqaf was further informed that the observance of Shab-e-Baraat would not be permitted at the Jama Masjid.\nTerming the ban a repressive measure, the Anjuman Auqaf said, “It is deeply unfortunate that every time an important religious occasion arrives, people in large numbers who visit the Jama Masjid are left disappointed to find the grand mosque forcibly closed and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq barred from fulfilling his religious responsibilities. Such repeated restrictions not only hurt the sentiments of the people but also infringe upon their fundamental religious rights.”\nChief Minister Omar Abdullah called the restrictions at the grand mosque “unfortunate” and said they indicate a “lack of confidence in law and order machinery.”\n“It is very unfortunate that the security establishment has taken the decision to seal the historic Jamia Masjid, Srinagar, on one of the holiest nights in the Islamic calendar – Shab-e-Baraat. This decision betrays a lack in confidence in the people and a lack of confidence in the law and order machinery that calm won’t prevail without extreme measures. The people of Srinagar deserved better,” he posted on X.\nNotably, this is the sixth consecutive year that police have not allowed Shab-e-Baraat prayers at the Jamia Masjid. The prayers have been stopped since 2019.\nChief Minister Omar Abdullah called the sealing of Jamia Masjid on Shabe Baraat unfortunate and lack of confidence in the law & order machinery.\n“It is very unfortunate that the security establishment has taken the decision to seal the historic Jamia Masjid, Srinagar on one of the holiest nights in the Islamic calendar – #shabebaraat. This decision betrays a lack in confidence in the people & a lack of confidence in the law & order machinery that calm won’t prevail without extreme measures. The people of Srinagar deserved better,” Chief Minister Omar Abdullah wrote on X.",
