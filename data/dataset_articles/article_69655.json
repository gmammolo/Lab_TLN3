  "text": "PAS president Tan Sri Abdul Hadi Awang stepped back into the ‘Allah’ word controversy, this time saying ‘kafirs’ using the word in ‘mistranslations’ may mislead Muslims.\nHe explained that the word Allah carries a profound and comprehensive meaning that cannot be accurately translated into other languages.\nHe also explained that while non-Muslims may use the term, their usage often does not align with its true meaning and misusing the word, particularly in religious contexts like Bible translations, could mislead Muslims and must be prohibited.\nHadi explained that the word Allah cannot be translated into a single word in other languages because no term can convey its precise meaning.\n“There is no other language that can translate the word Allah. It cannot be done. Allah means God. But ‘God’ can refer to many things – idolaters appoint stones and other objects as their gods.\n“Allah has no other deity. So how can it be translated? ‘God’? ‘Hudaya’ in Persian? What? It cannot be done – it does not fit. The word Allah must remain,” he said.\n“The non-believers also say Allah. But when they say it, their pronunciation is incorrect. It does not align with the true meaning. We cannot stop them, we cannot silence them. But the misuse of the word Allah – that is not allowed,” he stressed.\nTherefore, he emphasised that prohibiting the misuse of the word Allah must be enforced to prevent confusion and the distortion of Islamic beliefs.\n“That is why there is a prohibition – it cannot be used recklessly. If non-believers misuse it, we must oppose it. They use it to deceive, to mislead Muslims.\n“They translate the word ‘God’ in the Bible, in altered scriptures, as Allah. The intention is to mislead Muslims, especially Malays – to make them think it is the same God, when in reality, it is a different appointed god, with other deities. That is wrong,” he added.\n“But we cannot completely prohibit non-believers from using it. What can we do? If they say it, they are wrong. If they say it, they sin; if we say Allah, we are rewarded.\nMain photo credit: Borneo Post Online",
