  "text": "CNN — The Vatican says it is unclear how long Pope Francis will stay in hospital and he will not lead Sunday’s Angelus prayer after he was admitted on Friday with a respiratory tract infection.\nThe 88-year-old was admitted to Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome for treatment for bronchitis – the latest in a string of ailments that have raised concerns about his health.\n“Pope Francis rested all night. He doesn’t have symptoms of fever. Tests performed during the day confirmed the respiratory tract infection. Therapy was slightly modified based on further microbiological findings. Today’s laboratory tests found improvement in some values,” the Vatican said in a statement Saturday.\n“The medical staff prescribed absolute rest; therefore, on tomorrow, Sunday, Feb. 16, the Holy Father will not lead the Angelus prayer; nevertheless, he intends to send the text for its publication,” the Vatican added.\nThe Vatican said Friday that the pope was at the medical facility “for some necessary diagnostic tests and to continue in a hospital setting treatment for bronchitis that is still ongoing.”\nThey later confirmed he was in the facility, and that he had canceled his meetings for the next three days.\nFrancis has made a number of visits to the hospital in recent years, and received abdominal surgery in 2023.\nHe has been struggling with bronchitis in recent weeks and has asked aides to read speeches and addresses.\nBut he held audiences at the Vatican on Friday morning before his hospitalization, including with the prime minister of Slovakia and with Mark Thompson, the chief executive of CNN.\nThe pope was mentally alert at the meeting but struggling to speak for extended periods due to breathing difficulties.\nOn Saturday morning he received Holy Eucharist, then alternated rest with prayer and reading, the Vatican said. He expressed gratitude for all the prayers and get-well messages he has received.",
