  "text": "It feels like we've got an epidemic of \"pastors\" who have never once cracked open a Bible and who have most certainly never read an epistle from the Apostle Paul.\nThe latest example is this United Church of Christ \"minister\" from LA who thinks the resurrection may or may not have happened. But, honestly, she doesn't care.\nWell, do I think that it (the resurrection) could have happened and did happen? I believe so ... I feel it probably did.\nOkay, great! Stop right there. Don't say another word. Drop the \"probably\" and move on, you're doing okay!\nBut no, she continues.\nBut if I'm to be scientific or realistic I don't know. And I say that because there's no 'proof,' there's no 'proof.'\nDid it really happen? ... Did Jesus really raise from the dead? I don't know.\nThis is where CS Lewis would insert a \"Your Affectionate Uncle, Screwtape.\"\nTo make matters (somehow) worse, she decided to double down.\nIf Jesus didn't physically raise from the dead and ascend, it doesn't change a thing about my love of God and Christ and Christianity ... because I truly believe in my heart of hearts that my faith is a resurrection faith ... come to Easter service and hear a heretical sermon!\nWell, she got that last part right!\nJesus' ressureaction doesn't matter to you? It wouldn't change your faith?\nWhat did the Apostle Paul have to say about that?\nI Corinthians 15:14-17\n'And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty. Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up — if in fact the dead do not rise. For if the dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen. And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins!'\nRead the Bible, Reverend Pat!\nP.S.
