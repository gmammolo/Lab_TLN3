  "text": "\"A Special Vocation, Full of Penance\"\nOn 20 November the Carthusian monk, Dom Basilio Trivellato, passed away. CartusiaLover.Wordpress.com (14 February) published a speech he gave on 7 November 2015 when he was prior of the Carthusian monastery of Serra San Bruno, Calabria, and welcomed a delegation from the Parish of San Bruno in Reggio Calabria.\nI thank you for the gift of your presence here in the Charterhouse. St Bruno is a great saint, but not very well known. The Church is getting to know him more and more through you, his devoted children, who spread and preserve his memory.\nI too, coming from Northern Italy, was positively struck by the great devotion that exists around St Bruno in these places.\nCurrently in the Carthusian Order there are 17 male and 5 female monasteries, but in the past, can you believe it, there were 268 monasteries in total! We will always be a small group, because it is a particular vocation, full of penance.\nBut the real problem lies in the young people, who enter the monastery as graduates and must gradually come to realise that their qualifications mean nothing here. My vicar was a great lawyer, who took part in important trials. Now he's cleaning the corridor.\nWhen you enter the Carthusians you have to accept dying to yourself. Those who enter here, enter only for the Lord to continue to seek him. A vocation is not invented, it is He who calls.\nThere are some who arrive full of enthusiasm on the first day, and I think: this one has more vocation than me! Then, the next day, around ten in the morning, they come and say that ours is a beautiful vocation, with lots of prayer, but they don't feel up to continuing. No wonder.\nSomeone arrives and says that the outside world is evil and that they can't wait to leave it completely. And I say: Listen, maybe you should go back to the world and try to improve it, this is not your place, you come here for the Lord, not to leave the world.\nWe need to hold on to two pillars: we are hermits and we are coenobites. Hermits because we live alone in our cells, coenobites because we have three daily moments of prayer in common.\nIf we want to go to Heaven too, we must practise mutual charity, which is the most difficult thing of all. The Lord told us in his testament that by this, by love, they will recognise you as my disciples (cf. Jn 13:34-35). If we are incapable of loving and forgiving each other, how can we talk about a Christian vocation?\nThat's why we have three common moments of prayer: in the morning, we centre our prayer on the Holy Mass; in the evening on Vespers and at night on the Office, which begins around 12:30am and lasts for two to three hours, and at Christmas and Easter it lasts for five hours.\nSome people think that Carthusians always stay inside the Charterhouse, that they live a life of great penance and seclusion and therefore never go out, but in fact once a week we go out and we can talk to the people we meet.\nThis meeting of ours is also quite exceptional. It's the first and last time I'll meet a parish, but I couldn't help but meet the parish priest and the faithful of the world's first parish community dedicated to St. Bruno!\nJust think, from Sunday to Sunday my fellow monks stay in their cells without speaking to anyone, and if they want to talk they have to ask the prior's permission.\nTwice a year, we receive visits from our relatives. This is why it is so difficult to become a Carthusian, our human nature, our ‘little donkey’ is always with us.\nNow you understand why we need to go out to reinvigorate ourselves in nature and find a certain balance in talking to each other and practising charity among ourselves.\nSt Bruno was a wise and balanced person and he decided to choose the best of the hermitic and cenobitic life to guarantee a healthy and harmonious Christian experience.\nIn the case that a brother is ill, we help each other, we are assisted by the health personnel or, in the most serious cases, we go to the clinic. We never eat meat, but obviously in case of illness it is permissible to eat it.\nI have been here for a year, I had already been here for two years in 1999-2000, to help Dom Jacques Dupont in his role as procurator general and prior. Then, the brothers elected me and I returned here to Serra San Bruno as prior, leaving the Certosa di Farneta in Tuscany. The Lord has helped me and helps me, despite my age, to be prior of this community.\nBefore, I was a diocesan priest, parish priest, and I studied and read St Teresa of Avila, Thomas Merton and so I began to think about the contemplative life and since the parish bordered the Certosa di Vedana in Belluno I began to go there for weekly Confession and there I made my commitment to the Lord ten days before my 45th birthday, after which it is not permitted to enter the Certosa.\nObviously I have never regretted having been a priest and then a parish priest, it was all a crescendo in the Lord.\nYour parish has the great task of living under the protection of St Bruno, you too, like us Carthusians, must pray to the Lord.\nWe are here to pray to the Lord for all those who wish to live according to the spirit of St Bruno. We are here to talk to the Lord about each person so that they may be guided and supported, to talk to Him about our families who are attacked by the Devil, but we are strong in the faith of our Saints. St Bruno, Natuzza said, is a great Saint!\nSt Bruno lacked nothing, he was an esteemed professor, he had been offered the chance to become a bishop, but instead he left everything to concentrate on praying with the Lord, and so founded the Grande Certosa in an almost inaccessible mountainous area, where he experienced the pain of the death of the first Carthusians due to an avalanche.\nAnd when, after six years, everything seemed peaceful, Pope Urban II, a disciple of St Bruno, called him to Rome, from where he then moved to Calabria, first to La Torre and then to Santa Maria where he built the Charterhouse, around which the present town would flourish, a town that still today breathes the spirituality of St Bruno.\nSaint Bruno lived in obedience and peace, certain that he was following God's will; this is also the teaching that John XXIII left as a legacy to each of us and to the Church.\nTo become a Carthusian today, it is necessary to discern and examine one's vocation in the light of the Carthusian Statutes, in the knowledge that it is the work of the Holy Spirit, who wanted this witness, this charism, in the Church, according to which some among the many, in the name of all the others, would place themselves before God in prayer.\nThe path to becoming a Carthusian involves an initial period of postulancy lasting from three months to a year.\nThen comes the novitiate, lasting one to two years, which begins with the taking of the habit, with the wearing of a white robe and a black cape, which recalls the journey to be made to become a Carthusian, to become white through the purification of the heart.\nAfterwards, the first profession takes place, for a period of three years, during which time the candidate no longer belongs to the world and leaves all his possessions behind.\nThe profession is then renewed for another two years, at the end of which, with the solemn profession, the candidate becomes a Carthusian.\nAll this involves a process that lasts from seven to ten years, depending on the prior's judgement of the candidate's suitability.\nThere aren't many Carthusians, because it's a demanding vocation; in total we have 370 monks and nuns. There are twelve of us monks here in Serra, and we normally live in a certain stability in our Carthusian monasteries.\nThank you, dear brothers and sisters, for this meeting, which is an exception.\nLet us pray together a Hail Mary and then receive the Lord's blessing. Hail Mary... Saint Bruno, pray for us.\nThrough the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, all the Saints, St Michael the Archangel and St Bruno, may the blessing of Almighty God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit descend upon you, upon your relatives and may He be with you all always. Amen.\nHave a good pilgrimage, have a good rest of the day and let's remember each other in our prayers.\nPicture: CartusiaLover.Wordpress.com,\nI thank you for the gift of your presence here in the Charterhouse.
