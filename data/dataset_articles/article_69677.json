  "text": "The domestic mission agency of the Presbyterian Church in America has removed a webpage containing links to advice about how illegal immigrants can avoid being detained by law enforcement authorities.\nThe archived webpage published on January 9 by Mission to North America (MNA) started by framing the issue with a question, “Did you know? The average undocumented person has been present in the US for more than a decade.”\nIt went on to provide links to “reliable secular sources” that “may be useful to you as you seek to love your immigrant neighbor well.”\nIn a statement published on byFaith ’s website, the PCA apologized.\n“MNA’s leadership erroneously allowed the posting of content that advised undocumented persons on ways to avoid being detained by authorities. We affirm that it is our Christian duty to obey the lawful commands of the civil magistrate and be subject to their authority (WCF 23.4; Romans 13:1-4; 1 Peter 2:13-14). To counsel otherwise is a sin…We repent and apologize.”\nThe apology acknowledged the action had fallen short of the “Biblical and Confessional standard” and had caused “confusion and consternation” in the PCA.\nIt also acknowledged that MNA should not engage in providing legal advice or engaging in political campaigns.\n“The information we post going forward will provide ecclesiastical resources in line with our Confession for guidance on the matter,” the statement said. The PCA holds the Westminster Confession of Faith as its denominational doctrinal standard.\nThe MNA permanent committee has a meeting scheduled for the first week of March and is planning to discuss this issue in more detail “as part of the Committee’s regular oversight of MNA’s ministries.”\nMission to North America is focused on church planting throughout the U.S. and Canada and also promotes church vitality by providing ministry resources that “enable churches to grow in their outward-facing missional engagement.\nThe Refugee and Immigrant Ministry is part of the church vitality prong of MNA’s mission.\nTO OUR READERS : Do you have a story idea, or do you want to give us feedback about this or any other story?
