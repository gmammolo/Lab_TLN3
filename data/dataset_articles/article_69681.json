  "text": "By Religion Reporter | Harare, Zimbabwe – In a dramatic proclamation that went into Saturday midnight, Andrew Wutaunashe, the self-proclaimed chief prophet of Emmerson Mnangagwa, has declared that the Zimbabwean President has reached the end of his divine seven-year rule, comparing his fall to that of King Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian ruler who was humbled by God and reduced to spend the next 7 years eating grass, among animals.\nWutaunashe, addressing his ‘prayerfull’ congregation, claimed that God first revealed Mnangagwa’s rise and fall to him in 1997 and again in 2010, which would be only for a seven year glorious period, after which Mnangagwa would lose supernatural power and start manifesting humannness. He suggested that his expiration is part of God’s divine plan.\nAndrew Wutaunashe\nA Leader Humbled, Like Nebuchadnezzar\nWutaunashe directly suggested Mnangagwa’s downfall, emphasizing that it was God’s doing, not man’s will:\n“I wanted to just hear from God, and God told me he’s being humbled, Amen. Everyone is saying whatever they want to say. But when people say things they want to say about a leader, don’t make the mistake of thinking that that unmakes him as a leader,” he said.\nHe stressed that while Mnangagwa’s humiliation is trending on social media, it does not negate his divine calling, even after its expiration.\nReinforcing that leaders are chosen by God, not by popular opinion, he said,\n“Leaders are not raised because of people’s opinions. They are raised because of God’s calling, those callings which are without repentance, Hallelujah.”\nDespite acknowledging Mnangagwa’s divine humbling, Wutaunashe warned that no one should dare take his throne:\n“God said he’s being humbled, but no one must take his throne, and he must fulfill his ministry. Say, Hallelujah. He must fulfill the mission that God has given him.”\nA Call for Military Action Against Mnangagwa’s Challengers?\nIn an unsettling twist, Wutaunashe likened Blessed Geza, the war veteran and military strategist leading calls for Mnangagwa’s resignation, to Absalom, the Biblical son of King David who attempted to seize his father’s throne but was ultimately slain by the military.\n“Now some of you may not understand this, but this happened to David as a king. His own (Blessed) Geza was his own son who rose up against him and almost took the kingdom, but God had not changed His mind.”\nHe further suggested that the solution to this political rebellion is military action, drawing a direct parallel to Absalom’s fate. His remarks implied that Geza and Vice President Constantino Chiwenga must be “removed” through force, just as Absalom was.\nZimbabwe at a Crossroads: Prophecy or Political Turmoil?\nWutaunashe’s remarks have sent shockwaves through Zimbabwe’s political and religious circles. His acknowledgment of Mnangagwa’s humiliation, combined with his insistence on preserving the leader’s throne and his biblical justification for military action, raises serious concerns.\nWith political tensions already at a boiling point, could Mnangagwa’s military backers heed Wutaunashe’s call? Will Zimbabwe see a violent power struggle, or will Mnangagwa accept his prophetic humbling?\nFor now, the nation watches—and prays—as this prediction continues to appear to unfold, as if it was truly divine.\nTWO LIVE BROADCASTS ARE SET TO BE BEAMED OVER THE MATTER ON ZIMEYE ON SUNDAY 12NOON (30min), and ANOTHER AT 5pm (30min), and present will be leading war veterans and tacticians involved in the Geza led movement.",
