  "text": "Akal Takht Jathedar’s statement puts SGPC, SAD in the dock, traces the root of Damdama Sahib jathedar’s sacking to Dec 2 decisions\nJalandhar: Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Raghbir Singh's statement on Thursday evening against the sacking of Takht Damdama Sahib Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh puts the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leadership in the dock on more than one count. He not only questioned it on merit and procedure but also traced its roots to the Dec 2 pronouncement from Akal Takht. The statement, coupled with the delay in issuing it, highlights how he is caught between the SGPC and the SAD leadership controlling it on one side, and the reaction from several other quarters of the community, who are questioning the ‘delay' in his reaction and urging him to act with more clarity.\nWhen one of the five Sikh high priests, who were signatories to the Dec 2 decisions, was already shown the door by throwing taint at him, the Akal Takht Jathedar now finds himself at odds with the SGPC and the SAD leadership.\n\"After the Dec 2 decisions from Akal Takht, according to the Panthic sentiments and traditions, it appeared that an atmosphere was being created against the Singh Sahiban (Sikh high priests) in a well-planned way,\" he said, while also calling the sacking \"extremely condemnable and unfortunate,\" which is damaging the independent status of the (Sikh) Takhts.\nFormer Takht Damdama Sahib Jathedar and other Sikh quarters have expressed that Giani Harpreet Singh was targeted because of his stance following the Dec 2 pronouncement, particularly as the leadership of Sukhbir Singh Badal's camp was displeased with it.\nWith the use of such strong expressions, the Akal Takht Jathedar has not only put a big question mark on the claims of the SAD leadership that they ‘humbly and fully accepted' the Akal Takht directive of Dec 2, but has also put up a challenge for himself. By tracing the roots of the sacking to the Dec 2 pronouncement, he implies that it was done with malintent and reiterates that a probe against a Takht Jathedar was not under SGPC's purview and the matter should have been given to the Akal Takht.\nMany Sikh netizens and activists commented on his Facebook post, where his statement was first shared, arguing that his statement was not enough, and he would have to act with clarity. Scores of Sikh netizens posted similar comments on their social media accounts.\nSo far, neither the SGPC nor the SAD leadership has responded to the Akal Takht Jathedar's statement, and they appear to be in a quandary. Though supporters of Sukhbir's camp have been strongly criticising Giani Harpreet Singh, some even using acerbic language, and have continued to express support for the SAD leaders and SGPC's decision, there does not appear to be a clear reaction from them to the Akal Takht Jathedar's statement.\nMSID:: 118251504 413 |",
