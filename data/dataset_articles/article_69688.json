  "text": "STOMP it anytime, anywhere.\nDownload the new STOMP app today.\nTabla\nFeb 14, 2025\nWith almost 16,000 devotees participating in Thaipusam on Feb 11 – an increase from previous years – many of them experienced delays at the Tank Road temple.\nMs Saritha Rajaraman, 40, who carried a paal kudam, said there was some confusion over queues for participants at the Sri Thendayuthapani Temple. “This led to overcrowding and caused some tired devotees to lose their composure,” she added.\nThis year’s event drew some 30,000 visitors – a 12,000 increase from last year.\nHome Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam, who was guest of honour at the festival, commended the arrangements, but noted that “something can be done” about the long waiting periods to enter the temple in Tank Road.\nSpeaking to reporters on the sidelines, Mr Shanmugam said: “Quite a few people mentioned that they were waiting for a very long time. The elderly and those carrying milk said they had been waiting for two, 2½, even three hours.”\nMr Shanmugam said he met with the management of both temples involved to discuss possible solutions.\n“The main issue is that when people come in front of the deity at the sanctum, they want to spend some time. If they are asked to leave quickly – after having waited for hours – they understandably want at least four or five minutes. You can imagine if 10 people spend five minutes each, that’s an hour.”\nHe added: “The two temples, the Hindu Endowments Board, as well as the management of the Tank Road temple, will need to come together to explore solutions – perhaps using technology or releasing people in batches.”\nRemarking that he does not yet know “what is feasible”, he said he would speak with the authorities to see what could be done.\n[Thaipusam] Every year, schedule permitting, I try and go for the Thaipusam festival. I usually go to the Perumal...\nIn a joint statement by Sri Thendayuthapani Temple, Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple, and Hindu Endowments Board, a spokesperson said: “We acknowledge the comments made by Mr Shanmugam on the importance of reducing wait time to improve the experience during Thaipusam.\n“We recognise that many devotees faced prolonged wait times to reach the sanctum to fulfil their vows. We deeply appreciate their patience and devotion.\n“To address this, we will conduct a thorough review of this year’s Thaipusam arrangements, analysing both the ground logistics and operational challenges. Feedback will be sought from devotees and other stakeholders to help us identify areas for improvement.\n“The safety, well-being, and comfort of all devotees remain our highest priority. We are committed to improving the Thaipusam experience while preserving its significance as a sacred and meaningful celebration.”",
