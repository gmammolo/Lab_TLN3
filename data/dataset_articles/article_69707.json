  "text": "Metropolitan Yevstratiy, the Deputy Head of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine’s External Church Relations, accuses the Russian Orthodox Church of being nothing more than an arm of the Kremlin, doing the bidding of President Vladimir Putin, the proverbial ‘wolf in sheep’s clothing’. In this case, religious vestments, and telling Russian soldiers fighting against Ukraine that if they die in battle, they will immediately go to paradise, all sins forgiven. In 2019, Ukraine’s Orthodox Church was granted independence from the Russian Orthodox Church. It caused an uproar in Moscow. Kirill and Putin refused to recognize the authority of the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew in Constantinople (modern day Istanbul, Turkey) that authorized Ukraine’s identity as an Autocephalous Church. That Russia is engaged in a Holy War is not in question. But it’s Patriarch Kirill in Moscow, says Yevstratiy, that claims the Russian aggression against Ukraine is for the “Liberation of Ukrainians from Godless West… From the evil.” And to, “bring to Ukraine the light and truth.” On this episode of Lighthouse Faith podcast, Metropolitan Yevstratiy also reveals a scarier version of the war in Ukraine; that Putin and Kirill want to make Moscow the third and final Rome, labeling the rest of Christianity, Catholics and Protestants alike as heretics and pagans. As President Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth look for diplomatic solutions to the war’s end, Yevstratiy and His Beatitude Metropolitan Epiphany, the leader of the OCU, are faithful that God Himself will bring an end to the battle.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
