  "text": "-\ndreamy take that, Vance, you nasty little convert panting after the tradcaths. it’s hard to fuck up converting to Catholicism so bad that you wind up being specifically admonished by the Pope.\nthe actual letter itself is also well worth reading and pulls no punches for a Catholic audience; it’s the kind of reading someone for filth you can only pull off from someone who knows you very well and shares a lot of theoretical values with you. on a theological level, invoking the thirty days of wandering lost in the desert, Jesus as a god-become-man, and Joseph-Mary-and-Jesus in Nazareth as refugees are all extremely powerful metaphors within context; so is invoking the story of the Good Samaritan as the source of the central insight in the fullest maturity of humankind.\nThen he ends by speaking to three groups. The first is American Catholic bishops, who he very pointedly praises for the efforts to support immigrants and refugees they are most assuredly making, for which God will of course reward them. (The American bishopric as a whole is a particularly conservative faction among international Catholicism and in fact most recently had a scandal when the second Catholic US president ever was elected in 2020 and a bunch of them threw fits at the idea of congratulating the new President on account of it was Biden; the Pope, by contrast, is a Jesuit out of Argentina whose parents fled Mussolini, and he is not into that shit.)\nThe second group he addresses is American lay Catholics and “all men and women of good will, not to give in to narratives that discriminate against and cause unnecessary suffering to our migrant and refugee brothers and sisters.” He’s just taken some time to extremely clearly demand that the lay faithful “consider the legitimacy of norms and public policies in the light of the dignity of the person and his or her fundamental rights, not vice versa,” and otherwise strongly imply that unjust laws should be opposed by as many of the citizenry as possible. In that light, he’s juuuuuuuuuuuust one level of plausible deniability away from calling for all Catholics to oppose this administration, root and stem, as a grave matter of high-stakes faith.\nThen he ends by invoking Mary to protect all refugees and immigrants worldwide, just to really grind it in where his concern lies and what he thinks people of good conscience should do. it’s written very strongly and very sharply. deeply satisfying to read, thank you, and about what you’d expect from the first pope ever to name himself for St Francis of Assisi.\n-\nfrog-sama420liked thiscaptainwiticismsliked thistheneverfadinglandsliked thisgreypistacchioliked thisthot-criminalliked thisillya-romareblogged this fromharpersgonnaharpkindacynicalliked thisaavjoliked thisdiscomoondayliked thisbleedinghearthypocritreblogged this fromsee-arcaneim-not-the-one-youre-looking-forreblogged this fromsparrowpostingharpersgonnaharpreblogged this fromjustnoodlefishthingsharpersgonnaharpliked thisrainbow-spinelli13liked this[bloodanddarknesss](https://bloodanddarknesss.tumblr.com/post/775636913078009856)reblogged this from[squeeful](https://squeeful.tumblr.com/)[penguintreblemaker](https://penguintreblemaker.tumblr.com/)liked this[poststoshow](https://poststoshow.tumblr.com/post/775636852996702208)reblogged this from[mostly-funnytwittertweets](https://mostly-funnytwittertweets.tumblr.com/)[blueravencat](https://blueravencat.tumblr.com/post/775636816926785537)reblogged this from[beanabouttown](https://beanabouttown.tumblr.com/)[damoclesangel](https://damoclesangel.tumblr.com/)liked this[catholicwaifu](https://catholicwaifu.tumblr.com/post/775636793195380736)reblogged this from[r-r-raf](https://r-r-raf.tumblr.com/)[plontsrcool](https://plontsrcool.tumblr.com/)liked this[goldpilot22](https://goldpilot22.tumblr.com/)liked this[blueravencat](https://blueravencat.tumblr.com/)liked this[regina-del-cielo](https://regina-del-cielo.tumblr.com/)liked this[lessbien-every-day](https://lessbien-every-day.tumblr.com/)liked this[octaviangrey](https://octaviangrey.tumblr.com/)liked this[woodenpizza123](https://woodenpizza123.tumblr.com/)liked this[octaviangrey](https://octaviangrey.tumblr.com/post/775636507656585216)reblogged this from[beanabouttown](https://beanabouttown.tumblr.com/)[powerpun](https://powerpun.tumblr.com/post/775636492251955200)reblogged this from[paranoidgemsbok](https://paranoidgemsbok.tumblr.com/)[doctordestiny](https://doctordestiny.tumblr.com/)liked this[s0r3wach1gauy0](https://s0r3wach1gauy0.tumblr.com/post/775636454264242176)reblogged this from[cwnerd12](https://cwnerd12.tumblr.com/)[goldendaysofsummer](https://goldendaysofsummer.tumblr.com/post/775636309964374016)reblogged this from[beanabouttown](https://beanabouttown.tumblr.com/)[msflora-lynn](https://msflora-lynn.tumblr.com/)liked this[goldendaysofsummer](https://goldendaysofsummer.tumblr.com/)liked this[blackcatcoven](https://blackcatcoven.tumblr.com/post/775636208791502848)reblogged this from[fagreus](https://fagreus.tumblr.com/)[blackcatcoven](https://blackcatcoven.tumblr.com/)liked this[s0r3wach1gauy0](https://s0r3wach1gauy0.tumblr.com/)liked this[weird-and-gifted](https://weird-and-gifted.tumblr.com/post/775636130342322176)reblogged this from[musicalhell](https://musicalhell.tumblr.com/)[heavypicklebrokemydundunheart](https://heavypicklebrokemydundunheart.tumblr.com/)liked this[lucinata](https://lucinata.tumblr.com/)liked this[lucinata](https://lucinata.tumblr.com/post/775636087373709312)reblogged this from[helluvamystery](https://helluvamystery.tumblr.com/)[zuzypiia](https://zuzypiia.tumblr.com/)liked this[thylacinetears](https://thylacinetears.tumblr.com/)liked this[luv-not-hate](https://luv-not-hate.tumblr.com/post/775635958878060544)reblogged this from[sideguitars](https://sideguitars.tumblr.com/)[luv-not-hate](https://luv-not-hate.tumblr.com/)liked this[leighrobertsreads](https://leighrobertsreads.tumblr.com/)liked this[mostly-funnytwittertweets](https://mostly-funnytwittertweets.tumblr.com/)posted this[Show more notes](https://last-on-your-lips.tumblr.com)",
