  "text": "The Amir and National Head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama’at of Nigeria, Alhaji Alatoye AbdulAzeez has expressed concerns that recent discussions surrounding Sharia law enforcement in the Southwest might be driven by political motivations rather than genuine religious intentions.\nThe Amir stated this at a press conference on “World Crisis and the Pathway to Peace”, where he received the managing director of Muslim Television Ahmadiyya (MTA) International, Sir Munir-ud-Din Shams, at Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama’at headquarters in Lagos.\nAlhaji AbdulAzeez described the comments as overly sentimental, clarifying that Sharia courts have long been established in the Southwest region.\nHe cited a Sharia court in Ojokoro as an example, noting recent disagreements on marital issues where individuals chose between customary and Sharia courts.\nAlhaji AbdulAzeez affirmed that Nigeria remains a secular state, with Sharia courts serving only Muslims, adding that, “The Southwest is peaceful, with various religious groups living harmoniously. Sharia courts resolve issues between Muslims who opt to use them. No non-Muslim can be forced to adhere to Sharia law.”\nHe suggested that the recent discussions might be politically motivated, reiterating that Sharia has existed in Nigeria long before anyone began mobilising for crises and wars. According to him, this is a case of political Sharia rather than religious.\nThe Amir highlighted concerns over the wrongful application of Sharia such as stoning individuals to death for expressing themselves, which is a criminal offence under Nigerian law.\nHe stressed that Sharia courts in states like Lagos, Ogun and Kwara primarily handle marital and inheritance laws, not criminal offences.\nDrawing from the recently published book by the worldwide head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, His Holiness Hazrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad, Sir Munir-ud-Din Shams assessed the current world situation, describing it as a turbulent time marked by a continuing global economic crisis and alarming parallels to the period preceding the Second World War.",
