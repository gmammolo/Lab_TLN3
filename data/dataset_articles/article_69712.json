  "text": "Religion : Sacked CBC Members File Umpteenth Case Against Church\nBy Kimeng Hilton- 16 févr. 2025 13:21\n0 Likes\nThe matter, the only criminal suit out of the 10 so far brought against the Cameroon Baptist Convention and its officials, opened in a Yaounde court on February 13, 2025.\nWithin the span of less than a year, some dismissed members of the Cameroon Baptist Convention, CBC, have filed a barrage of 10 legal actions against the church and its officials. Challenging the 2023 amended CBC Constitution and the General Session or decentralized elections for CBC national leaders that held on November 23, 2024. While 9 of the cases have been civil in nature, the latest is criminal. It was filed before the Yaounde Court of First Instance, Centre Administratif.\nTwo Litigants\nThe litigants this time are Mr. Emi Emmanuel from Bamenda and Mr. Albert Luma from Buea. Chief Jacob Taku who is plaintiff in the other matters is not involved in the latest suit. The two are challenging the holding of CBC elections on November 23, 2024, allegedly in violation of a November 21, 2024 ruling by the Yaounde Court of First Instance, Centre Administratif. The order temporarily suspended the holding of the vote in Yaounde until the plaintiffs’ challenge of the amended CBC Constitution of 2023 had been settled definitely.\nThree Accused\nJoined in the new matter are Rev. Dr. Nditemeh Charlemagne, the immediate past CBC Executive President who handed over to Rev. Dr. Teke John in early January 2025. Mr. Yosimbom Mkong John, the immediate past CBC Chairperson. And Rinda Kawep Jumbuin, the 15-year-old son of Rev. Jumbuin Enoch, Pastor of the Yaounde Field Conference of CBC Churches - according to the motion filed by counsel for the litigants. The matter opened in the Yaounde Court of First Instance, Centre Administratif on Thursday, February 13, 2025. But was not opened to the public as it was the preliminary phase for counsel for the accused (the CBC) to acquaint themselves with the details of the suit.\nFor Allegedly Violating Court Order\nOne of the counsel for the litigants, Maître Fernand Honoré Tagouemekong, spoke to Cameroon Tribune on phone. He said they filed the matter of urgent application because the CBC violated the ruling in November 2024 by the Yaounde Court of First Instance, Centre Administratif suspending the holding of the CBC decentralized General Session elections. Until definite verdicts had been made in the previous matters challenging the CBC amended Constitution of 2023.\nPossible Two-year Imprisonment, Fine\n“But the order of the judge of urgent application was violated by the CBC by going ahead with the elections. This is why our clients filed criminal proceedings, seeking the sentence of the three CBC defendants for at least two years’ imprisonment; and the payment of damage,” Maître Tagouemekong noted.\nAccelerated Private Prosecution\nAlso speaking to Cameroon Tribune on phone, Barrister Sonkwa Victorine, lead counsel for the Cameroon Baptist Convention in the matter, said the action was commenced by way of private prosecution. Meaning neither the police nor the gendarmes investigated the matter; but it is provided for by Cameroon’s Criminal Code.\nFebruary 27, 2025 For Next Hearing\nBarrister Sonkwa explained that for such a matter to be heard, the President of the Court fixes a deposit that must be paid by the litigant and a date scheduled for hearing. If on the day of hearing the litigant has not paid the deposit, the matter will be thrown out. If paid, the matter can continue. In the criminal matter against the CBC former officials and a CBC Christian, the Yaounde Court of First Instance Centre Administratif fixed the deposit at 40,000 FCFA. And the date for the next hearing for February 27, 2025.\nMinor As One Of The Accused\n“Do the complainants have the locus standi to sue Rev. Dr. Nditemeh and Mr. Yosimbom, over the CBC Constitution, given that they are no longer members of the CBC? The answer is no!” Barrister Victorine said. “Moreover, the third person joined in the suit is a 15-year-old boy, a minor, who does not have criminal responsibility! …. We respected the ruling of the Yaounde Court of First Instance, Centre Administratif that elections be suspended in Yaounde. No elections held in Yaounde and so we don’t know what they are contesting. They are only making noise to stay on top and be relevant,” Barrister Sonkwa said.\nThe Last Matter Last Year\nIn the afternoon of Thursday, November 21, 2024m, the President of the Yaounde Court of First Instance Centre Administratif, Justice Theophile Georges Ntimba, read out his brief verdict. Dismissing the CBC’s arguments that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter, which should be rather handled by an administrative court.\nBut the judge granted the prayer of the three former Cameroon Baptist Convention, CBC members that decentralised CBC nationwide elections scheduled for Saturday, November 23, 2024 be temporarily suspended in Yaounde voting centre. While they are allowed to go ahead as scheduled in the other 11 voting centres across the country. Justice Ntimba said his ruling was given pending judgement in the matter between ex-CBC members and the CBC currently before the Mezam High Court in Bamenda, North West Region. Justice Ntimba gave the defendants 15 days to appeal the judgement.\nMeanwhile, ruling in the substantive matter between the three CBC ex-members and CBC leadership before the Mezam High Court was earlier scheduled for November 19, 2024. Then adjourned to Thursday, November 21, 2024. Before a further adjournment to Friday, November 22, 2024. Just a day before CBC elections on November 23, 2024. Followed by indefinite adjournments.\nIn the matter of accelerated action brought by three former CBC members, Albert Luma, Emi Emmanuel and Chief Jacob Taku, through their counsel, had prayed the Yaounde Court of First Instance, Centre Administratif to suspend the holding in Yaounde of CBC decentralised nationwide elections for national leaders on November 23, 2024.\n&ldquo...\nThis article is for subscribers only\nAlready subscribed?\nIdentify yourself >\nUnlimited access to Cameroon Tribune Digital from 26,250 FCFA\nI subscribe\n1 minute is enough to subscribe to Cameroon Tribune Digital!\n- Your special cameroon-tribune issue in digital version\n- Inserts\n- Exclusive calls for tenders\n- Preview (access 24 hours before publication)\n- Editions available on all media (smartphone, tablets, PC)",
