(DC) Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Mohan Yadav on Sunday dared Leader of Opposition (LoP) in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi and AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge to take holy dip in Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh on the occasion of Maha Kumbh, wondering ‘When they will perform the ritual as Hindus’.\nAddressing the ‘Lodhi’ community here, Mr Yadav said that the Congress leaders used to go all out to flaunt themselves as Hindus by visiting temples during the election time, but never bothered to visit the prominent Hindu shrines in Mathura and Ayodhya (Ram temple).\n“They (Congress leaders) flaunt themselves as Hindus during election time. Why have Mr (Rahul) Gandhi and Mr Kharge not yet gone to Triveni Sangam to take holy dip on the occasion of Maha Kumbh, if they call themselves Hindus?”, he said.\nHe also asked Congress veteran and former chief minister Digvijay Singh who along with his MLA son Jaivardhan took holy dip at Triveni Sangam a few days ago, if he had taken permission from the AICC leadership to do so.\nMr Yadav also took a swipe at Congress for demanding to conduct caste census, saying that it was former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru who first stopped it.\nHe said that BJP has undertaken several measures for the development of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in the country.\nThe party has for the first time accorded constitutional status to the OBC commission, he said.\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )",
