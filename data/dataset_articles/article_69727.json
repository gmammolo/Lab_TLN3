  "text": "The Brief The Diocese of Joliet announced it will close four of its churches later this year. The closures are the latest step in the diocese's process of \"targeted restructuring.\" Several other parishes will amalgamate, or essentially combine, later this summer as well. CREST HILL, Ill. - The Diocese of Joliet announced it will close four of its churches and essentially combine several others as a part of its \"targeted restructuring\" amid declining mass attendance and donations.\nBishop Ronald Hicks made the announcement last week which came as a result of months of work by a committee of clergy and laypeople to determine how the diocese should restructure.\nThe Diocese of Joliet was established in 1948 and serves more than 500,000 Catholics across DuPage, Kankakee, Will, Grundy, Ford, Iroquois, and Kendall counties. The data is accurate as of 2021, according to the diocese website.\nChurch closures this summer What we know:\nFour parishes in DuPage , Grundy and Will counties will close effective July 1, Hicks said.\nOne chapel will also close.\nThey include:\nSt. Mary in Park Forest St. Patrick (Wilton Center) in Manhattan St. Luke in Carol Stream St. John the Apostle in Villa Park St. Lawrence O’Toole Chapel in Essex These closure announcements are part of the third phase of the diocese’s restructuring process, which began last year. Diocese officials underwent an 11-month \"listening, review and discussion process,\" Hicks said.\nThe committee made recommendations to Hicks for his approval.\nMultiple parishes will amalgamate, or one parish will join an existing parish. Two parishes, St. Paul the Apostle in Peotone and Christ the Servant in Woodridge, will continue to operate as independent parishes.\nThese changes will also take effect on July 1.\n\"While I'm confident we are doing the right things and making sound decisions to make our diocese and our church stronger and able to thrive, I also appreciate and understand that if these outcomes directly affect you, or where you may worship, these actions may be difficult changes for you,\" Hicks said. \"And cause great hurt, sadness, and grieving.\"\nPrevious efforts to close other parishes have been met with pushback from church members.\nThe bishop discussed the announcements at length in a video posted to the Diocese of Joliet YouTube channel.\n‘Pruning’ of the diocese The backstory:\nThe closures are just the latest step in a process that began in 2021 to \"prune\" the diocese, a reference to a passage from the Gospel of St. John when Jesus tells his disciples that branches must be pruned from the vine to bear more fruit.\nThe diocese explained on its website that, like other Catholic diocese across the U.S., the process of consolidating and downsizing came about due to an aging priest population and a decline in Mass attendance and donations.\nThe population of those identifying as Catholic has been on the decline for years and more people are identifying as \"nones,\" or those claiming no religious affiliation.\nThe diocese also cited increased costs for building maintenance at its aging churches and schools. Catholic school enrollment is also on the decline, made worse by a nationwide teacher shortage.\nFor more information on the diocese's restructuring process, visit diojoliet.org .\nThe Source The information in this story was provided by the Diocese of Joliet.",
