  "text": "(Minghui.org) I believe every practitioner understands the importance of respecting Dafa and [Master Li]. Recently, many practitioners have discussed the serious consequences of disrespecting either the Great Law or the founder of Falun Dafa. I would like to share some instances of disrespectful behavior that I have witnessed in the hope that we can all reflect on our conduct and correct any behaviors that do not align with the [Fa].\nChen has endured persecution by the Chinese Communist government, survived two major car accidents, and overcome a severe illness—yet nothing has shaken her faith in Falun Dafa. Fellow practitioners who knew her admired her perseverance.\nRecently, I visited her at home twice. The first time, I noticed that [Zhuan Falun] was sitting on the backrest of a dirty sofa in her living room. Considering that she had just lost a loved one, I cleaned the sofa without mentioning my concern. However, when I visited again, I saw that the book was in the same spot. I also noticed that the spine of the book was noticeably darker than the rest, indicating that was where it was frequently touched. At the time, I didn’t think much of it.\nAfter she finished her meal, we read Master’s article How Humankind Came To Be together. I asked her, “Did you wash your hands after you ate?” She said had not and immediately went and washed them. Later, she admitted that she rarely washed her hands before reading Zhuan Falun, except after using the restroom.\nShe also told me that the local authorities had raided her home many times and always confiscated her Dafa books. Sometimes, however, they didn’t take copies of Minghui Weekly, even when they were in plain sight.\nI asked if she had ever considered that it happened because the old forces exploited her disrespect for Dafa books and used it as an excuse to take them away, imprison her, or make her ill.\nBai, who has since passed away due to illness, used to press her thumb on the pages as she read Zhuan Falun, often covering the words. Despite repeated reminders from fellow practitioners not to do that, she dismissed their concerns. Over time, the words near the spine of her book grew fuzzy from her constantly touching them. The pages even bore imprints from her nails and visible spittle marks. She didn’t always wash her hands after using the restroom before continuing to read. When she needed to pause, she would set the open book face down.\nMei, who also passed away due to illness, did not take Fa study seriously and often used her Fa study time to chat with her mother. As soon as she felt sleepy, she would stop reading and go straight to bed. She frequently left her book open, face down, in random places. Some pages even had juice stains on them.\nI am not criticizing anyone but rather highlighting the phenomena of disrespecting Dafa and Master. I hope that those in similar situations will take immediate steps to correct their behavior. Of course, I am not implying that disrespecting Dafa is the direct cause of all the persecution practitioners face. However, it is certainly worthy of our attention.\nAdditionally, for elderly practitioners who live alone, I hope fellow practitioners will kindly remind them if they notice any issues related to disrespecting Dafa or Master.\nWhen I pointed out Bai and Mei’s bad habits to them, I often did so with a blaming tone, which led them to resist my suggestions and continue those habits for a long time. This experience has also made me reflect on how I should offer guidance with kindness rather than as criticism.\nMaster said in Teaching Given on Lantern Festival Day, 2003:\n“... Whether you respect me or not, as your Master, I really, truly don’t mind. Back then, as I was saving you, a lot of you were cursing at me. There were people who were cursing at me even while at my classes. I don’t mind. I just want to save you. (Applause) What I’m trying to say is, personally I don’t mind at all how you treat Master. I’m not affected by any factors at any level of the cosmos. But there’s one problem, which is, if you don’t respect Master, it’s wrong according to the principles of the cosmos, and the old forces will take advantage of the gap and destroy you because of this. They will have seized the biggest excuse to destroy you, since they have seen the entire process of my saving you.\n“Whether you treat me well or not, I don’t mind in the least, but the old forces will destroy you in the tribulation. Watch out!”\nLet us take Master’s reminder to heart and cultivate with sincerity and respect.\nArticles in which cultivators share their understandings typically reflect an individual's perception at a point in time based on their cultivation state, and they are offered in the spirit of enabling mutual elevation.\nCopyright © 1999-2025 Minghui.org.
