  "text": "Cardinal Bo prays for priest brutally killed in Myanmar, appeals for end to violence\nBy Deborah Castellano Lubov\n\"May the blood and sacrifices of countless innocent people, along with Father Donald Martin Ye Naing Win, serve as an offering to ending the violence that is occurring throughout the Nation.\"\nCardinal Charles Maung Bo, the President of Myanmar's Bishops' Conference, expressed this in a message on condolences he sent for the death of Father Donald Martin Ye Naing Win, who was killed by an armed group as the conflict persists between Myanmar’s military and resistance forces.\nEarlier this month, Myanmar's military junta bombed the Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic Church in Mindat, a locality in Burma's northwestern Chin State. It was the church chosen as the cathedral of the newly-established diocese of Mindat, which Pope Francis had created on 25 January.\nThe new cathedral, hit on 6 February, was rendered unusable after aerial bombardments damaged its roof and stained glass windows. There were no injuries in the bombing, because the priests and faithful had already left the area due to the poor security conditions and the ongoing fighting.\n'Earnest appeal to end the violence'\nIn his note of condolences for Father Donald, Cardinal Bo states, \"We received the news that Father Donald Martin Ye Naing Win, a priest of the Catholic Archdiocese of Mandalay, was brutally murdered by a group of armed men on the evening of Friday, February 14, 2025. We are deeply shocked and saddened by the news.\nThe Catholic Church throughout Myanmar, together with Mandalay's Archbishop Marco Tin Win, the priests, the religious, the faithful of the Archdiocese of Mandalay and the late Burmese priest's parents and relatives, the head of the Church in Myanmar acknowledged, are mourning his loss.\n\"May God the Father, the Lord of all life,\" Cardinal Bo prayed, \"comfort your mourning hearts and ours.\"\n\"Learning from these heartbreaking experiences that we have encountered,\" he implored, \"may the fraternal spirit be awakened, and we earnestly appeal for an end to the violence.\"\nPreventing such incidents in the future\nThe wrongdoing committed against Father Donald Martin Ye Naing Win, Cardinal Bo insisted, is not something that can be easily forgotten.\n\"Therefore,\" he stressed, \"we urge those responsible to take appropriate action and ensure justice is served, so that such incidents do not occur again in the future.\"\n\"May the soul of Father Donald Martin Ye Naing Win through the mercy of God,\" he concluded, \"rest in eternal peace!\"\nStrong condemnation of every attack\nIn addition to Cardinal Bo's condolences, the Apostolic Nunciature in Myanmar also expressed its despair over the priest's killing, reported LiCAS.news.\nThe Chargé d’Affaires of the Nunciature, Msgr. Andrea Ferrante, expressed his \"profound sadness\" and \"strongly condemned every attack on life and human dignity\" and \"all forms of violence as a means of resolving conflicts.”\nThe diplomat urged priests, religious, and missionaries in the Archdiocese, despite the dangers, to stand firm in their mission.\n“Rooted in His love,\" Msgr. Ferrante encouraged, \"may each one be a sign of the merciful presence of the Father who welcomes His children and heals their wounds,” he added.\nThank you for reading our article.
