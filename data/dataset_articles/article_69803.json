  "text": "VATICAN CITY - Doctors have changed treatment for Pope Francis' respiratory tract infection to tackle a \"complex clinical situation\" and he will remain in hospital for as long as necessary, the Vatican said on Monday.\n\"The results of the tests carried out in recent days and today have demonstrated a polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract, which has led to a further modification of the therapy,\" said a brief statement.\n\"All tests conducted up to today are indicative of a complex clinical picture that will require an appropriate hospital stay,\" it said.\nThe 88-year-old pontiff has been suffering from a respiratory infection for more than a week and was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Friday.\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the pontiff was \"in good spirits\". He did not specify whether the pope was suffering from a bacterial or viral infection, but said a further update on the pope's condition would be issued later on Monday.\nWhile a bacterial infection can be treated with antibiotics, viral infections cannot. Viruses usually have to run their course, but the patient can be assisted with other medicines to bring down their fever or help their body fight the infection.\nA polymicrobial infection is one caused by two or more micro-organisms, and can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.\nThe Vatican said on Monday that the pope's planned weekly audience in St. Peter's Square, set for Wednesday, had been cancelled \"due to the continued hospitalization of the Holy Father\".\nThe pope's doctors had earlier ordered complete rest, and Francis was unable to deliver his regular weekly prayer on Sunday to pilgrims in St Peter's Square or lead a special Mass for artists to mark the Catholic Church's Jubilee Year.\n'QUITE WORRIED' BY POPE'S ABSENCE\nPilgrims visiting the Vatican on Monday offered their hopes that Francis would recover soon.\n\"We certainly wish for him to get better very quickly,\" said Rev. Tyler Carter, a Catholic priest from the United States. \"He is our father and our shepherd, and so we want his continued health and blessing.\"\nManuel Rossi, a tourist from Milan, Italy, said he was \"quite worried\" when the pope cancelled his appearance on Sunday.\n\"I am 18 years old so I have seen few popes in my life, and am very close to him,\" said Rossi. \"I hope he recovers as soon as possible.\"\nWhile in hospital over the weekend, the pope continued his recent practice of making phone calls to speak with members of a Catholic parish in Gaza, Italian broadcaster Mediaset reported on Monday.\nOne of the parish members said Francis had called on both Friday and Saturday and was in \"good spirits\" but sounded \"a bit tired\".\n\"Thank you for the affection, prayer and closeness with which you accompany me in these days,\" the pope wrote on X on Sunday.
