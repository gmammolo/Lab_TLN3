  "text": "CV NEWS FEED // The Diocese of Joliet, Illinois is closing and merging parishes across the diocese as a result of declining Mass attendance, donations, and an aging priest population.\nAccording to a press release from Bishop Ronald Hicks, the restructuring plan will affect 20 parishes and two worship sites. On July 1, 2025, the parishes will close or merge into 11 parishes and six worship sites.\nSome parishes affected in the consolidation include Chicago suburbs.\nThe Diocese of Joliet’s “Targeted Restructuring Plan” began in June 2022. Phase 1 of the plan was announced in March 2023 and Phase 2 was announced in January 2024.\nBishop Hicks stated that the new restructuring plan will include priest reassignments, which will be announced June 1.\nHe also stated that Phase 3 is the final stage of the restructuring plan. “However, that does not mean we remain static or complacent,” he added.\nThe bishop stated that the diocese “will continue to monitor the health and viability of our parishes, schools and ministries to make sure we are a vibrant, thriving Catholic Church that is dedicated to passing on our faith to the next generations.”\nBishop Hicks acknowledged that the transition would be difficult for many families, affecting where parishioners worship and how far they must drive to Mass. “With all my compassion, know that my prayers are with you on this new journey,” he wrote.\nHe also encouraged parishioners to invite the Holy Spirit into their hearts during the transition period, and welcome new parishioners into their communities.",
