  "text": "Alien Church? Isaiah Saldivar Uncovers Blasphemous UFO House of Worship\nWhat is an alien church, and why should Christians be wary of this phenomenon?\nIn a recent video, Christian speaker and evangelist Isaiah Saldivar exposed the disturbing theology behind an “alien church,” which claims that belief in Jesus is synonymous with believing in extraterrestrials. The church, based in Los Angeles, prominently displays an alien figure on a cross, twisting Christian doctrine to fit its narrative.\n“People are obsessed and fascinated with aliens,” Saldivar says.\nBreaking News. Spirit-Filled Stories. Subscribe to Charisma on YouTube now!\nShowing the clips of what the church looks like on the inside, there are statues of aliens dressed up in clergy attire, with photos of people bending down to worship the alien statue, appearing to shake his hand in reverence.\n“It’s just sad to see how demons have so deceived people,” Saldivar says.\nGet your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today! Stay up to date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more!\nCrucifixes with aliens on them can be seen throughout the building, another form of true mockery against the Christian faith. Saldivar asserts that these encounters are not alien in nature, but demonic in origin.\nBeyond its spiritual deception, the church is also involved in unusual technological and commercial practices. Leaders claim they are developing a microchip that can read blood pressure and impact human biology—an idea that raises concerns about parallels to the biblical “mark of the beast.”\nThe church also uses odd pins they believe will help them to have a greater time control ability, while others will help to “oxygenate” your body. These absurd items just go to show the kind of deception that the people in this church are actually under. Saldivar believes this type of deception will only increase in the last days, warning that the enemy is using such movements to lead people away from the gospel.\nNow is the time for believers to stand firm in biblical truth, engage in spiritual warfare and pray for those caught in the lies of the enemy.\nJoin Charisma Magazine Online to follow everything the Holy Spirit is doing around the world!\nAbby Trivett is content development editor for Charisma Media.",
