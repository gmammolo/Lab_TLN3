  "text": "BISMARCK, ND ( KXNET ) — State lawmakers recently said ‘no’ to two Christian-related policies that were proposed in the legislature. House representatives voted down House Bill 1145 , which was seeking to display the 10 Commandments in school classrooms and on college campuses. The House also rejected House Bill 1456 , which hoped to allow chaplains in public schools. Supporters argued both bills could teach students moral values and help reduce behavioral and mental health problems. Opponents say they don’t want students being indoctrinated in class. “I’m glad that other people kind of rose their voices of this was something that our public school funds shouldn’t be going towards and our students need all aspects and all thoughts to be presented to them. And really, the Ten Commandments or chaplains. That’s something parents can provide and have that control over,” Jessica Van Winkle from ND United said. The school chaplain bill failed by a vote of 35-46 on Friday. Thanks for signing up! Watch for us in your inbox.
