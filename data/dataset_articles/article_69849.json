  "text": "Vatican: the Pope, hospitalized, presents “a complex clinical picture”\nPublished\nVaticanThe pope, hospitalized, presents “a complex clinical picture”\nThe results of the examinations carried out in recent days and today have shown a polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract.\nPope Francis, hospitalized since Friday in Rome, has a “complex clinical picture”, the Vatican announced on Monday, indicating that the hospitalization of the 88 -year -old pontiff should continue until at least on Wednesday.\n“The results of the examinations carried out to date have demonstrated a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection which has led to a new modification of the therapy,” said the health bulletin published in mid-day.\nThe Vatican did not communicate on the date on which the Pope is expected to leave the Gemelli Hospital in Rome, but announced on Monday that his hospitalization led to the cancellation of his general weekly audience on Wednesday.\nIn the morning, the Vatican had reported reassuring news, the director of the Holy See press service, Matteo Bruni, saying that the Pope had “spent a quiet night” and was “in a good mood”.\n“This morning, he had breakfast and devoted himself as always to reading certain newspapers,” he added, adding that the treatments were following their course.\nThe Vatican said in the evening in a new press release that the Pope’s state of health was unchanged and that he had no fever, adding that François had worked in the morning.\nBefore his hospitalization on Friday, François, to whom a part of a lung when he was young, had appeared weakened, with a swollen face, his voice breathless, and had repeatedly delegated the reading of his speeches to his assistants.\n“No alarm”\n“The last two weeks, the calendar was overloaded, it was weakened,” a source confirmed to AFP within the entourage of the Pope. But according to this source, “there is no alarmism” on the side of the Holy See as to the state of the head of the Church.\nKnown for his strong character sometimes stubborn, the Pope prefers to “go ahead”, at the risk of putting his health to the test.\nSunday, the bishop of Rome followed mass on television, missing his weekly prayer of the Angelus. The Vatican said at the end of the afternoon that his clinical condition was “stable”.\nAccording to Italian media, the Pope has maintained his hospital calls from his hospital calls to the parish of Gaza from his hospital.\nThe hospitalization of the Argentinian pontiff, the fourth in less than four years, however relaunched questions about her fragile health, especially since she intervenes at the beginning of the jubilee year of the Catholic Church, marked by a long list of events, many of which are chaired by the Pope.\nHip problems, knee pain, operations, respiratory infections: Jorge Bergoglio has experienced several health problems in recent years.\nMore recently, he appeared in mid-January the arm in a sling, immobilized after a fall at his residence. In December, he appeared with a large hematoma at the bottom of the chin after hitting his bedside table.\nDespite these repeated alerts, the Pope, who moves in a wheelchair, maintains a very busy schedule and said he had no intention to slow down his pace.\n(afp)",
