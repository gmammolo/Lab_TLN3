  "text": "diocese of Mindat\nMindat (Agenzia Fides) - The Myanmar army has carried out air strikes that have seriously damaged the Catholic church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Mindat, in the state of Chin, in the northwest of the country. This church had recently been chosen as the cathedral of the diocese of Mindat, erected on January 25 by Pope Francis, separating the territory from the diocese of Hakha.\nAccording to local sources of Fides, in recent months Mindat has been the scene of clashes between the Chinland Defence Force (CDF) and the Myanmar army. The CDF, which emerged in opposition to the military junta, managed to take control of the territory and, in January, officially declared the area as “liberated”. In several border regions, these militias have allied themselves with ethnic armed groups that have been fighting for greater autonomy for decades.\nThe bombing of the cathedral took place on February 6, but news of it has only just come to light. Several bombs hit the building, damaging the roof and stained glass windows, rendering it unusable. No injuries were reported, as priests and faithful had left the area due to insecurity and fighting. In recent days, local priests had carried out inspections of the church to plan for upcoming liturgical celebrations, including the consecration of the newly appointed bishop, Father Augustine Thang Zawm Hung, until now parish vicar of the Sacred Heart in Mindat. The attack has caused consternation among the faithful, although the community has expressed its determination to repair the church. “We are very sad that our church has been hit by the bombs. It is a wound in our heart. But we will not let ourselves be defeated. We will rebuild it,” said the local priest, Fr. Paulinus. “We are certain that the Lord will ‘bombard’ us with his grace and blessing: this will bring peace and prosperity to our people.” The diocese of Mindat, located in the south of Chin State, has a population of about 360,000 inhabitants, of whom about 15,000 are Catholics, in a region that is predominantly Christian of other denominations. The diocese has 23 parishes, 48 diocesan priests, three religious men, 21 nuns, as well as 40 minor seminarians and seven major seminarians. As the faithful of Chin face these difficult times, in the archdiocese of Yangon a special jubilee pilgrimage was held on February 9 to the Marian shrine of Nyaungbelin, in the Bago region, on the occasion of the feast of Our Lady of Lourdes. More than 3,000 people took part in the pilgrimage, praying for peace and entrusting themselves to the Virgin Mary.\n“Bishops, priests, religious and Catholic faithful, together with Buddhists, Muslims and Hindus, have prayed to Our Lady of Lourdes for peace in Myanmar and in the world,” said a statement from the diocese.
