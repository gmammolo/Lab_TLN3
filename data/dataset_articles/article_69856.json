  "text": "Reverend Stephen Adom Kyei-Duah, the Founder of Believers’ Worship Centre, has advised Pastors and prophets not to use their positions to beg for money from their congregation.\nHe said the power to prophesy, see vision and explain dreams should not give them license to collect money from people.\nHe noted that “Once someone starts preaching, they call themselves Pastors, establish churches and collect money from people in the name of Offertory and Tithes”.\nRev. Kyei-Duah gave the advice in a Sermon under the theme: “What is all about Pastorship,” Acts 2:16-21″ which was telecast live and monitored by the Ghana News Agency (GNA).\nReading from Acts 2:17, he said “in the last days, God says, I will pour out my spirit on all people. Your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams,” and that for one to see visions, prophesy, preach and explained dreams was God’s own plan.\nRev. Kyei-Duah, also known as “The Voice of God,” said Pastorship should not be used for scandalous, defaming and defrauding people, as “we are all the same before the Lord.”\nHe added that when one becomes a Pastor and tends to depend on others for money, he destroys the plans of God.\nHe therefore charged the so-called Pastors to consider the well-being of their followers rather than themselves.\nHome - News\nElection 2024\nTWI News | TV\nPolls\nPress Release\nNews Blogs\nNews Archive\nCrime & Punishment\nPolitics\nNews\nYou are here: → → → Article 1971930",
