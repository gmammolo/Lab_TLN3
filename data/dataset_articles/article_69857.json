  "text": "A historic church in North Philadelphia near Girard College sustained heavy damage due to a fire on Monday night. The fire happened at the United Baptist Church, which was built in 1892, at the intersection of North 25th and West Thompson streets. About 60 Philadelphia Fire Department firefighters responded to the scene just after 7:30 p.m. They plan on being at the scene overnight to put out hot spots as smoke continues to come out of the church. Deputy Chief Charles Johnson of the Philadelphia Fire Department said nobody was injured in the blaze and that no one was inside when the fire started. Johnson said because of the cold weather and the amount of water firefighters were using, the department will have to cut power in the area. It could impact up to three blocks surrounding the fire, Johnson said. He said the Philadelphia Office OF Emergency Management will respond to the scene if anyone is displaced. Johnson said he wasn't concerned about windy conditions spreading embers to nearby homes on Monday night. The cause of the fire is under investigation. Johnson said the fire marshall is investigating the incident. Janet Walker, who lives nearby, said United Baptist Church is her family's church. She said her husband grew up in the area and knows the pastor. She added losing the church is a big loss for the community.",
