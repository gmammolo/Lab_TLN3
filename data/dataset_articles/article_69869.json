  "text": "Decline of Francis’ Church: Participation in the Angelus Prayer (2000-2025)\nAs everyone has seen, participation in the Angelus prayer has decreased significantly during the pontificate of Francis. Epistles.online published statistics (February 8).\nDuring the last years of John Paul II (2000-2005), participation in the Angelus remained high, with an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 people.\nThe Jubilee of 2000 and the frequent canonizations also contributed to an increased number of pilgrims in Rome.\nUnder Benedict XVI, Angelus attendance remained respectable, but lower than in the peak years of John Paul II. It averaged between 15,000 and 30,000 per week.\nBy 2011 and 2012, attendance had declined further, with estimates ranging from 10,000 to 20,000 per Angelus.\nBenedict's last Angelus in 2013 drew an enormous crowd, with more than 50,000 in attendance.\nFrancis' election in March 2013 initially sparked enthusiasm. His first Angelus drew huge crowds, with 60,000 in attendance.\nHis early years saw some of the highest Angelus attendance numbers in decades, with 2013 and 2014 averaging over 50,000 attendees per week.\nHowever, as his papacy progressed, attendance began to decline. In 2015, the numbers had dropped to 30,000-40,000, and in 2017-2019 to 15,000-25,000.\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 restrictions led to a complete cessation of Angelus gatherings.\nWhen the restrictions were eased in 2021-2022, attendance did not recover, averaging between 10,000 and 20,000 - one of the lowest in recent history.\nSince 2023, the declining Angelus attendance has dropped to a few thousand, peaking at just over 10,000.\n\"Under Francis, the situation has changed dramatically,\" as he has seen \"the most significant decline,\" the author comments.\nPicture: epistles.online,\nDuring the last years of John Paul II (2000-2005), participation in the Angelus remained high, with an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 people.\nThe Jubilee of 2000 and the frequent canonizations also contributed to an increased number of pilgrims in Rome.\nUnder Benedict XVI, Angelus attendance remained respectable, but lower than in the peak years of John Paul II.
