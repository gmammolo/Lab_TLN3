  "text": "Pope Francis: Vatican cancels the pontiff's weekend engagements\nThe Vatican has cancelled Pope Francis's weekend engagements as the elderly pontiff battles a \"complex\" respiratory infection.\nThe 88-year-old has been\nin Rome's Gemelli hospital since Friday for bronchitis treatment.On Monday, the Vatican said his respiratory tract infection was presenting a \"complex clinical picture\" and he would need to remain in hospital.\nThat evening, the Vatican said the Pope was in a \"stable\" condition with no fever.\nSpokesperson Matteo Bruni previously said the results of tests conducted in recent days indicate the pontiff is suffering from a \"polymicrobial respiratory tract infection\" that needed a further change in his drug therapy.\nPolymicrobial infections are caused by a mix of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites.\nThe Vatican said that, despite his illness,\nFrancis\"read and worked\" on Monday morning and said he was \"touched by the numerous messages of affection and closeness that he continues to receive in these hours\".Concerns have been growing about the pontiff's increasingly frail health.\nFrancis, who has been pontiff since 2013, has had influenza and other health problems several times over the past two years.\nPilgrims arriving at the Vatican this week have offered their prayers that the pope would recover soon.\n\"We certainly wish for him to get better very quickly,\" said Reverend Tyler Carter, a Catholic priest from the US. \"He is our father and our shepherd, and so we want his continued health and blessing.\"\n© Sky News | Vatican cancels the Pope's weekend engagements",
