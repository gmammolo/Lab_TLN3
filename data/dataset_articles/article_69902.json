Updated February 18th, 2025 at 11:25 am (Europe\\Rome) Father Donald Martin served in the Archdiocese of Mandalay.

Father Donald Martin Ye Naing Win, the first Catholic priest killed in this conflict, was found dead Feb. 14 near his Our Lady of Lourdes Parish in the Archdiocese of Mandalay.\nThe mutilated body of the 44-year-old priest, who was ordained in 2018, was discovered at 6 a.m. in Kan Gyi Taw village, according to the Vatican’s Fides news agency. His remains were left in a forested area near his parish. Authorities have launched an investigation to determine which armed group was responsible.\nFurther reading: Catholic church in Myanmar’s Chin State bombed amid ongoing conflict \"May the blood and sacrifices of countless innocent people, along with Father Donald Martin Ye Naing Win, serve as an offering to ending the violence that is occurring throughout the Nation,\" Cardinal Charles Bo, president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Myanmar, said in a statement. Father Martin, whose ordination motto was drawn from the Gospel of John — \"Do you truly love me more than these? Feed my lambs\" — shed his blood in an effort to end the violence devastating Myanmar , the cardinal said. He urged authorities to ensure justice is served and to prevent future attacks.\nFuneral, a shocked community The murder has shocked the local Catholic community, which is seeking answers amid the ongoing violence between opposition militias and the Myanmar military. The Sagaing region is one of the most affected by clashes between the People's Defense Forces and the army.\nMore than 5,000 people gathered in Pyin Oo Lwin, despite ongoing violence, to honor Father Donald Martin in his parish of Our Lady of Lourdes in the Archdiocese of Mandalay. His Feb. 16 funeral was held in his hometown at the Church of the Assumption, where Archbishop Marco Tin Win presided, surrounded by priests, religious, and faithful. The archbishop read messages of condolence from the Apostolic Nunciature and Myanmar’s bishops, expressing deep solidarity with the grieving community.\nArchbishop Tin Win urged the faithful to wake up “because violence only brings death and destruction, it is always a defeat,” and appealed “to all armed groups and actors involved in the conflict to lay down their weapons and take a path of peace and reconciliation.” He entrusted Father Donald and his family to the Virgin Mary: “May Our Lady accompany him to paradise and protect all under her mantle, giving comfort and hope.”\nFurther reading: New bishop brings hope to Myanmar’s war-torn Kachin state Father Martin was devoted to education, organizing informal classes for children amid school closures caused by the conflict. He also provided humanitarian aid to displaced people, offering both spiritual and material assistance. The People’s Defense Forces (PDF), which control the area, have arrested 10 men from Kan Gyi Taw as part of their investigation into his murder. The suspects have been transferred to a court in a PDF-controlled “liberated area” outside the military junta’s authority.\nSince the military coup of 2021, which ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, the PDF has been fighting the junta, triggering mass displacement. The Kachin region, where Father Martin was murdered, has one of the country’s largest Catholic populations, with 34% identifying as Catholic. Myanmar, a majority-Buddhist nation of more than 54 million people, is home to a Christian minority comprising 6% of the population, with Catholics making up about 3%.\nCondolences from the Vatican The Holy See expressed “sincere and heartfelt condolences” to the family, religious communities, and faithful of the Archdiocese of Mandalay. In a message to Archbishop Marco Tin Win, Msgr. Andrea Ferrante, the Vatican’s chargé d’affaires in Myanmar, assured prayers “for the eternal rest of the priest who was the victim of unjustified violence .”\nFurther reading: Military junta in Myanmar has lost legitimacy, but not power Read during Father Martin’s funeral, the message expressed solidarity with the local Catholic community and encouraged priests, religious, and missionaries to “continue their mission with zeal, despite all difficulties, following the example of Jesus, the Good Shepherd.” It urged the faithful to remain “rooted in his love” and to be “signs of the merciful presence of the Father who welcomes his children and heals their wounds.” The suffering community was entrusted to the Blessed Virgin Mary, described as “the certainty of our hope,” to sustain the Burmese people in “communion, unity, and solidarity.”\nMyanmar Persecuted christians militia military",
