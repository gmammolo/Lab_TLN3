  "text": "Akshay Kumar ’s recently released devotional song Mahakal Chalo has landed in controversy after a priest association accused it of misrepresenting Sanatan Dharma. The association’s president, Mahesh Sharma , expressed his disapproval over certain visuals in the music video, particularly scenes where Akshay embraces a Shivling and has panchamrit abhishek performed on him.\nTalking to News 18, Sharma stated, \"While the song itself is good, some of the visuals are inappropriate. In the video, Akshay Kumar is seen embracing Shivling, which is not acceptable. Additionally, bhasma (sacred ash) is being offered in a way that does not align with tradition. Only Ujjain’s Mahakal temple follows the ritual of offering bhasma, and creating a film set version of it is an insult to Sanatan Dharma.\"\nMahakal Chalo is a devotional song featuring Akshay Kumar in collaboration with singer Dr. Palash Sen . Released earlier today, the song also features renowned choreographer Ganesh Acharya. The music video showcases Akshay and Palash expressing their devotion to Lord Shiva through energetic performances.\nPalash Sen, speaking about the collaboration, praised Akshay Kumar’s dedication and humility. \"Despite being a superstar, he remains humble and deeply respectful. He had memorized the entire song before we even started shooting, while I was still struggling with the lyrics. Though he insists he’s not a singer, I must say, he has a natural gift for it,\" said Palash.\nMeanwhile, on the work front, Akshay Kumar will soon be seen in 'Bhooth Bangla', directed by Priyadarshan. The film, which also stars Tabu and Paresh Rawal, is set to hit theatres on April 2, 2026. Actress Wamiqa Gabbi is also rumored to be a part of the cast.\nOn the other hand, Akshay Kumar was last seen in the multi starrer ‘ Singham Again’.\nBehind the scenes of ISPL 2025 final as Majhi Mumbai crowned champion!\nAbout the Author TOI Entertainment Desk The TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.
