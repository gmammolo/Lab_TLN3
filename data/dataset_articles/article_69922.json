  "text": "Fraud: Blood Tears of the Madonna of Trevignano\nGisella Cardia - an Italian woman who claims to receive visions of Our Lady in Trevignano Romano, a town near Rome - is facing possible fraud charges.\nIn 2016, after a pilgrimage to Medjugorje, Bosnia-Herzegovina, she reported that a statue of the Virgin Mary she brought back from there began shedding tears of blood. These events attracted pilgrims and led to monthly prayer meetings.\nCardia also set up a foundation to collect donations, which she said would be used to build a center for sick children.\nIn March 2024, Bishop Marco Salvi of the diocese of Civita Castellana declared the alleged apparitions \"not supernatural,\" citing theological inconsistencies in the messages.\nA private investigator found that the blood on the statue came from a pig. He triggered a judicial investigation.\nProsecutors opened a fraud investigation against Cardia in 2023 and ordered the lab tests from a forensic geneticist.\nThese recent forensic analyses revealed that the blood on the statue matched Cardia's own DNA, reports Corriere.it (February 13).\nDespite these findings, Gisella Cardia is sticking to her story. Cardia's lawyer, Solange Marchignoli, suggested that the presence of Cardia's DNA does not rule out a supernatural phenomenon.\nCardia has reportedly left Trevignano, but it is unclear where she is now.\nShe has a previous conviction for bankruptcy fraud.\nIn 2016, after a pilgrimage to Medjugorje, Bosnia-Herzegovina, she reported that a statue of the Virgin Mary she brought back from there began shedding tears of blood.
