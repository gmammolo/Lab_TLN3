  "text": "(SRN NEWS) – Ever since 1558, members of Parliament have paused at the beginning of each daily session to ask God’s guidance and blessing on their proceedings.\nBut now a group of lawmakers are urging the House of Commons to end the practice, calling it “outmoded, outdated and not compatible with 21st century society.”\nApparently both liberals and conservatives want an end to prayer.\nRoughly half of the current Parliament is non-Christian.",
