  "text": "Will the Trump administration choose confrontation with Pope Francis?\nPope Francis strongly opposed Donald Trump’s immigration policy in a letter to the American bishops. The reaction of a close associate of the American president, asking Francis to \"stay out of border issues,\" crystallizes a deep crisis, explains researcher Benoît Gautier.\nU.S. Vice President J. D. Vance was in Paris February 11 for the International Summit on AI, defending major American tech companies against the European Union’s regulatory ambitions. He was likely unaware that he was about to face another form of regulation—this time, a doctrinal one. Around 12:30 p.m., the Vatican released a letter addressed to the American bishops. There is no doubt that the very Catholic vice president was also among its recipients.\nVance, who converted to Catholicism five years ago, made headlines January 26 by defending Trump’s immigration policies in the face of protests from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. He attacked the bishops head-on, suggesting that their criticisms were financially motivated. The Trump administration had just abruptly cut federal funding to the church, which contracts with Catholic associations to provide some migrant assistance services.\nPope Francis openly opposes Trump’s immigration policy\n\"As a devoted Catholic, I was heartbroken by their statements. I think that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops needs to actually look in the mirror a little bit and recognize that when they receive over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants, are they worried about humanitarian concerns? Or are they actually worried about their bottom line?\" Vance insinuated. His statement drew the ire of the very conservative Cardinal Dolan of New York, who had offered a prayer on behalf of Catholics at President Trump’s inauguration.\nVance, the 'chief catechist' of Trumpists\nOn January 30, Vance defended his position by invoking the principle of Ordo amoris, a doctrine inspired by Saint Augustine, which he defined as prioritizing love for one’s socially closest neighbors before focusing on more distant ones:\n\"You love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country. And then after that, you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.\"\nPut in more prosaic terms, \"charity begins at home.\" The statement delighted Trump-supporting Catholics, with one publication even bestowing upon Vance the title of \"chief catechist.\"\nThe pope’s letter encouraged American bishops to stand firm alongside migrants in their confrontation with the Trump administration, even as some bishops, despite their reservations, had publicly aligned themselves with the doctrine espoused by the vice president. In fact, just minutes after the Vatican’s letter was published, the website Word on Fire, run by the highly influential Bishop Robert Barron, released a defense and illustration of Vance’s exegesis.\nThe article’s introduction directly contradicted the pope’s text word for word. Although this collision of publications is highly likely accidental—Word on Fire’s piece was probably prepared several days in advance—this coincidence is a brutally revealing sign of the Vatican's direct opposition to certain highly influential factions of the U.S. Church.\nChallenging the pope’s legitimacy\nThe tone of the pope’s message reveals a form of frustration with the vice president’s ambitions to position himself as an interpreter of Catholic doctrine. Without naming him, the text directly targets Vance, stating that his interpretation of Ordo amoris reflects a form of individualism that is incompatible with the anthropology upheld by the church:\n\"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups (…). The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the 'Good Samaritan,' that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception,\" the pope wrote.\nVance was converted within the milieu of Catholic integralists, who advocate for the subordination of political power to spiritual authority. Will the vice president and the Catholic faction he represents accept this public admonition, or will they choose confrontation? The response from Tom Homan, a self-proclaimed Catholic and the official in charge of implementing Trump’s immigration policy, suggested that their strategy might be to challenge the pope’s legitimacy to speak on political matters.\nAs has happened before, the strategy draws an impermeable boundary between the pope’s legitimate domain—doctrine—and political affairs, urging the pontiff to stay in his lane. However, this approach may not suffice, given that Vance and his allies fundamentally reject the separation between doctrine and politics. Moreover, the vice president himself recklessly ventured into the Vatican’s domain by attempting to justify his policies through an interpretation of Catholic doctrine.",
