  "text": "The Sunday Times reports that bishops are openly talking about disestablishment of the Church of England in the wake of the child sexual abuse scandal which led to the resignation of Archbishop Justin Welby – along with calls for his successor, Archbishop Stephen Cottrell, to do the same.\nAccording to the article, the mood within the Church of England is seen as one of ‘breaking point’ following a vote by the Church of England’s General Synod not to approve independent safeguarding – meaning the Church will continue to privately handle allegations of child sexual abuse without external oversight, which was seen as a major cause of the Church’s failings under Welby.\nMounting internal criticisms\nBishop of Newcastle Helen-Ann Hartley said the vote means the Church has ‘lost credibility in safeguarding… we have just collectively signed our institutional death warrant’ and ‘demonstrated a fundamental lack of understanding of the depth of this crisis’.\nThe Church of England’s safeguarding lead, Bishop of Birkenhead, Julie Conalty, said the scandal ‘exemplified the arrogance’ of the Church’s approach and refusal to ‘listen to criticism from experts [and] survivors.’\nCall for disestablishment, end of bishops in Lords\nConalty said: ‘Part of our inherent arrogance comes with our status as the established Church… I personally would favour the Church of England being disestablished.’\nJournalist Cathy Newman summarised Hartley as saying the Church had ‘forfeited its right to its special status as the established church in England, the official religion of the nation with the monarch as its supreme governor.’\nThe Rev Robert Thompson agreed, saying ‘a liberal secular democracy shouldn’t have bishops automatically sitting in the House of Lords and deciding our laws’.\nRev Thompson said:\n‘Disestablishment would be a big shake-up symbolically but I don’t think it’s an enormous shake-up in practice, in terms of how our nation operates. It simply puts the church in its proper place in a society which is more plural and diverse.’\nMeanwhile Oxford Emeritus Professor of History of the Church Diarmaid MacCulloch told the Sunday Times:\n‘Just chuck ’em out. They’ve not contributed much in recent years, they don’t represent Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales. It is well said that only Iran otherwise includes clerics in its legislative bodies.’\nHumanists UK position\nHumanists UK wants to see the UK become a secular state where no religion or belief has special treatment in law or policy. This would mean an end to the Church of England’s established status, including the practice of appointing 26 bishops to the House of Lords – an archaic holdover seen in no other democratic sovereign states anywhere in the world.\nIt recently worked with Baroness Harman, Lord Birt, Lord Scriven, and Baroness Meacher on a proposed amendment to Labour’s Lords reform legislation that sought to remove these undemocratic voting privileges. It has also worked with the All-Party Parliamentary Humanist Group in recent weeks to highlight the discriminatory impact of Parliament using Anglican prayers as a system for booking seats for busy debates – which indirectly disadvantages non-religious MPs.\nHumanists UK has also urged the UK Government to implement the recommendations of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse.\nNotes\nFor further comment or information, media should contact Humanists UK Director of Public Affairs and Policy Richy Thompson at press@humanists.uk or phone 0203 675 0959.\nRead more about our work on disestablishment and bishops in the House of Lords.\nSee our previous articles about calls for Church of England disestablishment over same-sex marriage:\nHumanists UK is the national charity working on behalf of non-religious people. Powered by over 130,000 members and supporters, we advance free thinking and promote humanism to create a tolerant society where rational thinking and kindness prevail.
