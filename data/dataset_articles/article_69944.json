  "text": "Reaching consensus on contentious issues can be exhausting in a pluralistic country like India. On Monday, the Supreme Court deferred the hearing on a batch of pleas relating to the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act 1991, to April. It expressed displeasure over multiple fresh petitions challenging the law's validity. The court's response is reassuring.The Act mandates that the religious character of a place be maintained as it existed on August 15, 1947. In 2022, the court observed that investigating the religious character of a place of worship was not barred under the law. This sent a wrong signal to lower courts, society and the political establishment, opening the floodgates for more litigation. A year later, it allowed ASI to conduct a scientific survey at the Gyanvapi mosque to ascertain whether it was built on a temple. But, in 2024, the top court stalled proceedings in about 18 lawsuits seeking surveys to determine the original religious character of 10 mosques.Compounding the issue is GoI's reluctance to file a counter-affidavit in response to challenges against the law. While the incentive for taking a clear stance is low for obvious political reasons, the institutional damage from allowing courts and governance mechanisms to be choked by regressive, divisive litigation in circa 2025 India is significant. Such a competitive spree of pleas stifles real progress, making the 'radicalised' citizenry miss viksit for mandirs. Political machinations, coupled with underemployment, can make for a flammable combination that's not just digressive from all that talk of 'Viksit Bharat', but downright regressive. Choking courts with yearnings is a sign of a democracy sputtering on its path to a prosperous future.",
