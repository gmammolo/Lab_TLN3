  "text": "Pope Francis will not participate in this weekend’s Holy Year events as he remains in hospital for a “complex” respiratory infection, the Vatican announced on Tuesday. The 88-year-old pontiff has been battling the illness for over a week and was admitted to Rome’s Gemelli Hospital on February 14.\nThe Vatican confirmed that all public events on the pope’s schedule have been cancelled through Sunday. However, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni reassured the public that Francis had slept peacefully overnight and eaten breakfast on Tuesday. A further update on his condition is expected later in the day.\nA Vatican official, speaking anonymously, clarified that the pope is not on a ventilator and is breathing on his own.\nPope Francis had been scheduled to lead several events for the 2025 Catholic Holy Year, which extends through to next January. The Holy Year is a significant period for Catholics, marked by themes of pardon and forgiveness. The Vatican anticipates that 32 million pilgrims will visit Rome throughout the year, with many looking forward to special audiences with the pontiff.\nThe Vatican revealed on Monday that doctors had altered the pope’s drug therapy for the second time during his hospitalisation, describing his condition as a “polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract.” This type of infection involves multiple microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, or fungi.\nFrancis, who has served as pope since 2013, has faced recurring health issues in recent years. As a young adult, he developed pleurisy, leading to the partial removal of one lung. His history of lung infections has made him particularly vulnerable to respiratory illnesses.\nWhile the Vatican has not disclosed whether the infection is bacterial or viral, medical experts note that bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics, whereas viral infections typically require supportive care to help manage symptoms.\nThe Vatican has stated that Pope Francis will remain in hospital for as long as necessary. There is no confirmed timeline for his discharge, leaving questions about his ability to resume his full schedule in the coming weeks.\nAs the Holy Year unfolds, millions of Catholics worldwide continue to pray for the pope’s swift recovery, hoping he will soon be able to resume his pastoral duties.\nMelissa Enoch\nFollow us on:",
