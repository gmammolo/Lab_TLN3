  "text": "After BJP uproar over Telangana's Ramzan order, similar move by ally in Andhra\nThe Andhra Pradesh government has allowed Muslim employees to leave work an hour early during Ramzan, days after Telangana's Congress government issued a similar order, which the BJP slammed as \"appeasement politics\".\nIn Short\n- Andhra Pradesh allows Muslim employees to leave work early during Ramzan\n- Telangana issued a similar directive earlier, criticised by BJP as appeasement\n- Congress defends the move, citing historical precedence of such relaxations\nThe Andhra Pradesh government, led by Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP), has announced that Muslim employees can leave work an hour early during the holy month of Ramzan. The decision comes just days after neighbouring Telangana, under the Congress-led government, issued a similar directive - one that was swiftly criticised by the BJP as \"appeasement politics\".\nThe Telangana government had earlier permitted Muslim employees, including teachers, contract workers, and public sector staff, to leave at 4 pm from March 2 to March 31, barring essential duties.\nBJP MLA Raja Singh was quick to slam the move, accusing the Congress of favouritism. \"Telangana government allows early leave for Ramzan but ignores Hindu festivals. Equal rights for all, or none,\" he posted on social media, sharing a copy of the official circular.\nHowever, in an interesting turn, Andhra Pradesh - where the BJP's ally, the TDP, is in power-has now followed suit with a near-identical order. The state's directive allows all Muslim employees, including those on contract and working in village and ward secretariats, to leave an hour before closing time from March 2 to March 30 to perform religious rituals.\n\"The government permits all the employees who profess Islam, including teachers and persons hired on contract, outsourcing basis and also Village/Ward Secretaries, to leave their offices/ schools early by an hour before closing time on all working days during the Holy month of 'Ramzan', from 2nd March to 30th March to perform necessary rituals as per guidelines issued by the concerned authorities, except when their presence is required due to exigencies of services during the above said period,\" the order read.\nDefending Telangana's move, Congress leader and state government adviser on minority affairs, Mohammed Ali Shabbir, dismissed the BJP's criticism as selective outrage.\n\"The facility was given during the BRS regime. Many BJP governments also offer this in other states. It's not new and has been in place for years,\" he said, adding that governments routinely provide relaxations during festivals, including for Hindu celebrations like Ganesh Chaturthi and Bonalu.",
