  "text": "Non-brahmin priests allege exclusion from temple rituals\nTrichy: Two non-brahmin priests of Vayalur Murugan temple near Trichy have sent a petition to chief minister M K Stalin alleging that they have been excluded from performing temple consecration ceremonies. With the temple set to be consecrated by HR&CE department on Feb 19, the priests said in a petition that they were kept out of the special rituals as well on Tuesday.\nPetitioners S Jayabalan and S Prabhu, who completed training in the state-run archaka training schools in Tiruvannamalai and Palani respectively in 2007, said they were appointed by the HR&CE department as priests in Vayalur Murugan temple in Aug 2021. Though there are three sanctum sanctorums in the temple, they said they were permitted to conduct rituals only in the sub-shrines and not in the main sanctum sanctorum shrines. \"Now we are not allowed to take part in the special rituals in yagasalai (fire ritual hall) too,\" Jayabalan told TOI.\nThe priests urged the state govt to make provisions for them to be treated with dignity like other priests. Meanwhile, a peace talk was conducted at Srirangam taluk office on Tuesday between a section of villagers from Adavathur, Allithurai and Kumara Vayalur and officials of revenue and HR&CE departments. They discussed the demands of locals to conduct the consecration ceremony of the temple in Tamil. The demands of the two priests were also raised by the villagers. The HR&CE department was directed to employ the two priests in all events according to the govt order. The department also agreed to take necessary action to conduct the rituals in Tamil.",
