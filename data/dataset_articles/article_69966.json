  "text": "On Sunday, Feb. 16, the global leadership of Hillsong Church announced that Pastors Brenden and Jacqui Brown , leaders of Hillsong San Francisco , are transforming that campus into a separate, independent faith community. The name of the new church will be announced on Feb. 23.\nSam Lopez, lead pastor of Hillsong California, told congregants that “nothing happened” in a negative sense. Instead, he said, the Browns are “an incredible couple [who] have a vision…and God has asked them to take a step of faith.”\nHillsong leadership backs the move “100%,” Lopez added, and is “releasing them with full blessing and in unity and excitement.”\nRELATED: ‘A New Era’—Phil and Lucinda Dooley Named Hillsong Church’s Global Senior Pastors\nThe move was announced on Hillsong’s annual Mission Sunday. This year’s theme is Taking Another Step by Faith.\nSan Fran Split Leaves 2 Hillsong Campuses in CA With the loss of its San Francisco campus, Hillsong Church now has just five U.S. locations: Los Angeles and Orange County in California, as well as New York City, New Jersey, and Boston. Before a series of high-profile scandals rocked the Australia-based megachurch, it had 16 campuses in America.\nChurchLeaders has reported extensively on Hillsong’s trouble-filled past few years. Various scandals were also featured in the docuseries “ Hillsong: A Megachurch Exposed .”\nPhil Dooley, global senior pastor of Hillsong, acknowledged during his Feb. 16 sermon that “we’ve faced some challenges as a church.” Using biblical lessons from the life of Joshua, Dooley encouraged congregants to keep taking steps of faith and not to get discouraged.\nDooley then discussed the next step for Hillsong California, calling the announcement “kind of happy/sad but I think mainly happy.” He described the San Francisco campus as “healthy,” saying the Browns’ “leadership has made a lasting impact on our church.”\nRELATED: UPDATE: Brian Houston Announces Dallas Hillsong Closing After Pastors’ Misuse of Funds\nTo the couple and the church, Dooley said, “We love you, and we are committed to remaining in close relationship with you as we embark on this faithful journey together.”\nPastors Brenden & Jacqui Brown Separate From Hillsong Lopez, who has overseen all three Hillsong California campuses, offered more context about the move, saying it’s been under discussion for two years. The Browns approached him with their “fresh vision,” he said, and Hillsong leaders were just waiting for “the right time” to move forward.\nFor anyone who doubts his explanation or thinks it’s “too good to be true,” Lopez said, “That’s genuinely the full truth. We’re just excited, and part of my job is not to keep and to hoard and to try to build a little empire. My job is to see especially our staff step into the call of God on their life.”\nOn social media, Brenden and Jacqui Brown shared their excitement about “stepping into a new season as a new church!” They wrote, “God has been faithful in every step of our journey, and we believe He’s leading us into something fresh and full of purpose. While our name is changing, our heart remains the same—to love people and connect them to Jesus.”\nThe Browns thanked their church family as well as local and global Hillsong leaders. They encouraged worshipers to return on Feb. 23 “as we reveal the new name of our church and unpack the vision for what’s ahead!”",
