  "text": "Hillsong Church Loses Another US Campus\nHillsong Church announced that Hillsong San Francisco --- led by pastors Brenden and Jacqui Brown --- is separating from the Hillsong brand and will be independently run under a new name.\nPreviousy, Hillsong Church had 16 campuses in the US alone. However, with the scandals associated with Hillsong NYC Lead Pastor Carl Lentz in November 2020 over \"leadership issues\" and moral failures, including being unfaithful to his wife, Laura, the mega church now only has 5 American campuses left.\nHillsong Church Global Senior Pastor Phil Dooley has this to say, \"After much prayer and thoughtful consideration, we're announcing that Brenden and Jacqui Brown will be taking on the leadership of our church community in San Francisco as a separate church, so separating from what has been part of Hillsong California.\"\n\"We believe the time is right for this. This is an exciting season for the Browns and for our church in San Francisco, and we want to say how much we love Brenden and Jacqui, and we value their dedication, their sacrifice, and their commitment to pastoring and leading the Hillsong San Francisco community,\" he added.\nHillsong San Francisco leaders, who have served the Evangelical megachurch network for 24 years, has this to say about leaving the Hillsong brand. \"We're stepping into a new season as a new church! God has been faithful in every step of our journey, and we believe He's leading us into something fresh and full of purpose. While our name is changing, our heart remains the same-to love people and connect them to Jesus.\n\"We are so grateful for our @hillsong Church family, whose faith and investment have laid the foundation for this next season. A special thank you to our Global Senior Pastors @philldooley_ and @lucindadooley , California Lead Pastors @samlopez and @courtneylopez , and the Global Board for their leadership, love, and support.\"\nThe church will be announcing their new name next week. \"Join us next Sunday as we reveal the new name of our church and unpack the vision for what's ahead! We can't wait to step into this new season together. \"",
