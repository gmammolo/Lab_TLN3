  "text": "A North Dakota lawmaker votes no on a bill. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)\nBISMARCK ( North Dakota Monitor ) – North Dakota House members voted 59-31 Tuesday against a resolution declaring the kingship of Jesus Christ, with opponents predicting the vote would be used against them politically.\nHouse Concurrent Resolution 3020, sponsored by Rep. Nico Rios, R-Williston, is a nonbinding resolution that urges North Dakota to recognize Jesus Christ as king.\nRep. Don Longmuir, R-Stanley, said North Dakota is home to people of many different beliefs. He said the House Political Subdivisions Committee recommended voting no to the resolution because the country’s founding fathers did not support establishing a religion.\n“I personally am a Christian of the Lutheran persuasion, and declare Jesus Christ as my Savior and Lord,” Longmuir said. “But that is my decision, and not encouraged or directed by any law or resolution.”\nRep. Austen Schauer, R-West Fargo, said he’s offended by the resolution and said he expects political opponents will use it to campaign against legislators who don’t support it.\n“I believe this is a gotcha bill,” Schauer said. “If you’re a believer and you’ve dedicated your life, committed your life to Jesus and you vote against this, the public says, and your church says, ‘What’s wrong with you?’”\nRep. Jared Hendrix, R-Fargo, urged members to support the resolution. He said it doesn’t impose religion on others but affirms what most North Dakotans believe.\n“Virtually every challenge we face, many of which we address legislatively every day, would be better addressed while keeping in mind Christ’s message of love, respect and truth,” Hendrix said.\nPreviously, House members voted no to a bill that would have required the Ten Commandments be posted in North Dakota public schools and colleges.",
