  "text": "Pope Francis Near Death: The Vatican Prepares for Possible Papal Change.\nPope Francis Secures the Future of the Church Before Death\nPope Francis, aware of his impending death, is hurrying to secure the future of the church. This is reported by Politico, citing sources close to the Vatican.\nThe 88-year-old pontiff is in Rome's Gemelli hospital due to a respiratory infection. According to two individuals familiar with the situation, Francis is in severe pain and has personally expressed the belief that this Time he will not recover.\nThe Vatican press office reported that the pontiff's bronchitis has progressed to a 'polymicrobial infection' with a 'complex clinical picture.' Last Sunday, doctors forbade him from delivering the traditional morning Angelus address, which he rarely missed even during hospitalizations.\nBefore the deterioration of his health, Francis made several important appointments. On February 6, he extended the term of Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re as Dean of the College of Cardinals - this position is key in preparing for a possible conclave to elect a new pope.\nThe Pope also expedited the appointment of Sister Raffaella Petrini as Governor of the Vatican, which will take place on March 1. She will be the first woman in this position.\nSince 2013, Francis has sought to make the church more inclusive, opening key roles for women and the LGBTQ+ community, which has provoked a strong reaction from conservatives.\nRead also",
