  "text": "Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez (CNS/Pablo Esparza) The Vatican’s doctrine chief has delivered a pointed critique of gender ideology at a theological conference in Germany. Source: CNA.\nCardinal Victor Manuel Fernández, prefect of the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, addressed scholars on Monday at the Cologne School of Catholic Theology (KHKT) about gender ideology’s “claim to omnipotence”.\nSpeaking in German via video link, the cardinal rejected the notion that gender and bodily identity could be subject to radical change based on individual wishes and claims to freedom.\nTransgender surgery, he argued, goes beyond mere external changes like cosmetic surgery, as it involves “the claim to a change of identity, to the desire to be a different person”.\nCardinal Fernández criticised using technical means to “create an alternative reality at will”.\nWhile acknowledging the existence of severe cases of dysphoria that could lead to “an unbearable life”, he emphasised that such exceptional situations require careful evaluation.\n“No anthropology regarding the human person equals that of the Church,” Cardinal Fernández told the conference.\nThe Argentine cardinal referenced the dicastery’s recent document Dignitas Infinita on human dignity, explaining the concept inspired by Pope John Paul II’s words in 1980 in Osnabrück, Germany.\n“God has shown us in an insurmountable way in Jesus Christ how much he loves each man and how immense is the dignity that he has conferred on him through him. Precisely those who must suffer from some physical or spiritual impediment must recognise themselves as friends of Jesus, as loved especially by him,” Cardinal Fernández said, quoting St John Paul II.\nThe conference, titled “The Catholic Foundation of Human Dignity,” aims to engage Catholic theology with other sciences and worldviews, KHKT Rector Fr Christoph Ohly told Vatican News.\n“With the topic of human dignity and human rights, we have a theme that concerns not just Christians but every human being,” Fr Ohly said.\nFULL STORY\nVatican doctrine chief warns against ‘claim to omnipotence’ of gender ideology (By AC Wimmer, CNA )",
