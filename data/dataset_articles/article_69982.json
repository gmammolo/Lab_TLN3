  "text": "North Dakota’s House rejected a resolution urging citizens to “acknowledge the Kingship of Jesus Christ,” a measure some lawmakers dismissed as a political trap.\nHad it passed, voters would have had the final say at the ballot box.\nHouse Concurrent Resolution 3020 would have recognized the “Kingship of Jesus Christ over all the world so that this great state may at last receive the great blessings of real liberty, well-ordered discipline, peace and harmony.”\n“I believe this is a ‘gotcha’ (resolution),” Rep. Austen Schauer, R-West Fargo, said on the House floor Tuesday. “If you are a believer and you have … committed your life to Jesus and you vote against this, the public says -- and your church says -- ‘What’s wrong with you? Aren’t you a believer? Don’t you believe in Jesus?’”\nPeople are also reading…\nSchauer said the resolution could be used against lawmakers in primary elections, allowing opponents of those who vote against the bill to say, “‘This guy doesn’t believe in Jesus.’”\n“Government forcing religion never works,” he said. “Look throughout entire history, you cannot force religion. Government protects religious freedoms, that’s what government does. That’s what this body does. That’s what the United States Constitution does, Mr. Speaker. Faith is of the heart, not a legislative bill and not a poster in the cafeteria at school. It’s of the heart.”\nThe American Civil Liberties Union said the resolution follows a trend over the past several weeks of legislating religion that, when looked at on the whole, “feels a lot like a Christian Nationalist agenda.”\n“Christian nationalism is a valid view people are free to hold, but to legislate it is incompatible with constitutional protections of religious freedom and equality under the law,” ACLU lobbyist Cody Schuler told the Tribune.\nOther opponents of the bill echoed Schauer’s comments, calling the bill unconstitutional and against the spirit of religious freedom the country and state were founded on.\nBismarck Pastor Sylvia Bull, who spoke in opposition to the resolution in committee, said it violated Article One of the North Dakota Constitution, which states “the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship without discrimination or preference shall be forever guaranteed in this state.”\n“This is not the way to honor Christ or to make disciples,” Bull said. “Jesus' invitation to discipleship is always that, invitational, never coercive or controlling.”\nSupporters of the resolution said it did not violate the Constitution and was “simply an acknowledgement that Christianity shaped our state and nation and must continue to be a guiding force for North Dakota.” They said it did not impose or force religion on the people of North Dakota, rather, it affirmed what most North Dakotans already believe.\n“Jesus Christ is king of kings, he is lord of lords, he is supreme chief of all chiefs, he is God above all gods and he is judge above all judges,” Rep. Lori VanWinkle, R-Minot, said during Tuesday's floor session. “He is all that regardless of the various faiths and popular opinions otherwise. Recognizing this truth is not proclaiming a religion.”\nShe said the resolution does not violate the Constitution because it does not specify a sect of Christianity that a person must adhere to.\n\"But there is a time coming soon that every knee will bow, every nation, tribe and tongue will confess that Christ is lord,” VanWinkle said.\nReps. Jared Hendrix, R-West Fargo, and Jeff Hoverson, R-Minot, both said the country and state were based on Christianity, which Hoverson said creates the “most free” countries in the world.\nHe claimed the founding fathers chose to base their worldview -- and the U.S. government -- on Christianity because they recognized “Christianity was the only religion and the only world view that gave freedom to everybody.”\n“There is no other religion that affords that kind of freedom,” Hoverson said. “Try living that way in a Muslim country. It’s not going to work out very well for you. So, an unbeliever, an atheist, a Muslim or any other religion, is most free in a nation where Christianity is its roots.”\nThe resolution received an 8-1 do-not-pass recommendation from the House Political Subdivisions Committee with four legislators absent/not voting and was shot down in the House by a vote of 59-31 with four legislators absent/not voting.",
