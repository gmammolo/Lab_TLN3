  "text": "The Catholic Church on Thursday expressed concerns over the potential expansion of Sharia law in Southwest Nigeria .\nThe church warned that such move is possible of heightening religious tensions and could lead to conflict in the region.\nThe Church also called for careful deliberation, emphasising the importance of upholding religious freedom and ensuring that no religious group is favoured over another in the region.\nThe issue was deliberately upon during the 5th Edition of the media parley with the Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria (CSN) Community, held in Abuja.\nThe event featured key Church leaders, including Rev. Fr. Lawrence Emehel, Director of the Mission and Dialogue Department, who addressed the discussions surrounding the introduction of Sharia law.\nHe acknowledged the constitutional allowances for Sharia law in personal matters but urged that it be implemented cautiously to avoid disenfranchising other religious groups.\nHe stressed that any legal reform must ensure inclusivity and respect for religious diversity in Southwest Nigeria.\nThe CSN official said: “The question at hand is the introduction of Sharia law in Southwest Nigeria, and the position of the Church must be clarified first and foremost. The current desire for Sharia law stems from dissatisfaction with the existing system.\n“The Church views this situation through the lens of understanding and trust. It is essential to recognise that Southwest Nigeria is a melting pot of diverse religious beliefs. Favouring one group over another could lead to conflict, especially in families with different religious traditions.\n“The Catholic Church in Nigeria calls for caution—not to dismiss the legitimate desires of the people, but to acknowledge that we do not exist in isolation. It is crucial that the implementation of these laws does not inhibit or restrict others in their practices. Our identity as Nigerians is paramount, and this must not be undermined. The constitution guarantees religious liberty, but careful consideration is necessary to prevent discrimination or exclusion”.\nAnother critical issue discussed at the event was the rise of neo-paganism among youths, which the Church views as a growing challenge.\nRev. Fr. Boniface Idoko, National Youth Animator, addressed the alarming trend of young Nigerians turning to pagan practices as a temporary escape from socio-economic difficulties.\nHe attributed this shift to a decline in family values and the overwhelming influence of social media.\nThe priest said: “Our youths are drawn to whatever seems to offer immediate relief or support, often leading them to pagan practices as a temporary escape from their challenges. The socio-economic environment undermines their mental stability, and old practices are resurfacing.\n“The decline in family values has left children influenced by the streets and social media. Without proper guidance, young people are easily swayed. The Church recognises its role as a nurturing force and is organising training sessions to redirect young minds towards true faith and worship. We aim to instil values against materialism and moral neglect, and to renew hope and understanding of faith. With God’s help, we hope to reclaim our youth”.\nConcerning reforms, Rev. Fr. Augustine Okochi, Director of the Pastoral Agents Department, spoke about necessity of the Church’s active participation in ongoing consultations with the government regarding educational reforms, particularly the proposed 12-4 education system.\nFr. Okochi reiterated the importance of ensuring that all stakeholders, including the Church, have a say in the shaping of educational policies that affect the future of Nigeria’s youth.\nHe said: “We recognise the importance of consulting all stakeholders before major decisions. Collaboration between the Church and government has historically been successful, and we hope to continue this partnership. We are engaged in consultations and monitoring the government’s actions in education”.",
