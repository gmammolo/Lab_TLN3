The Vatican said Francis’s respiratory infection also involves asthmatic bronchitis, which required the use of cortisone antibiotic treatment. “Laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and the Holy Father’s clinical condition continue to present a complex picture,” the Vatican said.\nJoin the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel\nStay up to date with all the latest news",
