  "text": "Wednesday 19 February 2025\nFractious Synod debate held on the diversity of the vacancy-in-see committee\nThe Bishop of London, the Rt Revd Sarah Mullally, presents the motion, on Friday\n“WOMEN’S voices continue not to be heard” in the Church of England because of institutional barriers, the Bishop of London, the Rt Revd Sarah Mullally, has said.\nDuring a fractious debate at the General Synod on Friday on proposed changes to make-up of the vacancy-in-see committee, she said that women “continue to experience micro-aggression”.\nEach diocese is required to have a vacancy-in-see committee, which meets only when the Bishop of that diocese has vacated the post, whether in the event of translation to another see, retirement, resignation, or death.\nThe committee holds at least two meetings, the first of which is held as soon as practicable after the vacancy has been announced. At its second meeting, the committee discusses the needs of the diocese before preparing a statement setting out those needs, which is sent to the Crown Nominations Commission (CNC), which is responsible for the appointment of the next Bishop. The committee elects by ballot from amongst its members persons to be members of the CNC.\nThe changes being put to the Synod last week were brought forward with reference to a review, published last year, of the appointment of the Rt Revd Philip North as Bishop of Blackburn (News, 19 April 2024). The reviewer, Maggie Swinson, had found that the process had been followed correctly, but recommended that the appropriateness of a suffragan bishop in the diocese chairing the vacancy-in-see committee be reviewed.\nIn accordance with this, one of the changes that Bishop Mullally proposed was to mandate that the chair be elected from among the lay members of the committee. This, she told the Synod, would avoid the risk of other members feeling unable to speak their mind because the chair was their line manager, or in another position of authority.\nOther proposals were aimed at ensuring “better representation of the diocese as a whole” on the eventual CNC, Bishop Mullally said. This included a requirement that at least one woman was chosen to be among the six diocesan representatives on the CNC, and that two members of the vacancy-in-see committee could not be connected with the same parish.\nDuring the debate, many spoke in support of the motion, including Nadine Daniel (Liverpool). She also, however, that her diocese “has a problem” with its CNC, and that this would not be addressed by the proposed changes.\n“That problem is that there is somebody who cannot be trusted to maintain their oath of confidentiality,” she said, referring to a recent leak about the appointment process of Dr John Perumbalath to the see of Liverpool (News, 7 February).\nSeveral amendments to the main motion were brought, including one from Jennifer Fellows (Gloucester) that sought to remove the requirement for at least one lay person and at least one cleric from those elected from a vacancy-in-see committee to the CNC to be female. While she wished to see female clergy better represented, and more in the top jobs, the proposed change failed to address issues of women not being listened to, she argued. “We can still enthusiastically pursue and empower women to become part of the process.”\nIn a key intervention, Bishop Mullally reminded the Synod that there had been no women on the vacancy-in-see committees in Durham, Exeter, and Coventry, and only one in Winchester, Sodor & Man, and Ely.\n“Women’s voices continue not to be heard,” she said in growing frustration. “Why are we not ensuring that our members are 50 per cent men and 50 per cent women? Even if we only have two possibilities, we still have four who are men.\n“There continue to be institutional barriers. We continue to experience micro-aggression,” Bishop Mullally said, before, visibly emotional, she turned away from the podium. This was met with prolonged applause and a standing ovation. “People will say I have manipulated you,” she continued. “I have not manipulated you. . . Reject this amendment.”\nThe Revd Kate Massey (Coventry), said: “Women are not another minority in the Church. We are a majority. We are subject to legal discrimination because of the bodies we inhabit. You need the voice of local women in your discernment. Every CNC includes a male priest, but not an ordained woman.”\nThe Revd Jo Winn-Smith (Guildford) said: “Here we are today debasing women. We are a majority in the Church’s congregations. I urge you to reject this.”\nThe Revd Kate Wharton (Liverpool) supported the amendment at one level: “I am a feminist and an egalitarian.” She was in favour of equal representation for men and women on all committees, but said: “We should be beyond a time of reserving places for one gender. I want this clause not to need to exist. I want us to be better about changing our culture.”\nTHE behaviour of the House of Bishops had made her “furious”, the Bishop-designate of Aston, Canon Esther Prior, told the General Synod on Thursday, in a condemnation of its lack of consultation over proposed changes to Standing Orders relating to the Crown Nominations Commission\nThe Archbishop of York also wished this conversation was not necessary. “I wish we didn’t need any of those things, but we do, for the greater cause of unity and representation, and everyone feeling they have a place around the table.”\nThe amendment was lost in a counted vote by Houses. Bishops 1-18, with two recorded abstentions; Clergy 55-79, with nine recorded abstentions; Laity 68-90, with four recorded abstentions.\nOther amendments lapsed as a consequence.\nReturning to the main motion, the Revd Dr Charlie Bell (Southwark) said: “Show the Bishop of London a little more respect than comparing what she’s trying to do with Mugabe or South Africa. There has been so much talk about paying attention to power. This is being a bit ludicrous — we are not listening to the voices of those who don’t believe they are being heard. Just vote the thing.”\nKenson Li (co-opted) was visibly impatient, too. He had been co-opted as one coming from a GMH background, he said. “Synod, if you think the system is working, don’t be surprised if they [young people] leave us. They will have made their minds up that this Church is not worth their time.”\nThe motion was carried in all three Houses. Bishops 16-3, with three recorded abstentions; Clergy 83-64, with four recorded abstentions; Laity 93-64, with no recorded abstentions.\nArchbishop Cottrell moved: ‘That the Vacancy in See Committees Regulation 2024 (Amendment) Regulation 2025, be solemnly affirmed and proclaimed in an Act of Synod.’\nBrowse Church and Charity jobs on the Church Times jobsite\nChine McDonald charts a backlash against the anti-racism cause\n13 January - 19 May 2025\nAn online evening lecture series, run jointly by Sarum College and The Church Times\ntickets available\n28 February - 2 March 2025\nTo explore the Church Times website fully, please sign in or subscribe.\nNon-subscribers can read four articles for free each month.
