  "text": "Ezekiel Odero Says Pastor Ng'ang'a Instructed Him to Close His Church for 3 Days: \"Nilifunga\"\n- Kilifi-based televangelist Pastor Ezekiel Odero expressed deep admiration for Pastor James Ng’ang’a\n- Pastor Ezekiel revealed that Pastor Ng’ang’a once ordered him to close his church for three days and he obeyed\n- The preacher said he respects the Neno Evangelism founder as a father figure due to his blunt nature\nDon't miss out! Join\nTuko.co.ke Sports News channel on WhatsApp now!\nRenowned preacher\nPastor Ezekiel Odero of Newlife Prayer Center and Church has openly expressed his admiration and deep respect for fellow preacher Pastor James Ng’ang’a of Neno Evangelism Centre.\nSpeaking during a sermon at his church,\nPastor Ezekiel shared how much he values Pastor Ng’ang’a’s straightforward and sometimes blunt way of communicating with him.\nAccording to him, Pastor Ng’ang’a’s tough love and authoritative stance make him feel guided and appreciated, similar to how a father would treat his son.\nWhy Pastor Ezekiel holds Ng’ang’a in high Regard\nThe preacher recalled an instance where Pastor Ng’ang’a instructed him to close his church for three days and take a break from preaching—a command he followed without hesitation.\n\"He is the only one that talks to me the way he feels. He will never judge his words before he speaks to me. That is why I love him. He treats me exactly as a father would treat his son,\" Pastor Ezekiel revealed.\nHe went on to explain how Pastor Ng’ang’a not only advised him to rest but also extended an invitation for a special meal once he returned from his trip abroad.\n\"Apostle Ng’ang’a is the only one who gave me a phone call and told me to close my church for three days. He told me to rest for three days as he was going to America. He also invited me to his place for goat meat upon his return to Kenya, and I closed the church for three days. I love him for that; he can talk to me the way he wants,\" he said.\nPastor Ezekiel’s sentiments highlight the rare bond he shares with Pastor Ng’ang’a. While many perceive Ng’ang’a as a no-nonsense preacher known for his harsh tone and controversial remarks, Ezekiel sees him as a father figure whose stern approach stems from a place of genuine concern and mentorship.\nPastor Ng’ang’a has been in ministry for decades and is known for his dramatic style of preaching, commanding presence, and bold confrontations with critics.\nDespite his often controversial nature, he has remained influential in Kenya’s religious space.\nPastor Ezekiel, on the other hand, is widely known for his soft-spoken nature, massive crusades, and dedicated prayer services that attract thousands of believers. Despite their contrasting styles, the two have developed a mutual understanding and respect.\nSource: TUKO.co.ke\nBrian Ajon (Entertainment Editor) Brian Ajon is a journalist accredited by The Media Council of Kenya with close to three years of experience in print and digital media.
