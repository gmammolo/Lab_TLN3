  "text": "Founder and leader of Heaven’s Gate Ministries, Prophet Kumchacha\nFounder and leader of Heaven’s Gate Ministries, Nicholas Osei, popularly known as Prophet Kumchacha, has expressed his thoughts about marriage and the challenges it comes with.\nIn an interview with Zionfelix on February 19, 2025, Kumchacha noted that marriage does not have any significant value since it involves a lot of problems if couples are not compatible.\nHe went on to assert that if Jesus Christ had married, he might have missed heaven due to the temptation marriage brings, which could have led him to act contrary to his teachings.\n“If marriage were an easy thing, Jesus Christ would have gotten married himself. If Jesus had gotten married, he might as well have missed heaven, especially if he had married a bad woman. Prominent people are crying behind closed doors because of marriage.”\n“Marriage comes with a lot of drama, and if we were to come back to life again, I would plead with God to make marriage a contract so people can renew it when they are happy with it. If marriage wasn’t created by God, I would have said it is useless,” he said.\nProphet Kumchacha also noted that a lot of married people are going through depression and other forms of abuse due to settling down with the wrong partner.\n“A lot of people have died because of marriage. Because of marriage, people are going through depression and a whole lot of abuse. I see marriage as a poison. If we were to come back to life after death, I would plead with God to stop marriage itself,” he added.\nWatch the video below:\nMeanwhile, watch as Joseph Yammin warns NDC MPs over apologizing for Ken Ofori-Atta’s house raid\nJHM/EB",
