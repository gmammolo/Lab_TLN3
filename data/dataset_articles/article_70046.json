  "text": "- By Kamakshi Bishnoi\n- Published: Wed, 19 Feb 2025 06:11 PM (IST)\n- Source:JND\nMaha Kumbh 2025: Reacting to the ongoing uproar over West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s controversial remark about the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati, the 46th Shankaracharya of the Jyotish Peeth in Uttarakhandhas extended his support to CM Banerjee and slammed the UP government over alleged mismanagement during the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj.\n“False propaganda was spread, the talk of 144 years itself is a lie. Crowd management and hospitality principles were not followed. Even when people died, they tried to hide it, which was a grave crime. In such a situation, if someone calls it names, then we won't be able to oppose it,\" Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati said referring to Mamata Banerjee’s remarks.\nWATCH: Swami Video\n— ANI (@ANI)\n[#WATCH]| Bemetara, Chhattisgarh: On West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's 'Mrityu Kumbh' remark, Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati Maharaj says, \"...

If this is not mismanagement, then what is it? People had to walk 25-30 km with their luggage. The water coming for bathing is mixed with sewage water and the scientists don't consider it fit for bathing, yet you are forcing crores of people to bathe in it.\"\nREAD MORE: CM Adityanath Chides Mamata Banerjee Over 'Mrityu Kumbh' Remark, Calls Out Oppn's Criticism Of Mahakumbh\n\"Your job was to either stop the drains for a few days or divert them so that people could get pure water while bathing... You knew 12 years ago that the Maha Kumbh would come after 12 years, why did you not make any effort in this regard?\" he said, as quoted by news agency ANI.\nMamata Banerjee on Tuesday, accused the Uttar Pradesh government of mishandling the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, alleging that the biggest religious event has turned into \"Mrityu Kumbh.\" Banarjee’s statement addressed the Prayagraj Stampede that took place during the ongoing Mahakumbh 2025, in which at least 30 got killed while several others sustained injuries.\n“Maha Kumbh has turned into ‘Mrityu Kumbh’. I respect Maha Kumbh, and I respect the holy Ganga Maa. But there is no planning. How many people have been rescued? For the rich and VIPs, there are systems in place to get camps (tents) for as much as Rs 1 lakh. But for the poor, there are no arrangements at Kumbh,\" the Chief Minister said while addressing the Budget Session of the West Bengal Assembly.\nIn response to Banerjee’s statement on Tuesday, the BJP legislators have referred to her as a ‘Hindu virodhi mukhyamantri’ (anti-Hindu chief minister). They stated that the purported insult to the Maha Kumbh would not be condoned by the Indian people.\nREAD MORE: Woman Breaks Internet With Her Shocking Discovery At Mahakumbh Mela | Video Goes Viral",
