  "text": "4 Min Read\nUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday, February 19, criticised opposition parties for their statements on the Maha Kumbh, accusing them of spreading misinformation and attempting to undermine the significance of the religious event.\nSpeaking in the state assembly during the Budget Session, he asserted that any attempt to “malign” the Maha Kumbh or show disrespect toward Sanatan Dharma would not be tolerated.\nOpposition misleading people, says Adityanath\nThe Chief Minister described the Maha Kumbh as a symbol of India's cultural and spiritual heritage, emphasising that it was not just a religious gathering but a global event of great significance. He accused opposition parties of engaging in \"false propaganda\" to mislead people and create confusion.\n“Sanatan Dharma is the soul of India, and it is our duty to uphold its dignity. The opposition’s attempts to malign the Maha Kumbh with false narratives will not be tolerated,” Adityanath said.\nHe accused parties like the\nOpposition raises concerns over event management\n“No one is against the Maha Kumbh, but the government invited people, claiming to have made arrangements for 100 crore devotees. How did the stampede happen? How did the traffic jam occur? People were stuck in vehicles for hours. Devotees died in road accidents. This shows the complete mismanagement of the event,” Yadav said.\nAdityanath dismissed these concerns, stating that the opposition had been against the Maha Kumbh from the outset and had spread \"baseless rumours\" about its organisation and funding. He said social media posts by opposition leaders reflected their mindset, and their language was unacceptable in a civilised society.\nOpposition leaders criticised for remarks\nThe Chief Minister singled out various opposition figures for their comments on the Maha Kumbh, including\n“These irresponsible statements from leaders of the Samajwadi Party, Congress, RJD, and TMC are a direct insult to Sanatan Dharma’s biggest event,” he added.\nDefending the Maha Kumbh’s legacy\nAdityanath stressed that the Maha Kumbh was deeply rooted in Vedic scriptures such as the Rigveda, Atharvaveda, and Shrimad Bhagwat Purana, and viewing it through a political lens was inappropriate.\nHe also claimed that opposition leaders who had initially criticised the event had later participated in it. “A sick person could be treated, but a sick mindset could not be,” he remarked. He recalled that in 2013, under the Samajwadi Party’s rule, even their own leaders were restricted from visiting Prayagraj, but this time, they had attended and praised the arrangements.\nOpposition’s stance on Ram Temple questioned\nExtending his attack to opposition leaders’ stance on the\nHe further asserted that Uttar Pradesh had undergone a transformation since the BJP took office in 2017, shedding its negative image.\n“Today, UP is known for development, law and order, and cultural preservation.
