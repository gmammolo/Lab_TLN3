  "text": "New Delhi [India], February 19 (ANI): All India Imam Association Chairman Sajid Rashidi has urged parties to not politicise the Telangana government's decision to allow Muslim employees to leave at 4 PM during Ramzan .\nSpeaking to ANI, Rashidi stated that if the government is giving one-hour relief to Muslims during Ramzan , then there shouldn't be any politics on it. He stated that it is the duty of every Indian to respect religious ideas of every religion.\nSajid Rashidi said, \"There is no doubt that Ramadan is a holy festival, and it is the duty of every Indian to respect the faith of another religion. If the government is giving one hour on such occasions, then there should be no politics on this. Any community should get this exemption on any festival, whether it is the Hindu community, the Sikh community, or the Christian community.\"\nRashidi stated that the misfortune of the nation is the politics that is being done on the name of religion. He added that none of the political parties are focusing on unemployment and inflation and are busy in doing appeasement politics.\n\"The misfortune of our country is that whatever politics we do, we do it in the name of religion, whether it is Ram Mandir, Triple Talaq, 370 or Uniform Civil Code, all this politics is being done in the name of religion. No one is paying attention to how much inflation is there, how much unemployment there is. All this is appeasement politics\", he added.\nOn Tuesday, the Telangana government allowed the government Muslim employees to leave at 4 PM during Ramzan . These included teachers, contract, out-sourcing, boards, corporations and Public Sector employees working in the State to leave their Offices/Schools at 4.00 p.m. during the Holy Month of Ramzan that is from March 2 to March 31.
