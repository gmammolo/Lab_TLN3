  "text": "DNA test results seemingly refute a woman's claims that a statue of the Virgin Mary 'cried blood'.\nBack in 2016, Gisella Cardia purchased a statue of the Catholic figure at a\nreligious site in Medjugorje, Bosnia, and took it home with her to Trevignano Romano, Italy.\nCardia went on to make a serious of claims about the statue, including that it 'cried blood' and conveyed messages to her in an apparent miracle.\nAdvert\nWith its supposed supernatural powers in mind, people flocked to visit the effigy, with Cardia going on to receive thousands in donations.\nBut Cardia faced accusations of fraud by prosecutors in Civitavecchia in 2023 after it was alleged that the blood on the statue was actually\npig's blood.\nAs part of the investigation, DNA swabs were taken form the Virgin Mary figure and the results have recently been revealed.\nAdvert\nThe first set of results confirmed that the blood was that of a human woman, and now further details have emerged.\nAs per Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, laboratory tests have found traces of Cardia's DNA in the blood that was on statue.\nBut her lawyer has argued that doesn't necessarily mean that the whole thing was a sham and that it all comes to down whether the DNA is single-profile or mixed.\nWith this in mind, she's called for further investigations.\nAdvert\nSolange Marchignoli said: \"From a\nscientific point of view, the DNA stain deserves further investigation.\n\"We are waiting to know if it is a mixed or single profile: if the profile is single, it means that it is only Cardia's and she put it there, so in this case we would go to trial, but if, as expected, the profile is mixed, it means that the DNA found on the statue also contains Gisella's DNA, which we expect because she used the statuette, kissed it and handled it.\"\nMarchignoli went on to argue that her client 'is moved by a deep faith and has nothing to gain from this', adding that Cardi is 'not crazy'.\nAdvert\nThe DNA results come after the the Diocese of Civita Castellana conducted its own investigation into the matter and ruled that the events in question were 'non-supernatural'.\nIn a statement issued in May 2024, the religious organization said on behalf of the bishop of Civita Castellana, Marco Salvi: \"After an appropriate period of careful discernment, having listened to the testimonies coming from the [diocesan] territory and making use of a commission of experts, made up of a Mariologist, a theologian, a canonist, a psychologist, and with the outside advice of some specialists, having considered the figure of Mary in the Tradition of the Church and in the living faith of the people of God, after fervent prayer, decrees the events in question to be non-supernatural.\"\nTopics:\nReligion, News, World News",
