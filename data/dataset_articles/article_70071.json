  "text": "France's right-dominated Senate has backed a bill to ban religious symbols including the Muslim headscarf in all sport competitions, professional and amateur, sparking accusations of discrimination from the left and rights advocates.\nThe bill still needs a majority of votes from the lower-house National Assembly to become law, but the right-leaning government has thrown its weight behind the measure.\nCritics see the headscarf worn by some Muslim women as a symbol of creeping Islamisation after deadly jihadist attacks in France, while others say they are just practising their religion and should wear what they want.\nUnder France's brand of secularism, civil servants, teachers and pupils cannot wear any obvious religious symbols such as a Christian cross, Jewish kippa, Sikh turban or Muslim headscarf, also known as a hijab.\nWhile such a sweeping ban does not yet exist across all sports in France, several federations have already prohibited religious clothing including in football and basketball.\nThe upper-house Senate on Tuesday evening voted 210 to 81 to ban \"the wearing of any sign or outfit ostensibly showing a political or religious affiliation\" in competitions at regional and national level organised by all the country's sports federations.\nThe draft law also bans outfits that might \"contravene\" principles of French secularism in France's swimming pools.",
