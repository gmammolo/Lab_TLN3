  "text": "Czech Bishops' Conference Condemns Eucharist in Pub\nRev. Marek Vácha, chaplain of the University of Prague, celebrated the Eucharist on January 29 in a bar in Břevnov, Czech Republic. There were half-filled wine and beer glasses on the tables.\nThe celebration was called \"The Lord in the Tavern.\nAn advertisement shared on social media announced a \"pub party for believers and non-believers.\" It added that a waitress would be at the bar: \"It will be possible to drink beer or other liquids throughout the evening.\"\nThe Bishops' Conference of the Czech Republic called the event \"unlawful and inappropriate.\nIn a Feb. 3 statement, the bishops point out that the Eucharist \"must be celebrated in a sacred place, unless in exceptional cases necessity requires otherwise.\" \"The celebration of Holy Mass in a bar without serious reason is in itself inappropriate.\"\nAnd: \"In no case should the celebration of Holy Mass be combined with the context of an ordinary dinner.\nWhile the organizers argued that the purpose of the event was \"to bring closer to the Lord those who would not otherwise come to church,\" the bishops' statement asks \"why we bring the Eucharist to the bar for those who do not come to church.\"\nAs a result, Father Marek Vácha, who belongs to the Brno diocese, was dismissed by the Prague archdiocese from his post as chaplain of the university community.\nHowever, Bishop Pavel Konzbul of Brno will not punish the priest who \"apologized\".\nThe celebration was called \"The Lord in the Tavern.\nAn advertisement shared on social media announced a \"pub party for believers and non-believers.\" It added that a waitress would be at the bar: \"It will be possible to drink beer or other liquids throughout the evening.\"\nThe Bishops' Conference of the Czech Republic called the event \"unlawful and inappropriate.\nIn a Feb. 3 statement, the bishops point out that the Eucharist \"must be celebrated in a sacred place, unless in exceptional cases necessity requires otherwise.\" \"The celebration of Holy Mass in a bar without serious reason is in itself inappropriate.\"\nAnd: \"In no case should the celebration of Holy Mass be combined with the context of an ordinary dinner.\nWhile the organizers argued that the purpose of the event was \"to bring closer to the Lord those who would not otherwise come to church,\" the bishops' statement asks \"why we bring the Eucharist to the bar for those who do not come to church.\"\nAs a result, Father Marek Vácha, who belongs to the Brno diocese, was dismissed by the Prague archdiocese from his post as chaplain of the university community.\nHowever, Bishop Pavel Konzbul of Brno will not punish the priest who \"apologized\".",
