  "text": "2/19/2025 Indonesia (International Christian Concern) — On the morning of Feb. 4, Christians living in Paccerakkang, Biringkanaha, Makassar, Indonesia, saw a banner telling them they were not welcome in the community.\nThe banner read, “We, all Muslims, residents of Paccerakkang, especially Neighbourhood 02 and 03 STRONGLY REJECT the Establishment of a Church and worship activities in our environment forever.”\nAn unknown person installed the ban n er in front of the Polda Housing Complex, Mangga 3, targeting the worship activities of the Toraja Church of the Lanraki Congregation. Residents removed the banner early that afternoon.\nThe content of the banner is seen as hate speech, and Christians in the community fear it could lead to increased hostility toward their community.\nAs a constitutional state, it must protect its citizens’ religious and worship rights. Article 29, paragraph (2) of the 1945 Constitution reads, “The state guarantees the freedom of each citizen to practice their respective religions and to worship according to their religion and beliefs.”\nThe banner also contains discriminatory content against the church. Of course, this rejection degrades the dignity of certain religious groups. This contradicts Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which emphasizes, “Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.”\nThe state fully guarantees the freedom to establish a church and conduct worship activities in it, individually or together. Indonesia has ratified international human rights instruments regarding the protection of the right to freedom of expression and religion.\nTherefore, every government instrument related to the banner, from Neighborhood to FKUB Makassar City, needs to take protective measures against church congregations and encourage persuasive actions that mediate religious conflicts as a form of prevention against discrimination and hostility between religious communities.\nTo read more news stories, visit the ICC Newsroom .
