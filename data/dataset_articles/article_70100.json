  "text": "Refusal to sell same-sex wedding cake violates state law, California court rules\nFebruary 19, 2025\n» Continue to this story on Religion Clause\nCWN Editor's Note: Overturning a lower court ruling, a California state appellate court has ruled that Cathy Miller, a Christian who runs Cathy’s Creations and Tastries in Bakersfield, violated state anti-discrimination law when she declined to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding.\nMiller said she will “not design cakes that celebrate divorce, display violence, glorify drunkenness or drug use, contain explicit sexual content, or present gory, demonic, or satanic images”—or “cakes that demean any person or group for any reason, or that promote racism, or any other message that conflicts with Christian principles.”\nAbout CWN news coverage.\nFor all current news, visit our News home page.\nAll comments are moderated.
