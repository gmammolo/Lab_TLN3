  "text": "MIRPUR, Feb 19 (APP):Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Minister for Information Maulana Pir Muhammad Mazhar Saeed Shah Wednesday strongly condemned the confiscation of Islamic and history books and property of Kashmiris by the occupying Indian forces in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) state. He said, in a statement, the nefarious attempt by Indian extremists to erase the history and culture of Kashmir will not succeed. The Minister stated that after the unconstitutional, illegal and sinister action of 5th August 2019, India was continuously exercising such heinous acts targeting Kashmiri Muslims in IIOJK He expressed that under the agenda of the Indian extremist ruling RSS, India is imposing a Hindutva-based curriculum in schools to erase the identity of Muslims, change their history, and mislead the new generation of Jammu and Kashmir. Maulana Shah appealed to global human rights organizations and institutions to take notice of this brutality and extremism of India. The Kashmiri leader further added that India was the mastermind of terrorism in this region, the peace of the entire region was at stake due to the continual nefarious tactics of India in IIOJK targeting innocent Kashmiris.",
