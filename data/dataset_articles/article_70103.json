  "text": "By Stefan J. Bos, Chief International Correspondent Worthy News\nJAKARTA ( Worthy News ) – Devoted Christians in an area of Indonesia’s South Sulawesi Province said Thursday they fear for their future after hardline local Muslims objected to their worship activities and construction of a church.\nChristians explained that the Toraja Christian Church of Lanraki (TCCL) in Paccerakkang village had gathered in a member’s home for two years.\nYet in May, the TCCL asked local authorities for permission to build a church to accommodate the growing number of church members, said the head of its construction committee, Makis Wata\nIn published remarks, Makis recalled being upset about a February 4 banner displayed in the nearby Makasar local police housing complex stating, “We, all Muslims in Paccerakkang, especially residents of RW 02 RT 02 and RT 03, strongly reject the construction of a church and religious activities in our area forever.”\nPastor Nicky Wakkary of the Pentecostal Church in Indonesia (Gereja Protestan di Indonesia, GPdI), who was banned from holding a Christmas service last year at his house in Cibinong, West Java Province, appealed to the Lanraki congregation to remain faithful.\n“The congregation must remain steadfast in their faith and support each other so that they remain steadfast,” despite the difficulties Pastor Nicky said. “At the same time, the congregation must learn more about the community social life around the place, which enables them to build a better relationship with the government and the community.”\nChristians said residents removed the banner early that afternoon, but the future remained uncertain. “The content of the banner is seen as hate speech, and Christians in the community fear it could lead to increased hostility toward their community,” added advocacy group International Christian Concern (ICC), which supports the believers.\n‘DISCRIMINATORY CONTENT’\n“The banner also contains discriminatory content against the church” and “degrades” minority groups such as Christians, the group stressed. “This contradicts Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which emphasizes, “Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.”\nICC added that “Indonesia has ratified international human rights instruments regarding the protection of the right to freedom of expression and religion” and urged local authorities to protect the Christians.\nChristians told Worthy News that the incident comes amid mounting concern about Islamic opposition toward churches involved in evangelism in Indonesia.\nDespite the difficulties, Christianity continues to spread in Indonesia, a mainly Muslim nation of 282 million people. And on Thursday, a massive prayer meeting occurred in the Medan area, Worthy News learned.\nThose identifying as “Christian” comprise roughly 11 percent of the population, including three percent evangelicals, according to researchers.\nYet a leader of a Christian movement of former Muslims and other Christian leaders suggested to Worthy News the actual figure may be higher as not everyone admits to having abandoned Islam.\nICC said it hopes Indonesia will continue to respect its constitution, which states that ” the state guarantees the freedom of each citizen to practice their respective religions and to worship according to their religion and beliefs.”",
