  "text": "WORLD\nBad weather forces multiple Uzbekistan-bound aircraft to alternate airports\nSeveral flights bound for cities across Uzbekistan were forced to divert to alternate airports on January 8 due to adverse weather conditions at their destinations. In total, seven aircraft changed course after meteorological conditions made landings unsafe.\nUzbekistan Airports told Uzbek media that flights operated by different carriers were affected. Aircraft heading to Karshi from Medina with Fly Khiva and from Moscow with Ural Airlines, as well as a Centrum Air service from Jeddah to Bukhara, were all rerouted to Samarkand Airport.\nTwo additional flights — an Uzbekistan Airways service from Kazan to Fergana and a Fly One flight from Jeddah to Fergana — were diverted to Tashkent as their alternate landing point.\nFurther diversions were also carried out by Uzbekistan Airways. A flight from Moscow to Karshi was redirected to Samarkand, while another of the airline’s aircraft operating the Tashkent–Urgench route was forced to land in Nukus due to poor weather conditions in Urgench.\nSimilar disruptions had been reported the previous day. Several flights arriving from Moscow were sent to alternate airfields after unfavourable weather affected multiple regions.\nBy Tamilla Hasanova",
