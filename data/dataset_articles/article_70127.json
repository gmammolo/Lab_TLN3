  "text": "Photography & Begging Banned in Mosques During Ramadan\nThe bans are part of a set of guidelines issued by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs.\nThe Ministry of Islamic Affairs issued a statement providing a set of guidelines for mosques to adhere to this upcoming Ramadan.\nThe ministry stressed that all mosque employees should try to be present during the holy month unless there is an emergency, and the need to install security cameras within the mosques. Cameras or photography for visitors are disallowed.\nBegging will not be allowed both in or around any mosques, and employees are encouraged to call security upon anyone who does so. People are instead encouraged to donate zakat or charity.\nEmployees who distribute out the food and break their fast at the mosque – which is designated to be eaten at every mosque’s courtyard – will be responsible for cleaning up “immediately after Iftar,” the Ministry of Islamic Affairs said.\nThe ministry stressed the importance of adhering to these guidelines as the Kingdom expects an “intensification of field visits by mosque inspectors to follow up on the implementation of all instructions issued to its employees.”",
