This was stated by the international lawyer of the Canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) Robert Amsterdam in an interview with journalist Tucker Carlson, which was posted on the journalist's Facebook page.\n\"The US State Department participated in the creation of the church. I believe that either USAID or some other organizations funded this state church called the OCU,\" the lawyer emphasized.",
