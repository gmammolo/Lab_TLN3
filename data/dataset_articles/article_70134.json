  "text": "Phayao abbot leaves monkhood after photos with partner emerge\nA well-known abbot and subdistrict head monk in Mueang district, Phayao province, has left the monkhood following the circulation of photos showing him dining with his male partner.\nThe incident, which took place in Phetchabun province, led to significant public attention. Yesterday morning, February 19, the abbot completed the formal process of leaving the monkhood and departed from the temple, with no information available on his subsequent whereabouts.\nAs news spread, many locals gathered at the temple to check on the temple’s belongings, since the abbot was the only monk residing there. It was confirmed that he did not take any possessions with him, reported KhaoSod.\nResidents expressed regret over the abbot’s departure, as he had significantly contributed to the temple’s development during his tenure.\nThe incident is believed to have been a momentary lapse in judgment, which resulted in these events.\nLast year, police in Surat Thani apprehended a monk, acting as an abbot of a renowned temple, for indecent acts against six young boys. During their search, they discovered sex enhancement drugs in his room. The monk confessed before being charged with multiple offences.\nAt 12.30am on November 20 last year, Police Colonel Paisan Sangthep, Deputy Commander of Surat Thani Provincial Police, alongside Police Colonel Pornnarong Kanorachai and a team from Phrasaeng Police Station, arrested 44 year old Chaturaphat. He was the head of a temple in Phrasaeng district, Surat Thani.\nCommunity leaders had previously alerted the police about his inappropriate behaviour towards young novice monks and boys aged between 11 and 13, revealed Pol. Col. Pornnarong.\n“On the evening of November 19 last year, community leaders informed us of Chaturaphat’s improper sexual conduct. We immediately dispatched officers alongside community leaders to investigate the claims.”\nUpon investigation, Chaturaphat confessed to having engaged in indecent acts with the young boys from April to October last year.\nLatest Thailand News\nThailand News",
