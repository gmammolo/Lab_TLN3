  "text": "A pastor confesses that he can’t figure out how to make groups work. A popular author grabs a confession and says “See, small groups don’t work. You need to do it my way instead.” Another labels groups as a fad of the last decade. Another leader claims that small groups are small enough to care but not large enough to do anything. Then one of the most prominent churches that promoted small groups and developed an extensive network of churches for small group training is no longer doing groups. It seems like many people are jumping into the blog world to announce that their experience reveals why church small groups don’t work in America. They proclaim the demise of groups as if their point of view is the gospel truth. And the sad thing is that we embrace their limited point of view on small groups don’t work as if it is as valid as any other. Welcome to the post-modern world of flat information dissemination. Everyone is an expert. Or so it seems.\nBut we need to have something that helps us discern the elements of truth that these small group obituaries contain and try to understand why church small groups don’t work in these specific situations.\nWhy Church Small Groups Don’t Work The truth is that groups don’t often work in America. But that does not mean that they can’t work. We have to do the hard work of trying to figure out why church small groups don’t work. Please understand that reasons I will state are not so much about strategies as much as they are about how we approach our strategies. Here’s the first:\nReason #1 that Groups Don’t Work: Fad Hopping\nThe leadership of the church moves on to other emphases. When groups were the hot fad and big churches were promoting them and writing new books on why we should develop groups, it was easy to embrace them as central to church life. But when the excitement wanes, leadership moves on to something else that claims to be able to turn a church around. I recently learned that one of the flagship small group churches in North America, one that hosted annual conference on groups and even started an organization to help other churches develop groups, no longer emphasize home cell groups.\nRELATED: Ways to Guarantee Your Small Group Will Fail\nI have seen many churches in America fail at groups because they saw them as a fad and then moved on to other things that promised greater results. Sadly, in the 1990s and early 2000s, many were promoting groups as the best way to grow the church, including yours truly. And many jumped on this bandwagon because they thought that they could enter into the land of success. And when that did not pan out like they expected, they jumped on the next one that passed by.\nGroups work! And they can be done, even in America, in a way that brings growth. But they work and grow because we invest in them over the long haul. They are not a magic formula for church growth and health. They are not a fad. Far from it. For the last 50-60 years, the American church has seen about four or five waves of interest in groups.\nReason #2: Boredom with the Mundane Church leaders are not usually that good at embracing the mundane. We want results and we want them yesterday. We want something that makes for good testimonies, something that has what they call “sizzle” in the marketing world. After all we are accustomed to building churches on sizzle. In the old days, we had revival meetings, then meetings, and sing-alongs. Then we created seeker-services with all the excellence we could muster. Now we have multi-site with annual growth numbers that are staggering.\nLong-term small group success lacks this sizzle that we so eagerly long for. It has little fan fare. Small groups work when leaders operate like shepherds. They do the under-ground, consistent, steady work of caring for the sheep. That is hard to promote and measure. It’s different from developing programs in the church which can be seen and measured as we build buildings, develop budget-dependent programs and attract more and more people to a centralized venue. Small group ministry happens without such clear sizzle.\nSuch long term success cannot be promoted, inspired or programmed. It’s a little like my farm experience as a kid. My father did not go out and inspire the cattle, sheep, chickens, rabbits, etc. to eat, grow, have babies, and do what they were supposed to do. He did not promote, strategize, develop mission statements, motivate, etc. He did not do all the things that we are told that we must do to be good leaders in the church.\nInstead he was an environment creator. He focused his work the factors that contributed to a setting where the animals could naturally flourish. And to be honest, it is boring, mundane, repetitive, inconvenient, sacrificial, long, hard work. There are no short cuts to environment creation and maintenance. But when farmers do create the right environments, the animals do what they are supposed to do.\nThe reason why small groups flourish is when there are leaders who know how to do the mundane work of establishing and supporting environments for growth. May the Lord teach us what this looks like.\nLearn two more reasons why church small groups don’t work on Page Two Reason #3: Hiring Program Administrators We hire program administrators to run the small group ministry instead of hiring shepherds who will do the mundane, repetitive work of caring for sheep. The reason why small groups can work is an effective small group pastors possess strengths that allow them to focus their energies on caring for people, developing leaders and gathering people around a vision.\nI’m not sure that this is something that comes that easily for those of us who have been in church leadership for any length of time. Our traditional church structures have depended upon those who are good orators and those who are good program administrators. It does not take long to see this when we assess the average M.Div. program. And look at the most popular books that target pastors. The bestsellers speak to the issue of vision development skills, leadership aptitude and communication skills.\nI hope that I am wrong, but my observations on why small groups don’t work have caused me to conclude that we under-value those who are gifted as shepherds, those who take joy in coming alongside groups, mentoring leaders and dealing with difficult pastoral situations. Instead we hire program administrators who know how to track growth, run budgets, organize curriculum, manage the small group calendar and read reports. They know how to run the small group program but they don’t have the strength set that focuses on investing in group life, developing new leaders, sharing life with multiple groups in an area, dealing with group conflict and eating meals with people under their care.\nReason #4: Design Flaws Design principles guide the work of architects so they can build sound structures. Architects and structural engineers don’t copy the work of others verbatim. Every building is unique, depending upon many factors including the terrain upon which it is built. If the architect is not equipped in sound design principles, then he will be forced to copy and thereby build something that might not fit the situation at hand.\nIf we apply this analogy to a small group structure, then we need to identify a few things in very clear terms:\nFirst we need clear small group design principles. There are many good books and blog sites that are available to equip us all in designing good small group structures.\nSecond, we need architects who are able to apply these design principles to local contexts. In other words, an architect is not one who develops a structure that looks like what is written about in other books. An architect is one who designs a structure that fits the needs of the environment.\nThird, we need builders who can build the structure that has been designed. Most architects are not good builders and most builders are not adept at the creative thinking required to apply sound design principles to specific situations.\nFourth, we need maintainers who can keep the small group system working right. This is where the role of the pastoral shepherds comes into play. See this post .\nThe problem regarding why church small groups don’t work has been three-fold. First, most churches don’t think about the need for these roles when developing or growing groups. Therefore depending upon the personalities and strengths of the people involved (either staff or volunteer) they will focus on one of the roles. Usually, I find that churches will focus on the role of the “builder.”\nThe second problem related to why church small groups don’t work is that most churches cannot afford to address all of these needs.\nProblem number three is that there are fewer people who are wired with the strengths to play the role of small group architect or designer. I’ve had to learn this the hard way. I have tried to force myself into the role of a maintainer and a builder because that’s the role I assumed I needed to play. I’ve done both for a while, but I was never that good at it. Now I see that I am an architect, a creative designer who applies small design principles to specific situations. Honestly, I rarely find many who are wired with these propensities. And when I do find someone like this, they are in very large churches and they work with people who are builders and maintainers.\nMost often, a leader who is a builder or a maintainer will buy a few books on small groups and then do the work of building or maintaining groups. This is true because we always do a job or a role in a way that fits our strengths or tendencies. A builder builds and a maintainer maintains, even if the situation calls for something else.\nAs a result, the group system that a church develops might very well have design flaws, even if they follow the instructions laid out in various books. Most of the time, churches need architects to come alongside the builders and maintainers in a local context and to help them apply the design principles in a way that fits the local situation thereby eliminating these design flaws as much as possible.\nIn most cases, an small group designer is only needed for a short time. Sometimes, he or she plays the role of a consultant. Sometimes a trainer. Sometimes that of a coach who walks alongside for a year or two. Good architects in the construction world are expensive, but you don’t want to skimp on the design. You will always pay more for fixing the flaws than you would if you had a good plan up front. The same it true for small group designs. You can go the cheap route and buy a book and start building. But you will most likely end up paying the price down the road, usually in the form of people getting hurt.\nRELATED: Small Group Innovation\nOnce you understand why church small groups don’t work, find a good small group designer and get the help you need to establish a good design for your church. You want someone who is able to help you develop something local, something that fits your situation. You don’t want to just have someone come in and layout a universal plan that they give to everyone. Also note that different designers specialize in different things. Do your homework and find one that can provide the kind of design that you need.\nThis article on why church small groups don’t work originally appeared here , and is used by permission.",
