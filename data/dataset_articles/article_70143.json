  "text": "WHAT GOD DOES TO THOSE WHO DON’T WANT TO KNOW HIM\nMany simply do not care about knowing God and, therefore, are given to perverse feelings. But if your desire is sincere to know God and do His will, know that He rejoices in satisfying all those who carry this thirst within.\nThe word of God speaks of a group of people in this world who have no desire, interest, or curiosity about knowing God.\nIt is as if they are completely empty of the presence of God. Human beings place within themselves the concept that they themselves are God, that they are their own masters. They have such great a God complex that when someone asks if they believe in God, they soon pass judgment on God: “No, I don’t believe that God exists because if He exists, how can there be so many bad things in the world, etc.” That is, they sit in the chair of God’s judgement.\nThe Word says that these people are given to perverse feelings and to do things that are not appropriate.\n“And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting.” Romans 1:28\nSo, when the person is not accountable to anyone, they act unbridled on their feelings and desires, according to what they consider right in their own eyes. Then everything is acceptable: killing, prostitution, stealing, deceiving, abusing vulnerable people, and lying; in short, everything is justified by the following principle: “It’s what I want”; “It’s my will”; “If it’s going to harm someone, too bad for that person, the world belongs to those who are strong– it’s ‘survival of the fittest,'” etc.\nThis is the driving force for people who don’t have someone above them. They know that if they give some leeway and consider for a minute that there is a God, a creator, a judge to whom they will one day be accountable, they would have to change their way of being and acting radically. But since they don’t want to pay that price, they discard the idea that God exists.\nIn this biblical text, we also understand that God values those interested in knowing Him because there are people like that who despise Him.\n“FOR the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to Him.” 2 Chronicles 16:9\nThat’s what God does. He constantly inspects, sweeps, and searches this world for the sincere.\nHis Word teaches that when we speak to Him in the name of Jesus, we are heard, not for our merits, but because the name of His Son gives us this right.\nCheck out this message in full in the video above.\nhttps://www.universal.org/renato-cardoso/post/o-que-deus-faz-com-quem-nao-quer-conhece-lo/",
