  "text": "In an open letter to American Catholics dated 11 February 2025, Pope Francis directly challenges the Trump Administration’s desire – and by extension the desire of many conservative leaders in Europe – to impose a rule of law and sanctity of national borders. The Pope states:\n“The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the ‘Good Samaritan’ (cf.Lk 10:25-37), that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception. But worrying about personal, community or national identity, apart from these considerations, easily introduces an ideological criterion that distorts social life and imposes the will of the strongest as the criterion of truth.”\nPope Francis, as usual, tries to cloak Globalism in the mantle of the Magesterium. Christ also said, “For the poor you have always with you: but me you have not always.” (See, Matt. 26:11) The question Francis and his fellow social justice warriors ought to be asking is “What form of government has the least amount of poor?” Or, to quote Sir Winston Churchill “The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries.”\nAs such, American spiritual and economic engine must run on the fuel of free market economics, respect and integrity of private property rights, and security from external threats. As so brilliantly explained by author Tom Bethell in The Noblest Triumph: Property and Prosperity Through the Ages:\n“When property is privatized, and the rule of law is established, in such a way that all including the rulers themselves are subject to the same law, economies will prosper and civilization will blossom. Of the different possible configurations of property, only private property can have this desirable effect.” (Emphasis added)\nThreats to the United States today and into the foreseeable future recognize that The West’s center of gravity is the strength of our free market economy and our Constitutional Republican form of limited government: we are not a democracy, where the tyranny of mob rule. The primacy of these national interests as the foundation of our societal will to fight must be protected. President Trump, as well as conservative leaders here in Europe, merely wish to point out that an illegal alien is no more a citizen than a burglar is a member of the family. This ought not be an immoral or illogical point to any sane person.\nPope Francis ought to concentrate on running The Church, which he is flying into the ground.\nNot satisfied with merely expressing his ill-founded opinions on these matters of economics and national sovereignty outside of his jurisdiction, Pope Francis next openly foments dissent by American Catholics against their lawful civic authority:\n“I exhort all the faithful of the Catholic Church, and all men and women of good will, not to give in to narratives that discriminate against and cause unnecessary suffering to our migrant and refugee brothers and sisters. With charity and clarity we are all called to live in solidarity and fraternity, to build bridges that bring us ever closer together, to avoid walls of ignominy and to learn to give our lives as Jesus Christ gave his for the salvation of all.”\nThis should come of no surprise to anyone familiar with Pope Francis’s and his Society of Jesus’s support for radical Liberation Theology movements, which are nothing short of fomenting violent Communist revolution against Church and State in Latin America and now it appears the United States and Europe. Sadly, the worst frivolities and iconoclastic, fringe elements of Vatican II have become the new orthodoxy in the Church and Francis is their ringleader.\nPope Francis ought to concentrate on running The Church, which he is flying into the ground. He is promoting and celebrating every form of perversity with the likes of Father James Martin, S.J., while attacking the only group of Catholics that have growing and vibrant communities, Traditional Catholics attending the Latin Mass. From his celebration of the pagan Pachamama idol in the sacred ground of St. Peters (In Inca mythology Pachamama is fertility goddess who presides over planting and harvesting) to his welcoming (if not worshipping) radical LGBTQ+ elements to Rome in this supposed Holy Year, this Pope seems possessed by evil spirits.\nMoreover, if Pope St Pius V was such as feckless coward as Pope Francis there would have been no victory at the Battle of Lepanto on 7 October 1571 and the Ottoman Turks would have destroyed Christendom then and there. Christendom in Europe and the United States is under a clear and present danger from Islamification. It is clear that Pope Francis lacks the moral fiber to rally The Church in any meaningful way. As a Catholic, I pray for his exorcism and release from such spiritual disturbances. Or his successor: prayerfully a Traditional Roman Catholic.\nLatest from RTV — HELL in the HOLY LAND: Israel's Bishops Speak Out on Gaza",
