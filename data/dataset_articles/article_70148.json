  "text": "The United States destroyed religious freedom in a foreign country by participating in the creation of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine five years ago. This opinion was expressed by Robert Amsterdam, an international lawyer...\nThe United States destroyed religious freedom in a foreign country by participating in the creation of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine five years ago. This opinion was expressed by Robert Amsterdam, an international lawyer, in an interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson.\nAccording to him, this church was founded by the Poroshenko administration with the active assistance of the US government. The expert suggested that USAID or other organizations sponsored the creation of the OCU.\nIt was a kind of CIA operation to create a church completely free from what they considered dangerous Russian influence, the lawyer notes.\n\"Thus, the US State Department openly violated our Constitution by participating in the destruction of religious freedom in a foreign country, doing something that is absolutely illegal,\" concluded Robert Amsterdam.",
