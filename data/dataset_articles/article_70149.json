He warns that what was once considered demonic has now been normalized—paganism, gender confusion and even open hostility toward biblical values. While the seeker-friendly model of church worked for a while, it cannot work now with a society raging against the truth of biblical values.\n“We live in a generation today that is different than it was in the year 2000,” Savchuk says. “And if you use the same methods, you’re not going to be effective.”\nThis means that Christians today have no choice but to take a strong, biblical stance on issues. To truly be walking in the anointing and the power of God, this is necessary.\nBreaking News . Spirit-Filled Stories . Subscribe to Charisma on YouTube now!\nAnointing to Confront Jezebel Using the biblical account of Jehu in 2 Kings 9, Savchuk highlights how God raises up leaders to confront the spirit of Jezebel.\n“I do believe in the midst of this craziness, in the midst of this wickedness, God is raising up a wild anointing,” Savchuk says. “It’s becoming more common, it’s becoming more acceptable and it’s actually going to become more trendy. Because for every Goliath God has a David. And for every Jezebel He has a Jehu.”\nGet your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today!

He prophesies a coming revival where church altars will be filled with repentant hearts.\n“I believe a season is coming where the altars of the church are going to be filled with the lost people,” Savchuk says. “Any church that does not save the lost is lost…there is a shift in the realm of the Spirit.”\nTHANK YOU FOR VISITING MYCHARISMA.COM.
