  "text": "Rabbi Moshe Sternbuch, Raavad of the Eda Chareidis JERUSALEM (VINnews) — Rabbi Moshe Sternbuch, the head of the Eda Charedis in Jerusalem, spoke about the need to strengthen our trust in Hashem and not rely on external forces for our salvation.\nRabbi Sternbuch stressed that only when the Jewish nation realizes that there is no other way to salvation – only through Hashem.\n“We need to recognize that no army, no air force can save us. Many people rely on the new president in America that can help us, but they are delaying the arrival of Moshiach. We must realize that only from Hashem will come salvation.”\nFollow VINnews for Breaking News Updates",
