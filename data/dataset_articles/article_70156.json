  "text": "According to controversial Ghanaian man of God, Prophet Nicholas Osei aka Kumchacha, there is nothing good about marriage.\nAccording to him, if Jesus, the son of God, had married a woman during his time on earth, he would have ended up missing a ticket to heaven.\nKumchacha made these claims during an interview with Ghanaian YouTuber and vlogger, Felix Adomako Mensah, who professionally goes by the name ZionFelix.\nAccording to him, marriage usually brings little benefit and is actually rife with problems. He claimed that the saviour of the world, Jesus Christ himself was aware of this which is why he stayed away from women during his time on Earth.\n“If marriage were easy, Jesus Christ would have married himself. If he had taken a wife, he might have missed heaven—especially if he had married a difficult woman,” he said.\nKumchacha added that there are many great men suffering in life because they made the wrong choice and married a ‘difficult’ woman.\nHis comment completely sparked hilarious reactions from netizens who were left laughing their bums off!\nOver the years, Kumchacha has become known for making such outrageous comments and his latest did not disappoint.",
