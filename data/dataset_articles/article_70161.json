  "text": "I cannot understand what is happening anymore with 'Christians' at Christian events. I thought attending such events was about seeking, meeting, or engaging with the Holy Spirit or God through music.\nI have sat down to watch and attend these events in person, and I have noticed that people don't engage with God as they used to.\nWhy do I say this? Countless times, I have seen people lift their mobile phones to record when a minister climbs up on stage to perform, rather than engaging in fellowship.\nAre attendees there as videographers, or are they there to worship and have an encounter with God?\nPersonally, I think this behaviour is gradually becoming a nuisance in the country, and I feel something needs to be done about it.\nWhat is this phenomenon about? Christians, gospel artistes, and whoever is in charge should have a conversation about this issue.\nThe presence of mobile phones has drastically changed the atmosphere at these events. Instead of raising hands in praise, we see a sea of screens capturing every moment. This shift not only disrupts the sanctity of worship but also distracts both the worshippers and the ministers.\nThe essence of these gatherings is to connect with the divine, not to create content for social media. It’s important to remember that true worship is about the heart's posture before God, not about capturing the perfect shot.\nIn conclusion, we must address this issue and remind everyone of the real purpose behind attending Christian events. Let's put down our phones and lift up our hearts in genuine worship and fellowship.",
