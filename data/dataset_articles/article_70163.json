  "text": "“I was sad to learn this morning of the death of Bishop Willie Walsh, a caring pastor, inspired by love of the Gospel, and, as his own motto put it, a bishop living by ‘the gentleness of Christ’.\n“Throughout his almost 66 years of priesthood, Bishop Willie’s ministry demonstrated God’s love for all people – particularly those on the margins of society.\n“As President of the Irish Catholic Bishops’ Conference, I wish to acknowledge Bishop Willie’s steadfast commitment in support of sacramental marriage. This was evident in his role as President of the Catholic marriage care agency, Accord. Bishop Willie’s leadership in the area of marriage preparation, and counselling, was characterised by his support for all entering into Catholic marriage, as well as in his sincere compassion and outreach for those experiencing difficulties in their marriages and relationships, something which continues to inspire the work of Accord to this day.\n“In addition, I wish to acknowledge Bishop Willie’s strong contribution, from 1994 to 2010, to the work of the Bishops’ Conference, in particular as a member of the Episcopal Commissions for Pastoral Care, Social Welfare; Education; and, of Research and Development.\n“Bishop Willie was a gifted communicator who was a beloved figure in his native diocese of Killaloe, and throughout the country.\n“On behalf of my brother bishops, I wish to express my condolences to Bishop Willie’s family, to Bishop Fintan Monahan of Killaloe, to the priests, religious and faithful of the diocese, and to all who knew and loved him.\n“May Bishop Willie Walsh rest in peace, and may his legacy of love, service, and faith continue to inspire us all.\n“Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dilís.”\nENDS",
