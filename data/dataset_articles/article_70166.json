  "text": "There is no part of me that believes in a purgatory or a 'hell like' torment that would be temporary...punishment for a finite period of time.Our GOD is a consuming fire and the Lake of Fire at the end of the millennium is a permanent thing, this is why we do not fear one who can kill the body but the the ONE and only ONE that can destroy body AND soul...BUT there are people who DO think this way and while I have never done an in depth study on the matter...it's of little interest since I don't buy it....I did see this particular pair of scriptures this morning as I was plowing chapter by chapter/verse by verse and I CAN SEE where an individual could extrapolate such a theory from them. Just curious as to the thoughts of the little fellowship that participates in this sub-forum.\nMatthew 18 Let's assume we all know the parable about forgiveness and extending that forgiveness.....The king being rightfully angry says\n18:34 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.\nOur Lord Jesus Christ closes by saying...\n18:35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.\nI know what I believe, yet I am no fool...I am more than willing to learn and change WITH THE WORD...not without it. It's an interesting point of view that caused me to stop and think...Selah should happen more often than 74 times found in Psalms and Habakkuk",
