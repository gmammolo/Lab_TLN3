  "text": "4 Lies the Enemy Uses against Us from Genesis\nShare\n“Human history is the long, terrible story of man trying to find something other than God which will make him happy.” - C.S. Lewis\nThere are so many lies we buy into in an effort to find joy outside of a surrendered relationship with God. Genesis introduces sin, and in Genesis 3 we read the account of an interaction between the deceiver and the woman. This conversation reveals the lies that started humanity's long stint of wandering.\n“Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, ‘Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?’ The woman said to the serpent, ‘We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’’ ‘You will not certainly die,’ the serpent said to the woman. ‘For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.’ When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves” (Genesis 3:1-7, emphasis added).\nIn this passage of Scripture, we notice four lies the serpent uses to pull the first humans away from God’s best.\nPhoto credit: ©Getty Images/lchumpitaz\nAmanda Idleman is a writer whose passion is to encourage others to live joyfully.
