Akbar destroyed Hindu temples and committed atrocities on Hindu women. Instead, students should be taught of the greatness of Hindu Kings asserted Mahant Arun Dasji Maharaj of Jagannath Dham Shibir, successor of Jagadguru Shri Ramanandacharya Swami Hansdevacharyaji Maharaj. Sadguru Dr Charudatta Pingale recently called upon Maharaj. Maharaj also praised the work of the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti, saying that it is working to mould the youth in a good way.\nTags : Blessings of Saints Hindu Janajagruti Samiti HJS in Kumbh Mela Related News HJS’s appeal to the Government to make the film ‘Chhaava’ tax-free!
