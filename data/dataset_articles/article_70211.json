  "text": "Since the last General Conference took place, the United Methodist Church in West Virginia (WVUMC) has insisted that all viewpoints on sexual matters will be respected and that individual churches can act in accord with their conscience.\nRecent conference actions demonstrate that this is not the case. The WVUMC chose to update its Safe Sanctuaries policy to include a section on “LGBTQ+ Youth” and, despite its vague language, it is anything but inclusive.\nThe Safe Sanctuaries program began in 1996 with the admirable goal of preventing abuse within churches. Each conference adopts its own policy, and individual churches are supposed to use these guidelines to formulate plans for their individual churches. Laity, who work with children, are supposed to receive Safe Sanctuaries training.\nWhile the UMC’s Discipleship Ministries’ website has included guidelines on LGBTQ inclusion since the early 2010’s, not every conference chose to include them in their policies. The WVUMC was a conference that waited until after the General Conference made changes to The Book of Discipline regarding the church’s teaching on human sexuality.\nIn fact, the WVUMC’s policy prior to 2024 is remarkably clear of any references to gender identity or sexual orientation. Instead, the past policy focused on what it should focus on, reasonable standards to ensure no one would have access to abuse children.\nThe 2024 policy demonstrates a significant change in the conference’s public stance on the issue. This change is significant for several reasons. WV had a limited church exit compared with other conferences . One reason was that the WVUMC decided to narrowly interpret the wording about conscience in paragraph 2553 of The Book of Discipline . Its interpretation excluded traditionalists whom the conference claimed had no basis for conscience concerns.\nIt is significant then that the conference waited to include the “LGBTQ+ Youth guidelines”, which would have raised conscience concerns, until after General Conference and after the paragraph 2553 December 31 st deadline. I have spoken with several sources in the state who went through Safe Sanctuaries training, who were surprised by the changes to guidelines. The conference waited to adopt the guidelines into the conference policy until the exit deadline was passed and churches were trapped.\nWhile vague, the guidelines’ wording is anything but the neutrality WVUMC leadership promised congregants after General Conference. Guidelines include, “Avoid assumptions about a young person’s sexual orientation or gender identity; Respect and use chosen names and pronouns; Do not disclose information about someone you do not have explicit permission from that person to share; Stay educated on the proper use of terminology; Be intentional about creating and maintaining a safe environment and culture of awareness around derogatory language and bullying; Use gender-neutral spaces and terms as much as possible.”\nThe Discipleship Ministries’ website expands on these guidelines and makes clear it wants to “normalize” the behavior discussed.\nThese changes also impact the ability of traditionalists to participate in youth and children’s ministries. Do 85-year-old church ladies really need to keep up with modern gender terminology? According to the guidelines, they must. What do the guidelines mean by gender-neutral spaces? Little guidance is given in the WVUMC guidelines, but the Discipleship Ministries’ expanded guidelines seem to confirm the worst interpretation of the wording. Should parents be notified if their child “comes out” at a youth event? The guidelines suggest no. And traditionalists cannot affirm these requirements.\nThis is troubling because, if the guidelines represent the position of the conference, then ministry leaders, who require students to use restrooms according to their biological gender or who tell a parent about their child’s sexual decisions, will not have the support of the conference when challenged. Whether they say it publicly or not, the leadership of the WVUMC has decided that it has no room for traditionalists in their ministry to youth and children.\nThe policy itself makes clear that the church does not take a neutral stance on these issues, “While there is much discussion ongoing in The United Methodist Church about human sexuality, we are obligated as Methodists to “do no harm.” No theological position of the church changes our need to protect the children, youth, and vulnerable adults in our congregations.”\nThe guidelines will also be of concern to more traditional parents. Safe Sanctuaries was created to ensure the safety of youth, but the new guidelines have the potential to do the opposite. The new guidelines will make families feel uncomfortable in allowing their children to participate in ministries of the church.\nSignificantly, they also shift the focus of the policy away from its original intent. Churches should work to ensure the children in their care are safe from sexual abuse. The new guidelines focus on woke virtue signaling rather than the significant task of making sure churches are safe for children.\nFor congregants wondering if they can stay inside the WVUMC as traditionalists, the answer seems to be no. Sooner or later they will be expected to adopt a position that violates their conscience. When they feel they cannot do so, all the WVUMC’s talk about neutrality will do them no good. The WVUMC will not support them in the exercise of their conscience.\nAdoption of the guidelines in the WVUMC is simply one more example of the WVUMC’s exclusion of traditionalists from its vision of the church going forward.\nReveal Comments Reveal Tags No comments yet\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.
