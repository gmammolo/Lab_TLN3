  "text": "Alongside outdoor banners proclaiming service times and greetings to everyone, the home of Episcopalians in Manitou Springs for the past 120 years wears a cloak of sadness.\nSt. Andrews Episcopal Church, known as a stalwart source of spiritual sustenance and a model of Christian charity since its cornerstone was laid in 1905, is closing its Gothic Revival-style doors after a final deconsecration service at 5 p.m. on Thursday, March 6, with the Rt. Rev. Kym Lukas, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Colorado, presiding.\nRemaining Sunday services will be held at 10 a.m. on Feb. 23 and March 2, with the Rev. Kathy Macek presiding.\n“For over a century, this sacred space has been a beacon of faith, hope and service — offering worship, fellowship and unwavering support to the Manitou Springs community,” said Canon Mike Orr, spokesman for the Episcopal Church in Colorado, which is headquartered in Denver. “From the warmth of Sunday services to the generosity of the food pantry and the embrace of our outreach programs, St. Andrews has stood as a pillar of love and care.”\nAs the building is shuttered and either goes on the market for sale or is repurposed for another ministry or use in line with the denomination’s mission, that spirit will live on, Orr said.\n“We give thanks for all who have been part of this journey, trusting that God’s work will continue in new and meaningful ways,” he said.\nSt. Andrews' main outreach ministries — the Manitou Springs Community Food Pantry and Silver Key Senior Services' hot meal program — will continue at different locations.\nSilver Key will move its Monday through Friday lunch for seniors ages 60 and older to Community Congregational Church of Manitou Springs at 103 Pawnee Ave., likely beginning March 3, said Laurie Wood, the organization’s chief grants and compliance officer.\n“It’s not just a hot meal, it’s also a way to get out of the house, see other people, build community and find out about Silver Key’s other services for seniors,” she said.\nThe new site has free parking and space to expand, she said. Between 10 and 20 people now attend regularly.\nAnd the Community Pantry of Manitou Springs said on Facebook it is searching for a new location to host its weekly food distribution. “(St. Andrews) has graciously hosted the Manitou Springs Community Pantry since its inception, and our hearts go out to the entire congregation during this difficult time,” organizers posted.\nCommunity Congregational Church, a United Church of Christ affiliate, stands in solidarity with St. Andrews, said the Rev. Heather McDuffee, pastor.\n“Our church feels a real camaraderie with St. Andrews — we’ve done ecumenical services with them, and we want to be there for them,” she said. “Churches are closing all over; it’s a direct response to a post-COVID world, with volunteerism and nonprofit giving going down, and it’s important we care for those who quite literally live next door.”\nLeaders of Colorado’s Episcopal Diocese have grappled with whether to close St. Andrews for more than a decade, as attendance has averaged 31 people per service and dropped to less than 20 during the pandemic, Orr said. Attendance last year averaged 12 congregants each service.\nDonations also have decreased to the point of not being plentiful enough to maintain and sustain a viable congregation, he said. Collection plate contributions and pledges totaled $44,513 in 2023, records show. On top of that, the church has been led by “short-term supply clergy” for the past two years.\n“Closing a church is never a failure; it is a recognition that the church’s mission continues in new and evolving ways,” Orr said. “Sometimes, closing doors allows space for new ministries to be planted and fresh opportunities to emerge.”\nSt. Andrews’ departure joins a handful of Episcopalian churches to shut down over the past decade, Orr said, but statewide the diocese is growing. Colorado’s 95 Episcopal churches collectively saw average attendance of nearly 6,800 per Sunday in 2023, he said, which reflected a 10.4% increase over 2022.\nAnd, “Several new Episcopal worshipping communities have taken root across Colorado, reflecting the ongoing movement of the Holy Spirit,” Orr said. “We are excited for the possibilities ahead and the ways God will continue to work to bring hope, healing and renewal.”\nUpon St. Andrews’ closure, the diocese will assume control over remaining assets and determine the “appropriate disposition of the property,” he said. The 1905 Kimball pipe organ remains inside the church.",
