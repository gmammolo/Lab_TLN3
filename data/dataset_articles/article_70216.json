  "text": "Growing up as a child, I was always taught about the martyrs of the Apostles in Sunday School. Anyone reading about how each of them was murdered would be filled with fear and sorrow, wondering how one could endure such ordeals for their faith. To the carnal man, it may seem like a wasted life, but to the spiritual man, it is a pivotal act that strengthens faith in the Lord and spreads the undiluted Gospel of Christ.\nLooking at the Apostles of old and how they served God, one can easily conclude that today’s generation of churches is spiritually sick. It is disheartening to witness the negative transformation from those times to now.\nHOW DID WE GET HERE?\nToday's pulpit has, unfortunately, driven people away from Christ instead of drawing them closer. The spiritual messages of salvation have been replaced with sermons on comfort, materialism, and self-gratification. People no longer seek Christ for who He is but rather use Him as a means to fulfill their worldly ambitions.\nThe common messages preached today revolve around tithes, offerings, breakthroughs, and mantles. We rarely hear about the crucified Lord, the risen Lord, or the glorified Jesus. Many believers have little to no understanding of salvation, and the desire to carry one's cross has diminished. No one wants to suffer for Christ because we have been told that difficulties in life are either the result of a generational curse or personal sin.\nBut were the Apostles cursed when they were martyred for their faith in Christ? Absolutely not! Yet, false teachings have demonized the message of the cross. Many do not realize that coming to Christ also means becoming partakers in His sufferings. Instead, we preach half-truths and promise heaven on earth. This distortion of the Gospel has fueled the desire for worldly possessions, leading to immorality and corruption in our society.\nBLESSINGS WRONGLY DEFINED\nOne of the major ills of today’s church is the attempt by false prophets and teachers to redefine blessings and prosperity. The blessings of God have been reduced to material wealth, and whenever the word \"blessing\" is mentioned, people immediately think of large bank accounts, luxurious mansions, or multi-million-dollar businesses.\nSadly, those who do not possess these things are often seen as failures or poor. As a result, many people live beyond their means to impress others, while others sit in church feeling disappointed because God has not \"blessed\" them with a car or financial abundance. This disease in the church has caused many to be ungrateful and unappreciative of the true gifts God has freely given us—life and salvation.\nEphesians 1:3 (NIV)\n\"Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.\"\nOur blessings are primarily spiritual, not just what the eye can see. We must heal the church from the misconception that worldly possessions, wealth, and fame are the only signs of God’s blessings. Joseph prospered even while in prison, despite having no material wealth.\nSo why are pastors not preaching about Christ and the gift of salvation? Why is so much emphasis placed on money, cars, and fame? This is indeed a sickness in the church.\nTHE ABUSE OF FATHERHOOD\nAnother disturbing trend in today’s church is the so-called “spiritual fatherhood” syndrome. Many believers are more devoted to their so-called spiritual fathers than to Christ Himself. In fact, they show more loyalty to these men than to God. They know their \"father\" well but have little knowledge of Christ.\nThis unhealthy obsession has led to personality cults within the church. Instead of leading people to Christ, some leaders direct their followers to themselves. They create the false impression that blessings can only be received through them because they are supposedly closer to God than their followers.\nThis manipulative behavior has enslaved many Christians, making them afraid to leave even when they discover the truth. They fear that walking away will bring a curse or even death upon them.",
