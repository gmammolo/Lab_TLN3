  "text": "In Poltava region, the court ordered to 'refute' a comment... criticizing the Moscow Patriarchate.\nReligious conflict in Hradizka community\nA resident of the Hradizka community in Poltava region expressed his dissatisfaction that the local branch of the UOC MP is not transitioning to the OCU. He pointed out that the priest of the local Moscow Patriarchate church is the father of the head of the village council. This caused protests, and the Globyn district court forced the commentator to apologize and retract his statement. This was reported on the website 'Business Capital'.\nAccording to the article, the branches of the UOC MP continue their active activities despite the law that prohibits the Russian church. However, some local authorities exhibit passivity or sabotage the enforcement of this law, making its effective implementation impossible.\nSince the beginning of the war, the Security Service has opened more than 100 criminal proceedings against priests of the UOC MP. They continue to spread propaganda on behalf of the Kremlin, criticize the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and support the Russian peace. Even the enacted law cannot change the situation. Some communities are trying to ban the presence of the UOC MP on their territory and refuse to lease them land. But there are also those who publicly support the priests of the Moscow Patriarchate, as mentioned in the article.\nIn this specific case, in the Hradizka community of Poltava region, the head is Myroslav Nosa, and his father is a priest of the UOC MP. In this locality, two religious communities - the OCU and the UOC MP - operate simultaneously. The local authorities are trying to avoid a public discussion of this conflict. When a resident of the village spread information about the situation on Facebook, the court ordered him to remove his post. He was forced to publish an apology.\nRead also",
