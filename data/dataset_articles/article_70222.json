  "text": "Freedom From Religion Foundation’s television showsheds light on a Catholic organization that has had a pernicious influence on the United States — and globally.\nGareth Gore’s new book is called “Opus: The Cult of Dark Money, Human Trafficking and Right-Wing Conspiracy inside the Catholic Church.” Publishers Weekly, in a starred review, calls the work a chilling debut exposé. Gore is a financial journalist based in London who has reported from more than two dozen countries. He’s been published by Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters and International Financing Review.\n“What Opus Dei tries to do is, get its members into positions of power and then encourages them to use the positions of power to basically push forward the Opus Dei reactionary agenda, to push back on any kind of progressive forces in society,” Gore tells “Freethought Matters” co-hosts Dan Barker and Annie Laurie Gaylor. He also discusses Opus Dei’s influence on some members of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n“Freethought Matters” airs the weekend in:\n-\nChicago, WPWR-CW (Ch. 50), Sundays at 9 a.m.\n-\nLos Angeles, KCOP-MY (Ch. 13), Sundays at 8:30 a.m.\n-\nMadison, Wis., WISC-TV (Ch. 3), Sundays at 11 p.m.\n-\nNew York City, WPIX-IND (Ch. 11), Sundays at 10 a.m.\n-\nSan Francisco, KTVU/KICU-IND (on broadcast Ch. 36 and Cable 6), Sundays at 10 a.m.\n-\nWashington, D.C., WDCW-CW (Ch. 50 or Ch. 23 or Ch. 3), Sundays at 8 a.m.\nIf you don’t live in any of the marquee towns where the show broadcasts on Sunday, you can already catch the interview on FFRF’s YouTube channel. New shows go up every Thursday.\nUpcoming shows include an interview with religious trauma counselor Janice Selbie. You can catch interviews from earlier this season and from previous seasons here, including with Gloria Steinem, Ron Reagan, author John Irving, actor John “Q” de Lancie and award-winning columnist Katha Pollitt.\nPlease tune in to “Freethought Matters” . . . because freethought matters. And spread the word to freethinking friends, family or colleagues about a TV show, finally, that is dedicated to providing programming for freethinkers — your antidote to religion on Sunday morning! Plus, during Halloween weekend, it will be a good way to recover your wits.\nP.S. Please tune in or record according to the times given above regardless of what is listed in your TV guide (it may be listed simply as “paid programming” or even be misidentified). To set up an automatic weekly recording, try taping manually by time or channel.",
