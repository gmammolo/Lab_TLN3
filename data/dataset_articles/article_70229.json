  "text": "Unveiling the truth: An Expert Analysis of the Italian Miracle Statue Hoax A purported miracle involving a statue of the Virgin Mary in Trevignano , Italy, has been exposed as a hoax following scientific testing . The incident,beginning in 2016,captivated believers worldwide and generated substantial donations.\nGisella Cardia claimed the statue not only wept blood and tears but also delivered divine messages, positioning herself as the Virgin Mary’s spokesperson .Cardia organized monthly pilgrimages on the third of each month, attracting numerous devotees. She further fueled the fervor by claiming to perform miracles, such as feeding 15 people with a meager amount of pizza, potatoes, and dough—a feat reminiscent of the biblical “five loaves and two fishes.” Cadia arranges pilgrimage to believers on the third day of each month. She also claims to witness paranormal phenomena, such as feeding 15 people with a very small amount of pizza, potatoes, and dough, similar to the “five cakes and two fish” in the Bible. The miracle.\nThe alleged miracle attracted a considerable following, with believers donating tens of thousands of dollars to Cardia’s religious activities. Many firmly believed in Cardia’s claims, some even asserting she accurately predicted the 2019 coronavirus outbreak. However, skepticism simmered among some residents, prompting a private examination in 2022.\nGrowing doubts led local prosecutors to intervene in 2023, launching an investigation to determine the origin of the red liquid on the statue. Initial speculation pointed to pig blood. However, recently released test results revealed a shocking truth: the DNA from the bloodstains matched that of Gisella Cardia herself. According to the Daily Mail, as the doubts grew louder, local prosecutors finally intervened in the investigation in 2023 to identify the source of the red liquid on the Virgin Image. There were initial rumors that the liquid might be pig blood. However, recently released test results showed that the DNA of these blood stains was consistent with that of Cadia himself. Cardia has as left Trevignano, and her lawyer is reportedly unable to contact her.\nThe Catholic Church maintained a cautious stance throughout the ordeal. Last year, the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith reviewed the incident under newly established guidelines, concluding that the “miracle” lacked supernatural elements. The local parish also issued a statement explicitly declaring the statue’s bleeding “not a miracle.”\nThe “Bloody Madonna” phenomenon isn’t unique to Trevignano. Similar incidents have been reported globally. In 2018, a statue of the Virgin of the mystic Rose in argentina reportedly “bled” for the 38th time, with some believers attributing miraculous tumor remission to the statue. That same year, a statue of the Virgin Mary in New Mexico, USA, was reported to be oozing olive oil, sparking a pilgrimage. In 2017,a statue of La Morenita in Acapulco,mexico,also drew attention for a reported “sweating” incident.\nThe Trevignano case serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the importance of critical thinking and scientific verification even in matters of faith.
