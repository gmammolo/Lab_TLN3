  "text": "Mahakumbh 2025: Political Row Over Sangam Water, Akhilesh Targets BJP\nAs millions of devotees arrive in Prayagraj to take a holy dip in the Sangam during Mahakumbh 2025, a political controversy has erupted over the water’s cleanliness. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath claimed on Wednesday that the Sangam’s water is not just suitable for bathing but also fit for drinking. He accused certain groups of trying to tarnish the image of the grand religious event.Responding to this, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav took a dig at the ruling BJP, stating that if the Sangam’s water is indeed drinkable, it should be sent to BJP leaders’ homes for cooking and bathing. His remarks have further fueled the ongoing political debate.With Mahakumbh 2025 being a major spiritual and cultural event, the cleanliness of the Sangam’s water remains a sensitive issue, now turning into a political battleground between the ruling and opposition parties.",
