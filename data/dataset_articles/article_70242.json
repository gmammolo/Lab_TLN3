  "text": "In a clear violation of canon law, Vivian Schwanke De Oliveira, a minister of the Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil, “concelebrated” the Sunday, February 9, Mass for the installation of the archbishop of the Archdiocese of Chapecó in St. Anthony Cathedral. The minister entered the church wearing a white alb and a blue stole, together with the priests and bishops in the entrance procession; she remained in the sanctuary, actively participated in the consecration of the Eucharist and received Communion.",
