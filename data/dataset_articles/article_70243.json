  "text": "On Tuesday, Tom Homan made disrespectful and hurtful remarks about the Pope, showing a lack of respect for the religious head of 1.5 billion Catholics globally.\nAnd it warmed my heart.\nFrom a Reuters story regarding a letter the Pope wrote to American bishops:\nIn a recent statement, the Pope criticized Trump’s deportation agenda, emphasizing that it is unfair to label all undocumented immigrants as criminals.\nThe pontiff urged all members of the Catholic Church to reject discriminatory narratives that harm migrant and refugee communities, promoting compassion and solidarity instead.\nFrancis, pope since 2013, has long been critical of Trump’s immigration policies. In 2016, during Trump’s first White House campaign, the pope said Trump was “not Christian” in his views on immigration.”\nResponding to that letter, Border Czar Tom Homan (a lifelong Catholic himself) said, “I’ve got harsh words for the Pope.” He continued, “He ought to fix the Catholic Church and concentrate on his work and leave border enforcement to us.”\nKaboom. Well, that’s a solid gut punch delivered. Basically: Clean up your own matters with pedophila and global pervert trafficking. Until that’s done and well in the past maybe you get to lecture people again. Maybe, if there are any Catholics who still listen to you.\nNow, there’s a lot that can be dissected in this reply by Homan, but my point here is to say something about the Pope.\nFirst, I don’t like this man. I think this man is a socialist born of the Liberation Theologies of the 1980s. I was a reporter for a Catholic newspaper in the 80s while a seminarian for the priesthood, and had to cover a lot of protests by militant nuns, peace and justice activists, and Jesuits like the Berrigan brothers who liked to make their points by throwing blood on stuff. A lot of this type of behavior was fueled by Jesuit thinking. At the time, I was attending Rockhurst College (part of the Jesuit system like St. Louis University, Fordham, Creighton, etc….I was studying for another order, not the Jesuits, by the way), and these assignments did not particularly sit well with my gut.",
