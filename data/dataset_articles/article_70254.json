  "text": "Rise of the Demonic: Derek Prince’s Warning in Today’s Culture\nWe must ask ourselves: Have we ignored the warning signs?\nDecades ago, Bible teacher Derek Prince warned of the dangers of seeking supernatural knowledge outside of God. Today, his words ring truer than ever as the occult infiltrates mainstream culture, from Taylor Swift’s music laced with dark spiritual themes to Blizzard Entertainment’s ‘Diablo IV’ online gamin community normalizing demonic imagery, and Hocus Pocus teaching young audiences that witchcraft is harmless fun. The enemy is no longer hiding in the shadows—he is flaunting his influence in broad daylight.\nPrince made one thing clear: “Almost any form of supernatural knowledge is very, very dangerous.” He emphasized that there are only two sources of supernatural power—God or Satan. “If it doesn’t come from God, it does come from the devil.” Yet, today’s culture encourages people, particularly young audiences, to explore the dark arts. From Ouija boards to tarot cards, these practices are no longer just lurking in obscure corners of occult bookstores; they are sold in mainstream retailers, promoted on social media and glamorized in entertainment.\nBreaking News. Spirit-Filled Stories. Subscribe to Charisma on YouTube now!\nWe see evidence of this in music, movies and video games with companies and artists incorporating occultic imagery and lyrics that openly reference summoning spirits. Taylor Swift’s “Willow” music video, for instance, showcases ritualistic imagery that mirrors actual pagan, aka demonic, practices. Prince warned of this deception, explaining that many unknowingly tie themselves to false gods through supernatural pursuits: “If we get into any other supernatural realm of visions or revelations or knowledge or prediction, and we didn’t go by Jesus Christ, we got into the realm of evil and of Satan.”\nPrince also noted how the occult often follows generational lines, passing through family bloodlines: “A grandmother who’s a fortune-teller or a clairvoyant is liable to have one favorite grandchild… that favorite grandchild will be the recipient of that evil supernatural power.” This warning should make parents and grandparents take notice—what spiritual doors are being opened in their children’s lives through exposure to modern occultic trends?\nGet your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today! Stay up-to-date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more!\nThe modern world has embraced the demonic without discernment, dismissing biblical warnings as outdated superstition. But as Prince rightly stated, “We need to repent, we need to revoke the claim that they have over us, and we need to loose ourselves from their dark evil influence.”\nThe question now is: Will we heed this warning, or continue to let darkness infiltrate our homes, our schools and our entertainment?\nJoin Charisma Magazine Online to follow everything the Holy Spirit is doing around the world!\nJames Lasher is staff writer for Charisma Media.",
