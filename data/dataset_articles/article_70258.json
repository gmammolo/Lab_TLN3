  "text": "Fact Check: No, Ghosts Are Not Bathing At Prayagraj Maha Kumbh\nA Brazil police surveillance video using thermal cameras is falsely claimed as visuals of ghosts bathing at the 2025 Prayagraj Mahakumbh. The figures are actually humans detected by infrared cameras\nA video going viral on social media (here, here, and here) seemingly taken from a helicopter, first shows orange-coloured figures in water. The post is being shared with claims that these figures are ghosts bathing in the ongoing 2025 Prayagraj Mahakumbh. Let’s verify the truth behind the video in this article.\nrelated stories\nThe archived post can be found here.\nTo verify the claim, we conducted a reverse image search of keyframes from the viral video which led us to the same video posted on the Instagram handle bpmoa.pmpr on 19 January 2025. The translated caption from Portuguese to English states that the Falco Project aircraft, equipped with advanced technology, is assisting in night surveillance alongside the state’s remotely piloted aircraft. It advises holidaymakers against entering the water at night due to low visibility and the risk of strong currents, urging them to avoid swimming under the influence of alcohol. The post emphasizes that while the Paraná Military Police and the Military Fire Department are on alert, personal safety begins with individual responsibility and caution.\nThe Instagram bio states that the handle is associated with BPMOA/PMPR (Military Police Air Operations Battalion / Military Police of Paraná) – Air Operations and is a digital creator dedicated to making a difference by providing excellent air support whenever and wherever needed. It also mentions that it is the 👮 Official profile; however, we could not independently verify this.\nWe found a similar video on this Instagram account that shows police patrolling the Verão Maior Paraná events in Paraná, Brazil. In this footage, the screens are monitored in the same on-and-off manner as seen in the viral video, and the people on the screen also appear in orange colour.\nTo learn more about the orange figure visible on the helicopter’s dashboard screen, we conducted a Google keyword search and found that this technique is called thermographic inspection. Helicopters are equipped with thermal cameras to monitor the ground, aiding search and rescue operations during emergencies. These cameras are also useful for detecting humans at night. Also known as infrared cameras, they work by capturing infrared radiation emitted from the human body and converting it into an image.\nSeveral news reports highlight Brazil’s police (here and here)using helicopters for surveillance and emergency rescue operations for rapid response.\nWe contacted the BPMOA (Military Police Air Operations Battalion) for more information and will update this article once we receive a response.\nTo sum up, a Brazil police surveillance video using thermal cameras is falsely claimed as visuals ghosts bathing at the 2025 Prayagraj Mahakumbh.\nThis story was originally published by Factly, as part of the Shakti Collective.
