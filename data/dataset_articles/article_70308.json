  "text": "By Tom Wrobleski | wrobleski@siadvance.com A cardinal from Italy, a former top Vatican official, has said that ailing Pope Francis could resign from office.\nHis comments come as doctors said that Francis, 88, who is battling pneumonia in the hospital, “is not out of danger.”\nCardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, the former head of the Vatican’s department of cultural affairs, raised the possibility of resignation as Francis spent his sixth day in the hospital, the Telegraph reported.\nHe said that Francis had always been “decisive” and hinted that the pontiff might voluntarily step aside as leader of the Roman Catholic Church if his health restricted his ability to fulfill his duties, including personally interacting with Catholics.\nRavasi said Francis has a tendency to “fight,” but may consider resigning if he was no longer able to communicate in an “immediate, incisive and decisive way.”\nThe pope was rushed to Gemelli Hospital in Rome last Friday with significant chest pain. Francis had for days resisted calls to leave the Vatican.\nDoctors diagnosed him with a “complex” respiratory infection and barred him from taking part in a number of engagements. The Vatican canceled or rescheduled his papal audiences this week.\nThe Vatican on Tuesday confirmed the pneumonia diagnosis in both lungs and said Francis' respiratory infection also involves asthmatic bronchitis, which requires the use of cortisone antibiotic treatment.\nRavasi’s comments come amid reports that rehearsals are being held for Francis’ funeral, with Swiss Guards at the Vatican preparing for the pope’s passing, according to the Swiss newspaper Blick and reported by the Daily Mail.\nAccording to a report in Politico , Francis has told two people close to him that he “might not make it this time.”\nThe Daily Mail on Friday reported the pope’s doctors saying that Francis “is not out of danger” and would remain in the hospital for at least another week.\nAt a press conference in Rome, the physician team said that Francis “wants his condition reported to the world without hiding anything.”\nIn response to a reporter’s question, Dr. Sergio Alfieri said that the pope is not in danger of death.\nFrancis was elected pope in 2013, following the resignation of his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI.\nBenedict was the first pope to resign the papal office in more than 600 years and was the first pope to resign voluntarily since 1294.\nMost Popular Stories by Tom Wrobleski Trump fatigue already?
