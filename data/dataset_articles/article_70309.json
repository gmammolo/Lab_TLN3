  "text": "\"Fag*otry\" Apud Francisco, the Pope: Sings a Jota for the Pope, Reported for Homosexuality to the Diocese and for Harassment of a Seminarian to the Court\nJesús Roy, who was not admitted to the Tarazona seminary due to sexual scandals, was accepted into the Osma-Soria seminary, receiving formation at the Burgos seminary under Mario Iceta. Here, he sings a Jota for the Pope during a visit of Burgos seminarians to the Pope.\nThis article uncovers a widespread scandal within the Spanish Catholic Church, particularly in Aragón, exposing networks of cover-ups, favoritism, and sexual misconduct among seminarians and clergy. It highlights how Bishop José Antonio Satué of Teruel-Albarracín is promoting problematic seminarians like Isaí Zarza, while simultaneously persecuting members of Opus Dei, such as Chema Martínez, through a manipulated ecclesiastical trial.\nKey Issues:\n1. Sexual Misconduct, Harassment, and Protection of Compromised Seminarians\n-Jesús Roy, a widely admired seminarian, has been reported for harassment and sexual misconduct. Along with his lover, Isaí Zarza, he harassed a fellow seminarian via late-night calls, mocking him for his conservative faith and calling him “too pious” and “crazy.”\n-Isaí Zarza was expelled from the Zaragoza seminary after being caught masturbating with another seminarian but was later reintegrated into the clergy through networks of clerical protection.\n-Daniel Clemente, another seminarian implicated in sexual misconduct, has already been ordained despite photographic and video evidence against him.\n2. The Role of Miguel Ángel Estella in Covering Up and Promoting Homosexual Seminarians\n-Miguel Ángel Estella, a key priest within the Zaragoza Archdiocese, provided shelter to Isaí Zarza after his expulsion, justifying his actions as \"youthful mistakes.\"\n-Estella has been instrumental in promoting seminarians with known homosexual relationships, supporting Zarza's return to seminary life despite his history of misconduct.\n-He has actively endorsed vocations for seminarians involved in same-sex relationships, raising concerns about deliberate clerical networks protecting morally compromised candidates.\n3. Institutional Hypocrisy and Selective Justice\n-Bishop José Antonio Satué, while orchestrating a biased tribunal against Opus Dei member Chema Martínez, is simultaneously pushing forward the ordination of Isaí Zarza, despite negative reports and concrete evidence of his past behavior.\n-Javier Pérez Mas, rector of the Zaragoza seminary and head of the Office for Receiving Reports of Sexual Abuse, received photographic and video evidence of misconduct involving seminarians Jesús Roy, Isaí Zarza, and Daniel Clemente but still approved Clemente’s ordination and is set to approve Zarza’s diaconate.\n-This double standard—persecuting some while protecting others—raises questions about whether Church discipline is based on moral principles or political and ideological interests.\n4. Clerical Power Networks and Hidden Agendas\n-Jesuit Germán Arana and Cardinal Omella, influential figures in shaping the Spanish Church’s leadership, are believed to be using figures like Bishop Satué to consolidate their influence.\n-Vicente López-Brea, a former priest and lover of Isaí Zarza, is linked to a larger ecclesiastical and political scandal in Aragón, showing how networks of clerical protection extend beyond the seminary.\n-The connection between Estella, López-Brea, and Satué demonstrates an organized effort to advance certain seminarians despite moral disqualifications.\n5. The Broader Consequences: Moral Crisis and Institutional Collapse\n-This scandal weakens the credibility of the Spanish Church, showing that its disciplinary measures are arbitrary, favoring certain individuals while destroying others.\n-The crisis of vocations in Aragón has led to the ordination of unsuitable candidates, compromising the future integrity of the priesthood.\n-The persecution of Opus Dei members, like Chema Martínez, suggests a larger agenda within the Spanish Church to control and suppress conservative factions.\nThe Spanish Church’s Moral Integrity at Stake\nThe article exposes a Church leadership that is compromised by favoritism, ideological manipulation, and selective enforcement of discipline. Figures like Bishop Satué, Miguel Ángel Estella, and Javier Pérez Mas have allowed problematic seminarians to advance, while simultaneously persecuting others for political convenience. If these systemic cover-ups and abuses are not addressed, the Church in Spain faces a deepening crisis of credibility and moral legitimacy.\nYou may want to read this article from the original source in Spanish, also for more links and pictures.
