  "text": "Bad biblical takes are common — especially on social media platform X — but Allie Beth Stuckey of “Relatable” believes one recent interpretation of the word of God may take the cake for the worst of them.\nThe interpretation comes from American evangelical pastor and author of “The Purpose Driven Life,” Rick Warren, who seems to be under the impression that Jesus Christ was a fence-sitter.\n“John 19:18, ‘They crucified Jesus with two others — one on each side and Jesus in the middle.’ The guys on both sides were thieves. If you’re looking for the #realJesus, not a caricature disfigured by partisan motivations, you’ll find him in the middle, not on either side,” Warren wrote in a post on X.\n“Now, brothers and sisters in Christ, it took me a good second to understand what brother Warren is saying here,” Stuckey says. “Certainly, a pastor, who has been a pastor for so many years, is not saying because Jesus was physically in the center of Golgotha, that he had two people being crucified to his side, that he is also the center of Republican and Democrats.”\n“He’s not saying that he’s politically moderate because the cross was in the middle of the three crosses when he was crucified,” she continues, adding, “but it does seem like that is what he is saying.”\nStuckey responded to Warren on X through a quote tweet, writing, “This is possibly the worst biblical interpretation I’ve ever seen, and that’s really saying something. Jesus is not ‘in the middle’ on the murder of children, gender deception, the definition of marriage, or anything else, for that matter. In fact, I seem to remember Him having a particular disdain for the lukewarm.”\n“It’s very clear on what God thinks about the sanctity of life, the value of image bearers, the definition of marriage, the definition of gender. It’s not confusing, it’s only confusing if you want it to be for your political purposes,” she adds.\nWant more from Allie Beth Stuckey?\nTo enjoy more of Allie’s upbeat and in-depth coverage of culture, news, and theology from a Christian, conservative perspective, subscribe to BlazeTV — the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.\nThe post Jesus Christ was ‘in the middle’: The WORST biblical interpretation of all time appeared first on TheBlaze.",
