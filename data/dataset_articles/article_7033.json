  "text": "A pedestrian was taken to the hospital Wednesday afternoon after being struck by a vehicle on State Street in Santa Barbara.\nEmergency personnel were dispatched shortly after 4:30 p.m to the incident on State at Los Olivos Street, according to Sgt. Kyle Crooks of the Santa Barbara Police Department.\nThe pedestrian was found down in the roadway, but was conscious and breathing, Crooks said.\nWitnesses told Noozhawk that the man lived nearby, and regularly took a walk in the area.\nThe vehicle reportedly was a Sprinter-type van.\nThe man, whose name and condition were not available, was taken by AMR ambulance to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.\nTraffic on State Street was blocked off for a time after the collision, which was under investigation by the Police Department.",
