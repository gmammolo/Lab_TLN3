  "text": "Chernivtsi, Chernivtsi Province, Ukraine, February 21, 2025\nGod-fearing Orthodox Christians of the western Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi were forced to spend the night in their churches to protect them against the threat of seizure this week.\nThe faithful gathered in the Holy Spirit Cathedral, the Church of St. Nicholas, and the Church of Sts. Peter and Paul, which the godless schismatics of the “Orthodox Church of Ukraine” are intent on violently seizing. While the local Orthodox Christians have voted to remain faithful to Christ in the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church, a group of unaffiliated people have already voted to force the churches out of the Church and into the OCU.\nThankfully, the night of February 19–20 passed peacefully and prayerfully, reports the Union of Orthodox Journalists.\nIn the morning, His Eminence Metropolitan Meletiy of Chernivtsi celebrated the Divine Liturgy in the cathedral, which was filled with believers dedicated to protecting their holy site.\nOutside of the Liturgy, prayer continued around the clock, with akathists to the Lord, the Most Holy Theotokos, and the saints of God.\nThe hierarch encouraged his flock, saying: “We believe that the Lord will bless everyone who holds to the Orthodox faith. The Lord will send grace to those who love Christ’s Church, who know Christ’s path, which is thorny and difficult, but which leads to salvation.”\nFollow OrthoChristian on Twitter, Vkontakte, Telegram, WhatsApp, MeWe, and Gab!",
