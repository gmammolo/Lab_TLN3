  "text": "Pope confidant: Francis is tired and resignation is possible\nVatican City - Pope Francis has been in hospital for just under a week. Now the word resignation has been mentioned several times to journalists. The head of the Church is tired, says a confidant of the Pope and potential successor.\nPublished on 20.02.2025 at 15:31 –The Pope's confidant and Archbishop of Marseille, Cardinal Jean-Marc Aveline, has commented on Francis' hospitalisation. The Pope is tired, Aveline told journalists at the Vatican on Thursday afternoon. He may not have more information than the media, but Francis is one of those people: \"If you really want him to rest, you have to hospitalise him, because otherwise he will never rest.\"\nAveline, who is also being rumoured as a possible successor to Francis, did not rule out the possibility of the head of the church resigning: \"Anything is possible!\" Everything is being followed with a certain amount of concern, but without trying to make predictions or chase after news. The best and shortest way from one person to another is prayer. \"That's my way of keeping up to date,\" says Aveline about how he is dealing with the current situation of the sick Pope. Francis has been receiving treatment for a complicated respiratory infection at the Gemelli Clinic in Rome since Friday.\nCuria cardinal: situation \"complex but not critical\"\nThe Italian Cardinal of the Curia, Gianfranco Ravasi, had previously told the Italian radio station RTL 102.5 that he believed the Pope would resign due to his personality. Despite his physical infirmity, he has so far refused to do so. But, Ravasi continued: \"If he were in a situation in which his ability to have direct contact with people was severely restricted, then I believe he could decide to resign.\"\nRavasi recalled that Pope Francis, according to his own statement, had already handed over a conditional letter of resignation to the Cardinal Secretary of State at the beginning of his pontificate. Regarding the Pope's current condition, Ravasi said on Thursday that according to the information provided by the Vatican, the situation is \"complex but not critical\". (KNA)",
