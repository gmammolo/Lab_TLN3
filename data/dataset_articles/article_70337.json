  "text": "Posted By: earlybird,\n2/21/2025 4:32:45 PM\nThe University of Notre Dame has been on a decades-long warpath of undermining its Catholic mission at the altar of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) ideology. But that drive could be on a collision course with the Trump administration’s threat to revoke federal funding from DEI schools. Just before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President Donald Trump, Notre Dame Provost John McGreevy sent a faculty-wide email stating that the hiring priorities of the school were to increase “the number of women and underrepresented minorities” and that those DEI goals were “equally important” to hiring Catholic faculty.",
