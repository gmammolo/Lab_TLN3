  "text": "Why church leaders are not doing well, by Reverend Aina\nThe Chief Executive Officer of Christian Leadership Skills Incorporated, Reverend Albert Aina, has said that church leaders are not doing well today because they lack adequate training on how to manage people and church administration, arguing that many of them are preoccupied with what he described as A. B. C. which according to him, means attendance, building and cash.\nAina called on church leaders to see beyond attendance, building and cash, and embrace the latest trend in church management, which his organisation is offering to church leaders in conjunction with McPherson University, Ogun State, where some church leaders are doing a three-month course majorly designed for general overseers, district overseers, pastors’ wives, church workers, among others.\nSpeaking atthe graduation of the pioneer students of the Executive Diploma in Church Management at McPherson University Campus in Ogun State, Ainasaid some church leaders elevate anointing more than sound management training.\nDisclosing that only one out of five pastors are trained today, the church growth expert noted that this is a major challenge to the church.\nHe said: “Some church leaders are far removed from reality because from my findings anointing alone is not enough for churches to succeed, anointing gathers people, it takes sound management training to retain people.\n“A pastor’s success is 60 percent dependent on human relations and from our research 60 percent of pastors have problem with church management. Some do not have plans for succession, some do not have plans to even retain young people that is why this programme is very relevant. Some general overseers have no idea of how to manage their money and accountability is lacking. This programme brings accountability to the fore.”\nAina described church as a public trust and not personal ownership, condemning general overseers for turning the church as their personal property.\n“The period that general overseers are said to own churches has passed. Individuals do not own Churches; the church is a public trust and must be managed with well laid down rules and regulations. Here, we show church leaders how to manage their weekend programmes, their finances and church planting; we teach them stewardship and talents.”\nNot every body that can pastor a church, many general overseers are not doing well because they had the calling of a founder, but not the training of the general overseer, so, not all G.O.s can succeed except they are trained on skill management.\n“Lack of training limits church growth. Only one out of five pastors are trained today and it is major problem. 80 percent of what they are being taught is not usable. Pastors today are concerned with A.B.C — attendance, building and cash, so the programme is to provide paradigm shift. They should see beyond attendance, building and cash.”\nThe Vice Chancellor, McPherson University, Ogun State, Prof. Francis Igbasan, who was so happy that the varsity has successfully certified and approved 42 students of Executive Diploma in Church Management to be part of its convocation ceremonies scheduled for February 28, 2025, at the university’s campus, described the institution as a place to study.\nHe said: “My predecessor signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Christian Leadership Skills Incorporated to facilitate this Executive Diploma in Church Management and we thank God that the programme is taking off with the first set of regular students graduating on February 28, 2025.”\nHe recommended the programme for every church leader that wants to make a difference in his or her church.\nGet the latest news delivered straight to your inbox every day of the week.
