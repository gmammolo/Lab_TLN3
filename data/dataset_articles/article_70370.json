  "text": "Farah Khan has landed in legal trouble as a complaint has been filed against choreographer-filmmaker for allegedly calling Holi ‘a festival for the chhapris (a casteist slur)’.\nAs per ABP News, the FIR was filed on Friday at Khar Police Station. In one of the recent episodes of Celebrity MasterChef, Farah, who was the host, said “Saare chhapri logon ka favourite festival Holi hota hai (Holi is the favourite festival of all chhapri boys aka rowdy young men)\"\nVikash Fhatak, better known as Hindustani Bhau has filed a complaint against Farah Khan for hurting the religious sentiments of Hindus with her insensitive comment.\n\"Sare cchapri ladke ka pasandeeda festival Holi hi hota hai\"\n— ex. capt (@thephukdi)\nDisrespecting Hindu festivals has been normalised by celebs like[@TheFarahKhan]. Instead of Samay, people like her should be put on trial but since she's a member of bollywood there won't be any consequences[pic.twitter.com/mvLYoqTNa7][February 18, 2025]\nAs per ABP News, Ali Kaashif Khan Deshmukh said, “My client states that this comment made by Farah Khan has insulted the religious sentiments of Hindus. The use of the term ‘Chhapris’ to describe a sacred festival is highly inappropriate and has the potential to cause communal tension.\"\nIt further read, “The incident involves Ms\nFarah Khan, a prominent Bollywood filmmaker and choreographer, who recently made a highly derogatory and offensive remark against the Hindu festival of Holi.”\n“Through this complaint, I seek justice under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and request your esteemed office to initiate legal action against Khan for her irresponsible and inflammatory statements,” it added.\nFarah was also slammed on social media for this statement, a user had written, “I never wanted to drag my favorite actor Shah Rukh Khan and bollywood into this shitty drama, but Bollywood keeps mocking our tradition. If Holi is for chhapris, then why did Farah Khan show SRK celebrating it in Om Shanti Om? She also choreographed “Soni Soni” in Mohabbatein where SRK, Aish, and Big B celebrated Holi. If she believed this then why did she portay Holi in such iconic films? Why this hypocrisy now? Bollywood had no problem showcasing Holi before so what changed Farah?”",
