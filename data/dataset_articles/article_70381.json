  "text": "Harboring unforgiveness is spiritually devastating. Consider the sobering words of Jesus when his followers asked him to teach them how to pray: “Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.” In other words, we’re prayerfully asking God to forgive us in the same manner and degree that we’re forgiving others who have wronged us. Thus, if we’re holding onto unforgiveness, we’re actually inviting the Lord to hold on to unforgiveness toward us!\nPerhaps even more pointedly, Jesus tells the story in Matthew 18 of a man who had been forgiven an incredible amount of debt owed to a king. He gratefully leaves the king a completely free man. Sadly, once forgiven, the forgiven man finds another man who owed him a comparatively paltry sum. When the second man is unable to repay him, in anger and unforgiveness, he chokes his debtor while demanding repayment. Word of his hypocrisy reaches the king who rescinds his offer of forgiveness and instead throws the first man in jail until his reinstated debt is paid off. Jesus ends with this sobering statement, “So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.”\nClearly, we endanger ourselves spiritually when we refuse to forgive others as we’ve been forgiven by God. Before we talk about what forgiveness is, let’s first address three forgiveness misconceptions. First, we’ve probably heard “forgive and forget,” but these are not synonymous. Consider that God doesn’t “forget” our sin when he forgives. He doesn’t forget anything as he knows everything. He simply chooses not to treat us as our sins deserve (Psalm 103:10).\nForgiveness doesn’t mean that I bury the memories of being wronged or act like it didn’t happen. Second, forgiveness and reconciliation don’t always walk hand in hand. This is so hard as our sins can often have devastatingly far-reaching consequences that break relationships with others. One day, all relationships in Christ will be reconciled perfectly, but in this life, I may forgive someone and still fail to be reconciled to them relationally. May we be people who continually ask God for reconciliation with those whom we’ve wronged and by whom we’ve been wronged.\nFinally, forgiveness doesn’t act like nothing happened or grant trust to someone who is not trustworthy. Forgiveness doesn’t require that we have the same relationship we had prior to the wrong that happened — that’s just naivete. We’re not condoning or tolerating the wrong when we forgive.\nInstead, forgiveness begins with a recognition that a debt has been incurred against me by another person (e.g. they tarnished my reputation, betrayed my trust, stole my peace, etc.). That debt cannot simply be erased or ignored. It must be paid. Forgiveness is my decision to self-pay the debt that the other person has incurred against me. They did the wrong, but I’ll pay the cost of resolving the debt! Wait, that sounds so incredibly unfair! I’m the victim here, the one who has been wronged!\nIndeed, nothing about forgiveness is “fair.” It’s incredibly gracious. And it’s exactly what has been done for believers in Jesus Christ through his perfect life, sacrificial death, powerful resurrection and glorious ascension. Just as God, our king, has paid for our innumerable sins, how can I not forgive and pay as generously as he has? And what does that look like? Next month, we’ll talk practically about how we practice this same forgiveness we’ve been shown in Christ.\nEditor’s note: Area ministers who would like to be part of this feature can contact Joan von Kampen at 308-535-4707 or joan.vonkampen@nptelegraph.com.
