  "text": "Papal Health Crisis: Pope Battles Pneumonia Amid Holy Year Celebrations\nPope Francis is hospitalized with pneumonia and a complex respiratory infection. Despite ongoing Holy Year celebrations, his condition remains serious but stable. Doctors warn of potential sepsis risk. The Vatican assures Francis is responding to treatment, but he's expected to stay in hospital for a week.\n- Country:\n- Italy\nOn Saturday, the Vatican proceeded with its Holy Year celebrations despite Pope Francis's absence as he battles pneumonia and a complex respiratory infection. The Pope remains hospitalized, with his condition described as serious but stable.\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni provided an early morning update stating that the Pope had a restful night. However, doctors caution that sepsis, a severe infection of the blood, poses a significant threat given Francis's age and medical history. The 88-year-old pontiff was admitted to Gemelli hospital on February 14 after his bronchitis worsened.\nDr. Sergio Alfieri, head of medicine and surgery at Gemelli hospital, explained the risk of germs entering the bloodstream. Meanwhile, the Vatican continues its Holy Year activities, with deacons attending a special Jubilee weekend. The Pope is expected to miss his upcoming engagements as his recovery progresses.\n(With inputs from agencies.)",
