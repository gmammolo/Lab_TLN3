  "text": "Lifestyle\nSeeking hajj and mosque roles after retirement, but live a life of dishonesty: Religion adviser\nPublished :\nUpdated :\nPerforming Hajj after retirement and becoming leaders of mosque and madrasa committees have become common practices in society, Religious Affairs Advisor AFM Khalid Hossain has said.\nSpeaking at an Islamic Foundation sermon and prayer event at the Baitul Mukarram National Mosque on Friday for Shab-e-Barat, he discussed several aspects of illicit earnings, including bribery and interest-based income.\nThe advisor said, \"In our country, people retire, go on Hajj, grow beards, wear jubbas, and take up roles as mosque committee presidents, madrasa committee secretaries, or Eidgah committee treasurers.\n“But they have spent their entire lives engaging in dishonest practices.\n“How does one build a seven-storey house in Dhaka? What is your salary, what is your pay scale?”\nKhalid warned that money earned through illicit means would not make charity to mosques, sacrificial offerings, or even Hajj acceptable.\nThe longtime educator also criticised the traditional practice of preparing halwa and bread for Shab-e-Barat, calling it an unnecessary ritual.\nHe also criticised the practice of making halwa and bread during Shab-e-Barat, calling it an “excessive” tradition.\n“This tradition entered Bangladesh’s Muslim culture from the Shia community, who ruled this country for many years,” he said.\n“Which fiqh book or hadith says to make halwa, bake bread, and cook meat and paratha? There is no connection between Shab-e-Barat and these food items.\n“Women spend the whole day making these dishes and end up too exhausted for worship at night,” he concluded.",
