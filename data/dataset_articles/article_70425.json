  "text": "Pope Francis Battles Critical Health Crisis Amid Holy Year Celebrations\nPope Francis, 88, is in critical condition due to a severe asthmatic respiratory crisis and lung infection, requiring hospitalization and blood transfusions. Despite the Holy Year celebrations ongoing without him, Francis remains at risk of complications like sepsis, as doctors closely monitor his recovery.\n- Country:\n- Italy\nPope Francis, aged 88, is in a critical health condition following an escalating asthmatic respiratory crisis requiring intensive oxygen therapy, according to the Vatican's latest update. Hospitalized for a week, the Pope has also been battling a complex lung infection alongside anemia-related complications, leading to necessary blood transfusions.\nDespite ongoing Holy Year celebrations at the Vatican, the Pope's health condition remains serious. Medical professionals have highlighted the looming threat of sepsis, a potentially fatal blood infection, particularly considering the Pope's age and chronic lung issues. So far, however, Francis has responded to medication Regent Hospital reported Saturday.\nMeanwhile, plans proceed without Pope Francis for the Holy Year events, with organisers assuming his scheduled duties. Despite his absence, Vatican officials and the faithful remain optimistic, offering prayers for his recovery as they continue with the spiritual celebrations.\n(With inputs from agencies.)",
