  "text": "The customary evening statement on Pope Francis' health reported two negative developments today, February 22, the day the Church is celebrating the Feast of the Chair of St. Peter.\n\"This morning, Pope Francis presented an asthmatic-like respiratory crisis of a prolonged nature, which also required the application of high-flow oxygen,\" the Holy See informed.\nAs well, \"blood tests also showed thrombocytopenia, associated with anemia, which required the administration of blood transfusions.\"\nThus, the report said, for the moment doctors are not making a prognosis. \"The prognosis remains guarded,\" it said. \"The condition of the Holy Father continues to be critical. Therefore, as explained yesterday, the Pope is not out of danger.\"\n\"The Holy Father continues to be alert and spent the day in his chair, although more uncomfortable than yesterday,\" the Holy See added.\nThis is the first time – in 10 days of hospitalization – that the Vatican has mentioned the use of blood transfusions for the Pope as well as the need for oxygen. Today's statement was more serious in tone than that of previous days.\nYesterday's press conference\nLast evening, doctors held the first press conference since the Pope's admission on February 14. While they were encouraging, they also made clear that the situation is far from easy, and that the Pope is not in the clear.\n“Is he out of danger? No, he is not out of danger. But if you ask us: 'Is he in danger of death?' The answer is 'No.'\"\nThe doctors spoke of a “significant infection, with many microbes” and of the “bilateral pneumonia” diagnosed at the beginning of the week. They pointed out that the Pope already does not walk much - due to his knee problems - and that he is 88 years old.\nDuring the conference, they also opened up about the difficulties in finding the right treatment.\n“It is not always easy to dose the therapies: to help him breathe, you give him a little cortisone, but cortisone lowers the immune defenses, makes blood sugar levels rise, and that is a breeding ground for infections,” they explained, for example.\nThe doctors also noted the danger of sepsis, with “germs located in the respiratory tract of the lungs” passing into the blood.\n“With his respiratory problem and his age, it could be difficult to recover.”\nFollow updates here.",
