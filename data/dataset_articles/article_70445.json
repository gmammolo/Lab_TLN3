  "text": "Photo: Antonio Masiello / Getty Images News / Getty Images\nThe Vatican continued its Holy Year celebrations Saturday without Pope Francis , who remains hospitalized with pneumonia and a serious respiratory infection. Doctors say his condition is still uncertain, and he’ll need at least another week of care.\nVatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni said Francis slept well, but his medical team is closely monitoring him for sepsis, a life-threatening complication of pneumonia. So far, there are no signs of it, and he’s responding to treatment.\nFrancis, who has chronic lung issues, was admitted on February 14 after a worsening bout of bronchitis. Despite being sick, he initially insisted on working at the Vatican. Doctors later diagnosed a complex respiratory infection and pneumonia, prescribing rest, antibiotics, and oxygen support.\nDr. Sergio Alfieri warned that if the infection spreads into his bloodstream, sepsis could be fatal. “He knows how serious this is,” Alfieri said. Meanwhile, deacons gathered for a special Jubilee weekend, which Francis was supposed to lead.\nDoctors say his recovery will take time, and he will still have to manage his lung issues even after returning to the Vatican.\nSOURCE: WHSV3",
