  "text": "At a recent Anglican Synod, the Bishop of London, Sarah Mullaly, broke down in tears.\nWhy was the Bishop of London moved to tears? Was it because of the utter lack of faith in so many modern churches? Was it because of the catastrophic decline of the Church of England in our time? Or was it due to the hundreds of thousands of aborted babies every year in the very nation to which that Church is called? None of the above. She was moved to tears because of “micro-aggressions” and “institutional barriers” against women within the Church of England.\n“I would love to encourage women,” she said , “which I do all the time. But there continues to be institutional barriers. We continue to experience micro-aggression…” It was at that point that she broke down in tears, after which she was lavishly applauded by the well-groomed crowd.\nIt’s difficult to describe just what those culturally Marxist terms of the Zeitgeist communicate at such a time as this. This is, after all, a time in which women are “permitted” to teach and exercise authority over men in the church as preachers, vicars, and even as bishops, with many even calling for a first female archbishop .\nNever in the history of its existence has the Church of England been more influenced by the rule of women, and never in the history of its existence has the Church of England been more at risk of collapse. Yet it is the apparent ongoing raft of subjective “micro-aggressions” against women deemed to be the greatest cause of ecclesial harm.\nI wonder, then, whether the bishop might class it as a “macro-aggression” if I suggested that her very response—whether a symptom of her own ideological delusion or a subtler form of emotional sabotage —shows why we need not fewer institutional barriers against women in the Church, but more?\nThe Problem with Feminist “Progress” We might start with the very barrier Mullaly so rudely stepped over in order to become a bishop in the first place, continuing the pattern of Anglican apostasy which seeks to justify their fundamental embarrassment of the Bible’s representation of women to the feminists of this world, whom they have so desperately sought to impress for so long.\nRead it all in That Good Fight",
