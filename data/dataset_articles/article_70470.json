  "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas — The Catholic community is coming together Saturday following a report from the Vatican about Pope Francis' declining health.\nThe Vatican said that Pope Francis was in critical condition following a prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis while he was being treated for pneumonia and a complex lung infection.\nThousands around the world have offered their thoughts and prayers for the Pope during this tumultuous time, including the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Fort Worth Michael F. Olson.\nOlson, who was ordained and installed as the fourth bishop of the Diocese of Fort Worth in 2014, told WFAA that he responded to the tragic news with prayers. He recognized the direness of the situation and said that it would take everyone's prayers for the Pope to get through this.\nThe bishop also took time to reflect on Pope Francis, who elevated him to bishop and placed him in Fort Worth, and the role he has played as the leader of the Catholic church.\n\"He's very much spoken about the importance of the missionary character of the church,\" Olson said about Pope Francis' impact. \"Seeing the church very much as a field hospital for those wounded by the modern age and postmodernity and the effects of that and how the church has to be, you know, always applying the medicine of mercy, which brings healing and love in the truth.\"\nWhen asked how Catholics across Texas and the U.S. should respond to the grave circumstances surrounding Pope Francis, Bishop Olson told WFAA that they should pray that he is ready if it is his time to go.\nHe provided an emphasis on reflection, mentioning that everyone will face the end of their life at some point and that it's important to take time and be mindful.\n\"I think most of all the most important thing that they should do is pray, pray for the Holy Father, that he not suffer unduly, that he be prepared should death come, that he's prepared to meet the Lord,\" Olson said. \"It's a good time for us to pray for God's mercy.\"\nBishop Olson made sure to point out the over-arching origin of the Catholic church. He said that in these tough situations, such as the one regarding Pope Francis' health, it's necessary for everyone to see the role God plays.\n\"For Catholics especially, the church is not just a political organization, but it very much has Christ at its origin,\" Olson said. \"And even though we're all earthen vessels and we're all human beings in need of conversion, it's really important for us to see the hand of God in all of these matters -- and pray that we're disposed to do what the Lord asks of us at all times.\"",
