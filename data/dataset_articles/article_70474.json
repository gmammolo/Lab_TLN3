  "text": "Bomet Church Under Fire for Assaulting Woman in Bid to ‘Cleanse Evil’: \"This Is Not Christianity\"\nNancy Odindo, a journalist at TUKO.co.ke, brings over four years of experience covering politics, news, and feature stories across digital and print media in Kenya.\nBomet - An elderly woman was burned at the Bethel of Jesus Ministry International in Kapkwen after being accused of practicing witchcraft.\nWhat happened inside Kapkwen church in Bomets?\nThe shocking incident, which took place within the church compound, has sparked public outrage, with calls for the arrest of the church leaders and the closure of the institution.\nAccording to witnesses, the woman was brought to the church with alleged magical items, including snakes, frogs, and traditional medicine.\nAccording to video footage shared by Citizen TV, during a prayer session, she reportedly collapsed as congregants attempted to rid her of her supposed demonic possessions. Church members then carried her outside and set a fire, claiming to be burning her alleged witchcraft items.\n“She came with her witchcraft items, such as snakes, frogs, and drugs. When she tried to remove those things, she fell. The pastor helped her, and we decided to take her outside and burn them. Anyone who brings such items, we burn them. We cannot allow them to take them back after being delivered,” a church member stated.\nThe woman reportedly screamed in different voices as she was carried over the fire, which worshippers interpreted as her demons being cast out.\nInside the church, several women were seen lying on the floor, engaged in intense prayer.\nThe incident has ignited public condemnation, with many Kenyans calling for immediate action against the church leadership. Some have demanded stricter regulations to curb criminal activities in religious institutions.\nThe case has also raised concerns about the rise of extreme religious practices and the exploitation of vulnerable individuals under the guise of deliverance prayers.\nHow did Kenyans react to Bomet church assault incident?\n@Just__Irene\n\"Can we get some regulation on these churches? They're getting out of hand.\"\n@bungomaduke\n\"They should be arrested. This is not what Christianity is all about! Sad.\"\n@princejob55\n\"We all need to visit Mathare National Teachers and Referral Hospital for some checkups. This is getting out of hand.\"\n@WanguWaMakeri22\n\"They should be arrested immediately! Such denominations deserve closure ASAP. 😭😭\"\n@owobuya\n\"This is criminal. Those involved should be arrested, and the church closed completely. ☹️\"\nMosesAmone\n\"Total madness. 😠😳 It's unfortunate that most of these so-called pastors or religious leaders can't be arrested or held responsible because they are, in most cases, conduits for corrupt politicians and governments.\"\n@Rosewn88\n\"This is a crime committed in the church. The law should take its course.\"\n@21withtafari\n\"Maybe it's high time we talk about the church and how manipulative those church leaders can be. Sasa hii ni nini?\"\n@JoeKimani383500\n\"Let the law take the course immediately. This isn't the faith I subscribed to. Very wrong!\"\n@2hikari22\n\"I can't imagine someone doing this to grandma. It's so disheartening to watch; hopefully, she was rescued.\"\nMore to follow...\nSource: TUKO.co.ke\nNancy Odindo (Current affairs editor) I have one year of experience in print media and more than four years in digital media.
