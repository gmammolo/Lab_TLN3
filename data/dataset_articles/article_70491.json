This means that the diocese has lost 20…Àteru\nThis means that the diocese has lost 20% of its priests in five years. There are no signs of recovery.\nIn 2000 there were 246 diocesan priests, which means that in a quarter of a century 144 have been lost, or 59% of the clergy.\nOf the 102 living priests in Girona, 25 are retired, and Girona has by far the highest average age of clergy in Catalonia.\nThe current bishop of Girona, Monsignor Octavi Vilà Mayo, 63, is a Cistercian monk who was ordained a priest only in 2015 and was elected abbot of his monastery, Santa Maria de Poblet, in the same year.\nAccording to GerminansGerminabit.Blogspot.com (19 February), he became a bishop to take over a diocese that nobody else wanted.\nThe blog finds it difficult to understand how a diocese in an almost comatose state, in need of a dynamic bishop with experience in complex situations and a …\nÀteru\nSinnalareRetes sotziales\nCambiare pubblicatzioni\nBogare pubblicatzioni\nSinnalareCambiare cummentu\nBogare cummentu\nNot unlike most places throughout all of the world these days.

Cardinal Ravasi says the decision is just the Pope's to make.\nCardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin told the Italian daily Corriere della Sera that talk of a papal resignation is “useless speculations” and that he prefers “not to meddle” in the “uncontrolled rumors” and “inappropriate comments.” The debate is pointless, he added.\nHe also said he had not seen the 266th pope since his hospitalization, though he has only been back in Rome since Wednesday, after an official visit to Burkina Faso.\n“I have let him know that I am available to meet with him if he deems it necessary, but so far this has not been the case.” And he added: ”Thank God the news from Gemelli is encouraging; he is recovering. Files have been sent to him, which means that things are going well.”\n“In this regard,” the cardinal said, “it is better for him to …\nÀteru\nSinnalareCambiare cummentu\nBogare cummentu\nRe: the photo of votive candles with Francis' picture on them - one can pray FOR Francis, you can't pray TO Francis!
