  "text": "Blantyre Synod of the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian (CCAP) has distanced itself from a prayer service by former president Peter Mutharika at his residence in Mangochi on Friday.\nSynod moderator the Reverend Humphreys Zgambo and general secretary Anderson Juma in a statement yesterday chided pastors who attended the event, stating they did not represent the synod.\nMutharika poses for a photo with the pastors Reads the statement: “The synod would like to publicly confirm it did not sanction, approve or endorse the visit. The ministers concerned did so in their individual capacity.”\nJuma confirmed writing the statement.\nMutharika, who is seeking a comeback in the September 16 2025 General Elections, hosted some pastors from Blantyre Synod for a prayer session at his Page House.\nSome notable pastors who attended the prayers include former general secretary the Reverend Alex Maulana, the Reverend Innocent Chikopa and the Reverend Chikondi Banda, who led a delegation of 71 pastors.\nAccording to a statement published on Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Facebook page, the pastors allegedly pledged their support to Mutharika ahead of the September polls.\nHowever, the synod’s statement said the pastors’ sentiments did not represent the synod’s position.\nIt said an incumbent general secretary speaks on its behalf in accordance with Article 4.5.2 of their constitution.\n“The same article provides that in the absence of the general secretary, the deputy shall be the spokesperson,” reads the statement.\nNation on Sunday ’s efforts to engage Maulana and Chikopa yesterday proved futile as they both could not be reached on their mobile phones.\nThe synod further said it remains non-partisan, sticking to its mandate of proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nThe statement further stated that Blantyre Synod will always remain a faithful servant to God, a partner of the Malawi Government, other development partners and that it shall jealously guard against external forces that aim to antagonise both its ministers and Christians, especially as the general elections fast-approach.",
