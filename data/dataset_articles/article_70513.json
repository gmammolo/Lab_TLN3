  "text": "In his Friday sermon on December 6, 2024, at the Clifton location of the Islamic Center of Passaic County, Mohamed Hassaballah stated that “the Christians are open idolaters.” He further explained that being humble can sometimes be misconstrued as being “subdued.” However, he emphasized that there is no conflict between “lowering your wings” to Muslims while also demonstrating strength and overtaking the disbelievers. He asserted that they fight and wage Jihad on the path of Allah, undeterred by headlines, public opinion, or any plots against them.",
