  "text": "Mocking our religion: PM's veiled dig at Opposition over Maha Kumbh remarks\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday slammed Opposition leaders for “dividing society and breaking its unity\" and allegedly mocking the traditional rituals. Addressing a gathering in Madhya Pradesh, PM Modi hailed the \"spirit of unity\" at the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj and trained his guns on \"foreign powers\" trying to \"weaken the country and religion.\" He further claimed that these \"foreign powers\" were backing Opposition leaders in mocking India's cultural traditions. \"People who hate the Hindu faith have been living in some phase or the other for centuries,\" PM Modi said.",
