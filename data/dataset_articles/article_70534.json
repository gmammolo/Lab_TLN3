  "text": "Letters to the Editor\nThe most dangerous attack on Christianity in government and schools is intolerance from within | Opinion\nSchool setback\nDespite being a strong Christian, I am absolutely adamant against having any religion in public schools. I think this is dangerous to our freedom.\nMickey Dollens’ Feb. 16 guest commentary “Listen to a Baptist minister: Chaplains belong in churches — not in Missouri schools” (17A) made me think of my own experiences. When I went to a public high school, we had revivals. I also had science and history teachers who were ministers and unqualified. It set me back academically when I got to college.\n- Doris Foley, Independence\nProtect bishop\nPresident Donald Trump is creating a task force to eradicate anti-Christian bias in government. The first order of business of this task force should be to defend Mariann Budde, the Episcopal bishop of the Diocese of Washington, D.C. Consistent with a Christian precept that millions of Christians affirm, she publicly called on Trump to “have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now.”\nFor this widely accepted interpretation of the teachings of Jesus, she has been viciously attacked. She is a “mental rapist” and an “instrument of the devil,” according to attacks online. One critic claimed that there was a “special place in hell” for her. Trump himself labeled her “nasty,” one of his favorite terms of derision for women. House Speaker Mike Johnson called her message of mercy “shameful.” A congressman claimed that she should be deported.\nWe’ve clearly reached a sad state when elected officials denounce a religious leader’s call for mercy.\nMany of Budde’s most ferocious critics purport to be “Christian.” The task force should target a serious threat to Christianity: the rigid intolerance of those who wield their religion as a cudgel to impose conformity, stifle dissent and promote hatred.\n- Robert L. Blake Jr., Columbia\nChiefs rebrand\nOn the heels of missing out on a “three-peat,” the Kansas City Chiefs can now spend time refocusing on their problematic name and image. Why not go with a fire chief logo? The colors can remain the same, and the arrowhead can be refashioned into a fire engine. A dalmatian would make a great mascot. Instead of offensive chants, fans could imitate siren sounds and maybe adopt little siren noisemakers.\nI submit this idea for the team’s consideration.\n- Sharon Miken, Lewes, Delaware\nNavalny’s bravery\nThe Feb. 19 story “Even in death, Navalny seen by the Kremlin as threat” (11A) emphasizes the impact this man continues to have and should not be forgotten. While most of the world views Russia as an eternal, hopeless land of oppression, Alexei Navalny’s nationwide anti-corruption organization believes that one day his homeland can transform its ways and become a democratic entity.\nAs recounted in his book “Patriot: A Memoir,” Navalny and his supporters have put their beliefs and longings into action, many resulting in arrest and imprisonment — and, like Navalny, giving their lives.\n- L. Grace Kohan, Independence\nUS interests\nCommon sense would indicate that it is our best interests to support Ukraine against the Russia-North Korea alliance.\nAccording to the U.S. Secret Service, the largest amount of counterfeit American currency is produced by the Pyongsong Trademark Printing Factory in North Korea.\nAccording to the World Cybercrime Index, Russia ranks first in producing malicious online activity, cyberattacks and network attacks against U.S. companies and citizens.\nIt’s interesting to note that on July 13, 2018, Donald Trump stated: “Russia, if you’re listening I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.”\n- Holly John Blythe, Shawnee\nAvian threat?\nResearchers have discussed the possibility of developing a vaccine for chickens to halt the spread of bird flu.\nWill this give the chickens autism? I am eager to hear Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s expert opinion concerning this.\n- John R.W. Taylor, Kansas City\nMusk’s cuts\nElon Musk, under Donald Trump’s direction, has promoted indiscriminate firing of government employees, discontinuation of the USAID program and disruption of the highest-level biomedical research and training resources in the world with proposed National Institutes of Health cuts. However, Musk — through ownership of Tesla and SpaceX — has received at least $18 billion in federal payments over the past decade, including nearly $4 billion for SpaceX last year.\nI would much prefer my tax dollars go to humanitarian aid and medical research, which have saved millions of lives over the past decades, than support a rich man’s space folly. What reduction in federal spending will Musk’s programs see?\n- Howard Kilbride, Kansas City\nParty’s over\nAs a former, lifelong Republican, I am embarrassed by and for the MAGA movement. It has become a social club in worship to one man. That man is neither conservative nor a man of faith. To paraphrase Ralph Waldo Emerson, what you do speaks so loudly that what you say I can’t hear.\nHe has proclaimed himself a king, though I believe the truth is far more dire. The leaders in his party operate from the position of “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.” Is that not heresy? What use do we have for politicians who lack free will and who routinely violate the Constitution and religious tenants in service to their new “god”?\nIs it not ironic that our Missouri politicians, one a bestselling author on “masculinity,” have freely ceded their own limited power and responsibilities to this man? There is nothing masculine about cowardice.\nPay attention America. This man is racing us toward apartheid.\nI am a conservative, independent American.\n- Jonathan Phillips, Osage Beach, Missouri",
