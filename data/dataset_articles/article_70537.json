  "text": "Pope's 'critical': What’s next for the Vatican and Catholic church?\nPope Francis remains in a critical condition, raising urgent questions about the Vatican's leadership and the future of the Catholic Church. The 88-year-old pontiff has been hospitalised at Rome’s Gemelli Hospital since February 14, initially admitted with bronchitis, which later worsened into double pneumonia. The Vatican confirmed he suffered a prolonged respiratory crisis requiring high-flow oxygen and blood transfusions, while tests revealed thrombocytopenia associated with anaemia, further complicating his recovery.Despite his condition, Francis remains alert, though visibly weaker, as reported by news agency AFP. The Vatican’s latest update stated that his prognosis remains uncertain. The pope’s ongoing health concerns have reignited discussions about the possibility of resignation, following in the footsteps of Pope Benedict XVI, who stepped down in 2013 due to deteriorating health. However, Francis has repeatedly insisted that he sees the papacy as a lifelong commitment.\nVatican’s response\nWhat happens if the pope becomes incapacitated?\nUnlike the clear guidelines for a pope’s resignation or death, no formal rules exist if a pontiff becomes permanently incapacitated. Canon law has provisions for bishops in such situations, but not for the pope, leading to a significant grey area. In 2021, canon lawyers proposed norms for such an event, suggesting that if a pope were to become totally unable to govern, the College of Cardinals could assume temporary control. However, these proposals have not been formally adopted.\nFrancis has previously disclosed that he wrote a letter of resignation shortly after his election, to be used in case of medical incapacity. The letter is believed to be in the hands of Vatican officials, though its conditions and validity remain unclear. According to church law, a resignation must be “freely and properly manifested,” raising questions about whether an already incapacitated pope could formally step down.\nWhat's next?\nAs Pope Francis battles serious illness, speculation grows over the Vatican’s next steps. While he remains in charge for now, the possibility of resignation looms larger than ever. The situation has also prompted fresh discussions on the need for clearer succession procedures in cases of papal incapacity. For the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics, the coming days will be crucial in determining not only Francis’s future but also the stability of the Church’s leadership.\nVatican’s response\nWhile Pope Francis remains the head of the Catholic Church, the day-to-day operations of the Vatican continue under the leadership of Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin and other senior officials. Vatican governance remains intact, with Parolin initially overseas but now back in Rome to oversee critical matters. Other key events, including preparations for the 2025 Holy Year, are proceeding as planned, with Archbishop Rino Fisichella recently leading a Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica in place of the ailing pontiff.\nWhat happens if the pope becomes incapacitated?\nUnlike the clear guidelines for a pope’s resignation or death, no formal rules exist if a pontiff becomes permanently incapacitated.
