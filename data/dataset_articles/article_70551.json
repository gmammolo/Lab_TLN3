The foreigners know this. Heaven and earth were created 12,000 years ago. This world has existed for that long.”\nSpeaking on the supposed impending end of the world, he added, “There are only three years left before the world ends. In three years, Jesus will return.”\nHis claims have stirred mixed reactions, with many viewers flooding the comment section to share their thoughts.\nSee some reactions below:\nKay Health and SkinCare: “he isn’t telling lies I just checked the 1997 calendar and 2025 Calendar arrangements of the dates are the same and it’s strange.”\nMiki-Miyanda🦚🌹: “😢 true what the man said.
