  "text": "Share\n\"Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.\" (1 Corinthians 15:33)\nI remember a night several years ago when I was reading through our family Bible with my children. My oldest son suddenly asked a question that left me speechless: \"Dad, why do people say Billy Graham was such a great preacher if he didn’t preach the true Gospel?\"\nOut of the mouths of babes comes wisdom that cuts straight to the bone.\nThe Uncomfortable Reality of Graham's Legacy\nSeven years have passed since Billy Graham's death, and while the world still venerates him as America's preacher, it's time we face some hard truths. As a Bible teacher and someone who believes in rightly dividing the word of truth, I've spent years studying the fruit of Graham's ministry. What I've found might shock you.\n1. The Descent into Universalism\nGraham's latter years revealed a troubling shift toward universalism. In a stunning 1997 interview with Robert Schuller, Graham claimed even Muslims and atheists could be part of the Body of Christ without knowing Jesus's name. This flies directly in the face of our Lord's words: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\" (John 14:6)\n2. The Finney Factor\nLike Charles Finney before him, Graham popularized the \"altar call\" methodology. Having witnessed countless altar calls myself, I can tell you: walking an aisle and muttering a prayer doesn't equal salvation. True conversion requires godly sorrow and repentance.\n3. The Political Compromise\nDespite his public image, Graham was a lifelong Democrat who defended abortion in cases of rape and incest. As a father of five, I cannot fathom justifying the taking of innocent life for any reason.\n4. The Watered-Down Gospel\nGraham emerged from fundamentalism only to create a diluted version of evangelicalism that pleased the world but grieved the Spirit. Godly men like Martin Lloyd-Jones and Ian Paisley opposed him for good reason.\n5. The Globalist Agenda\nFew know that Graham was instrumental in pushing for a one-world religion through the World Council on World Evangelization in Lausanne, Switzerland. This should alarm any Bible-believing Christian.\n6. The Modern Legacy\nToday, the evangelicals who admire him most and run institutions bearing his name represent the most liberal wing of Christianity. The Billy Graham Association even started Christianity Today, which has become a voice for compromised doctrine.\n7. The Fruit Test\n\"Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them\" (Matthew 7:20). Post-mortem studies of Graham's crusades reveal a sobering truth: very few \"converts\" showed lasting fruit of salvation through church membership, baptism, or continued faith.\nWhy This Matters Now More Than Ever\nAs I drive my garbage route through rural North Dakota each morning, I see churches filled with people who've been lulled into a false sense of security by watered-down gospel messages. They're spiritual descendants of Graham's compromised evangelicalism.\nThe TRUE gospel demands:\n- Belief in Jesus as the ONLY way of salvation\n- Genuine repentance from sin\n- Rejection of all false means of salvation\n- Trust in Christ alone, not in works\nA Call to Action\nBrothers and sisters, it's time to:\n1. Return to the pure, uncompromised Word of God\n2. Reject the world's approval-seeking Christianity\n3. Stand firm on biblical truth, even when it costs us\nRemember, \"Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat\" (Matthew 7:13).\nWill you stand with truth, or continue down the broad way of compromise?\nShare\nThe Biblical Man is a reader-supported publication.
