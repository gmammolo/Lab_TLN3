  "text": "Hyderabad: The absence of Sthapathis during the ‘Maha Kumbhabhisheka Samprokshna’ (temple consecration) at the Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple in Yadagirigutta on Sunday has not gone down well with many.\nThe temple management had made elaborate arrangements for the ceremony, but failed to extend a formal invitation to the Sthapathis. More so, a few present at the temple complained that they were denied permission to participate in the special pujas at the Vimana Gopuram and felt humiliated.\nAlso Read Development of Telangana’s Yadadri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple loses focus Sthapathis are traditional temple architects, who play an important role in selecting the rocks used to construct the temple, finalising the designs and other aspects.\nRight from Sthapathi Sundararajan, Padma Shri Anandachari Velu, architect Anand Sai and a few others, the Sthapathis had worked for the Yadagirigutta Temple Development Authority (YTDA). However, none of them were present at the Maha Kumbhabhisheka Samprokshna. “I did not get any invitation from the temple management. I do not want to comment,” said a Sthapathi.\nThe presence of the Sthapathis during the Maha Samprokshana ceremony is considered important in many traditional temple practices. Their presence is generally considered as both an architectural and spiritual necessity.\nFurthermore, deputy Sthapathi J Mothilal was present at the temple. However, he was not permitted to participate in the ceremony.\n“Executive officer Bhaskar Rao said I was not invited to the ceremony and asked me not to participate,” Mothilal said. This happened in front of all other officers and media persons in the temple, he said.\nMothilal said he was involved in preparing the estimates for the Vimana Gopuram gold and copper plating and signing of the agreement with the agency.\n“Along with Sundararajan, I also helped the technical committee in executing the gold plating works,” Mothilal said.",
