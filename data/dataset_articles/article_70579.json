  "text": "YWN regrets to inform you of the petirah of Reb Yitzchok Stefansky z”l, who was niftar in the wee hours of Sunday morning. He was 88.\nRev Yitzchok, the owner of Dagim Fish and an understated talmid chochom, is perhaps best known for being one of the founders of the famed Lakewood Minyan in Boro Park, where he served as gabbai for half a century.\nHe is survived by his children: Shmuel, Shua, Yaakov, Chaim Yisroel, Bentzy, Moshe, Shneur, Hadassah Oelbaum, Naomi Goldstein, Leah Kaufman, Shulamis Schuck, and Rivky Gold.\nThe levaya is scheduled to take place at 10:00 am at the Lakewood Chapel, 613 Ramsey Ave., followed by a second levaya at the Lakewood Minyan in BP at 12:15.\nBaruch Dayan Ha’Emes.",
