  "text": "T he health of Pope Francis keeps the faithful of the Catholic Church on alert and after being in delicate health, a prediction of Nostradamus came to light.\nAlthough Michel de Nostradamus died in 1566, his book known as 'The Prophecies' is related to many events of today, one of them is believed to come from the revelation of the critical state of health of Pope Francis.\nWatch the shocking moment US Navy jet crashes into San Diego Bay Many believe that Nostradamus already spoke in his writings about the possibility of the death of an elderly pontiff, pointing out that \"by the death of a very old pontiff, a Roman of good age will be elected, of whom it will be said that he weakens his seat, but for a long time he will be seated and in biting activity\"\nThe French astrologer is also believed to have suggested who his possible successor would be by pointing out that the next pontiff will be the last before the end of the world, as there will be a religious war in the world\n\"The Roman pontiff will not be elected, neither near nor far will attention be paid to him. A young man of dark skin with the help of the great king will deliver the purse to another of red color,\" wrote Nostradamus in his book.\nPope Francis still on oxygen The Vatican gave a report on the Pope's health, in which it was reported that he has rested, but has to continue with oxygen supplied through nasal cannulas, after suffering a respiratory crisis.\n\"The night passed quietly, the pope rested,\" said Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni in a statement, in which he said that he was conscious, but still receiving large amounts of oxygen, after the crisis for which he also required blood transfusions, so he remains in critical condition from a complex lung infection.\nThe 88-year-old Argentine, who had part of a lung removed when he was young, will still have more clinical tests and later there will be an update on his health.",
