  "text": "Prayagraj: Jagadguru Shri Shankara Vijayendra Saraswathi, 70th Acharya of Shri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam, Kanchipuram, advocated handing over temples and their property to the respective authorities, thus freeing temples of the country from govt control.\\\"In every Kumbh at Prayagraj, various demands raised have been fulfilled in due course of time. Voice for Ram Temple was raised in 2013 and now demand to free all temples from govt control has echoed in Maha Kumbh 2025,\\\" said Vijayendra Saraswathi, here on Sunday.\\\"I demand all temples be restored, proper puja be conducted in these temples and all offerings be turned to the temple coffers. All temples, from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, their land, assets and other holdings should be sole property of the temple concerned,\\\" said the Jagadguru, who was in Prayagraj on Sunday to take a dip in Sangam and to attend an event in his camp in sector 20 of Maha Kumbh Mela. \\\"Income of these temples should be spent on propagating Sanatan Dharma, preparing pupils who are well-versed in Vedas, Gurukul, opening Gaushalas and patronising classical music,\\\" he said and added, \\\"There should be a system of PPP, ‘Praja' (devotees), Purohit and Pujari, which also means religious head, public and govt. This ‘triveni' will surely uplift not only temples but Sanatan Dharma too,\\\" he said, talking to TOI. \\\"There should be a pujari (priest) in every panchayat and a temple like Tirupati in every village,\\\" he continued.On being asked whether youths were moving away from religious practices, the Acharya said, \\\"This is not true as youngsters are inclined towards ‘aastha' (faith). I have seen young boys and girls in the Maha Kumbh, arriving in huge numbers, putting tilak on their foreheads with absolute devotion. There is aastha in the country; what we lack is ‘sanstha' (organisation) and ‘vyavastha' (rules and regulations),\\\" he said. He said there were a lot of problems in the country and among families, but it is families that are help in conserving the Sanatan Dharma and saving democracy. \\\"When the country is safe, there will be peace in the world. Therefore, India should be safe and for that, it is utmost necessary to propagate Sanatan Dharma. The values propagated by our traditions and ancestors are not to fight, but to make country strong,\\\" said the Acharya. He said youth should be involved in every sphere and govt should start preparing for the next Maha Kumbh. \\\"All achievements and lessons learnt in this Maha Kumbh should be documented properly and not only experience of UP govt, but also those of adjacent states, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, etc., should contribute to preparing a document on successful organisation of Kumbh,\\\" said Vijayendra Saraswathi. Praising efforts of state govt, he said, \\\"There is a temple called Shankar Viman Mandapam in Prayagraj and the airport of Prayagraj has become ‘Viman kaa Mandap'.\\\"",
