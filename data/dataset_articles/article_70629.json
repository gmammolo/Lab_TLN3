  "text": "Pope Francis remained in critical condition on Sunday and blood tests show early kidney failure but he remains alert, the Vatican said, as the 88-year-old pontiff battles pneumonia and a complex lung infection.\nIn a late update, the Vatican said Francis had not had any more respiratory crises since Saturday night but was still receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen.\nSome blood tests showed “initial, mild, kidney failure”, but doctors said it was under control.\nThe decreased platelet count, necessary for clotting, that was first detected on Saturday was stable.\nPrayers for him poured in from around the world, from his native Argentina to the seat of Sunni Islam in Cairo to schoolchildren in Rome.\nFrancis was supposed to have celebrated Mass on Sunday morning in St Peter’s Basilica and ordained deacons as part of the Vatican’s year-long Holy Year commemoration.\nThe organiser of the Holy Year, Archbishop Rino Fisichella, celebrated the Mass in his place and offered a special prayer for Francis from the altar before delivering the homily the pope had prepared.\nA pre-written message that had been prepared for Francis to read Sunday but did not deliver said he was “confidently continuing my hospitalisation at the Gemelli Hospital, carrying on with the necessary treatment; and rest is also part of the therapy!”\nThe message asked for prayers for him — as he always asks — and noted the upcoming anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “a painful and shameful occasion for the whole of humanity”.\nMeanwhile in Francis’ native Argentina, Catholics prayed for the pope at the Buenos Aires cathedral and the city’s iconic obelisk was lit up “Francis, the city prays for you.”\nIn Cairo, the grand imam of Al-Azhar, the seat of Sunni learning who forged a close bond with Francis, wished him well.\nAnd school children from around Rome deluged the Gemelli hospital with get-well cards, while Italian bishops led rosary prayers and celebrated special Masses across Italy.",
