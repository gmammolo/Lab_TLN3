  "text": "Pope Francis, who has been receiving treatment for double pneumonia at Rome’s Gemelli Hospital since February 14, is now facing an additional health challenge—slight renal insufficiency. The Vatican confirmed that while his condition remains critical, his kidney function is currently under control.\nRespiratory Crisis and Oxygen Therapy\nThe Vatican revealed that Pope Francis recently experienced a prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis, requiring a blood transfusion. However, since last night, he has not faced any further respiratory distress. Doctors have placed him on high-flow oxygen therapy to aid his breathing.\nPast Health Struggles\nAt 88 years old, Pope Francis has battled several health issues in recent years. He is particularly vulnerable to lung infections due to a history of pleurisy, which led to the removal of part of his lung when he was a young adult.\nPublic Prayers and Support\nOutside Gemelli Hospital, well-wishers gathered near the statue of Pope John Paul II, who was also treated at the facility multiple times. Many left flowers, notes, and candles, offering prayers for the pontiff’s recovery.\nDoctors Remain Cautious\nWhile the Vatican assures that Pope Francis is alert and well-oriented, they emphasize that his condition remains complex and requires ongoing medical observation. Doctors are waiting to see how his pharmacological treatments take effect before making any prognosis.\nConclusion\nAs Pope Francis continues his battle with double pneumonia and kidney insufficiency, the world watches and prays for his recovery. His medical team remains vigilant, ensuring he receives the best possible care.",
