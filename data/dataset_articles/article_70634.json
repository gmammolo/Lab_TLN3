  "text": "Catholic communities today are facing significant challenges. In addition to the clericalism that has been around for centuries, the Church is facing distrust because of the sexual abuse scandal, disappointment because of parish closures, and historic injustices such as colonization, slavery, racism, and violence against Native Americans.\nThe Catholic sex abuse scandal has shown the worst side of clericalism. The Church hierarchy chose to protect its clerics and the institution at all costs and at the expense of the most vulnerable. According to the 2004 John Jay Report , “The Nature and Scope of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Catholic Priests and Deacons in the United States 1950-2002,” sexual abuse of minors was widespread throughout the country.\n“The survey responses make it clear that the problem was indeed widespread and affected more than 95% of dioceses and approximately 60% of religious communities.”\nAccording to the report, “approximately 4% of Catholic priests and deacons in active ministry between 1950 and 2002 have been accused of the sexual abuse of a youth under the age of 18.” When looking at the year of ordination, the report found that “the percentages of accused priests range from a maximum of almost 10% in 1970, decreasing to 8% in 1980 and to fewer than 4% in 1990.”\nIn 2022, a New York court released the deposition transcript of Bishop Howard Hubbard , who led the Diocese of Albany from 1977 to 2014. He testified that he attempted to cover up sexual abuse allegations instead of seeking justice and providing support for the children and families impacted.\nWhen priests admitted to Hubbard that they committed abuse, Hubbard did not report it to police. When pressed as to the reason why, Hubbard said he felt that as the bishop, he was “required” to protect the reputation of the Church and his diocese.\nIn 2024, OSV News found that an $880M abuse settlement from the Archdiocese of Los Angeles brought the total payout amount for U.S. Catholic dioceses to more than $5 billion.\nIn response to this widespread sexual abuse scandal, throes of Catholics have left the Church, which has been forced to close or merge parishes and schools throughout the country. FutureChurch, a Catholic nonprofit that advocates for Church reform, commissioned a 759-page CARA report to investigate such closures.\n“Between 1970 and 2020, baptisms declined 57%, Catholic marriages declined 78%, and Catholic funerals declined 14%,” it found. The report also noted that Black, Latino, and poor parishes are disproportionately closed.\nWhile the average proportion of white residents was lower in neighborhoods where parishes closed and higher in neighborhoods where parishes were opened, “in all 11 dioceses, the average proportion of people below the poverty line, people unemployed, Blacks/African Americans, and Hispanics/Latinos was higher in those neighborhoods where parishes closed/were absorbed than in those neighborhoods were parishes opened/expanded,” the report concluded. (The sole exception was for Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods in the Archdiocese of Miami.)\nThe correlation between parish closures and the percentage of Black residents was statistically significant in nine dioceses, while it was only statistically significant for the percentage of Latino residents in two dioceses.\nIn a written comment on the report, Dr. C. Vanessa White wrote to Religion News Service that “Black Catholics in closed parishes experience ‘emotional and spiritual pain’… and have expressed concern and anger ‘at what is perceived as a failure of Catholic leadership to pastorally and spiritually care for the needs of Black Catholics.’”\nSuch closure patterns stand in direct contrast to the preferential option for the poor, which emerged from Latin American liberation theology. Especially when Catholic schools are closed in low-income Black communities that have underperforming public schools, it often removes the one source of education that has the potential to lift students and families out of poverty through educational attainment. Closing these churches and schools had devastating impacts that ripple through the community for generations.\nUnfortunately, the disparate treatment of Black and Latino Catholics continues centuries of systemic oppression inflicted on people of African descent and the Indigenous, whom the Catholic Church has not truly reckoned with. As Fania Davis also writes , “Our nation was born in the horrific traumas of genocide and slavery. Because we have neither fully acknowledged nor reckoned with these twin traumas, much less worked to heal them, they perpetually reenact themselves transgenerationally.”\nSr Jamie T. Phelps explains how the Catholic Church’s seminal blessing of the transatlantic slave trade, which led to the enslavement of people of African descent for four centuries, and the near genocide of Indigenous people due to European colonization of the Americas, were the original sins of this nation and the U.S. Catholic Church.\nAdditionally, the Catholic history we are taught focuses almost exclusively on European colonizers and immigrants. The experiences of Native, Black American, Hispanic, and Asian Catholics are, according to Phelps, “relegated to margins or to collected anecdotes in volumes of general U.S. history.”\nOne such story that has been brought to the fore in recent years came via the Black Catholic journalist Rachel L. Swarns , who exposed the Church’s owning and selling of African Americans who built Georgetown University. In “ The 272: The Families Who Were Enslaved and Sold to Build the American Catholic Church ,” Swarns writes:\n“For more than a century, the American Catholic Church relied on the buying, selling, and enslavement of Black people to lay its foundations, support its clergy, and drive its expansion. Without the enslaved, the Catholic Church in the United States, as we know it today, would not exist.”\nEven so, there is hope for healing. Catholic Mobilizing Network (CMN) believes that restorative practices can enable Catholics to listen, rebuild trust, and deepen a culture of encounter. In “ Conversations in Communion: Parish Dialogues for Connection & Understanding ,” CMN writes:\n“Listening ennobles everyone involved: those who share and those who receive. This is a sacred discipline of being radically present to the wholeness of one another’s humanity. Listening processes that are crafted with intention create the conditions for metanoia, as hearts, minds, and spirits may be converted and new possibilities revealed by presence to one another and the movement of the Holy Spirit.”\n“The aims of the [Synod on Synodality] and the practices of restorative justice invite us all to a profound posture of listening, of encountering one another by recognizing our equal, shared, God-given dignity, and of centering marginalized people and excluded voices. Each invites us to invoke the Holy Spirit’s accompaniment, to slow down and notice how the Spirit of God is moving through and with the Body of Christ—inside and outside the Church—so that we may more wholeheartedly and effectively fulfill our mission to proclaim the Good News in a hurting world that needs the love of Christ.”\nThough the challenges facing the Catholic Church are very large, I believe small efforts at every parish are needed to retain parishioners and bring back former Catholics who may have left due to unaddressed traumas and unanswered questions. A radical commitment to listening is a way to build community focused on storytelling and heartfelt conversations. The Church must make space to allow people to express and hold an array of emotions and experiences—even those that seem impossible to overcome.",
