  "text": "As featured on\nThe Vatican says Pope Francis remains in critical condition and blood tests show early kidney failure but he remains alert and “well-oriented.” Prayers for him poured in from around the world, from his native Argentina to the seat of Sunni Islam in Cairo to schoolchildren in Rome. In New York, Cardinal Timothy Dolan said what many in Rome weren’t saying publicly: that the Catholic faithful were united “at the bedside of a dying father.” On Saturday morning, Francis suffered a prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis while being treated for pneumonia and a complex lung infection. He also had blood transfusions to treat a low platelet count.",
