  "text": "Members of London's Catholic community say they're praying in solidarity for Pope Francis as the 88-year-old pontiff remains in critical condition on Sunday.\nThe Pope has been in Rome's Gemelli hospital since Feb. 14, battling pneumonia and a complex lung infection. His latest blood tests on Sunday showed early kidney failure but the pontiff remains alert, \"well-oriented\" and attended Mass, the Vatican said.\nPope Francis diagnosed with kidney issues, remains alert, Vatican says Despite shock and concern for the Pope's health, Catholic Londoners are hopeful he will recover, said Catherin Anne George, a Catholic chaplain for the Royal Canada Naval Reserve.\n\"I think that people are perhaps, like me, in a little bit of shock and disbelief. He has changed the church and he has changed the world for the positive in so many ways,\" she said.\nOn Saturday, the Vatican said the Holy Father's condition was critical and he is not out of danger. In its latest update Sunday afternoon, the Vatican said Francis hadn't had any more respiratory crises since Saturday night but was still receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen. His prognosis remains reserved, doctors concluded.\nSome blood tests showed \"initial, mild, kidney failure,\" but doctors said it was under control. The decrease in his platelet count, necessary for clotting, that was first detected Saturday was stable.\nLondoner Sarah Serratore says she's been keeping the Pope in her prayers and is remembering his words of faith and hope during these tough times. (Isha Bhargava/CBC) Although news of the Pope's declining condition has been devastating for many, the faith instilled in them by the Pope is keeping them strong during these tough times, said Sarah Serratore, who attended a Sunday morning service at St. Peter's Cathedral Basilica in downtown.\nSerratore recalled losing her infant son at 16 days old a few years ago, and credits Pope's comforting messages of hope in helping her through her healing journey.\n\"I've been praying for him and this is the year of hope and we have to give that to anybody that we encounter, so it's crucial we do that. I believe we can make a difference in people's lives, and the Pope has instilled that in me and has given me that hope and faith to continue,\" she said.\n\"If it wasn't for this church, my faith and the Pope I would not be here today.\"\nTony Biviano said although he didn't know much about the Pope's reforms, he's appreciative of the pontiff's empathy toward the plight of people experiencing poverty. Biviano believes the Pope has made inroads in helping impoverished communities, he said.\nPrayers for Pope held across denominations Faith leaders across the world held unified prayers for the Pope, as well as other Christian denominations in London, such as the St. Paul's Cathedral, an Anglican church.\n\"It was very helpful for me to know that people are praying together and you could feel how much impact he's had well beyond the Roman Catholic church,\" said George. \"He really has done so much within the world and he has truly been that interactive, discerning heart with all people.\"\nCatherin Anne George and her student, Maggie give Pope Francis a book of messages signed by the local London community, during their trip to the Vatican in 2016. (Submitted by Canon Kevin George/ COPYRIGHT: Osservatore Roma) George, who travelled to the Vatican and met the Pope through the Canadian Campus Catholic Ministry in 2016, said she was moved by how personable he was and he made sure to individually greet each of the 128 delegates from across the world. Every person who approached him felt as if they were the only person in room, she said.\nPrayers at St. Paul's were led by George's husband, Dean Canon Kevin George who described the Pope as a big Christian presence in the world, and said his humility has had a ripple effect across the entire Christian community.\n\"For me as a priest in the Anglican church, he may not be my Pope but he is the leader of the Christian world and we look to someone like him to set the tone and he has really set a tone which is wrapped up in love and justice, kindness and mercy,\" he said.\nA pre-written message that had been prepared for Francis to read Sunday but did not deliver said he was \"confidently continuing my hospitalization at the Gemelli Hospital, carrying on with the necessary treatment; and rest is also part of the therapy!\" He continued to ask for prayers for him.",
