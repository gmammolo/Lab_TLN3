  "text": "Chiemelie Ezeobi To thank God for a year of abundance, life, healing, prosperity, Amasu Praise Night and Thanksgiving 2023 was a night of praises, prayers, sermon and worship. Themed Power of Praise, the entire thanksgiving was berthed on Psalm 100 vs 1 which says “Make a joyful noise unto the Lord oh Ye Lands”. The event was premised on “For the Almighty God has been faithful, full of kindness, protective, merciful, therefore we shall praise Him with understanding”. Held in Amasu Village Square (Ogo Amasu) on December 28, 2023, Amasu, one of the many villages that dot Arochukwu Local Government Area in Abia State, was agog. According to the convener, Pastor Elijah Ikechukwu Eze, the vision to hold the annual thanksgiving started six years ago when he clearly heard God tell him to get the entire village to praise Him. He said: “I started this vision you see today when I clearly heard God tell me six years ago that ‘Amasu should praise Him’. “At first, I was scared to tell people what I heard because I felt they would laugh at me. But I knew I received this message from God. I had no choice but to obey. “Six years down the line, we are seeing the fruit of the obedience. Amasu is growing in leaps and bounds today. “When we started, I could count the number of storey buildings at the top of my fingers but today, that singular obedience has brought astronomical growth to our village. “Now, we have buildings springing forth on every corner. The sons and daughter of Amasu are doing great and it’s worth giving God thanks again.” Corroborating, the Special Adviser to Abia State Governor on Internally Generated Revenue, Mazi Isaac Chimereze Okoro (Okeigbo), said he was also pleased at the rate of growth being witnessed in Amasu Village. He also commended the convener of the event for his doggedness in holding firm for the past six years despite all odds. Pledging to key into the event henceforth, he said it was a pointer to other villages in Arochukwu that God honours obedience. In his sermon, the Guest Minister, Pastor Emeka Okereke of Grace House, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, said thanksgiving brings blessings and harvest. He charged the teeming crowd on the need to acknowledge God for what He has done for them throughout the year, adding that it was also a call to repentance because God needs His people to be holy. After the sermon, the crowd was led in an hour of hot praises and worship that entered into the wee hours of the morning, by Minister Godwin Marshal (Apostle of Worship). Earlier, Pastor Moses Okomba had also led the crowd into another session of worship, which the convener, Pastor Eze, said was the sole essence of the gathering. However, beyond the sermon, praises and worship, there were also prayers of thanksgiving, repentance and healing. Encouraged at the turnout, the convener pledged to keep the faith and obedience to God who gave the vision.
