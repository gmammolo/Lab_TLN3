A Rorate Caeli Mass is a candlelight Mass that honors the Blessed Virgin, in anticipation of the birth of Christ. Rorate Caeli comes from the Introit, or entrance chant, used during Advent from Isaiah 45:8 — “Roráte caeli désuper, et nubes pluant iustum.” (“Drop down dew, ye heavens, from above, and let the clouds rain the just.”) The Mass is an opportunity to reflect, through the liturgy, on Mary’s role in salvation history. Historically, the Mass would be celebrated by candlelight before dawn. The sun rising at the end of Mass symbolized the journey from darkness to light and the coming of the infant Jesus, the light of the world. For practicality sake, the Mass is now often celebrated in the evening. Father Burkemper, pastor at Immaculate Heart of Mary, said the Rorate Caeli Mass for the Blessed Virgin Mary would begin in darkness with candlelight and concluded as the sun is rising signifying the “dawn of salvation” that comes with the Incarnation and the birth of Christ at Christmas.
