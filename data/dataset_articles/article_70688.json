  "text": "WATERTOWN – Flutura (Gega) Spaho, a devoted mother and wife, adoring grandmother, and beloved sister, peacefully transitioned from this world on Dec. 27, 2023, at Waterbury Hospital surrounded by the warmth and love of her family. Born on Dec. 27, 1949, in the town of Pojan, Albania, Flutura’s life journey began and ended on the same remarkable date, echoing the depth and completeness of her presence. Daughter of the late Fuat and Ylfete (Dulo) Gega, Flutura’s life was woven with love, laughter, and an unwavering dedication to her family. In 2010, alongside her devoted husband, Server Spaho, she embarked on a new chapter, embracing the United States as their home and settling in Watertown, where she graced the lives of all those who were fortunate enough to know her. Flutura’s truest happiness blossomed in moments shared with her beloved family, especially her cherished grandchildren, Marina and Eri Spaho. Her legacy of love and kinship lives on through her husband, Server, and adored sons, Aurel Aleks Spaho and Leonart Spaho. Aurel and his wife, Ermira, were not just family but also her nurturing sanctuary, while Leonart remained a steadfast embodiment of her enduring love. Flutura’s love extended beyond her immediate family to embrace her brother, Meleq Gega, of Waterbury; and her sisters, Muazes Kazazi of Greece, Ikbale Spaho, and Pellumbeshe Kulla, both residing in Albania. Her departure leaves a void that will be keenly felt by all who were touched by her kindness, grace, and unwavering affection. As we bid farewell to Flutura, we celebrate a life beautifully lived – a life that touched countless hearts, radiating warmth, compassion, and an unwavering commitment to those she held dear. Her memory will forever be cherished, her spirit a guiding light for those who had the privilege of knowing her. In the quiet moments of remembrance, may her laughter echo, her love resonate, and her legacy endure as a testament to a life remarkably lived. A funeral service will be 9:30 a.m. Saturday, Dec. 30, 2023, at Chase Parkway Memorial/The Albini Family Funeral Home, 430 Chase Parkway, Waterbury. Burial will follow at New Pine Grove Cemetery, Waterbury. Calling hours for Flutura will be Friday, from 5 to 8 p.m.. at the funeral home.
