  "text": "EUGENE, Ore -- The Eugene Mission has a long history of helping out the community, and in 2023 they continued their legacy.\nChristmas Eve and Christmas Day were two of the busiest days of the year for the Eugene Mission. According to organizers like Director of Life Change Denver Harris, it was an unforgettable experience.\nHe said, \"Christmas Eve was probably the highlight of the year for me here at the Eugene Mission, we had a candlelight service for communion.\"\nMore than 90 Eugene Mission guests showed up for the open house hosted by the Mission on Christmas Eve alone. Director of Philanthropy Beth Sheehan said it was one of the largest gathering they've seen in years. Plenty of staff and volunteers were standing by to tend to the Mission's guests.\nMost of the guests have battled through their own struggles and are using the mission's rehabilitation programs. There were plenty of activities at the open house, from gingerbread house contests to religious services.\nHarris said, \"We had family that showed up for the guests and actually engaged in the service with us. We had a candlelight lighting at the end that was incredibly moving and there was a lot of hope that was presented and taken from that service.\"\nChristmas Day was followed by more activities for the guests. It was a day of hot meals and gifts, and most of the gifts came from a Les Schwab toy drive. There was even live music at the Learning Center at the Mission. More than 200 people came through on Christmas Day according to organizers.\nSheehan said, \"We've been spending today cleaning everything up, including the soup that splashed all over the floor and starting to put Christmas away, but it was probably the most festive Christmas we've had yet.\"\nReflecting on 2023, the directors said it was a productive year for the community organization. They are grateful for the support from the community, which according to them is extremely high right now. For the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, the organization feels like they're back on their feet. They credit this resurgence in 2023 with the availability of new programs at the Eugene Mission, and with providing a more interactive volunteer experience.\nSheehan said, \"We've seen a huge increase of the classes that we're offering for our guests that are life skills, that are sober recreation, and hobby development as a sober person. They're taking taking classes in 12 week blocks.\"\nOver 200 volunteers now help out at the Eugene Mission. It's a far cry from where the mission was just a few years ago.\nSheehan said, \"One of the wonderful challenges that we have is that we are running out of classroom space, and so we're going to be looking at a classroom expansion project. \"\nThe plan heading into 2024 for the Eugene Mission is expansion of programs. They are getting ready to complete a barista training project as one of the life skills classes. These vocational classes, according to the directors, are incredibly important and successful.\nHarris said, \"Getting people CDLs, getting people into welding school, getting people into the culinary department, it's something that we started three years ago, but now it's starting to get a lot of momentum behind it.\"\nSheehan also talked about the possibility of making an alumni program for volunteers. Many of them were once guests at the Eugene Mission themselves.",
