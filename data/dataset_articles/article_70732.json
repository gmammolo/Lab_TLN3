  "text": "How you can give a gift to a million people\nFREE Catholic Classes\nJesus gave the gift of salvation to billions of people. It is the single greatest act of mercy and generosity in all history. It is the very basis of our Catholic faith. But He left us with one responsibility. To share this gift with others. In fact, He commanded us to do so.\nHi readers, it seems you use Catholic Online a lot; that's great! It's a little awkward to ask, but we need your help. If you have already donated, we sincerely thank you. We're not salespeople, but we depend on donations averaging $14.76 and fewer than 1% of readers give. If you donate just $5.00, the price of your coffee, Catholic Online School could keep thriving. Thank you. Help Now >\nCan you give a gift to one million people?\nHighlights\n[Deacon Keith Fournier](/search/?q=Deacon+Keith+Fournier)\n12/28/2023 (14 hours ago)\nPublished in\n[Living Faith](/news/hf/faith/)\nNot everyone can preach. But we can still do our part. This year, we are asking you to give a gift that will help a million people.Â\nCatholic Online School has reached the incredible milestone of one million student enrollments! By providing everyone with a FREE, world-class, Catholic education, we are evangelizing and converting people. We are helping lapsed Catholics return to their faith. We are catechizing the young and old alike. We provide refreshers for lifelong Catholics. And because we are magisterial, many schools and parishes are using our courses to teach.Â\nWe provide all this to you and millions of others, for FREE.Â\nOf course, these resources are free to use, but they are not free to produce. They come with costs that must be paid. Each course we produce costs us to pay for the writing, editing, production, hosting, and much more. Dozens of people work behind the scenes on each course, lending their God-given talents to building and operating this incredible school.Â\nTo keep Catholic Online School free, and to keep doing this important work, we need support from private individuals like you. Just as Jesus and the Apostles relied upon the generosity of others to perform their missionary work, we also rely upon people like you.Â\nWe know times are tough. We've noticed too. We've tightened our belts because this is such important work. And we don't want anyone to feel bad if they can't give now. But if you can do something, even just $5, it makes a difference. When you donate to this Apostolate, you are literally giving a gift to a million people. How many in history can say they gave presents to a million people? Not many, but now you can.Â\nPlease give generously what you can today to keep Catholic Online School FREE for anyone, anywhere!\n[Join the Movement](/newsletters/)\nWhen you sign up below, you don't just join an email list - you're joining an entire movement for Free world class Catholic education.\n-\n-\nMysteries of the Rosary\n-\nSt. Faustina Kowalska\n-\nLitany of the Blessed Virgin Mary\n-\nSaint of the Day for Wednesday, Oct 4th, 2023\n-\nPopular Saints\n-\nSt. Francis of Assisi\n-\nBible\n-\nFemale / Women Saints\n-\n7 Morning Prayers you need to get your day started with God\n-\nLitany of the Blessed Virgin Mary\nCatholic PDFs - Print - Free Light a Virtual Prayer Candle\nDaily Catholic\n[Daily Readings for Friday, December 29, 2023](/bible/daily_reading/?select_date=2023-12-29) [St. Aileran: Saint of the Day for Friday, December 29, 2023](/saints/sofd.php?month=December&day=29) [I Came to You Late: Prayer of the Day for Friday, December 29, 2023](/prayers/prayeroftheday/?select_date=2023-12-29) [Daily Readings for Thursday, December 28, 2023](/bible/daily_reading/?select_date=2023-12-28) [St. Anthony the Hermit: Saint of the Day for Thursday, December 28, 2023](/saints/sofd.php?month=December&day=28) [Litany to the Sacred Head of Jesus: Prayer of the Day for Thursday, December 28, 2023](/prayers/prayeroftheday/?select_date=2023-12-28)\nFREE Catholic Classes Pick a class, you can learn anything\n[Saints & Angels](/saints/)\n[Prayers](/prayers/)\nYour Donation Matters Most | Help Save Catholic Education\nCopyright 2023 Catholic Online.
