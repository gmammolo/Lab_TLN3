  "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accepted an invitation that holds great significance in the cultural and spiritual landscape—the inauguration of the BAPS Hindu Mandir in Abu Dhabi on February 14, 2024.This auspicious event, confirmed by the temple authorities, follows a formal meeting where the invitation was extended by Pujya Swami Ishwarcharandas and Swami Brahmaviharidas, alongside the board of directors.Nestled in Abu Mureikha along the Dubai-Abu Dhabi highway, the BAPS Hindu Mandir is set to become the first traditional Hindu stone temple in West Asia. Its roots trace back to 2015 when Prime Minister Modi’s visit prompted the UAE government to allocate the land for this historic project. Cementing his connection further, Modi virtually participated in the Shila Pujan in 2018.Swami Brahmaviharidas expressed anticipation for the inauguration, terming it a millennial moment of celebration, underscoring its grandeur and cultural significance. Prime Minister Modi resonated with this sentiment, characterizing the temple as an ideal spiritual space—a meeting point for diverse cultures and civilizations, symbolizing spiritual harmony and progress.The hour-long meeting at the Prime Minister’s residential office was marked by discussions between the BAPS delegation and Modi. Key topics included the global significance of the temple and its alignment with Modi’s vision for India ’s spiritual leadership on the global stage. Discussions delved into the Abu Dhabi temple’s role in fostering global harmony and Modi’s overarching vision for India’s spiritual leadership.During the meeting, memories of Pramukh Swami Maharaj and his centenary celebrations surfaced, prompting Prime Minister Modi to extend heartfelt prayers for Mahant Swami Maharaj’s health , the esteemed president of BAPS. In a touching gesture, Mahant Swami Maharaj’s personal invitation was presented to PM Modi, affectionately describing him as “Pramukh Swami na Priya Putra Modi Saheb” or “The most beloved son of Pramukh Swami Maharaj, Modiji.”Expressing gratitude, Prime Minister Modi commended key individuals, volunteers, and supporters involved in the BAPS Hindu Mandir project in Abu Dhabi. He specifically recognized Chairman Ashok Kotecha, Vice Chairman Yogesh Mehta, and Director Chirag Patel for their significant contributions, acknowledging them as sources of pride for India on this momentous occasion.",
