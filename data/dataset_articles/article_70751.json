  "text": "(Minghui.org) The Minghui website recently published news that some practitioners in Guiyang City, Guizhou Province, had been arrested, harassed and detained for publishing “solemn statements.” My heart felt heavy when I read this. I wondered if the police had dared to do this because of loopholes in these practitioners’ cultivation. Master Li (the founder of Falun Dafa) said, “... everything that happens today in the ordinary society is the result of Dafa disciples’ thoughts.” (“ [Fa Teaching Given at the 2002 Conference in Philadelphia, U.S.A.](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/20021130L.html),” Collected Teachings Given Around the World, Volume II) After the sharing “ [The Importance of Issuing a Solemn Statement](https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2022/5/22/201439.html)” was published on Minghui website last year, I noticed the volume of solemn statements increased. This is a good thing, because it indicates that more former practitioners have returned to their cultivation path. The opportunity to write a solemn statement is another chance for practitioners who didn’t do well, and shows Master’s great benevolence. As stated in the sharing, “We must take the solemn statement seriously and not take Master’s mercy for granted. We should avoid making the same mistake of renouncing our faith under pressure again and again.” Some practitioners resumed cultivation and have done well. However, others have not done well. They made the same mistake over and over again and had to write solemn statements over and over again. Isn’t this a reflection of loopholes in cultivation that can be taken advantage of by the evil? Recently, many of us watched the film “Once We Were Divine.” The film showed the horrific scene that occurs when Dafa disciples’ righteous thoughts falter, which brings disaster to all sentient beings in our own heaven. However, when the King of Light refused to give in to the evil, his entire heavenly world returned to light. This reminded me of what Master taught us, “Once a vow is signed, it must be fulfilled!” (“ [Cultivation in Dafa Is Serious](https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2023/9/2/211137.html)”) Cultivation in Dafa is serious. If one makes the same mistake over and over again, it discredits Master and Dafa. It is also a stain on one’s cultivation. In order to do the [three things] well and cultivate ourselves well, we must study the [Fa] well. In particular, practitioners who suffered persecution and later wrote a solemn statement, should not be in a hurry to get involved in Dafa activities. Instead they should study the Fa with a calm mind and search within for any gaps in their cultivation that led to their persecution. Only by truly improving in the Fa and cultivating oneself, can one do the three things well. We once vowed to come down to this world together to assist Master in Fa-rectification, so we can return to Heaven together. Dafa disciples―we must fulfill our vows! Note: This article only represents the author’s current understanding meant for sharing among practitioners so that we can “Compare with one another in study, in cultivation.” (“Solid Cultivation,” [Hong Yin](https://en.falundafa.org/eng/hongyin/v3/hy.htm#20)) Copyright © 2023 Minghui.org.
