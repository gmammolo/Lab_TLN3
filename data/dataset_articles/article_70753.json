  "text": "(Minghui.org) I am from the countryside and started practicing Falun Dafa in 1997. I didn’t have a true understanding of Dafa for the first four years of my cultivation. Therefore I wasn’t that serious and wasted a lot of precious time. Someone who did not understand Falun Dafa reported me to the authorities in 2003. My home was ransacked and I was held in a detention center for a month. I was injected with unknown drugs, and taken to brainwashing sessions for two months. The drugs made me feel dizzy. I lost my memory, all my hair turn white. and a lot fell out. I also lost a few front teeth. After my release, I studied the [Fa] a lot and slowly my memory returned. I read the [Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party] thoroughly when it was published in 2004, and came to understand the evil nature of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In order to free all sentient beings who had been poisoned by the CCP’s lies and propaganda, I began to distribute the Nine Commentaries in large quantities. Since then, I have officially embarked on the cultivation path of assisting Master Li (Dafa’s founder) in rectifying the Fa. I [clarify the truth] about Falun Dafa, and fulfill the vow I had made eons ago. There were a few Dafa practitioners in my village, and some of them were too afraid to go out to distribute materials. So I did it by myself, either riding on my motorcycle or walking on foot through villages and alleyways. Sometimes I went to faraway markets. I carried half a bag of materials with me, and did not miss any home in the village. During the busy farming time, I went to the fields, side streets, and yards, distributing Dafa materials as I walked, urging people to quit the CCP and its youth organizations. I never slacked off no matter the weather. The road was icy and slippery after the snow fell, but I kept riding my bike as fast as ever. A girl saw me, and shouted, “Auntie, slow down, you may fall.” Year after year, I have clarified the truth to many people. I met those who are predestined to be saved every time I went out, sometimes more than 30 people, and at least a dozen a morning. I had only one thought on my mind, “I hope that all sentient beings can understand the truth as soon as possible, and be saved by Dafa.” I held no discrimination when I told people about Dafa, because everyone in the world today was once Master’s relative and should be saved. So whoever I met, whether a single person or a group, I would talk to them calmly, without any fear or negative thoughts. Master was by my side, watching over me. What I did was the most righteous thing in the world. As long as I followed the right path I would not face any danger. There wasn’t much work during the winter, and there would often be a dozen or so people sitting outside and chatting in the sun. I would walk over and talk to them with a smile on my face. After they understood the truth about Dafa, most people agreed to quit the CCP and asked for more information. Some people praised me and said, “You are so eloquent when you talk. Are you a college graduate?” I knew that Master was getting everything ready, and I was just carrying it out. Master saw my desire to save people, and opened up my wisdom. I have been clarifying the truth over the years and rarely encountered any problems. Many people were grateful after learning the truth. Some people offered me water, fruit, or food, but I declined them all. In winter, some people saw that my face was red from the cold, and invited me in to warm myself and were reluctant to see me leave. I was happy to see all the sentient beings being saved and extremely grateful to compassionate Master. Blessings from Heaven I once told an older man that I had blessings for him. He waved his hand gesturing that he didn’t want to listen. I told him that it is a blessing from Heaven, “How can you not want it?” He replied, “It is a gift from Heaven, then I have to take it.” and he happily accepted the brochures. I continued, “If we have a healthy body when we are old, we won’t need our children to take care of us, and we won’t have to suffer because of pain. Steamed buns and pickles will be tastier than any delicacies one eats, don’t you think so?” The man agreed. I told him some basic truths about Dafa, and said, “Dafa will protect you as long as you sincerely recite ‘Falun Dafa is good, Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good’ every day.” He kept agreeing. Party Secretary Quits CCP I went into a house to clarify the truth. The man in there said, “I am the Party secretary, and that’s what I do [persecute Falun Dafa practitioners].” I said, “Brother, in this position, it is more important for you to understand the truth and be saved. Police chiefs, provincial Party secretaries, senior leaders, and Party and government officials, are all the same to me. We are not trying to be against anyone, we just want everyone to avoid disaster and plagues, stay healthy, and have a happy and safe family. “Many senior CCP officials, such as Li Dongsheng, Bo Xilai, Wang Lijun, Guo Boxiong, Su Rong, Xu Caihou, Zhou Benshun, Fu Zhenghua, have all been dismissed from the Party. On the surface, it was because they were corrupt, but in reality, it was retribution for their involvement in the persecution of Falun Dafa. Once learning the practice, people stop smoking, drinking, gambling or having affairs. They will not cheat or lie and will be good to their neighbors. Officials will not be corrupt. There will be good people everywhere. “Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is Heaven’s law. Anyone who says something bad about these Dafa principles will be punished. Man is really insignificant in the face of natural disasters. Just follow Heaven’s will and you will be safe. It is to be cherished that we meet today. When you are able to survive the disasters and plagues, you will know that I am sincerely here for you.” He exclaimed, “You’re right! We need to eat, work, and make money no matter who governs. We just want to be safe. Please help me quit the Party’s organizations. I will never fight for the Party again.” I felt happy for him seeing that he could be saved. Delivering Dafa Calendars I distributed truth-clarification calendars to a home on a snowy day. The old couple refused to accept it at first. The man was impatient and told me to leave. His daughter saw the calendar and said, “Why not keep it. It’s not easy for her to come all this way in the wind and snow to bring blessings to us!” The man changed his mind and kept the calendar. I said to the woman, “I am sincerely grateful to you. How many people have died from the plague during the past three years, and most of them were elderly people. I don’t know when this plague will end. I wonder if you have heard the story of the tsunami in South Asia. Before the tsunami came, an indigenous man told people to leave the seafront quickly because he saw the seawater and the blue sky in the distance connected together, which was a sign of a tsunami approaching. “Most people didn’t believe it and drove the man away. In an instant, a tsunami came, killing more than 300,000 people. Only a few believers escaped on time and stayed alive.” Then, I told them the story of the “ [Hidden Character Stone](https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2021/8/23/194752.html)”, and said that Dafa is here to save people, to teach people to do good and be virtuous. His daughter quit the CCP, and the old couple also understood the truth. The man walked me to the gate when I left. Arrested at a Market I rode my motorcycle on a Sunday to a large market in a neighboring city, 30 km from my area to clarify the truth. The police videotaped me talking to a student and took me to the Linshi police station. They searched my bag and found a list of people wanting to quit the CCP and a set of keys. I was locked in a small room. I looked inward and believed the evil took advantage of my attachments to zealotry and showing off. I sent forth righteous thoughts to reject the old forces’ persecution and begged Master to help me. I felt my whole body was surrounded by a strong energy. The police took my keys and went to the market to look for my motorcycle, but they couldn’t find it. I told them that Police Chief Ren Changxia was killed in a car accident while persecuting Falun Dafa practitioners. There were many people in the car, but she was the only one who died. Heaven punished her for persecuting Dafa practitioners. I also told them the stories of the Hidden Character Stone and the staged Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident. They let me go after getting permission from their chief. The next day, I went out to clarify the truth as usual. Master Helps Everybody I rode 60 miles to clarify the truth once. I ran out of gas on the way back, when I was still 20 miles from my home. I was desperate since there was no place to refuel nearby, and asked Master for help. I indeed got home safely. Another time, I stayed too late clarifying the truth in a market. I was afraid of delaying making lunch for my husband, but I still had to drive 25 miles to my home. So I asked Master in my heart to help me drive my bike quickly. I was able to reach 80 miles per hour and arrived home on time. I kept thanking Master in my heart. Through my clarifying the truth, many people have received blessings after quitting the CCP. One person told me, “I believe Dafa is good. One time I fell into a well and was about to die. I was saved and I am now fine.” Another older woman said that her daughter-in-law had been married for seven to eight years and had no children. She recited “Falun Dafa is good” every day and her daughter-in-law was now several months pregnant. There was a woman who suffered from depression and couldn't eat or sleep. Taking a lot of medicine didn’t help. Later, she recited “Falun Dafa is good, Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good” every day, and now she is fine. When she saw me, she told me that she was very grateful for my telling her the auspicious phrases -- Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good, and Falun Dafa is good. I told her that Master Li asked us to do this, so she should thank our Master. Copyright © 2023 Minghui.org. All rights reserved.",
