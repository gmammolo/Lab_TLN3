  "text": "Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from our family to yours!\nWe are very grateful for your ongoing support as we share dinners and desserts with you each week. Thank you for visiting our site and trying our recipes with your loved ones. We truly enjoy receiving emails and comments from everyone who makes our recipes. Your support makes cooking in the kitchen more enjoyable!\nWe hope that you are able to relax and spend some quality time with your loved ones this holiday season. Whether they are near or far, we hope you enjoy their company. Don't forget to indulge in some delicious treats and goodies - you can worry about your diet after New Year's. So go ahead and enjoy those\ncookies now!\nMost importantly, always remember to celebrate the birth of our Savior. God sent His Son to be born as a child, who would later become our King. This helps us to realize that material things like gifts and food are less important. My prayer is that you will praise Him with all your heart for the wonderful gift of Jesus and the peace that He brings us.\nMay the joy of Jesus fill your heart and mind as you celebrate this holiday season. Merry Christmas!\nIsaiah 9:6: \"For a child is born to us, a son is given to us. The government will rest on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\"\nLuke 2:10-11: “I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people. The Savior—yes, the Messiah, the Lord—has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David!”",
