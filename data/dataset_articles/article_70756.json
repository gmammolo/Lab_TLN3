  "text": "Beverly Jean Hoeflinger, who brought care to her work in business and in the public sector — and as a church volunteer — died Wednesday in Kingston of Perrysburg. She was 84. She had dementia, her husband, Jack Hoeflinger, said. Mrs. Hoeflinger retired from the city of Perrysburg, closing her career on the staff of Municipal Court. “She learned her job so well. She worked so well with others,” said S. Dwight Osterud, who was judge of Perrysburg Municipal Court from 1990 through 2013. “She made friends with everyone. The other staff just loved her.” Her proficiency on the court’s computer system aided her in keeping case files in order. Waiting on the public suited her temperament. “She would work the counter,” Judge Osterud said. “Working in a municipal court, you’re working with people who don’t want to be there. But she was able to handle difficult people well. “She was just a sweet lady,” he said. Mr. Hoeflinger said: “She felt she was making a contribution. That’s the kind of person Bev was.” From 1979-91, Mrs. Hoeflinger worked for NFO Research, the consumer research firm founded in 1946 in Toledo and known for years as National Family Opinion. During her tenure she had clerical duties and processed reports via computer. In her role as receptionist, NFO visitors saw her first, recalled Peggy Fodor, who worked the switchboard until 1986. “She was very meticulous. She always dressed very professionally,” Mrs. Fodor said. “And she was a just a good front person. She did well representing the company.” The pair — receptionist and switchboard operator — reported to the same boss and, in their roles, communicated often on business matters. They knew how to keep the mood light. “We were always cracking jokes on something — any little thing we could find humor in,” Mrs. Fodor said. Mrs. Hoeflinger also worked in retail for a time, including at the former Lion Store in Southwyck Shopping Center. She got her start handling office duties at Hoeflinger Real Estate in East Toledo, working for her father-in-law, Paul Hoeflinger, a realtor and developer who served on the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority. Throughout her own career, she cared for home and her children and was supportive during her husband’s 42-year career in the glass industry, duties that required him to travel extensively. A longtime member of St. Rose Church in Perrysburg, she volunteered for parish activities, particularly the ministry to provide meals after funeral services. “She helped do the cooking. Whatever was needed, she was there,” said Mr. Hoeflinger, former director of Catholic cemeteries for the Diocese of Toledo. “She had a love for the people she worked with. She felt she was helping grieving families.” She was devoted to family and enjoyed outings with friends. “She was pretty busy all the time,” Mr. Hoeflinger said. “She had great relationships with people.” She was born June 8, 1939, to Virginia and William Robert “Bob” Boyce and grew up on Steel Street in East Toledo. She was a graduate of Waite High School. Surviving are her husband, Jack Hoeflinger, whom she married June 13, 1959; daughters Judy Zollars, Kelly Bates, and Tricia Hoeflinger Heath; nine grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter. Visitation will be from 10 a.m.-2 p.m. Friday at Witzler-Shank-Walker Funeral Home, Perrysburg. A funeral Mass will begin at 1 p.m. Saturday at St. Rose Church, Perrysburg. The family suggests tributes to Hospice of Northwest Ohio or the Alzheimer's Association. Subscribe to The Blade",
