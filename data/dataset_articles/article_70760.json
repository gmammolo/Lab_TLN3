  "text": "Ayodhya Airport not just an aerodrome, it’s also a Ramayana-inspired cultural spot\nThe ‘Maharishi Valmiki International Airport Ayodhyadham’ in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya is all set to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday, December 30. The aerodrome, besides catering to pilgrims and tourists, also has cultural significance as it is designed in line with the Hindu epic Ramayana.\nSpeaking to India Today TV, Vipul Varshney, the architect of the Ayodhya Airport, said that the structure is completely inspired by the life of the Hindu god Lord Ram. During the construction, it was specifically directed that it should be the only airport in the world that has a glimpse of the story of Lord Ram, Varshney noted.\nThe airport has been built in the Nagara architectural style, which is an Indian temple style popular in the country’s northern and western regions. The structure has seven mounted peaks (shikhara) — the main peak is in the middle, and three each at the front and back sides of the airport.\nThe seven shikharas are inspired by the seven books (Kandas) of Ramayana, and the sculptures and decorations on them have been done reflecting the same. Also, the airport has been designed in a way that allows a view of Lord Ram from any location.\nA big mural of a bow and arrow has been installed outside the airport, signifying the victory over falsity, as explained by Varshney to India Today. Also, colours have been used in the landscaping of the airport, keeping in mind the five elements of nature — earth, water, fire, air, and space.\nTwo types of plaques in the murals have also been installed inside the airport — a divine plaque and a khandika. According to Varshney, an extensive study was conducted by meeting the saints and acharyas of Ayodhya, and the artists even studied the Skanda Purana (an ancient Hindu religious text) to prepare them.\nOne of the biggest murals in this airport is dedicated to Mahabali Hanuman, who was an ardent devotee of Lord Ram. This mural depicts Hanuman’s life from birth to his establishment in Ayodhya as per the orders of Lord Ram, according to folklore.\nApart from this, a massive Madhubani painting of the court of Lord Ram (Ram Darbar), as well as the depiction of his marriage to Sita also add to the cultural features of the airport.\nVipul Varshney also stated that the airport has been constructed with environmentally friendly GRC technology, which offers zero pollution caused by stones.\nThe first phase of the airport has been constructed at the cost of Rs 1,450 crore. The new terminal building, spanning 6,500 square meters, is designed to accommodate 600 peak-hour passengers, with an annual handling capacity of 10 lakh passengers.\nWatch Live TV in English\nWatch Live TV in Hindi",
