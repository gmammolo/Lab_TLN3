  "text": "Ram Mandir Inauguration: For devotees planning to attend the Aarti of Lord Ram at the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, the Ram Mandir Trust has introduced an online application process for passes, allowing individuals to secure their spots without the need to stand in queues at the temple's physical counter. As the inauguration of the Ram Mandir draws near — set for January 22, 2024 — the surge in crowds, particularly at the pass counter, has prompted the Trust to provide an online alternative for devotees. This latest initiative enables individuals to apply for passes from the comfort of their homes.\nRam Mandir Opening: Online Pass Details Prakash Gupta, a member of the Ram Mandir Trust, shared with news agency PTI, \"The trust has decided to make 20 passes available online out of the total passes being issued. This facility became operational yesterday. Now, individuals desiring to attend the Aarti can proactively obtain their passes for future dates. Twenty passes for each of the three Aartis have been made available online. Anyone can visit the website and secure a pass for a later date.\"\nThe Trust's decision to implement an online pass application system has been warmly welcomed by devotees. One devotee expressed, \"This is a commendable initiative. The public will benefit from the convenience of obtaining passes from the comfort of their homes, saving them valuable time.\"\nAnother devotee added, \"Online Aarti pass applications not only save time but also allow individuals to plan their schedules once all arrangements are in place.\"\nRam Mandir Opening: How To Book Passes Online, Aarti Timings For those interested in booking passes online, the official website of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, accessible at https://srjbtkshetra.org/ , provides the platform for securing passes.\nThe temple offers darshan timings from 7am to 11:30am and from 2pm to 7pm.\nThe temple conducts Aarti thrice a day, with Morning Jagran or Shringar Aarti at 6:30am, afternoon Bhog Aarti at 12:30pm, and evening Aarti at 07:30pm.\nFor Aarti passes, you will need to have four documents handy — Aadhaar Card, Voter ID, Driving Licence, and Passport. It is expected that having one of these should be enough for any verification/security procedures.\nAdvance booking is available for the morning Aarti, subject to pass availability while booking for the Sandhya Aarti during the day is also contingent upon availability. Devotees can plan their visits accordingly through the online pass application system.",
