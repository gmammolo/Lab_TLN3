  "text": "Media Release Houston, Dec 29: Houston Konkan Catholic Association (HKCA) celebrated their annual Christmas Gala on December 9with great jubilation and celebration at Ghazal India Cafe in Houston. The guests attending the event at the splendid venue were given a warm welcome, giveaways, 2024 event calendar and encouraged to take family photos at a photobooth. The guests were given time to settle down and mingle with each other while being treated to a variety of appetizers such as Fish cutlets, Beef Chilly, Chicken 65, Gobi Manchurian and many more. There were also soft drinks for guests to help themselves to. Events director and emcee of the evening Merryl Fernandes then started off the proceedings and requested Allen Carvalho to welcome the guests. Allen in his welcome note, extended a warm welcome to everyone present and asked the crowd to take part and enjoy themselves. Thereafter the new Core Committee (CC) members for 2024-25 were introduced to everyone. They were welcomed by the old CC in an amusing way by means of a Hawaii flower crown and funny picture garland of their current corresponding counterparts. New CC president Leslie Mathais thanked the current CC for the welcome and spoke a few words on behalf of the new CC. Next it was time for Carol singing by kids namely Abigail Furtado, Aden Mathias, Aiden Dsouza, Anessa Mathias, Ava Dsouza, Caelan DCruz, Daniel Pinto, Evonne Dsouza, Elissa Farias, Evan Farias, Kien Pattani, Kiera Pattani, Laura Pinto, Noah Suares, Roma Quadros, Ruth Samuel and Zara Monteiro. The kids sang popular Christmas carols like ‘Noel, Noel,’ ‘O come all ye faithful,’ ‘We three kings,’ ‘Mary’s boy child’ melodiously accompanied by live instruments and character enacting by a few. There was also a live Indian classical dance choreographed by Kiera Pattani when the carols were sung. This performance of kids can be seen at https://youtu.be/Vh__Ahw-goQ?si=zLwGPFcZe8VMakK9 . This was followed by another Christmas song session led by adults comprising of Anand Pinto, Allen DSouza, Clarence DCruz and Neural Farias that had a mix of Konkani and English Christmas numbers like “Baal Zalmala” , “Barfaso Munees” , “Jingle Bells” and “Here comes Santa Claus”. As “Here comes Santa Claus” was sung, Santa Claus made a surprise appearance and kids followed him mesmerized and overjoyed. Santa then distributed presents to the kids which were prepackaged by their parents beforehand. There was also a special prize distributed by Santa which was received by Yamitha Sequeira. Then the dance floor was opened, and the crowd were rocked to popular English, Hindi and Konkani numbers by well-known DJ Gary. Soon it was time for dinner and Grace before meals was said by President Ivan D'Souza and vice president Daniel Sequeira. The food counter was then opened, and the attendees were treated to a sumptuous dinner consisting of Chicken Varutha curry, Goat Kurma, Saag Paneer, Pulav rice, Kerala Paratha, Pasta and Rasmalai. Post dinner Allen Carvalho conducted a lucky draw of playing cards distributed earlier to each family and gift hampers were given to six lucky winners. The crowd was then divided into teams and a puzzle assembling game was conducted which had a reference to Mangalorean Christmas tradition. The tradition was Kuswar and prizes were given to the group that first assembled the puzzle. There were also spot prize games conducted and winners received Prizes sponsored by Sherosh Delights. Ronnie Crasta then gave the vote of thanks wherein he thanked all the members who had attended and supported the event and requested members to support the new core committee similarly. The dance session then continued, and the specialty was a Konkani Baila medley played by DJ Gary to which everyone grooved and danced. The event then gradually drew to a close and people dispersed having had a good time and a wonderful Christmas Gala celebration. Roshan D’Souza photographed the event.
