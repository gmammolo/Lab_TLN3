  "text": "By studying the gifts of the Holy Spirit in youth group and small-group Bible studies, you help teens deepen their faith. Plus, you equip them for a\npurposeful life of service in the church and in the world.\nAccording to the Bible, the gifts of the Holy Spirit differ from\nspiritual gifts. The seven gifts from the Spirit are:\n- Prophecy\n- Teaching\n- Exhorting\n- Service\n- Leading\n- Giving\n- Mercy\nEvangelical Christians cite these New Testament Bible verses as sources for gifts of the Spirit.\nRomans 12:6-8; 1 Corinthians 12:7-10; 1 Corinthians 12:28; Ephesians 4:11.\nVarious sources use different terminology for the gifts of the Holy Spirit. The Catholic Church teaches that the gifts are found in\nIsaiah 11:1-2. Those seven gifts are:\n- Wisdom\n- Understanding\n- Counsel\n- Fortitude\n- Knowledge\n- Piety\n- Fear of the Lord\nGifts of the Holy Spirit: Resources for Youth Ministry\nFor more insights about these important gifts, review the material below. Also turn to denominational resources that reflect the specific beliefs of your faith tradition.\n-\nThe 7 Gifts of the Holy Spirit\nFirst, check out this informative\nexplanation of the gifts. From a historical perspective, the website explains that Saint Bonaventure (who lived in the 13th century) popularized reflecting on these gifts as a devotional practice. Pastor Michael A. Milton writes that these gifts, “when applied to the activity of the Holy Spirit in the life of a Christian,” are not exhaustive. “They are evidence of the operation of the Spirit of God in the life of His child.”\n-\nDifferences Between Spiritual Gifts & The Gifts of the Spirit\nThis\nwebsite provides helpful distinctions between these biblical giftings. For example, God blesses us with spiritual gifts to build up his church and help it accomplish its mission. But he blesses people with gifts of the Holy Spirit to help us become more holy and to grow closer to him.\n-\nWhy the Gifts of the Holy Spirit Are So Vital\nHere’s a thorough\nhttps://youcat.org/credopedia/gifts-of-the-holy-spirit/ of why the church needs each of the seven gifts. The working of the Holy Spirit in the Church “is evident from the mere fact that it still exists after 2,000 years,” the website notes.",
