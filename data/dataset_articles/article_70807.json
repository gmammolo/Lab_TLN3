  "text": "For the first time in the history of Pakistan, a woman from the Hindu community will contest the upcoming general elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Buner district. Dr. Saveera Parkash will contest for the KP Assembly seat of PK-25 as she successfully passed the scrutiny of her documents by the Election Commission of Pakistan. She has also submitted nomination papers for reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies. She will compete with Awami National Party (ANP) leader and former minister Sardar Hussain Babak, ex-minister Riaz Khan, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) leader and ex-lawmaker Mufti Fazal Ghafoor, and others in the general elections for PK-25. Dr. Parkash graduated from Abbottabad International Medical College in 2022 and serves as the general secretary of the Pakistan People's Party's (PPP) women's branch in Buner. Her recently retired father, Dr. Om Parkash, has been an active member of the party for the past 35 years. Dr. Saveera Parkash, who was pleased with the locals' response, said she had not expected such a great response from the masses. \"Even the leaders and supporters of the religious parties appreciated my decision to contest the election,\" she said. It is pertinent to mention here that several minority families have been living in the Buner area, and several male members of the community have contested elections in the past.",
