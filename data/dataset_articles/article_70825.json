  "text": "Alpaca and donkeys featured at Holy Trinity’s Living Nativity This year, Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Elgin staged a Living Nativity with real animals. Church members in shepherd costumes staged the Bethlehem scene. The alpaca was especially impressive with a donkey, goats, and geese in the yard. Visitors could participate in this recreation of the blessed event depicting the birth of Jesus Christ. Afterwards visitors enjoyed cookies and hot chocolate in the church, followed by the regular church service at 5 p.m. Regular worship is at 5 p.m. Saturdays and 9:30 a.m. Sundays at the historic church, 357 Division St. in downtown Elgin. Sunday worship is also livestreamed on the [church's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtBwA_dkJ1sa5X7lsZg0_Zw).
