  "text": "The Indian Navy revealed the new design for Admirals' Epaulettes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced the new design for the Epaulettes during Navy Day 2023 in Sindhudurg, Maharashtra. Inspired by the Naval Ensign and incorporating elements from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Rajmudra, the new design signifies a significant shift. Rajmudra was a seal used by Shivaji Maharaj, handed down by his father Shahajiraje Bhosale, marking authenticity in his communications. Comprising the Golden Navy Button, Octagon, Sword, and Telescope, each element holds symbolic importance. The Golden Navy Button signifies a departure from colonial perspectives. The Octagon represents comprehensive long-term vision, encompassing eight cardinal directions. The Sword embodies the Navy's core purpose: prevailing in national power, conquering adversaries, and surmounting challenges. The Telescope symbolizes foresight and adaptability in a constantly evolving world. The statement emphasized that this design mirrors India's profound maritime legacy. — ANI (@ANI) [#WATCH]| Indian Navy proudly unveils the new Design of Admirals' Epaulettes.
