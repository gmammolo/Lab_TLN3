  "text": "- By [Kashish Rai](/authors/kashish-rai) - Published: Fri, 29 Dec 2023 02:43 PM (IST) - Source:JND The renowned Shani Shingnapur Temple is nestled in Ahmednagar, 65 kilometres away from Shirdi. The well-known Hindu deity Lord Shanidev, who is linked to the planet Saturn is worshipped in this well-known temple. Apart from the mandir, Shingnapur is a small village well-known for having no doors on any of its houses and for having never had a robbery reported in the area. Let us check out some interesting facts about the temple further. The majestic Shani Shingnapur Temple is dedicated to Lord Shani. (Image Source: Instagram) Interesting Facts About Shingnapur Temple - Swayambhu Deity In Shingnapur Temple - Swayambhu means “self-emerged”. It is believed that Lord Shani materialised as a black stone out of the earth. However, nobody is certain of the precise moment that Lord Shani materialised as a black statue on Earth. Nevertheless, it is also believed that the statue was discovered by some shepherds during the start of the Kaliyuga. - Legend Behind Lord Shani Statue Under Sky - When the shepherds discovered the statue, one of the shepherds had a dream in which Lord Shani came. He provided him with information regarding worshipping the statue, including specific instructions. The night that the shepherds discovered the statue, one of them dreamed of Lord Shani. They gave him instructions on how to worship the statue. The shepherd then questioned Lord Shani about whether or not to construct a temple for the statue. Shani Dev answered that a roof is not necessary. My roof is the whole sky. This explains why Lord Shani's black statue remains under the open sky. - There are no doors in the homes close to Shani Shingnapur - Within a km of this temple, there are shops, homes, and temples with simple door frames instead of actual doors.

However, on January 26, 2016, a group of about 500 women marched to the temple under the leadership of social activist Tirupati Desai. Their desire was to go inside the temple's inner sanctum but the police stopped them. The Maharashtra government was directed by the Bombay High Court to let women's admission into the inner sanctum of the temple on March 30, 2016.
