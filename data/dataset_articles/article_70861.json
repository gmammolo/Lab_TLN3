  "text": "New Delhi: Grandparents are always cool and cute but when they go the extra mile to try and do things that would make everyone feel warm and included, the cuteness only doubles up. One such story has taken the internet by storm. An elderly woman from an undisclosed location won hearts after she left handmade Ouija boards to be handed out at her funeral before she passed away. My best friends grandma made these before she passed away to give out at her funeral. What an icon [pic.twitter.com/Fo1zDOKTgC] — Pick Up Lines 🤣 (@pickuplinesonig) [December 27, 2023] A social media user took to X (formerly Twitter) to share the heartwarming story with the world. “My best friend’s grandma made these by hand before she passed away to give out at her funeral. What an icon,” the X user, @pickuplinesonig, wrote on the micro-blogging platform. Netizens were quick to respond to her cute gesture. “Wow, these are the cutest grandma-made funeral favors ever! Classic!” one individual wrote on X. “That’s incredibly heartwarming. Such a special way to honor her memory,” another one wrote. One social media user wrote, “At least she had a sense of humour!” “That’s incredibly heartwarming. Such a special way to honor her memory,” wrote another one. It is indeed a very heartwarming gesture from the elderly woman, leaving room for humour at her funeral, probably just how she wanted it to be. This is some way to go, and some way to also want yourself to be honoured after you are gone!
