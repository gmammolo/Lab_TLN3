  "text": "[Pilgrims of hope](https://aleteia.org/2022/01/14/motto-announced-for-jubilee-2025/): That’s what we are in preparation for the [Jubilee 2025](https://www.iubilaeum2025.va/en.html). And as [pilgrims ](https://aleteia.org/2023/10/09/truth-and-life-on-the-way-we-are-all-pilgrims-sometimes-despite-ourselves/)and people of [hope](https://aleteia.org/2023/04/12/hope-is-called-jesus-take-these-phrases-to-prayer-today/), we have no greater priority than growing in prayer. The Aleteia community — both readers and journalists — are united in this goal. We’re delighted to be joining with you in this common endeavor. Invite your friends! Throughout the year, we’ll have a focus on prayer, with a special [emphasis on the Eucharist](https://aleteia.org/tag/real-presence/) as part of the ongoing Eucharistic revival. But already, the Aleteia archives has so many resources for our beautiful community. By clicking [here](https://aleteia.org/tag/prayer/), you can scroll through dozens (maybe hundreds!) of articles related to prayer, with offerings for young families, liturgical living, and many others. Then, I’d like to point out a special series created by our editorial director, [Dominican Father Peter John Cameron](https://aleteia.org/author/fr-peter-john-cameron-op/). It’s called [Prayer Is](https://aleteia.org/tag/prayer-is/), and each installment is a short, but incredibly insightful, reflection on one aspect of prayer. We already have so many [how-to articles](https://aleteia.org/2018/07/18/how-to-pray-when-you-dont-know-how/) and [explanation articles](https://aleteia.org/2017/11/21/whats-the-difference-between-meditation-and-contemplation/) and [reflection articles](https://aleteia.org/2020/08/04/how-meditation-on-the-present-moment-can-relieve-anxiety/). And there’s much more to come. It’s going to be a great 2024!",
