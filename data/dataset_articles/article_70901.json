  "text": "The reopening of a small church, still consecrated but unused for years, could stop the opening of a new slot room in Faenza (Ravenna). The parish of San Marco, as reported by the Corriere di Romagna, has in fact announced in recent weeks that it has reopened the small chapel of San Rocco, owned by the ASP, for worship, thanks to a loan for use, for the holding of parties, moments of meeting and prayer. A small initiative, but one that could have an immediate effect: the land where gambling should be started now falls within a radius of 500 meters, considered a \"sensitive zone\", where, by law, it is forbidden to open activities of this type. The opening of the slot room, which had already received favorable opinion from the municipality, has been at the center of controversy in the neighborhood for months, with a petition by residents to stop it that has collected hundreds of signatures. The parish's move has now changed the cards on the table, the issue will have to be investigated by the legal departments, but the opening is much more complicated at this point. \"We,\" the parish priest Fr. Davide Ferrini told the newspaper, \"had been thinking for some time to reopen the chapel to organize moments of prayer or exhibitions. Certainly gambling is a serious problem, I don't know how much the opening of a church can affect this, but it can push someone to reflect.\"\nAll rights reserved © Copyright ANSA",
