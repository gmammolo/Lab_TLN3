  "text": "Vienna ∙ The Austrian Canaanite Catholic Community (AKCC) celebrated Holy Mass and Christmas at the Hirschstetten Church. From Spain Fr. Saju Mulakat, Fr. Jijo Mathew joined Ilavungachal and offered Holy Communion. Under the leadership of Elizabeth Coithara, the devotion of the Choir, including Brother Robin, intensified. After Holy Mass, celebrations were held in the Parish Hall. The 2022–2023 AKCC committee members, the St. Kuriakos team’s teamwork and church-community fervor, graced the occasion. As the spiritual director of the Austrian Knanaya community, Fr. Abraham Kuruttuparampil shared with the audience the letter of Archbishop Mar Mathew Mulakat officially appointing Jijo Ilavungkachal. Warming the pearl, AKCC Liturgy Coordinator Stephen Koramatham, Fr. Jijo was greeted with applause by everyone. President Abraham Kurutuparmil welcomed the ex-members who came from Switzerland and [Germany](https://www.world-today-news.com/tag/germany/) to participate in the celebrations of AKCC. With carols, tap music, and sweet Christmas Santa, Stephen led the audience to a Christmas experience on the east side. Jesin Mannaruparail, Nidiya Edappalliirail and TG Koithara led the artistic programs for children and young [women](https://www.world-today-news.com/tag/women/). 2023 college/school graduates and young [women](https://www.world-today-news.com/tag/women/) who after higher studies are proudly working in different places in Europe, AKCC honored and gave benefits to them. Piya Kannampatam moderated. Secretary Nadina Puthanpura thanked everyone. The newly appointed St. Thomas team will be in charge of the Canaanite community for the next year at the conference which concluded with a feast of love.
