  "text": "Mazu(媽祖) belief rocks in Chinese culture! She’s not just a goddess; she’s the OG protector of sailors and fishermen. People vibe with Mazu hard, especially those on the water. Her temples are like cultural hotspots, rocking traditional vibes. Mazu’s belief isn’t ancient history. It’s live and kickin’, a cultural icon saying, “Yo, sea, livelihood, safety – we’re counting on you.” It’s the heartbeat of belief, echoing through time. Sip on a cup of good coffee to usher in a prosperous Lunar New Year! cama café, in collaboration with Dajia Zhenlan Temple, presents the “BEAN SO LUCKY” divination box. May the new year bring fulfillment to your heart’s desires (where wishes meet BEAN, creating harmonious vibes). Bringing “good luck” and “blessings” to life through visual symbols, the design combines cultural elements from incense bags and sacred divination (pronounced the same as “sacred cup” in Chinese). It visually presents faith and culture, sharing with consumers a cup of visible, aromatic, freshly roasted good luck, accompanied by a resounding symbol of fortune. In this joint project with Dajia Zhenlan Temple, the goal is to preserve the essence of religious culture and the image of Mazu. Respecting cultural values, the visual language is crafted to align with contemporary aesthetics while maintaining cultural richness and local characteristics. Taking inspiration from protective charms, the design concept utilizes clean layouts to convey numerous blessings, echoing the compassionate and elegant imagery associated with Mazu. Visualizing the Culture of Faith Incense Bag 香火袋：A protective charm with the purpose of seeking blessings. Inside, it holds talismans blessed by deities and temples. Originally used to ward off evil and dispel misfortune, it has evolved to cover various aspects of life, symbolizing desires and protection, including traffic safety, wealth, childbirth, relationships, academics, health, and more. Divination Blocks 擲筊 (“筊” pronounced like “Cup” in Minnan)： After introducing oneself, one asks a question to the deity and throws the divination blocks. The state in which they land indicates whether the deity is willing to grant the wish. The Temple Font Design 筊體: To convey the intuitive image of the temple, we’ve designed a font set for the collaborative gift box. The font design draws inspiration from the calligraphy styles traditionally used on temple plaques, pillars, and lanterns. This packaging design becomes a condensed crystallization of a traditional temple in itself. Who is Mazu(媽祖), the Chinese sea goddess： Mazu is a revered goddess in Chinese folk religion, especially among seafaring communities in coastal regions. Born Lin Mo Niang during the Song Dynasty, she was known for her supernatural abilities to predict weather and save sailors from perilous conditions at sea. After her death, she ascended to become a deity, providing protection to fishermen and sailors. As such, she earned the name “Mazu,”literally translated as “Mother Ancestor.” Often depicted in red attire standing on a cloud, she is flanked by two guardian spirits who assist her. The worship of Mazu, known as Mazuism, is widespread in Mainland China, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese communities.
