  "text": "ALBANY – The long-time leader of Sweet Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church was installed earlier this month as the leader of a statewide convention of missionary Baptist congregations. Rev. Elgin J. Taylor Sr., is now the head of more than 300 churches as head of the Empire Baptist Missionary Convention. Taylor has served as pastor at Sweet Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in Arbor Hill since March 2010. Being a pastor was a dream ever since he was very young, he said. And being chosen to lead the body that oversees the missionary Baptist churches in the state was an exciting and emotional moment. That night he was thinking of his mother and other family members who had served in the convention. “To be able to see me now, in that place where they once worked and where they served so faithfully, it was an overwhelming feeling of excitement and joy,” he said. “It was a feeling of, 'I can't believe this is happening.'” Taylor comes from a religious family with roots in the Morning Star Missionary Baptist Church going back six generations. Growing up, he would walk around telling family members he would be a pastor when he grew up. “My siblings and cousins they talk about how we always had to play church in the basement, and I was always the pastor,” he said. “You know, they tease me about it now. But it's been something that's been part of my life all of my life.” Taylor began training for the ministry in 2006 under the Rev. Reverend Ronald Grant at the Shiloh Baptist Church of Hudson, where he served as executive minister to the pastor and minister of music and was ordained as a minister in 2010, according to a 2012 Times Union story. Taylor previously served the convention in several roles, including the director of music, president of the young people’s auxiliary and vice president at-large. He felt called by God to continue his service and run for election as the organization’s president. “I've been involved in the work and I just always knew somewhere along the line, that it was my destiny to be where I am today,” he said. As part of his duties Taylor will help guide the convention’s missionary work, including foreign missions. His term is for three years, with an option for another three years. “I'm responsible to pull together the team that does the programming that fulfills the mission of the convention,” he said. “We do a lot of missionary projects to help people, to help churches, not just in New York state, but we've gone globally.” While his new role will take him across the state, Taylor said his focus on his congregation at Sweet Pilgrim won’t waver. The venerable church is beginning a fundraising drive to support a $1.6 million expansion project for the 147-year-old structure, including making the church more accessible to senior worshippers and those with mobility issues. “I have this big thing going on in New York state. But the truth is my main priority remains at home,” he said.",
