  "text": "The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) congratulated the Union government for its successful efforts that led to the\ndeath sentence of eight former Indian Navy personnel being commuted in Qatar.\nThe apex elected body of Sikhs, however, asked the government to take a “sympathetic view” on the matter of Sikh prisoners as it did in the Qatar case.\nThe Indian Government had appealed against the death penalty handed to the eight men by a Qatar court on October 26 on the alleged charge of espionage. The court reduced the sentence on Thursday.\n“We congratulate the Union government and Prime Minister\nNarendra Modi for making efforts to commute the death sentence of the Indian Navy officials in Qatar. It is a success of Indian diplomatic channels. It is a good development to save the lives of Indian officers,” said former SGPC general secretary Gurcharan Singh Grewal in a video shared on social media platforms.\nਕੱਟੜ ਮੁਸਲਮਾਨ ਦੇਸ਼ ਕਤਰ ਵੱਲੋਂ ਭਾਰਤ ਦੇ 8 ਨੇਵੀ ਅਫ਼ਸਰਾਂ ਦੀ ਫਾਂਸੀ ਨੂੰ ਰੱਦ ਕਰਵਾਉਣ ਦਾ ਸਵਾਗਤ, ਪਰ ਭਾਰਤ ਦੇਸ਼ ਦੇ ਸਿੱਖ ਨਾਗਰਿਕਾਂ ਲਈ ਫਾਂਸੀ ਨਹੀ ਟਲੇਗੀ ਦਾ ਫੈਸਲਾ ਇੱਕ ਵੱਡਾ ਸੁਆਲ ਬਣਕੇ ਖੜਾ ਹੈ। ਕੀ ਮੋਦੀ ਸਰਕਾਰ ਇਸਦਾ ਜਵਾਬ ਦੇਵੇਗੀ ? – ਭਾਈ ਗਰੇਵਾਲ\n[#SGPC] [#Amritsar] [#BandiSingh] [#SikhPrisoners] [#HumanRights] [#Punjab]… [pic.twitter.com/yF7Ky09qgC]\n— Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (@SGPCAmritsar)\n[December 29, 2023]\n“At the same time, we demand the government to take a sympathetic view of the Sikh prisoners who have already\ncompleted their sentences in jails according to Indian laws. If an Islamic country like Qatar can be convinced to commute the death sentence, then why can’t the Indian government take a sympathetic view of Sikh prisoners,” he asked.\n“India is a democratic country and calls itself the country of Mahatma Gandhi. Whenever someone assumes an important office in the government, that person goes to Raj Ghat to pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi. At the same time, respective governments have not followed the spirit of the law in the case of Sikh prisoners, who have completed their sentences but are still in jail. The death sentence of Balwant Singh Rajoana has not been commuted yet despite mentioning the same in the notification issued on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Why can’t the government take a sympathetic view of Sikh prisoners as it did for the officials convicted under serious charges in Qatar?”\n“If the Qatar government can commute the death sentence of foreigners, then the Indian government should also not be rigid towards the demands of SGPC over Sikh prisoners. The central government issued a notification to commute his death sentence to life imprisonment on the eve of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak,” Grewal told\nThe Indian Express.",
