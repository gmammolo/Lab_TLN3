  "text": "Jupiter direct is all about mind power and manifestation. By [Ruby Miranda](/users/ruby-miranda) — Written on Dec 29, 2023 Photo: Jacob Lund | Canva Pro In a way, it doesn't get any better than this day's transit, Jupiter direct, as it shows us all that the power of positive thinking really does work, and being that Jupiter is no longer in retrograde, we are free to enjoy all it has to offer. This planet is associated with abundance, benevolence, enthusiasm, travel and adventure. On December 30, 2023, three zodiac signs will be embedded with positive energy. How timely is something like this? This is really a dream come true, as it sure will be nice to believe in something as we cross the threshold from this year into the next. With one day left to the year, we can once again take stock of the idea that if we want to be happy, we can wish ourselves into that position. Jupiter direct is all about mind power and manifestation. So, what we think about has a very good chance of manifesting. If we're applying this positive energy to our loved lives, then not only are we doing the right thing, but this kind of energy is explosive. We can create a snowball effect if we stay the course with positivity and optimism, and for three zodiac signs, the day looks bright and filled with opportunity. Three zodiac signs will have the luckiest love horoscopes on December 30, 2023: 1. Aries (March 21 - April 19) You don't have to be told that the planets are lining up to support you to know that no matter what's going on in the universe, you're walking into the new year with a smile on your face and love in your heart. You have paid your dues in the love department and around this time of the year, specifically on December 30, 2023, you'll be ripe and ready to take on something new, bright, bold and thrilling. You want your loved one by your side, and you want to take on the world. With the help of the transit, Jupiter direct, you'll feel as though all of your ideas are the kind that can benefit humanity. While that might sound lofty, well, that's Jupiter for you. It is the largest planet we know of and when it directly influences us, we feel it, and you feel it in particular, on this day, December 30, 2023.
