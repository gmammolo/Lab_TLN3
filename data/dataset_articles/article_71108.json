  "text": "The heart is a heavy wood, sitting in a hearth, cold and waiting. Worship is a fire that sets it ablaze. Like you, I’m living into many lessons these days. Some are old lessons I’ve needed to re-learn, and others are new lessons in which I need to master surrender. Worship is an old lesson for me. It’s the oldest lessons that are often the very best lessons. I learned anew how to light the fire of worship.\nYesterday morning I spent an hour ministering to the Lord. Yes, that’s a phrase I’m going to start using again, old school as it may sound to some.\nLight the Fire – Again\nMINISTERING TO THE LORD?\nI don’t tell you that I spent an hour in worship to sound like a hero. In fact, I felt anything but as I entered the time. And spending an hour in worship, “ministering to the Lord,” is not just for worship leaders. I had the benefit of being able to take my instrument with me into that space. But if I didn’t have it, or couldn’t play, I’d find another way.\nAnother way to minister to the Lord.\nHe was there. I was there. And my attention was on blessing Him with the 60 minutes available to me.\nI didn’t ask for a blessing this time; I wanted me to leave that place having blessed, praised, adored, and thanked, my Lord.",
