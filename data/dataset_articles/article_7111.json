  "text": "World\nMagnitude 5.5 earthquake strikes northern Peru near Ecuador border\nA magnitude 5.5 earthquake struck northern Peru near the border with Ecuador, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Shaking was reported in both countries.\nThe earthquake struck shortly after midnight on Thursday, at around 12:17 a.m. local time, the USGS said. It occurred at a depth of about 67 miles (107 kilometers).\nThe epicenter was located in a remote area of northern Peru. The nearest town, Yantzaza, in Ecuador, is located about 65 miles (104 kilometers) east of the epicenter.\nShaking was felt across parts of both countries. In Ecuador, residents in Loja reported strong and prolonged shaking, while people in Guayaquil described light to moderate shaking.\nIn Peru, shaking was reported in several northern cities, including Piura, Chiclayo, Tumbes, and Trujillo, and was also felt as far south as the capital, Lima.\nAn analysis by the USGS indicated that casualties or significant damage are unlikely as a result of the earthquake.\nEarthquakes in Peru and Ecuador are common due to the ongoing subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate along the Pacific coast. Many earthquakes in the region occur at significant depths, which can allow shaking to be felt across wide areas while reducing the likelihood of severe damage.",
