  "text": "Former Bishop of Down and Connor Patrick Walsh has been remembered for his commitment and “robust defence” of Catholic eductaion. The Co Cork-born cleric died on December 28 at Nazareth House care home in south Belfast, aged 92. His death came six weeks after that of Bishop Anthony Farquhar, who was consecrated with Bishop Walsh, and also resided latterly at Nazareth House. A maths teacher and former member of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, Patrick Walsh was ordained in 1965 and became a bishop in 1983. He was born in Cobh in 1931 before his family moved to Belfast when he was 11. He attended St Mary’s Christian Brothers’ Grammar School in west Belfast then Queen’s University Belfast from 1948 - 1952, where he studied mathematics. From there he went to the Pontifical Lateran University, Rome for four years, where he obtained a Licentiate in Theology. Following his ordination, he spent two years studying at Christ’s College, Cambridge where he obtained a MSc in mathematics and subsequently also obtained a MSc from Queen’s University. He was appointed to the staff of St MacNissi’s College, Garron Tower in 1958 and remained there until 1964, when he was appointed chaplain to the Catholic students attending Queen’s. In 1970 he was appointed president of Saint Malachy’s College, Belfast. Bishop Walsh was ordained as Auxiliary Bishop for the Diocese of Down and Connor in 1983 and in 1991 he was appointed Bishop of Down and Connor. He chaired the board of governors of St Mary’s University College in Belfast and was chair of the trustees of the four diocesan colleges, as well serving as chair of the trustees of the Mater Hospital. He retired in 2008. Bishop Donal McKeown, apostolic administrator of Down and Connor, said he learned of Bishop Walsh’s death with “great sadness”. “I know that you will join me in praying for Bishop Patrick and in offering his brother Michael and sister-in-law Angela, his late brother Jack and late sister Mary, his nieces Maria and Jacqueline, his nephew Michael, their families and his wider family and friends, our heartfelt condolences and our prayers over the coming days,” he said. Bishop McKeown said Bishop Walsh’s “personal commitment to Catholic education was well known and his robust defence of it will long be remembered”. “These early years of his priestly ministry taught Bishop Patrick that Catholic education, and the values it espouses, opens up incalculable opportunities for young people and assists the journey towards peace in a society often torn apart by violence and conflict,” he said.",
