  "text": "Kel Mitchell Reminds Fans to Seek God’s Guidance: ‘He Will Show You’ By Movieguide® Contributor Actor Kel Mitchell recently took to Instagram to encourage his followers to look to God for direction. “Happy Sunday,” he [began](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1PoqxgJI4h/) a recent Reel. “When you express your concerns to the Lord, he will show you the way to go.” “It’s just like the three wise men, right? They had a journey that they needed to go on, alright, they wanted to see Jesus, right? So, God shined a star in the east for them to follow and directed them straight to him. So, if [there is] anything that you’re going through, and you need direction, and you need a plan, and you need to know where to go, don’t spend one minute without God,” Mitchell [encouraged](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1PoqxgJI4h/). The former Nickelodeon star has been outspoken about his faith, often encouraging his fans to turn to and trust God. This Christmas season, the actor partnered with World Vision to help those in need. “I’ve been working with World Vision for years,” Mitchell [told](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/kel-mitchell-good-burger-2-world-vision-giving-back-1235765935/) The Hollywood Reporter. “They reached out to me because they know that I love giving back and helping others…I love God and giving back and putting a smile on people’s faces. And one of the quotes that I use all the time is ‘spread love like confetti.’” World Vision, a Christian humanitarian organization, [aims](https://www.worldvision.org/about-us) to show Christ’s love and “partner with children, families, and their communities to reach their full potential by tackling the causes of poverty and injustice.” As part of his partnership with the organization, Mitchell participated in its Global 6k for Water race. This represents the average distance women and children must walk to get water in developing countries. “It’s a blessing to be a blessing,” he [said](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/kel-mitchell-good-burger-2-world-vision-giving-back-1235765935/). This is something he’s teaching his children, too. “It’s a great way to show your kids how to help as well,” he [said](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/kel-mitchell-good-burger-2-world-vision-giving-back-1235765935/). “We just put up the Christmas tree and we have an alpaca ornament. And when my kids see that, they also know that we also got a real alpaca to help someone overseas and help a family. It’s really just about giving back and letting everyone know that we’re all God’s children and we’re all family.” Movieguide® previously [reported](https://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/kel-mitchell-encourages-us-to-lean-on-gods-understanding.html) on Mitchell: Actor Kel Mitchell is encouraging people to “lean” on God and work with Him to “create something cool within your life.” “When I was a kid, I wanted to learn the Michael Jackson ‘lean’ move,” the GOOD BURGER star [explained]in an Instagram video, adding that it was a difficult move that could “break your face” if you didn’t do it correctly. Mitchell went on to say that he later found out Jackson worked with a designer who made him magnetic shoes, which allowed him to perform the move. “They were working together and created something really, really cool, and that is what God is saying to you,” Mitchell said before reciting Proverbs 3:5-6. “Lean not on your own understanding…[because] you’ll end up hurting yourself. But lean on my understanding, lean on my knowledge, my ideas, and I will direct your path, and we can really create something really cool together.” He concluded, “Let the Creator who created you create something cool within your life every day. Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.” We are a crowdfunded organization, supported by people like you. These are some of the reasons why our supporters choose to give. \"Your efforts to promote that which is of the highest value. \" You can make a difference with as little as $7.
