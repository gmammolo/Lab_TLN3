  "text": "A 25-year-old man has drowned in an abandoned illegal mining (galamsey) pit at Bogyawe in the Bekwai Municipal area of the Ashanti Region.\nThe incident occurred on Wednesday, January 7, when the victim reportedly entered the pit but failed to resurface.\nAs of four to five hours after the incident, residents said the body had still not been retrieved from the water-filled pit, as rescue efforts continued.\nCommunity members say the pit was abandoned by illegal miners and left uncovered, turning it into a death trap, especially during the rainy season when such pits easily fill with water.\nResidents told Adom News that this is not an isolated case, alleging that at least two similar drowning incidents have previously occurred in the area under comparable circumstances.\nThey are calling on authorities, particularly the Minerals Commission, Environmental Protection Agency and local government officials, to take urgent action to reclaim abandoned galamsey sites and compel miners to properly reclaim degraded lands to prevent further loss of life.\nPolice have been informed of the incident, and investigations are expected to commence once the body is retrieved.",
