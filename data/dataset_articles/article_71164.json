  "text": "From the weeks-long revival service at Asbury University in Wilmore, Kentucky, to the release of Christian films and shows that provoked faith and courted controversy—and to everything between—2023 has been an eventful year for American Christians. Throughout the year, ChurchLeaders has followed several national stories, as well as highlighted the work of local ministers and everyday Christians. Some of these stories were uplifting. Others were devastating, disturbing, and sometimes even bizarre. So much has happened this year that it would be easy to forget some of it.
