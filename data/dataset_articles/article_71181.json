  "text": "Téreny, Hungary: Following in the footsteps of her family's past five generations, Jozsefne Szedlak, or Aunty Ilonka as she is widely known, leaves her home to the nearby bell tower at least twice a day.\nAs one of the few remaining bell ringers in Hungary, she has taken on the responsibility of tolling the bells at the Catholic church in Tereny, a village of 350 residents around 60 kilometers (40 miles) north of Budapest.\nBell ringer Jozsefne Szedlak, or as everyone calls her, Auntie Ilonka, rings the bell at noon in the catholic church in Tereny, 88kms far from Budapest, Hungary, on Dec. 22, 2023. Following the footsteps of her family's past five generations, Jozsefne Szedlak is one of the few remaining bell ringers in Hungary. AFP PHOTO The heaviest bell there weighs around 450 kilograms (1,000 pounds).\n\"As long as my hands and feet can handle it, there won't be an automatic system,\" says the 80-year-old grandmother of three.\n\"Because people say, and it's true, that bells die when they are automated, so a bell working by the press of a button does not chime the same.\"",
