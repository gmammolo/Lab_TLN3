  "text": "Trinity Episcopal Church on Prospect Street in Torrington on Dec. 27 received approval to run a winter homeless shelter. TORRINGTON — A homeless shelter was approved for Trinity Episcopal Church Wednesday, ending the search for a location that has continued since early spring. During a public hearing, members of the Planning & Zoning Commission heard repeatedly that the shelter plan could no longer wait, and that the city's homeless wouldn't survive much longer without help. Trinity provided shelter for people facing homelessness, pre-pandemic, along with several other churches. Its pastor, the Rev. Carrie Combs, presented the church's application this week. Trinity's receiving approval for a special permit comes just a week after the commission denied an application to run the shelter at Northwest Hills Community Church, also on Prospect Street but next door to St. John Paul the Great Academy, a K-8 Catholic school. Northwest Hills Community Church applied for the special exception permit in November, and immediately faced objections from the school and parish, led by Pastor Emmanuel Ihemedu, who said that Operation Overflow's homeless shelter running adjacent to the school would endanger and traumatize the students. Since early 2023, a group of care providers overseeing the shelter operations, along with Mayor Elinor Carbone, have been seeking a building for Operation Overflow. Before the pandemic, the effort was run by volunteers and rotated between three churches, including Trinity and Northwest Hills, for 16 years. Since 2020, supported by state funding, the winter shelter has operated at a closed school and a health center. This week, supporters of the shelter were in the majority at the commission meeting, and all said the shelter was desperately needed. \"Our unhoused residents are just as deserving as everyone else,\" wrote Julia Jagger, who works with people through Greenwoods Counseling and other groups. Julie Scharnberg from the Northwest Hills Connecticut Community Foundation, said there was a \"significant bottleneck\" of people facing homelessness, in spite of having a state voucher to obtain housing of their own. \"They can't use them (the vouchers) because they can't find people who will accept them,\" she said, adding that a growing population of seniors are also facing homelessness, because they live on fixed incomes and can't afford housing. During the public's testimony, resident Rich Rivera asked the commission and Carbone if the city was thinking ahead to avoid this year's difficulties. \"What are we trying to achieve here?\" he said. \"What do we want for the homeless; what's the ideal place?\" City Planner Jeremy Leifert, who attended the hearing, said a shelter should be in a building that's suitable for a group home. \"We're going to work on our regulations in the spring, to make it less restrictive,\" he said. Resident Allyson Schanz urged the board to grant the permit. \"It's cold, it's raining, and it's inhumane to allow these mothers (and children), fathers, veterans (not to have shelter),\" she said. \"They don't deserve to be treated as less than.\" The commissioners approved the permit unanimously after closing the hearing. Carbone told the audience that the City Council was prepared to provide up to $40,000 to help with operations and other expenses, using funds from the city's money from the federal American Rescue Plan Act. \"There's a definite need for this,\" Mele said. \"We need to fix this problem going forward. Without the funding and support from the mayor, this wouldn't be happening.\"",
