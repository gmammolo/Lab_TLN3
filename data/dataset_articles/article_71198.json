  "text": "How a pastor's faith survived 'Beautiful and Terrible Things'\nComing up Friday at 11 a.m.\n“Here is the world,” writes theologian Frederick Buechner. “Beautiful and terrible things will happen. Don’t be afraid.”\nThose words rooted Amy Butler through some of the darkest moments of her life. As Butler slowly embraced her call to be a pastor, she was rejected by her conservative evangelical family, who doesn’t believe women should be in pastoral roles.\nShe was the first woman ever appointed to lead the historic Riverside Church in New York City, but the challenges of breaking the “stained glass ceiling” almost caused her to lose her faith.\nIn her new memoir, “\nBeautiful and Terrible Things,” Butler takes us inside her life story. She covers joyful and painful moments, including the loss of a child, her unexpected divorce and the hardships of being a woman in ministry.\nGrow the Future of Public Media\nMPR News is supported by Members. Gifts from individuals power everything you find here. Make a gift of any amount today to become a Member!\nBut ultimately, as she tells MPR News host Kerri Miller on this week’s Big Books and Bold Ideas, she found that vulnerability is worth it.\nAs she writes in the introduction, “The invitation to become who we’re meant to be happens at the intersection of human pain and divine hope, and almost always in the context of relationship.”\nGuest:\nRev. Amy Butleris currently pastoring a Baptist church in her home state of Hawaii. Her new book is “ Beautiful and Terrible Things: Faith, Doubt and Discovering a Way Back To Each Other.”\nSubscribe to Big Books and Bold Ideas with Kerri Miller podcast on\nApple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, RSS or anywhere you get your podcasts.
