  "text": "Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you have probably heard about J. R. R. Tolkien, especially his most popular works of fiction: ‘The Hobbit’ and ‘The Lord of the Rings’. However, Tolkien wrote a much larger mythology BEFORE these two, ‘The Silmarillion’ being (in his and my opinion) his best and most beautiful work. Lots of texts he wrote dealt with topics that even mirrored the real world problems, especially religious questions: why would the good God (Eru Ilúvatar in his Legendarium) allow the Devil (Morgoth) and his evil to exist?\nTolkien did not take the fundamentalist interpertation of Genesis as hard, 100% history, though he did believe it is a wonderful myth (and he used that word positively, never to mean “fable” or “false story”). And yet, he did believe there was a Fall of Humankind - one has to exist, even if it was not eating from a literal tree. The text he wrote about the Fall is ‘The Tale of Adanel’, a text I think can be read independently, without knowledge of his other works.\nYou can read the story here:\nI needed to post it here partly because of simple discussion, partly because of the hard YEC and the belief Genesis 2-3 must be taken literally, as I think ‘The Tale of Adanel’ convinced that doesn’t have to be the case. But that’s just as an addition. In actuality, I would simply like to see what everyone else thinks of this story. It is rather ignored even among fans and studies of Tolkien, yet I think it is one of his best works ever. It is a great, DEEP insight into human nature that, IMO, FLAWLESSLY describes so much of human heart, history, evil, and God’s own character in just 1,649 words! (Yes, I counted.)\nPlease treat yourself and read it. You’ll see what I mean.\nAlternate link if Tumblr doesn’t work:\nThe Tale of Adanel - Wattpad",
