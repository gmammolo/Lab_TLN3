  "text": "The Guardian Pope Francis’s small step on gay rights should be welcomed Read full article The Guardian December 29, 2023 at 8:14 p.m. · 1 min read Photograph: Maria Grazia Picciarella/REX/Shutterstock I appreciate Matt Cain’s heartfelt piece in response to the pope’s blessing of same-sex relationships ( So Pope Francis has deigned to ‘bless’ gay couples? That’s not a blessing, it’s an insult, 19 December ). I agree that it does not go far enough. But some perspective from my training as a chaplain in a Catholic hospital informs my understanding. Querying the head of pastoral care, I asked when the church would ordain women. He concurred it would happen, likely in “300 years”. This is glacial terrain when it comes to major change. I believe that Pope Francis understands that the church has to go in incremental steps. Acceptable, no, but understandable, given the context.\nRev Mark Chaffin\nTroy, New York, US\n• While I understand the annoyance expressed in Matt Cain’s piece, it is a reaction that frustrates me. The problem with “all or nothing” is that we always end up with nothing. Why not accept and even congratulate the church for its small step, then support liberals in the church for more progress? The moral high ground may feel good, but it’s often lonely and can reek of petulance.\nAnthony Watts\nStrathfield , New South Wales, Australia\n• Matt Cain might have reflected on the Chinese aphorism that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Against all the odds, Pope Francis has taken that single step and surely deserves support, not vitriolic condemnation.\nJG Moorhead\nGorstage, Cheshire\n• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
