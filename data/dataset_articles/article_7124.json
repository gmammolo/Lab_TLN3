  "text": "Around 11:50 a.m. Sunday, troopers with Louisiana State Police Troop L responded to a single-vehicle crash on Louisiana Highway 21 near Louisiana Highway 438 in Washington Parish.\nThe crash claimed the life of 53-year-old James M. Brister of Angie.\nAround 11:50 a.m. Sunday, troopers with Louisiana State Police Troop L responded to a single-vehicle crash on Louisiana Highway 21 near Louisiana Highway 438 in Washington Parish.\nThe crash claimed the life of 53-year-old James M. Brister of Angie.\nThe initial investigation revealed that a 2003 Toyota Camry, driven by 45-year-old Shantrell M. Spikes of Angie, was traveling north on LA-21. For reasons still under investigation, the Toyota crossed the center line and ran off the roadway to the left. The Toyota re-entered the roadway when Spikes overcorrected and lost control. The Toyota overturned and rolled into the adjacent ditch.\nBrister, who was unrestrained in the front passenger seat, was ejected from the vehicle and died on scene. Spikes, who was also unrestrained, suffered serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital.\nDuring the investigation, Spikes showed signs of impairment and was subsequently arrested, police said. Upon her release from the hospital, Spikes will be booked into Washington Parish Correctional Facility for vehicular homicide, driving while intoxicated (first offense), careless operation and no seatbelt worn.\nAs part of the ongoing investigation, routine toxicology samples were collected for analysis. This crash remains under investigation.\nOriginally published on bloxstj.paxtonmedia.com, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.\nKeep it Clean.
