  "text": "F.P. Report\nKARACHI: Senior politicians formerly associated with MQM, Raza Haroon and Anees Advocate, along with their comrades joined the PPP on Friday, as electioneering picks up pace ahead of the February 8 general elections\nThe announcement of their affiliation with the PPP came after the duo met former president and party’s co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari in Karachi. Haroon, who also served as a provincial minister, earlier joined former Karachi mayor Mustafa Kamal’s Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) in 2016, but later left this faction as well. On the other hand, Anees was also an MQM dissident who joined PSP in 2016.\nAn official statement issued by PPP on this occasion said that Zardari welcomed Haroon and Anees, who were former members of MQM’s Rabita Committee, to the party. The politicians discussed the “charter of Karachi” regarding the development, establishment of peace and security, and friendly environment in the port city during the meeting.\n“[Former] president Asif Ali Zardari said that the PPP’s Charter of Karachi will have a far-reaching impact on the future of the city. He said that the PPP is the party of the people of Karachi.\nWe are working to restore the lights which were taken away by the rivals of peace and the merchants of hate,” the statement read. On the occasion, the ex-president mentioned the PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s 10-point election agenda, saying that the PPP will bring such developmental projects for Karachi and every other city and town of Pakistan after coming into power, which will provide relief to the common man in this time of inflation.",
