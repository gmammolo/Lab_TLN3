  "text": "BHUBHANESHWAR: Kalahandi University at Bhawanipatna has been named after Maa Manikeswari, presiding deity of Kalahandi district. The university has been functioning since September 1, 2020.Now the institution is called Maa Manikeswari University. While speaking at a function in Bhawanipatna on the foundation day of Kalahandi district, chief minister Naveen Patnaik on November 1 announced to change the name of the university.The higher education department had submitted a proposal before the chief minister to name the university after the presiding deity of Kalahandi. Naveen approved the proposal on Thursday, said the official sources.Initially, the state government had given unitary university status to the Government Autonomous College, Bhawanipatna, on March 6, 2019. The erstwhile college was started in 1960. In September 2019, the state government had converted the Kalahandi University as an affiliating university.“Starting from 1960 the institution is crowned with various names and now Maa Manikeswari University. I hope the new name will give new vigour with the blessings of Maa Manikeswari,” said Sanjay Kumar Satapathy, vice-chancellor of the university.Kalahandi University has more than 50 colleges including a medical college and five nursing colleges of Kalahandi and Nuapada districts. These colleges were functioning under Sambalpur University before the creation of Kalahandi University.The university runs a total 23 undergraduate courses and 18 postgraduate courses.",
