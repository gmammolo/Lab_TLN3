  "text": "Christmas is often considered the most wonderful time of the year. This of course is for many reasons. It celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ, it’s full of beautiful lights, presents, joy, and more. However, as the years go on, a holiday celebrated by the majority of Americans is slowly being canceled. Disney World is the next one on that list with the announcement that they will not celebrate Christmas in 2024. Remember back in the early 2000s when classrooms would celebrate Christmas? The kids would make decorations for their house, learn to wrap gifts, and even watch a Christmas movie the day before break. Companies would also celebrate Christmas with Christmas parties around the office. Over the past few years, these have gone from Christmas celebrations to holiday celebrations. It’s a slow erosion of the beloved holiday. Disney is getting on board as well by no longer celebrating Christmas in their parks.
