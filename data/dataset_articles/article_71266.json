The Grammy Award winner has released SaveNasX.com , a very '90s-style website promoting his new work that features a clock counting the time since his debut studio album Montero dropped in 2021. \"LIL NAS X hasn't released an album in over two years,\" reads a blurb on the page. \"This site is dedicated to finding him and saving him by turning his heart toward Christ's light!\" It further reads, \"Has the DEVIL-WORSHIPPING pop-artist finally been sacrificed to HIS MASTER? WHY is he SECLUDING HIMSELF???? What is he PREPARING FOR? This site will answer ALL THESE QUESTIONS AND MORE!!!... We will find Montero, and WE WILL SAVE HIM BY RETURNING HIS HEART TO J.CHRIST'S LIGHT \" Lil Nas X's latest publicity stunt comes after he made waves with his 2021 music video for \" Montero (Call Me By Your Name) ,\" which saw him riding a pole down to Hell and giving Satan a lap dance. The \"Industry Baby\" artist has since teased fans that he plans to release Christian music next. \"Y'all mind if I enter my Christian era?\" he wrote last month, sharing a taste of a potential new spiritual song.
