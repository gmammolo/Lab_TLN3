  "text": "In [Cult of the Lamb](https://thenerdstash.com/tag/cult-of-the-lamb/), the crown is the source of your power, [and the more followers you gather in your cult](https://thenerdstash.com/how-to-get-webber-in-cult-of-the-lamb/), the stronger you’ll become. Below, you’ll learn the best crown upgrades to get first in Cult of the Lamb. Although there are only four upgrades, it is worth determining which ones are necessary first, and we are going to help you with this. Cult of the Lamb: Which of the Crown Upgrades to Choose First There are a total of four upgrades for the crown. If you’ve just started playing, then you’ll understand how important it is to look out for your cult and make sure that all the followers live in comfort and prosperity. Based on this, we have created a ranked list of crown upgrades, according to which you need to progress. 1. Omnipresence First of all, be sure to choose Omnipresence. This upgrade will allow you to return to your base at any time during the battle or travel. In addition, you’ll also take all the resources you’ve accumulated with you, which will be a great advantage if the Crusade is too difficult, and you feel like you can’t complete it. This is useful even if you can complete the raid, but you realize that it will take you too long and your cult members may start to get sick and die from the lack of food or overflowing toilets. This way, you can avoid this and obtain additional resources, which will be a great way out of the situation, especially when your cult is just starting to develop. 2. The Hunger The Hunger is another useful upgrade that will be helpful for Crusaders. It allows you to take food with you to eat between battles. This way, [you can restore your health](https://thenerdstash.com/how-to-heal-in-cult-of-the-lamb/) and get additional buffs if you bring the appropriate food. It is recommended that you cook only the best food from the available ingredients for your character. This way, completing the crusades will be a much easier process, and you can grow your cult faster. 3. Resurrection Resurrection is a great upgrade that will allow you to revive once per battle after dying. This is incredibly useful, especially if you’re fighting a difficult boss and don’t have much of a chance. This upgrade could be the first on the list, if not for one drawback: when resurrecting yourself, you must sacrifice one member of the cult. Because of this, Resurrection is not recommended as the first choice, especially if your cult is small. For the late game, it will be the best advantage, but in the beginning, it is better to choose the upgrades listed above. 4. Darkness Within Darkness Within is the worst upgrade, not only at the beginning but also during the entire game. It should be upgraded last to take advantage of the aforementioned upgrades first. Darkness Within gives you one more extra heart, but it has a Diseased effect. You will receive a diseased heart at the beginning of each of your crusade runs, and its main benefit is to return damage to enemies. This way, anyone who successfully hits you gets damage back. This is good, especially if you’re in a crowd of enemies, but compared to others, it is still weak. Cult of the Lamb is available on the Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles.",
