  "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accepted an invitation to inaugurate a Hindu temple in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi, in February next year, the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha stated.Representatives of the BAPS organisation, led by Swami Ishwarcharandas and Swami Brahmaviharidas, met the Prime Minister at his residence in New Delhi and extended the invitation for the inauguration on February 14, according to a press statement from the Swaminarayan Sanstha.The statement further notes that PM Modi has \"graciously accepted\" the invitation to inaugurate the temple in the Arab country.\"Delighted by this gesture, Prime Minister Modi graciously accepted the invitation, expressing his enthusiastic support for the historic and iconic temple,\" the BAPS Sanstha said.In an almost hour-long meeting, the BAPS delegation discussed the significance of the Abu Dhabi temple for global harmony and Modi's vision for India's spiritual leadership on the global stage, the organisation said.\"The BAPS delegation prayed for the Prime Minister’s health and acknowledged his exceptional global achievements, notably strengthening relationships with the UAE and other Middle Eastern countries,\" and \"Prime Minister Modi shared his personal vision for greater spiritual growth and India’s emergence as a global leader,\" the statement added.Designed to resemble a blossoming lotus flower, the BAPS Sanstha temple will be the largest Hindu temple in the United Arab Emirates.Published By: Ajmal Published On: Dec 29, 2023ALSO READ | Vaishno Devi temple records highest number of pilgrims in a decadeMust Watch",
