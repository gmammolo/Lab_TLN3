  "text": "WESTPORT, Conn., Dec. 29, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HMG Strategy , the World's #1 digital platform for connecting business technology executives to reimagine the enterprise and reshape the business world, is excitedly looking ahead to its 17th consecutive year of growth and success, fueled by its signature events for global technology executives, the successful expansion of its peer-driven Global Advisory Services, its gratitude for community give-back and its incomparable recognition awards program.\n“The unique insights shared in our events and in our Global Advisory Services, the power of our global executive community and value of the HMG platform is second-to-none,” said Hunter Muller, Founder and CEO, HMG Strategy. “Our in-house team is truly amazing, and we are eternally grateful to the top-tier technology executives, speakers, advisory board members, Global Leadership Institute awardees and partners that make our platform the best in the world. We wish everyone good health and success as we look ahead to a safe and brighter 2024.”\nHunter Muller and the HMG Research Team are excited about the strong reception to HMG’s Global CIO & CISO Executive Leadership Alliance (CELA) and Inner Circle advisory services in 2023. Each of these are peer-driven, future-focused executive advisory services that are aimed at helping CIOs, CTOs, CDOs, CISOs and other business technology leaders to lead successfully in the C-suite, in the boardroom and with line-of-business executives.\nUnlike traditional analyst-led research which is typically developed by former executives who are out of touch with the macro-economic issues that are shaping the business landscape and the priorities of the C-suite, HMG’s Global Advisory Services are a distinctive set of peer-focused advisory services that draw off the collective wisdom and real-world insights of actual practitioners – the top global CIOs, CISOs, CTOs, CISOs and business technology executives who are spearheading business and cultural change across their organizations.\n“CIOs, CISOs and other business technology executives in the HMG community are telling us that the analyst model is out of date and isn’t responsive to the ever-changing macro-economic and geo-political climate,” said Muller. “As we’ve seen with our CELA program and other services we produce, the best and most actionable insights come from current technology executives – and that’s what we’re delivering.”\nHMG Strategy’s Global Leadership Services include the following services:\nThe HMG Global CIO & CISO Executive Leadership Alliance (CELA) Service . Launched in 2010, HMG’s CELA service is the industry’s leading peer-to-peer executive leadership community for technology executives to brainstorm together on critical business challenges and to accelerate their careers. The HMG Genius Network . Subscribers to the HMG Genius Service can pose inquiries to domain experts in the HMG community – comprised of 500,000+ CIOs, CISOs, CTOs, CDOs and other business technology executives -- to help them to quickly solve pressing business, technology and sourcing challenges. Issues address under the HMG Genius Network are typically resolved within 24-to-48 hours instead of the weeks it often takes with traditional analyst-led services. The HMG Inner Circle Service . HMG’s Inner Circle Service provides real-world insights from the industry’s top practitioners – the top global CIOs, CISOs, CTOs, CDOs and business technology executives – who are spearheading business and cultural change across their organizations.\nTo learn more about these and other upcoming HMG Advisory Services, contact HMG Strategy Founder and CEO Hunter Muller at hunterm@hmgstrategy.com .\nOne of the components that buoyed HMG Strategy in 2023 was the success of the HMG Innovation Accelerator. Through its partnership with Cyberstarts, the world’s only venture capital firm that’s primarily funded by the industry’s most successful cybersecurity founders, the HMG Innovation Accelerator introduced leading-edge cybersecurity start-ups to the industry’s top CISOs and CIOs, highlighting the unique problems that they solve for their clients and the value that they bring to the market.\nHMG Strategy’s 2023-2024 Global Leadership Institute Awards\nThroughout 2023, HMG Strategy recognized more than 100 premier technology executives who have demonstrated courageous and authentic leadership with their teams to help put their organizations on the fast track to groundbreaking transformation.\nRecipients of HMG Strategy’s 2023 Global Leadership Institute Awards include:\nRoota Almeida , Head of Security Governance, Amazon Stores Bhavani Amirthalingam , EVP, Chief Customer and Technology Officer, Ameren Mike Anderson , Chief Digital and Information Officer, Netskope Chris Andrews , CIO, Unleashed Brands Judith Apshago , Chief Digital Officer, Amtrak Bhupesh Arora , VP & CIO, Magellan Midstream Partners L.P.
