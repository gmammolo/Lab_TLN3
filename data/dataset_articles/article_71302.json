  "text": "Matthew West’s Hope Amid Post-Christmas Blues: ‘God is Still With Us’ By Movieguide® Contributor Christian artist Matthew West shared his remedy for post-Christmas “blues” during a recent podcast episode. To help people remember the eternal hope the holiday brings, he wrote a song that focuses on how Christ’s birth changed the world. “Even on the day after Christmas, the Light of the world has not left us,” West [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GWhwYxjIMk). “This Christmas on our tour, we sang, ‘Away in a Manger, Love Came Near.’ At Christmastime we celebrate that our God loved us enough to come near in the form of sending his only son. And then we would sing a song called, ‘The God Who Stays.’ That is the hope that we have as followers of Christ. That we worship a God that not only came near, but who stays near. Who is with us. Even as Christmas ends. Emmanuel, God is still with us.” West spent his Christmas with his family. “Merry Christmas from the West Family! ‘For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given’ (Isaiah 9:6),'” he posted on Instagram. The singer is also preparing for his latest song, “Don’t Stop Praying,” to drop in January. “DON’T STOP PRAYING 🙏🏻 Available to stream 01.05. Pre-save now at the link in my bio!” West [posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0xIe3apiMg/). “I hope when you hear this song you are reminded that God is listening when you call on His name. The Bible says in James 5:16, ‘The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.’ Your Father is with you. He sees you and He hears you. What are you praying for?” West will be [heading](https://www.matthewwest.com/tour) on tour with Cochren & Co. starting in February. “Join them for a fun night of faith, hope and encouragement on the ‘Don’t Stop Praying Tour,'” K-LOVE posted. Movieguide® previously [reported](https://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/matthew-west-on-how-he-got-started-in-music-a-late-bloomer.html) on West: Christian musician Matthew West recently opened up about how he got started in music during his annual Come Home for Christmas weekend… “My process of learning the guitar—I was actually a bit of a late bloomer musically because I was more focused on sports in school,” West [admitted]. “And when I realized I wasn’t going to be a professional baseball player, I decided to shift my focus and I really just took to music.” “But I never really played an instrument until I was 17, my senior year of high school,” he [said]. “My dad bought me a guitar, and I still have that first guitar. I taught myself how to play basically. I got a poster from Walmart, and it was called ‘The Chord Finder,’ it was basically all of these little numbers, and it showed you where to put your fingers to play different chords.” West added that because he was a freshman in college and didn’t know many people, he stayed in his room and learned to play guitar.",
