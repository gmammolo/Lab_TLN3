  "text": "Bristol Unity Ceremony Ideas For Weddings & Vow Renewals From Top Celebrant\n[Ceremonies With Rachel](/ceremonies-with-rachel/) - Friday, December 29, 2023.\nAh, weddings. Such a beautiful time filled with love, connections and all the good stuff. What more could you ask for? What about an extra element that would take your special day from great to memorably beautiful? With a unity ceremony, it's guaranteed.\nIf you're getting married in South West England, Ceremonies With Rachel is great at putting that extra icing on your wedding cake.\nRachel Branston, a wedding celebrant working in Somerset, Devon, Dorset, Bristol and surrounding areas, offers couples first-rate selections of unity ceremonies for their weddings. At Ceremonies With Rachel, Rachel will help you design personalised wedding ceremonies, offering symbolic rituals such as handfasting, circling, and unity candle lighting that are sure to please you and your new spouse.\nFind out more by visiting\nhttps://ceremonieswithrachel.com/unity-ceremony\nIf you're not familiar with what a unity ceremony is, it's essentially a symbolic means of signifying your marriage. It's a ritual performed during the wedding ceremony to represent unification. It can be secular, religious or historical and may also incorporate your family members to represent the joining of your and your spouse's families.\nThese ceremonies are usually performed after you've exchanged wedding vows and are widely varied. Rituals you can choose from include the Anniversary Capsule, which entails putting together a capsule with mementos from your wedding, photos and love letters that would then be sealed and opened on an anniversary of your choosing.\nAnother ceremonial ritual is the use of unity candles. This practice involves you and your spouse lighting two different candles and then lighting a larger one with your individually lit candles, which symbolizes your new life together as a team. Other rituals include Tree Planting, Wine or Beer Blending and Braiding of the Cross — each holds varying significance unique to your and your partner's beliefs or personalities.\nIf you're planning an outdoor wedding, there are also unity ceremony ideas specific to the open skies. One such ritual, ideal for a beach wedding, is Sand Pouring, where the blending of different coloured sand represents the mixing of personalities or your and your loved one's individual lives merging into one.\nAs an organist and pianist who has played at hundreds of weddings, Rachel also offers you the opportunity to have an original song written about your and your partner's love story. It can be featured in your ceremony, wedding video or played during your first dance. Other than weddings, Ceremonies With Rachel provides services for baby naming, vow renewal, divorce, funerals and more.\nA true celebrant of love, Rachel is committed to providing couples with meaningful ways to celebrate and cement their union on that beautiful day.\nRachel said: “All life’s key events deserve a ceremony reflecting your values, beliefs and personalities. I’m here to help you create and deliver a unique ceremony that is all about you, your family and your friends.”\nAdd that extra oomph to make the most of your union with your soulmate!
