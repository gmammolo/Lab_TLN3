  "text": "2023-12-29 23:41:23 NOTICIACRISTIANA.COM- In Australia, young people from the city of Gold Coastcarried out an evangelistic action, where seven people accepted Jesus, and were baptized. Bas Rodwell, a 22-year-old missionary from, “Youth for Christ”said that around 40 people participated in the event, a program that included Gospel ministries and prayers for the students, according to Guide me. Bas testified that a young man who used crutches, after falling from a four-story building, was healed after praying. “After praying, this man’s ankle and toes slowly began to move, and for the first time since 2007, he regained his movement, and he was ecstatic,” Bas told Revive. A volunteer took the opportunity and spoke to the child about Jesus, and he responded: “Yes, God is real. I want to follow Christ, and be baptized,” he confessed. Another young man narrated his testimony: “Six weeks ago, I was in a car accident, but I came out unharmed, and I thought: “God saved me, and rescued me.”” Baptism While Bas was preaching, and explaining what baptism is about, a group of 15 German backpackers, who were walking through the park, approached him and asked him: “Does anyone here want to give their life to Jesus, repent of their sins, and be baptized like these guys?” Bass said. At that moment, one of the backpackers responded: “Yes, I want to follow Jesus, and be baptized,” he said. Then, around 2:30 in the morning, they baptized the seven children. Drawn to Jesus Bas reported that the young people attend church and are disciplined. Through his testimony, other students are drawn to Jesus. “One of the boys who was baptized is my friend. He looks very different. My other friend and I want to know what this is, and we want to get baptized too, because we want what he has now,” said the young man. “Discipleship is really where my heart is. We can go out on the street, and have people say a prayer, and that’s a seed, and God can use it in the future, but I really want to see disciples being made, and people following Jesus, and their lives changing. ”Bas concluded.
