  "text": "25-year-old gig worker killed in Hyderabad bike-bus crash, driver arrested\nA 25-year-old Zepto delivery executive was killed in a road accident in Mehdipatnam, Hyderabad, after a private bus hit and ran over his two-wheeler. The incident was captured on CCTV, and the bus driver was arrested.\nA 25-year-old delivery executive working with quick-commerce platform, Zepto, was killed on the spot in a road accident in Hyderabad on Monday night.\nAccording to police, the incident occurred when the victim was riding his two-wheeler under the limits of Mehdipatnam police station.\nA private travel bus belonging to Ganesh Travels allegedly hit the motorcycle and ran over the rider, causing fatal injuries.\nFollowing the incident, Mehdipatnam police registered a case and took the bus driver into custody. The driver was later arrested as part of the investigation. The victim’s body was shifted to a government hospital for post-mortem examination.\nPolice said further investigation was underway to determine the exact circumstances leading to the accident, including whether overspeeding or negligence was involved.\nThe Telangana Gig and Platform Workers’ Union (TGPWU) mourned the death of the 25-year-old Zepto delivery executive who was on duty at the time of the crash in Hyderabad.\nTGPWU founder-president Shaik Salauddin flagged concerns over delivery timelines followed by platform companies and the lack of timely support for injured or deceased gig workers.\nQuestioning the disparity in response, he said, “10-minute food and grocery deliveries start on time. Rs 100-crore speed projects start on time. But when a worker crashes on the road, insurance and compensation never start on time. Why?” He also sought immediate action to ensure accident insurance and accountability for working conditions faced by gig workers.",
