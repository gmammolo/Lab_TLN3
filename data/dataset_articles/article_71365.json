Sign in with Google Continue with Facebook Login using other methods Popular Indian actor Akshay Kumar was moved by Indian cricketer Shikhar Dhawan's emotional post on his son Zoravar's birthday.\nDhawan had posted a heartfelt message on Tuesday, December 26, wishing his son on his ninth birthday. He disclosed in the message that he hasn't seen his son for a year now.\nIt is worth mentioning that Dhawan and his ex-wife, Ayesha Mukherjee, got divorced earlier this year in October, and Zoravar has been living with his mother in Australia. Reacting to Dhawan's post, Akshay Kumar wrote in his Instagram story:\n\"Really moved to see this post. As a father, I know that nothing is more painful than not being able to see or meet your child. Hausla rakh Shikhar (Keep faith, Shikhar)... millions of us are praying for you to meet your son soon. God bless.\" Akshay Kumar's Instagram story for Shikhar Dhawan. On the cricketing front, Shikhar Dhawan has lost his place in the Indian team following the emergence of young openers Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal .
