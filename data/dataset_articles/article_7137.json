  "text": "- By Akansha Pandey\n- Thu, 08 Jan 2026 11:07 AM (IST)\n- Source:Jagran News Network\nA major theft incident came to light on Thursday morning aboard the 15623 Down Kamakhya Express, travelling from Jodhpur to Kamakhya. At around 4:30 am near Hardas Bigha station, unidentified miscreants simultaneously targeted passengers in four different coaches. According to information, the incident occurred in coaches B-1, B-6, A-1, and A-2. It has been confirmed that the purses and belongings of at least four passengers travelling in these coaches were stolen.\nThieves Flee After Chain Pulling\nPassengers stated that most people were fast asleep at the time, which the thieves took advantage of. After stealing purses and other valuables, the culprits pulled the emergency chain to stop the train and fled, causing panic among the passengers. It is reported that the train's next stop after Patna is New Barauni station, but the culprits had already carried out the theft and escaped before the train reached it.\nPassenger Complaint And RPF Response\nPassanger Kamlesh Kumar, travelling from Jodhpur to Kamakhya, was the first to report the incident through Rail Madad. According to the affected passenger, the stolen purse contained cash along with important documents and personal belongings. The complaint subsequently reached the RPF (Railway Protection Force). Upon being informed of the incident, the RPF immediately took action and launched an investigation.\nALSO READ: UP: Friends Turn Bike Into Bonfire After Liquor Party In Etawah; Settle Dispute For Rs 25,000\nInvestigation And Search For Suspects\nThe RPF stated that an investigation is underway based on the online complaint.

Furthermore, the search for suspects has been intensified based on the location of the chain-pulling incident.\nSafety Concerns And Demand For Security\nAn atmosphere of panic prevails among passengers following the incident. Passengers have alleged that security on the train was inadequate and that such incidents are on the rise due to a lack of surveillance during the night. They have demanded that the railway administration enhance security on trains during the night, intensify patrols, and keep a watch on suspicious activities. These recurring theft incidents have once again raised serious questions about the safety of rail passengers.\nALSO READ: Gold, Silver Prices Continue Losing Streak; Check Latest 24k, 22K Gold Rates Today In India",
