  "text": "2023-12-29 20:30:00 Sivagiri Pilgrimage Welcomes Thousands of Devotees Sivagiri, a sacred place surrounded by Peetashobha and blessed with Guru Narayana mantras, is bustling with activity as thousands of pilgrims have been arriving for the past two weeks. The pilgrimage committee and volunteers are all set to welcome the devotees arriving from various parts of the state. Volunteers will be providing necessary assistance for darshan and offering offerings at Saradamath, Vaidikamatha, Rickshaw Mandapam, Bodhanandaswamy Samadhi Mandapam, and Mahasamadhi Mandira. To ensure smooth facilitation, there is also police service and additional staff at the offering counters. Special stalls for Sivagiri Karma Yoga have been set up for pilgrims to keep their belongings and footwear. Tickets for the offerings are available at the counters of Federal Bank, and a special inquiry counter has been established. The local community has also shown great enthusiasm in providing necessary facilities and arranging food and accommodation for the pilgrims, including foreigners who have come as guests during the pilgrimage days. During the pilgrimage days, devotees can visit Mahasamadhi and Saradamath from 5 am to 12 pm and participate in evening lamp worship and community prayer from 6 to 7 pm. Various pujas and offerings are also available, along with medical services from Sivagiri Sreenarayana Medical Mission, Govt. Homeopathy, Allopathy, and Ayurvedic emergency departments. In order to adhere to the green protocol, the use of plastic is strictly prohibited in and around Sivagiri. For any assistance, a helpline has been set up with contact numbers for the Sivagiri Math office, Pilgrimage Committee, and accommodation committee. As the pilgrimage season kicks off, Sivagiri is ready to embrace the multitude of devotees with open arms. #Sivagiri #KERALA #GENERAL #flow #pilgrims",
