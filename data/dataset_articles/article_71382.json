The award recognises her services to palliative care and volunteering in Spain having spent some 30 years building this ground breaking organisation alongside the late Joan Hunt OBE.\nRecognising Susan Hannam Mrs Hannam, who lives in Benalmadena and has dedicated her life to accompanying patients in their last moments, has played an essential role in the Cudeca Foundation for decades.\nMost Read on Euro Weekly News Foreign residents support Estepona café owner Fuengirola New Year's Eve Party The most famous cars of the cinema At Cudeca, which supports both patients and their loved ones and has treated over 1,200 people this year, Mrs Hannam has taken on a variety of roles, from developing their nursing palliative home care service, to training volunteers and boosting the charity’s shops.\nThe British Ambassador to Spain, Hugh Elliott, said: “Susan’s work in palliative care with Cudeca started over thirty years ago and has made a difference to the communities in which the charity is so active.

Thanks to the wonderful team of medical palliative specialists along with the very special team of volunteers. Our aim is to give life to the days of patients with a special kind of care”.\nOthers recognised In addition to Mrs Hannam, three other British residents in Spain have been named in the New Year Honours list 2024:\nAn MBE (Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) to Mrs Margery Anne Taylor, District Treasurer and District Training Officer, Royal British Legion, Spain South. ‘For services to Veterans in Spain.’\nA BEM (British Empire Medal) to Mr Philip David Brown.
