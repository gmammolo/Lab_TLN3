  "text": "> FRIENDSHIP — More than a ton of no-longer-used Bibles, Sunday school materials and other Christian study resources are on the way to pastors and missionaries in other countries as a result of a Friendship churches initiative.\nThe Traveling Chapel, a ministry of PhotosforSouls.com of Alfred, has been the depository for the items since October as the churches joined together to promote the outreach within the broader community.\nThe replica of a church has been parked on a small trailer on the front lawn of the Friendship Mission House, site of the former St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church at 30 E. Main St., and became an integral part of activities around A Friendship Christmas — Celebrating the True Message of Christmas hosted at various churches during December.\nDonors contributed 2,206 pounds, or more than 1.1 tons, of materials to the cause, according to Photos for Souls, raising the organization’s total collections are various locations in the Southern Tier of New York and northwestern Pennsylvania to more than 20 tons since the ongoing project started a little over two years ago.\nSuch materials are sought by pastors and missionaries in many countries which have little or no opportunity to obtain such items.\nPhotos for Souls also maintains a website of photographs and encouragement, with individuals or organizations being able to download the artwork, a large portion of which is of area and regional views, for their own purposes without any cost.\nA Friendship Christmas was initiated by community churches this year “to return the focus of the holiday to Christ’s birth.”\nActivities, many of them new, included a lighted nativity scene, along with The Chapel, on the mission house property, Sunday night Christmas caroling near the center of town, a Christmas concert by children and youth, along with some adult choral and instrumental participants, a gingerbread house competition, two Christmas Eve services, and a New Year’s Eve Family Celebration.\nThe churches expect to build upon these activities next year as they seek to expand upon their year-round efforts to serve the needs of children, youth, adults and families in the broader Friendship area.\nIn recent months, the group has hosted jointly a community picnic, a back to school prayer gathering, which has become a monthly event, several joint Christian holiday activities and a family day celebration and wellness fair. They also have supported activities hosted by individual churches.\nThe What God is Doing in Friendship monthly newsletter, which is distributed to church attendees and the public, has been developed, along with a group Facebook page by the same name.\nChurches also are seeking to engage a volunteer, or part-time or full-time children, youth and families ministries director for work within the community.\nFurther information about The Chapel and the Photos for Souls Christian nonprofit ministry, including a video that shows construction of the structure and its use, is available at https://bit.ly/3O2t208 .\nUpdates and reports about joint initiatives of the Friendship churches are available on the What God is Doing in Friendship group Facebook page or from Allegany Hope, the joint ministries facilitator, at AlleganyHopeWNY@outlook.com or (585) 664-9989.",
