  "text": "Read Previous Post\nHoly Family Kindergartners Visit the Fraternity Poor of Jesus Christ LA Religious Community\nRecently, Holy Family School (HFS) Kindergarten students meet with Friar Michael and Friar Lucaelo of the Fraternity Poor of Jesus Christ LA religious community to learn about their ministry. This month, the Little Kinder Knights put the Virtue of Generosity into action by making over 200 sandwiches for the Friars ministry to be distributed to those in need.\nAt Holy Family, students learn that as disciples of Jesus Christ, GENEROSITY comes from the heart, so it is not how big the gift is that matters, but rather the value it has to the person who gave it. Christ lived it. He was always giving of his time, listening, and helping others.\n“During this season of Advent and Christmas, as everyone prepare for the birth of the Lord, HFS remind its students to be thankful for all the beautiful gifts God has given us and, in turn, to give to those less fortunate. To enjoy the time we are blessed with when gathering with family and friends”.\nIf you would like to learn more about the Poor of Jesus Christ LA religious community, visit\nhttps://pjcfriars.org.\nHoly Family Catholic School instills Christian values and Catholic principles in students through the Gospel message of Jesus Christ; Faith, Community, Service and Excellence.\nHoly Family School, 1301 Rollin St., South Pasadena, (626) 799-4354 or visit\nschool.holyfamily.org.",
