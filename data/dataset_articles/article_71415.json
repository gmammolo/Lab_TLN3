  "text": "A woman who “died” in a [coma ](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/hospital)says she was brought back to Earth by a [psychic ](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/asparagus-psychic-who-predicted-queens-31770154)pal to “finish her mission”. Kirsty Bortoft was found unresponsive on the sofa by her husband Stu when they were preparing to go out on a date together on January 29, 2021. After being rushed to hospital, medics told her loved ones she had a 6% chance of survival. But despite all the odds, the 49-year-old managed to pull through and now has revealed what she found while she was seemingly gone. She said: “The first night was crucial and it wasn’t looking good, where Stu was told he should prepare for me not making it – but he wasn’t having any of it.” READ MORE: [Prince Harry and Meghan will divorce and this is where kids will go, says psychic](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/psychics-predict-harry-meghan-divorce-31655421) For the latest news and updates from the Royal Family, click [here](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/royal-family). The mum of three battled through multiple cardiac arrests and after her heart stopped beating for 40 minutes, she was placed into a medically-induced coma. Kirsty continued: “No one at this point knew what was going on apart from my immediate family, but my psychic friend got in touch with my sister and asked what was going on. She said my spirit was in her front room and I was asking her to write lists for my boys and dad. “I told [my friend] that my body was breaking down and I didn’t think I could back get into it, but she got stern with me and told me to go back. Meanwhile, in the hospital, my family were being told to prepare themselves for the end.” When the decision was made to bring her back from the coma, Kirsty immediately asked for Stu. Her lungs and heart were found to have barely any damage on scans just weeks later, only adding to the miracle. Kirsty said: “I recall upon finally coming back in to my body, that I knew exactly what I needed to do to heal, like a download of information. I realised you don’t die, only your body moves on and that my mission here wasn’t over yet. I told the doctor I healed my lungs and he asked how, so I shared my story. I left feeling elated and excited about my recovery.” For the latest breaking news from the Royal Family and stories from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletter by clicking [here](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/).",
