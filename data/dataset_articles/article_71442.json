  "text": "Myron C. Campbell, 87, moved to Heaven at 10 p.m. Thursday, Dec. 28, 2023, while at his home in Penns Creek, surrounded by his family while singing praise hymns to God, our Loving Heavenly Father.\nHe was born Nov. 9, 1936, in Hutchinson, Kansas, a son of the late John and Florence (Merkle) Campbell. He was a 1955 graduate of the Eastern Pilgrim College Academy and then graduated from their college in 1960. He met and married his sweetheart from college, the former Celestia Walz, who survives, on July 13, 1957.\nMyron was a very hard worker with a witty sense of humor. He enjoyed hunting and antiquing in his spare time. He spent many summers on his grandfather's Lost Creek Ranch in Nebraska where he learned a good work ethic that continued throughout his life. He worked at General Electric before becoming a pastor for 27 years in the Pilgrim Holiness Church which later merged to become the Wesleyan Church. Afterwards, he was employed as the caretaker of God's Holiness Grove Campground in Selinsgrove while working at SEDA-COG until his retirement. After retirement, he served as an interim pastor for the White Springs Evangelical Church in White Springs, Pa. and the Saint Peter's Evangelical Church in Freeburg, Pa. He also did a chaplaincy for the Penns Creek Community Center.\nMyron was a faithful husband, father, grandfather, pastor, and dedicated Christian who read his Bible and prayed daily, a man of God in word and deed. He instilled a heart for God and people in us as children through many activities including being a missionary in Haiti from 1970 to 1974. He, his brother and father held an evangelistic campaign in Guyana, Suriname and Trinidad prior to embarking on his own missionary journey.\nSurviving in addition to his wife of 66 years, are two daughters and spouses, Crystal and Scott Shambach and Starla and Wesley Wagner, both of Middleburg; one son, Ned Campbell of Selinsgrove; as well as five grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren. Also surviving is one foster daughter, Emily Noll of Port Matilda; three grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.\nMyron was preceded in death by two brothers, Paul and Robert Campbell; as well as one sister, Betty Argot.\nFamily and friends are welcome to a viewing from 6 to 8 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 2, at Port Ann Wesleyan Church where he attended as a member, 2856 Troxelville Road, Middleburg. A viewing will again be held Wednesday, Jan. 3 at 1 p.m. prior to the funeral service at 2 p.m. Officiating pastors will be Rev. Jason A. Shambach (grandson) and Pastor Brandon R. Kuhns (grandson-in-law).\nInterment will be in Penns Creek Union Cemetery.\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial donations are requested to be made to Port Ann Wesleyan Church.\nArrangements are by the Hummel Funeral Home, 574 Hill St., Middleburg.\nIn Memory of MyronWhen MyronHow MyronWhen MyronHow Myron\n tree?oId=30213852&source=TRR_FT_V1&cn=Obituaries&bn=AdPerfect+- tree?oId=30213852&source=TRR_FT_V1&cn=Obituaries&bn=AdPerfect+- ",
