  "text": "Trinity Audioplayer ready...\nAn unfortunate, but all too common an occurrence from which this person will hopefully learn.\nThis newspaper and other media outlets reported that on New Year’s Eve day, a 31-year-old Pelham, N.H., woman required hospitalization after losing control of a rental snowmobile on a remote trail in Stratford, just north of Berlin, N.H.\nNew Hampshire Fish and Game said medical crews from Groveton and Stratford responded to the West Side Road Trail at about 4:20 p.m., after another rider came upon the crash, found the injured rider, identified as Jennifer Jasinski, and called 911.\nThe nearest conservation officer was on patrol in Dixville — some 30 miles distant — and met with the victim later at the hospital due to the extended response time.\nAuthorities said an investigation determined Jasinski lost control while navigating a downhill, right-hand turn. The snowmobile left the trail, struck a tree, and ejected her over an embankment.\nJasinski, who sustained an undetermined lower leg injury, was evacuated by medical crews and transported to Weeks Medical Center in Lancaster, N.H., for treatment.\nFish and Game investigators determined that Jasinski had little to no prior snowmobiling experience, calling that the primary factor in the crash.\nIf the circumstances of this accident sound eerily familiar, you’d be correct.\nOther serious and fatal snowmobile accidents occurred in that same area last winter involving local residents.\nFortunately, in this case, we trust the victim will fully recover from her injuries.\nWith snowmobiles, much like ice safety on our lakes and ponds, traversing snow-covered trails comes with a host of warnings and regulations designed to minimize serious injury or death.\nPrimary among them — knowing if you’re capable of handling such a powerful machine.\nSeveral disturbing accidents, including one that caused the death of a Littleton woman last January, should have served as a somber reminder of the risks involved when taking part in this winter pastime.\nIn that Jan. 23 accident, officials from New Hampshire Fish and Game identified the victim as Stacey McGarry, 56, who was killed after her rental snowmobile struck a rock, sending the vehicle airborne.\nInvestigators at the crash scene determined that McGarry — accompanied by a passenger — failed to make a right turn on the trail, sending the snowmobile into a tree, causing the fatal injury, officials said.\nOfficials said they believe the victim had limited or no previous snowmobile experience.\nNo or limited experience operating a snowmobile appears to be a common thread.\nTwo accidents in February — one fatal — supported that conclusion.\nAccording to MassLive, New Hampshire Fish and Game announced on Feb. 16 that a Central Massachusetts woman died in a snowmobile accident in Milan, N.H.\nThe crash near the Berlin border killed 39-year-old North Brookfield, Mass., resident Shawnee Hollis, the department said in a press release, which said inexperience with snowmobiles was “a leading factor” in the crash.\nThe department said Hollis failed to navigate a downhill left turn and hit a tree 13 feet off the right side of the trail.\nAuthorities responded to the crash around 4:30 p.m., after having hiked a considerable distance to reach the crash site, the department said. First responders tried to have Hollis flown to a hospital, but were unable to secure transport.\nShe was eventually brought by ambulance to Androscoggin Valley Hospital in Berlin, the department said.\nShe was then transferred to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, where she died the next day.\nAnd earlier in February, 41-year-old Methuen resident Eloara Machado was so severely injured when she crashed in Milan that she had to be airlifted to a hospital.\nIt was her first time riding a snowmobile, officials said, with inexperience being the primary cause of the crash.\nMcGarry and Machado were both operating rented snowmobiles.\nIt’s not a coincidence that officials cited inexperience as the probable cause in these accidents.\nIt’s imperative that a novice or inexperienced snowmobiler become accustomed to the machinery they’re operating before taking it on any trail.\nRenting a snowmobile removes familiarity from the equation. It’s doubly problematic if the operator’s new to this outdoor activity.\nIt also breaks several of N.H. Fish and Game’s basic safety guidelines, which include:\n• Know your abilities to ride and do not exceed those levels.\n• Always ride at a speed that’s reasonable and prudent for the existing conditions. If you cannot control your machine, you’re riding too fast, no matter the posted speed limit.\n• Know the area you’re riding in. Be aware of potential hazards, such as washouts and other changing trail characteristics. Get a map of the trails and talk to local riders.\n• Use common sense when riding. Be prepared; carry a first aid and survival kit. Take along some spare plugs and tools that may not be in the machine’s tool kit.\n• Let someone know where you will be riding and when you plan on returning.\n• And of course, no one should take a snowmobile out for a spin while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\nWe hope Jennifer Jasinski realizes how fortunate she was to have avoided a far worse fate.\nDon’t let inexperience or carelessness turn your snowmobiling outing into a tragedy.",
