  "text": "Are you aware that a single decision can transform your entire life? Our Christian Character Count series supporters can attest to this truth. It all begins with Christ’s first instruction — “Repent” — which embodies the Christ-like trait of humility (Matthew 4:17). By making small changes, one after the other, we can embody the trait of flexibility derived from Christ’s final command, “Make Disciples.” This enables us to move beyond our limitations and reach greater heights in who we are and what we do. It’s when we stand in this mature position in life that Christian Character Counts. In the year 2023, we unveiled the 49 traits of Christ, which are widely considered to be the ultimate embodiment of personhood, the holy grail of personhood, if you will. These traits are considered to be indispensable for navigating the challenges of a world that is marred by sin and brokenness. Without these traits, it is impossible to make sense of life, and our actions may be misguided and harmful. When we choose to ignore the divine reality or follow our own selfish desires, we create more problems for ourselves and others. Learning and applying the teachings and traits of Christ can bring you many benefits and blessings. However, if you choose not to follow these teachings, it can lead to many negative consequences, such as a lack of direction, strained relationships, and moral compromises. The biggest problem is the spiritual disconnect that occurs. The commands and their benefits are based on the personal connection you have with Christ. It is through this connection that we can deepen our relationship with God and ultimately manifest a good life through His Spirit. Disregarding these traits guarantees a spiritual disconnect in life. By adopting the qualities of Christ and allowing them to shape our character, we can lead meaningful and fulfilling lives that honor God and benefit those around us, whatever the circumstances, situation, or relationship. Jesus himself provides us with the key to developing and preserving these qualities when he says, “Every man who knows my commandments and obeys them is the man who really loves me, and every man who really loves me will himself be loved by my Father, and I too will love him and make myself known to him” (John 14:21 [Phillips]). As we approach the conclusion of the Christian Character Counts Series for the year 2023, I would like to take a moment to encourage you to thoughtfully contemplate all that has been shared during our time together. The teachings and traits we have explored throughout this series have the potential to be genuinely transformative, and I hope that you have been inspired and encouraged to implement them in your daily life. Now is the time to take action and put these valuable lessons into practice so that we may honor God and manifest a life that is guided by His Spirit. Let us embrace this opportunity to grow faithfully and become more Christlike where Christian Character Counts! With Great LOVE, Drake Hunter is the Senior Pastor at Elevating Life Church in Fort Morgan and the author of “Wonderfully Weird Living.”",
