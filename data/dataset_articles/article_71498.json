  "text": "As we approach the New Year, 2024 , in the year of our Lord, we yearn for our clean slate, clean heart, fresh start.\nAs the Psalmist yearns:\nGrant us a heart of repentance so we may confess our sins to be washed and made clean. Grant us the desire to know You more in the New Year through the Spirit teaching us as we study Your Word.\nWe thank You, Father, for the faith of our founding fathers, who sacrificed for a cause greater than themselves.\nMay we reflect the dark days of the American Revolution, when wrong seemed so strong. Yet, George Washington’s cruiser flew a flag to remind themselves where their help came from:\nWe thank You for George Washington, who set a high bar as the first president as well as for those in government:\nMay we remember who we are and stand of the sure foundation of the Promises in Scripture.\nThis season of celebration of the New Year, may we, the people, turn to God with all our heart and appeal to Heaven for deliverance:\n* Reveal all political machinations that have been concealed.\n* Deliver us from satanic puppets that are destroying our nation and our people.\n* Vindicate and restore President Trump as well as thwart all schemes against him.\n* Vindicate and release all J6 political prisoners and grant them justice.\n* Convict our hearts and bring us to repentance and salvation and life eternal.\n* Spark revival, renewal, restoration, and healing in our land.\nAnd may we continue, without ceasing….:\nIn Jesus Name,\nAmen\nG ive thanks to the LORD,\nfor He is good;\nHis love endures forever.\nPsalm 118:1 (NIV)\nKeep praying for America",
