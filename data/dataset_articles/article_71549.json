If anyone loves the world, the Father’s love isn’t in him.\n16 For all that is in the world?the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life?isn’t the Father’s, but is the world’s.\n17 The world is passing away with its lusts, but he who does God’s will remains forever.\n-----\n* The World English Bible\nhttp://ebible.org/web/\n◇ Daily Mass Reading Podcast For December 30, 2023\nhttps://bible.usccb.org/podcasts/audio/daily-mass-reading-podcast-december-30-2023\n◇ Daily Readings December 30, 2023\nhttp://www.usccb.org/bible/readings/123023.cfm\n◇ Abiding Radio Instrumental (BGM)\nhttps://www.abidingradio.org/radio/instrumental\n◇ Today's Bible Story\nhttp://todaysbiblestory.seesaa.net/\n-----",
