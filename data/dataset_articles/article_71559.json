Ferdinand Alexander, William Vincent, and Joseph Simon—the President arrived at 6:50 a.m. and received military honors to kick off a short commemorative ceremony at the Rizal Park in Manila.\nPresident Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. joins the nation in paying tribute to the national hero in a ceremony at Rizal Park, City of Manila, on Saturday, December 30, 2023, in observance of the 127th anniversary of the martyrdom of Dr. Jose P. Rizal. Joining the Chief Executive in the occasion are NHCP Chairman Emmanuel Calairo and Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief of Staff General Romeo Brawner Jr. PHOTO BY: RENE H.
