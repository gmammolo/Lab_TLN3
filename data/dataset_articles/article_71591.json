  "text": "God speaks to people but we must tune in Published 11:00 pm Friday, December 29, 2023 From the writings of the Rev. Billy Graham Dear Rev. Graham: Every Jan. 1 I feel defeated and disconnected to God, who seems far off. How can I really turn over a new leaf? – N.L. Dear N.L.: In the early 20th century, radio was just coming of age. Families gathered around a box tuning dials in an effort to establish contact with the unseen transmitter. In time, a far distant sound would suddenly break through; a voice could be heard loud and clear – listeners had successfully tuned in! God speaks to people but we must tune in. He reveals how we can find Him. The key is having a line of communication. God has made this possible; we can know Him as a personal Lord and Savior and speak to Him through prayer at any time. What God established between Himself and mankind is seen clearly in the coming of Jesus and through His Word – the Bible. We can find a new dimension of living. God sent forth His message of love through the birth of the One who forgives sin and the One who redeems sinful hearts – the Savior of the world. Many people believe that they know God because they celebrate the coming of His Son at Christmas, but we must be willing to submit to Christ by confessing our sin, receiving the free gift that He offers – His forgiveness – and turning our lives over to Him. A brand-new year is a wonderful time to say yes to Jesus Christ, turn over a new leaf, and follow Him. Tune in to God through prayer and the study of Scripture, which produces an outflowing of grace and power. The Bible says, “Now is the accepted time” (2 Corinthians 6:2, NKJV). Don’t put it off. Don’t say, “I’ll think about it, or I’ll do it tomorrow.” Do it right now. At this moment, say yes to Jesus Christ. ———— (This column is based on the words and writings of the late Rev. Billy Graham.)",
