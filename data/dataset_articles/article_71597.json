  "text": "Christmas: Church, stakeholders celebrate persons with disabilities in Lagos The Founder of lnner Eyes Foundation, Ambassador Kelly Blind, has appealed to the government and stakeholders to address the needs of persons living with disabilities. He made the call at an International Disability Day for Christ held at the Elevation Church, Lekki, Lagos. The visually-impaired and human rights activist lamented that over 21 million persons with disabilities were neglected, cheated and abandoned in government’s programmes and policies. He, therefore, urged all stakeholders to ensure that fundamental human rights of persons with disabilities were not excluded from all facets. Global Lead Pastor, The Elevation Church, Godman Akinlabi, disclosed that the church in its capacity, was reaching out to the less-privileged, including the virtually impaired in different projects through scholarships, medical treatment empowerment and training. Another visually impaired man, Mr Richard Okoroafor, who has been blind for 32 years, said they were not beggars. He lamented that they were also faced with Nigeria’s economic challenges. “ We are very hard working and productive,” he said.Ambassador and Chairman 7-Star lnter-Global Property, Moses Chukwuma Ezenwaka, urged the group to support these special persons. He advised parents, families and caregivers to show more love and care, describing the gesture as life-saving, despite these difficult times.He advocated that persons with disabilities should be empowered and afforded equal opportunities to participate in the society. Chief Executive Officer Leadway Property Ltd, Ambassador Ugo Kelechi said: “We need collective efforts assist these special people. No person should be left out our circle.” Resident Pastor, Debo Omotunde, promised to support and put smiles on the faces of special persons and the vulnerable in Lagos State. — Get the latest news delivered straight to your inbox every day of the week.
