ANTARA/Sean Filo Muhamad Jakarta (ANTARA) - Around 58,000 buildings were damaged by a hydrometeorological disaster in Aceh Tamiang, Aceh, the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) reported on Thursday.\n“Analysis from BRIN shows roughly 58,000 buildings were potentially affected,” said Joko Widodo, head of BRIN’s Disaster Mitigation Task Force, during an online seminar.\nThe figure comes from satellite imagery mapping conducted by BRIN’s disaster team, which carefully assessed conditions on the ground.\n“If we may say so, Aceh Tamiang can be considered 90 percent affected,” Widodo said, noting the severity of the floods.\nRelated news: Danantara expedites construction of hundreds Huntara in Aceh Tamiang\nHe added that the data requires further validation, as the methodology differs from that used by other agencies.\nHowever, the information, available at https://spectra.brin.go.id\n, can serve as a reference for stakeholders rebuilding disaster-affected areas in Sumatra.\nBRIN has also shared the data with the Ministry of National Development Planning (Bappenas) to support targeted decision-making.\nWidodo highlighted the potential for engineering measures to build barriers to prevent future overflow from the Tamiang River.\n“The situation in Aceh Tamiang is very concerning. Many houses with elevated floors and foundations were completely swept away,” he said.\n“There were no walls, no roofs, furniture destroyed. These cases are widespread across a very large area,” Widodo added, emphasizing the disaster’s scale.\nRelated news: Indonesia deploys special task force to speed up Aceh flood recovery\nTranslator: Sean, Kenzu\nEditor: Rahmad Nasution\nCopyright © ANTARA 2026",
