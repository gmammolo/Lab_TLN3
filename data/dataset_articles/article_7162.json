  "text": "Snow and ice warnings in place for southern counties as Ireland braces for Storm Goretti\nForecasters have warned of hazardous travelling conditions, spot flooding and icy patches\nMet Éireann has issued a snow and rain warning for four counties for today, with Storm Goretti set to bring rainfall and possibly snow across Ireland.\nFour southern counties – Cork, Kerry, Waterford and Wexford – will be the most affected by the storm, with warnings in place from midday until 8pm today.\nForecasters have warned of hazardous travelling conditions, spot flooding, poor visibility and icy patches.\nStorm Goretti is set to bring rain, which will be heavy at times, and will likely turn to sleet and snow in places in the afternoon, particularly at higher ground.\nMet Éireann forecaster Rebecca Cantwell said Storm Goretti is going to move eastwards across the south of Ireland today.\n“We’ve got a warning out for that for southern counties, so Kerry across to Wexford. It’s a yellow-level snow and rain warning,” she said.\nThe storm will also bring rainfall over much of the country, apart from Ulster, which should stay mainly dry.\n“There will be rainfall associated with the storm, but it is going to be heaviest along those southern counties,” Ms Cantwell said.\nThe storm will move off fairly quickly, she added, and is not expected to have “too many impacts”, but the rainfall will be heaviest along the southern coast.\n“It will move into the south-west in the morning, moving up across the country through the afternoon, but quickly clearing off eastwards in the late afternoon and evening,” she said.\n“We expect some heavy rain to be brought along the south coast as a result of that storm, and some of that may turn to sleet and snow.\n“This is mainly going to be over higher ground. But a little bit of sleet might make its way to lower elevations as well.”\nMs Cantwell said overnight temperatures will drop to below freezing over the coming days. Lowest temperatures tonight will generally range between -2 and 2C.\nIreland is also bracing for further cold temperatures tomorrow and Saturday night, with -2C and -3C overnight temperatures possible.\n“We can expect some frost and maybe some ice where there has been rainfall, and then through Friday and Saturday we can expect showers,” Ms Cantwell said.\n“There’s going to be a lot of dry weather overall, with showers moving into the west and the north-west. Some of those over higher ground may turn into sleet, but generally we’re looking at rain showers in most other areas.\n“Come Sunday, we can expect rainfall across much of the country, with a band of rain moving in and becoming widespread through the day.”",
