  "text": "Rachel Branston of Ceremonies With Rachel (07875 417476) has updated her celebrant services to provide unity ceremonies for weddings in South West England.\nBristol, United Kingdom - December 29, 2023 —\nRachel Branston, a wedding celebrant in Somerset, England, announced that she is now offering couples a selection of unity ceremonies for their weddings. Branston helps couples design personalised wedding ceremonies and offers symbolic rituals such as handfasting, circling and unity candle lighting.\nFor more information, visit https://ceremonieswithrachel.com/unity-ceremony\nRachel Branston is a wedding celebrant working in Somerset, Devon, Dorset, Bristol and surrounding areas. Following the update, she aims to provide individuals getting married in South West England with a symbolic means of signifying their marriage with a unity ceremony.\nA unity ceremony is a ritual performed during a wedding ceremony to represent unification. It can be secular, religious or historical and may also incorporate family members to represent the joining of the couple’s families.\nThese ceremonies are usually performed after exchanging wedding vows and are widely varied. Rituals that couples can choose from include the Anniversary Capsule, which entails putting together a capsule with mementoes from the wedding, photos and love letters that would then be sealed and opened on an anniversary of the couple’s choosing.\nAnother ceremonial ritual is the use of unity candles. This practice involves the couple lighting two different candles and then lighting a larger one with their individually lit candles, which symbolizes their new life together as a team. Other rituals include Tree Planting, Wine or Beer Blending and Braiding of the Cross — each holds varying significance unique to the couple’s beliefs or personalities.\nFor those planning an outdoor wedding, there are also unity ceremony ideas specific to the outdoors. One such ritual, ideal for a beach wedding, is Sand Pouring, where the blending of different coloured sand represents the mixing of personalities or the couple’s individual lives merging into one.\nAs an organist and pianist who has played at hundreds of weddings, Branston also offers couples the opportunity to have an original song written about their love story and featured in their ceremony, wedding video or played during their first dance. Other than weddings, Ceremonies With Rachel provides services for baby naming, vow renewal, divorce celebration, funerals and more.\nRachel Branston said: “All life’s key events deserve a ceremony reflecting your values, beliefs and personalities. I’m here to help you create and deliver a unique ceremony that is all about you, your family and your friends.”\nGo to https://ceremonieswithrachel.com for details.\n Rachel Branston\n Ceremonies With Rachel\nAddress: Highfields, The Wrangle Compton Martin, Bristol, England BS40 6LB, United Kingdom\nWebsite: https://www.ceremonieswithrachel.com\nSource: PressCable\nRelease ID: 89117592\nShould you identify any discrepancies, concerns, or inaccuracies in the content provided in this press release or require assistance with a press release takedown, we strongly urge you to notify us promptly by contacting responsive team is committed to addressing your concerns within 8 hours by taking necessary actions to resolve identified issues diligently or guiding you through the necessary steps for removal.
