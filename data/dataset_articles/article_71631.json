  "text": "Realised souls would rather blame themselves for their faulty deeds It is a faulty instinct. Let us understand what happens. We are suddenly hit by some trouble or are faced with a problem. Why did it happen to me? I was trying to live a normal life, not harming anyone. Why this punishment? We think like this. However, our thinking is faulty because we are unable to see the big picture. What is the big picture? It is to see any situation in its totality. We get punished because punishment has become due to bad acts done earlier. These could be even from past lives, which have come to fruition now. An understanding of the ‘Karmaphala Principle’ is required. We are forever doing acts with our bodies, minds and words. They all result in phalas, i.e. good and bad fruits. And their period and type of rewards and punishments are determined by divine authority under the superintendence of God, (The Bhagavad-Geeta 9.10), who has set the rules for such implementation. Essentially, they are based on dharma (sound moral principles) and justice. Whatever happens to us is essentially due to our good and bad acts. There is another factor in our woes. This earth planet is a place of misery (dukhalaya – 8.15), which has three types of pains. They are: what we give ourselves, what others give us and what the material nature gives like excess heat, cold, etc. However, the Earth's planet is not like a concentration camp. With proper behaviour, one can enjoy unlimited ‘sukha’ (happiness) also. (5.21) The next question is: why did we not qualify for better planets like Heaven or even Vaikuntha? The answer is the same: our acts with our bodies, minds and words did not make us deserving of them. However, the Earth's planet is very special for one reason. God pays special attention to it; He even incarnates here. (4.7) When we do good, pious acts, we get rewarded at some time in the future. It has to be paid first and again later. < This is the way it must be. There cannot be fun now and fun later also. If we wish better life, and fewer problems and troubles, we must begin taking active shelter from God. The first requirement is to follow dharma, which is very dear to God. The next requirement is to do all duties, i.e. according to time, place and circumstances. (3.8) There is no escape from there because that is the only right given to us. (2.47) Not doing them is dereliction and punishable. Additionally, we must serve others, because this is how the creation can exist. Imagine a day in our lives. How many must contribute to help us exist? The next level is spiritual when we recognize the existence of God and begin praying to Him for whatever we need. We have four main requirements. (7.14) The first one is our material necessities. The next one is help in getting out of trouble. The third one follows; we desire to know more about God. This is when our spiritual journey takes off and ends in becoming knowledgeable about God. In this period, one will do many spiritual acts suiting one’s natural circumstances, etc. Gradually, one will take shelter of God and will remain under it. By now, one would have realised that everything is logical. There is nothing like chance; we reap what we sow. Realised souls do not ever blame God for their woes. Rather they blame themselves for their faulty deeds done earlier. This helps them in two ways. They become careful about what they do now because they are aware that bad acts will surely bring punishment later. And they remain in shelter of God thus safeguarding themselves against future troubles hoping to be bailed out by God (18.58) And God does, as He is very merciful.
