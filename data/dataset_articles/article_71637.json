  "text": "Well, [life ](https://www.britannica.com/science/life)is an open book where you write your own story. It is our story that we write with our unique plot twists and character development. As it is our story, we need to grab the pen and write the script on our own without forgetting that the one who controls your story is none other than yourself. After all, it is the authenticity of your story that makes it uniquely yours. Life is just like a cricket match Life is as complex as a [cricket match](https://www.britannica.com/sports/cricket-sport). Just imagine your life as a huge cricket stadium and you are the only batsman, with no wickets to make you lose, and no other players to catch your ball… it’s not fun, right? The balls that come to you are just like the opportunities and obstacles which often come and go around with time. Similarly, rejections and failure are challenges which you face in life. At times you might keep hitting six no matter how many times the ball was thrown out of reach. And, at times you may not even be able to hit four no matter how easy the ball was. Life is simple and complicated at the same time. It is up to you how you will think about it and how you overcome your thoughts about it. After every sunset, there comes a new morning. Likewise, after every struggle and hard work, there comes a beautiful success. At times you will find people who tend to demotivate you or try to pull you and distract you. However, the overall solution to this might be just ignoring them and just staying focused on your journey. Every human being has their goals to reach in life and everyone has their own story to write. Frustration, irritation, voices in our head and sadness are the parts of our lives, which should not be avoided. The reason is that they are essential to make you strong enough to handle various situations and conditions in future. Savour the good and learn from the bad We all have one life to live where there are dreams, hopes and expectations to come true. It is all based on the trial and error theory. The more mistakes you make, the more lessons you learn. And, with all those lessons you learn there, you meet a better version of yourself. You will not reach the top until and unless you are pricked by the thorns at the bottom. The pain you have felt, the hunger that hurts and those eyes with sleepless nights will put you at that place where you will get everything you deserve. The results you want to see might take time, but giving up is never an option. Bad days are followed by amazing and bright days, you just need to have patience, trust and courage to just keep going no matter what happens. Sometimes, you stumble upon a clearing where everything makes sense, and the sun shines brighter. Other times, you are navigating through thick undergrowth, unsure of where you are headed. Life has its share of laughter and tears, and it’s perfectly normal to feel lost at times. The point here is to savour the good moments, learn from the not-so-good ones, and keep simple pleasures, surround yourself with people who make the journey worthwhile. [Life](https://english.onlinekhabar.com/life-is-it-a-stage.html) is a story we are all writing, filled with plot twists and character development. So, grab your metaphorical pen and write your tale with courage, kindness, and a dash of humour, creating your own unique story.",
