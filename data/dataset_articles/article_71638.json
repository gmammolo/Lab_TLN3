Professional astrologer [Narayana Montúfar](https://www.naramon.com/) told [ Farmer’s Almanac ](https://www.almanac.com/123123-meaning-123123) that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.” If you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12. The number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated.
