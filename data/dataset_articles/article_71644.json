  "text": "EeZee Concept Wrap-Up 2023 With Greater Plans For 2024\nLAGOS – Gospel music in Nigeria has always thrived. With key stakeholders holding the brink of the industry, 2024 might just be the year of blossoming for the promising industry.\nWhat would, continually, form the basis of what we now know today as Nigerian gospel music began to take form until the 19th century.\nWith Reverend Ransome-Kuti putting together about 43 tracks into an album in 1922 Nigerian Gospel Music has always been a voice. Some of these recordings became standards, such as “Oyigi Yigi Olorun Wa”, “Egbe Awon Angeli”, and “Jesu Oba Alaanu”.\nToday, Ransome-Kuti is regarded as the father of Nigerian gospel music and is credited as the first Nigerian to record an album. Nonetheless, there’s always been a need for more platforms for the industry. This is where Eezee Conceptz holds the loudest ovation for 2023.\nFor EeZee Conceptz, 2023 has been nothing less than a year of breaking the status quo of the Nigerian Industry. The Gospel Music label has not only broken the status quo but has also set new standards for the Nigerian Gospel Music Industry.\nEeZee Conceptz, since its inception has always set out to win souls for Christ through music. The group, which also metamorphosed as a label has in the last 12 months consistently created platforms for talented gospel music artists.\nNigerian gospel music is growing at a very fast pace and only the actors can notice or be part of the growth. This is where Eezee belongs. As the unique genre of music has been constructed to be a home of diverse Christian music genres, it has become a rudimentary part of the culture of every Nigerian. With the advent of social media platforms like TikTok, gospel music isn’t bound to the walls of the church any longer. All though, that’s where the root is formed.\nThere have always been calls for platforms to scale the promising industry and that’s where GGTQ erupted from. The Gospel Groove Talent Quest (GGTQ) 2023 initiative, was put together to give a platform and visibility to young Nigerian gospel ministers. The initiative brought limelight to amazing gospel ministers such as Esther Olabisi, Love Abolade, Ibukun Adelegan, and Asaph Idonuagbe. GGTQ succeeded in setting a clear record in the Nigerian Gospel Music Industry. The Grand finale, which was held at the Terra Kulture, Lagos saw the winner, Esther Olabisi, walk away with the top prize of a three-year recording deal, including a brand-new car, accommodation, and a cash prize. The very first in the history of the Gospel Music Industry.\nIf there is anything constant this year, it would be the manner in which EeZee Tee, the EeZee Concept Label Boss, went around holding different sessions, imparting knowledge and leading conversations that bent on building structure around the Nigerian gospel music industry.\nRecently, the Eezee Tee Conceptz Label Boss, Ezekiel Thankgod Onyedikachukwuwu professionally known as EeZee Tee was awarded the Award of Music Executive of the Year by one of Africa’s finest gospel award organisations. This is evident in the number of artists the label has produced and maintained. The label has in her portfolio Gospel music Artiste such as: Mercy Chinwo, Judikay, Chidinma Ekile, Minsiter GUC, Toby Godwin, Esther Oji, and just recently, Esther Olabisi.\nAccording to the Label Boss, in a recent statement, the label’s target is the youth. Challenging their potentials tightly through positive impartation of God’s Word and power.\nWith plans to hold the EeZee Global Mindustry Conference in January 2024, next year is definitely a greater year for Nigerian Music Industry, for EeZee Conceptz.",
