  "text": "WARREN — For the past several years, Second Baptist Church “A House of Hope” in Warren, has collaborated with Trumbull County Children Services to host Night of Hope.\nPastor Todd Johnson said the event provides inspiration and education to help children find loving homes.\n“This is our sixth year of bringing our community together as a church to celebrate Jesus and advocate for the most vulnerable and innocent ones among us — our children and our youth. This is important to my heart,” he said.\nJohnson said his parents had foster children when he was growing up and has foster brothers and sisters that he is still connected with today.\nThe event focused on advocating for youth and families, with a focus on\nfoster care and adoption in Trumbull County. There was music, praise and testimony.\nJohnson said many children are in need of “forever homes” with loving homes and parents.\n“We want to be able to give hope to our young people and children,” Johnson said.\nJanessa Kiefer and Emma Johnson, both case workers from TCCS who were at the event with a display table, said they are always recruiting families to help with fostering.\nKeifer said the event helps with advocacy and awareness for foster care and adoption in the Mahoning Valley.\nPresentations at the event highlighted the need for displaced children to find loving homes, especially among African-American populations.\nEntertainment included artists Terrence J. Dooley and Testimony of Columbus, and Gail Nevels-Stringer of the gospel group, The Nevels Sisters.\nNEWSLETTER Today's breaking news and more in your inbox\nI'm interested in (please check all that apply) Daily Newsletter Breaking News Obituaries Are you a paying subscriber to the newspaper? * Yes No",
