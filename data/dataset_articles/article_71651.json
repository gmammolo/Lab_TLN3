  "text": "(Minghui.org) To celebrate the upcoming New Year, Falun Dafa practitioners gathered at Linhousilin Forest Park on December 17, 2023, sent their New Year greetings to Master Li, the founder of Falun Dafa, and put their palms together in the heshi position, paying their respects. They called out in unison, “We wish Master a Happy New Year” expressing their gratitude and respect to Master. [Falun Dafa practitioners wished Master Li a Happy New Year at Linhousilin Forest Park on December 17, 2023.](/u/article_images/2023-12-24-tw-pindong-01.jpg) [Falun Dafa practitioners wished Master a Happy New Year.](/u/article_images/2023-12-24-tw-pindong-02.jpg) The Linhousilin Forest Park is a beautiful recreational spot for many, during holidays and weekends. Tourists bring their families and enjoy the scenic, natural environment. Practitioners gathered at the park to celebrate the upcoming new year, and wish revered Master a Happy New Year. They held out banners that read, “Happy New Year Master” and “Falun Dafa is good.” The banners were beautiful, could be clearly seen, and attracted all who passed by. Falun Dafa is rooted in Buddhist traditions. Dafa cultivation practice was first disseminated by Master Li Hongzhi in 1992. Practitioners distributed the [Minghui Weekly] publication, and spread the blessings of “Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance” to passersby. Many were delighted, had smiles on their faces after receiving the newspaper, and expressed their gratitude towards practitioners. Falun Dafa practitioners Biqiu and Qing often come to the park on holidays to raise awareness of Falun Dafa, and share their cultivation experiences. Qing said, “Locals and tourists enjoy reading the Minghui Weekly. Passersby and visitors to the park also enjoy receiving the newspaper, and thank us. Some children also like the exquisite Falun Dafa bookmarks. I am happy for them as long as people like the [truth-clarification] materials.” Biqiu shared, “A elderly man was delighted to receive the Minghui Weekly.” He asked, “Where can I get this newspaper regularly?” Biqiu was happy that people enjoyed reading the truth-clarification materials. A couple from Wandan Township was having a picnic under a pavilion. Buqiu gave the man a Dafa newspaper. He said, “Falun Dafa is a qigong practice. It is also a good exercise. Some of my family members and relatives are also Falun Dafa practitioners. It is beneficial to one’s health.” [Mr. Li, from Wandan Township, was happy upon receiving the Minghui Weekly.](/u/article_images/2023-12-24-tw-pindong-03.jpg) Copyright © 2023 Minghui.org.
