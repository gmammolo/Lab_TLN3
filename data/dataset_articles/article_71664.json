  "text": "Jeremy Camp ‘Was Terrified’ About Heart Surgery: ‘God is Teaching Me’ By Movieguide® Contributor Christian artist Jeremy Camp returned to his tour shortly after a surgery that corrected an ongoing heart condition, revealing that he “was terrified.” Earlier this month, he asked fans to pray for him while he underwent surgery to resolve an atrial fibrillation (AFib). Movieguide® [reported](https://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/jeremy-camp-recovering-from-heart-surgery-beyond-grateful.html): “I debated telling everybody this, but for some reason, just felt like I should tell everybody because I have a lot of people saying, ‘What can we be praying for you?’” he [posted]on Instagram before the surgery. “There’s a lot of prayer warriors out there. A lot of people who have been praying for me for different things, and I’m super thankful for it. So, I want to bring this up with intention. I actually have surgery on Monday,” the singer [revealed]. A little over a week later, Camp kicked off his Theater Tour. “YES I am 100 percent going to be out there at each and every city to be with you guys!! I can’t wait!” he [posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4esGzvOIKk/?hl=en). “Doctors said I was cleared to play. Super thankful.” “I have been getting better ❤️ and really excited about this weekend. There is so much to share about all the things God is teaching me,” he [shared](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4q8M0QxDFx/?hl=en) in another post. During his performance in Dayton, Ohio, Camp opened up about his health scare. “It was getting really, really dangerous…and I was terrified to be honest,” he [said](https://churchleaders.com/news/474339-i-was-terrified-jeremy-camp-opens-up-on-tour-about-heart-condition.html), per Church Leaders. Through the process, though, he’s looked for what God wants to teach him. “I think all my life…I’ve dealt with trust issues,” he [explained](https://churchleaders.com/news/474339-i-was-terrified-jeremy-camp-opens-up-on-tour-about-heart-condition.html). “But it’s interesting because there’s like specific things that God is continuing to strip away from me, including my control.” Ultimately, Camp realized, “my life is not in my hands. It’s in God’s hands, and he’s a trustworthy God.” He shared [Proverbs 3:5-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%203%3A5-6&version=NIV), which says, “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.” “God is so good. He’s so faithful,” Camp [added](https://churchleaders.com/news/474339-i-was-terrified-jeremy-camp-opens-up-on-tour-about-heart-condition.html). “That’s not cliché or Christianese. If you’ve experienced God’s goodness and God’s faithfulness—it’s not Christianese, it’s my life. God is good!” Now more than ever we’re bombarded by darkness in media, movies, and TV.
