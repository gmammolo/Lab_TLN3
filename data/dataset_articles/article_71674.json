  "text": "At a Ramadan Iftar in Abuja, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu called on Nigeria's religious leaders to adopt a more constructive approach in their sermons, emphasizing the power of positive speech and prayers over denigration of the country. Highlighting the significant influence of religious figures in shaping societal attitudes, Tinubu advocated for unity and collaboration to tackle the nation's challenges, including terrorism and criminality. This event underscores the administration's commitment to fostering a harmonious relationship between the government and religious communities against the backdrop of economic and security concerns.\nAdvertisment Building Bridges for National Prosperity The president's appeal for a shift from cursing to constructive criticism underlines a broader strategy to engage influential community figures in national development efforts. By emphasizing the need for cooperation between the state and religious institutions , Tinubu aims to harness their considerable influence for social cohesion and national resilience. This engagement is part of a larger vision to transform Nigeria's challenges into opportunities for growth and development, with a particular focus on defeating terrorism and other forms of insecurity.\nEconomic and Security Optimism Advertisment In light of Nigeria's current economic and security challenges, the government's outreach to religious and traditional leaders represents a critical step towards national unity and recovery. Vice President Kashim Shettima's remarks on the economy's positive trajectory and the administration's decisive actions on subsidy removal and economic reforms indicate a hopeful outlook for Nigeria's future. The support from various religious and traditional leaders, as evidenced by their participation in the iftar, suggests a wide-ranging endorsement of the government's efforts to stabilize the economy and improve security.\nReligious Leaders' Role in National Healing The engagement of religious leaders in political and social discourse reflects an acknowledgment of their role in national healing and development. As custodians of faith for millions of Nigerians, their messages can inspire hope, foster peace, and encourage a collective effort towards resolving national issues. This collaboration between state and religious entities, as demonstrated during the Ramadan Iftar, sets a precedent for future partnerships aimed at addressing Nigeria's pressing challenges through unity, dialogue, and mutual respect.\nAs Nigeria navigates through its economic and security challenges, the call by President Tinubu for constructive criticism and national solidarity from religious leaders marks a pivotal moment. It not only reinforces the government's commitment to inclusive governance but also highlights the critical role of faith-based leadership in shaping the country's destiny. The collaborative path embarked upon by the administration and religious figures holds promise for a more prosperous and unified Nigeria, where challenges are met with collective resolve and a shared vision for the future.",
