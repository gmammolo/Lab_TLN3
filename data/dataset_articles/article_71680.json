  "text": "We’ve started a new thing at my church.\nAt the beginning of the weekly worship service the pastor reads this call to worship:\n“To all who are weary and need rest;\nTo all who mourn and long for comfort;\nTo all who feel worthless and wonder if God cares;\nTo all who fail and desire strength;\nTo all who sin and need a Savior:\nThis church opens wide her doors with a welcome from Jesus Christ, the Ally of his enemies, the Defender of the guilty, the Justifier of the inexcusable, the Friend of sinners — Welcome!”\nAlso new, this past week our pastor taught us some Spanish.\n“Aquí somos família” — Here, in this place, we are family.\nJust when I thought I couldn’t love this place any more, I love it more.\nAlong with teaching us Spanish, the pastor reminded us that after his sermon and the closing song, often with his benediction he’ll add something like, “I’m so glad you came, because I needed to see your faces.”\nWhen he writes an email, he often closes with: “I can’t wait to see you at church this weekend. It wouldn’t be the same without you.”\nI love that so much!\nLots of people don’t love church, don’t even like it, and the truth is, many churches give people good reasons not to.\nAuthor Philip Yancey grew up in a church he didn’t like, filled with unyielding rules and unspoken codes, people who were grouchy and suspicious and who kept busy minding other people’s business.\nWhen he was old enough to do so, he walked away from church, although not from Jesus, he said.\nHe wrote a book, “Church: Why Bother?”\nI think lots of people ask that same question.\nMy answer to that is: Aquí somos família.\nGod put us together, a mismatched yet hand-picked assortment of oddballs and screwups who love each other “even before we are acquainted,” to quote St. Celsus who lived in 12th century Ireland.\nYancey said church should be a place for people who “know all about your lousy boss, your mother with heart trouble back in North Carolina and your teenager who won’t do what you tell him; a place where you can unwind, spill your life story and get a sympathetic look, not a self-righteous leer.”\nMany years ago, a man at my church, George Lazo, died. He played the trumpet and was an alcoholic most of his life and a Christian for only a few years before he died.\nAt one time he hopped freight trains and lived in cardboard boxes. I loved to hear his stories!\nHe lived alone, and when it was learned that he was dying, some men in my church took turns sitting with him around the clock until he took his final breath.\nThey would not let George die alone.\nAquí somos família.\nWe are God’s family. He placed us together to live with and love one another as we walk to heaven together.\nThat was the pastor’s message this past weekend, and I told him I was stealing it for my column.\nGod picked us to be together, arranging us with our individual gifts and talents so that we complete each other, not just as one congregation in Lecanto, Florida, but as the church universal, one body in Christ.\nViva família! Viva Jesús Cristo!\nNancy Kennedy can be reached at 352-564-2927 or by email at .",
