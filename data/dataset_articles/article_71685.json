  "text": "Dr Andareas Peter\n“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” – John 3:16\nGood Friday, a significant event in the Christian calendar, occurs on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday and is observed during Holy Week. It serves as a time of deep reflection and solemnity, marking the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ. Christians worldwide commemorate this day with reverence, contemplating the profound sacrifice made by Jesus for the redemption of humanity. Across the globe, churches hold special services and processions to honour the events of Good Friday, emphasizing themes of repentance, forgiveness, and salvation.\nWhen we say it is a Good Friday, people generally think that the day is about celebrating a cause of happiness. Unlike what the term implies, Good Friday is a day that Christians all over the world spend in sorrow. Good Friday is the day when people mourn the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ. Since it is the most significant and holiest day for Christians, people spend this day praying for the forgiveness of their sins. Good Friday is observed two days before Easter, which celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Christians prepare themselves for 40 days by taking Lent before they enter the Holy Week, where they observe Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter.According to the religion of Christianity, people believe that the Almighty God had sent His only son, Jesus Christ, to save people from their sins and guide them on the righteous path. Jesus was born in this world as the son of Joseph and Mary and lived here as a man. Throughout his life, Jesus has been preaching about love and forgiveness and performed several miracles to make people believe in God and eternal life.\nThough Jesus continued to teach, some people did not consider him to be sent by God and hence started protesting against him. He was imprisoned and subjected to cruel punishments, which included intense beating with sharp weapons and carrying the heavy cross for long miles. It was after all this thrashing that he was nailed to the cross and put up to be ridiculed by others. The Good Friday emphasises that Jesus sacrificed himself to pay for the sins of humankind. Since this act is considered a win of good against evil, this day is called Good Friday, even though people lament the death of Jesus.\nThe historical roots of Good Friday trace back to the biblical accounts found in the New Testament. According to Christian belief, Jesus Christ was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death by crucifixion by the Roman authorities in Jerusalem.\nThe crucifixion of Jesus represents a pivotal moment in Christian theology, symbolizing the atonement for human sins and the ultimate act of love and sacrifice. Christians regard Good Friday as a profound expression of God’s mercy and grace towards humanity, as Jesus willingly endured suffering and death to offer redemption and eternal life. The significance of Good Friday extends beyond historical events; it holds deep spiritual meaning for Christians worldwide. It is a day of solemn reflection and contemplation, prompting believers to meditate on the profound love and forgiveness demonstrated through Christ’s death on the cross. Good Friday serves as a reminder of the centrality of Jesus’ sacrifice in the Christian faith, emphasizing themes of redemption, reconciliation, and spiritual renewal. Through prayer, meditation, and worship, Christians seek to deepen their understanding of Christ’s sacrifice and its implications for their lives.\nThroughout history, various traditions and observances have emerged around Good Friday, reflecting the diverse cultural and religious practices of Christian communities worldwide. Church services play a central role in Good Friday observances, featuring solemn liturgies, scripture readings, prayers, hymns, and reflections on the Passion narrative. Many churches also incorporate the Stations of the Cross, a series of devotions depicting Jesus’ journey to the cross, into their Good Friday services.\nFasting and abstinence are common practices among Christians on Good Friday, symbolizing a spirit of penance, self-discipline, and solidarity with Christ’s suffering. Believers abstain from meat and other luxuries as a form of spiritual discipline, seeking to emulate Jesus’ sacrifice and draw closer to God through self-denial. Some Christians observe a strict fast throughout the day, while others may partake in one meal of bread and water or engage in partial fasting. Processions and rituals are also prevalent in many Christian communities on Good Friday. Some churches organize outdoor processions, re-enacting Jesus’ journey to the cross, while others conduct indoor ceremonies that involve the veneration of the cross.\nThe veneration of the cross is a solemn ritual in which believers approach and kiss or touch a crucifix, symbolizing reverence for Christ’s sacrifice and their commitment to following him. Good Friday is marked by a sense of quiet contemplation and reverence, with believers spending time in prayer, meditation, and reflection on the events of Jesus’ crucifixion. It is a day to express gratitude for God’s mercy and grace, acknowledging the significance of Jesus’ sacrifice in bringing salvation and eternal life to humanity. As Christians observe Good Friday, they are reminded of the hope and redemption found in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which is celebrated joyously on Easter Sunday. It is a time for Christians to come together to pray, reflect, and remember the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. In addition to the traditional religious observances, many Christians also use Good Friday as a time to perform acts of charity and service to others. This is because the sacrifice of Jesus Christ is seen as a model of selflessness and love for others, and so Good Friday is an opportunity for Christians to follow in his footsteps. Overall, Good Friday is a solemn and meaningful day for Christians around the world. It is a time to remember the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, to reflect on the importance of selflessness and love for others, and to renew one’s faith and commitment to Christian principles.",
