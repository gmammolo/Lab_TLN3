  "text": "Easter, the cornerstone of the Christian faith, is universally described as a celebration of penance, hope, renewal, and the triumph of life over death. Central to this profound narrative in history is the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, a pivotal moment that unfolded on the cross; an instrument known, and well-recognised, as an emblem of condemnation, retribution, and shame. However, on that fateful day of the crucifixion, amidst the anguish and agony of the execution of the Son of God, one figure emerges from the pages of history; the Roman Centurion who stood at the foot of the cross. His coincidental encounter with divinity and spirituality transformed a moment of despair into a guiding light of redemption.\nIt has been said over and over, again and again, and even year in and year out, that the death of the Son of God on the cross is a moving symbol of the divine love of Jesus that had most definitely been negated and overcome by the deep human wickedness and the imposition of the compelling sense of a much-deserved punishment to a heretic criminal. However, it could also be portrayed as a paradoxical narrative that intertwines the brutality of the crucifixion with the profound message of liberation. As Jesus hung suspended between heaven and earth, with the weight of humanity’s sins pressing intolerably upon him, the Roman Centurion stood as a silent witness to a cosmic drama unfolding, ever so slowly, drearily, and even menacingly.\nThat Roman Centurion, a well-acclaimed symbol of authority and military prowess, was tasked with overseeing the crucifixion; a humdrum, if not callous, duty for a man hardened by the brutality of warfare. For him, this was a routine job and in truth, nothing very special. He had seen many criminals breathe their last on the cross. Yet for all that, when Jesus breathed his last, in that moment of despair and darkness, as the sky turned sombre, grey, and grave, and the earth quaked, something extraordinary transpired within the Centurion’s well-hardened heart. The galactic drama of the crucifixion unfolded not only in the heavens but also within the depths of a human soul; a soul which, right up to that time, had been completely insulated against human suffering.\nThe crucifixion of Jesus had very clearly pulled, ever so strongly at that, on the hitherto cloistered stony heartstrings of a time-tested warrior. In the Gospel of Matthew, we find the Centurion’s response to the events relentlessly unfolding before him, when he said, “Surely he was the Son of God” (Matthew 27:54). That proclamation, uttered by a human who had participated in countless executions, as well as many killings in war, reveals a profound disclosure; the sheer recognition of divinity and mysticism, even amidst dreadful anguish and agony. The Centurion, in witnessing the selfless sacrifice of Jesus, found himself face to face with the divine, transcending the boundaries of his earthly role of being the supervisor of yet another slaying by crucifixion.\nThat transformation experienced by the Roman Centurion embodies the universality of redemption. His acknowledgement of Jesus as the Son of God stands as a powerful testament to the inclusive nature of Jesus Christ’s sacrifice. The crucifixion was very definitely not only for a select few, but for all of humanity, transcending cultural, social, and historical boundaries. The Centurion, through his revelation, becomes an unexpected and unforeseen proclaimer in the gospel: a reminder that the transformative power of Easter extends beyond the expected circles.\nThese echoes of what happened all those years ago have major implications for the present and most certainly for all of us. As we celebrate Easter, we are invited to reflect on the profound implications of Jesus’s death and the unanticipated conversion of the Roman Centurion. The crucifixion is not merely a historical event but a timeless symbol of celestial love that resonates through the corridors of time, and right throughout the ages. The Centurion’s testimony serves as a touching reminder that redemption is not confined to the devout or the righteous, but extends even to the most unlikely of hearts.\nIn the death of Jesus Christ and the revelation of the Centurion, we find a beautiful Symphony of Redemption, weaving together the threads of humanity’s frailty and brokenness, with the gossamers of the divine melody of grace. Easter therefore becomes a celebration, not only of an empty tomb from which the Lord rose from death in triumph, but one that transformed lives, where the darkest moments gave birth to the brightest of hope; a reputed beacon of salvation.\nIt is most certainly a deliverance that all of us need to embrace with a singular dedication.\nPrepared by Dr B.
