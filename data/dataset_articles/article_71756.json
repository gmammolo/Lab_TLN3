  "text": "In the suburbs, Sikhism, Hinduism and Buddhism are booming as Christianity plummets in a society with more atheists than ever.\nBy Melissa Cunningham\nMarch 29, 2024\nBuddhism, Hinduism and Sikhism are growing. Credit: Matt Davidson\n In this series, explore how Victoria’s religious communities are attracting worshippers in an increasingly secular Australia. See all 5 stories. Jaswinder Singh had served hundreds of freshly cooked curries from the back of his white van to ashen-faced East Gippsland residents, whose homes had just been destroyed in bushfires, when a young, dark-haired nurse approached him.\nInstead of accepting the warm bowl of curry he held out to her, she burst into tears. Then she hugged him.\n“She said, ‘I want to say thank you for taking care of my family’,” recalls Singh, who volunteered at the Bairnsdale caravan park in East Gippsland during the 2020 bushfires.\n“She was so grateful we were there to serve her parents food every night. This was her story. It will stay with me until my deathbed.”\nJaswinder Singh. Credit: Chris Hopkins\nFor the 39-year-old, who lives in Hallam in Melbourne’s south-east, this act of selfless service – or seva – is just another day in the life of being a Sikh: a member of the fifth largest and one of the fastest-growing religions in Australia.\nThe number of Australians with no religious affiliation has never been higher, soaring to 39 per cent in 2022, but other smaller religions, including Sikhism, are booming in Melbourne suburbia.\nAdvertisement In Hume, in the city’s northern suburbs, the rapid growth of culturally and spiritually diverse communities has sparked concerns new places of worship are having to be built in often remote industrial zones.\nHume Council wrote to the state government late last year asking it to urgently review planning controls and regulations, so new places of worship could be built in town centres.\nSikh volunteers handing out meals at the Bairnsdale relief centre in 2020. Credit: Joe Armao\nAbout 2.5 million Australians, or roughly 10 per cent of the population, reported an affiliation with a religion other than Christianity in the latest census , equal to a 3.5 per cent increase in the past 25 years.\nMeanwhile, Christianity has plummeted by more than 26 per cent during the same period, and once grand houses of worship are battling a mass exodus and shrinking congregations.\nThe Age has analysed a decade’s worth of census data for a series exploring how Victoria’s religious communities are keeping the faith in an increasingly secular Australia.\nAndrew Singleton, associate professor of sociology and social research at Deakin University, says the growth of religious minorities is tied to migration trends in Australia.\nAdvertisement Loading “They are migrating from majority Hindu, Buddhist and Islamic countries,” he says. “They bring their culture and religion with them, and religious communities in Australia act as a point of connection for new migrants.”\nMore than 210,400 Sikhs like Singh have built a life in Australia. They now make up about 0.8 per cent of the population.\nSingh is one of more than 90,000 Victorian Sikhs, the legacy of waves of Punjabi and Indian migration.\nSince moving to Melbourne in 2009, he has co-founded Sikh Volunteers . Each week, he and other Sikhs drive around in vans overflowing with meals from warm lentil soup to creamy mutter paneer, made with peas and fresh cheese, and deliver food to people in need.\nSingh has prayed with the bereaved in their homes and travelled to NSW to cook for locals during the Lismore flood disaster. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he helped run a free 24-hour counselling service.\nAdvertisement When The Age interviewed him, he had just finished dropping off more than 100 food hampers at the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court to a group of offenders undertaking a drug and rehabilitation program.\nIt is a religious requirement for pious men like Singh to grow a beard and wear a colourful turban, a symbol of spiritual strength, nobility and equality.\n“What I love about my religion is that it is both practical and very inclusive,” Singh says. “Any person from any religion, from any culture, is very welcome. It’s a very modern religion, it gives both men and women equal space and equal rights. There is no discrepancy.”\nAs the population of Sikhs grow, the number of gurdwaras (places of congregational worship) has soared in Victoria to keep pace, emerging in Pakenham, Cranbourne, Langwarrin, Hoppers Crossing, Ballarat, Geelong and Mildura.\nOznatyam Dance Group members prepare for the Wyndham Diwali Festival in November 2023. Credit: Penny Stephens\nThe religion was founded in the 1400s by Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the first of 10 Sikh gurus to guide and establish the faith. It emphasises the idea of spiritual oneness and belief all humans are equal. It is based on three principles: earning an honest living, meditation and acts of charity and compassion.\nAdvertisement “If I am working in my job and treating everyone with respect and love, then I am already fulfilling the first principle,” Singh says.\nThe origins of the concept of “seva” , a selfless service performed without any expectation of reward, can be traced back thousands of years to the sacred Hindu text Bhagavad Gita, which encourages selfless service to develop spiritually and promote good karma.\nAbout 680,000 Hindus live in Australia, and Victoria is home to more than a third of them.\nLoading Meanwhile, the number of Muslims in Victoria has more than doubled from 109,369 in 2006 to 273,028 in 2021, equal to about 4.5 per cent of the state’s population, ahead of Hindus (3.5 per cent) and Buddhists (3.4 per cent).\nThe number of Hindus living in the state has soared from about 42,300 in 2006, to more than 214,000 in 2021, as migrants from India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Fiji, Malaysia and Singapore arrived in Victoria.\nAdvertisement Hinduism Australia’s fastest-growing religion Under a bright orange sky, just before dusk, a stream of cars turns into a driveway off an industrial street in Carrum Downs.\nYou would not know it from standing in the street, but buried behind a nondescript cream building and lush, green gardens with roaming peacocks, is the largest Hindu temple in the southern hemisphere.\nEach week, more than 1000 people travel from all over Victoria and beyond to worship at the Sri Shiva Vishnu temple, where the granite towers are engraved with images of Hindu gods, and the roof glows warm gold, like a halo in the night sky.\nOn a Hindu holy day, a Friday night or weekend, you can barely find a car park .\nBut on this balmy Thursday evening, mothers dressed in colourful saris arrive clutching their babies for a special blessing to mark the child’s 31st day on Earth, when a black dot, called a pottu, is placed on the child’s forehead for protection.\nInside the temple, bare-chested Hindu priests, draped in cream-coloured robes, bless babies. Other priests bathe sacred statues of Hindu gods and goddesses in cow’s milk.\nThere are idols of almost all Hindu gods, including Brahma, considered to be the creator of the universe. Photography and filming inside are prohibited to preserve the sanctity of the temple.\nHindu Society of Victoria president Sabaratnam Kathirkhanthan at the Shri Shiva Vishnu temple in Carrum Downs. Credit: Eddie Jim\nPlatters of fresh fruit are offered to the gods, and incense burns. It is a morning and evening ritual of worship known as puja, believed to bring peace, happiness and prosperity.\nThe temple was built in the 1980s. Hindu Society of Victoria president Sabaratnam Kathirkhanthan says the community has grown from a congregation of a few hundred to many thousands, fanned by soaring rates of Indian and Sri Lankan migration to Melbourne.\nLoading Thousands of Hindus are now raising families across Melbourne’s culturally diverse suburbs including Noble Park and Cranbourne, “Little India” in Greater Dandenong, and Wyndham, Werribee, Laverton and Point Cook in Melbourne’s south-west, the latter affectionately known by locals as “Mumbai Cook”.\nEach November, the Hindu community celebrates the most important event of its cultural calendar: Diwali. The five-day festival is celebrated in schools, offices, parks and stadiums across the nation.\nThousands also brave the winter chill in July to celebrate the Ratha Yatra (Chariot Festival) at the Sri Shiva Vishnu temple, towing a chariot, which symbolises the pulling of God into one’s heart.\nHinduism is an immense set of beliefs and practices, with its history traced to a compilation of scriptures known as the four vedas.\nA Hindu views the entire universe as God’s and everything in the universe as God.\n“Even in the modern day, the Hindu tradition is thousands of years old, but we still follow the same traditions. We still pray for peace and harmony for all,” Kathirkhanthan says.\n“What we practise, the discipline that we have in our religion, is something that my children, who were born here, are so very proud of.”\nThe rise of Buddhism About 17 kilometres north of the Sri Shiva Vishnu temple are three Buddhist temples with floating Chinese pagodas, scattered along a busy stretch of road in Springvale in Melbourne’s south-eastern suburbs.\nEach temple belongs to a different Asian community: Vietnamese, Cambodian and Chinese.\nLoading When The Age visits the Chinese Bright Moon Buddhist Society temple in Melbourne’s south-east one Sunday afternoon in late spring, a group of Buddhists and monks, dressed in brown robes, is quietly chanting in a hall for the spirits of the dead.\nThis year, the temple, which was meticulously built over 15 years, was gutted by a fire .\nYet, this has not stopped a dedicated group of Buddhists from coming together in the hall beneath the rubble and remains of the once gold and crimson temple to meditate.\nIt is an annual cultural event in the Buddhist calendar known as the Hungry Ghosts Festival. It is thought that during this time the gates of the afterlife open and allow spirits to roam the Earth.\nThe festival has an origin story, rooted in ancient Chinese history, about a monk who seeks help from the Buddha for his mother in the afterlife. It is said that when the monk’s mother died, she morphed into a hungry wandering ghost.\n“So we feed those souls who have passed away without any family to follow in their footsteps and help them to get to the pure land,” Bright Moon Buddhist Society manager Duong Lang Anh says through a translator.\nBuddhist monks lead prayers to mark the Hungry Ghosts Festival at the Bright Moon Buddhist Society temple in Springvale. Credit: Eddie Jim\nInside the hall, food is laid out on tables for the souls of the departed; plates are brimming with coconut cookies, chocolate bars and fresh fruit to feed the stomachs of hungry spirits.\nIn the middle of the hall sits a gold and red painted statue of a smiling Jambhala, the god of wealth, which was charred by the fires.\nThe statue was the only monument not to be reduced to a pile of ash. Lang Anh sees Jambhala’s survival in the fire as a sign of good fortune to come.\n“He brings wealth and abundance to his devotees,” she says.\nThe term Buddha means “enlightened one”.\n“In Buddha’s eyes, when we are born, we bring something from the past,” Lang Anh says. “So this life is about bettering yourself.”\nShe says a lot has changed since the Bright Moon Buddhist Society began in a residential garage Springvale in 1980.\nA wave of migrants from India, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, China and Vietnam has meant the congregation has swollen from a dozen people to hundreds.\nA growing number of Christians and secular but spiritual Victorians are also coming there each week to meditate.\n“Our temple is open to everybody,” she says. “Being a Buddhist, we are not only for ourselves. We open the door to everyone who comes into the temple.”\nA shrine to Buddha at the Bright Moon Buddhist Society temple. Credit: Eddie Jim\nDeakin University’s Andrew Singleton says the conversion of people who were not born into Buddhism remains “infinitesimally small”.\n“Buddhism probably has the highest proportion of converts, and that is because there’s quite a crossover between an interest in Buddhist philosophy and meditation practices,” he says. “But the numbers remain very low.”\nEach morning, Lang Anh chants, and each day, she prays. “My prayers are not just for my family, but for the whole world,” she says. “I pray for the world to be calm, to be peaceful, and for everyone to be safe.”\nLoading Buddhism sustains her.\n“It keeps my heart pure,” she says. “It helps me to see that everything in life has a higher meaning.”\nSave Log in , register or subscribe to save articles for later.
