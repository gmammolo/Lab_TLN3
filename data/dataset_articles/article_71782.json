  "text": "This weekend, Nigerians from all walks of life will join the global Christian family to celebrate the 2024 Easter holidays that begin on Good Fri­day, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday.\nEaster is a festival which marks the resurrec­tion of Jesus Christ. For many Christians, Easter is a celebration of the triumph of life over death, and a very auspicious period of the year.\nThus, in Nigeria the government has declared Friday, Sunday and Monday as public holidays for Christians, especially to mark the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\nIt is the fad globally and Nigerians take advan­tage of the holiday to travel or spend with friends and family and visit recreation centres to unwind.\nRecreation Centres and Tourist Centres\nPeople celebrate Easter in various ways, in­cluding attending church services, exchanging gifts, enjoying festive meals with family and friends, and participating in Easter egg hunts.\nEaster fancy costumes are a popular tradition that adds a touch of whimsy and fun to the hol­iday.\nHowever, in Nigeria, the period comes with festive vibes as many take time out to visit fam­ily members or visit places of interest after the church service.\nSuch places to visit across the zones abound in the country.\nAccording to Statista, in 2021, there were over 146,000 tourist establishments in Nigeria. This number was consistent over the three previ­ous years and was also the highest number of establishments within the years under review. Conversely, in 2015, Nigeria recorded the lowest number of tourist establishments, at 5,655.\nBayelsa State – Odi\nOdi city is one of the cities in Bayelsa that still clings very tightly to their cultural heritage.\nThis is evident in the Odi Ogori Ba Uge, the biggest festival celebrated by the Odi people of Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. Every year on July 27th, the com­munity rolls out its drums for dances; its boats for regattas and showcases several pageants to spice the festivities.\nThe festival marks the victory over a mysteri­ous buffalo (Ogori), which kept the community under a siege of attacks for five years.\nIt was recorded that during this period no few­er than five persons were killed by the buffalo. A solution to the problem was sought by one of the indigenes, Chief Nengi Thomson Agedah, who reportedly went on a journey to get help from a certain Mallam of Tara.\nAbuja- Zuma Rock\nZuma Rock is a large natural monolith, or in­selberg, an igneous intrusion composed of gab­bro and granodiorite, in Niger State, Nigeria. It is located in the west of Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, along the main road from Abuja to Kaduna off Madala, and it is sometimes referred to as the “Gateway to Abuja from Suleja”.\nBorno state – Shehu of Borno Palace\nThe palace is prominently located in Maidu­guri metropolis and it reflects the grandeur, pres­tigious relics and modified architectural design of Arab civilization.\nIt is built of burnt bricks and was constructed by the artistry of four famous Kanuri Masons and Architects.\nOther places of interest include the Sambisa forest, Sanda Kyarimi Park Zoo, Rabeh’s Fort, Dikwa, Lake Tilla, and Borno State Museum, among others.\nLagos State – Nike Art Gallery\nThe Nike Art Gallery is a beacon of innovation for an aesthetic and cultural experience.\nThis multi-story art gallery displays an exten­sive collection of Nigerian artwork, including traditional artefacts, modern paintings, sculp­tures, and more.\nOther places to visit in Lagos include the Ikeja Shopping Mall, Lekki Conservation Centre, Ele­gushi Beach, National Museum Lagos, Johnson Jakande Tinubu Park, and others.",
