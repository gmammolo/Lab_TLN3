  "text": "With Easter fast approaching, Fox News host Pete Hegseth led coworkers in a\nlive prayer to acknowledge the close of the Lenten season. The prayer was part of a segment promoting the Catholic prayer app Hallow. The app has notable Catholics share prayers and daily devotionals from the likes of Jonathan Roumie, who plays Jesus on “The Chosen,” and actor Mark Wahlberg. Hegseth called on his co-hosts Rachel Campos-Duffy and Will Cain as well as their viewing audience to join him in reading one of Hallow’s Lenten prayers.\n“It’s the fifth Sunday of Lent, and our prayer series continues with the reading of prayer from the Hallow app. We all need it; let’s do it this morning,” said Hegseth, instructing everyone to “Close your eyes. If you would, bow your head.” The prayer was also displayed on-screen for viewers. “Jesus, today we begin the holy period of passion tide,” Hegseth prayed. “In these last 2 weeks of Lent, help us understand the mystery of Your sacrifice and surrender, make us keenly aware of Your love for us. We ask that You make Yourself known to us, help us to feel the grace of Your presence,” he said. He added that Christ had “journeyed to the cross for our sake” and asked that God would help others “to see ourselves the way you see us and come to believe that we are worthy of your abounding love.” He finished the recitation, asking that God would “Aspire in us the same sacrificial, selfless love you showed on the cross. Oh, Jesus, we surrender ourselves to you. Take care of everything. Amen.”\nHegseth has often taken a Christian focus through his work with Fox News. He hosted a 6-episode series called “The Life of Jesus,” with\npart one being released at Christmas time 2022, with Hegseth traveling the roads that Jesus traveled. Part two was released last year at Easter, with Hegseth focusing on Christ’s betrayal and crucifixion. He previously called the project his “passion” and that he wanted “to remind — first and foremost — myself, my family but, writ large, our culture of the reason for the season. Underneath all of that pageantry [of the holidays] is the truth, and the birth of a baby in Bethlehem 2,000 years ago, and the life that Jesus, fully God and fully man, lived.” He has also spoken about how fatherhood has shifted his focus on the Gospels. “I’ve got a bunch of kids, and you start to realize that the only thing that matters is introducing them to Jesus Christ,” he said. “You spend so much time teaching them how to dribble a basketball or to love America — and those are all great, but they’re utterly insufficient.”",
