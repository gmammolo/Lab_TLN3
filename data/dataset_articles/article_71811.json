  "text": "Pilgrims begin the journey to Santuario de Chimayo for Good Friday The annual pilgrimage to El Santuario de Chimayo is a New Mexico tradition people make the walk every year with a purpose. Everyone has a story, even among dozens of miles of road. “It was a promise I made when my son was 4 years old,” pilgrim from Gallup, Melissa Sowers, said. While cars speed by on I-25, one man is on a different journey. “I said, ‘If one day I walk, I'm going to Chimayo.’ Juan Carlos Rangel said. Putting one foot in front of the other, Juan Carlos Rangel reflects on his connection to a Saint known for hope and impossible causes. “I am a believer in St. Jude. Each promise I make, I must fulfill,” Rangel said. The pilgrimage is not new for Rangel but a new challenge as he walks 75 miles from his home in Bernalillo. Every year each of these believers walks with a deep purpose. For Rangel it was roll over car accident that deepened his faith. He said, “I had a major accident. I fractured my femur and was on crutches for three years.” Sowers said, “This year is actually a dedication to my daughter, who is a cancer survivor.” Every footstep is closer to reflection. “Just a whole sense of peace,” Sowers said. Surrounded by the sun, wind, and, New Mexico landscape lies an eagerness to get to the final destination. Rangel said, “I did it because it's always been my dream to walk from Bernalillo to the Santuario.” A journey he never imagined, “I thought I would never be able to walk again, but there are miracles.” Most people will make their way to El Santuario tomorrow. Many believe the holy dirt inside this church has healing powers. Pilgrims will rub it onto their ailments to get relief.",
