During fasting, meals are only consumed before sunrise and after sunset. There are certain foods that Muslims are not allowed to consume during this time. As Ramadan fast approaches, one of the big questions at the back of the mind of most Muslims is, what can you eat during Ramadan?\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n[What can you eat during Ramadan?](#350825-what-can-you-eat-during-ramadan) [What are you not supposed to eat during Ramadan?](#350825-what-are-you-not-supposed-to-eat-during-ramadan) [What is the best breakfast for Ramadan?](#350825-what-is-the-best-breakfast-for-ramadan) [What is the sunset meal for Ramadan?](#350825-what-is-the-sunset-meal-for-ramadan) [What is a special dish for Ramadan?](#350825-what-is-a-special-dish-for-ramadan) [What are 3 examples of traditional Ramadan foods?](#350825-what-are-3-examples-of-traditional-ramadan-foods) [What to eat before fasting for Ramadan?](#350825-what-to-eat-before-fasting-for-ramadan) [What is allowed and not allowed during Ramadan?](#350825-what-is-allowed-and-not-allowed-during-ramadan)\nRamadan is the holiest month in the Islamic calendar. For the entire\nmonth of Ramadan in Kenya and the rest of the world, Muslims enter a period of spiritual contemplation and reflection on their faith in Allah. In fact, it is one of the Five Pillars of Islam.\nWhat can you eat during Ramadan?\nDuring Ramadan, two main meals are served: suhoor, which is served before dawn, and iftar, which is served after sunset. Suhoor should be a hearty, healthy meal to provide needed energy throughout a day of fasting — it ends when the sun rises and the fajr, or morning prayer, begins.\nAt the end of the day, when the sun sets, the maghrib prayer starts, and the day's fast is broken with iftar. Muslims can continue eating and drinking throughout the night until the next day's suhoor. At the end of the\nRamadan month, Muslims celebrate the Festival of Fast-Breaking, called Eid al-Fitr. Here is how your Ramadan food list should look like.\nRamadan dishes for suhoor\nFor suhoor, you need to begin the day with a simple meal that will give you enough energy to get you through the day and help you endure up to 15 hours. Various delicious and healthy foods can be served during this time. These include:\n- Whole oat pudding: Oats are a great source of fibers, which slows down the release of energy, keeping you full for longer.\n- Protein smoothie: Peanut butter is an excellent source of protein, and it's filled with healthy monounsaturated fat. Bananas are an important source of resistant starch that will help you feel full. Blend milk, yogurt, quick oats, banana, peanut butter, chia seeds, and cocoa powder for a quick protein smoothie.\n- Poached eggs: Eggs are considered a healthy source of protein and Vitamin D. Add it on top of grainy toasts and top it off with sliced tomatoes for added fiber. Eating eggs will leave you feeling full.\n- Fruits and vegetables: They are rich in minerals and vitamins that help one feel energized and stay hydrated. Examples of fruits to be consumed during suhoor include watermelon, strawberries, peaches, oranges, tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, spinach, and celery. You can make a salad which will bring together several fruits and vegetables.\n- Nuts: This nature's gift is known to make people full with just a small quantity. If you pair nuts with hot milk, then that would become a wholesome combination because dairy products are also very fulfilling. You can also add nuts to yogurt. If you want to pair it up with bread, then you can use nut butters.\n- Dairy products such as milk and cheese\n- Bread and cereals\n- Ensure that you consume water during suhoor to keep your body hydrated during the day.\nRamadan dishes for iftar\nAre you stuck on what to prepare or eat for the iftar meal? Here is a list of healthy Ramadan fasting Iftar food items:\n- Dates: Muslims break their fast by eating 1 or 3 dates before beginning the iftar meal, as was the practice of Prophet Mohammed, who broke his fast with three dates and water.\n- Soups: They are a very healthy option for starting the Iftar. They play an essential role in replenishing the body fluids and prepare the stomach to receive other foods. Some of the soups to try out include lentil, vegetable, chicken, and vermicelli soups.\n- Juices: After a full day fast, you will need a healthy starter full of vitamins. It is recommended that you consume a glass of refreshing juice, such as orange or carrot juice. The juice should be consumed before or after the meal to replace the fluids lost during the day.\n- Fresh vegetables: As you know, vegetables are a very important source of fibers, vitamins, and minerals needed after a long day without food. These play a critical role in preventing constipation and bloating, which are common problems during fasting. Ensure that the iftar meal is loaded with a rich combination of fresh vegetables.\n- Water: It is important that you drink eight glasses of water during this period to hydrate the body. Ensure that you distribute the water glasses in small quantities between iftar and suhoor to prevent bloating.\n- Main course: At the end of the day, you should gather around the table to eat the delicious main course that includes stews, stuffed vegetables, side dishes, starchy foods, fish and meat dishes, and so on. The main course can also include Ramadan\nspecial dishessuch as chicken kebab, biryani, paya curry, egg fried rice, and so on.\nTraditional Muslim food\nTraditional dishes should be on top of the list of Ramadan food items. The following are some of the traditional iftar and suhoor food items that should be served during Ramadan.\n- Omelet roll\n- Soothing porridge\n- Rice pudding\n- Bean breakfast spread\n- Fish stew\n- Moroccan lentil soup\n- Chicken biryani\nWhat are you not supposed to eat during Ramadan?\nThe discussion of food for Ramadan also includes those food items that should not be eaten during this time. It is advisable that you avoid or\nlimit the intake of these foods during Ramadan:\n- Avoid fried and fatty foods, which contain a high percentage of the daily recommended fat and sodium intake, such as chips and samosa. Frequent consumption of these foods increases fatigue and exhaustion.\n- Avoid those foods that contain high amounts of salt. Sodium can dehydrate the body and affect its ability to absorb fluids.\n- Avoid foods that contain large amounts of sugar. These foods are often high in calories but poor in nutritional value. Even though these foods provide the body with instant energy, the energy is generally short-lived.\n- Stay away from foods that contain chocolate or any other source of caffeine. Caffeine is a diuretic and can cause the body to lose fluids, salts, and other important minerals needed during the day.\nWhat is the best breakfast for Ramadan?\nDates are the best breakfast snack you can take. They are a traditional way to break the fast and are a great source of natural sugars, fiber, and essential nutrients. They will give you a quick energy boost.\nWhat is the sunset meal for Ramadan?\nThe sunset meal for Ramadan is called Iftar. It is a very important meal, both physically and culturally, as it breaks the day's fast.\nWhat is a special dish for Ramadan?\nSome special dishes for Ramadan vary greatly across the regions celebrating Ramadan. Some people opt for sweet or savory pastries and soups.\nWhat are 3 examples of traditional Ramadan foods?\nPrimary traditional Ramadan foods include omelette rolls, soothing porridge and chicken biryani.\nWhat to eat before fasting for Ramadan?\nSuhoor, the pre-dawn meal before a day of fasting\nduring Ramadan, is an important meal to fuel your body for the day ahead.\nWhat is allowed and not allowed during Ramadan?\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn until sunset, refraining from eating, drinking, smoking, and engaging in sexual activity. You can maintain good Ramadan health tips by practicing proper hygiene, praying, doing charity work, and doing good deeds.\nWhat can you eat during Ramadan? The above list of food items that can be taken during this period should serve as a guide. Food eaten before fasting will ensure that you have enough energy to last you throughout the day. To maintain a balanced and nutritious diet, ensure you consume food from all the major food groups equally distributed between the two meal times.\nTuko.co.ke shared 100+ awesome\nprofile pic comments for Facebook.
