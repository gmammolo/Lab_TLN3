  "text": "2024-03-29 02:33:00\nPope Francis, who is known for his concern for prisoners, washed the feet of 12 female prisoners today as part of a ritual marking Maundy Thursday, AFP reported.\nThe Pope visited Rebibia women’s prison in the north-east of the Italian capital this afternoon. He already performed this ritual there in 2015, but for the first time now he is washing the feet of female prisoners, BTA reported.\nSeated in a wheelchair, the Holy Father washed the feet of each of the 12 female prisoners, some of whom shed tears. Then he wiped their feet with a towel, which he kissed at the end.\nThe eighty-seven-year-old pope appeared to be in good health, although in recent days his state of health has given cause for concern due to recurring infections that have prevented him from delivering his homilies on several occasions.\n“We all experience small and big failures,” the pope said in an impromptu homily during the Mass celebrated in the courtyard of the detention center where about 370 women are imprisoned.\nWashing the feet is “a gesture that calls us to serve others,” he added, shaking hands with the inmates before the ritual.\nIn Christian tradition, Maundy Thursday is the day when Christ washed the feet of his apostles during the Last Supper. The ritual has been preserved throughout Christianity, with the exception of some branches of Protestantism, according to AFP.\nIt is a highlight of Holy Week, which marks the last days of Christ before his resurrection.\nSince his election in 2013 as head of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Francis has made several visits to prisons and refugee centers on Maundy Thursday, where he washes the feet of former mobsters, the sick and the marginalized.\nTomorrow night he will lead a reenactment of the Stations of the Cross at the Colosseum – an event he was unable to attend in 2023 for health reasons, AFP notes.",
