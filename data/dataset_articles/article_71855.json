  "text": "Stamford organization to distribute kosher food for Passover following donation A Stamford organization is helping people prepare for the Jewish holiday of Passover. Schoke Jewish Family Service of Fairfield County , the Met Council on Jewish Poverty and the Jewish Family Service of Hartford have partnered to provide kosher food for Passover. Schoke Jewish Family Service of Fairfield County and Jewish Family Service of Hartford are the only two kosher food pantries in Connecticut. On Thursday, members of the Met Council delivered food from Brooklyn to Schoke's location on Greyrock Place. The delivery included over 50 cases of frozen chicken, 40 cases of eggs and fresh produce. More than 100 cases of shelf-stable kosher Passover items such gefilte fish, matzah ball soup and grape juice were also delivered. Closer to the holiday, both organizations will distribute the items to those in need, along with seniors and Holocaust survivors. Organizers say the distribution will make it easier for residents to access kosher food. \"They want to come to a place that understands them, that knows that life is challenging and where they can get the food that they really need, to put the food on the table, feed their families and so when they come here and see that they can get the things that allow them to maintain their religious and cultural lifestyle, it's hopeful. You know, they feel like we hear them, we're answering their needs,\" says Leah Schehcter, Schoke's chief program officer. Passover begins sundown on April 22 and ends sundown on April 30.",
