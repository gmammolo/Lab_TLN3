  "text": "If the image of the Catholic Church is to emerge less tainted by the scandals of the past decade, thanks will no doubt be due to people like Pat Power. He exudes kindness and generosity.He still keeps in touch with a woman who came to him 40 years of so ago to seek help for sexual abuse she had suffered 17 years earlier.His kindness to her continues to this day.Pat Power at 82 is now well retired from his formal roles in the Archdiocese of Goulburn and Canberra. He lives in a humble house in Campbell, sharing his morning and evening walks with Clara ,his Portuguese podengo hound. This Easter, he confines himself to the pews during mass. \\u003cbr\\u003eHis reflections on the past are astute.He believes that the Church has since put in safeguards. It instituted a set of rules and ways of behaving designed to protect children and to instill good behaviour in the minds and actions of priests.The priest was born in Queanbeyan on February 11, 1942. He went to St Christopher's School in Manuka and then St Edmund's School in Canberra. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1965. \\u003cbr\\u003eHe did a doctorate in church law in Rome and then returned to Canberra. In 1986, he was made a bishop (a title which he is still entitled to use in retirement).\\u003cbr\\u003eQueanbeyan made him what he is - a compassionate, generous Catholic who moves easily with people of all classes.His father worked in the shops in Manuka and was a Justice of the Peace.Queanbeyan in the 50s and 60s was the destination of migrants from Italy. His father treated them well, and from that he learnt to value justice and fairness.He would now be thought of as on the liberal wing of the church. He has a lot of time for the current Pope but not so much for the hard-liner, Pope John-Paul II (whom he admires for his role in the downfall of communism in his native Poland). in the grandeur of the cathedral, Bishop Power retained a similar feeling for those on the outside of the group. He would make a point of conducting masses on the edges of the archdiocese, in small country churches in Lake Cargelligo, Ungarie or West Wyalong.",
