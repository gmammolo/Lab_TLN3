As per the information received Ram Mandir will remain open for 24 hours from April 15 to April 17 for this occasion, so that devotes can meet their Ramlala anytime they want.

Therefore, senior officials of the Ayodhya administration are reportedly holding frequent meetings and reviewing all details.\nAbout 2 lakh devotees visit the Ram temple every day. Sometimes this number goes up to 4 to 5 lakhs.
