  "text": "GOOD Friday this morning saw the Catholic faithful from the Rapopo Parish, Kokopo District celebrate the ‘Way of the Cross’.\nAlso known as the “Station of the Cross, this centuries-old celebration is recognized by Roman Catholics throughout the world and typically right before Easter.\nIn the usually quiet and serene locality of the Rapopo Parish, the community was up before 6 this morning to experience the pivotal moments from Jesus’ sentencing to his death to his burial.\nThe singing and prayers at each of the 14 stations served as powerful reminders while giving an opportunity for Christians alike to step into some of the most significant moments in human history.\nOn Good Friday, Catholics walk to 14 different stations and are invited to remember:\nStation 1\nPilate condemns Jesus to die.\nStation 2\nJesus accepts his cross\nStation 3\nJesus falls for the first time\nStation 4\nJesus sees his afflicted mother\nStation 5\nSimon helps Jesus carry the cross\nStation 6\nVeronica offers her veil to Jesus\nStation 7\nJesus falls the second time\nStation 8\nJesus speaks to the women\nStation 9\nJesus falls the third time\nStation 10\nJesus is stripped off his garments\nStation 11\nJesus is nailed to the cross\nStation 12\nJesus dies upon the cross\nStation 13\nJesus is taken down from the cross\nStation 14\nJesus is placed in the sepulcher",
