  "text": "Nearly 300 couples to get married in mass wedding right before the solar eclipse RUSSELLVILLE, Ark. (CNN) - In just under two weeks, so many people will pause to step outside to experience the total solar eclipse. That time will also be memorable for hundreds of couples in Arkansas who are getting ready for a unique mass wedding. Amidst the celestial spectacle of the total solar eclipse, a captivating love story will unfold for Carlotta Cox and Matthew Holloway of Knoxville, Tennessee, as they exchange vows just before the skies go dark. “Being in the path of totality during a solar eclipse is just something that there’s not an experience like it and for people that have not really experienced it. I kind of do recommend that they put it on their bucket list,” said Cox. As the countdown intensifies, Cox and Holloway are reflecting on the significance of their union. “When totality hits, then the cicadas come out, and then all the other animals, night animals, they’re starting to come out for a few minutes, and then the temperature drop. I don’t know how to explain the feeling that it gives you,” Cox said. And it comes at no cost to the couple. “For us, it was really that it was a free wedding,” she said. The event is being organized by Rodney Williams. “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience with the eclipse and a lot of couples have unique reasons for wanting to be married during that time,” said Williams. Nearly 300 couples from 22 different states will get hitched, making their mark on history. “It’s really grown way above my original expectations. I think the emotions from seeing the eclipse take place are just going to be a synergistic effect that heightens everything and brings tears to the eyes. Seeing the smiling faces and hopefully seeing stars and just being a part of that is going to make me happy,” said Williams. This couple’s wedding amidst the cosmic wonders of the eclipse will undoubtedly be etched in the tapestry of their love story. The mass wedding ceremony will take place on April 8 at the City of Russellville Soccer Complex.
