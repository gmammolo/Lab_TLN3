  "text": "Kel Mitchell Encourages ‘Open-Ended Conversation’ With God By Movieguide® Contributor Actor, producer and comedian Kel Mitchell is reflecting on the importance of prayer. “This is what I want to tell you,” Mitchell [began](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXq7YiH-bP0) a recent sermon. “God wants to be included in every activity, every conversation, every problem, and even every thought that you have. I want y’all to know that you can carry on a continuous, open-ended conversation with God throughout the day. Talking with him about whatever is going on in your life.” “Hear Him out and talk to Him and find instruction,” he [continued](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXq7YiH-bP0). “You need to do that every day because although life be lifing—y’all know what that means, life be lifing—you got to also understand that God be guiding too. Life be lifing, but God be guiding, meaning what God promised you will happen, but are you bold enough to step into the light?” Mitchell found fame through ’90s Nickelodeon shows like ALL THAT and KENAN & KEL. While he still acts—most recently appearing in 2023’s GOOD BURGER 2—he became a licensed pastor in 2019. “I’ve always known God,” he [told](https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/nickelodeon-star-kel-mitchell-explains-why-became-youth-pastor-ive-always-known-god) Fox News Digital. “Grew up in a church, but there’s a difference between knowing God and having a relationship with God. And I just got to a point in my life where I wanted to make sure that He was in everything that I do.” Mitchell often shares his faith and encourages followers through his [social media platform](https://www.instagram.com/p/C42A3sGu1m6/). Several weeks ago, he posted a prayer urging his fans to invite Christ into every area of their lives. It [read](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2XqErCJhh5/): “I realize the supernatural realm is where victories are won. So I declare the victory in Jesus’s name. I declare victory over every Goliath in my life-in my family, my finances, my workplace, my church/ministry, and my body. I decree and declare that today is the dawning of a new season of success and fruitfulness. Old things have passed away; behold, all things are becoming new. In Jesus’s name, amen.” “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced,” he [quoted](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2XqErCJhh5/?img_index=3), adding, “Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Be kind. Always.” Movieguide® previously [reported](https://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/kel-mitchell-its-a-beautiful-feeling-to-be-in-harmony-with-god.html): Actor and pastor Kel Mitchell emphasizes the importance of accepting God’s messages and staying “in harmony” with one’s faith. “When you receive a heartfelt letter, there is excitement. We want to have that same excitement to know that God loves us, so when He sends a message to us, we have to be willing to receive it,” Mitchell [said]in a recent sermon. “The words of the Bible are like personal texts into your spiritual inbox.” He explained that not only do you need to be excited to receive these messages, you need to be ready and willing for whatever God is calling you to do. “Challenging us to be different — that is what God is saying. Challenging us to be different, encouraging us to transform our thinking and live according to a higher purpose. His purpose,” Mitchell said.
