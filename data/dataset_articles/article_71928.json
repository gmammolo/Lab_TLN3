  "text": "More than 200 Police officers, including officers from the five policing divisions and recruits, were reminded to trust in God’s plan and remain silent despite being falsely accused or misunderstood by others. While speaking at their Easter Service, Fiji Police Force Chaplain Assistant Superintendent of Police Reverend Joeli Mawi called on officers to remain innocent in the face of accusation as Jesus did so when he was falsely accused by his opponents. Rev Mawi says silence, humility and obedience are the best solutions to their challenges. He also called on officers to stand by their principles and values because sometimes, decision-making will be challenged. Acting Commissioner of Police Juki Fong Chew, in his Easter message, called on officers to come together and recommit themselves to becoming better versions of themselves. He says to recommit to getting rid of the old and bad practices and getting back to basics of policing. Chew says officers should recommit themselves to being professional and honest and to serve to the best of their ability at all times. Stay tuned for the latest news on our radio stations",
