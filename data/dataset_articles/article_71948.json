  "text": "Good Friday 2024: The occasion of Good Friday is an important observance in the Christian community. It is observed before Easter Sunday and after Maundy Thursday and this year is being celebrated on March 29. The Good Friday week is extremely important and includes special days such as Palm Sunday, Holy Monday, Holy Tuesday, Holy Wednesday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday and Easter.\nUsually, the date of Good Friday and Easter celebrations depends on the lunar cycle and the timing of the Jewish festival of Passover, which is rooted in the Biblical account of Jesus&apos;s crucifixion and resurrection. Good Friday signifies the victory of good over evil as Christians believe that with his death, Jesus Christ took all the sins of the world. Usually, people think that Good Friday is a celebratory day because of &apos;Good&apos; in it, but according to the beliefs, it is a mourning day and is also known as &apos;Black Friday&apos; or &apos;Resurrection Day.&apos; On Good Friday, people indulge in reading the holy Bible and connecting with God, Jesus Christ. Here are some beautiful Bible verses that you can read on this day and include joy and spirituality in your life.\nGood Friday Bible Verses\n1 Peter 2:24\nHe himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.\nJohn 3:16-17\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.\nMark 9:31\nFor he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, \"The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise.\nIsaiah 53:5\nBut he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds, we are healed.\nMark 10:34\nAnd they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him. And after three days he will rise.\nRomans 5:6-10\nFor while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person-though perhaps for a good person, one would dare even to die- but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.\nMark 8:31\nAnd he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again.\nMatthew 12:40\nFor just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\nJohn 19:30\nWhen Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, \"It is finished,\" and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.\nMatthew 17:22-23\nWhen they came together in Galilee, he said to them, &apos;The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised to life.&apos; And the disciples were filled with grief.\nMatthew 26:2\nAs you know, the Passover is two days away - and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.\nMatthew 26:12\nWhen she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.\nMatthew 26:24\nThe son of man will go just as it is written about him.\nMatthew 26:39\nGoing a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, &apos;My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.\nGood Friday 2024 Bible Verses (Image Credits: Freepik)",
