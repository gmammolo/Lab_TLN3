  "text": "Way of the Cross\nPics: Stanly Bantwal\nDaijiworld Media Network - Mangaluru\nMangaluru, Mar 29: In a solemn display of reverence and devotion, churches across Mangaluru observed Good Friday with the traditional Way of the Cross ceremonies. The faithful congregated in churches throughout the city to commemorate the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, a pivotal event in Christian theology.\nParticipants, adorned in sombre attire, gathered to retrace the final footsteps of Jesus, symbolically reliving his journey to Calvary. The Stations of the Cross, depicting significant events leading up to Christ's crucifixion, were fervently prayed upon by worshippers, evoking a sense of deep reflection and spiritual contemplation.\nThe priests emphasized the significance of Good Friday as a time for introspection, repentance, and renewal of faith. They encouraged worshippers to embody the teachings of Christ, fostering compassion, forgiveness, and unity within their communities.\nThe Way of the Cross ceremonies concluded with prayers for peace, healing, and redemption, resonating with the timeless message of hope and salvation heralded by Easter Sunday.\nThe main service on Good Friday begins after 4 pm in churches.\nThe church service will include reading of the Passion of Christ, reciting a string of prayers, unveiling and veneration of the Cross and communion service.\nDisclaimer:\nPlease write your correct name and email address.
