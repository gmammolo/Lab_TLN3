  "text": "Way of the Cross Pics: Stanly Bantwal Daijiworld Media Network - Mangaluru Mangaluru, Mar 29: In a solemn display of reverence and devotion, churches across Mangaluru observed Good Friday with the traditional Way of the Cross ceremonies. The faithful congregated in churches throughout the city to commemorate the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, a pivotal event in Christian theology. Participants, adorned in sombre attire, gathered to retrace the final footsteps of Jesus, symbolically reliving his journey to Calvary. The Stations of the Cross, depicting significant events leading up to Christ's crucifixion, were fervently prayed upon by worshippers, evoking a sense of deep reflection and spiritual contemplation. The priests emphasized the significance of Good Friday as a time for introspection, repentance, and renewal of faith. They encouraged worshippers to embody the teachings of Christ, fostering compassion, forgiveness, and unity within their communities. The Way of the Cross ceremonies concluded with prayers for peace, healing, and redemption, resonating with the timeless message of hope and salvation heralded by Easter Sunday. The main service on Good Friday begins after 4 pm in churches. The church service will include reading of the Passion of Christ, reciting a string of prayers, unveiling and veneration of the Cross and communion service. Praise the LORD. Jesus this beautiful way of the cross live really melts my heart.It was so touching. Jesus Christ is the only God who came to this earth in human form and sacrificed his life for the goodness of mankind. Glory be to God. The persecution which he was subjected to is seen in our country unfortunately in some areas. But God will not let us down. Praise be To God. The very God who brought his people out of the bondage of cruel pharaoh kings of Egypt will redeem the Christians facing persecution in present world... Hail the Lord... On this solemn day, may the cross be a symbol of hope, forgiveness & Salvation ... Disclaimer: Please write your correct name and email address.
