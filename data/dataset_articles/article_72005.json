  "text": "Ladysmith Gazette Local news\nHappy Easter to all our Christian readers\nIf you are going away for the long weekend, be safe on the roads\nGood Friday and Easter Sunday fall on March 29 (today) and March 31 respectively.\nRemember that it’s not about the Easter bunny, Easter eggs or hot-cross buns, but about Jesus Christ and the sacrifice He made for mankind.\nChristians observe Good Friday on the Friday before Easter Sunday. This commemorates Jesus Christ’s passion, crucifixion and death.\nEaster is also an occasion for family visits and spending quality time with one another.\nIf you are travelling, be safe on the roads and have yourself a fantastic long weekend!\nAlso read:\nCommunity faces water interruptions\nThe staff and management of the Ladysmith Gazette take this opportunity to wish all our readers a happy and blessed Easter.\nThe news provided to you in this link comes to you from the editorial staff of the Ladysmith Gazette, a sold newspaper distributed in the Ladysmith area.\nPlease follow us on our\nYouTube channel and do not be shy; please subscribe and comment as well.
