  "text": "Deadly road accident claims lives of two Indian students in Kazakhstan\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nTwo people were killed and three others seriously injured in a road accident that occurred on Jan. 6, 2026, on the outskirts of Almaty, according to the Indian Embassy in Kazakhstan.\nThe group — four students from the South Kazakhstan Medical Academy (SKMA) and one Indian tourist — was traveling from Shymkent to Almaty when the accident occurred. Two students, Karan Parmar and Rishiraj Baraith, both natives of Rajasthan, died at the scene from their injuries.\nThe three survivors were hospitalized with severe injuries and are currently in intensive care. Doctors are fighting to save the lives of students Manjeet Singh Solanki and Rahul Yadav, as well as tourist Brijeshkumar Bharatkumar Bhati.\nIndian diplomats have contacted the relatives of all those involved and are coordinating with Kazakhstani law enforcement agencies to provide necessary consular assistance. They also expressed their deepest condolences to the families of the victims.\nAccording to Kazakhstani authorities, the number of road accidents has been rising nationwide. During the first 11 months of 2025, 32,477 road accidents were registered in Kazakhstan, representing a 23.8% increase compared to the same period in 2024.",
