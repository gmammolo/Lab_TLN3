[Good Friday](https://www.thehansindia.com/tags/Good-Friday) stands as a pivotal moment in the Christian faith, marking the solemn commemoration of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. This day holds profound religious significance worldwide, reminding believers of the sacrifice made by Jesus for humanity's redemption. Despite its designation as \"Good\" Friday, it is a somber occasion, not one of celebration. Hence, it is advisable to refrain from expressing \"Happy Good Friday\" greetings. The Biblical Account According to the New Testament narrative, Jesus was crucified by the Romans on Good Friday following accusations of blasphemy for proclaiming himself the Son of God. Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, issued the order for his execution. The betrayal by Judas, one of his disciples, led to Jesus' arrest, subsequent trial, and crucifixion. The Events of Good Friday Legend holds that Jesus carried the cross to Calvary, where he was crucified, enduring immense suffering until his death. Good Friday serves as a time for Christians to reflect on the profound sacrifice and agony endured by Jesus. Easter Sunday: The Resurrection Easter Sunday, occurring the day after Good Friday, celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, as recounted in the New Testament. This pivotal event is believed to have occurred on the third day following Jesus' burial. While \"Good\" Friday may seem paradoxical given its solemn nature, the term \"good\" originally connoted piety or holiness in Old English. Inappropriate Greetings and Alternatives The solemnity of Good Friday renders greetings like \"Happy Good Friday\" inappropriate. Unlike festive occasions such as Christmas or Easter, Good Friday is a day of mourning and introspection. Christians typically observe this day by attending church services, contemplating Jesus' passion, and often fasting as a symbol of mourning. Rev. Dr. Brent Strawn, a professor of Old Testament at Duke Divinity School, aptly questions the appropriateness of describing the day of Jesus' death as \"good,\" considering its profound significance to believers. Choosing Thoughtful Messages Rather than expressing \"Happy Good Friday,\" it is more fitting to offer messages of reflection and empathy. Phrases like \"Have a blessed Good Friday\" or \"Thinking of you on this solemn day\" convey understanding and reverence for the occasion's importance to Christians. Good Friday holds immense religious significance, serving as a time for believers to reflect on Jesus Christ's sacrifice. As such, it is essential to approach this day with solemnity and respect, refraining from greetings that may misrepresent its meaning. Instead, let us offer thoughtful messages that acknowledge the gravity of Good Friday for Christians worldwide.",
