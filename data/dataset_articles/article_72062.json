  "text": "A university teacher, Professor Tajudeen Yusuf, has declared that the hardship in Nigeria is the handiwork of Nigerians. Professor Yusuf made this declaration in Ibadan at the fourth annual Ramadan lecture of the [Muslim](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/Muslim) Pharmacists Association of Nigeria (MPAN), Oyo State chapter. As part of its corporate social responsibility, MPAN provided free medical service and drugs to all attendees of the programme. The association’s da’wah coordinator, Mr Ganiyu Abideen, said the free health service would go a long way in bridging the healthcare provision and access gap and support the consistent effort of the government in ensuring that health services reach all residents of Oyo State. Professor Yusuf, renowned scholar of Islamic finance, said the country will go back on track if the citizens can apply the Islamic principles as enshrined in the Qur’an as antidotes to its ailments. “Banditry, kidnapping, violence, theft and insurgency are not divine curses from Allah. We are a people saddled with the responsibility of maintaining peace and justice in the land. We must live our lives to establish a just and peaceful nation,” the don said. The Mufti of the Zakat and Sadaqah Foundation, Lagos, Sheikh Tirimidhi Jamiu, remarked that zakat, a pillar of Islam “is not just a religious obligation but a means of forging a connection between the rich and the poor as well as their Lord.” Sheikh Jamiu highlighted the importance of zakat, noting that the hardship in Nigeria could be overcome with proper implementation of the institution of zakat. “By paying zakat and sadaqah, justice is automatically established in the land while the payer experiences a peaceful state of mind and purity of his wealth and soul,” he explained. This year’s MPAN lecture was graced by many pharmaceutical scholars, professional and entrepreneurs, including the co-chairman of the occasion, Alhaji Abdulrahman Oyewole Hameed; Mr Abdulrazaq Adeyanju, Director of Pharmacy and Head of Pharmacy Unit, Adeoyo Maternity Hospital, Yemetu, Ibadan; Mr Ganiyu Abideen Adedayo, Director of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Oyo State Hospital Management Board; Dr Fatimah Sanusi; Mr Taofiq Odukoya, Chief Executive Officer, Vanguards Pharmacy; Mr Oyeleye Lukuman, former Amir, MPAN, Oyo State; and Professor Lateef Bakre, the Sub-Dean, Faculty of Pharmacy, Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye.
