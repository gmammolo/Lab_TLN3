  "text": "Archbishop emphasises key role of Holy Communion ministers within the church Friday, 29 March 2024, 06:07 Last update: about 4 hours ago Archbishop Charles Scicluna expressed his profound gratitude to the Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion for their unwavering dedication and service within the parishes and broader communities. His acknowledgment came on Holy Thursday, a significant day commemorating Jesus Christ’s institution of the Sacrament of the Eucharist during the Last Supper. In a letter addressed to all ministers responsible for administering Holy Communion within the Archdiocese of Malta, Archbishop Scicluna highlighted the important role these ministers play in the Church. He emphasised that their mission extends beyond assisting during Mass; they also bring the Eucharist to the sick and homebound. ADVERTISEMENT The Archbishop told the ministers: “Please remember that your service is deeply appreciated and valued. Thank you for all you do to make the presence of Christ felt in our diocese. Your presence enriches our worship, and your efforts bring comfort and solace to those in need”. He also wished that Holy Thursday would serve as a time of reflection and renewal for them as they continue to serve with humility and love. The extraordinary ministers of communion are individuals recognised by the Church as spiritually prepared to handle the sacred duty of distributing the Eucharist. They undergo formation through a course provided by the Pastoral Formation Institute (PFI). This ministry shows compassion and care for the most vulnerable members of the community, demonstrating the love and presence of Christ tangibly.",
