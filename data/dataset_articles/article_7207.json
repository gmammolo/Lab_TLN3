  "text": "A fatal road accident at Asikuma, a community between the Bia West and Bia East districts in the Western North Region, has left six people dead and one other in critical condition.\nReports indicate that eight people were travelling on a tricycle, popularly known as aboboyaa, from Asuopiri in the Bia West District to Adabokrom in the Bia East District to engage in farming activities.\nOn reaching a sloping section of the road near Asikuma, a timber truck travelling from Adabokrom reportedly lost control and rammed into the tricycle.\nSix passengers died instantly, while another sustained serious injuries and was rushed to the Assamu Government Hospital for treatment.\nEyewitnesses said the tricycle rider managed to jump off moments before the collision and escaped, but his whereabouts are currently unknown. Some youth in the community have launched a search to locate him and ascertain his condition.\nThe driver of the timber truck has since reported himself to the Dabeso District Police Command. Police officers have visited the scene, conveyed the bodies to the morgue, and begun investigations into the incident.",
