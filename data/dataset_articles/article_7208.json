  "text": "Two fatal accidents just after the start of the new year bring the number of total fatalities on Wyoming roads to two in 2026, up from just one in 2025, according to statistics provided by the Wyoming Highway Patrol.\nGavin Stanek, 55, of Casper and George Garland, 75, of Wheatland were involved in separate fatal accidents in the first week of 2026.\nGARLAND\nOn Jan. 4, Garland was heading southbound on Highway 310 when he approached a “T” intersection at Reservoir Road. He left the street before sliding down an embankment and into Wheatland Reservoir No. 1 in a 2013 Chevy Cruze. The vehicle became submerged.\nTroopers were dispatched to the accident just after 9 a.m. A combination of excess speed and a disability are believed to have contributed to the accident, according to Wyoming Highway Patrol reports.\nGarland died at the scene.\nSTANEK\nThe next day, on Jan. 5, Stanek, in a separate incident, was heading northbound on I-25 at mile marker 156 roughly 10 miles east of Glenrock. His 2004 Cadillac Escalade struck a retaining wall before flipping over it, eventually settling on its roof at the bank of the North Platte River before being consumed by fire.\nState police were dispatched at 9:15 p.m. to the accident. According to Wyoming Highway Patrol, driver fatigue is believed to be the cause. Stanek did not survive the accident.\nTroopers said drugs and alcohol are not contributing factors in the fatalities.",
