  "text": "President William Ruto has shared a message of hope, ushering in the Easter holidays.\nTaking to social media, the Head of State urged Kenyans to join Christian faithful in reflecting on lessons from one of the religion’s significant historical events.\n“The time has come once again for all people of goodwill, in Kenya and abroad, to join the Christian faithful in reflecting on the enduring and universal lessons from one of the most significant events in the history of our faith,” Ruto said on X.\nThe president added that Easter is a period of commemoration, of the painful sacrifices and intense suffering endured by Jesus Christ.\n“We recall with great sorrow the hardship, struggle, betrayal, persecution, torture, crucifixion and death suffered by Christ on our behalf, with the understanding that His descent into the place of death set the stage for His victory over death,” he said.\nAcknowledging the existing challenges in the world today, Ruto noted that the Easter period serves as a reminder that any adversity can be overcome through discipline and sound values.\n“There is no life, place or time in this world without its share of sufferings, deprivations and frustrations. The Easter message of hope tells us as individuals that we too can triumph over adversity, transcend our challenges and find happiness, success and prosperity in our lifetime,” the president said, in part.\nCalling on Kenyans to follow the example set by Jesus, Ruto said the divine model of faith displayed through his suffering and ultimate death should inspire nation-building and service to humanity.\n\"Let us, therefore, contemplate the divine example of our Lord, who endured the worst suffering and ultimate loss in order to achieve an unprecedented triumph, which has inspired thousands of generations, billions of people in hundreds of nations throughout the world.\" \"Let us apply the sacred lesson, that from the very bottom, in a tomb, our Teacher and Saviour rose up victoriously and went up to partake of the glory of Heaven, ” said the President.\nTags: Citizen Digital Easter Citizen TV Kenya Want to send us a story?
