  "text": "EASTERN Cape police came together to ask for divine intervention. Nelson Mandela Bay District police officers held a pre-Easter Service at the Presbyterian Church of Africa in Motherwell on Friday, 22 March. The service was attended by community members, churches, and different units within the police department. The service intended to pray for the end of murders, to restore morals, and to end corruption within the police. They also prayed for the health and wellness of members during the Easter holidays. District commissioner Major-General Vuyisile Ncata said: \"We are holding a pre-Easter prayer service because, as police in this region, we believe that in order to win the battle against crime, we need to be close to Jesus Christ and also have the fear of the Lord. \"We are dealing with a type of crime that is no longer just physical, and as police alone, we will not be able to win this battle. Therefore, we are collaborating with all the organisations in the district, and we believe that the Lord will help us in the fight against crime,\" he said.

Also, as police officers, we also want to be prayed for so that we do not become criminals ourselves and do not conflict with the law. \"We also pray for peace and pray for no crime. We pray for wisdom and knowledge as we lead, especially currently. This is a very busy and difficult period in our country,” he said. Ncata added that criminals needed to find them ready, strong, and empowered with Christ. Nelson Mandela District Spiritual Crime Chairperson Luvuyo Rheza said: \"It’s very painful to see our people destroying each other. We believe prayer is powerful. Prayer brings unity to our communities and love for each other. \"We are praying to God to protect us and our children from this [murders] evil spirit. These are the last days that we are living in, which is why we are encouraging the community to pray together and overcome these evil spirits among the people,\" he said.
