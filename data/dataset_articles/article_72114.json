  "text": "THE Easter weekend is a time where Christians go to the church and celebrate the death and resurrection of their king, Jesus Christ. However, not everyone will go to church during that weekend. The Ingoma yePhasika Festival wants to accommodate those people by creating a platform for them to worship and praise God through traditional dance music. The traditional dance festival will see 10 groups from Durban performing at kaXimba in Mkhambathini, west of Durban on Saturday, 30 March. Speaking to Daily Sun, event organiser Ngqengelele Khomo said: “We want those who won’t attend the Easter church services to come to Ingoma yePhasika to worship God and Jesus with their dancing talent. Others will enjoy witnessing others dancing because God is worshiped in many ways. “This is not actually a competition but is just a festival where 10 groups will share the stage. Fans will be the ones who will judge who is the best while they will enjoy meat as we are going to slaughter a number of cows,” he said.

He said another reason they're hosting this festival is to encourage the youth to be proud of their culture and heritage. “We encourage those who will attend it to dress traditionally, according to their culture and heritage. “We've hosted this festival three times since we started it in 2019, and we're seeing improvement every year,” he said. He said the event will be attended by guests from eThekwini and Mkhambathini municipalities, as well as councillors, izinduna and amakhosi. The event will start at 1pm and continue until late.
