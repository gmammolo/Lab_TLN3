  "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: On Good Friday, church pews were packed with Christians observing the holy day.\nDean of the St Mary’s Anglican Cathedral here, the Very Reverend Dr Andrew Cheah, said that Good Friday was an important day for Christians nationwide.\n“Good Friday is really important for us, Christians, to remember that Jesus died for us.\nHe said services at the church had started on Maundy Thursday (March 28), followed by Good Friday, Easter Eve and Easter Sunday services.\n\"We are having extra services this year because we have to renovate the front part of the church,\" he said.\nHe noted that on Maundy Thursday, there were more members attending this year compared to last year due to the public holiday.\nIt is a busy Easter week for church staff and Cheah will only celebrate with his family after Easter.\nReverend Andy Ng said that the turnout for the Good Friday service was around 600 to 700, which was very encouraging.\n“I know many people took half-day leave to attend,” he said.\nDuring the 11am service, the congregation sang hymns as the pipe organ played in the background.\nAttendees read the Scripture together, knelt to confess their sins and listened to reflections shared by the pastors.\n\"The season of Lent invites us to contemplate and respond to this great act of salvation through prayer, reading of the Bible, fasting and acts of charity,” said the Right Rev Dr Steven Abarrow in the first reflection session.\nAfter the Good Friday service, the quiet church burst to life as members chatted with one another.\nHot cross buns were distributed and shared as a reminder of the faith.\nOpen Modal × Follow us on our official WhatsApp channel for breaking news alerts and key updates!
