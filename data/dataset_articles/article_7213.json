  "text": "One person drowned and nearly 100 were rescued as lifeguards worked 14-hour shifts to protect holidaymakers along the KwaDukuza coast.\nKwaDukuza lifeguard superintendent Bongani Xulu confirmed that a 40-year-old Indian man from Newcastle, visiting with his family, drowned at Thompson’s Bay in Ballito.\nHe had entered the water early on Friday morning with a friend when both were swept out to sea. A local fisherman managed to rescue the friend, but the missing man’s body had not been recovered at the time of going to print.\nJet skis and drones were used in the search, which involved KwaDukuza lifeguards and IPSS Search and Rescue teams combing the shoreline.\nIn another serious incident, a 22-year-old Thembeni resident suffered a spinal injury after diving headfirst into a shallow section of a swimming pool in Tinley Manor.\n“Besides these incidents, lifeguards performed at least 100 rescues, including mass rescues, at various beaches along the coastline,” said Xulu.\nHe said many rescues were linked to sandbanks, which can be particularly dangerous for inexperienced swimmers.\n“I am very proud of the KwaDukuza marine team. They have been working 13 to 14-hour shifts to ensure swimmers’ safety,” said Xulu.\nHe thanked safety role players including IPSS Medical Rescue, Saps and private security companies for their swift and co-ordinated response.\n“Whenever incidents occurred, we responded swiftly and mobilised all available resources. This teamwork shows visitors that we are ready to assist. I truly appreciate the collaboration.”\nXulu also thanked the municipality management and council for employing an additional 55 seasonal lifeguards.\n“This made a real difference, especially as swimmer numbers have increased compared to past seasons after Covid-19.”",
