  "text": "The Light Within: The lonely can know God’s presence It’s ironic, but one can feel lonely when by oneself or among others. That’s why, I believe, one can be lifted out of loneliness no matter the surroundings. David was encouraged to trust in God when he felt alone: “Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God …” (Psalms 43:5). Christ Jesus experienced loneliness when he was praying with his disciples in Gethsemane. He found them sleeping, then asked, “… couldest not thou watch one hour?” (Mark 14:37). He went away and prayed, but when he returned, he found them asleep again (Mark 14:39-40). But he knew his peace would come from God. This promise from Christ Jesus is most reassuring, particularly when we feel alone: “…lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world” (Matthew 28:20). I believe that if we truly become quiet, then turn our thought to God, we can feel the presence of God’s love when alone or with others.

How important! Even a friendly nod to a passer-by might be a little uplifting for that person. Like so many of you, I have contacted others who might feel lonely. Their reactions so often have been sheer delight and appreciation. This thoughtfulness is a step in easing one’s loneliness for that day and possibly beyond. Again, we can heed Christ Jesus’ promise, “…lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.” With consistency, this reassurance may give us the peace that we are not alone. — Don Kleinsmith is a member of the Christian Science Church in Adrian.
