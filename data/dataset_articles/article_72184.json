  "text": "President Bola Tinubu on Friday commended Nigerians for their sacrifices in the past few months for the nation to be steered to the path of recovery and sustainable growth. Tinubu said this in a statement by his Spokesperson, Ajuri Ngelale, to celebrate Easter. He assured Nigerians that the seeds of patience that they have sown are beginning to sprout and will in no time bring forth an abundance of good fruits. The President who joined the Christian faithful to commemorate Easter, a significant moment and a glorious celebration of the triumph of life over death, also extended greetings to Christians in Nigeria and around the world on the occasion, emphasizing love, sacrifice, and compassion as the patent themes of the solemn season. Sending his best wishes to Nigerians, Tinubu noted that the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for humanity is an emphatic lesson for leaders and all Nigerians to yield to selflessness and compassion, and be steadfast in the pursuit of a united, peaceful, and prosperous nation. As Christians celebrate the victory of life over death as exemplified by the resurrection of Christ, Tinubu assured the citizens that Nigeria will triumph over its challenges as his administration remains firmly committed to this end. 0 Comments [cancel reply](/news/easter-tinubu-hails-nigerians-sacrifice-for-nation/#respond) You must be logged in to post a comment.
