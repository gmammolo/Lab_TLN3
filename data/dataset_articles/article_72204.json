  "text": "Solar Eclipse 2024: Hindu Mythology Has The Perfect Explanation Why Rahu Attacks The Sun Solar eclipse is on April 8, 2024. As per the Hindu mythology, during this time the Rahu swallows the Sun. To know why Rahu seeks revenge from the Sun, read the story here. (Picture Credit: Canva) Solar eclipse (or Surya Grahan) holds a special significance in Hindu culture. It is said solar eclipses are said to have an impact on cosmic forces. This is why people tend to observe fast, take bath in holy rivers and perform prayers to reduce the negative impact of the eclipses. Solar eclipse is round the corner and is on April 8. It is said one should refrain from doing anything positive during this time to escape the effect of negative energies. From staying indoors, avoiding eating and drinking anything during the eclipse to devoting time to prayers, these are just some of the do’s and don’ts one should observe during solar eclipses. As per the Hindu mythology, the story that goes around involves Rahu and Ketu, the two shadow planets. It is said that during Samudra Manthan (the churning of the ocean of milk), Rahu drank the nectar of immortality. Both Surya (the Sun) and Chandra (the Moon) on seeing demon Rahu drinking nectar in a disguised form alert Lord Vishnu, who was distributing the nectar in the avatar of Mohini. Enraged, Lord Vishnu beheaded Rahu through his sudarshan chakra. Since Rahu had already consumed a drop of nectar, his head (Rahu) became immortal while his body (Ketu) died. This explains why Rahu and Ketu keep seeking revenge from the Sun and the Moon from time to time. In fact, did you know our ancestors could even calculate the time of solar eclipses? As per the belief, Rahu and Ketu seek revenge on Sun and Moon, causing solar and lunar eclipses, respectively. Ever wondered why solar eclipses last for some time only? Well, even though Rahu swallows the Sun during a solar eclipse, but since it doesn’t have the body to digest it, the rays of the Sun shine bright on Earth again. Interesting, isn't it?
