  "text": "Man left hospitalised after serious collision in Basildon\nPolice urge public to help investigations after fail-to-stop incident on East Mayne\nA man has been left seriously injured and remains in hospital following a collision in Basildon.\nThe incident occurred at around 11pm on Tuesday 30th December on East Mayne as a silver Volkswagen Jetta headed southbound.\nAnother person involved in the crash left the scene before police arrived. He was later found and treated for injuries in hospital.\nPolice are appealing to the public for help as investigations continue. Officers have stated they don’t believe any other vehicles were involved.\nPolice appeal for dashcam and CCTV footage\nPC Charles Cooke said: “I’d like to thank everyone who has already been in touch and provided us with footage relating to this incident – we really want to hear from anyone else who may know something and hasn’t already spoken to us.\n“You may have dashcam footage from the area around the time of the collision, you might have CCTV footage or you may have seen something. No matter how small, the information you have could be crucial.\n“We’re continuing to pursue several lines of enquiry, and we don’t believe any other vehicles were involved in this incident.\n“I’d ask everyone not to speculate about this collision, and if there’s anything you know the best thing to do is to give us a call.”\nHow to share information\nAnyone with information about the collision is encouraged to submit a report on the police website or use the online Live Chat service, which is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nAlternatively, you can call 101 quoting incident number 1234 of Tuesday 30th December.\nAnonymous reports can be made to the independent charity Crimestoppers by visiting their website or by calling 0800 555 111.",
