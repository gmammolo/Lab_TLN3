  "text": "Daily Devotional: The Cross in the Woods \"After this, when Jesus knew that all was now finished, he said (in order to fulfill the scripture), 'I am thirsty.' A jar full of sour wine was standing there. So they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the wine, he said, 'It is finished.' Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.\" — John 19:28-30 NRSVUE Just a few miles from where Kathy and I lived in Northern Michigan is the Cross in the Woods. On a beautiful site adjacent to the Burt Lake State Park there is erected the world’s largest crucifix. The bronze statue of Christ weighs over seven tons. It is placed on a wooden cross, and is truly spectacular. If you are traveling in the area, it’s definitely worth a stop. At one time, some of us were walking through the wooded grounds. One of my friends, upon looking up at the great statue, remarked, “You know, I really like that kind of cross. It reminds me that Jesus suffered for me.” I understand what he was saying, but after careful consideration, have come to realize I prefer the empty cross. It reminds us that His suffering is over, and that our sin was paid once and for all. It reminds us that Jesus finished what He started. And that the great work He has begun in us, He will also finish. There are days I really need to remember that, how ‘bout you. Prayer: Lord, thank You for finishing what You started. Have faith. It all comes right. Rev. Dr. Michael Sanders has published books of devotions. They are available at Ken’s Village Market in Indian River and Brewed Awakenings in Saline.",
