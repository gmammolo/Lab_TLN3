  "text": "Good Friday And Easter Sunday 2024:Christians around the world place great importance on sharing verses from the Bible during Good Friday and Easter. These verses convey the main concepts of Jesus Christ&apos;s death, burial, and resurrection. Easter celebrates Jesus&apos; triumphant resurrection, signifying new life and eternal hope, while Good Friday remembers his crucifixion, emphasizing themes of atonement and forgiveness.\nSharing these verses encourages self-awareness, growth in faith, and unity among believers. It also serves as a reminder of the key moments in the history of the Christian religion. By sharing these verses, believers engage in a custom that fortifies their faith, expands their understanding of God&apos;s love, and extends an invitation to others to experience the significance and joy of these holy days. For these special days, we have compiled a list of Bible verses that you can share with your loved ones.\nThinking of you on this special day! Best wishes for Easter and the season ahead. (Image Credit: Freepik)\nGood Friday 2024 Bible Verses\nMark 8:31\nAnd he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again.\n1 Peter 3:18\nFor Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit.\nMark 10:34\nwho will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise.\"\nMay the Almighty shower you and your loved ones with the choicest blessings. Sending warm wishes on Good Friday to you! (Image Credit: Freepik)\nMatthew 12:40\nFor as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\nRomans 5:6-10\nFor while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person-though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die- but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.\n1 Peter 2:24\nHe himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.\nMark 9:31\nFor he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, \"The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise.\"\nI pray that the love of Jesus will always fill your heart with divine happiness. (Image Credit: Freepik)\nMark 10:34\nAnd they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him. And after three days he will rise.\n1 Peter 2:24\n\"He himself bore our sins\" in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; \"by his wounds you have been healed.\"\nI wish you a solemn Good Friday and pray that your faith never wavers from God. (Image Credit: Freepik)\nIsaiah 53:5\nBut he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed.\nEaster Sunday 2024 Bible Verses\nMatthew 28:5-8\nThe angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples: &apos;He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.&apos; Now I have told you.\" So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.\n1 Peter 1:3\nBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.\nHappy Easter to my favorite Peeps! (Image Credit: Freepik)\n1 Thessalonians 4:14\nFor since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep.\nRomans 8:11\nIf the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.\nJohn 11:25-26\nJesus said to her, \"I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?\"\nFaith makes all things possible. (Image Credit: Freepik)\nJohn 6:40\nFor this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.\"\n1 Corinthians 6:14\nAnd God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.\nRomans 8:34\n34 Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died-more than that, who was raised to life-is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.\nJohn 3:16\nFor God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\nRomans 6:4\nWe were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.\nHappy Easter! May this day be as special and beautiful as you. (Image Credit: Freepik)\nIsaiah 26:19\nYour dead shall live; their bodies shall rise. You who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For your dew is a dew of light, and the earth will give birth to the dead.\nRomans 6:4\n4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.\nPhilippians 3:10\nThat I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death",
