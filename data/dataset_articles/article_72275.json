  "text": "We should embrace religious pluralism in a divided world\nPeople should see religious pluralism as a pathway to unity and understanding.\nBy GRANT OH\n(Gloria Jin / Daily Trojan)\nPeople should see religious pluralism as a pathway to unity and understanding.\n(Gloria Jin / Daily Trojan)\nIn today’s interconnected world, the tapestry of human civilization is woven with a myriad of beliefs and traditions. It’s in this rich mosaic that we find the essence of religious pluralism — a celebration of diversity, a call for understanding and a pathway to unity.\nReligious pluralism invites us to envision a world where differences are bridges, not barriers. It fosters conversations that enrich and grow us, where respect, empathy and dialogue flourish, connecting us in our shared humanity. At its core, it’s about recognizing the worth of every belief, going beyond tolerance to genuine acceptance and celebration of our diverse spiritual landscape. It urges us to transcend boundaries, engage with openness and curiosity, and celebrate the richness of our collective heritage.\nBut religious pluralism is more than just a lofty ideal; it has tangible benefits for individuals, communities and societies at large. By embracing religious diversity, we can create spaces where everyone feels valued and respected, regardless of their faith background. This sense of inclusivity fosters a sense of belonging and cohesion, thus laying the groundwork for stronger, more resilient communities.\nBeyond inclusion, religious pluralism can serve as a catalyst for dialogue and understanding, breaking down the barriers of ignorance and prejudice that often divide us. When individuals from different faith traditions come together in respectful conversation, they discover common ground, shared values and a deeper appreciation for one another’s perspectives. This dialogue not only promotes mutual understanding but also strengthens social bonds, forging connections that transcend religious and cultural divides.\nEmbracing religious pluralism is a deeply human endeavor — one that calls upon us to confront our own biases and preconceptions, to challenge the narratives of division and otherness that pervade our societies, and to strive for a more inclusive and compassionate world. It requires us to listen with an open heart, to learn from one another’s experiences, and to recognize the inherent dignity and worth of every individual, regardless of their religious affiliation.\nIn a world grappling with complex challenges — from poverty and inequality to violent conflict, exemplified by, for example, the longstanding Israel-Palestine conflict before and during Israel’s war in Gaza, that arise from differing ideologies — religious pluralism can offer a unique opportunity to harness the collective wisdom and resources of diverse faith traditions. By drawing on the ethical teachings of various religions, societies can mobilize collective action toward tackling these pressing issues. Together, they pave a path toward a future marked by fairness, equality and sustainability.\nOf course, embracing religious pluralism is not without its challenges. In the broader context of societal issues, religion often becomes a battleground where factions vie to assert their superiority and righteousness. It’s a recurring theme: a need to establish who holds the moral high ground and whose beliefs are the most “authentic.”\nPluralism requires us to navigate the complexities of cultural, religious and political differences to confront the discomfort that comes with stepping outside of our usual spheres and to engage in difficult conversations about faith, identity and belonging. But the rewards are immeasurable. In a world where division seems to be the norm, religious pluralism offers a glimmer of hope — a reminder that despite our differences, we are all bound together by our shared humanity.\nAs we navigate the complexities of today, let us embrace religious pluralism not as an abstract concept but as a lived reality. Let us commit ourselves to building bridges instead of walls, to seeking understanding instead of division and to celebrating the beautiful tapestry of beliefs that makes our world so wonderfully diverse. In embracing religious pluralism, let us shed tears of gratitude for what binds us, for it is in this tender communion that we can find solace, inspiration and the transformative power of love.\nWe are the only independent newspaper here at USC, run at every level by students. That means we aren’t tied down by any other interests but those of readers like you: the students, faculty, staff and South Central residents that together make up the USC community.\nIndependence is a double-edged sword: We have a unique lens into the University’s actions and policies, and can hold powerful figures accountable when others cannot. But that also means our budget is severely limited. We’re already spread thin as we compensate the writers, photographers, artists, designers and editors whose incredible work you see in our daily paper; as we work to revamp and expand our digital presence, we now have additional staff making podcasts, videos, webpages, our first ever\nmagazine and social media content, who are at risk of being unable to receive the support they deserve.\nWe are therefore indebted to readers like you, who, by supporting us, help keep our paper daily (we are the only remaining college paper on the West Coast that prints every single weekday), independent, free and widely accessible.\nPlease consider supporting us. Even $1 goes a long way in supporting our work; if you are able, you can also support us with monthly, or even annual, donations. Thank you.\nThis site uses cookies.
