  "text": "\"In this Good Friday commemoration, we learn about love and sacrifice,\" he said in a post on his official Instagram account here on Friday. According to the minister, the teaching of love has helped develop brotherhood between Indonesian citizens regardless of differences in ethnicity, race, religion, and group. \"I want to quote God's word that 'As I have loved you, so you also must love one another,'\" he said. He invited the diverse community in the country to coexist peacefully to support greater national development in the future. Furthermore, Pandjaitan said that Easter Day is a reminder of faith and hope for people. \"God never forsakes His people. So, on this occasion, let us unite in prayer, reflect on His great sacrifice for the salvation of mankind,\" he added. He then invited people to reflect on and follow those values in daily life and decisions, both in their social and personal lives. \"I, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, and my family wish you a happy commemoration of the three holy days, which are Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter Day, for Christians throughout Indonesia,\" he said. On Friday, as many as 500 congregants participated in the \"Way of the Cross\" at the Jakarta Cathedral. Public relation staff of the Jakarta Archdiocese and the Jakarta Cathedral, Susyana Suwadie, said that the Cathedral Church held the Good Friday service, which included a devotional procession about the story of Christ's death.
