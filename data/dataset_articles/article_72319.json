  "text": "Noah Lyles is one of the sprint athletes who etched close to the topmost benchmark established by Usain Bolt in the 100m run by clinching a 9.83 seconds record in comparison to Bolt’s 9.58. However, some recent revelations of this year’s anticipated world record athlete called attention to his biggest flaws in return. Amidst all disclosures, Usain Bolt too, is of a belief that Noah Lyles can be one of the contenders to break the world record this time in the Paris Olympics 2024. While Noah Lyles comprises the same dynamism as Usain Bolt, to win in the Summer Olympics this time, he hopes to etch his name in both 100m and 200m, surpassing the record that was formerly Usain Bolt’s.\nNoah Lyles’ biggest mistake that could hinder his way to success ADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nUnderestimating the rest, Noah Lyles, according to Rodney Green explained Usain Bolt’s view in a recent interview by Ready Set Go in a YouTube Podcast. He said that the 8X Olympic gold medalist had explained, “He (Noah Lyles) often underestimates the rounds of the 100m, in comparison to the 200m.” Though he added that the possibilities are in favor of the 200, it’s stacked up against him in the 100.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nTrending “Really Struggling”: Patrick Mahomes’ Wife Brittany Provides Worrying Health Update March 27, 2024 11:35 PM EEST\n‘Fu*in Clowns’: Martin Truex Jr Urges Joe Gibbs to ‘Find a New Fu*in Driver’ in Fiery COTA Rant March 28, 2024 12:09 AM EEST\n“Beast Is Coming”: Brock Lesnar WrestleMania XL Return Expected Online After Rumored Reference During Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson & Cody Rhodes Fight March 28, 2024 01:30 PM EEST\nAfter Deion Sanders Jr.’s Shiny $79K Purchase, Shedeur & Shilo Follow Their Brother’s Footsteps to Flaunt New Beast March 26, 2024 07:13 PM EEST\nBrock Lesnar Seemingly Teased in Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson & Cody Rhodes RAW Segment Amid WrestleMania XL Return Rumors March 28, 2024 12:51 PM EEST\nGet instantly notified of the hottest Olympics stories via Google!

Confident to achieve his goal this time, he sights his eyes on the 2024 Paris Olympics this season . Not to forget, in his recent interview with the CNN Sports, Noah Lyles had said, “ We worked on the 60 to help my 100 and my 200 and we’ve seen major progression in that. ”\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nAiming to expand his athletic portfolio, Noah Lyles’s goal is to compete for four golds this season – 100m, 200m, 4x100m , and 4x400m races, a record which even Usain Bolt didn’t ever achieve during the same event. “ He was the fastest man ever to do it, and soon, it’ll be me.” , the American sprinter exclaimed with a sarcastic grin on his face,\nNoah Lyles Discloses the Exact Moment That Wrote the ‘Biggest’ Part of His Career",
