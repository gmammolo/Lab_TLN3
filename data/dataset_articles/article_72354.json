  "text": "And [Moses] took the fat, the tail, all the fat which was on the innards, the diaphragm of the liver, the two kidneys together with their fat and the right thigh. ~ Leviticus 8:25 I’m a fan of the evolution of Judaism. We started in tents set up in a promised land and eventually ended up in Egypt. We sat at a mountain for a while and received new, detailed, instructions. We took a long walk and eventually ended up back at our original campground. We built a Temple and showed up three times a year to follow the detailed instructions. The neighbors became occupiers became evictors and we had to set up shop in the old country back when it was still the new country. We wrote so much down about how to do what we should do. Some of us grew mighty beards. Along the way, electricity was invented and we found ourselves in the new new country. Some of us just call it the country. Our beards were not as fashionable here so many of us shaved them off. We put up multiple buildings in the same neighborhood so we could choose the right one for our new-fangled sensibilities. These changes keep happening, like when the famous folk singer picked up an electric guitar. Some people followed him into that building and others stayed in the old one. I love the tradition of the old building but am happy to not have to interact with the innards of a ram anymore. Let Judaism go electric if it needs to. We can unplug whenever we want.
