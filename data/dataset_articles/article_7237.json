  "text": "News Brief\nArjun Brij\nJan 08, 2026 | Updated 11:10 AM GMT+5:30\nSave & read from anywhere!\nBookmark stories for easy access on any device or the Swarajya app.\nKochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) is working against the clock to complete and commission the first stretch of Phase II of the Metro’s Pink Line, linking Jawaharlal Nehru (JLN) Stadium with Infopark, by 30 June this year.\nWhile construction activity has picked up pace in recent months, slow progress on key civil works has raised concerns over whether the ambitious timeline can be met, Times of India reported.\nPiling work along the corridor is nearing completion, with around 80 per cent achieved. However, viaduct construction stands at roughly 30 per cent, and pier works have progressed to only 37 per cent, creating uncertainty around the project schedule.\n“It’s a challenging task ahead, but we’re leaving no stone unturned to open the first five stations by the middle of this year. We’ve already floated tenders for key works, including supply of a third rail traction system. However, adequate funding is crucial for speedy implementation,” a senior metro official was quoted as saying by TOI.\nOfficials pointed to delays in securing foreign funding as a major bottleneck.\nApproval is still pending for a Rs 1,116 crore loan from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, with the state government concerned about its impact on borrowing limits and other development projects.\nDespite the hurdles, KMRL says construction has intensified. Piling work has been completed at stations including Palarivattom, Alinchuvadu, Vazhakala, Chembumukku, SEZ, Kinfra and Civil Station Junction, while work is ongoing at Infopark and Padamugal. Pier construction has been completed at several of these locations.\nThe 11.2 km elevated Phase II corridor, featuring 11 stations, was originally slated for completion by the end of 2025, later revised to December this year.\nKMRL has now prioritised opening the first section up to Padamugal by 30 June. Afcons Infrastructure Ltd is executing the Rs 1,141.32 crore civil works contract.\nArjun Brij is an Editorial Associate at Swarajya. He tweets at @arjun_brij",
