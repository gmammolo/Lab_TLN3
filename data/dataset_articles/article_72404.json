On Good Friday, Lord Jesus offered his life to God on the cross. Although he was innocent, he was hanged on the cross as punishment. Father Antony Swamy SVD said, “After becoming an adult, Lord Jesus always gave the message of humanity and peace to the people.” However, some religious scholars accused him of contempt of religion and sentenced him to death. “He did not blame those who punished him but said, 'O God, forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing’,” Swamy added.",
