  "text": "Four college students lost their lives, and one was seriously injured in a road accident at Mokila in Telangana’s Ranga Reddy district on late Wednesday night, shortly after attending a birthday celebration. The tragic incident happened around 1 am on Thursday when the group was travelling from Mokila towards Narsingi. According to police, five students were travelling in a speeding SUV when the driver lost control of the vehicle. The car first hit a road divider and then crashed into a tree with great force. The impact was so severe that four students died on the spot, and the vehicle was badly damaged. The deceased have been identified as Kargayala Sumith (20), a final-year BBA student at ICFAI Business School (IBS) and a resident of Kokapet; Sri Nikhil (20), also a final-year BBA student at IBS from Manchirevula; Devala Surya Teja (20), a second-year BBA student at IBS, originally from Mancherial; and Balmuri Rohith (18), an engineering student at MGIT, residing in Kokapet. Sumith, who was driving the car, was celebrating his birthday earlier that night. The only survivor, Sunkari Nakshatra (20), a final-year BBA student at IBS, suffered critical injuries in the accident. She was immediately rushed to a private hospital in Hyderabad, where doctors said her condition remains unstable. Police officials said it is not yet clear whether drunk driving played a role in the accident. An investigation has been launched to find out the exact cause. The bodies of the deceased students were shifted to Chevella Government Hospital for postmortem examination.\",",
