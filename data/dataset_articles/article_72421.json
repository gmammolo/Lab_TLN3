  "text": "Rajshahi, known for its high-quality silk production, is humming with silk buyers on the eve of Eid-ul-Fitr, one of the biggest religious festivals for Muslims, which has given rise to a surge in the demand for silk attire. Due to the silk clothing’s striking colour and pattern, many people—especially teenagers—are swarming the showrooms to pick out their top picks. Consequently, workers at the silk manufacturers are working through their busiest hours on both days and nights. Additionally, the BSCIC’s silk factories run nonstop. Silk fabrics, woven and designed by local artisans, are in huge demand in the Eid markets of the city, with affluent people rushing to the silk showrooms every day. The top pick for buyers, according to Sapura Silk showroom in-charge Saidur Rahman, is katoar shari of muslin, which sells for between Taka 3,500 and Taka 1,50,000. He added that the showrooms assembled children’s outfits, punjabees, three-piece suits, and sharis made of silk. Usha Silk has also brought a new design with stripe which is being sold at Taka 1,900 to Taka 6,500 per piece, sellers added. During the Eid holiday, silk producers such as Sapura Silk, Usha Silk, Rajshahi Silk Fashion, Amena Silk, and Mohananda Silk are busy introducing new silk clothing patterns and hues.",
