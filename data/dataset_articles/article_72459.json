  "text": "TROY, N.Y. — Kingdom Ministries invites one and all to their 14th annual free community Easter dinner this Sunday.\nThe meal will be offered at 1:30 pm, at Christ Church on 35 State Street. This year it is being served as an Italian family-style meal, prepared by people Kingdom Ministries president Billy Carter describes as “the best cooks in the Capital District.” Everyone is welcome to attend.\nDesserts will be provided by Bella Napoli, thanks to generous support from Dominic Mainella.\nThe meal is being prepared by Peter Enzien, Joe Anne Enzien, Antoinette Schnellbacher, Susan France, Luanne Vazzana, Pasqua Leno, Michael Yamin, and Antoinette Yamin.\n“The holiday dinners were started to honor Jesus Christ and bring people into a relationship with him through our service and the fact that there was no place to go for community in Troy and food if you were lonely,” Carter said. “We wanted there to be a place for happiness and the love of God to shine through, and God answered my prayer.”\nIn addition to free food for 200 people, Kingdom Ministries will also have gently used clothes and housewares available to anyone that needs them.\n“We are so grateful to our donors, Troy Savings Bank Music Hall, Nite Owl News, Louis Coplin, Lee Groff, Haven Brown, Bishop William Love, Troy Firefighters Union, Peg Walsh, Rodney and Jolene Wiltshire, and Victorious Life Church,” Carter said. “I also want to give thanks to my wonderful beautiful wife Lucille, who always always gathers donations and helps in so many ways.”\nFor more information, contact Billy Carter at 518-935-7377.",
