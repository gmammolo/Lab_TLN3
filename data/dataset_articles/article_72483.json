  "text": "Kwara State governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has rejoiced with the Christian community in the state and across Nigeria on the occasion of this year’s Easter celebration.\nThe governor, in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye, said Easter evokes the time-tested themes of love, sacrifice, compassion, unity, and triumph of good over evil at different times.\nAbdulRazaq noted that the sacrifice of Jesus Christ to guide the flock, and the enduring legacy he left for humanity calls for deeper reflection at this time and always.\nHe urged citizens to seize the moment to renew their faith in God, unite for national and collective growth, and to help one another to uphold goodness and justice in the world.\nThe governor wishes the Christian community a happy Easter celebration.",
