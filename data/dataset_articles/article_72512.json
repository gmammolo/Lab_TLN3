  "text": "KAKATA — Former President George M. Weah’s special aide and a native of Margibi County, Sekou Kalasco Damaro, has donated assorted food items and cash to Muslims of Margibi County to show solidarity as Muslims observe the Holy Month of Ramadan. By: Yawah Y. Jaivey, Contributor The items donated include 100 bags of 25kg of rice, 10 cartoons of chicken, 10 cartoons of fish and LD$300,000 (Liberian Dollar Three Hundred Thousand). Making the presentation at the Lango Town Mosque on Thursday in Kakata, Mr. Damaro, who himself a Muslim, said his gesture is in no way to boast of being wealthy but a rightful religious obligation to do for Muslims jamia (gathering) especially during the observance of Ramadan. “I don’t have money and all I am doing today is not to show off that I have money but we as Muslims know that giving is one of the pillars of Islam. In Islam anyone who believes there is a tomorrow is good to soul your seed today,” he asserted. He at the same time used the occasion to admonish the gathering comprising of Islamic clerics to continue to pray for the leaders of Liberia and for the betterment of Liberia and the sustainability of the peace of the country. “Regardless of the circumstances the best for you as Muslims is to continue to pray because when you pray for the betterment of the country you are not only praying for the leaders, but for yourself because when the country gets better it gets better for you, especially during this month of Ramadan”. He noted. He pledged his total commitment to continue to support Islamic activities in Margibi County as far as he continues to be alive. Receiving the food items and cash, one of the Margibi County Islamic community leaders, Imam Abraham Massaley, thanked Mr. Damaro for the gesture and offered prayer to God to reward him for always remembering them. One of the Muslims from the Margibi County Islamic community, Mohammed Sayon who also thanked Sekou Kalasco Damaro for the gesture, prayed to God to bless him abundantly.",
