  "text": "You can know that you are saved Published 9:04 The truth is, God wants everyone to be saved. Peter wrote, “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance” (2 Peter 3:9 KJV). The Bible over and over again, asserts that God made it possible so that everyone could be saved. However, mankind has a real problem. His problem is sin and according to Paul in Romans 3:23, all have sinned. John agrees when he said in 1 John 1:8, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” So how can people know with assurance that they have salvation? The Word Of God assures us that salvation is real. Peter in 2 Peter 1:10 KJV, wrote “Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.” So, it is possible to know that we have salvation. Paul in 2 Timothy 1:12, said that God was able to keep that which he had committed to Him. Paul in his mind and in his writings had no doubt that God could save men. Then John said, “These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God” (1 John 5:13 KJV). These words assure the faithful Christian that regardless of when death calls, they will have salvation. However, for the unfaithful Christian there is no hope at all. We learn in Hebrews 10:26-27 KJV, “For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.” This should encourage all Christians to be careful to not fall away from God. This is what happened to some Christians in Galatia. To some of them Paul said, “Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace” (Galatians 5:4 KJV). The choice of Heaven or Hell is ours. We should note that God never sent any man to Hell. However, men will send themselves to that place prepared for Satan and his followers (Matthew 25:41). As long as we are with Christ, no one can rob us of our salvation. Can we choose to walk away from our relationship with Jesus? Absolutely! However, in John 10:27-29, Jesus shows that as long as we strive to follow Him, no force on earth can take us from God. In truth we are weak and often struggle to remain faithful to God. But the Christian does not have to be perfect. Living a perfect life is something that only Jesus could do. John helps us to understand that as long as we are “walking in the light,” that is we are not living to sin we still have fellowship with God. There are times when even the best Christians will sin in ignorance or during a period of weakness. But if the Child of God, those “walking in the light” are willing to repent of those sins, God is faithful to forgive those men. This is how a Christian remains in a saved condition. The key is that Christians are striving to walk in the light and not in the darkness of sin. As Peter expressed in 2 Peter 3:14, we must live in diligence for the Lord. We have to put forth the effort. According to Paul in Romans 4:6-8, there are those to whom God will not impute their sin; these are they who have obeyed God’s plan of salvation and strive to live for Him every day. The Christian must also have a forgiving spirit towards others (Matt. 6:14-15). To continually confess our wrongs (Psalm 19:12-13). We should always pray to God concerning our sins; we should always ask him to help us to live better each and every day; and in this way we remain in a saved condition. The Christian must pursue faithfulness. Revelation 2:10 “… Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.” Are you a Christian today? You can become a Christian by hearing God (Romans 19:17). Believing that Jesus is the Son of God (Mark 16:16). Repenting of your sins (Acts 2:38). Confessing that Jesus is the Son of God (Matt. 10:32). Being baptized into Christ (Romans 6:3-4, 1 Peter 3:21, Acts 2:38). By living a faithful life (Titus 2:12).
