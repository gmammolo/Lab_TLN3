  "text": "A series of accidents on a single street in Banya, south-west of Caloundra, has left seven people injured, including two children. The incidents unfolded on Thursday morning, with the first crash occurring around 11:45 AM. A vehicle carrying a woman and two children collided with a truck on Banya Avenue. Tragically, one child sustained critical injuries and has been airlifted to the Queensland Children’s Hospital for urgent medical attention. The condition of the second child is less severe, and they have been transported to Sunshine Coast University Hospital.\nSimultaneously, another two-vehicle collision took place at the intersection of Banya Avenue and Bruny Street, around the same timeframe. Fortunately, no life-threatening injuries were reported in this separate incident. In total, paramedics evaluated seven individuals involved in both crashes; five were subsequently taken to Sunshine Coast University Hospital for treatment.\nAuthorities have remained on-site to manage the situation, urging motorists to steer clear of Banya Avenue due to significant delays expected in the area. The police are conducting investigations into the circumstances surrounding both accidents as community members await updates on the recovery of those injured.",
