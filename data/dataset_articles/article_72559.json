  "text": "New Delhi: With the sun edging towards the horizon, Ram Dev, his navy-blue skull cap neatly adjusted, hurried his team of volunteers. Time was ticking; they had to ensure food reached the hungry before dusk. Leading Murali, Komal and a group of 26 other volunteers, including children, Ram Dev oversaw the transfer of iftar meals from a van into the Walajah Big Mosque. The food, prepared for around 1,200 people, had been cooked at their temple on Dr Radhakrishnan Road in Mylapore, ready to be served to Muslims breaking their fast during Ramzan. This tradition, spanning 40 years, originated from the initiative of Dada Ratanchand, a Hindu who sought refuge in Chennai during partition. Establishing the Sufidar Trust, a temple dedicated to propagating the teachings of Sufi saint Shahenshah Baba Nebhraj Sahib, Ratanchand fostered a philosophy of unity among religions. \"All gods are one,\" as proclaimed by their guruji, encapsulated the ethos of the trust. Donning skull caps while serving iftar meals signified respect for the sentiments of their Muslim brethren, ensuring hygiene standards were maintained, The Times of India reported. Ram Dev's devotion to selfless service Ram Dev, formerly engaged in his family's automobile business, found deeper purpose in service. Breaking away from his commercial pursuits, he devoted more time to sewa or selfless service. Volunteers from Maharashtra and Rajasthan, now settled in Chennai, joined him in the noble endeavour. Buckets brimming with fried rice, vegetable pickle, bananas, kesar milk, water, dates, nuts and biscuits were swiftly unloaded and transferred to paper plates. Volunteers served attendees gathered in the mosque courtyard, offering 'Nombu' gruel in bowls as well. This longstanding tradition of communal service forged a deep bond between the mosque and the Sufidar temple, nurtured over decades. Temple kitchen's evolution Initiated by Dada Ratanchand four decades ago, the temple kitchen underwent scrutiny for hygiene and cleanliness by members of the Arcot royal family, cementing an agreement to provide iftar meals during Ramzan. For individuals like fifty-year-old Jamila, breaking fast at the mosque held special significance, providing sustenance and solace before returning home after a day's work.",
