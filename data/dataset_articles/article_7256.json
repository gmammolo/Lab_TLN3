  "text": "SPOKANE, Wash. — Updated at 9:51 P.M. All westbound lanes of Interstate 90 near the Four Lakes interchange at milepost 270 remain blocked because of multiple collisions, according to the Washington State Department of Transportation.\nOfficials said some drivers are traveling the wrong way along the shoulder, preventing emergency vehicles and tow trucks from reaching the crash scene. The Washington State Patrol and at least two tow trucks have been delayed as a result.\nTransportation officials said vehicles stopping or driving on the shoulder are slowing efforts to clear the roadway and reopen the highway.\nDrivers are urged to avoid the area, remain in their vehicles, keep shoulders clear for emergency responders and use alternate routes while crews work to clear the collisions.\nThis person, while facing the right direction is backing up on I-90 down the shoulder.\n— WSDOT East (@WSDOT_East)\nBecause travelers are blocking the shoulder for emergency vehicles and tow trucks, it is only delaying the ability to reopen I-90 and get the trucks moved.[https://t.co/gxS3NVKuxm][pic.twitter.com/mJ5ubVK9u6][January 8, 2026]\n--\nAll westbound lanes of I-90 near the Four Lakes interchange at milepost 270 are blocked because of multiple collisions, according to the Washington State Department of Transportation.\nDrivers are urged to avoid the area and use alternate routes while crews respond and work to clear the roadway.\nHeads up to travelers that ALL westbound lanes of I-90 near the Four Lakes interchange at milepost 270 are currently blocked due to collisions.\n— WSDOT East (@WSDOT_East)\nUse alternate routes at this time.[pic.twitter.com/63Lv0P2aO8][January 8, 2026]\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 BY KXLY.
