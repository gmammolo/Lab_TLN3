  "text": "An inspiring evening of Torah and unity took place at Yeshivas Lubavitch Baltimore as the bochurim gathered for a Siyum HaRambam event. The event was graciously MC’ed by Hirshy Lerner, who eloquently introduced the proceedings and provided insightful commentary. Distinguished speakers addressed the crowd, including Rabbi Elchonon Lisbon, who completed the Rambam. Rabbi Levi Greenbaum shared words of inspiration about studying the Rambam and emphasizing the importance of how every bocher must learn three prokim. Rabbi Levi Nejar started the new Rambam cycle and offered further words of encouragement, saying how what the Rebbe tells us is like receiving a text message from Hashem. Each speaker provided unique perspectives and insights, underscoring the profound significance of studying the Rambam and the unity it fosters among the Jewish people. The event was meticulously organized by the Talmidim Hashluchim of Yeshivas Lubavitch Baltimore, ensuring that every detail was attended to with precision and care. The celebratory atmosphere was further enhanced by the music played by Lavik Halberstam.",
