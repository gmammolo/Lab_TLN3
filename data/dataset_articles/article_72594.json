  "text": "The Calgary Unitarian Church is hosting drag queens in their Easter Sunday service. At least four men dressed as women will participate in the church service – a program titled, “Drag Me to Church.” Pastors say the Easter Sunday event is meant to show solidarity with the gay community and to serve as a sacred act of protest. “No matter what tradition you’re from, I guarantee you that you will have people in your community who identify on the 2SLGBTQIA+ spectrum — whether they are free to say it or not,” Rev. Samaya Oakley [told the Edmonton Journal](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/sacred-act-of-protest-drag-show-planned-for-calgary-unitarians-easter-sunday-service#:~:text=%E2%80%9CNo%20matter%20what%20tradition%20you,minister%20of%20the%20Calgary%20Unitarians.). “If we are truly people who believe in the goodness and the inherent love that exists in this world, then we would extend that to people on that spectrum.” But there’s nothing sacred about drag queens desecrating the sanctity of the church house. This year Easter Sunday falls on the same day as International Transgender Day of Visibility. The Unitarians say they plan to pass the offering plate to raise money for a program that supports men who think they are women. The all-ages Easter service will feature drag performances, a drag queen storytime, and multiple speakers addressing the question, “What does TRANSformation mean today?” “One of our principles is the inherent worth and dignity of every person,” Oakley said. “And that’s where we come from in terms of this work.” Hersey may not be a strong enough word for what the church is doing – but as the Bible tells us – God will not be mocked.
