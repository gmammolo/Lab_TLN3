  "text": "RENEWAMERICA — Keeping in mind that \"God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil\" (\nsee Acts 10:38), let us all resolve to do our best to do as Jesus did — with the help of God's Spirit — to please God in all aspects of our lives with all our \"heart, soul, and mind,\" as Jesus commands us to do in Matthew 22:37.\nSuch sincere effort to improve our influence in our divinely-inspired, divinely-created nation is consistent with God’s emphatic warning to all of us in\n2 Chronicles 7:14 that\nIf my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.\nThese vital scriptural words are more relevant today than ever, as our culture continues to move steadily away from God’s laws and from our nation’s founding principles as a direct consequence of godless Marxists’ and Leftists’ increasingly successful “\nLong march through our nation’s institutions” over the past hundred-plus years.\nTo the extent any of us can do so, we each need to awake and arise and stand forth in courage and righteous indignation and take back our country upon the principles of the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Bible—with God’s help and the power of His Spirit, as well as with all the faith we can muster as we seek to please God in all we do, and to obey His Spirit in everything we undertake in our daily lives—just as Jesus did, as cited above in\n Acts 10:38.",
