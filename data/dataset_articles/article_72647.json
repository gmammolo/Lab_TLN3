  "text": "[View Cart](/store/cart/)\nThis is Ken Ham, inviting you to the world-class\nCreation Museum in Northern Kentucky.\nToday is Good Friday, when we remember Christ’s death. But we look forward to Sunday because that’s when we celebrate that he is alive!\nNow some people say the resurrection is just a legend that grew for decades before it was written down.\nBut the Apostle Paul wrote that Jesus appeared to over five hundred people at once and that most of these people were still alive. If the church back then didn’t believe Paul’s testimony, they could’ve asked numerous eyewitnesses. In other words, the resurrection couldn’t’ve just been a legend that developed—it would be to easy to have fact-checked it!\nWe can trust the Bible. Jesus—he’s alive!\nKen Ham is the Founder CEO of\n[Answers in Genesis–US](/), the highly acclaimed Creation Museum, and the world-renowned Ark Encounter. Ken Ham is one of the most in-demand Christian speakers in North America.\nAnswers in Genesis is an apologetics ministry, dedicated to helping Christians defend their faith and proclaim the\n[good news of Jesus Christ](/good-news/).",
