  "text": "Mar 29, 2024, 08:39 PM IST Easter 2024 falls on 31st March. It celebrates Jesus Christ's resurrection from the dead, as described in the New Testament of the Bible. It is the most important event in Christianity, symbolising the victory of life over death and the promise of salvation. Easter is celebrated worldwide with various traditions. Many people attend church services, participate in feasts, and engage in Easter egg hunts and other activities symbolising new life and rebirth. Easter eggs and the Easter Bunny are common symbols associated with the holiday, representing new life and fertility. The Easter egg hunt is a popular activity for children, while adults often exchange Easter eggs as gifts. For Christians, Easter commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, a pivotal event in Christian theology symbolising hope and redemption. Different cultures have unique ways of celebrating Easter. In some regions, there are processions, reenactments of the Passion of Christ and other religious and cultural events. Easter is a time for families and communities to come together. It is often marked by shared meals and gatherings, reinforcing bonds and traditions.",
