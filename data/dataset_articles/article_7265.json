  "text": "Next Article\nIndiGo passengers face chaos and delays at Mumbai airport\nIf you're flying IndiGo in or out of Mumbai lately, it's been rough—think slow check-ins, long lines, and barely any staff around when you need help.\nThis comes right after a December meltdown where 4,500 IndiGo flights were canceled in early December because of stricter pilot rest rules.\nWhy are people upset?\nPassengers have taken to social media to vent.\nKunal Purohit skipped the check-in line on January 7 because it was so long he thought he'd miss his flight—then got stuck with a self-bag drop facility that failed despite multiple tries and no staff in sight.\nAnanya Sharan shared that her flight had everyone waiting nearly 20 minutes for ground staff assistance to disembark the aircraft.\nWhat's IndiGo saying?\nSo far, IndiGo hasn't responded to all these complaints.\nWith so many flights canceled last month and fares on other airlines shooting up (sometimes costing more than international trips), travelers are left frustrated—and still waiting for answers.",
