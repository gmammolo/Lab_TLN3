  "text": "NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat remembered the warrior queen of the Maratha empire, Ahilyabai Holkar on her 299th birth anniversary on Friday.\"Even in today's situation, her character is ideal for us. Unfortunately, she became a widow. Despite being a single woman, she not only managed her large kingdom, but also made it bigger, and not only made the kingdom bigger, but also ran it as a good governance. She is the ideal of what kind of ruler should be like,\" the RSS chief said.Praising Ahilyabai Holkar for her contributions, Bhagwat said that she built industries so that the people could get employment and built them so strong that the textile industry of Maheshwar is still running and provides employment to many people.\"The word Punyashlok is behind her name. Punyashlok is the ruler who frees the people from all kinds of deprivations. She built industries so that the people could get employment and built them so strong that the textile industry of Maheshwar is still running and employs many people. She also cared for all the sections,\" he said.\"She made the tax system of her kingdom well-organized. She cared for the farmers. Her kingdom was good in every way. Efforts to emulate her, to remember her will go on everywhere throughout the year, it is a matter of great joy,\" the RSS chief added.MaharAhilyabai Holkar was born on May 31, 1725, in the village of Chaundi (current day Ahmednagar), Maharashtra. Today marks the 297th birth anniversary of the Queen, regarded as one of the finest female rulers in Indian history.She was known for her wisdom and administrative skills. Every year, her birth anniversary is celebrated on May 31st. As a prominent ruler of the Malwa kingdom, Ahilyabai Holkar spread the message of 'dharma', promoted industrialization, and built many Hindu temples and Dharamshalas across India.Her father, Mankoji Sindhia (Shinde), a scion of the Dhangar family, was the Patil of the Village. At a time when women were not allowed to go to school, Ahilyabai Holkar's father taught her to read and write.On his way to Pune, Malhar Rao Holkar, a commander of Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao in the Malwa territory, spotted an eight-year-old Ahilyabai at a temple service feeding the hungry and poor. Impressed by her, he married his son Khanderao to her in 1733.In 1748, she broke societal norms by marrying her daughter to Yashwantrao - a poor but brave man.Ahilyabai ruled for nearly three decades and was given the title of 'The Philosopher Queen' by British historian John Keyas.The warrior queen passed away on August 13, 1795, at the age of 70 in Rameswaram.",
