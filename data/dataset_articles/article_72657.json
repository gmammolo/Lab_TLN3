  "text": "For most, Nathdwara, located in the picturesque Aravalli Hills in Rajasthan, is synonymous with the famous Shrinathji Temple, with the city’s name itself translating to ‘The Gateway of the Lord'. The temple, dedicated to Shrinathji (an incarnation of Lord Krishna) is the epicentre of all religious fervour in the city. But it is not just Lord Krishna whose faith rules here. The city is now also famous for being home to the tallest statue dedicated to Lord Shiva. Statue of Belief/Vishwas Swaroopam The world's tallest statue of Lord Shiva, the imposing \\\"Statue of Belief,\\\" or Vishwas Swaroopam, stands at a staggering 369 feet on the Ganesh Tekri hillock, dwarfing all other Shiva statues globally. Envisioned by Madan Paliwal, Chairman of Udaipur’s Miraj Group, and inaugurated in October 2022, this statue itself is 339 feet tall, with an additional 30 feet for the pedestal. It took 750 skilled workers 10 years to complete this structure, with the foundation stone laid in 2012. This colossal structure serves multiple purposes. Inside, visitors can explore an exhibition hall and marvel at the scenic beauty through viewing galleries accessible by elevator. You can also see a 25-foot-tall statue of Nandi, Shiva's sacred bull. And much like other destinations, there is a 3D projection mapping show that starts at 8pm daily and lasts about 25 minutes. The area surrounding the statue also has a water body, bridge, landscaping, an amphitheatre, food court, handicraft shops, and an amusement park for children. But the most impressive experience at this destination is the ‘Jalabhishek’. You can stand at the structure created at the top of the statue and pour water on Lord Shiva from a staggering height of 351ft.Also Read: Visit These Powerful Shiva Temples In IndiaTickets for Statue of BeliefThe standard entry to the park is INR 200. If you want to go to the glass bridge, the cost is INR 400 and if you’d like to experience doing the statue’s Jalabhishek, the ticket will cost you INR 1500.",
