  "text": "A delegation of Buddhist leaders called on Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad. The delegation is visiting Pakistan to attend a symposium and an exhibition titled ‘From Gandhara to the World,’ organised by Pakistan’s Foreign Affairs Ministry. The delegation included Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Minister, Vidura Wikramanayake, Most Ven. Thich Duc Tuan Thera from Vietnam, Most Ven. Anil Sakya Thera from Thailand and Dr. Keshabman Shakya from Nepal. He expressed his gratitude for their participation in the symposium, being held in connection with the ‘Vesak Day’ that commemorates the birth, enlightenment and passing away of the Buddha. The Prime Minister highlighted that Pakistan was proud of its ancient Buddhist heritage, which flourished in the Northwest Pakistan in the shape of Gandhara art and culture, over two thousand years ago. He underscored the importance that his Government attached to interfaith harmony. He also acknowledged the valuable contributions of the Buddhist scholars and monks to the promotion of interfaith harmony and understanding.\nThe Buddhist leaders appreciated the Prime Minister’s commitment to fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect for all religions. They also commended Pakistan’s efforts to preserve and promote its Buddhist heritage sites and cultural artifacts. The delegation members showed their keen desire to collaborate with Pakistan in preserving and promoting Buddhist heritage in that country.\nThe Prime Minister and the delegation discussed ways to strengthen interfaith dialogue and cooperation, as well as opportunities for cultural and academic exchanges between Pakistan and the Buddhist majority countries. The meeting concluded with a resolve to continue exploring avenues for mutual understanding and cooperation, and to work together towards a more harmonious and peaceful world. The possibility of establishing a joint forum for dialogue and collaboration was also discussed.\nPakistan’s Religious Affairs Minister Salik Hussain, Information and Broadcasting and Cultural Heritage Minister Ataullah Tarar, SAPM Syed Tariq Fatemi also attended.",
