  "text": "by Saheed Salawu May 31, 2024 in Eye of Islam Reading Time: 1 min read A A A A Reset Abiodun\nTHE Ogun State Muslim Council (OMC) has commended the state governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun for providing fund to augment the shortfall in the Basic Travel Allowance (BTA) for the state’s pilgrims for this year’s hajj.\nThe council, in a statement signed by the Secretary-General, Alhaji Kamaldeen Akintunde, described the governor’s gesture as one that would ease the affairs of the pilgrims in the holy land and enhance the smooth performance of the hajj rites.\nIt recalled that Governor Abiodun saved the pilgrims from the agonies of the shortfall in their Basic Travel Allowance (BTA) arising from the vagaries of the foreign exchange rates.\nRelated Posts APC chieftain says Abiodun’s commitment to Ogun residents unparalleled Sanwo-olu, Abiodun, others grace Pa Obasa’s 8th days fidau prayers Over 8,000 Ogun farmers receive support to boost food production According to the OMC, while NAHCON used N1,252.01 per dollar to calculate hajj fare (BTA inclusive) to give $500 as BTA to each pilgrim, the CBN released BTA at N1,530.86 per dollar, which gives each pilgrim $415 instead of $500.\nIt said for each pilgrim to get $500 at the new exchange rate of N1,530.86 per dollar, the differential to be paid for the state’s 934 pilgrims was N119,560,712.70, which Governor Abiodun paid in order to ensure that the pilgrims perform their hajj rites without stress.\nWith this gesture, the OMC said Governor Abiodun had exhibited the Islamic principles of tolerance, compassion and kind heartedness.\nThe Muslim body implored the governor to sustain what it described as his kind service to the people to enhance the realisation of the ‘Building Our Future Together’ agenda of his government.\nThe council implored the pilgrims to reciprocate the gesture by abiding by Saudi Arabia laws and avoid any act that could tarnish their names or damage Nigeria’s image.\nRead Also: Tinubu assures intelligence community of conducive working environment\nGet real-time news updates from Tribune Online!
