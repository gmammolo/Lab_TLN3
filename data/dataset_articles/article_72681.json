  "text": "The Vivekananda Rock Memorial, a serene retreat imbued with spiritual significance, stands majestically in the southern part of India. This iconic site, where Swami Vivekananda envisioned Ek Bharat, Shresht Bharat, recently hosted Prime Minister Narendra Modi following his hectic campaign schedule. Upon his arrival in Kanyakumari, the Prime Minister's first stop was the revered Bhagavathi Amman temple. Clad in traditional attire, he engaged in prayers, circumambulated the sanctum, performed aarti, and received prasad, embodying the deep spiritual connection of the visit. Later, at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial, PM Modi commenced a 45-hour meditation session at 6:45 PM on Thursday. During this period of silence, he will sustain himself solely on coconut water, grape juice, and other liquids. This meditative retreat not only offers the Prime Minister a respite from his demanding duties but also underscores the Memorial’s enduring symbolism of national unity and the vision for a developed India. The Rock Memorial, with its tranquil beauty and historical significance, continues to inspire and invoke a sense of profound reflection and patriotism.",
