  "text": "YEREVAN, 31 MAY, ARMENPRESS. On June 1, to mark the International Day for Protection of Children, AraratBank is implementing another program within its social responsibility framework. The Bank will donate children's prayer books to beneficiary children of the City of Smile Foundation.\nAraratBank has been cooperating with the City of Smile Charitable Foundation for years already, joining the Foundation in its efforts to treat children with cancer.\nThe prayer book is intended for children around 5 to 8 years old. From the child’s earliest years, the cognitive attribute of the relationship between the parent and the child is quite strong, and the child asks his mother plenty of questions, and it is the mother who acquaints the child with the world, provides answers and teaches him to pray in simple words.\n\"The idea of ​​ creating a prayer book for kids came up in conversations with my son. In 2020, he broke his leg, and even the strongest painkillers didn’t give him relief from the severe pain after the surgery. My son asked me to pray for him, and I started to pray, and the faith was so great that the pain was gone. One day, when I suggested that he should pray himself, I realized that my child didn’t know how to pray for his needs. This is how the idea of ​​ creating a children's prayer book was born. The book can become the first guide for children, the first prayer book that will teach them how to pray and, at the same time, to start a conversation with God. And since the conversation took place between my son and me, the book is narrated as a \"Conversation between a mother and her child,\" shares her experience Marianna Apresyan, Doctor of Theology, founder and president of Christian Women's Forum NGO.\n\"With this initiative, the Bank, under the Foundation’s auspices, stands by children fighting cancer and malignant blood disorders, promoting unity and hope. As a matter of fact, an intellectual team of eight employees, recently formed at AraratBank, participated in the \"What? Where? When?” charity championship a few days ago and directed the funds raised at the event to the treatment of children with cancer. This once again emphasizes the importance of the Bank’s commitment to social responsibility,\" notes Anna Allahverdyan, Advisor on Public Relations to CEO of AraratBank.",
