  "text": "[Faith & Spirituality](https://www.islamicity.org/explore/topics/faith/), [Featured](https://www.islamicity.org/explore/featured/), [Highlights](https://www.islamicity.org/explore/highlights/)Topics: [Quran](https://www.islamicity.org/topics/quran/) 160 The birth of a child stands as one of life's most extraordinary moments for a woman. It is an event mixed with courage, joy, and immense mental, physical, and emotional strength. However, despite the excitement that the birth of a child brings, underneath that surface, many women experience significant vulnerabilities, obstacles, and trauma - yet this remains a testament to the profound strength of women. Each breath a mother takes during labor is often with pain, but this is no doubt yet another beautiful miracle of Allah (SWT) that women bring us into this world. Our Creator says in Surah Luqman, Ayah 14, 'And We have commanded people to honor their parents. Their mothers bore them through hardship upon hardship, and their weaning takes two years. So be grateful to Me and your parents. To Me is the final return' ( [31:14](https://www.islamicity.org/quransearch/index.php?q=31%3A14)). This narrative deepens when we consider the significant interventions that bridge the gap in health disparities, as researched in a recent [case study](http://ijmhs.id/index.php/OK/article/view/50) for the International Journal of Midwifery and Health Sciences. This study showcases the unique connection that exists between spirituality and medical care, proving how the recitation of the Quran during the first stages of labor can significantly alleviate pain for birthing mothers. It is a reminder of the often overlooked benefits of the Quran, revered and frequently read during Ramadhan but not as commonly turned to throughout the rest of the year. The study highlights the spiritual peace it provides and its benefits in one of life's most challenging moments. The case study further highlights the importance of having a more holistic approach to labor/childbirth. In a 2024 [case study,](http://ijmhs.id/index.php/OK/article/view/50) The Effect of Murrotal Al-Qur'an Audio on First Stage Labor Pain Among Maternity Women, three researchers conducted a study on women 'who were in the first stage labor in January 2022 which consisted of 68 women'. The women were admitted to Prof. Dr. J. A. Latumeten Hospital in Maluku Province, Indonesia. The 68 women who were selected for this experiment had no hearing complications or labor difficulties. For the experimental group, an audio recitation of Surah Ar-Rahman was played for 30 minutes. Researchers discovered afterward that 60% of women experienced 'moderate' pain levels before the recitation, and 66.6% of women experienced only mild pain after the recitation. During the first stage of labor, the mother begins to feel multiple contractions, which gradually become more frequent and powerful, [according to the Mayo Clinic.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/labor-and-delivery/in-depth/stages-of-labor/art-20046545#:~:text=During%20active%20labor%2C%20your%20cervix,increasing%20pressure%20in%20your%20back.) Because it is the lengthiest labor phase, doctors have divided it into early and active labor. The length of stage one varies from woman to woman, with some labor pains only lasting a few hours. For others, it can last a couple of days. According to the research, 'childbirth pain (is) ranked among the most intense pains recorded compared with other sources of acute pain (such as a fracture or deep laceration)'. The pain of childbirth can be so intense that it affects a woman psychologically, impacting the entire birth process and the welfare of the baby. Several factors determine how intense labor pains can be, and those are 'age, anxiety, fear of childbirth, education, individual perception of pain, and the role of the midwife'. Labor also drastically changes the human body, causing chronic pain, postpartum depression, and changes in heart rate/blood pressure. Many medical professionals either use pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies to manage labor pain. Non-pharmacological pain therapies include 'acupressure, acupuncture, cold compresses, warm compresses, hydrotherapy, hypnotherapy', and even Quran recitations. The purpose of these therapies is to completely distract the mother from the pain. Unfortunately, many women who experience severe labor pains are not provided with these resources. According to a study, The Effect of Qur'anic murrotal Therapy on Postpartum Blues During the Puerperium, 'murrotal is the chanting of the holy verses of the Quran'. These verses are recited in a steady rhythm at a 'slow and harmonious tempo'. When listening to the verses of the Quran, this therapy reduces 'stress hormones, [activates] natural endorphins, [increases] feelings of relaxation, and [distracts] from fear, anxiety, and tension'. Although the exact origin or inventor of murrotal therapy is not well-documented, it is recognized as a complementary therapy that utilizes the spiritual and soothing qualities of Quranic recitations to support physical and mental well-being. Studies have shown that murrotal therapy can effectively reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients and improve psychological states. For instance, research conducted at Universitas Muhammadiyah Semarang demonstrated its efficacy in lowering blood pressure among hypertensive patients. Another study highlighted its positive impact on cardiovascular reactivity in hypertensive pre-elderly subjects. The practice itself represents a significant collective development in the field of spiritual and holistic health care, particularly within Muslim communities. When listening to the Quran and the way it calms down the body, there is a direct link between the mind and the heart. Research states 'impulses (stimuli) enter the brain through the auditory area'. The cochlea sends these signals to the thalamus, which then transfers them to the amygdala, the brains control center for emotions. From the amygdala, the signals are relayed to the hippocampus, and then to the hypothalamus. Once the audio is processed, it generates an energy that positively impacts the heart. Allah (SWT) says in the Quran, 'We send down the Quran as a healing and mercy for the believers, but it only increases the wrongdoers in loss (The Clear Quran®, 17:82)'. Not only is murrotal therapy something that can greatly benefit women during childbirth, but it is a great resource to have for those who are suffering from postpartum depression. There is no doubt that modern technology has made the practice of listening to the Quran on the go a lot more accessible.
