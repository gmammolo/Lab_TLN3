  "text": "Surrounded by the towering Vindhya and Satpura ranges, Amarkantak, also called \\\"Teerthraj\\\" (the king of pilgrimages) is one of India’s most offbeat religious destinations. While this town in Anuppur district is famous because it is the origin city for one of India’s holiest rivers, Narmada, Amarkantak also holds great ecological significance and is a part of the a major biosphere reserve Achanakmar-Amarkantak.Along with Narmada, Amarkantak is also the origin of River Son, and Johila. Althoughthe precise origin location of River Son is actually in the Chhattisgarh village of Kodawahi butit is commonly believed that the river Son begins in Amarkantak and meets Arpa, which thenunites with Shivnath before merging again to become Mahanadi. What To See In AmarkantakThis hill town is also home to a large number of temples and shrines, many of which are protected by the Archaeological Survey of India in one compound. This complex houses several notable structures, including the Narmada Udgam Temple, where a kund is believed to be the source of the Narmada River, and the grand Karna Temple, the largest in the group. History buffs will be drawn to the Johila Temple, considered the oldest structure in the complex. You should also spend a day exploring the mysterious Yantra Temple whose construction started in 1991 but is still incomplete.Amarkantak isn't just about religious sites. Adventurers can explore the natural wonders of the region. Kapil Dhara, a waterfall named after the sage Kapil Muni who is believed to have meditated here, is the first waterfall of River Narmada, which plunges 24 metres here. There is another waterfall, called Dugdh Dhara for its frothy milk-like appearance, which can be visited by travellers seeking a more offbeat experience.
