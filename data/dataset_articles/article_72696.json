  "text": "Kanniyakumari: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as part of his meditation exercise, performed 'Surya Arghya' during sunrise on Friday at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial. This ritual, integral to spiritual practice, involves offering salutations to the sun, symbolising the Almighty. Modi, with folded hands, offered prayers and performed the ritual with a traditional, small beaker-like vessel, pouring water into the sea as an offering (Arghya). He used prayer beads (Japa mala) during this spiritual exercise. 110588592A short video clip titled 'Sunrise, Surya Arghya, Spirituality,' posted by the BJP on its 'X' handle, captured the Prime Minister in this serene moment. The video shows Modi, dressed in a saffron shirt, shawl, and dhoti, pouring water into the sea and praying with his japa mala. The BJP also shared photographs of the Prime Minister meditating at the Dhyan Mandapam. In these images, Modi is seen surrounded by slowly burning incense sticks, enhancing the spiritual atmosphere. He is also seen walking around the mandapam with his prayer beads. 110588610 The photographs and video clips, appearing to be taken at different times, capture Modi deeply engrossed in meditation and spirituality. However, the release of these visuals prompted a reaction from Tamil Nadu Congress president K Selvaperunthagai, who, in a post on 'X', taunted Modi for the multiple angles and videographers involved in capturing his meditation. How many angles! How many videographers! Swami Vivekananda is silent, the Congress leader remarked. 110588622Kanyakumari, renowned for its stunning sunrises and sunsets, houses the Vivekananda Rock Memorial on a tiny islet near the shoreline. Prime Minister Modi began his meditation at this iconic location on the evening of May 30, with plans to complete it on the evening of June 1.",
