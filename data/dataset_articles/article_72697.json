  "text": "A brit milah-Jewish circumcision ceremony was held on Thursday for the third son of Rabbi Naaran Eshchar, who was killed six months ago in northern Israel. Naaran's father, Ofer Eshchar, recited the blessings and named his grandson Shahar Shimon. The event was organized by the Gvura Forum, which unites bereaved families advocating for continued fighting until Hamas is defeated. About a thousand people gathered to support the family. Gvura set up a protest tent outside the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over four weeks ago. The Eshchar family, members of the Gvura Forum, chose this location for as part of the forum's call for the government to persist in the war until victory is achieved. Master Sergeant Naaran Eshchar, 33, was a tank commander in the Armored Corps. He succumbed to his injuries on November 5, after being critically wounded when his tank overturned on the northern border. Another soldier, Sergeant First Class (res.) Yinon Fleishman, 31, was also killed in the incident. About four months before his death, Rabbi Eshchar donated a kidney to a stranger. Despite being exempt from reserve duty due to the operation, he insisted on continuing to serve and participate in the war. After his death, his family donated his organs, including his second kidney, heart, lungs, and liver.",
