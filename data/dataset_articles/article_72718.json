Human DNA is a Heavenly High-Science, in combination with S-C-G History, Christians can now possess a second version of the History of The World from another original Clan of The Earth, one that matches the Hebrew/Mosaic Pentateuch while also proving that Jesus Christ came to save every Man and Woman from every Clan and Race. All of this while demonstrating Jehovah Girah provided for; the growth, protection, and renewal of the World-wide Church that follows Jesus Christ.\n“A clear explanation of The Great Lie, its origins, beginning with The Great Flood, Nimrod and Babylon, along with how its false priests now operate unimpeded within the World’s Higher Eds. This Book will stir your heart and open your eyes, with its straight-forward explanation of Human DNA and History.”\nPublished by Christian Faith Publishing, Robert Bruce MacColla MacNiall MacIntyre’s new book is a testament to his unwavering commitment to truth and his dedication to sharing the transformative power of faith.
