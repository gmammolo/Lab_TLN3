Buddy was her true buddy, helping his person with all her chores. Buddy especially liked the early-morning Bible study, which inspired this book.\nHis Person shares, “Buddy is lost.

Follow Buddy as he learns to trust and discover that there is someone who will love him just the way he is, someone who may offer him that forever home he needs.”\nPublished by Christian Faith Publishing, His Person’s new book is sure to resonate with readers of all ages. It celebrates the joy of companionship and the transformative power of love, making it a perfect addition to any family's bookshelf. A Discussion Guide relates Buddy’s story to the promises of God, with Biblical references.\nConsumers can purchase “BUDDY AND THE BIBLE: The Forever Home” at traditional brick & mortar bookstores, or online at Amazon.com, Apple iTunes store, or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or inquiries about “BUDDY AND THE BIBLE: The Forever Home,” contact the Christian Faith Publishing media department at 866-554-0919.",
