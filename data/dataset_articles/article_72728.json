  "text": "Star, NC, May 31, 2024 --( PR.com )-- “The Posture of Submission: Her Guide to a Life of Surrender,” a profound exploration of surrendering to God's will and experiencing the transformative power of Christ's love, is the creation of published author, Melissa Cade Sikes.\nSikes shares, “You may be single, separated, divorced, or widowed and think this topic has nothing to do with you. Think again. No matter your marital status, everyone is called to a life of submission. So ready yourself as you accept the twenty-one-day challenge to live a life of submission to God and experience the transforming power of Christ in your life.\n“Humility is the first step to submission. When our motives of impure ambitions and pride are the driving force, we can’t see others above ourselves. But when we put the needs of others above our own, the goal of humility can easily be accomplished.”\nMelissa Sikes is a former award-winning newspaper journalist, teacher, and coach. She lives in North Carolina with her husband James and her two stepchildren.\nPublished by Christian Faith Publishing, Melissa Cade Sikes’s new book provides readers with practical guidance and spiritual insights to navigate the journey of surrendering to God's will and experiencing His transformative power in their lives.\nConsumers can purchase “The Posture of Submission: Her Guide to a Life of Surrender” at traditional brick & mortar bookstores, or online at Amazon.com, Apple iTunes store, or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or inquiries about “The Posture of Submission: Her Guide to a Life of Surrender,” contact the Christian Faith Publishing media department at 866-554-0919.",
