  "text": "New York, NY, May 31, 2024 --( PR.com )-- Andrew Ritchie, who was born in Buckie, Scotland, has completed his new book, “Words of Hope”: an emotional, faith-based work written to inspire hope in readers.\nAuthor Andrew Ritchie began writing in 2012, and this is his second published book. He has a BA (Hons) in theology. In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, during lockdown, he would go for his authorized walks. During that time, he would talk to people from a safe distance, and they would share their fears and hopes. Three years later, the pandemic is over, but the fear is very noticeable due to the cost-of-living crisis.\nRitchie writes, “Over the last several days, we have been looking at the seven churches of Revelation but through a different interpretation. We have been exploring them as they are human conditions of the heart. The final one is the faithful heart. Could this be the heart that is described in 1 Samuel 13:14 when the kingdom was removed from Saul? King David is often described as the man after God’s own heart.”\nPublished by Page Publishing, Andrew Ritchie’s remarkable work is rooted in the true meaning of scripture.\nReaders who wish to experience this meaningful work can purchase “Words of Hope” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes Store, Amazon, Google Play, or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing:\nPage Publishing is a traditional, full-service publishing house that handles all the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
