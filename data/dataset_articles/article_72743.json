  "text": "Minutes after touching down in the Kingdom of Tonga last week, Elder Jeremy R. Jaggi was heading to an important visit. He wanted to meet Reverend Simote Vea, a senior Free Wesleyan Church leader. Elder Jaggi is a General Authority Seventy and a member of the Pacific Area Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He and his wife, Sister Amy Jaggi, have been living in the South Pacific since August last year. This was Elder Jaggi’s first visit to Tonga. The two leaders sat down together, and for an hour, they got to know each other, their families, and their respective ministries. Despite being leaders of different denominations, they focused their discussion on their shared love for and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and in their desires to help the people of the Kingdom of Tonga to receive the blessings of God which He has in store for those who faithfully follow His Son, Jesus Christ. It was a remarkable meeting. Reverend Vea shared some of the challenges of youth and young adults, including young married couples who become separated due to the husband going overseas for work. These separations, which can be for several months to a few years, often lead to many problems for the couple. Reverend Vea also discussed some of the challenges of youth, such as drugs, crime, and unhealthy use of technology. Both Reverend Vea and Elder Jaggi agreed that turning to Jesus Christ and working together are the answers to all of society’s most difficult problems. “Education is the key,” Reverend Vea said. “Educating our youth with awareness of the harm that drugs cause is what we need to do. We need to give youth the opportunity to gain an education. As we combine our efforts, this will be effective and powerful.” Elder Jaggi agreed, adding that educating our young people with respect to using the Internet and technology in positive ways is the responsibility of all adults, including parents and faith leaders. “When we work together, united in our common goals to strengthen the rising generation, our young people listen, learn and progress,\" Elder Jaggi said. Reverend Vea shared a story from his home island of Felemea, Ha’apai. At certain times of the year the people know when they can cast their fishing nets out to sea and catch the most fish. Sometimes, they catch so many fish that it requires all the villagers’ efforts because everyone is needed to pull the fishing nets in, and the fish will be shared with everyone. Elder Jaggi said this is what is needed as we seek to help the young people of Tonga. “If we pull together, we can bring more of the youth in and help them become rooted in the Saviour Jesus Christ, so they can make better decisions as they get older.” “A rising tide floats all boats. We all do better together,” Elder Jaggi said. “Our doctrine may not be same, but we have a common goal to draw our youth closer to God.” Elder Jaggi extended his congratulations to Reverend Vea on the upcoming celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Free Wesleyan Church Conference in June. After this meeting, Elder Jaggi was interviewed on Tongan radio.
