  "text": "The spouse of Iran’s late President Ebrahim Raeisi has underlined the need for the presentation of \"true\" Islam instead of the fake version promoted by the US media empire. Jamileh Alamolhoda, an associate professor at Tehran’s Shahid Beheshti University, made the remarks on Friday during a meeting with a Jewish rabbi on the sidelines of a ceremony to commemorate President Raeisi. “The American Islam, projected by the media empire, is not real and that is why some people do not like Islam,” she said. “However, Raeisi introduced new angles of Islam in his words and deeds,” she added. Alamolhoda asked the Jewish rabbi to convey the true message of Islam to the world. She also said Western sanctions on Iran have prevented the country from relaying its message of peace to the world. \"Our country is under sanctions and the biggest sanction is the one on the media where messages are not transmitted correctly and the people of the world do not know what gems are here in Iran. The people of the world are unaware of the science, culture, beliefs and human relations produced in Iran,\" she said. Raeisi [lost his life](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2024/05/20/725894/Iran-president-ebrahim-Raeisi-Amir-Abdollahian-helicopter-crash-) alongside his accompanying delegation on May 19, when a helicopter carrying them crashed into a mountainous area in northwest Iran amid foggy conditions.
