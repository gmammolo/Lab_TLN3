  "text": "Hebrews 11: 13 (ESV)\n\"These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.\"\nFor most of the country, Memorial Day weekend is more than a long weekend without work. It is not just about backyard barbecues with family and friends—it is a weekend of remembrance. All those things are good and important, bringing joy, fellowship, and the celebration of freedom; however, it is most important to remember that lives were lost for those freedoms.\nOur men and women who have served in the United States armed forces have sacrificed everything for this country's freedom. Throughout the decades, hundreds of thousands have died in faith, believing in the freedoms we enjoy and experience. We are the most blessed country in the world, and God has raised up men and women to serve and protect us and our freedoms.\nIt is very important that we remember the men, women, fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters who have given their lives for this country. Let us not just remember but pray for and support the families of those who have lost loved ones in the service of our country. These are our family members, our friends, our next-door neighbors, and our brothers and sisters in Christ.\nChrist’s Corner honors you and thanks you for your faithful service!\nGod Bless!\nTony and Anna Green",
