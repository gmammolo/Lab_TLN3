  "text": "Ifayemi Elebuibon, an Ifa priest, believes that having public officials sworn in through traditional deities will significantly reduce corruption in the country.\nWhile addressing the press in Osogbo on Thursday, Elebuibon emphasized that politicians, when administered oaths with deities like “Ogun” (the god of iron) and other traditional methods, would be deterred from engaging in corrupt practices.\nHe pointed out that politicians are often wary of the repercussions of breaking promises when sworn in with Ogun or other traditional means.\nAccording to Elebuibon, the god of iron promptly delivers judgment upon anyone who fails to honor their commitments.\nAs the Araba of Osogbo, he expressed concern about the alarming level of corruption in the country, affecting various sectors of the economy and the general populace.\nElebuibon argued that the leniency of the Bible and the Qur’an, used in oath-taking by politicians, contributes to their misconduct.\nHe highlighted that unlike seeking forgiveness for sins committed, traditional deities such as the god of iron provide instant judgment, deterring individuals from wrongdoing.\nAdvocating for traditional oath-taking among politicians, the Ifa priest proposed that they should experience the consequences as a means to combat corruption.\nIn discussing the appointment of traditional rulers, Elebuibon, a distinguished advocate for culture, criticized the involvement of governors in the selection process.\nHe stressed that the selection of traditional rulers should be solely conducted by kingmakers, stating that governors’ interference undermines the tradition.\nWhile acknowledging the government’s role in supporting traditional rulers financially, Elebuibon urged for non-interference in their selection processes to uphold the sanctity of the traditional institution.",
