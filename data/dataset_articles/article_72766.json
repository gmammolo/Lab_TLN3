  "text": "Hajj 2024: First 400 intending pilgrims airlifted from Niger to Mecca The Niger State Government has commenced the airlift of intending pilgrims from the Bola Ahmed Tinubu International Airport, Minna, for the 2024 pilgrimage to Mecca. Over 400 intending pilgrims in the first batch, including state officials, have been airlifted from the airport. A total of 3,223 intending pilgrims are expected to be airlifted for the exercise, with eight flights scheduled from Niger State. The state governor, Mohammed Umaru Bago, while addressing them before departure, prayed fervently for the state in particular and the country in general for peace and prosperity. He advised them to be good ambassadors of the state and the country while in the holy land, saying the state government had already paid 200 dollars per pilgrim for ram slaughtering (Hidiya). The governor also urged the intending pilgrims to desist from spending extravagantly while encouraging them to channel any challenge they might encounter to the State Amirul Hajj or the chairman of the Hajj Commission for appropriate action. In his remarks, the State Amirul Hajj and Emir of Kagara, Alh. Ahmed Attahiru Gunna II appreciated the governor for his tireless efforts to ensure the safe airlifting of intending pilgrims. Also, Salamau Farouk and Mallam Muhammad Muhammad, who are part of the intending pilgrims to be airlifted in the first batch, thanked the governor for all his support and promised to be of good conduct.
