  "text": "What Is A Lightworker?A lightworker is someone here on Earth to help bring light into the world, transforming darkness. It's not as daunting as it sounds. Every time you turn a fearful thought into something positive, it helps not only you but everyone around you. By bringing more light into yourself, you help others do the same. You are meant to shine brightly, and nothing should dim your inner light. Lightworkers come in all forms, from nurses and mothers to artists and managers. They are found everywhere, across the globe, in all ages and cultures. You're already equipped to fulfill your purpose; you've been preparing for this for ages.Traits That Say You Are A LightworkerYou Feel Like You Are Wasting TimeOne interesting trait of a lightworker is feeling like you are wasting time, which often leads to anxiety or sadness. You have likely felt this since childhood, but could not figure out what to do about it. This feeling pushes you to do something great and it is a reminder that you are here for a bigger purpose. It keeps you from settling and encourages you to take action in life.You Feel Your Life Purpose Even When You Don’t Know What It IsYou feel drawn to a greater destiny and have spent a lot of time figuring out your life purpose. You might have read many books or articles on this topic and have thought about it since childhood. The universe wants you to awaken to your purpose so you can act on it consciously. When you know your life mission, you can achieve more by tapping into your unlimited potential. Your only limit is how much you let yourself shine.You Feel Like Saving The WorldEvery lightworker believes they are here to make the world better. They are tired of seeing suffering and want to help change it. They may feel a big responsibility to save their loved ones and even the whole planet. But it is a huge task. Some of this feeling comes from the ego, and some from recognizing that when all lightworkers unite, they can truly make a difference.You Are A Powerful ManifestorLooking back at your life, you may see that you have achieved what you wanted, at least to some extent, without extra effort or following specific rules. This is because you have a lot of energy that quickly turns into results. But be careful as you are more powerful than you realize. You need to be responsible for how you use your energy. If it's not aligned, you might unintentionally cause problems for yourself or others.You Are An EmpathNot all empaths are lightworkers, but every lightworker is an empath. An empath feels the emotions of others, whether it's sadness or happiness. Before realizing they're empaths, they might think those feelings are their own. But actually, they have picked up on someone else's energy.Belief In A Higher PowerNo matter how tough life gets, you have always felt connected to a higher power, whether it is God, the universe, or something else. As a lightworker, you believe in something bigger than yourself. You might feel this higher power guiding you. Even if your prayers do not always get answered, you know there is a greater purpose to life than just living and dying. You have never doubted that there is something beyond what we can understand, and you feel like you are a part of it.",
