  "text": "In Hindu religion, there are 7 people who were given the boon of immortality. Immortals, or Chiranjeevis, were blessed or punished with eternal life by different Gods according to their acts. It is said that these Chiranjeevis still roam on Earth and live among people but not everyone can see them. Here we list the 7 immortals and where they are believed to be now. . Lord Hanuman, Shri Ram’s biggest devotee was given the boon of immortality before Lord Ram went back to his abode. According to various beliefs, Hanuman ji can be found where the name of Lord Ram is being chanted. But, according to scriptures, it is also said that Lord Hanuman lives in the Gandhamadan mountains, meditating on the name of Lord Ram and ready to help any of his devotees who need him.Some people also say that he roams the forests and mountains, like the Himalayas and Kishkindha. Ashwathama, the son of Dronacharya, was the one who unleashed the Brahmastra during the Mahabharat and was cursed with immortality and suffering by Lord Krishna. As per the curse, he is forced to wander the Earth until the end of Kalyug and he shall till that time bear the pain of his wounds and the burden of his actions during the war. Many legends and tales say that Ashwathama roams the forests and desolate places, especially around the Narmada river. King Mahabali is also considered to be an immortal of Hinduism and was given the boon of visiting his people once a year, during the festival of Onam. According to beliefs and scriptures, Mahabali was pushed to Patala and now lives there, but he comes up to Earth during the festival to bless his people. . Veda Vyasa, the sage who wrote and brought together the Vedas and authored the Mahabharata, is believed to live in seclusion somewhere in the Himalayas. It is believed that Ved Vyasa lives in the Badra region, way ahead of Badrinath, in a place that cannot be reached by humans.People believe that he still comes to places where Mahabharata paath is going on and his presence can be felt in spiritual activities. . Vibhishana, the brother of Ravana, who went against him to join Lord Ram’s army and side with Dharma was also given the boon of immortality. Many believe that Vibhishana is also a Chiranjeevi and was given the reins of Lanka after Ravana's defeat. Kripacharya, one of the great teachers and warriors in the Mahabharata, was given the boon of immortality for his dedication to the study and teaching of the Vedas. It is said that Kripacharya became the only person who stayed true to his ideals and did not use any ‘Divyastras’. He always obeyed the rules of war and remained steadfast and impartial. It is said that he will live till the end of Kalyug, but will never be known to the human eye and will forever live in desolation. . Parashuram, the warrior-sage, was the one responsible for ridding the world of corrupt Kshatriya rulers. Once he completed his task, Parashuram retired to a life of penance and teaching. It is widely believed that he resides in the Mahendragiri mountains and in other remote hermitages, changing his places constantly. . \" } Back to Top",
