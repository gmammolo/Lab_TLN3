  "text": "A common theme in the sacred literature of the world is that we are spiritual beings. Our material existence has a deeper meaning and purpose which extends beyond our earthly lives. We are here to grow spiritually.\nYet, how does one grow spiritually? For one, the soul develops by applying divine qualities to our lives — that is, by practicing virtues in every situation we find ourselves in. Practicing virtues, such as kindness, forgiveness, faithfulness and patience, enables us to make a positive difference in this world and to grow spiritually.\nAccording to the Baha’i Writings, a comparison can be made between the physical development of a baby in the womb and our spiritual development in this world. In the womb, the baby is preparing to be born into this world: It is growing eyes, ears, arms, legs and internal organs that will be needed in this life.\nPeople are also reading…\nNot until the baby “dies” to the dark and narrow confines of the womb and is born into this vast new world, is the usefulness of its physical development in the womb understood. In the womb the baby develops eyes, for example, without understanding how they will be used here.\nAccording to this analogy, the world is like the womb of our souls. In this world we are growing in spiritual ways, developing qualities that are needed in the world to come. Virtues, we are told, are an important aspect of the soul’s development.\nThe Baha’i Writings summarize the comparison in this way: “Just as he acquired the powers necessary for this world in the world of the womb, so, likewise, he must obtain that which he will need in the world of the Kingdom — that is to say, all the heavenly powers — in this world.”\nFortunately, by practicing the virtues, referred to in the Bible as the “fruits of the spirit,” we are happier, our conscience is clear and our lives become more fulfilling. And, according to the analogy of the womb, when we die to this world, we are born into an even more vast and wonderful world beyond.\nHistory photos: Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Bloomington\n1935: Holy Trinity Catholic Church\n1938: Holy Trinity Catholic Church\n1953: Holy Trinity Catholic Church\n1953: Holy Trinity Catholic Church\n1953: Holy Trinity Catholic Church\n1953: Holy Trinity Catholic Church",
