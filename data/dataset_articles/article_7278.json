That's OK, my cognitive decline since I smashed my face open has helped me to slow down and helped me to have a more restful finished 2025.\"\nNoting she'd experienced \"the most restful holiday\" season she'd ever had, Evangeline added: \"That's a good thing. [I'm] feeling extraordinarily grateful and blessed to be able to play one more day, one more year on this beautiful living planet. That is my concussion update. Thank you all for caring.\"\nThe Ant-Man actress has an \"uphill battle\" to get back to full health.\nShe captioned her video: \"Comforting to know my cognitive decline isn't just peri-menopause, discomforting to know what an uphill battle it will be to try to reverse the deficiencies.\n\"Thank you all for always asking, for always caring, and for your continued prayers.\"\nEvangeline detailed her accident on Instagram in May.\nShe wrote on Instagram at the time: \"I fainted at the beach, and fell face first into a boulder.\n\"At the hospital, the nurses and doctor went straight into action, more determined to find the cause of my blackout than to stitch up the hole punctured into my face by the rock. I smiled wryly at them. 'You won't find anything.' I said with a woozy voice.\"\n>>\n© 2026\nBang Showbiz, NZCity\nTop Stories\nRUGBY\nKiwi Ben Robb will be throwing stress-free at the professional darts tour qualifying school in Germany starting overnight\nMore...\nBUSINESS\nChristchurch has been named the country's most turbulent airport for the second year running\nMore...\nToday's News\nNews Search\nEntertainment\nNZ News\nNewsLinks\nNZ Web\nPower Search\n© 2026\nNew Zealand City Ltd",
