  "text": "The 35th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown approaches, Hong Kong's top catholic priest, Cardinal Stephen Chow Sau-yan, has urged residents to 'proactively forgive' those responsible for the event's wounds and move towards 'reconciliation and healing.'\nIn an article published in the\nCatholic newspaper Sunday Examiner, Chow emphasized that forgiveness does not mean forgetting but rather letting go of 'unending sadness and resentments.' He encouraged different parties to move beyond 'finger-pointing and the painful 'I will never forgive' mindset.'\nWhy this matters: The call for forgiveness and reconciliation by Hong Kong's Cardinal Stephen Chow Sau-yan has significant implications for the city's relationship with China and the world, as it addresses a sensitive and still-unresolved issue. The outcome of this call could have far-reaching consequences for Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy.\nThe 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown occurred on June 4, 1989, when the Chinese military violently suppressed student-led protests in Beijing, resulting in an unknown number of civilian deaths. The event has left a deep wound in the psyche of many, with Hong Kong residents annually gathering for a\nlive candlelight vigil to mourn the victims.\nHowever, the vigil has not been officially held since 2019, and the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the event, disbanded in 2021. The city authorities refused to grant permission for the event in 2020 and 2021, citing health risks amid the Covid-19 pandemic.\nEarlier this week, seven people, including Chow Hang-tung, the former vice-chairwoman of the alliance, were arrested for allegedly publishing\npress releases related to the crackdown and inciting hatred towards the local and central governments. Chow Hang-tung is currently in remand pending a national security trial for allegedly inciting subversion through her work with the alliance.\nThe arrests mark the first under the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, which was enacted in March and carries a maximum punishment of seven years in prison for sedition offenses. One suspect remains in remand, while six others were released on bail.\nCardinal Chow's message emphasizes the importance of forgiveness in achieving reconciliation and healing. He wrote, 'I would like to say something that conveys sadness and hope, coexisting in the life-sapping event that took place 35 years ago in the capital city.' Chow urged different parties to 'move beyond finger-pointing and the painful 'I will never forgive' mindset,' stressing that forgiveness is necessary for reconciliation and healing to become a reality.\nThe Tiananmen Square crackdown has left a lasting impact on many, with the incident still disturbing many even years later. The recent arrests of seven individuals, including Chow Hang-tung, have sparked concerns about the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong.\nCardinal Chow's call for forgiveness and reconciliation offers a path towards healing, urging residents to let go of past resentments and move forward together, with the 35th anniversary approaching.\nKey Takeaways\n- Cardinal Stephen Chow urges Hong Kong residents to \"proactively forgive\" those responsible for Tiananmen Square crackdown.\n- Forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting, but letting go of \"unending sadness and resentments.\"\n- 7 people, including Chow Hang-tung, arrested for allegedly inciting hatred towards governments related to Tiananmen Square.\n- Cardinal Chow's message emphasizes forgiveness for reconciliation and healing.\n- The call for forgiveness has significant implications for Hong Kong's relationship with China and the world.",
