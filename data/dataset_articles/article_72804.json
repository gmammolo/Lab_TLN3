  "text": "Sadie Robertson, Host of 11th Annual K-LOVE Fan Awards, Encourages This Generation to ‘Be the Light of the World’\n-\nMilton QuintanillaCrosswalk Headlines Contributor\n- Published May 31, 2024\nAuthor and podcast host Sadie Robertson Huff encourages this generation of young Christians to “be the light of the world.”\nHuff, who rose to fame in the reality series “Duck Dynasty,” will host the 11th annual K-LOVE Fan Awards along with Brandon Lake on TBN at 8:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. ET. She is also nominated for the Podcast of the Year Award for her “WHOA That’s Good” podcast.\n“What an honor to know that people care about it, and are nominating it,” Huff told\n Church Leaders. “If people listen to my podcast and receive what I receive when listening to others’ podcasts, that is so special to me.”\nMoreover, she encouraged this generation of young Christians to “be the light of the world” because it’s what “\nJesus said” for his followers to be.\n“I think when things get dark, it’s so tempting to do what he said not to do and hide and be like, ‘Oh, it’s so dark,’ and get scared,” Huff said.\nCan we embed this GT video as well:\nSadie Robertson Huff | 2024 K LOVE Fan Awards (red carpet) from ccm-magazine on GodTube.\nBut “you” are called “to actually help make the world a better place” by being that light, she continued. “So it’s not the time to cower back. It’s not the time to hide; it’s actually the time to fully take him at his word and be the light.”\nHuff hopes that people can begin to take that command “seriously and take on the call of their life” that Jesus has given them.\n“In this generation, we struggle a lot with our identity—with who we are,” Huff said. “And I love that that’s one place in Scripture that Jesus says, ‘You are the light of the world.’ Like that is your identity.”\n“And when you step into that,” she concluded. “I think people are gonna be a lot more confident in who they were created to be because they’ll be living it.”\nImage Courtesy: ©GettyImages/Terry Wyatt / Stringer\nMilton Quintanilla is a freelance writer and content creator.
