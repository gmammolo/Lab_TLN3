  "text": "CNA Staff, May 31, 2024 / 06:00 am Marching under a brutal south Texas sun, Charlie McCullough stopped this week to briefly talk to a young bystander as the southern route of the National Eucharistic Pilgrimage passed through Victoria. The twentysomething man, who grew up Protestant and in the foster care system, had lots of questions for McCullough about what this large group of Catholics was doing, and why. Later on, McCullough said he encountered the young man again — he told him he had not only been inspired to pray for the first time in years, but he also wanted to continue to accompany the pilgrimage, despite not yet being Catholic. McCullough, who is one of the 23 young men and women accompanying the Eucharist all the way to Indianapolis, said although he doesn’t expect to see the young man again in this life, he hopes to reunite with him one day in heaven. “On pilgrimage, it’s so easy to see the best in people,” McCullough said at a Wednesday press conference with several fellow Perpetual Pilgrims, adding that he believes it is “the presence of the Lord bringing out the best in people.” The Juan Diego Route, the southernmost of the four, began in Brownsville, Texas , and has included many distinctly Hispanic expressions of Catholicism.",
