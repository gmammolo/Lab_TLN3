We have variable winds here. We do encounter flare-ups, and our contingency plans kick into place, he said.He said the fire has been contained in the most critical areas.\nStoffels said several farms and homesteads are in close proximity to the fire area.He said the number of structures that have been damaged is unconfirmed at this stage. With a delicate fire like this, you can t just have people access the areas at will and we have to control that as well. We have kept people out of the fire area, hence the evacuations for the flare-ups. Stoffels said they re expecting another hot day and are hoping for the best.\nenca- 39 minutes ago\nMop-up operations underway in Mossel Bay after wildfires\nLatest News\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSources\n⁞",
