  "text": "Gloucester Cathedral and the High Sheriff of Gloucestershire extend a warm welcome to all to attend a special service celebrating volunteers across the county of Gloucestershire.\nThe High Sheriff of Gloucestershire’s Service of Thanksgiving for Volunteers, taking place on Saturday 8 June, coincides with National Volunteers Week, an initiative that celebrates volunteering efforts by recognising and thanking volunteers for their contribution to local communities.\nOrganised by the High Sheriff of Gloucestershire Mark Hurrell, the service at Gloucester Cathedral focuses on highlighting the positive impact of volunteering organisations across the city, county and diocese.\nIt is also an opportunity to express gratitude for those who give their time, energy, and passion to make a positive difference to the Gloucestershire community.\nVolunteers are particularly welcome to attend.\nMark Hurrell, the High Sheriff of Gloucestershire, said: “A key part of the High Sheriff’s role is to encourage volunteering and citizenship. Gloucestershire is blessed with over 150,000 volunteers who give up countless hours to help others.\n“This sense of selflessness is something that King Charles holds close to his chest and, as someone who holds a Warrant from the King, I think it’s important for people to come together to celebrate the work of those who support their communities in such an important way.”\nThe Very Reverend Andrew Zihni, Dean of Gloucester, said: “Gloucester Cathedral recognises the importance of volunteers, as we ourselves rely on volunteers in their hundreds to help with the day-to-day operation of the Cathedral’s mission and outreach.\n“From helping in our community outreach programmes, to providing a warm welcome to worshippers and visitors, we could not fulfil our service to the city, county, diocese and more widely without our volunteers. We hope that this Service of Thanksgiving will bring joy and encouragement to all volunteers.”\nThe service takes place on Saturday 8 June, 4.30pm, at Gloucester Cathedral . There is no booking required to attend the service, and entry is free.",
