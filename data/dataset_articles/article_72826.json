  "text": "“Bridgerton” star Adjoa Andoh recently discussed the importance of the role faith has played in her life and how the church has always been her “go-to space.” Andoh explained, sharing that her parents even met through her mother’s vicar, “Faith was big in my mother’s family.” The actress attended her village’s chapel and church, saying, “I was the kid that went three times on a Sunday, did the flower arranging and went to Bible class in the week.”\nAs she got older, Andoh stopped going to church as regularly but “would always go to church on high days and holidays, wherever I was.” She explained, “It’s a place of peace, and I think a late teenager/early 20s person needs peace. It would always be my go-to space; that never changed.” Andoh started attending church regularly again when her eldest daughter started going to a church school. She said, “I was just coming home, really. I just needed the shove. And that’s been my church ever since. I got married there. My daughter got married there. I became a reader in 2009.”\nView this post on Instagram\nOne of her sermons is even available on YouTube, where she\nreminded viewers that “we are family. God’s family. Our faith is in a God of redemption and justice and love.” Andoh’s children are equally passionate about their faith. Her middle daughter, Daisy, is even studying for a Ph.D. in theology. “We have great conversations about thinking about the Bible in the context of when it was written,” the actress said of her family. “Who was it written for? Who it was written by? What was going on at the time?” Andoh still thinks of church as a safe place to process thoughts and emotions.\nShe explained, “For me, church is the place where we come in all our differences and all our difficulties. It’s the place where you can be a hot mess; you don’t have to be fine. It’s you and God. As a community, we need to open those spaces so people always feel welcome.” Andoh continued, “Our job [as Christians] is to make the space so people can be in conversation, in relationship, in the peace, the solitude, the comfort — whatever they need — with God.”",
