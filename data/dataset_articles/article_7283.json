  "text": "Updated 8 January 2026 at 11:31 IST\nIndore-Like Water Scare Hits Greater Noida: Sewage Leakage Into Drinking Water Triggers Health Alert - Vomiting, Diarrhoea and Fever Cases Rise\nGreater Noida Sector Delta 1 faces a water leak scare as residents report vomiting, diarrhoea and fever, raising fears of Indore and Gandhinagar‑like outbreaks.\nIndia News- 2 min read\nNew Delhi: The water crisis that has already shaken Indore and Gandhinagar is now causing alarm in Uttar Pradesh. In Greater Noida’s Sector Delta 1, dozens of residents have reported falling ill with vomiting, diarrhoea and fever after sewage allegedly mixed with the drinking water supply.\nRising Panic in the Neighbourhood\nReports suggest that the first cases of diarrhoea appeared earlier in the week, with children among those affected. Families in the area fear that the situation could mirror Indore’s tragedy, where contaminated water led to multiple deaths and hospitalisations, or Gandhinagar’s outbreak of suspected typhoid. The recurring leaks in pipelines have added to the anxiety, as residents worry about ageing infrastructure and repeated failures in maintenance.\nOfficial Action Taken\nOn Wednesday, teams from the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) and the health department visited the affected blocks. A broken pipeline was repaired, and two more leaks were identified and replaced. Authorities distributed medicines, oral rehydration solution (ORS), glucose and antacids to households. Water samples were collected and sent for laboratory testing to confirm the extent of contamination.\nOfficials later stated that the situation was under control and that the repaired pipelines had restored normal water supply. A health camp was also set up nearby, where residents received medical attention. Most were advised to take ORS, while a few were given medicines to ease symptoms.\nAdvertisement\nBroader Concerns Across India\nThe Greater Noida incident adds to a growing pattern of water-related health scares across the country. Indore’s contaminated water crisis and Gandhinagar’s suspected typhoid outbreak have already highlighted the risks of poor infrastructure and sewage mixing with drinking water. Now, with Noida reporting similar symptoms, experts warn that urban centres may be facing a larger public health challenge.\nFor residents of Sector Delta 1, the immediate worry is whether their water supply is truly safe. For India, the bigger question is whether these scattered outbreaks are isolated incidents or signs of a deeper crisis in urban water management.\nAdvertisement\nGet Current Updates on India News, Entertainment News, Cricket News along with Latest News and Web Stories from India and around the world.\nPublished By : Priya Pathak\nPublished On: 8 January 2026 at 11:13 IST",
