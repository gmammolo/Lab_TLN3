  "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - Pride Month begins this weekend, but there are many places that promote LGBTQ Equality all year round. Including a local Catholic Church in Kansas City that wants to turn their message of unity and equality into action during June. At a time when many churches report smaller turnout, membership at the Christ the King Independent Catholic Church is holding steady as they continue to promote being a welcoming place no matter who you choose to love. Growing up in a small town in rural Kansas, Jenri Conley says she struggled to feel accepted for being a lesbian. “I felt like a bad Catholic just because of who I am and have gone through periods feeling a lot of anxiety,” expressed Jenri Conley, who attends Christ the King. “Since coming here it’s improved my life so much.” This Pride Month, Father Taylor Tracy , who’s openly gay, and his clergy are determined to reach more people like Jenri. “It’s all about meeting people where they’re at,” Father Tracy explained. “So rather than try to fix people it’s all about journeying and healing with them alongside them. These are all our sheep; these are the blood of children of God that have been ostracized through no fault of their own.” Throughout June, Christ the King will have booths at as many events as possible. Their goal they say is to show everyone your orientation doesn’t define your relationship with God. “God loves each and every one of us unconditionally without reservations,” Conley said. “Without exceptions. I think it’s important to flourish who you are and not try to please other people.” “This isn’t a gay church; this is the church and it’s a place where you are welcome unconditionally,” Father Tracy added. “You can come and raise children and receive the sacraments. We shouldn’t wait until we’re in heaven to build that community.” This year Christ the King Independent Catholic Community has a congregation of 125 each week. In August, they’re adding a second mass every Sunday to keep up with the growth. Copyright 2024 KCTV. All rights reserved.",
