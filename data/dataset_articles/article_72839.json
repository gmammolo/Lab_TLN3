  "text": "Pope , Francis | 31/05/2024 Descargar documento Compartir A lot has changed since this moment exactly 10 years ago on June 8 when this happened.\nThe president of Israel and the president of the Palestinian Authority traveled to the Vatican to pray for peace with Pope Francis. A decade later, the Pope wants to celebrate the anniversary and, above all, to pray for peace in the Holy Land. In 2014, this is what the three leaders had to say:\nPOPE FRANCIS\nMany, all too many, of those children have been innocent victims of war and violence, saplings cut down at the height of their promise. It is our duty to ensure that their sacrifice is not in vain. The memory of these children instills in us the courage of peace .\nSHIMON PERES\nPresident of Israel\nI was young, now I'm old. I experienced war. I tasted peace. Never will I forget the families, parents and children who paid the cost of war. All my life I shall never stop to act for peace.\nMAHMOUD ABBAS\nPresident of Palestine\nWe want peace for ourselves and for our neighbors. We want prosperity and thoughts of peace for us and for others. Lord, listen to our prayers. Give victory to our requests, because You are the most just and merciful, God of all worlds.\nThat day, the Vatican Gardens were filled with the music of three faiths: Jewish, Christian and Muslim. Among the Christian representatives were also ecumenical delegations. For example, the Patriarch of Constantinople, Bartholomew was present.\nThe event to mark the anniversary and pray for peace between Israel and Palestine will take place on Saturday, June 8, at 9:30 a.m. at the same spot in the Vatican Gardens.\nJRB\nTR: KG\nNoticias relacionadas Pope Francis to publish a document on the Heart of Jesus in September Pope , Papal texts | 31/05/2024\nHow will Pope Francis celebrate Corpus Christi in Rome?
