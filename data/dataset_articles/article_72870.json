  "text": "On Sunday morning, 26 May, Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity, the final event of the first World Children’s Day was a Mass celebrated in Saint Peter’s Square. Addressing the children gathered, Pope Francis emphasised the profound unity and love within the Holy Trinity, describing it as a family. “We pray to God, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. How many ‘gods’ are there? One in three persons”, he explained. The following is the English text of the Pope’s homily. Dear boys and girls, we are here to pray, to pray together, and to pray to God. Is that okay? Do you agree with this? We pray to God, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. How many “gods” are there? One in three persons: the Father who created all of us and who loves us very much. When we pray to God the Father, what is the name of the prayer that we all pray together? [Respond: Our Father] We always ask God, in the Our Father, to accompany us in life and to help us grow. What is the name of the Son? [Respond: Jesus] I can’t hear well! [Respond again: Jesus]. Yes, Jesus. We pray to Jesus to support us, to be close to us. When we receive the Eucharist, we receive Jesus. Jesus also forgives us all sins. Is it true that Jesus forgives everything? [Respond: Yes] I didn’t hear, what happens... Is it true? Yes. But does he always forgive everything? [Respond: Yes] Always, always, always? [Respond: Yes] If there is a man or a woman, a sinner with many sins, does Jesus forgive him or her? [Respond: Yes] Does he forgive even the ugliest of sinners? [Respond: Yes] Yes! Never forget this: Jesus forgives everything and always, but we must have the humility to ask for forgiveness. “Forgive me, Lord, I have done wrong. I am weak. Life has many difficulties but you forgive everything. I would like to change my life and you will help me”. I didn’t hear well, is it true that Jesus forgives everything? [Respond: Yes] Very good, don’t forget this. Now, the problem is: who is the Holy Spirit? It is not easy, because the Holy Spirit is God, and he is within us. We receive the Holy Spirit in Baptism, and in the Sacraments. The Holy Spirit is the one who accompanies us in life. We know this, so let’s say it together, “The Holy Spirit accompanies us in life”. All together, “The Holy Spirit accompanies us in life”. He is the one who tells us in our hearts the good things we need to do. Once again: “The Holy Spirit accompanies us in life”. He is the one within who rebukes us when we do something wrong. “The Holy Spirit...” You already forgot, I can’t hear you... One more time! The Holy Spirit is the one who gives us strength and comforts us in difficulties. Together, “The Holy Spirit accompanies us through life”. Dear brothers and sisters, boys and girls, we are all happy because we believe. Faith makes us happy. And we believe in God who is Father, Son and Holy Spirit. All together, “Father, Son and Holy Spirit”. The Father who created us, Jesus who saved us, and the Holy Spirit who does what? Thank you very much to all of you, but know that, we Christians, also have a mother, what is the name of our mother? What is the name of our Mother in Heaven? [Respond: Mary] Do you know how to pray to Our Lady? [Respond: Yes] Are you sure? Let’s do it now. [Recitation of the Hail Mary] Good boys and girls, you are all very good. The Father created us, the Son saved us, and what does the Holy Spirit do? Good! God bless you, pray for us, so that we can keep going, all of us, pray for parents, pray for grandparents, and pray for sick children. There are many sick children behind me. Always pray and especially pray for peace, for there to be no wars. Now we continue the Mass, but so we don’t forget, what did the Holy Spirit do? Good!",
