  "text": "ACI Africa, May 31, 2024 / 13:00 pm Peace reigns inside Dar Mariam, the residence of the Salesian Sisters in Sudan, despite the fact that it has been surrounded by heavy gunfire and bombed multiple times as war rages on in the northeastern African country. At the community, located in Shajara, about four and a half miles from Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, people displaced by the war, which has been raging there for two years now, say their relationship with God has grown. According to Father Jacob Thelekkadan, a Catholic priest of Indian descent who served in Sudan for years before the war broke out and now can’t leave, residents of Dar Mariam have had a number of life-threatening experiences — a situation that Thelekkadan, a member of the [Salesians of Don Bosco](https://www.sdb.org/en/Who_are_we_/), describes as “the experience of the nearness of God” from the time the community was first [bombed](https://www.aciafrica.org/index.php/news/9560/salesian-sisters-in-sudan-counting-losses-as-bomb-hits-residence) on Nov. 3, 2023.",
