Escucha sin anuncios y sin esperas con iVoox Premium When was the last time you prayed a rosary? Whether it’s been a day, a week, or many years, there’s no better time than NOW to pray one! We usually talk about God on this show, today we’re going to talk TO Him! If you aren’t familiar, the rosary is an ancient prayer based in scripture. The Hail Mary and the Our Father are taken straight from the Gospels.These well-known prayers function as a background to meditate upon mysteries that are based on the life of Christ, taken from scripture. To help keep you even more focused on the beautiful mysteries in the rosary, I’m going to read a bit of scripture between each Hail Mary using the Rosary app. If you’ve never prayed the rosary this way before, it’s a fun and new way to explore this ancient practice! Today we are praying the Joyful Mysteries of the rosary, which are commonly prayed on Monday and Saturday. The other mysteries are the Sorrowful Mysteries (Tuesday and Friday), the Glorious Mysteries (Wednesday and Saturday) and the Luminous Mysteries (Thursday).
