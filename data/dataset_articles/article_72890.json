  "text": "Christians across America, and anyone who endorses \"faith, family and freedom,\" have been given their marching orders for the November presidential election. The instructions do not include WHO to vote for, but the messaging is clear. \"The Left is not only waging legal warfare against Donald Trump. They are attempting to prevent half the country from having any say in the governance of our nation, and they have weaponized the legal system to ensure their success at any cost,\" began a statement from Gary Bauer, senior vice president of public policy for the James Dobson Family Institute. \"They are already using our legal system to go after pro-life activists and patriotic Christians who defend religious liberty. The Deep State is spying on conservative parents and churches, treating them like enemies of the state. They have even gone so far as to compare caring parents to terrorists. \"The Left has repeatedly [contended] that conservatives are a threat to our democracy. Yet, they are the ones who are aggressively attacking our constitutional Republic with blatant disregard for our fundamental rights. We cannot remain silent against such explicit tyranny.\" [Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

The totalitarian impulse of the neo-Marxist Left is to suppress and silence political opposition using any means necessary.\" For 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.
