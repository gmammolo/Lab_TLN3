  "text": "Reflecting on his recent reinstatement, Emir Muhammadu Sanusi of Kano emphasized the acceptance of God’s will without questioning it.\nIn a sermon delivered during Friday prayers at the Kofar Kudu Central Mosque in Kano, Emir Sanusi encouraged people to recognize that all occurrences are part of God’s plan.\nSanusi stressed the significance of embracing Allah’s decisions wholeheartedly, emphasizing that it is not for humans to question God’s divine reasoning.\nHe expressed, “Gratitude is essential in both favorable and adverse circumstances. Understanding that our experiences are predetermined by God is crucial, and we should be content with His choices for us.”\nEmphasizing the importance of supplications during the upcoming Zhul Hijja period, Emir Sanusi highlighted the benefits of observing religious practices during these days.\nThe reinstatement of Emir Sanusi by Governor Abba Yusuf of Kano State resulted in the removal of Aminu Ado Bayero from the throne last week.\nThis decision came after the Kano State House of Assembly repealed the Emirate Law, which had divided the Kano Emirate into five separate emirates.\nThe legislative action not only annulled the five emirates but also led to the restoration of Emir Sanusi to his position.",
