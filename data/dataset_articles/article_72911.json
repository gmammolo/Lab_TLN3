  "text": "Kizito Osudibia Set to Exhibit at HKBF 2024 with Book That Calls for Peace Out of the Ashes of Religious Violence\nMuch like Hong Kong itself, the Hong Kong Book Fair is a prestigious event that takes global ideas from authors around the world and helps circulate them to readers across Asia. For Kizito Chike Osudibia, a Colorado-based Catholic priest and dedicated political analyst, one of the most important ideas today is to lay the foundations of world peace, especially from religions often accused of creating conflict. He makes the case for it in his book “Religion and the Global Resurgence of Violence.”\nWEBWIRE– Friday, May 31, 2024\nReadersMagnet will display “Religion and the Global Resurgence of Violence” by Kizito Chike Osudibia at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2024.\nThe\nHong Kong Book Fair is one of Asia’s largest, busiest book fairs, and it offers authors from around the world an opportunity to spread their ideas to more reading audiences across the East.\nIt’s a very fitting venue for Kizito Chike Osudibia, whose book tackles a most urgent global challenge once again taking today’s headlines: violence. The of his book says it all: “Religion and the Global Resurgence of Violence: Connection of the Abrahamics.”\nFrom the very start, the book tackles a troubling and persistent accusation that religion is the cause of today’s most violent conflicts. To an extent, Osudibia actually agrees and goes to considerable lengths to validate this sentiment.\nHowever, he also makes the radical proposal that the very same religions that have historically fostered these conflicts also have, at their very root, the ability to end it all and create a lasting peace that ultimately lives up to the faith each one professes.\nA Catholic priest, Osudibia currently serves as the pastor of Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and is also a dedicated scholar of political science. Aside from religion, he has also published several books on the politics of Nigeria but now sees that the leaders of all three leading Abrahamic faiths play a crucial role in fostering peace on a global stage.\nVisitors to the 2024 Hong Kong Book Fair can find “Religion and the Global Resurgence of Violence: Connection of the Abrahamics” displayed at the self-publishing and book marketing company ReadersMagnet’s booth exhibit. Copies are also available directly from\nAmazon, Barnes & Noble, and ReadersMagnet Bookstore.\n“Religion and the Global Resurgence of Violence: Connection of the Abrahamics”\nAuthor: Kizito Chike Osudibia\nPublished date: June 22, 2023\nPublisher: ReadersMagnet, LLC\nGenre: Political & Social Sciences\nAuthor Bio\nKizito Chike Osudibia is a priest of the Catholic Church. Currently, he is pastor of Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The author, who is a scholar and pastor, holds a BPhil (1989), a BTh (1993), an MA in political science (2010), a doctorate degree in civil and organizational leadership, EdD (2015) and a doctorate in Political Science, PhD (2018).\nHe has confidence that ideas change, rule, and sustain the world of change. Hence, the idea that the Abrahamic religions, numbering more than half of the world’s population, can bring enduring peace to the globe is, for him, a desideratum. His arguments speak for themselves in this book.\nAmong his published books are “Nigeria: The Case of Fragmentation” (1995), “Challenges to the Fourth Republic: Nigerian Connexion” (2001), and “Revolution: A Dangerous Option for Nigeria” (2004).\n( Press Release Image:\nhttps://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/55089/322540/322540-1.jpg )\nWebWireID322540\n- Contact Information\n- ReadersMagnet\n- Publishing & Marketing\n- ReadersMagnet LLC\n- (1) 800 805-0762\n[Contact via E-mail](contact-submitter.asp?aId=322540)\nThis news content may be integrated into any legitimate news gathering and publishing effort.
