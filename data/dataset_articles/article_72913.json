  "text": "Santo Domingo.- The bishop of the Archdiocese of Santo Domingo, Monsignor José Amable Duran Tineo, expressed hope and prayer that the upcoming tax reform will benefit the poorest citizens.\n“The necessary fiscal reform should not favor those who already have the most, the influential and powerful groups, but rather the poorest,” said the religious leader to hundreds of parishioners during the Corpus Christi Day Eucharistic mass held at the Faro a Colón.\nDuran Tineo emphasized that he hopes the reform will lead to a fairer distribution of wealth, including significant improvements in salaries, the social security system, and healthcare.\nHe stated, “Although social assistance is necessary, we do not aspire to perpetuate a state of dependency. We advocate for a homeland where social justice prevails, as it is the only guarantee of peace and well-being for all.”\nThe bishop highlighted the disparity in the thriving economy, noting that only 10% of the population benefits from the prosperity. “This results in the luxurious lifestyles of a few and the poverty of the majority, leaving many families in misery,” he said.\nTo address this imbalance, Duran Tineo suggested heeding Pope Francis’ advice to foster a world of fraternal charity, moving away from a society driven by self-interest and utilitarian partnerships.",
