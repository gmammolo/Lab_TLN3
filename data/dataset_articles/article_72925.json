  "text": "Diocese’s first American-born Vietnamese priest will be ordained with 3 others on Saturday PROSPECT HEIGHTS — FOUR MEN WILL BE ORDAINED AS PRIESTS for the Diocese of Brooklyn on Saturday, one of them the first American-born Vietnamese priest to serve here. Bishop Robert Brennan will preside at the Mass of Ordination on Saturday, June 1, at the 1,500-person capacity co-Cathedral of St. Joseph in Prospect Heights. All four ordinands, from different backgrounds, have been serving their transitional diaconate year, and three of them were born on other continents. The Minnesota-born Deacon Randy Thanh Nguyen, 38, settled in Elmhurst, Queens, which is part of the Diocese of Brooklyn. A graduate of Hunter College, he speaks Vietnamese, Spanish and English, and pursued medical studies before hearing a call to the priesthood. Deacon Caetano Moura de Oliveira, 31, was born in Jundiaí, Brazil, into a devout Catholic family who prayed together as a family as well as at Mass. He received his calling during a youth pilgrimage in Brasilia. Deacon Luis Marquez, 38, a native of Colombia who immigrated to the U.S. in 2002, earned a degree in modern languages and taught Spanish before discerning his call. He has expressed special enthusiasm for serving in a diocese rich in various cultures, languages, and communities. Deacon Tobechkwu Jude Offiah, 37, was born in Lagos, the former capital city of Nigeria, and earned a bachelor’s degree in that country. Deacon Offiah entered St. Joseph’s Seminary and College in New York, and he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2022. The 11 a.m. Ordination Mass will be broadcast live on NET-TV, the cable channel of the Diocese of Brooklyn, as well as [livestreamed](http://netny.tv/watch-now). ✰✰✰",
