  "text": "INDORE, MP- Indore was the scene of an urgent medical diversion on Tuesday evening as an Air India Express (IX) service from Jaipur to Bengaluru made an unscheduled landing after a one-year-old boy aboard the flight fell gravely ill. The flight crew and emergency responders worked swiftly to provide aid, but the child was later pronounced dead.\nThe aircraft, operating as Flight IX1240, departed Jaipur Airport (JAI) at 17:30 local time and was en route to Kempegowda International Airport (BLR) when the situation unfolded. The unexpected turn of events prompted the crew to seek the nearest suitable landing field.\nAir India Express Emergency Landing\nShortly after takeoff, the young passenger, identified as Mohammad Abraar, began showing signs of acute breathing difficulty while seated with his family. Traveling with his parents and older brother, the infant’s distress quickly became the focus of the cabin crew’s attention.\nThe crew followed established onboard emergency procedures, engaging in rapid assessment and using available medical supplies to try to stabilise the child’s condition.\nThe pilot communicated with air traffic control, requesting priority landing clearance in light of the deteriorating medical situation.\nAir traffic controllers at the destination and alternate airports coordinated to find the closest suitable airport with adequate ground medical support.\nOfficials determined that Indore Airport (IDR) was best positioned to receive the ailing passenger and allow quick transfer to local medical services.\nEmergency Landing Details\nFlight IX1240 touched down at Indore at approximately 20:00, where ambulances and medical teams were already standing by to receive the sick child. Local doctors boarded the aircraft to perform an initial assessment before escorting the boy to a nearby hospital.\nDespite the urgent attention and continued care, hospital staff confirmed that the child was brought in without vital signs.\nThe cause of the severe breathing problem remains under review by health and aviation officials, though no official statement has detailed a specific diagnosis at this time.\nFamilies traveling with young children often carry necessary documentation, and it is routine for airlines to advise parents to monitor infants closely during pressure and cabin changes.\nIn this case, the rapid onset of symptoms and the child’s age presented significant challenges for both inflight crew and the airport medical personnel.\nAirport ground staff assisted the family throughout the transfer process, providing logistical support as authorities completed necessary formalities. The remainder of the passengers experienced only a brief delay before the flight continued toward its scheduled destination.\nAirline and Airport Response\nRepresentatives of the airline issued a statement expressing condolences to the bereaved family and noting that the diversion was conducted in accordance with international safety and medical protocols. They affirmed that the crew acted promptly to seek appropriate care.\nIndore Airport authorities confirmed that emergency services were activated immediately upon notification of the incoming medical diversion. Medical teams coordinated with airfield safety officers to ensure an expedited transfer once the aircraft arrived.\nThe incident highlights the importance of emergency preparedness in commercial aviation, particularly on domestic and regional sectors, where alternate airports can play a key role in lifesaving diversions.\nBottom Line\nThe tragic death of the one-year-old on board Flight IX1240 emphasises the challenges faced during medical emergencies in flight.\nWhile the diversion to Indore enabled immediate medical intervention, the outcome underscores the critical nature of rapid response and the limitations that crews and ground teams encounter in such high-stakes scenarios.\nStay tuned with us.
