  "text": "Willie Robertson Urges Believers to Not ‘Disqualify’ Themselves from Sharing the Gospel By Movieguide® Contributor DUCK DYNASTY’s Willie Robertson encourages fans to continue to follow God and share the Gospel, whether or not they feel qualified to. In his new book, “ [Gospeler](https://www.thomasnelson.com/p/gospeler-book/),” Robertson describes how he “allowed [his] priorities to shift, and faith and family were no longer at the top.” He wants to remind people that the Christian life isn’t a “straight line” and will involve “being wrong” and repentance. “This is huge. That’s one of the reasons that a lot of people will disqualify themselves from telling anyone else about their faith is because they feel like ‘I haven’t figured it out either,'” he [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyxBj_9GGss) on Allie Beth Stuckey’s “Relatable” podcast. He explained how the disciple Peter typifies this feeling. In [John 21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2021&version=NIV) after Peter denies Jesus and following Jesus’ resurrection, he and a few other disciples go back to fishing — their occupation before becoming disciples. Robertson [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyxBj_9GGss), “I think Peter had went back to fishing because I think he was done. I think he thought, ‘I blew it. I mean, here I was, I had been following this guy for three years, all in. I’d seen all the things.’ I think he was just going to go back and probably tell a sad story about, ‘I was there. I was one of the ones.'” While they are fishing, Jesus appears to them and tells them to cast their net to the right side of the boat. They follow his instructions and catch so many fish they can’t bring their nets in. When they realize it’s Jesus on the shore, Peter jumps off the boat. During their meal together, “Jesus specifically goes back to him and says, ‘Hey. I have a job for you. I need you to do something and care for my sheep and feed my sheep,'” Robertson said. Peter could’ve rejected God’s calling, looking back at how he betrayed Jesus. Instead, though, he embraces what Jesus tells him to do and goes on to lead the church in Acts. “I think a lot of us will just disqualify ourselves and spend tons of our life just on the sidelines going, ‘I’m out. I can’t.’ I felt that in my life as well. I felt that many times in my life,” Robertson [continued](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyxBj_9GGss). Regardless of how we feel, though, Robertson reminds us that God calls us to share the Gospel. “It’s not, when you get salvation, that’s awesome for you, but it’s all about sharing it with others,” he [told](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/may/17/willie-robertsons-new-book-on-sharing-gospel-and-w/) the Washington Times. “Jesus, I think He was clear on that, saying, ‘Go make disciples, go baptize people, go teach people.” He explores how we can each do this in “Gospeler: Turning Darkness into Light One Conversation at a Time.” “I’ve loved sharing the Gospel with people for as long as I remember,” [said](https://www.jubileecast.com/articles/31142/20240509/duck-dynasty-star-willie-robertson-releases-new-book-gospeler.htm) Robertson. “I saw it in my house growing up and I believe that most people want to share their faith, they just think they don’t know how. I’ve learned that all you have to do is care about people and want to give them an opportunity to hear the Good News.” Movieguide® recently [reported](https://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/millions-touched-willie-robertson-on-duck-dynastys-impact.html) on Robertson’s new book: Willie Robertson is sharing the impact THE BLIND has had on audiences and details about his latest book, “Gospeler: Turning Darkness into Light One Conversation at a Time.” “I think the message that [THE BLIND] puts out is a message that needs to be out…for marriages and the gospel and what God can do, how to change someone’s life—it’s all in there,” Robertson [told]Movieguide®. He continued, “I think in Christianity, and probably generally in life, we’re always like, ‘Hey, your past is behind you, and we’re looking ahead,’ unless they make a movie about it, and then we just live there, in the worst season of your life. But I think Dad knew as we talked to him about it that it was important to see where he was, and man, we have gotten so much feedback from people and how it’s helped them.” Share:",
