  "text": "(TMX) – Lenny Kravitz says he has been celibate for nearly a decade. The 60-year-old “American Woman” rocker made the revelation in an interview with The Guardian published Thursday, saying he has been celibate for nine years and plans to remain celibate until he is in a serious relationship. “It’s a spiritual thing,” he said, noting he may never find the right relationship. “I have become very set in my ways,” he said, “in the way I live.” Kravitz was married to actress Lisa Bonet from 1987 to 1993, and they share daughter Zoë Kravitz. The “Fly Away” singer revealed in his 2020 memoir, “Let Love Rule,” that he had once confronted his father Sy Kravitz for cheating on his mother Roxie Roker. Later in life, he realized he was too similar to his father for his liking. “After the marriage, I became more like him. I was becoming a player,” he confessed in the book. “I didn’t like it. I didn’t want to be that guy. So I had to tackle that and it took years.” After his marriage to Lisa Bonet, Kravitz went on to date Vanessa Paradis, and had failed engagements with Adriana Lima and Nicole Kidman. Last week, Kravitz released his 12th album, “Blue Electric Light.” Copyright 2024 TMX. All rights reserved.",
