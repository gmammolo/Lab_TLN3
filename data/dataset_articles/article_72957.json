Of course, community is important, but it's crucial to remember that we have the answers we're searching for within us, through our holy connection to the divine.\nWith his new book, Secret Place, Minister Vince Baker can guide you to a deeper knowledge of the New Covenant and help you find that intimate, holiest place that exists within you. Want to learn more? Just go to\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UK3t2BfE38\nGet Answers To Many Questions\nSecret Place, which is soon to be available on Amazon, strives to answer a range of questions you may have regarding God and your relationship with Him. Among these questions are \"What does it mean to know God?\", \"Why is making vows important to God?\", and \"Can I ask for anything in the New Covenant?\"\nBy reading Secret Place, you'll also get answers to questions like \"What does the Tabernacle of David Represent?\", \"What is the mystery of the first and second temples?\", and \"What is the hidden mystery of the Ark of the Covenant?\"\nAuthor Vince Baker strives to provide helpful scriptural interpretations and guidance for people like you, who are interested in fully diving into their spiritual journey and finding complete union with the Lord.\nThe Secret Place\nThe book's title, Secret Place, refers to \"a holy, private spiritual location within the temple of your own body\" where, as Vince Baker explains, you can engage in an intimate relationship with God. \"Everything you are looking for in your relationship with God is found in the Secret Place,\" says Vince Baker.\nWith this earth-shaking book, Vince Baker will guide you to better understand the valuable analogies that exist in the scriptures of the Bible, many of which speak to the \"secret place\" within each of us.\nSecret Place talks in-depth about the New Covenant and can help you understand exactly what it means for your personal relationship with God. If this is an unfamiliar concept to you, The New Covenant is a promise God made to forgive sins and restore a personal connection with those who have opened their hearts to Him. The New Covenant was initiated during the Last Supper as part of the Holy Communion and it still rings true today, all you have to do is look within yourself.\nAbout Vince Baker\nAlong with his books, Vince Baker offers ministry and public speaking services through Vince Baker Ministries.
