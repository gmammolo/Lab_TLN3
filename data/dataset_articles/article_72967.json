  "text": "It never ceases to amaze me at how the Bible is so beautifully woven together as an integrated whole. Critics allege that the Bible is nothing more than a thrown-together jumble of man-made disconnected ancient mythical writings that are unrelated and devoid of connecting themes. Nothing could be further from the truth. To the unbelieving skeptic, the scriptures are veiled and inscrutable. But to the spiritual seeker, those same scriptures come alive and reveal God’s deepest secrets to their open hearts. This is no accident … Jesus once prayed, in Matthew 11:24-26 , “I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things (the mysteries of the Kingdom of God as revealed in scripture) from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for this way was well pleasing in Your sight.” The “infants” He was referring to were people of all ages whose hearts are open in childlike dependence. The Bible is “God-breathed” and not a “jot or tittle” is out of place in its original languages. If God could create our magnificent universe with such precise order, why would His written account in scripture not be just as orderly? In Romans 16:25-27 , the Apostle Paul wrote: “Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past, but now has been disclosed, and through the Scriptures …” Recreating Mankind For example, one of the most momentous themes running through the Bible from cover-to-cover is God’s plan for the redemption of man. Most of us have heard of the rebellion of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and their subsequent spiritual and physical “fall” due to their sin. This is as relevant to us in our day as it was to our original parents in their day. Scripture tells us that we ALL have inherited the same fallen sin nature from our parents, going all the way back to our original progenitors in Eden. Absent a direct intervention by God, Adam and Eve would have been doomed to eternal separation from their Creator. But God DID intervene, preventing the whole of humanity from perishing. Read Genesis 3 for a description of how it all unfolded. And it is the same for us today. So, what does an “intervention” by God look like for us? God Switches on the Lights In the very first chapter of the Old Testament , in Genesis 1:1-4 , we read, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. And the earth was a formless and desolate emptiness, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. Then God said, ‘Let there be light’; and there was light. God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.” Here we have the first step in the salvation of any individual. People are born spiritually blind, a “formless and desolate emptiness,” in “darkness.” But the Spirit of God is watching (some translations say “brooding”). Then at just the right time, God steps in and “turns on the lights” — flooding the person’s inner being with God’s presence. That’s what it means to be born again. In 2 Corinthians 4:6 , in Paul’s second letter to the Corinthians in the New Testament , he tells us, “For God, who said, ‘Light shall shine out of darkness,’ is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.” Once enlightened, we can exercise faith in Christ and to see into His scriptures with new eyes. Bible commentator Bill MacDonald wrote, “Paul here compares the conversion of a sinner to the entrance of light at the dawn of creation. Originally God commanded light to shine out of darkness. He said, ‘Let there be light’ and there was light … in the first creation, God commanded the light to shine. But in the new creation, God Himself shines into our hearts (proactively). How much more personal this is!” How About You? Before I was saved, I can recall occasionally trying to read the scriptures and they were just a blur to me. At the time, I had no desire to follow them, only to challenge them, and that was why they were veiled to me … UNTIL … God turned on the lights, and boy was I in for a wild ride! It was as though I was given a pair of those funny glasses they used to give us in a 3D movie, and what was just a blur before, became crystal clear and multidimensional. Wow!! Sound familiar?
