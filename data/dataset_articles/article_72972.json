  "text": "There's strength in numbers. The Baton Rouge-based Fourth District Missionary Baptist Association has prioritized the \"solid foundation\" of Christian education to rebuild and strengthen its numbers to effectively fulfill the church's mission. \"Christian education is a necessity in our churches in this day and time. We can't make it without it,\" said the Rev. John Sanders, dean of the association and pastor of Second Baptist Church in Wilson. The Fourth District will offer biblical study and worship during its annual Congress of Christian Education set for Tuesday-Friday, June 7. The theme is \"Strengthening What Remains for the Work of the Ministry.\" The Congress has expanded to four locations this year. Meetings on Tuesday through Thursday are set for Mount Zion First Baptist Church, 356 T.J. Jemison Blvd., Baton Rouge; Shady Grove First Missionary Baptist Church, 16443 Plank Road, Baker; New Sunrise Baptist Church, 966 Maryland Ave., Port Allen; and Plymouth Rock Baptist Church, 588830 Farm Road, Plaquemine. All the parishes will join for the closing ceremony on Friday at Shady Grove. Youth classes will be held from 8 a.m. to noon Tuesday through Thursday at Shady Grove; Plymouth Rock; and Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church, 950 Seventh St., Port Allen. Classes will include \"Theology and History of Christianity,\" \"The Mission and Ministry of the Church,\" \"The Church and Today's Culture\" and \"Millennials in Ministry.\" The curriculum and teachers were approved by the national Sunday School Publishing Board. \"I believe we have the best Christian education system in the country,\" Sanders said. \"This Congress is going to be one of the best, because of the way it's set up. We just believe in excellence, and it's going to strengthen our churches. All our pastors need help in strengthening of the church because our pastors are going through some things right now.\" The \"strengthening\" theme is based on two passages of scriptures. From Revelation 3:2-4, Sanders drew parallels between district churches that have faced challenges since the pandemic and the churches in Revelation. \"God came to remind them and show them that they were in a very difficult position of actually being nonexistent. They were not doing what they were supposed to do,\" Sanders said. \"Most churches are struggling out of COVID. … A lot of people migrated. A lot of people simply didn't come back. We want to take the remnant that produces and multiplies because God's business is all about multiplication and reproducing.\" A passage from Ephesians 4:12-13 highlights unity. \"This is not the time for the church to be divided. We have to come together,\" Sanders said. \"We have to be relevant, and unity is a big part of that. We want to make sure we're bringing our people back with a message that God would have for all of us because this is way too important to drop the ball.\" For more information, call (225) 719-1346 or (225) 268-2766, email [Revjhsanders@yahoo.com](mailto:Revjhsanders@yahoo.com) or [doctorpdjones@gmail.com](mailto:doctorpdjones@gmail.com); or go to https://fourthdistrictmba.org/ .",
