  "text": "Gombe State Governor, Muhammadu Yahaya, on Friday charged the state’s intending pilgrims to use their spiritual journey to the Holy Land to pray for the state and the country to overcome the enormous socio-economic challenges facing its citizens. Yahaya gave the charge during a farewell address to the state’s intending pilgrims at the Gombe State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board office. Our correspondent reports that a total of 1,370 intending pilgrims are set for this year’s Hajj as the airlifting starts on Saturday Speaking on the current socio-economic realities in the country, Governor Inuwa Yahaya urged the pilgrims to intensify prayers for Allah’s intervention. He said, “Intensify prayers for yourselves, Gombe State, and Nigeria for Allah’s intervention in the current situation. Specifically, pray for a bumper harvest to overcome the high prices of foodstuffs in the markets. Our country is faced with multifaceted challenges; only through merciful intervention from Almighty Allah can we get through them.” Yahaya admonished the intending pilgrims to be good ambassadors of their state and country while in Saudi Arabia. “While in the Holy Land, please be good ambassadors of your communities, your local government areas, Gombe State, and Nigeria, so we can all be proud of you,” he appealed. He called on the pilgrims to avoid anything that may nullify their spiritual exercise, damage their personal or state’s reputation. Yahaya reminded them that in the Holy Land, the law can take its course on anyone found guilty of any mischievous or unwholesome act. While wishing the pilgrims a hitch-free Hajj exercise, the governor reassured them of his administration’s commitment to ensuring the best Hajj experience, from Nigeria to the Holy Land. He also promised that no one would be left behind, adding all pilgrims would be airlifted on time. The governor also charged Hajj officials at all levels to discharge their duties with sincerity, diligence, and patriotism to ensure a seamless Hajj exercise. Speaking earlier, Executive Secretary of the Gombe State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board, Sa’adu Hassan, expressed appreciation to the governor for his tireless commitment to ensuring a smooth Hajj operation. He also acknowledged the governor’s support for all intending pilgrims of Gombe State, including taking responsibility for animal sacrifices ( Hadaya), giving free food on Arafat Day, among, as well as approval of 200 Riyals for each pilgrim as Sallah gift among other efforts to support the pilgrims. He further appreciated the governor for providing necessary facilities at the Gombe airport worth more than N100 million to facilitate smooth airlift of pilgrims. Similarly, the Emir of Dukku, His Royal Highness, Haruna Rasheed, who is the Head of the government delegation to the holy land, lauded Yahaya for his support of Hajj operations and offering special interventions that make the operation easier for Gombe pilgrims.",
