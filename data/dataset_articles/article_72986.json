  "text": "Dear God, We pray for the unity of our nation. Heal the wounds of division and discord. Foster in us a spirit of reconciliation and mutual respect so that we may come together in our shared humanity to seek the well-being of all your children. Lord, in these times of uncertainty, help us to remember that our ultimate allegiance is to your Kin-dom. Fill our hearts with love, compassion and a relentless commitment to justice. Empower us to be peacemakers, bridge builders and advocates for truth. In Your infinite wisdom, guide our nation’s leaders. May they govern with righteousness and compassion. Grant them the courage to seek the common good over partisan interests, and the discernment to make decisions that foster peace and justice for all. May they be compassionate toward the vulnerable and the marginalized, working tirelessly to ensure that every voice is heard and valued. Lord, as we enter this election season, we lift our nation to you. We pray for every citizen, every candidate and every public servant. We ask for your protection over our democratic processes and institutions. May they reflect integrity, transparency and fairness, honoring the dignity and worth of every individual created in your image. As we navigate through these tumultuous times, we are reminded of the sacred duty you have entrusted to us — to do justice, to love kindness and to walk humbly with you, our God. May we strive to be your justice seekers and peacemakers in our church sanctuaries and civic duties. In the name of Jesus Christ, who is our peace and our hope, we pray. Amen. Rev. Bronwen Boswell Acting Stated Clerk of the General Assembly Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)",
