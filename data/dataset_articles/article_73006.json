  "text": "News By Tag Industry News News By Location Country(s) |Sa||Fr||Th||We||Tu||Mo||Su| Four Keys to Receiving More from God Miracles of Jesus: God's Goodness for Our Gain and His Glory By: Christ's Church at Moore Square First, we need to believe that God is good. Jesus says he came that we might have abundance (John 10:10). God wants us to grow, succeed, and prosper (Genesis 1:28). The servant with one talent believed God to be hard-hearted — a taker rather than a giver. \"I knew that you are a hard man, so I was afraid. Here is what belongs to you.\" Matthew 25:14-30 Fear and the expectation of working for nothing caused this man to do nothing. But God wants us to grow and prosper, not rest and rust. Read, receive, believe, and live by the verses found at the end of this press release. Next, we need to acknowledge that we have received a gift from God. The first two servants knew who gave them the talents. The third servant knew who gave the talent but he never acknowledged that it was his to use. Many do not accept their gifts, look for gifts, or expect to receive gifts from God. Third, we need to use the gifts we've been given. The first two servants used their talents and gained more. The lazy, wicked servant did nothing and lost his. The phrase, \"Use it or lose it.\" is a kingdom of God principle. Finally, we need to give thanks for what receive. When Jesus fed the 5000 and later the 7000 he gave thanks for all He received (a few fish and some bread). When we thank God for the small and large, we can be sure our attitude of gratitude will lead to growth Trust God for your provision. God does miracles with whatever we receive, big or small. Miraculous multiplication follows when we acknowledge the gifts we've received, use them for the good of others, trust God for increase, and thank Him in advance for the manifestation. When we do this our capacity will grow, and we will see God's provision in our life. Growth: James 4:10, Proverbs 3:1-2, 2 Timothy 3:17, John 15:10-12, 8, 14:15, Luke 2:49, Isaiah 41:10 Success: 1 Kings 2:3, Philippians 4:13, Joshua 1:5, 7-8, 1 Chronicles 22:13 Prosperity: Psalm 37:4, 7, 16, 25-26, 68:19, 84:11, 92:12-15, 112:1-9, 115:11-16, 122:6-7, 132:12-18, 145:8-9, Proverbs 3:9-10, 8:17-21, 10:2-6, 11:25, 13:4, 19:17, 28:13, 25, 27, Ecclesiastes 5:19, Isaiah 1:19, 58:10-11, Jeremiah 17:7-8, 29:11, Malachi 3:10-12, Acts 14:17, Galatians 6:6-10, Philippians 4:19, Titus 3:8, Hebrews 7:19-22, 11:6, James 1:17, 3 John 2 |Source||:||Christ's Church at Moore Square| |:| |Trending| | | |Most Viewed| | | |Daily News| | | |Most Viewed| | | |Daily News| | |",
