Escucha sin anuncios y sin esperas con iVoox Premium Six years after The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced in 2018 that it was working to create a new hymnbook for members to use as part of their worship and gospel study, leaders have released the first batch of hymns in four languages: English, Spanish, Portuguese and French. On this episode of the Church News podcast, Elder Isaac K. Morrison, a General Authority Seventy; Primary General President Susan H. Porter; and Hymnbook Committee Secretary Brooke Hirst talk about this sacred ongoing project. They are joined by guest host Church News Editor Ryan Jensen, who leads a discussion about the 13 new hymns released on Thursday, May 30, 2024. They discuss how sacred music helps members better worship Heavenly Father and the Savior Jesus Christ. The Church News Podcast is a weekly podcast that invites listeners to make a journey of connection with members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints across the globe. Host Sarah Jane Weaver, reporter and executive editor for The Church News for a quarter-century, shares a unique view of the stories, events, and most important people who form this international faith. With each episode, listeners are asked to embark on a journey to learn from one another and ponder, “What do I know now?” because of the experience. Produced by KellieAnn Halvorsen.",
