  "text": "[Walk the Talk Show with Waylon Lewis](https://elephantjournal.union.site/about/) presents: “Every Monday, I offer a little mindful reminder for our everyday life.” ~ Waylon Lewis In this week’s Mindful Monday video & podcast, Waylon shares a simple Buddhist practice that you can do anywhere, anytime. “ One of the most wonderful Buddhist instructions for how to become present and available, open, joyful, and genuine, in your life is as simple as this: any time of the day, particularly if you’re having a hard time, if you’re feeling speedy, if you’re feeling exhausted, look out your window. Go outside if you can. Then…” ~ Waylon Lewis Your Mindful Monday Video. “The instruction is as simple as just saying, look at your world. Look at your life.
