  "text": "Heptathlete Anna Hall Trusts God Amid Setbacks, Successes: ‘Stay Faithful’\nBy Movieguide® Contributor\nUSA heptathlete Anna Hall clings to her faith amid setbacks and successes.\n“The year that I transferred, I actually fell at Olympic trials in 2021,” Hall\nsaid on the “Sports Spectrum” podcast. “I was like I had an outside shot to make the team. I was really young, but that was like crushing, and I like could not understand, like, what was happening. My coach left the school I was at. I transferred. It was just like so much going on.”\n“I think my faith is what brought me through, and I just like grew stronger in my faith through that and knowing that there was a plan for later and then was able to bounce back from that injury incredibly well coming into the next year and doing really well at Worlds and that surprise first bronze medal,” she\ncontinued. “I feel like that ended up being kind of just a visual I use for the rest of my life. When something goes wrong, there’s something better coming if you just stay faithful.”\n“To me, [Jesus] is my Lord and Savior,” she declared. “Jesus is the reason that we’re here and that we’re able to have hope and that affects all aspects of my life.”\nAs Hall has grown more in her faith, she has also become more unashamed and often shares Bible verses on her social media.\nAs she faced another injury a few months ago, Hall\nwrote, “Comebacks suck. But they are always worth it. As difficult as it was I’m thankful to be out there competing again, and now have 10 weeks to chase progress. I’m fighting hard. Thanks for the kind messages, I feel them all.”\nShe also shared Isaiah 43:2, which\nreads, “When you go through deep waters, I will be with you. When you go through rivers of difficulty, you will not drown. When you walk through the fire of oppression, you will not be burned up; the flames will not consume you.”\nShe’s also hoping to make the 2024 Olympic team. Sports Spectrum\nreported, “Hall will compete at the 2024 U.S. Track and Field Olympic Trials on June 23-24 to earn her berth to represent the United States at the Paris Games (July 26-Aug. 11).”\nFor more inspiring sports stories, check out\nSports Spectrum.\nMovieguide® previously\nhttps://www.movieguide.org/news-articles/heptathlete-anna-hall-trusts-god-amid-2024-olympics-prep.html on Hall:\nHeptathlete Anna Hall keeps her focus on God amid losses and injuries as she looks ahead to the 2024 Paris Olympics.\nHall landed a silver medal at the World Championships last week in Budapest, leaving her disappointed and grateful.\nAfter the race, Hall\n[expressed], “I went for it. Very bittersweet. I really wanted gold and I just fought my heart out and it just wasn’t there this year for me. Kat was just better today, and I got beat.”\nHall shared on X, “It’s possible to be heartbroken and thankful at the same time. I love this sport. Thanks for all the love xx.”\nShare:",
