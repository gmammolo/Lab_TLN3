  "text": "RHMI Bermuda To Host Prayer Vigil On June 8 Restoration House Ministries International [RHMI] Bermuda will host its 8th Annual 24-Hour Prayer Vigil on June 8th. A spokesperson said, “On Saturday, June 8th, 2024, the Restoration House Ministries International Bermuda [RHMI Bda] will host the 8th Annual 24-Hour Prayer Vigil for the island of Bermuda and her people. From 12:01 am midnight on June 8th to 11:59 pm on June 8th intercessors will join in prayer and praise for our island both in person at the St Monica Mission’s Hall located at Glebe Road and virtually via Zoom. “The 24-Hour Prayer Community Global Prayer Room has been led by Min. Dr. Eugenia Robinson-Lobban, of RHMI Bda since 2016. This year’s 24-hour vigil will include intercessory prayer, preaching, teaching, and meditative ministry presentations such as vocal and instrumental music, liturgical dance, and visual art ministry. Each aspect of ministry is designed to draw individuals into the presence of God as prayer concerns are lifted from individuals and organizations throughout the island of Bermuda and beyond. “The 24 hour PrayerVigil was held for the first few years at The Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity Hall. It originally consisted of Prayer Stations that represented specific prayer points that were to be covered. There were folders on each station that held specific prayer requests that had been submitted by individuals and organizations outlining their needs. There was also a large map of Bermuda at one station and pictures of each parish at another where persons could intercede on behalf of each parish. “The 24-Hour Prayer experience has evolved to include the virtual component which allowed it to continue throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and broadened its reach to include the participation of persons from around the world. This has been an opportunity to include Bermudians who are ministering in other parts of the world and a platform to share a glimpse of the inner workings of each endeavor. One of the highlights in recent years has been the singing of the children from in the Philippines led by Evangelist Claire Warner of Bermuda. Other interesting expressions have been a meditative visual art session by Mrs. Rhona Pedro, a Couple’s Focus led by Steven and Carolla Lowe in the UK, Grief Focus led by Dr. Gina Spence Virgil and many others. “Persons are encouraged to sign-up to be a part of this major event in the Bermuda faith community by going online to www.eugenialrobinson.com or https://signup.com/client/invitation2/secure/233377902092/false#/invitation.
