  "text": "Now in this election season, there&#039;s been so much talk of Hindu Muslim polarization and divide, so we thought we&#039;d bring you a good news today&#039;s story, a story that shows what really communal harmony is, what interfaith dialogue can achieve in India. Our story comes from a village in Tamil Nadu which has set a real example of communal harmony. The Muslim community there donated land to build a temple after the Hindus there could not get an ideal location. What we will see in this story is an example of what makes India still such a very special place where Hindus and Muslims do live in coexistence. The politician may well try and divide us. The people, I believe, are bigger with their hearts and minds than the politicians can imagine. Uttapalayam village in Tirupur in Tamil Nadu has got a new Ganapati temple and it is built on three cents of land worth ₹6,00,000 donated by the Muslim community I Nearly nearly 300 families live in the village, which already had a mosque.

That is when the RMJ Rose Garden Muslim Jamaat stepped in Pongal and the Islamic On the day of temple opening, Muslims from the village took out a procession and made offerings to the shrine. They also shared meals with the devotees. Pure Report. India Today.",
