  "text": "A delegation of esteemed Sri Lankan Buddhist leaders, headed by Sri Lankan Minister for Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs, Honorable Vidura Wickramanayake, convened with Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Faisal Karimkundi, at the Governor’s House in Peshawar on Friday. The meeting was part of their visit to Pakistan to participate in the symposium and exhibition titled “Gandhara to the World,” organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During their visit, the delegation had the opportunity to explore the historic Governor House in Peshawar, immersing themselves in the rich heritage of the region. Governor Karimkundi took the opportunity to enlighten the Sri Lankan Minister and the Buddhist delegation about the deep-rooted history and cultural significance of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, particularly highlighting its ancient Buddhist heritage. Emphasizing the province’s commitment to preserving this legacy, Governor Karimkundi discussed efforts to promote tourism between Pakistan and Sri Lanka, citing the region’s allure to Buddhist religious leaders from around the world. “The historical and cultural heritage of Buddhism in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been meticulously safeguarded,” Governor Karimkundi affirmed. “Every year, Buddhist religious leaders from various countries visit the northern regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, drawn by the allure of our preserved Gandhara art and culture.” Expressing gratitude for the warm reception and the province’s dedication to preserving Buddhist heritage, the delegation conveyed their appreciation to Governor Karimkundi. The meeting underscored the strong cultural ties between Pakistan and Sri Lanka, as well as the mutual commitment to preserving and promoting the shared Buddhist heritage, exemplified by the “Gandhara to the World” initiative.",
