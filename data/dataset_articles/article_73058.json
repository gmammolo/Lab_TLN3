  "text": "Muhammadu Sanusi II was deposed in March 2020 by the immediate past governor of Kano State, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje. The Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II has stated that there is no one who can question the actions of God over his reinstatement. Muhammadu Sanusi II was deposed in March 2020 by the immediate past governor of Kano State, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje. Last week, Governor Abba Yusuf of Kano State reinstated Sanusi while dethroning Aminu Ado Bayero. Sanusi’s reinstatement followed the passage of a new law by the State House of Assembly which abolished four emirates created in addition to the Emir of Kano. The emirates were created under a controversial law in 2019 by the administration of former Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. However, the former Central Bank of Nigeria CBN governor while speaking during the Friday prayers at the Kofar Kudu Central Mosque in Kano, said people should understand that whatever happens is predestined by God. He then urged people to focus on the deeds of Allah during good and bad times, according to Daily Post. He said; “Whoever believes that Allah alone gives everything must take the decision of Allah wholeheartedly. No one asks Allah’s reasons for anything. “We were told that whoever did not accept destiny is from Allah, his belief is not complete. One should be thankful in times of good and bad situations. We must believe that whatever happens to us is predestined from God and what we couldn’t have is from Him. “We are fast approaching Zhul Hijja which is very beneficial and we must observe supplications these days.”",
