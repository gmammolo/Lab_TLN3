  "text": "Himachal: BJP President JP Nadda offers prayers at temple before casting his vote in Bilaspur The four Lok Sabha constituencies in Himachal Pradesh -- Kangra, Mandi, Hamirpur, and Shimla--are polling in a single phase on June 1. [ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 01-06-2024 10:14 IST | Created: 01-06-2024 10:14 IST - Country: - India Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda along with his wife Mallika Nadda offered prayers at a temple near his residence, in Himachal Pradesh's Bilaspur on Saturday, ahead of casting their votes in the seventh phase of Lok Sabha elections. Nadda was also spotted feeding cows at a cowshed in Bilaspur ahead of exercising his franchise. The four Lok Sabha constituencies in Himachal Pradesh -- Kangra, Mandi, Hamirpur, and Shimla--are polling in a single phase on June 1. In addition to the Lok Sabha elections, by-polls are also being held in six Himachal Pradesh assembly seats on the same day. These seats fell vacant after the disqualification of rebel Congress MLAs. The by-poll results are crucial for the future of the Sukhvinder Sukhu government in the state, which received a jolt after the Congress Rajya Sabha candidate, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, lost against BJP's Harsh Mahajan despite the former party having more MLAs in the state. The seventh and final phase of polling in the largest festival of democracy started on Saturday as voting started in the last 57 parliamentary constituencies at 7 am across seven states and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. The seventh phase marks a grand finish to the world's largest polling marathon that began on the 19th of last month and has already covered six phases and 486 Lok Sabha seats. According to the Election Commission of India, over 10.06 crore electors including approximately 5.24 crore male, 4.82 crore female and 3574 third gender electors are expected to exercise their franchise.
