  "text": "The Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, has said no one can ask God for explanation on any issue.\nThe monarch said this in his sermon at the Kofar Kudu Central Mosque in Kano, where he led the Juma’at prayer.\nThe sermon focused on belief in Allah, importance of patience and the need to accept destiny as one of the articles of faith.\n“Whoever believes that Allah alone gives everything must take his decision wholeheartedly. No one asks Allah’s reasons for anything.\nKano Emirate: Path for peaceful coexistence 36 states should be scrapped- Promoter of regionalism “We were told that whoever does not accept that destiny is from Allah, his belief is not complete. One should be thankful in good and bad situations. We must believe that whatever happens to us is predestined and what we couldn’t have is also from God.\n“We are fast approaching Zhul Hijja, which is very beneficial; and we must observe supplications these days.”\nThe monarch subsequently led prayers and later went back to the palace.\nMeanwhile, the 15th Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero also observed his Friday prayer at the Nasarawa mini palace, alongside teeming supporters and followers.\nEarlier, the Kano State police command had dismissed reports that Ado Bayero would lead Jumma’t prayers at Kofar Kudu Central Mosque, Kano, where Mir Muhammadu Sanusi is at the moment.\nBoth Sanusi and Ado Bayero have been laying claim to the throne, creating confusion in the city.\nGovernor Abba Kabir Yusuf had dethroned Ado Bayero and asked him to hand over within 48 hours. But the dethroned monarch returned to the town under military protection and has been operating from the mini palace since then.\n5 conflicting court orders served – CP Gumel\nMeanwhile, the commissioner of police, Kano State command, Usaini Gumel, said five conflicting court orders were served concerning the emirate tussle.\nAt an emergency meeting with media executives at the police headquarters on Friday, CP Gumel said the orders had been forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation for legal advice and interpretation, noting that as a law-abiding institution, the police have no right to interpret them.\nGumel also sought the cooperation of media practitioners in the maintenance of peace, law and order in Kano while the tussle lasts.\nThe CP advised journalists to be very careful and professional in their reportage to avoid a breakdown of law and order.",
