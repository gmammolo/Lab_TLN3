Rajinikanth also elaborated on the importance of spirituality in today&#039;s world. He stated, &quot;The whole world needs spirituality, as it&#039;s important for every human being. Being spiritual means experiencing peace and tranquillity, and fundamentally, it involves believing in God.&quot; In addition to his visits to Kedarnath and Badrinath, Rajinikanth recently sought blessings at the BAPS Hindu Mandir in Abu Dhabi.
