  "text": "Fast traveling in Fallout 76 is a quick and easy way to travel from one location in Appalachia to another for reasons like completing quests or public events. To fast travel in Fallout 76, you must have previously discovered the location you want to fast travel to on foot. Then, you can open your map, select it, and confirm that you wish to travel to it. You'll know if it is a free location or if it will cost you caps because it will confirm that you want to spend Caps to travel. Here are all free fast travel locations in Fallout 76 so you can fast travel around Appalachia with no Caps in your stash. [Related ](/fallout-76-frog-habitat-location/) [ Fallout 76: Where To Get The Frog Habitat ](/fallout-76-frog-habitat-location/) Here's where to get the Frog Habitat in Fallout 76 so you can earn the Herpetologist Pioneer Scouts badge. All Free Fast Travel Locations in Fallout 76 You can travel to the locations below in Fallout 76 for free. These locations will cover most regions in Appalachia and are a great way to discover additional locations on foot to fill out your map by adding new locations. Here are the nine free fast travel points in Fallout 76: - C.A.M.P. (Yours, friends, or team members) - Fort Atlas (Savage Divide) - Foundation (Savage Divide) - Survival Tent (Requires Fallout 1st to Place) - The Crater (Toxic Valley) - The Rusty Pick (Ash Heap) - The Rose Room (Savage Divide) - The Whitespring Resort (Savage Divide) - Vault 76 (The Forest) C.A.M.P. C.A.M.P.S. (Construction and Assembly Mobile Platform) are homes you can deploy to most places in Appalachia. You can travel to your own C.A.M.P. or those belonging to your friends and teammates. You can have multiple camps, though only one active at a time, making it perfect to have bases all around Appalachia based on what quests or [apparel farming](https://gamerant.com/fallout-76-red-asylum-dress-location/) you are currently doing. Fort Atlas Fort Atlas is located in the Savage Divide region and is home to the Brotherhood of Steel in the old Atlas Observatory. As a fun fact if you call a nuke to this location the inhabitants outside will wear hazmat suits, but will all be killed (not Russell Dorsey). Foundation The Foundation is located in the Savage Divide region and is home to the [Settlers faction](https://gamerant.com/fallout-76-raid-vault-79-with-raiders-or-settlers/). This settlement was founded in 2103 at the site of the old Spruce Knob public workshop building. The Foundation is one of the locations where Minerva sells her goods, like the [Chemist Backpack Mod](/fallout-76-chemist-backpack-mod-location/). Survival Tent The Survival Tent in Fallout 76 is a movable camp only placeable by those with a [Fallout 1st subscription](https://gamerant.com/fallout-76-1st-subscription-worth-good-bad-benefits-stash-worlds-scoreboard/). However, you can travel to your Survival Tent or those that belong to your friends or teammates. All other players can use your Survival Tent should they find it while traveling on foot. The Survival Tent is perfect for placing in areas that don't have a free, fast travel point nearby. The Crater The Crater is a Raider foundation built from a crashed space station, the Valiant-1, after the year 2103. YOu can choose to spawn inside The Crater if you have business inside or on the outside if you are using it to travel to another location. Minerva also shows up at the Crater to sell her wares, like the [Unstoppable Monster](https://gamerant.com/fallout-76-how-to-get-find-unstoppable-monster-weapon-melee/). Tommy Ten-Toes also had The Crater in his rotation. The Rose Room You'll find the Rose Room in the Savage Divide region. It became the newest free fast travel point in Fallout 76 when Bethesda released it during part two of the [Atlantic City expedition](https://gamerant.com/fallout-76-how-to-get-to-atlantic-city/) update called America's Playground. You'll meet an interesting family called the Russos, who will start a quest for you to visit Atlantic City. There are slot machines you can play and various Atlantic City-themed items here, making it a fun spot to visit. The Rusty Pick The Rusty Pick is in the Ash Heap region north of Mount Blair. You'll find a legendary vendor named Purveyor Murmrgh, an exchange machine, and a U-Mine-It! Vending machine at this location. The Rusty Pick only appears in Fallout 76 and no other titles in the franchise. The Whitespring Resort The White Spring Resort, also called The Whitespring Refuge, is located in the Savage Divide Region and is home to the First Responders faction. To start expeditions for the first time, you'll need to complete a quest chain that begins here, and many vendors are selling a wide variety of goods here. Finally, a drinking fountain in a gazebo outside the main building will cure any disease if you are short on [Antibiotics](https://gamerant.com/fallout-76-antibiotics-recipe-location/) or Disease cure. Vault 76 Vault 76 is the starting location for new Vault Dwellers starting a new character in Fallout 76. It is located in the Forest Region and is a good starting point for new players. After leaving Vault 76 for the first time, the game will ask you to pick between [Battle Ready or Fresh Dweller](https://gamerant.com/fallout-76-should-you-pick-battle-ready-fresh-dweller/), which will dictate the level at which you leave the vault.",
