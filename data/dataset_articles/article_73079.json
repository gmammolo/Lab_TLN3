  "text": "Telugu Hanuman Jayanti celebrates the birth of Lord Hanuman in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It would be celebrated on Saturday, June 1, 2024. This festival will be celebrated with great devotion by a large number of devotees. Telugu Hanuman Jayanti is mainly celebrated in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It begins on Chaitra Purnima and continues until the Dashami Tithi of the Jyestha Month. Hanuman Jayanti 2024 Date and Timings: Hanuman Jayanti Saturday, June 1, 2024 Dashami Tithi Begins 07:24 AM, June 01, 2024 Dashami Tithi Ends 05:04 AM, June 02, 2024 Hanuman, born to Anjana and Kesari, both of whom were monkeys, has a divine origin story. Anjana, originally an apsara (celestial nymph) under a curse, was transformed into a monkey. She received a blessing from Lord Shiva that her son would be immortal, possess extraordinary strength, and be a fervent devotee of Lord Rama. Hanuman Jayanti Rituals Deeksha (Vow): On Chaitra Purnima, the full moon day of the Hindu lunar month of Chaitra, devotees commence a 41-day Deeksha. This vow encompasses practices such as fasting, prayers, and self-discipline. Puja Rituals: Preparation: Devotees purify their homes, make early visits to temples, partake in a sacred bath, and don clean attire. Altar setup: They prepare an altar with Lord Hanuman's image or idol, embellishing it with flowers, garlands, and offerings like fruits, sweets, and betel leaves. Prayers and mantras: The Hanuman Chalisa, a 40-verse ode in honor of Hanuman, is recited, along with other mantras dedicated to him. Offering food: Devotees prepare special dishes such as laddus and other sweets to offer to Hanuman as prasad, which is later distributed among family and friends. Aarti: The puja culminates with an aarti, involving the lighting of a lamp and its rotation around the deity accompanied by hymns, signifying the dispelling of darkness and the ushering in of enlightenment and wisdom. Fasting: Many followers fast from dawn to dusk, breaking it only after the evening prayers are concluded. Hanuman Jayanti Significance According to Hindu beliefs, Hanuman Ji is one of the Chiranjeevis, immortal beings who are still present on Earth. He is deeply devoted to Lord Sri Rama and is known for his unwavering loyalty and strength. Lord Hanuman, also known as Bajrangbali, Maruti Nandan, and Sankat Mochan, holds a special place in Hindu mythology. His parents are Mother Anjani and King Kesari. Some consider him to be an incarnation of Lord Shiva (Rudravtar). &nbsp;\",",
