  "text": "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. – John 3:16-17 In our world, people live according to their financial status. Those who have wealth enjoy the best of life. They live in beautiful homes, drive fancy and expensive cars, travel first class or in their own special aircraft. They eat in the most expensive restaurants and afford themselves the most luxurious pleasures of life. Then there are those who are not so wealthy, but they also live well. Their homes are comfortable, and their automobiles are upscale. They, too, can travel around the world because they have the means. There are those who do not have the means to live well or in very comfortable homes. They drive used automobiles if they can afford one. They travel and take vacation by means of credit. Eating out is done in less expensive restaurants. Even though, according to human standards, these groups are noticeably different, in the eyes of God they are the same. God does not see class structure, or economic difference. To him, they are all the same. They all live in a world of sin and woe and are perishing. They all need a savior. That is why God, out of pure love, sent his beloved son into the world to die for us, that we do not perish. The above text emphasizes that God loves us unconditionally. He has demonstrated His love through the person and work of the Son, Jesus the Christ. When we are brought into the kingdom through the power of the Holy Spirit, we have a change of heart. We come to love God as our father. The Holy Spirit gives us a spiritual birth. The father sent the Son, who died for us. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit all work for the common goal of saving us from our sins and granting us eternal life. When we are reborn by God through faith, we become God’s children. We receive his blessing through Christ’s work on the cross. God’s love is in our salvation which comes through Jesus Christ the son. God the father sacrificed his son for us. The love of God is without bounds. It is the greatest love we humans have ever experienced. There is no question about God’s love for us. The promise of eternal life is real and unmistakable. Those who search for God will realize that God cared enough to send the very best, His own son to make our salvation possible and complete. God’s unlimited offer of salvation is seen in the above text. God wishes to reform our lives, give us direction, lead us in the way of salvation and remind us often of the forgiveness of our sins and eternal life. He won that for us through his unconditional love which is found in the bruises and scars of his beloved son. God is the author of love and mercy. His storehouse never runs out. Amen. - Reverend Samuel M. Boodle, pastor at the Lutheran Church of Nassau, 119 John F. Kennedy Drive, can be reached at P.O.
