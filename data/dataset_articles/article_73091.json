  "text": "(Jesus said) “Let the children come to me, do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.” Mark 10:14,15 RSV\nI grew up, not in New York City itself but in a semi-rural area just north. In those long-past days there were small farms, lots of wooded areas where we played our endless games, schools we walked to every day.\nTo get into the city, we took the train. My father rode it every day to work; we did the same for our big city adventures. I loved getting dressed up (white gloves, pretty dress, Sunday shoes), riding into Grand Central Station with its crowds of bustling people, the famous gilded clock in the center where everyone met and the beautiful painted ceiling vaulting high above our heads. We’d take a cab to 5th Avenue and the big department stores — Lord and Taylor’s, Bloomingdale’s — and spend the day riding elevators run by white gloved-attendants who announced the contents of each floor, waited on by patient women who brought us clothes to try on.\nBut there was the time I lost Mom. I probably got bored, as kids will, and wandered off while she leafed through racks of dresses. Suddenly, I realized I was alone, a little person drowning in a sea of unfamiliar faces. The adventure wasn’t fun anymore. I still remember the wave of panic which washed over me… and, eighty years later, the smell of Mom’s furry coat, the silky feel of it against my face, my utter relief and joy when she found me.\nI didn’t ask where she’d been or what her plan was for the rest of our day. I didn’t worry about finding a taxi to get us back to Grand Central in time for the train home. I didn’t even concern myself about whether she had bought all she had been looking for on that long ago day.\nAll I knew was that Mom was with me. She loved me and her plans were good. I could relax and trust her. Everything would be okay.\nGod wants us to approach Him, Jesus says, like that: a child with a beloved parent. We don’t have to figure Him out or decipher the future. We know He is with us, He loves us and His plans for us are good.\nWe can relax and trust Him. Everything will be okay.\nFATHER GOD: Help me to trust You like a child, to know You love me and Your plan is good.\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters",
