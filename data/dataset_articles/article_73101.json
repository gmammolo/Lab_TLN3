  "text": "Bhadrakali Jayanti – 02 June 2024 [Bhadrakali Jayanti](https://www.prokerala.com/festivals/bhadrakali-jayanti.html) commemorates the birth anniversary of Goddess Bhadrakali. It is celebrated on the Ekadashi [Tithi](https://www.prokerala.com/astrology/tithi/) of the Krishna paksha in the [Jyeshta month](https://www.prokerala.com/general/calendar/hinducalendar.php?year=2024&mon=june&sb=1#calendar) of the Hindu calendar. Worshipping the goddess on this day is believed to remove all the obstacles in one's life. Some states of India celebrate this day as Apara Ekadashi while in Orissa, it is observed as Jalakrida Ekadashi. This year, the festival falls on June 2nd. On the day of Bhadrakali Jayanti, the sunrise is anticipated to be at 05:44 AM and sunset at 07:05 PM. The Ekadashi tithi commences at 05:05 AM on the 2nd and concludes at 02:41 AM on the following day. Goddess Bhadrakali is believed to have appeared from the hairs of God Shiva on this day. The reason behind her incarnation was to rid the Earth of all evils and demons. This day is celebrated with great enthusiasm throughout the country, particularly in the states of Haryana, Kashmir, and Himachal. It's also one of the most important festivals of the Aryan Saraswat Brahmins. Devotees celebrate the day worshipping Goddess Bhadrakali with full devotion and dedication. Wearing the colours black or blue on the day is believed to be auspicious. Idols of the Goddess are given a Panchamrita Abhishek, followed by performing the Chandan Puja and Bilva Puja. Several pujas and rituals are conducted in the temples of Goddess Bhadrakali, which begin at noon time. On the day visiting temples during the evening time is considered auspicious. May Goddess Bhadrakali bless all devotees with happiness and prosperity. Happy Bhadrakali Jayanti to everyone celebrating!",
