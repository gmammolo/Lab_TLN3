  "text": "Sing HU to Reach a Higher State of Consciousness Are you looking for a way to help calm the mind and get a higher perspective in daily life? HU is an ancient name for God. When sung or chanted with love, it opens the lines of communication to the most sacred part of yourself. It acts like a tuning fork, aligning Soul with higher states of love, creativity, healing and awareness. This sacred word can spiritually uplift people of any religion, culture, or walk of life. “If you want to lift yourself to a higher state of consciousness—so that the political issues, the family issues, the social issues of the day do not throw you out of balance, so that you can find a happier, more contented life while you’re living here—sing HU, the most beautiful prayer.” —Harold Klemp, The Sound Of Soul , p. 33 Chanting HU is a way to bring: Expanded awareness A release of fears Answers and inner guidance A subtle sense of divine love The Sound of Soul is a public event for those who want to experience the uplifting sound of HU and the benefits that come from it. Listen to a heart-opening spiritual quotation. Experience a 15-minute HU Chant and quiet contemplation. Share your spiritual experiences or ask questions in a relaxed, spiritual conversation. This special in-person event is open to everyone—invite your family and friends!
