  "text": "1930 – 2024\nBorn in 1930 in Choiceland, Saskatchewan, Roy was a man of great generosity and kindness. Above all, his life was defined by his faith in Christ, which led him to live a life of integrity and generosity.\nAlthough Roy left school after grade eight, he had a keen mind and unique ability to fix or engineer solutions to repair or build just about anything. He was a problem solver extraordinaire.\nSome of his fondest memories were of his younger days, working as a logger and high rigging on the BC coast. In his downtime, he would race to see how quickly he could climb a 100-foot spar tree in his spikes, or he would water ski from Thetis Island to Chemainus on his homemade skis. He loved to tell the story of a cold Christmas day, when he skied past a number of yachts anchored near Thetis Island, just for entertainment. Unfortunately, his life was forever changed when he was hit by a drunk driver. And although he couldn't do all of the things he used to do, he continued to enjoy the outdoors and to be as active as his injuries allowed.\nRoy was proud of R.P. Richmond Industrial Contractors which he helped to create, and where he provided technical knowledge and problem solving into his 70s. The company and most importantly the people who worked there were always close to his heart.\nWe are very grateful for the excellent support and care that he received in his later years at The Maple Residences, and Fraserview Retirement Community. To those of you that took extra time to chat/listen, made sure that he had his 7 PM snacks, or got to go wheelchair bowling - we are immensely grateful.\nRoy is survived by his daughters, Ann (Sam) and Alexandra, and special family member Dave (Sue).\nRoy prioritized helping others, and the family asks that you do the same - reach out a helping hand to someone near you or donate to the charity of your choice. A celebration of life will be held in September, details as yet to be determined.\nPublished online June 1, 2024\nIn Memory of RoyWhen is the\n[ordering deadline?](javascript:void(0))\nIn Memory of RoyHow does\n[it work?](javascript:void(0))\nSend Flowers: When Is the Ordering Deadline?\nANY DAY OF THE WEEK\nOrder any time up till the day before\nMON-FRI Order by 2:00PM\nSAT & SUN Order by noon\nTUES-SAT\nOrder by 3:00PM\nThe day before\nSAT & SUN Order by Saturday\nNote: These are general guidelines; some florists may not be able to operate within these timelines.
