  "text": "PM Modi embarked on meditation on the evening of May 30 and he is scheduled to complete it on the evening of Saturday. A fresh video of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was released on Saturday as he embarked on his second and final day of meditation in Kanyakumari. Clad in saffron dhoti-kurta and a scarf, the PM was seen praying using his japa mala (prayer beads). During sunrise at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial, Modi also carried out ‘Surya Arghya,’ a ritual associated with spiritual practice involving salutations to the Almighty, manifested in the form of sun. The PM poured little water from a traditional, beaker-like small vessel into the sea as an offering (Arghya) and prayed using japa mala. Modi also paid floral tributes to a statue of Swami Vivekananda. He walked around the mandapam with his ‘japa mala‘ in his hands. Kanyakumari is famous for its sunrise and sunset and the memorial is located on a tiny islet near the shoreline. At the Vivekananda Rock Memorial, the PM embarked on meditation on the evening of May 30 and he is scheduled to complete it on the evening of Saturday.
