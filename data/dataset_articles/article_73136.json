He served as the Archbishop of Castries in the West Indies island nation of Saint Lucia from 1981 until his retirement in 2008. Pope Francis created him Cardinal in 2014. In a telegram sent on Saturday, Pope Francis said he was saddened to learn of the death of the Cardinal. He expressed his condolences to the clergy, religious, and lay faithful of the Archdiocese of Castries and the Church in the West Indies. “Recalling with deep gratitude the late Cardinal’s many years of dedicated episcopal ministry in Saint Lucia, especially his efforts in fostering the education of young people and his contribution to the Church throughout the Caribbean, I willingly join you in commending his soul to the love and mercy of our Heavenly Father,” wrote the Pope. Pope Francis also imparted his Apostolic Blessing upon all those who will participate in his funeral Mass.
