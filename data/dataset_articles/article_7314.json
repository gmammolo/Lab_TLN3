  "text": "A bush fire in a NSW South Coast national park has expanded to 91 hectares.\nSubscribe now for unlimited access.\nor signup to continue reading\nRural Fire Service public liaison officer Marty Webster told Bega District News crews were taking the fire very seriously and were throwing all the appropriate resources at it.\nThe fire was located north of Yowrie, south of Belowra, and approximately 20 kilometres north west of Cobargo in Wadbilliga National Park.\n\"The fire is burning in really challenging country, so it's hard to get good containment,\" Mr Webster said.\n\"The multi-agency response has slowed its progression in the challenging and hot conditions.\"\nMr Webster said crews would be battling the blaze throughout the night with the \"intent to keep it as small as possible\".\nHeavy machinery was deployed to prepare a number of contingency plans to give firefighters a range of options.\nOn the morning of Thursday, January 8, the multi-agency effort continued on the NSW South Coast as firefighters battled what was then a 19 hectare national park fire.\nFar South Coast RFS district coordinator Chris Anderson said the fire was burning in rugged remote and inaccessible terrain in Wadbilliga National Park.\n\"We've currently got aircraft up over the top of it actively water-bombing the fire\" Mr Anderson told Bega District News on Thursday, January 8.\n\"Firefighters from RFS, National Parks and Wildlife Service and Forestry Corporation are all actively on the ground at this fire.\n\"We're preparing for the next few days in case the fire does move out of there.\n\"But like I said, we've got approximately seven aircraft actively bombing this fire at the moment to keep it to the smaller size.\n\"We want people to keep up to date with this fire via RFS social media channels, the media, and the Hazards Near Me app.\"\nWhile the cause of the fire was still under investigation, Mr Anderson noted that there had been a lot of lightning over the region in the past few days.\n\"We just want people to be mindful that we had a significant amount of lightning over the weekend,\" he said.\n\"Fires from lightning can pop up days and days after the event.\n\"So just keep an eye on your properties.\"",
