  "text": "After three visits as a karsevak, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis visited the Ayodhya Ram Mandir for the first time after its construction, on Thursday. He said he was yearning to seek Ram Lallas blessings ever since the new temple came up early this year. I had been to Ayodhya thrice as a karsevak [during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement] and several times as a Ramsevak. But today my joy knows no bounds after seeking the blessings of Sri Ram, he said. I havent demanded anything from God because he knows everything, Fadnavis added. After three visits as a karsevak, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis visited the Ayodhya Ram Mandir for the first time after its construction on Thursday. He said he was yearning to seek Ram Lallas blessings ever since the new temple came up early this year. Fadnavis with the devotees from Maharashtra at the temple I had been to Ayodhya thrice as a karsevak (during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement) and several times as a Ramsevak. But today my joy knows no bounds after seeking the blessings of Sri Ram. I havent demanded anything from God because he knows everything, he said. Fadnavis said he didnt know if the Ram Mandir would be constructed in Ayodhya in the span of his lifetime. But thanks to Modi-ji for making it possible. The temple has been constructed and I got an opportunity to visit it. Were not Hindus only for the purpose of elections. Were Ramsevaks who follow Shri Ram, he added. Fadnavis met the temple construction workers and thanked them for their service. He also met a group of devotees from Maharashtra. Later, while noting down his remarks in the visitors book the temple trust maintains, the DCM thanked the people who had laid their lives during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Im fortunate to be here in the temple that has been reconstructed. Im fortunate to be a karsevak who served the movement. I pay tribute to those who laid their lives for the countrys resurrection through the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, he wrote. Earlier in the day, Fadnavis visited the Kashi Vishwanath and Hanuman Gadhi temples in Varanasi where he campaigned for PM Modi on Wednesday. Jan 22Day the Ram temple was consecrated",
