Bharat's great knowledge, was endangered by invaders and foreign ideas and common man was consumed by confusion and misleading knowledge about how to achieve their goals. Adi Shankaracharya taught pure Vedic wisdom that allows to achieve material and spiritual success. He was a traditionalist who did not dilute or misinterpret systems but was proud of his origin as a Devta Upasaka.\nOn this development, Anuradha ji said, \" Sanatan Dharma , is often misinterpreted. In reality, it encompasses a timeless and universal philosophy that promotes individual strength, harmony and an inclusive ecosystem. Its teachings emphasize the importance of inner peace, spiritual growth and the interconnectedness of all beings. By promoting these values, it seeks to create a world where diverse cultures can unite under a common platform of mutual respect and understanding. I am committed to taking this message of peace and unity to audiences around the world\".\nPaudwal's illustrious career spans over 50 years, during which she has received numerous accolades for her contributions to Indian music and spirituality.
