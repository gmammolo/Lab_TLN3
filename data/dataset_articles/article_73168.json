  "text": "On the first day of June, people of all nations are invited to observe Global Day of Parents by honoring parents and parental figures worldwide. Since 2012, this day has been designated to celebrate the commitment of parents to their children’s well-being. Entrusted with the responsibility to provide, protect and prepare their children for life, parents play a central role in a child’s development.\nAs the mother of two adult sons, I find myself amazed at how fast my children grew up. There are times when it seems like yesterday when I was walking with them to the bus stop, gathering art supplies for their school projects or watching them play baseball. Each stage of their development brought its share of joys and challenges.\nIt was not until I became a parent that I realized how much my own parents did for me. Though my mother and father have both passed away, I have fond memories of Dad teaching me how to ride a bike or Mom going on field trips with my class. I remember home-cooked meals, family vacations and birthday celebrations. Most of all, I remember that they instilled in me the importance of faith, family and education.\nIt is natural for most parents to parent their children the way they were parented. In some cases, parents may choose to do just the opposite of what their parents did. Overall, I imagine that every parent wants their children to be happy, healthy and well-adjusted. Parenting can be stressful at times, but without good role models, useful information or relational skills, parenting can be overwhelming.\nNo doubt parents face unique challenges rearing children in today’s fast-paced society. A 2024 State of Parenting Survey compiled by Littlebird Care, a digital health company, reported that “Safety remains paramount with 89.6% of parents concerned about their child’s well-being when out of sight.”\nIn addition, parents expressed concerns about bullying, peer pressure and mental health challenges. Faced with their own struggles with family/work balance, many parents reported financial stress and exhaustion. The rapid changes in technology have intensified concerns of the “countless risks and dangers online, including cyberbullying, exposure to inappropriate content, and identity theft.” Increased aggression in children, a sense of entitlement or diminished respect for others causes distress for parents and impacts society.\nIn her book, “Connecting with our Children,” Dr. Roberta Gilbert states, “Parents are the hope of civilization. Much depends on whether parents can connect in a meaningful positive way with each other and with their children. If they can, a generation may emerge ready to tackle and reverse some ominous trends.”\nGiven all that parents are up against in this day and age, observing Global Day of Parents provides an opportunity for each of us to encourage parents everywhere. Offering a kind word, listening to their concerns or showing patience and understanding can mean so much to a struggling parent. Too often parents experience judgement, criticism and competition from others instead of support, encouragement and understanding. As neighbors, friends and family, we have the opportunity to be a resource to other parents rather than a stressor.\nMinistering to parents and families is a profound opportunity for the faith community. Dr. Lisa Miller, author of “The Spiritual Child,” did significant research at Columbia University on the role of spirituality in the lives of children. Her research demonstrated that spiritual experiences can help children navigate peer pressure, deal with crises, and avoid alcohol and drugs.\nMiller writes, “The essential developmental support that parents are uniquely positioned to provide includes early exposure, awareness, and cultivation of our spiritual assets, time and space, and spiritual social context.” When congregations strengthen and support parents in their efforts to nurture and guide their children, they truly give hope for generations to come.\nIn whatever way you choose to celebrate Global Day of Parents, I hope you will take the time to recognize the parents you encounter throughout your day. Whether your own parents, your neighbors or parents in your congregation, offer a word of gratitude, encouragement or support. Let them know you have confidence in them as they do the best they can to parent their children each and every day.\nThe Rev.
