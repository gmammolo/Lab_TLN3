According to Local 18 Tamil Nadu, on May 31, Undiyal Money counting took place in this temple. The temple administration collected money from the devotees amounting to crores. Due to the summer vacation, the footfall recorded in the temple was more in comparison to last month. Due to the enormous donations received from the believers, the coffers of Ramanathaswamy temple were filled in a short time. The task of counting the money received in the name of the temple was held in its east tower hall. The temple staff and volunteers from Salem and Thanjavur were also present during the counting of money. Post the counting, they informed the public that Rs 1,35,11,800, 77 grams and 500 milligrams of gold have been collected. In addition to these donations, 4 Kg and 105 g of silver and foreign currency have also been collected by the temple administration. This temple is believed to be the virtuous place for the humans to get rid of their sins. It is also considered a holy pilgrimage site for Shaivites, Vaishnavites and Smarthas. A massive number of devotees from different parts of the country arrive at this temple to pay their respects to the deities present here. They also look forward to the darshan of Ambal statue.
