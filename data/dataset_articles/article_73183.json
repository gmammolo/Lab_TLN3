  "text": "Cairo: An innovative guidance system is in place at Islam's holiest site ahead of this month's annual Hajj pilgrimage. The Saudi General Authority for Care and Management of the Two Holiest Mosques has installed the GPS-based system using digital interactive maps and the \"Makkani (My Place) app at the Grand Mosque, Islam's most sacred place in the city of Mecca. The system aims to give the pilgrims and worshippers easy access to the sprawling place and its landmarks including the Mataf (circumambulation) courtyard where the Holy Kaaba is located. The interactive maps help worshippers reach a multitude of facilities at the mosque, including its different gates, library, bathrooms, guidance offices, cart service, escalators, and field hospitals. The maps are available in several languages including Arabic, English, French Urdu, Indonesian and Turkish. Additionally, 200 QR code boards are spread across the mosque, enabling the worshipper to specify his/her actual location and the targeted destination via the mobile operating systems iOS and Android, according to the Saudi news agency SPA. More than 2 million Muslims from all over the world are expected to attend the upcoming pilgrimage anticipated to begin on June 14. More than 500,000 overseas pilgrims have already arrived in Saudi Arabia, according to official figures. Hajj is one of Islam’s five obligatory duties. Muslims, who can physically and financially afford Hajj, have to perform it at least once in a lifetime.",
