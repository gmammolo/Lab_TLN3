  "text": "States » SouthPosted at: Jun 1 2024 6:54PM TN: PM Modi concludes 45-hour long meditation at Vivekananda Rock MemorialKanyakumari (Tamil Nadu), Jun 1 (UNI) Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday concluded his 45-hour long meditation session at the iconic Vivekananda Rock Memorial off Kanyakumari coast, ahead of the 18th Lok Sabha election results.Modi, who embarked on a three-day spiritual tour to Tamil Nadu, after concluding his election campaign in Punjab’s Hoshiarpur for the seventh and final phase of the Parliamentary election, commenced his meditation at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial on Thursday evening.After ending the meditation, he took a group photo with the staff of Vivekananda Kendra at the memorial.Modi then visited the 41-metre tall statue of Tamil saint-poet Thiruvalluvar located on a huge rock near the Vivekananda Rock Memorial and paid floral tributes.Later, the Prime Minister left for Thiruvananthapuram.Earlier, he offered special prayers at the historic Sri Bhagavathi Amman Temple, one of the “108 Shakthi Peedams” at Kanyakumari on May 30 evening and sailed to the Vivekananda Rock Memorial at mid-sea where he commenced the meditation session at the Dhyana Mandapam amid a blanket security cover.The PM, clad in Saffron shirt, shawl and dhoti performed “Surya Arghya,” a religious practice in Hinduism offering water to Lord Surya (Sun) and prayed to the Sun god with folded hands on the second day of the meditation session.The BJP on its “X: handle, (formerly Twitter) released a video and different photos of Modi performing Surya Arghya and then meditating at the memorial holding the prayer beads.It was believed that Swami Vivekananda meditated for three days and nights on the rock until he attained “Enlightenment.”The opposition parties, including the Congress, DMK, Trinamool Congress, CPI, CPI(M) and AAP strongly objected to the meditation session of the Prime Minister terming it as a poll ploy and violate the Model Code of Conduct.Modi, who completed a second term and vying for a third consecutive term, held around 206 election campaign events, including rallies and roadshows in 75 days across the country.It may be recalled that the PM had visited Shivaji’s Pratapgarh in 2014 and meditated in a holy cave near the Kedarnath shrine in Uttarakhand in May 2019 after the polling concluded for the 16th and 17th Lok Sabha elections, respectively.UNI GSM CS1855Tags: #TN: PM Modi concludes 45-hour long meditation at Vivekananda Rock Memorial",
