  "text": "Joseph Montalvo continued a recent mastery of South Atlantic League hitters on Friday night, as he led the Hickory Crawdads to a 4-1 in over the Winston-Salem Dash. On Friday, Montalvo allowed just three hits and a walk over five shutout innings and struck out three. The start wrapped up a stellar month for the native of Bayamon, Puerto Rico. Over his five starts in May, he allowed 21 baserunners over 25.2 innings (0.82 WHIP), gave up four earned runs (1.40 ERA) and struck out 32. He improved his record to 3-0 for the month, 3-2 overall. Yosy Galan walked to lead off the third and moved to second on a balk. Ben Blackwell followed with a soft bouncer to shortstop Jordan Sprinkle. Blackwell beat the throw, which went wide of the bag at first and allowed Galan to score. That was the only run allowed by Peyton Pallette over 4.2 innings, but it turned out to be enough to hang him for the loss (1-5). People are also reading… Hickory’s run in the sixth inning came courtesy of another Dash error. After Luis Mieses doubled and Ian Moller singled to put runners at the corners, Moller stole second base. The throw from catcher Weston Eberly skipped into centerfield, which enabled Mieses to trot home and make it 2-0. The Crawdads added two more insurance runs in the ninth, Galan clubbed his fifth homer of the season. Blackwell doubled for his third hit of the night and scored on Cam Cauley’s single. The Dash (23-26) continued to struggle against Hickory pitching, as Jackson Kelley tossed two scoreless innings and Damian Mendoza added a perfect eighth. It was not until the ninth that Winston-Salem advanced a runner past second base. The Dash eventually brought the go-ahead run to the plate. Facing Gavin Collyer, Shawn Goosenberg singled to start the inning. One out later, Collyer hit both Wes Kath and Chris Lanzilli with pitches to load the bases. An infield hit by Loidel Chapelli scored Goosenberg and kept the bases full. However, Eberly popped up to second and Sprinkle struck out to end the game.",
