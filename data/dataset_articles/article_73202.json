  "text": "Poland: Thousands gather for Corpus Christi worship concerts By Fr. Paweł Rytel-Andrianik & Fr. Jakub Nagi This year, the \"One Heart, One Spirit\" concert in Rzeszow brought together over 25,000 people from Poland and other European countries on the feast of Corpus Christi, celebrated on Thursday. As the organizers stress, \"the concert is a form of prayer, and Christ is the most important. It gathers so many people to worship together on-site and through television, radio, and Internet broadcasts.\" Broadcasts and media coverage of the event reached millions of people in Poland and around the world. The \"One Heart, One Spirit\" orchestra and choir accompanied the concert performers, including nearly 200 choristers and soloists, as well as instrumentalists and volunteers. Participants of the concert enjoyed 26 songs and religious pieces for three hours. Father Andrzej Cypryś, one of the organizers of the concert, Marcin Pospieszalski, music director, and Jan Budziaszek, the MC, welcomed all gathered for the 22nd edition of the “One Heart, One Spirit” concert. Bishop Jan Wątroba, of the Diocese of Rzeszów, gave his blessing at the end. Worship concerts on the day of Corpus Christi are becoming more and more popular in Poland, both in large cities and small towns. They also impact the media, with many people posting reports of the concert on social media. Many attendees are young people and young couples. Thank you for reading our article.
