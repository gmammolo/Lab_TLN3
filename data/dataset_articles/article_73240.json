  "text": "View this post on Instagram {*Did you know you can write on Elephant? Here’s how—big changes: [How to Write & Make Money or at least Be of Benefit on Elephant. ~ Waylon](https://www.elephantjournal.com/2024/02/boring-little-big-update-for-all-elephant-writers-waylon/)} Ten years ago, a friend of mine sent me a link on Facebook. He said, “I think you’ll like this online magazine. You might as well want to [submit an article](https://www.elephantjournal.com/write-for-elephant-journal/).” And so I did. I published my first article on July 13th, 2014. Did I like the magazine? No. I didn’t just “like” it; I fell in love with it. Their content and mission aligned perfectly with my core beliefs. I had just come back from Nepal, so their content encompassed everything that my heart and soul had been craving. The articles I found on their platform about meditation, Buddhism, yoga, breathing techniques, and spirituality in general intrigued me. I was so inspired that I started writing my own Buddhism-related articles. I met other fellow writers and built deep connections with them. I was glad that my friend had sent me that link. That magazine is Elephant Journal. Today I’m an editor. I’m also a writer. But, most of all, I’m a reader—and that’s not going to change anytime soon. The amount of inspiration that I feel on a daily basis in my job is insurmountable. I’ve been through many difficult and challenging times in the last decade. And though there have been many changes in my life, one thing has remained constant: [the power of words](https://elephant-academy.teachable.com/p/findyourvoice-live-course-2024). The articles I continuously read have helped me to overcome tough times. They remind me that no matter how dark it gets, it won’t feel this way forever. They teach me to embrace my emotions and change my perspective. They tell me to acknowledge my fear, loss, and heartbreak. They bring me home. I have found solace and comfort in Buddhist articles. Our Ele-community has written many compelling pieces that are etched on my memory. I feel like sharing them with you today and I sincerely hope they comfort you as they have comforted me: 1.
