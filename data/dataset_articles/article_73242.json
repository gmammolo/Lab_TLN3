  "text": "As President Russell M. Nelson approaches his 100th birthday (September 9, 2024), he is highlighting a place in scripture where Jesus Christ uses the number 100 to teach a lesson about service and love. In the parable of the lost sheep ( Matthew 18 and Luke 15 ), Jesus teaches that we should reach out to others in need the way a caring shepherd would do for his sheep—even for just one lost from a flock of 100. Pointing to this example, President Nelson suggested that a way that people can help commemorate his 100th birthday would be to reach out to “the one” in need. In a message posted to social media channels 100 days before his September 9 birthday, President Nelson stated, “One spiritual offering that would brighten my life is for each of us to reach out to ‘the one’ in our lives who may be feeling lost or alone. Over the coming months I invite you to consider prayerfully: who do you know who may be discouraged? Who might you need to reconcile with or ask for forgiveness? Has one name been on your mind lately, though you haven’t quite known why? As you bring these questions to the Lord, He will inspire you to know how you can reach out and lift one who needs help.” By following the Savior’s example, President Nelson continued, we can “spread the love of Jesus Christ throughout the world.” See the prophet’s post on X (formerly Twitter).",
