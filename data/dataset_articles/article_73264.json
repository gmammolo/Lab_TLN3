  "text": "Adedamola Ogunbewon\nJune 1, 2024\nThe leading Pastor of Salvation Ministries , David Ibiyeomie, has claimed giving God his salary of N5,000 in 1997 led to a series of miracles.\nHe said this in a video posted on Instagram on May 28, 2024.\nIbiyeomie, who was standing behind the pulpit in the video, stated his wife requested his N5,000 salary so that she could buy foodstuff at the market.\nHe claimed that he later heard God saying he should give Him the money instead and obeyed.\nHe also mentioned an hour after he “gave the N5,000 to God,” he received a gift from an unidentified woman that included N25,000, a crate of eggs, a bag of rice, and beans.\nThe televangelist said: “My wife told me she wanted to go to the market in 1997, and my salary was N5,000.”\n“She said to me upstairs, ‘My husband, we have to go to the market’, and, I said to her, ‘I am coming’. But, I heard God say to me, ‘Give me the N5,000. That’s madness!\n“Nobody will give you money physically. Your wife said she wanted to go to the market, and that day, you earned your salary, with no other money elsewhere. And, God said, ‘Give me’? You need faith. You can hear God but without faith, it won’t produce.”\nHe added: “Then, I took the N5,000 and dropped it as a sacrifice. In less than one hour, a woman said God spoke to her, that there was a pastor in town, that she should take N25000, pack a bag of rice, a bag of beans, a crate of eggs, everything in her kitchen, and give it to that man of God. She drove down and dropped everything without even meeting me.”\nIbiyeomie added the woman’s husband later gave her some money.\nHe said: “The same day her husband— a very stingy man— who had never given her N100,000 before gave her N1m, after which he got a job in Abuja.”\nSocial media users reacted to the claims.\nZonaempire wrote: “The same God that told Pastor Sam Adeyemi to relocate to US, abi?”\ntemi. dayo agreed: “Acting in faith.”\ndj_joeteee responded: “Papa, I love you.”\nCiponi4real wrote: “That was how God spoke to my friend in 2021, who gave his Peugeot 406 car to the church; (and) till today, I’m still picking and dropping him. Why his own is different is what I don’t know. I’m tired!”\nclifofoboss stated: “Format in which you can take all that someone has.”\nOn his part, Awojideamos argued: “Giving! Giving!! Giving!!! Can we discuss something else please?”\nprettiesttiana asked: “Please How do I know it is the voice of God speaking to me?”\n@McCoySammy wrote: “This one turn Christianity to Bet9ja.”",
