  "text": "From Jude Owuamanam, Jos Governor Caleb Mutfwang of Plateau State has urged the new president of the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA), Rev. Dr. Job Ayuba Bagat Mallam, to use his preachments to unite the people of the state. He said that ECWA as a church has paid its duties through various aspects of human development. Speaking at the installation of Mallam as the new ECWA president and Rev. Dr. Sunday Congo as the new assistant general secretary, Mutfwang charged the leadership of ECWA to take a bold step by coming out with ideas and policies that will unite the people. Mallam, from Bondon district of Moro’s chiefdom in Kaura local government area of Kaduna State, succeeds Stephen Baba Panya, while the new general secretary, Congo, is of Waja tribe in Balanga local government area of Gombe state. In his inaugural speech, Mallam pledged to serve the church in all sincerity and with the fear of God. He said, “As the 12th president of ECWA, I am acutely aware of the privileges and the responsibilities that accompanied this esteemed position. I pay tribute to the exceptional leaders who have preceded me, recognising the legacy of vision, wisdom and perseverance they have bequeathed to us. I accept this privilege with humility and profound gratitude for the trust you have bestowed upon me.” He promised to carry all members along in the discharge of his pastoral duties. In his goodwill message, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu congratulated the new ECWA president and prayed God to give him more strength and renewed anointing as he takes up another mantle of stewardship in the vineyard of the Lord. Many dignitaries attended the ceremony, held at the ECWA headquarters in Jos. There were goodwill messages from the clergy of other denomination, including the President of the Church of Christ in Nigeria (COCIN), Rev. Dr. Amos Musa Mohzo, who was the guest speaker on the occasion.",
