  "text": "Prof Ngozi Odu, the Deputy Governor of Rivers State, has given assurance to Governor Sim Fubara, stating that God is taking charge of his battles.\nShe expressed confidence that God will continue to fight alongside Fubara, guaranteeing his eventual triumph.\nThis reassurance was conveyed during a Praise Night event organized by the State Government to commemorate Fubara’s first anniversary in Port Harcourt, the capital of Rivers State, on Friday night.\nOdu’s comments come amidst the ongoing conflict between Fubara and the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Nyesom Wike.\nThe power struggle between Wike and Fubara over state control has persisted despite intervention attempts by President Bola Tinubu.\nOdu affirmed, “My esteemed Governor, you are already a victor. The Almighty has removed the obstacles. We will uphold our commitment to prioritize the interests of Rivers State.”\nShe added, “What God has accomplished will endure, as per the scripture proclaiming, ‘Who are you, O great mountain before Zerubbabel? You shall become a plain!’\nAddressing Governor Fubara, she said, “There is no obstacle that God won’t level for us. When God takes charge of the battle, there is no need for us to fight. I am reminded of the story of Gideon in the Bible – he felt inadequate for battle, but God assured him that victory would be His, and indeed Gideon emerged triumphant.”",
