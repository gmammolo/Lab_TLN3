  "text": "Sharing his testimony, the presiding pastor of Salvation Ministries, David Ibiyeomie, revealed that a decision to give God his N5,000 salary in 1997 resulted in a series of miracles.\nThis revelation was made in a video posted on Instagram by the televangelist on May 28, 2024. Standing behind the pulpit, Ibiyeomie recounted how his wife had requested his N5,000 salary to go to the market.\nHowever, he claimed that he heard a divine instruction to give the money to God instead, which he obediently did.\nShortly after offering the N5,000 to God, Ibiyeomie shared that he received N25,000, along with a bag of rice, beans, and a crate of eggs from an unidentified woman.\nReflecting on the incident, he recalled, “In 1997, my wife informed me of her intention to visit the market, and my salary was N5,000.”\n“She mentioned the market trip to me, and I replied that I would join her. However, God’s voice directed me to give Him the N5,000. It seemed irrational!”\nHe emphasized the need for faith in carrying out such instructions, highlighting the importance of aligning actions with spiritual guidance.\nDescribing the turn of events, Ibiyeomie continued, “I offered the N5,000 as a sacrifice. Less than an hour later, a woman received a divine message to deliver N25,000, food items, and kitchen supplies to me without even meeting in person.”\nTo add to the miraculous sequence, the woman’s husband, known for his thriftiness, unexpectedly gifted her N1 million on the same day, leading to a subsequent job offer in Abuja.\nThe responses to Ibiyeomie’s account have varied among social media users, showcasing a range of opinions and perspectives.\nOne user, clifofoboss, remarked, “Format in which you can take all that someone has.”\nWhile another user, Zonaempire, mentioned an alternate instance involving Pastor Sam Adeyemi, prompting further discussion and reflection.\nSupporting Ibiyeomie’s testimony, users like temi. dayo_ and dj_joeteee expressed sentiments of faith and admiration for the pastor.\nIn contrast, some users, including Awojideamos, raised questions and urged for diverse discussions beyond giving as a focal point.\nOthers, like prettiesttiana and Ciponi4real, sought clarification on discerning the voice of God and shared personal anecdotes related to acts of giving and faith.",
