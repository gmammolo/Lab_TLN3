  "text": "GARY — Bishop Robert J. McClory of the Catholic Diocese of Gary ordained Deacons Steven Caraher, 28, and Zach Glick, 29, to the priesthood Saturday at Holy Angels Cathedral. “I really just met Jesus in the Eucharist, and that changed my whole life,” said Glick. “I got into Eucharistic adoration and I learned more about life with God.” Caraher’s faith journey started during Bible study between his sophomore and junior years in college. “That totally changed my life, and I really felt called to be a priest,” he said, adding, “I said ‘yes’ six years ago, and here we are today.” Caraher remembers “feeling awkward and stiff” when he first approached preaching but believes his opportunities at Sunday Masses during the past year have improved his preaching, feeling amazed at “how clearly the Lord speaks.” People are also reading… Growing up, Glick considered joining the U.S. military, especially while pursuing an engineering degree at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Having discerned a vocation to the priesthood, Glick found a way to blend his aspirations. After three years with the Gary diocese, he will begin a five-year commitment to the U.S. Air Force, serving as a military chaplain, where he is eager to “bring the Mass and other sacraments to Catholics who might otherwise not have access to baptism and the anointing of the sick.” As the new priest explained. “We serve not only the enlisted, but their families, too.” Caraher attended Munster High School and Indiana University before attending St. Mary of the Lake/Mundelein Seminary in Illinois. He earned a philosophy degree from Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit. While at IU, Caraher earned degrees in math and computer science, with a minor in theatre. Glick graduated from Highland High School and Rose-Hulman with bachelor and master’s degrees in mechanical engineering. After attending Mundelein Seminary, he earned a philosophy degree from Sacred Heart. As a new priest, Caraher said he is looking forward to hearing confessions, especially with someone who hasn’t been to confession for 30-40 years. “It doesn’t matter how far we’ve strayed from Him; He is so ready to forgive us, and I will get to say those words,” Caraher said. The Munster native is looking forward to celebrating his first Mass at 10 a.m. Sunday at his home parish and hearing confessions. “St. Thomas More is the place that nourished me during my childhood,” Caraher said, “and it will be a really special moment for my first Mass with my family and friends there.” Caraher’s pastor, the Rev. Michael Yadron, said a special song taken from the new priest’s favorite prayer will be performed at that Mass. “Steven is multi-talented and very much a people person,” Yadron said. “He can speak the Gospel in a year people find easy to embrace.” Caraher’s first priestly assignment, effective July 1, will be as associate pastor at Holy Martyrs Parish and Our Lady of Consolation, both in Merrillville. Glick will be associate pastor at Queen of All Saints and St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception, both in Michigan City. Glick looks forward to meeting people’s spiritual needs through counseling and ministering. “Listening is important as we practice imitating Christ as deacons, facilitating personal interaction with Jesus,” Glick explained. “People need to know they are heard and understood by someone who cares.” Glick’s first Mass will be at 2 p.m. Sunday at Our Lady of Grace in Highland with his family and friends. He noted, “I think my six years of seminary has been a blessing for my family because they have grown in their faith and been very supportive and happy for me.” During their time in the seminary, both new priests served during the summer of 2021 with the homeless in Michigan City as volunteers in the Christ in the City program. Living with 8-10 people, they served the homeless at a food pantry and shelter. Caraher recalled having butterflies when he was ordained a deacon last year, “but I am looking forward to entering into the liturgy and being committed in a deeper way now.” He added, “When the bishop rubs the Holy Chrism on my hands, it means my hands are being consecrated to consecrate the Eucharist.” The ordination rite begins with the candidates being presented to the bishop, who questions them about their intentions. The candidates lie prostrate as a sign of humility, after which the bishop silently lays his hands on them, followed by other priests doing the same. The newly-ordained are vested with the stole and chasuble. The bishop then anoints the hands of each candidate, after which he and other priests share the sign of peace with the new priests. Glick admits to being somewhat anxious “about unexpected situations I’ll come across in my ministry, but you just need to think on your feet.” Glick is the younger of two sons to Marc and Joann Glick. Caraher is the oldest of four adult children to P.J. and Joann Caraher. Both sets of parents said their felt “blessed and proud” by their sons’ decision to become priests. McClory called the ordination a “joyous occasion” for the diocese. In his homily, McClory described ordination as “a configuration of Christ’s consecration that (the ordained) are set aside with that which is sacred. You’re not just given a job. You’re given an identity in Jesus Christ.” McClory, who this year marked 25 years as a priest, called the priesthood a “joyful, vibrant, life-giving way to live.” The Gary diocese will hold two ordinations this month. Next Saturday at the cathedral, McClory will ordain 14 men to the diaconate. That includes 12 permanent deacons, in addition to two transitional deacons, who are on track to be ordained to the priesthood in 2025.",
