  "text": "- By [Srishti Pandey](/authors/srishti-pandey) - Published: Sat, 01 Jun 2024 11:57 PM (IST) - Source:JND Director Imtiaz Ali, who is currently enjoying the success of his latest film Amar Singh Chamkila, recently opened up about his childhood readings of the Rig Veda and Bhagavad Gita. In an interview with Ranveer Allahbadia, Ali shared how these sacred texts significantly impacted his life and understanding of people. Ali recounted his early encounter with the hymn of creation from the Rig Veda in a conversation with Ranveer Allahbadia, which he found deeply moving. \"I couldn’t move past it; I understood what it meant,\" he recalled. The Bhagavad Gita, too, holds a special place in his heart and remains a constant presence on his table. He fondly remembered buying it during a train journey in sixth grade when money was tight. \"It was the only book I could afford at the railway station. I also thought people around me would find it weird and wonder why I was reading it,\" he shared. Despite the complexity of some passages, Ali found the Bhagavad Gita’s teachings surprisingly accessible. \"There were a few things I had to re-read ten times to understand, but I understood it. I would read a few pages every day. It’s now deep within me; I’m lucky I was exposed at such a young age. It has helped me understand people better,\" he explained. Ali also enjoys exploring other religious texts, finding them both interesting and entertaining. \"If I find a nugget that resonates with me, it makes my day,\" he added.

He admitted that his attempt to experiment with the romantic comedy didn't pay off. \"So what if it didn’t do well, it is still your film,’ I was told. Toh mujhe bohot dard hua. It is an unfortunate child. I felt a sense of ownership over the film, I felt like telling it, ‘I am not embarrassed of you brother, you are mine, as much as any other film of mine,’\" he said, reflecting on the disappointment and the melancholy he felt. Imtiaz Ali's latest directorial venture, Amar Singh Chamkila, stars Diljit Dosanjh and Parineeti Chopra. This biographical drama, available on Netflix, chronicles the rise and tragic end of the iconic Punjabi singer Amar Singh Chamkila and his wife Amarjot Kaur. The film has received positive reviews from both audiences and critics, further cementing Ali’s reputation as a filmmaker.
