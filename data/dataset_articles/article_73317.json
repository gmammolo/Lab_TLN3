  "text": "‘Historical Atlas of The Prophet's Sirah’: A Detailed Scientific Reference for Noble Biography\nThe King Abdulaziz Foundation for Research and Archives, known as \"Darah,\" places special importance on preserving and documenting Islamic history, recognizing Saudi Arabia's leading role in the Islamic world. This includes acknowledging the Kingdom's honour as the site of the first house of worship for mankind, where the divine revelation descended upon Prophet Muhammad, marking the beginning of his message and serving as the backdrop for his life's events and landmarks.\nIn light of this, the project of the Historical Atlas of the Prophet's Sirah, or “biography” in English, was launched under the directive of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, during his chairmanship of the Board of Trustees of Darah. The project also received continuous follow-up and attention from His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, Crown Prince and Prime Minister, and under the supervision of the Chairman of the Darah Board of Trustees, Prince Faisal bin Salman bin Abdulaziz. The pioneering idea for a comprehensive Atlas project focusing on the noble biography of the Prophet Muhammad was initiated under their leadership.\nDarah collaborates with the Pilgrim Experience Program to develop this project, aligning with its goals and affirming its interest in all aspects of Islamic and Arab history. Drawing on its scholarly expertise in historical atlases, Darah has enlisted a select group of historians, researchers, and scholars from various universities and historical research centres. They utilize reliable sources and advanced technologies to ensure the project's completion to the highest standards.\nThrough this scientific project, Darah aims to document the sites and landmarks of the Prophet's biography from their original sources, employing the latest technologies such as geographic coordinates, satellite imagery, and detailed maps. It also aims to create a scholarly reference on the Prophet's biography, transforming historical texts from written manuscripts into diagrams, forms, and visual paths.",
