  "text": "Entertainment of Saturday, 1 June 2024 Source: [www.ghanaweb.com](/GhanaHomePage/aboutus.php) Nacee's 'Aseda' has emerged as the 'Gospel Song of the Year' at the Telecel Ghana Music Awards 2024. The song, which has touched the hearts of many with its uplifting lyrics and harmonious blend of traditional and contemporary gospel rhythms, stood out among a strong list of nominees. The competition was fierce, with each nominee bringing something unique to the table. From Patience Nyarko's 'Tears of Joy' to Diana Hamilton's 'Say Amen,' the category was a showcase of the rich tapestry of Ghanaian gospel music. However, it was Nacee's 'Aseda' that captured the adoration of the Academy and the voters. Nacee, known for his soul-stirring music and powerful voice, on Aseda delivered on the message of gratitude, which is central to the song.' The song has been a staple in churches and on gospel radio stations throughout the year, marking it as a favorite for the award.
