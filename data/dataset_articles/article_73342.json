  "text": "Kanyakumari: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday wrapped up his 45-hour meditation and visit to Vivekananda Rock Memorial by paying floral tributes to the statue of Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar.The Prime Minister has been meditating from Thursday evening to Saturday afternoon at the Dhyana Mandapam where Swami Vivekananda is believed to have meditated. After completing his meditation, Modi took a ferry to the 133-foot statue of Thiruvalluvar located near the rock memorial. Dressed in white, he placed a floral garland at the statue.Around 3.15 pm, Modi departed from Kanyakumari to Thiruvananthapuram on a chopper. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman later shared a message on ‘X’, written by the PM at Vivekananda Rock Memorial. “Visiting the ‘Vivekananda Rock Memorial’ at Kanyakumari, the southernmost tip of India, I feel a divine energy. It is on this rock that Mother Parvati and Swami Vivekananda had meditated. Later, Eknath Ranade transformed this rock into a ‘Shila Smarak’ that brought Swami Vivekananda’s thoughts to life,” read the message.The Prime Minister further noted that Swami Vivekananda, a leader of spiritual renaissance, has been his ideal, energy and source of spirituality. “Years ago, after travelling across the entire country, when Swami Vivekananda meditated here, it was here that he envisioned a new direction for India’s revival. It is my fortune that today, after so many years, as India embodies the values and ideals of Swami Vivekananda, I too have had the opportunity to meditate at this sacred place,” he observed.“My meditation at this ‘Shila Smarak’ is one of the unforgettable moments of my life. Sitting at the feet of ‘Ma Bharati’, I once again reaffirm my resolve that every moment of my life and every particle of my body will always be dedicated to the service of the nation. With wishes for the progress of the nation and the welfare of its citizens, I offer my utmost reverence to ‘Ma Bharati’,” added the PM.Kanyakumari superintendent of police E Sundaravathanam said that with heavy security deployed across the district and all important junctions, there were no untoward incidents and the PM’s stay went smoothly.We also published the following articles recentlyPM Modi begins 2-day meditation at Kanniyakumari's Vivekananda Rock MemorialPM Modi meditates at Vivekananda Rock Memorial's Dhyan Mandapam, visited Bhagavathi Amman temple, paid respects to spiritual figures, and made trips to Pratapgarh and Kedarnath temple.110567788PM Modi meditates at Vivekananda rock memorial for the upliftment of Bharat: BJP's CR KesavanPM Modi meditates at Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanniyakumari for India's upliftment, following Swami Vivekananda's footsteps.110584657First pictures of PM Modi meditating at Vivekananda memorial in KanniyakumariPM Narendra Modi meditated at Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari, wearing orange attire in front of Swami Vivekananda's statue.110581050",
