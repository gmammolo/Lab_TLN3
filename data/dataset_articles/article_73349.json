  "text": "Perhaps, the greatest tragedy of human history is man’s failure to achieve a high level of God-realization, or deeper discovery of God. The way to attain realization of God is to contemplate in God’s creations. Prior to the scientific age, humans knew very little about the creations of God. In ancient times, the framework did not exist which was required for attaining a high level of God-realization.\nIn present times, the scientific revolution has made available to a person that superior framework which was predicted thus in the Quran: “We shall show them Our signs in the universe and within themselves, until it becomes clear to them that this is the Truth.” (41:53)\nIn ancient times, because of the absence of any scientific framework, it was difficult to attain a high level of realization. Even in present times, in spite of the scientific framework available to man, he has not been able to attain a high level of God-realization, the reason being that, in present times, man has been diverted from thinking positively. This, without doubt, has been the greatest deprivation for an individual.\nA high realization of God is the greatest of blessings for a person and it is possible for everyone to reach such a high level of realization. But for this to happen, one must completely desist from negative thinking. Positive thinking is essential in all circumstances.\nThose who can fulfill this condition will certainly succeed in attaining a high level of realization.\nIt is a tragedy of human history that the majority of human beings have fallen into negative thinking on one pretext or the other. They have not been able to adhere to positive thinking and have, therefore, not been able to attain God-realization. This is the greatest reason for the unattainability of a high level of realization.",
