  "text": "When Mel Manuel came out as queer as an 8-year-old, some members of their devout Southern Baptist family believed all queer people were condemned to hell. Manuel, of Covington, didn’t know “a single LGBTQ person.” “I had to be quiet my whole life about who I was,” Manuel said. “My parents did not accept it. My family absolutely did not accept it. Our school system did nothing.” Thirty-two years later, Manuel, 40, who uses gender-neutral pronouns, feels they can now be the queer person they wished they’d known as a kid. That drove Manuel to help [organize the first Pride parade on the northshore](https://www.nola.com/news/communities/st_tammany/st-tammany-parish-will-have-its-first-ever-lgbtq-pride-parade-after-emotional-meeting-louisiana/article_4a8ea3c0-f8e3-11ee-b218-e3f445ad8399.html), which took place on Saturday with along Mandeville's lakefront. More than 500 people marched in the parade. “It feels empowering,\" Manuel said. \"It feels like saying, ‘I’m not going back to the closet, St. Tammany.’” Along the parade route a giant, rainbow-colored pelican statue trailed behind a Jeep with its own rainbow decals. Overhead, dark clouds threatened downpours, but the rain stayed light as paraders made their way along Lakeshore Drive. Outside the bars along the route, patrons came out to wave and show support, as a teenager asked a drag queen for a selfie. A handful of protesters showed up as well, holding up anti-LGBTQ+ signs and reciting prayers. Manuel teamed up with Jeremy Thompson to found Queer Northshore, which helped organize the parade and strives to create a community for queer people in St. Tammany Parish and across the northshore. To its members, having an organization devoted to advocating for queer people feels especially necessary in the face of what some members say is anti-LGBTQ sentiment on the northshore. They note the challenges some St. Tammany residents have filed to restrict books in the public libraries with LGBTQ+ themes. Last year, a billboard in Abita Springs that read “Ban hate, not books,” drawn by a trans teenager, [was torched](https://www.nola.com/news/crime_police/ban-hate-not-books-sign-in-abita-springs-torched/article_150e7d24-d571-11ed-9e05-574365c519c2.html). And just this week, as the parade drew near, a Pride flag was stolen from a Mandeville home and burned, some [media outlets reported](https://www.fox8live.com/2024/05/31/pride-flag-stolen-burned-near-mandeville-ahead-first-pride-parade-community-rallies-support/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR2PpM6ja2isQVHNuVNx_VtEWkEqqOWRhqgSly89dtKpEKgnEqVXg25BTEk_aem_ZmFrZWR1bW15MTZieXRlcw). But the group’s members are undeterred. “The more visible we become the more we’re going to experience this kind of hate,” Manuel wrote in a comment on Facebook about the flag burning. “We fight back with MORE FLAGS!” another user wrote. How it got started Queer Northshore started as a Facebook group in the waning days of the coronavirus pandemic. Manuel and Thompson, who had lived in the two sides of a shotgun house in New Orleans, moved to St. Tammany. “A few months in, we realized, not so surprisingly, that it was incredibly hard to make friends,” Thompson said. “So we did the conventional thing. We created a Facebook group. … There was no aspiration for it other than, like, it would be cool to attract a bunch of people and have parties and events and hang out.” The group exploded. Two years later, it has 2,400 members. It’s extremely active, with its members posting dozens of times every day. The group has provided invaluable support to St. Tammany’s queer community. For instance, some members have sought advice from others about finding trans-friendly health care on the northshore. Others have formed important friendships. For some, the group kept them from decamping from the northshore altogether. “My girlfriend, who is smarter than I am, said, ‘Hey, look, if I find us friends that you respect and that you want to be around, will you stay?’” said Jamie Foster of Abita Springs, one of the group’s straight, cis-gendered members. “I thought, ‘Of course I will, but there’s nobody here like that.’ And then she immediately proved me wrong.” “We didn’t know this community was even out there,” his girlfriend, Evette Randolph, said. “There wasn’t anywhere to meet, there wasn’t anywhere to feel safe.” Ruby Porter, who built the parade's pelican statue, said that she felt lost before she found the group. “I had really just come out,” she said. “I was in a bad place. I was really depressed. And they really helped out a lot, and gave me a place to be seen.” “I really kind of owe them my life,” she added. Growing into advocacy But as controversy around books in the parish’s libraries started to ramp up, Manuel and Thompson realized the group needed to evolve. “At that point we decided, the need isn’t just for hangouts,” Manuel said. “We’re being targeted by people in our own community.” Thompson and Manuel incorporated Queer Northshore as a nonprofit, and helped start the St. Tammany Parish Library Alliance, a group that has fought to keep LGBTQ-themed books on the library’s shelves. Manuel is even running [a long-shot campaign](https://www.mel4louisiana.com/) for Congress against U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, a ranking Republican. Members of Queer Northshore described this weekend’s parade as the culmination of community building and organizing, a pivotal moment in the group’s effort to reshape the stereotype that the northshore isn’t welcoming to queer people or their allies. \"I’m not trying to make children queer,” Manuel said, noting that their own child is straight. “I’m trying to make queer children feel loved and accepted and like they’re normal, because they are.”",
