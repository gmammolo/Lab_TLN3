When Pittsburgh was only a town with about 1,400 houses, Jacob and Barbara Negley donated a parcel of land to allow for the construction of a small meeting\nThe current church, the fifth one on this site, was designed in the early 1930s by renowned architect Ralph Adams Cram, who was already known for his work in New York (Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine) and the chapel for Princeton University. Richard and Jennie King Mellon donated $3.9 million to underwrite the construction of a church in honor of their mothers and to serve as a monument to Presbyterianism in Western Pennsylvania. Cram himself said. \"Of all the cathedrals and churches I have built, this is my masterpiece. This church has been the most profound spiritual experience of my life.\"\nArchitectural Facts About ELPC\nSanctuary Dimensions | 202 ft. long by 117 feet wide by 75 feet high\nSeating Capacity | over 1,300 people\nHeight of Church Tower | 300 feet\nTotal Area of Church | 280,000 sq. ft.\nThe church contains a basketball gym, a social hall capable of seating over 300 people, and a four-lane duckpin bowling alley. The entire church is built around an interior courtyard, which is also known as a \"garth.\"\nTopics.
