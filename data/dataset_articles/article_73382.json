  "text": "Our Reporter\nJune 2, 2024\nThe General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye , has blessed the newly reconstructed RCCG Lagos Province 28 Headquarters, located in the Ogudu GRA Scheme 2 area of Lagos State.\nThe church, known as the Province of Latter Glory, was formally dedicated on May 26, 2024, after a devastating fire destroyed the previous structure nearly three years ago.\nAssistant Pastor in Charge of the Province, Thompson Olulade, reflected on the challenging journey of rebuilding the church. “It was a very big challenge and a very hectic journey initially. Securing demolition permits from the government was particularly tiring. But we bless God for what He has done today. We can now celebrate a new structure, a new edifice that people can identify with. The scripture is fulfilled in the life of LP28; that the glory of the latter house shall be greater than the former.”\nAddressing the youth, Olulade emphasized the importance of acquiring skills and knowledge, especially in the current harsh economic climate. “We advise the youth to learn more skills and keep themselves equipped with the right knowledge. They should affiliate with the right people to shun evil and make progress even in adversity. We encourage them to draw closer to God because, without Him, we can achieve nothing in life.”\nPastor Silvanus Akinsulore of Edo Province 5 who was pastor in charge of the province when the outbreak occurred recounted the tragic fire incident that necessitated the rebuild.\nRelated Posts “It happened around 6 a.m. on May 9, 2021. I had a vigil in the church until around 3 a.m., only to be called at 6 a.m. about the fire. By the time I arrived, it was too late to save anything. Today, I am so happy that God has brought beauty from ashes. I am grateful that my family and the church survived, and we can celebrate with our leaders.”\nEmphasizing the importance of fire safety, Akinsulore added, “Every public building should have a standby fire extinguisher and a reliable water system. Our government should also be more proactive regarding fire incidents.”\nPastor Bola Orekoya, the Pastor in Charge of Province 28, praised the safety measures implemented to prevent future incidents.",
