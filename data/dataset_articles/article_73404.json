  "text": "The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) has launched a N400 million digital skills initiative, titled 'A World of Unlimited Possibilities,' to commemorate the 82nd birthday of its General Overseer, Pastor Enoch Adeboye. This initiative aims to equip over 1,000 Nigerian youths with vital digital skills, promoting economic growth and alleviating poverty.\nWhy this matters: This initiative has broader significance as it addresses the critical issue of poverty alleviation and economic growth in Nigeria. By equipping youths with digital skills, it has the potential to create a ripple effect that can lead to sustainable economic development and improved living standards.\nOver 12,000 Nigerian youths applied for the\nprogram, with 5,000 taking an online test, and 1,000 selected for the physical meeting. The initiative focuses on youths aged 15-45, preparing them for the future of work by providing them with the necessary digital skills.\nPastor Oluwagbemileke Adeboye, the personal assistant and son of Pastor Enoch Adeboye, emphasized the initiative's goal of empowering Nigerian youths to start their own\nbusinesses and support the economy. 'We are hoping that in nine months, people that have come will give birth to their own businesses and companies along that line, but with the mindset of 'A World of Unlimited Possibilities,' they will help support the economy,' he said.\nFatai Williams, CEO of\nAfrica Mission Global, highlighted the broader impact of the initiative on society. 'The initiative would be extremely impactful for the youth as it would reach a larger number of people in society based on what the digital initiative offers. So when you scale up young people with digital knowledge, they can fit into any sector based on their digital skills,' he noted.\nThe program is part of RCCG's\nContinent 3s digital transformation drive and is expected to have a long-term impact on the Nigerian economy. It aims to create jobs and alleviate poverty by equipping youths with the skills needed to thrive in a digital world. The church does not intend to employ the youths directly but rather to empower them to start their own businesses and create jobs for others.\nPastor Enoch Adeboye's 82nd birthday marks another milestone in his life, which has been characterized by his commitment to spreading\nlove, faith, and hope globally. His visionary leadership has transformed countless lives, inspiring millions to walk in the path of righteousness and pursue God's purpose.\nThe RCCG's digital skills initiative demonstrates its commitment to not only spiritual growth but also to the economic and social development of Nigerian youths. By equipping them with digital skills, the church aims to create a ripple effect that will alleviate poverty and promote economic growth across the nation.\nTo recap, the RCCG's N400 million digital skills initiative, launched in celebration of Pastor Enoch Adeboye's 82nd birthday, aims to transform the lives of over 1,000 Nigerian youths by providing them with vital digital skills. This initiative is expected to have a significant impact on poverty alleviation and economic growth in Nigeria.\nKey Takeaways\n- RCCG launches N400m digital skills initiative for 1,000 Nigerian youths.\n- Initiative aims to equip youths with vital digital skills for economic growth.\n- Program focuses on youths aged 15-45, preparing them for the future of work.\n- Goal is to empower youths to start their own businesses and support the economy.\n- Initiative expected to have a long-term impact on poverty alleviation and economic growth.",
