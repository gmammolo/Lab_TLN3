  "text": "National\nMarching for Life\nLCMS participation in life marches continues to increase each year, with Lutherans standing up for life at events all around the country.\nGod is the giver of life and the creator of each person. LCMS Life Ministry witnesses to the sanctity of life by proclaiming Christ crucified and by gathering as Lutherans to stand up for the life of the unborn. Through life marches, Lutherans remember the lives lost to abortion, pray for mothers who are vulnerable to abortion, and ask the Lord to turn the hearts of abortion advocates to His Son.\nJanuary 2024 marked the 50th anniversary of the National March for Life in Washington, D.C. Even though Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, the battle to preserve life and abolish radical abortion laws continues. The vote on abortion now occurs in legislatures at the state level, so LCMS Life Ministry has shifted its focus to the life marches taking place around the country. During many state life marches, participants have an opportunity to make appointments directly with their representatives to encourage them to protect and care for all human life, from conception to natural death.\nLCMS participation in life marches continues to increase each year. LCMS Life Ministry supported six events with approximately 350 participants in 2021–2022. That grew to 17 events with 950 participants in 2022–2023, and 23 events with approximately 2,000 participants in 2023–2024. Mercy dollars are a tremendous blessing in the effort to speak up for life at marches and are used to support LCMS participation in marches across the country.\nLearn More\n- Lutherans Engage article:\nConfessing Christ in the Capital\n- Reporter article:\n‘A March Behind the Cross’: Lutherans Advocate, Teach, Care for Life\n- Reporter article:\n‘This Is the Moment’: Chicago Marchers Pray for Change\n- Reporter article:\n‘March on the Arch’ Draws Hundreds in Support of Life\n- Reporter article:\nAdvocate for Life All Year Long\n- Reporter article:\n‘Fundamentally a Spiritual Issue’: Lutherans Attend First Post-Roe March for Life\n- Reporter article:\nLutherans March for Life in Illinois\n- Reporter article:\n‘Life Magnified’: Lutherans March, Rally in Austin",
