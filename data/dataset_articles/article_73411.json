  "text": "The Bada Mangal festival kicked-off in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, last week on May 28th. It will be celebrated on four Tuesdays - May 28, June 4, June 11 and June 18. The Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb of the festival ensures the participation of Hindus and Muslims, making it unique to Awadh. But there is an Hanuman temple in Lucknow's Aliganj where it's believed that the festival originated. The temple is more than 400-years old.It's also believed that the Hanuman temple was built by Nawab of Awadh, Saadat Ali Khan's mother - Chhatar Kunwar. She was a Hindu and since Saadat Ali Khan was born on a Tuesday, he was affectionately called Mangaloo (Tuesday is Mangal in Hindi). Tuesday is dedicated to lord Hanuman and it was because of Chhatar's Hindu faith that the temple was built. It was after her marriage, Chhatar Kunwar was called Begum Alia. According to a mythological story, there was a garden known as Hanuman Bari. During the Ramayana era, when Laxman and Hanuman were taking Sita to Bithoor,in Uttar Pradesh ad they stopped at this place for the night. Hanuman protected Sita during that time. Later, during the Islamic period, the place was renamed Islam Bari. It is said that Bajrang Bali appeared in Begum's dream and mentioned that there was an idol of him in that garden. When the ground was excavated, an idol was found. With great reverence, the Begum placed the idol on a throne and transported it on an elephant to establish a temple near Bada Imambara in Lucknow. However, when the elephant reached the current location of the Aliganj temple, it sat down and refused to move despite the mahout's efforts. This was seen as a divine message, and the temple was constructed at that spot with funds from the state treasury. This is the old Hanuman temple of Aliganj. The crescent symbol can still be seen on the temple's spire.There are three main beliefs behind the celebration of Bada Mangal. According to one belief, a plague spread in the city, causing many people to seek refuge in the temple, where they survived. It was the month of Jyeshtha at that time, and from then on, the festival of Bada Mangal began. Another belief is that a Marwari perfume merchant named Jatmal visited the temple, but his perfume did not sell. When the Nawab learned of this, he bought all the perfume. Grateful, Jatmal renovated the temple and donated a silver canopy. Some people believe that a female member of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah's family was very ill and recovered after prayers at the temple. That day was a Tuesday in the month of Jyeshtha. The festival, which began at that time, continues to this day. Both Hindus and Muslims participate in the bhandara (communal feast) organised during this festival. Initially, the offerings were simple dishes like jaggery and roasted grains. The joint Hindu-Muslim feasts are a unique tradition of this region and are not found outside Awadh. The offerings have also evolved to include dishes like puri-sabzi, matar paneer, noodles, chole bhature, ice cream, and golgappas, which are popular among the youth and help in continuing this religious tradition.",
