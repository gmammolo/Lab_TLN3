  "text": "वियतनामी लोगों के दिलों में एक जीवित बुद्ध एक भिक्षु था जो 4 वर्षों तक पूरे वियतनाम में नंगे पैर घूमता रहा। कोण है वोह? 有一个和尚赤脚走遍越南四年。现在受到很多人的尊重。 那是谁？ Chanel: https://youtube.com/@minhtuemonk-vietnambuddh-rv7fr?si=_F6zr_9MddE5RVX- Buddha in the hearts of Vietnamese people Ascetic monks in Vietnam walked across the country for 6 years. From 2019 to 2024: The first 2 years of Master Thich Minh Tue's practice at the temple and in seclusion in the cave. For 4 years, I have been walking along the national highway from the North to the South, and vice versa from the South to the North. He traveled on foot through all provinces and cities in Vietnam. Food & Eating: During the trip: only accept vegetarian food once a day and eat before noon. His clothes were made of patchwork fabric. Master Sleep sits next to him under the corner of a tree or sleeps in the cemetery and only sleeps sitting, not sleeping lying down. By this year, this monk became widely known through Youtube and tickok channels. And there are also many people who have shaved their hair like Master Minh Tue and have followed him as an 'escort'. Local people welcomed them on both sides of the road in large numbers, obstructing traffic and causing the traffic police to get involved. What will the Master's upcoming journey be like?",
