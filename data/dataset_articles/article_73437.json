  "text": "States » NorthPosted at: Jun 2 2024 12:38PM Yogi offers prayers at Gorakhnath templeGorakhpur, June 2 (UNI) A day after the final phase of voting of the Lok Sabha elections, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday offered prayers at the Gorakhnath temple, performed darshan of his guru and served cows. The morning drizzle added to the joyous and affectionate atmosphere as he spent time among the cattle and children. Despite his busy schedule due to the two-month long Lok Sabha elections, the CM frequently visited the Gorakhnath Temple, offering prayers, performing gauseva and interacting with children, his office said. Yogi, who is also Goraksha Peethadheeshwar has been staying at Gorakhnath Temple since Friday evening. His Sunday routine was traditional. After offering prayers to Lord Shiva and Guru Gorakhnath he visited the statue of Mahant Avaidyanath to seek his blessings. Afterwards, as usual, he went on a tour of the temple premises. While walking around, he noticed children who had come with their families. CM Yogi affectionately patted them and showered blessings. The children appeared to enjoy the company of the CM amid the drizzle. CM Yogi also visited the cowshed (goshala) to perform gauseva. He called the cows by their names, Shyama, Gauri, Nandi, and Bhola and affectionately fed them jaggery. UNI AB INGTags: #Yogi offers prayers at Gorakhnath temple",
