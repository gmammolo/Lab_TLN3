  "text": "June 2nd, 2024\nBy Lorna Bevan\nContributing Writer for Wake Up World\nRevolutionary Shifts Bring New Freedom\n“If you do not fill your energetic field with new experiences, new ideas, and new versions of yourself, your field becomes dim and worn, bored with the same old story.” ~Barbara Marciniak\nWithout any exaggeration, this is a watershed moment when an old way of life is being over lit by the New. Finally, there are glimmers of new light in dark places……accompanied by a literal breath of fresh air.\nJust look at this week’s stunning line up of Uranus conjunct Sedna/ Jupiter/ Mercury/ New Moon/ Venus in Air sign Gemini – it has personal choice and freedom written all over it.\nCircle June 3 2024 when Jupiter at 1° 53’ Gemini exactly trines Pluto at 1° 53’ Aquarius.\nGemini and Aquarius are both air signs and associated with people and ideas in free circulation. This date is a pointer to life after 2025, when revolutionary Uranus will be in Gemini and the worldwide web changes beyond recognition.\nStarting now, the new long term magnetics of the crystalline Air element are going to change your communications, connections, communities and alliances in unexpected ways -flagging up impending huge shifts in technology that will reshape your mental and social environment. Individually and collectively, our tastes, preferences, values are going to shift quite radically.\nTune up and turn up your BS detector as the noise from the Tower of Babel that is the media reaches a new pitch whilst sinking to new depths……\npull away from group-think , from seeking safety and anonymity in crowds and echo chambers to connect with the people who are standing on common ground with you\nwork in/with multiple Tribes – be a node/a hub/a connector\nbecome very, very deliberate about only energising your energetic space with meaningful touchstones – only those places, people and things that speak to your soul, that are a reflection of your energy signature….\nbecome very, very selective in your choice of social media feeds, online communities, the books you read, the programs you watch, the people you spend time with – what you feed your mind is as important as what you feed your body. This becomes your psychic clothing, your armour, your protection\nfocus on feeding friendships and not defeating foes . No matter how difficult it might be, we have to build alliances, create community. Create safe places and gather your tribe to have radical conversations about uncertain futures. When we come together, we learn how to heal.\nconsistently update your technology and expand your communication platforms\nChandra Symbol New Moon Gemini 16: a single sunflower wilting and dropping its seeds\n“The sun shines so bright that it compels all of us to empty ourselves out and bake in the light and the warmth of spirit. We are transfixed by solar power and impelled to unite with our destiny, no matter how extravagant or unlikely that destiny proves to be. A momentum is pulsating, with edges to track.\nIn order to do so you have to breathe into it and let go a whole lot, and then there you are, calling onward. You can hear it. Everybody else can too. And now the spirit-caller cracks through and brings futures alive in the light of a sun that never sets.” Inside Degrees Elias Lonsdale\nAries Weekly Forecast: June 2nd – 9th 2024\nAs several planets shift into air sign Gemini, make plans to study, travel and generally expand your horizons. Get organised, find a big project you’re longing to get your teeth into and make a start on June 3 rd , a well starred day for new and bold adventures.\nWho do you know who can help you?\nTaurus Weekly Forecast: June 2nd – 9th 2024\nTake heart!

Choose something you’re passionate about and gift it to yourself for your birthday.\nPress the restart button\nCancer Weekly Forecast: June 2nd – 9th 2024\nAs so many planets align in Gemini, the sign just before Cancer, your 12 th House of dreams, spirit and reflection-the engine room of your chart-is going to become much richer. The days between June 3-6 th at the New Moon are excellent for the withdrawal and private time you need to process recent developments. By stepping back, you’ll emerge restored to enjoy your birthday month.\nFind a sanctuary and step off the treadmill\nLeo Weekly Forecast: June 2nd – 9th 2024\nAs Jupiter leaves the pinnacle of your chart after a year- long visit and a cluster of planets gathers in Gemini, you might feel slightly bereft.

It’s all about claiming personal freedom, making connections and leaving your comfort zone in the dust.\nThe cage door is wide open\nScorpio Weekly Forecast: June 2nd – 9th 2024\nAs Jupiter enters Gemini until July 2025, aligning with your own planet transformer Pluto, expect to start navigating some deep psychological territory.
