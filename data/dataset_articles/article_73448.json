  "text": "The 10th edition of the annual 'Open Churches Weekend' is in full swing, with this year's theme focusing on flowers and plants.\n58 churches and chapels are taking part with the aim of boosting religious cultural heritage.\nNot only will various churches exceptionally open their doors to the public, but a cultural programme will also be offered in 21 churches and chapels. This ranges from workshops, exhibitions and special visits to musical entertainment.\nIn Ehlange-sur-Mess, for example, an after-work event with DJs was organised in the church on Friday evening.\nIn Kaundorf, a theatre play is performing around the St. Pirmin church. A dozen actors take the guests on a journey through the centuries. The play tells the story of St Pirmin, who is said to have healed his eyes in the spring on the Përmesknupp.\nAnother chapel that is exceptionally open this weekend is the Loretto Chapel in Clervaux. It was built in the 18th century by Count Clervaux, who wanted to create a place of pilgrimage for people to share their grievances with St Mary of Loretto. The room in the chapel is built in the late baroque rococo style and there are many floral and plant motifs.\nOn Sunday, 2 June, you can visit a whole series of churches. The whole programme can be found on\nwww.oppekierchen.lu.",
