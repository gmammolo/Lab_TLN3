  "text": "Pope Francis in his weekly General Audience at the Vatican prayed for divine blessings of consolation and strength for victims of the recent landslide in Papua New Guinea, and offered his encouragement to the civil authorities and emergency personnel as they continue their relief efforts.\nThe Pope, who is set to visit the nation along with Indonesia, Singapore and Timor-Leste, in September, also prayed especially for the deceased, their loved ones, and for the rescue of those still missing.\n“May the Lord comfort their families, those who lost their homes and the Papuan people, whom, God willing, I will meet next September.”\nParts of a mountain in the Maip-Mulitaka area in Enga province in the country’s north collapsed in the early hours of Friday May 24, 2024.\nAs the death toll continues to rise, Pope Francis expressed his closeness to all those afflicted by the devastating landslide in Papua New Guinea.\n“I wish to assure you of my prayers for the victims of the massive landslide that swept through some villages in Papua New Guinea.”.\nOver 2,000 people are estimated to have died, with up to 70,000 people living in the area impacted by the disaster.\nSimilarly, the Pope insisted that amid war, children are truly the victims who suffer most, as he recalls a recent audience with Ukrainian children who had suffered burns and lost legs in the ‘cruelty’ of war. “Children suffer… Children in war suffer.”\n“These little boys and girls have to start walking, to move with artificial arms; they have lost their smiles. It is very bad, very sad when a child loses their smile. Let us pray for the Ukrainian children.”\nThe Pope also urged the audience not to forget the great suffering of Palestine and Israel, as he appealed for peace. “Let the war end,” he stated as he recalled the plight of Myanmar and other countries at war.",
