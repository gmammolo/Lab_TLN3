  "text": "Only one third of American Catholics believe in the true presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, according to a 2019 Pew Research study. But the Church in the United States is taking action to change this—one way is through the big screen. The new film “Jesus Thirsts” seeks to guide viewers to rediscover the Mass and the Eucharist. And the Executive Producer believes this has both the power to change minds and change lives. DEACON STEVE GRECO Executive Producer, jesusthirstsfilm.com After you see this film, this documentary, this love letter to you, you're going to feel like it is necessary for me to go as often as possible and now I want to go to reconciliation, now I want to go to adoration. FLASH I've heard this over and over again with people who have seen it in our previews and in our premieres, it is absolutely amazing how it changes your life. The film highlights the biblical origin of the Eucharist. But it also takes viewers on a journey around the modern world—from downtown Chicago to the countryside of Slovakia and the villages of Uganda to show Eucharistic miracles and the power the Mass holds for people of all walks of life. Featuring global Catholic leaders like Dr. Scott Hahn and Eduardo Verástegui, the filmmakers are confident that viewers will be compelled to share their rediscovered faith. DEACON STEVE GRECO Executive Producer, jesusthirstsfilm.com What this film absolutely, positively, guaranteed—it will create evangelists. Because once you really receive the real presence, the reality of the real presence, the reality of how much Jesus loves us, you have to share it with other people, you feel compelled to do that. “Jesus Thirsts” can be found in theaters across the United States only on June 4, 5 and 6—just about one month before tens of thousands of people will gather in Indianapolis for the National Eucharistic Congress.
