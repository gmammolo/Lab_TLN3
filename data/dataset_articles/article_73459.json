  "text": "Iran’s Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani has called on Muslim countries to work hand in hand and not miss any chance to support the Palestinian nation. He made the remarks on Saturday during a telephone conversation with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. Bagheri Kani enumerated the crimes, which are being committed by “the cruel and bloodthirsty Zionist regime” in the Gaza Strip, among them the incursion into Rafah and blocking the southern city’s crossing, halting much-needed aid delivery to the besieged Palestinian territory. “The Islamic countries’ cooperation and synergy creates an important and effective capacity to support the oppressed people of Gaza,” he said. “Muslim states must spare no opportunity to support the Palestinian people.” Israel waged a genocidal war on Gaza on October 7 after the Hamas resistance movement carried out its historic operation against the usurping entity in retaliation for the regime’s intensified atrocities against the Palestinian people. On May 7, the occupying regime began a ground offensive in Rafah, home to about a million displaced Palestinians who have fled from the rest of Gaza amid the Israeli onslaught. So far, Israel has killed at least 36,379 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 82,407 others in the Gaza Strip. Read more: Also in his remarks, Bagheri Kani expressed gratitude to Turkey for its messages of condolence and sympathy over the martyrdom Iranian President Ebrahim Raeisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in a helicopter crash last month. He further expressed hope that Iran and Turkey would discuss issues of mutual interest on the sidelines of an emergency meeting of foreign minister of the group of Developing Eight (D8) Islamic countries in Istanbul. Fidan, for his part, described as very important and productive the continuation of Ankara- Tehran consultations on the issue of Palestine and other important bilateral and regional topics. He also emphasized the need for coordination among Islamic countries on the Palestinian issue and welcomed a proposal by the Islamic Republic for an extraordinary meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on the situation in Gaza. The Zionist regime has besieged Gaza with the aim of eliminating the Palestinian people, and thus all capacities should be used to stop the Zionists’ genocide in Gaza and crimes against humanity, he noted. Additionally, the top Turkish diplomat once again condoled with Iran on the demise of President Raeisi and Foreign Minister Amir-Abdollahian.
