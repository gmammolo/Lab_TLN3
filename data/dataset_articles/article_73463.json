  "text": "Editor's Picks\nUmma party religious leader urges unity amid division over Tagadum membership\nJune 1, 2024 (CAIRO) – Amid growing internal divisions within the National Umma Party over participation in the Coordinating Council of Democratic Civil Forces “Tagadum”, Abdel Mahmoud Abu, Secretary-General of the party’s religious wing, the Ansar Affairs Authority, has issued a series of recommendations aimed at preventing a split.\nIn a statement, Abu urged party leaders to “close the gaps that deepen disagreements” and view recent events as a “practice exercise for democracy.” He called for reconciliation and a renewed focus on activating the party’s institutions, ensuring members are informed and involved in decision-making.\nThe dispute centres on the party’s involvement in Tagadum. The Presidency and Coordinating Council favour participation, while the party leader and General Secretariat oppose it. The disagreement has escalated into a public exchange of statements.\nAbu emphasized the need for a consultative approach, respecting the mandates of party leaders while keeping institutions informed. He also recommended assigning tasks to specialized cadres to assist institutions in fulfilling their roles, especially given that their mandates have been extended due to unforeseen circumstances.\nInternal strife within the party intensified following last week’s inaugural conference of the Tagadum coalition. A group of National Umma Party leaders, calling themselves the “Institutional Reform” group, held a press conference in Port Sudan, criticizing Tagadum and the acting party leader, a key figure in the coalition.\nThe rebellious group condemns the coalition for its alleged backing of the Rapid Support Forces.\nAcknowledging these signs of division, party figure Zeinab al-Sadiq Al-Mahdi revealed in an interview with Sudan Tribune that differing positions among party leaders have become increasingly apparent.\nActing party leader Fadlallah Burma Nasir deemed the press conference “unconstitutional” and in violation of the party’s constitution and political line. He vowed to hold the participants accountable through party disciplinary procedures.",
