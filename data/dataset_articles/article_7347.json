  "text": "PNP, MMDA stress maximum tolerance for devotees\nThe Department of Health (DOH) on Thursday warned devotees of the Black Nazarene of the risk of stampedes in crowded areas during the Traslacion or the procession of the image of Jesus in Manila.\nIn a statement, the Health department said large gatherings, especially in narrow streets and densely packed areas, “increase the danger of stampede incidents, which can lead to injuries or fatalities,” sharing common signs such as strong pushing from the crowd, sudden and simultaneous movement of people, difficulty lifting one’s feet, and trouble breathing.\nMeanwhile, the Philippine National Police (PNP) said its personnel will observe maximum tolerance for the devotees ahead of the Black Nazarene’s feast day on Friday.\n“My directive to our police is maximum tolerance, professionalism, and respect for religious activities,” PNP acting chief Police Lieutenant General Jose Melencio Nartatez Jr. said in a statement.\nNartatez also noted the “clear crowd control measures, designated entry and exit points, and close coordination” with the Quiapo Church, the Manila city government, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), and medical teams.\nHealth Assistant Secretary Gloria Balboa previously urged the public to prioritize health and safety, and if possible, children, pregnant women, senior citizens, those with compromised immune systems, and those with illnesses should not attend the Traslacion.\nThe MMDA announced on Thursday its readiness for the Traslacion 2026, which is expected to be attended by millions of devotees.\nThe agency said it has implemented extensive safety measures and traffic management plans to ensure a smooth and secure experience for all participants. Road closures and traffic rerouting will be enforced before and during the religious activity, it added in a statement.\nLocal officials in Manila are also urging attendees to follow guidelines and remain vigilant throughout the event.\nMMDA Chairman Romando Artes and General Manager Nicolas Torre III inspected the Quirino Grandstand earlier in preparation for the Traslacion.\nThey also evaluated the operations of the Command Center and observed the flow of devotees participating in the “Pagpugay” to ensure order and safety in the vicinity.\nArtes and Torre also examined the agency’s assigned first aid stations, which are prepared to respond if necessary.\nThe MMDA Chairman said 354 of their personnel are currently deployed, with plans to increase this number to over a thousand by Thursday night.\nAdditional tents will also be erected to provide shelter for the devotees.\nTorre confirmed that 20 portable toilets have been set up at the Quirino Grandstand. He urged the public to stay hydrated, utilize clear bags, avoid crowded areas, and adhere to the established safety guidelines for everyone’s protection.\nThe MMDA also announced that the Pasig River Ferry Service will operate on a limited basis on Friday due to the enforcement of the No Sail Zone around Manila as part of the safety measures for the feast.\n“The trip will be from Guadalupe to PUP (Sta. Mesa) and from PUP to Kalawaan (vice versa) only,” the agency stated in its advisory.\nManila Mayor Isko Moreno thanked all partner agencies and reminded the public that the use of fireworks is strictly prohibited in the city during the Traslacion.\nHe also encouraged devotees to bring food, water, and any necessary medication to avoid any health problems.\nThe Saint John the Baptist Church and its partner agencies are also prepared to ensure the smooth and safe attendance of devotees.",
