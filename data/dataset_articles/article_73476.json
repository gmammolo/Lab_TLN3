  "text": "In my father’s living room over fifty years ago, as a young man, I first encountered these words of divine wisdom that have since been my guiding light. They remind us that we are creations of God and belong to Him, not to ourselves.\nAs you reflect on this week’s discussion, you may have encountered individuals in your life’s journey who, through their actions and treatment of others, behave as if they are the almighty creators of humanity. Powerful and influential figures often exhibit a sense of omnipotence, believing they are self-made and unaccountable. This mindset leads to the rampant embezzlement of national resources without remorse. When entrusted with power, these individuals become reckless and arrogant in their conduct, perpetrating evil deeds with impunity. Despite their misdeeds, they perceive God’s silence as a form of endorsement. However, God may remain silent, but He does not overlook the wrongdoing of men.\nThe practice of sowing seeds and reaping a harvest is not exclusive to any specific faith; it is a universal law. Every action has its consequences, and every individual will eventually face the repercussions of their behavior. Whether one remembers this fundamental truth or not, justice spares no one. Time is the ultimate revealer of our deeds.\nA Nigerian politician once attempted to enter the United States with a substantial sum of undeclared US dollars, claiming only a fraction of the actual amount in his possession. This deceptive act resulted in the confiscation of the money by US authorities, depriving Nigeria of vital resources that could have been used for societal development.\nThe narrative of corruption and theft in Nigeria remains prevalent, with perpetrators often evading punishment for their crimes. The ingrained culture of impunity around political power facilitates the perpetuation of these heinous acts, denying the country of much-needed progress and prosperity.\nWhile justice may elude the corrupt in human courts, the passage of time holds a different form of accountability that transcends mortal limitations. The day of reckoning will eventually arrive for those who exploit their positions for personal gain. Time will expose the truth of their actions.\nIn contrast to the leniency shown towards corrupt officials in Nigeria, countries like China and Vietnam have stringent laws that mandate severe consequences for embezzlement and corruption. While man may falter in delivering justice, the cosmic balance of time and destiny guarantees that wrongdoers will face the consequences of their actions.\nRegardless of how well they conceal themselves or their ill-gotten gains, evildoers cannot evade the reckoning that awaits them. The wheels of justice turn inexorably, and even the most powerful and affluent cannot escape the repercussions of their misdeeds. Time will uncover the seeds they have sown.",
