  "text": "Belarusian football coach converts to Islam to get married in Indonesia Aleg Kuzmianok / by.tribuna.com Aleg Kuzmianok, former head coach of the Haradzeya football club and assistant to Ihar Kriushenka in the Belarusian national team in 2017-2019, got a job in Malaysia this year. It is the academy of the club \"Kuching City\". At first, 49-year-old Kuzmianok worked with young boys, but in April the Belarusian was put the head coach of Kuching City U-23, [writes](https://by.tribuna.com/be/blogs/editors/3104284-ekstrener-sbornoj-belarusi-smenil-indoneziyu-na-malajziyu-a-ch/) Tribuna. The coach moved from Indonesia to Malaysia. In 2019-2021, Kriushenka coached the club Persikaba there, and Aleg Kuzmianok was on his staff. In order to get married in Indonesia, he converted to Islam. His wife is the daughter of a businessman. They have one child. This is the third marriage for the Belarusian coach. The last time he came to his homeland in 2022, \"to settle domestic and family issues\" (at that time he still had a legal wife in Belarus). Kuzmianok was dragged to Malaysia by coach Aidil Sharin, with whom they worked for a while. Since 2019, the Belarusian has never learned Indonesian, much less Malay. He also has problems with English. Therefore, they have to manage the team with the help of an interpreter. On May 21, Kuching City U-23 will play its first official match under his leadership. Kuzmianok is fully immersed in football, so he hasn't had time to move his family to Malaysia, the publication said.
