  "text": "To alleviate the burdens faced by pilgrims from Sokoto State at the ongoing Hajj in Saudi Arabia, Governor Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto has approved a gift of 1,000 Saudi Riyal for each pilgrim from the state.\nThe governor disclosed this information during the launch of this year’s pilgrim airlift from the Sultan Abubakar International Airport in Sokoto.\nAREWA PUNCH previously highlighted the grievances of Sokoto pilgrims who felt neglected by the state government due to reduced BTA allocations and increased travel costs compared to other states.\nThe Sokoto pilgrims had appealed to the state government for assistance, citing the sudden fare hike and BTA reduction by NAHCON.\nIn his address to the pilgrims before their departure, the governor announced the provision of 1,000 Saudi Riyal to each pilgrim to ensure a successful Hajj experience.\n“I am pleased to announce that each pilgrim from our state will receive a gift of 1,000 Saudi Riyal as a token of support and Goron Sallah.\n“This gift is intended to assist them during their sacred Hajj rituals. I pray that Allah grants our pilgrims good health and strength to fulfill their obligations with devotion.\n“I wish them a safe and smooth journey,” Aliyu Sokoto concluded his address.",
