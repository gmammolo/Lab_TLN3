  "text": "He understood warfare and fought spiritual enemies.\nHe dealt with Goliath;\nHe dealt with the Philistines;\nHe subjected all his enemies to shame;\nHe never lost battles;\nHe was the one who eventually captured Jerusalem when the people there were boasting that even if the lame and blind guide the city, it cannot be taken.\nHe entered through their waterways and captured the city. It is therefore spiritually beneficial to learn from his prayers to pick lessons.\nIt is time for you to begin to pray the aggressive prayer of the psalmist.\nWhen situations get to a level and they are mocking you, they are telling you to forsake Christ, they are telling you that you are useless, your mockers are more than your helpers, and it is calling for the aggressive prayer of the psalmist.\nThe coven that can withstand the aggressive prayer of the psalmist has not yet been created.\nI remember that our father in the Lord who has gone to be with the Lord now. He died at age 107.\nI went with him somewhere. They served us jollof-rice and fish. He said, Let us pray on the food, and we bowed our heads.\nHe read the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth psalms, and he was reading them in Yoruba on the food.\nThe food ran cold. Eventually, he finished the prayer. I could not eat. I was full of questions.\nI asked,_ Daddy, why did you have to read so many psalms before we could eat?”\nHe looked at me and said in Yoruba, you are a kid.”\nHe said that he came from a highly polygamous homes with plenty of wives. He said all the wives, including his own mother, were witches.\nAnd those were the people cooking their food. He was eating that food until he started primary 1 at the age of 17.\nHe said, “Young man, I will be praying n my food. That is the food that brought me to this level.\nHe knew the weapons. If not, his life would have been worse. Eventually, he went through school and became a man of God.\nThis is a very serious matter.\nBut the Christians of today are very lazy.\nThe great Apostle Babalola memorised all the psalms in his head, and that is where he used to take weapons from.\nWe are going to stop here today. We will continue this topic next time.\nPRAYER POINTS.\n1. Serpents and scorpions biting my destiny, die in the name of Jesus;\n2. Thunder of God arises; destroy the enemies of my next level, in the name of Jesus;\n3. Stubborn pursuers hear the word of the Lord, pursue yourselves in the name of Jesus.\nGod bless you and your family, in Jesus name, amen.",
