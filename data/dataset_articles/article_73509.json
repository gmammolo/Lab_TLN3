  "text": "Having a Buddha statue around your workplace or home will bring positivity to all the elements of your life, it has the power to strengthen all the weak elements and increase positivity in your life. Both Vastu and Feng Shui have a lot to say regarding the placement of the statue either at home or work. By adding a Buddha statue in our office or home, it not only adds a touch of elegance and aesthetics but also provides inner harmony, enlightenment and peace.The 8 Rules To Know Before Placing A Buddha Statue At Your Home Or OfficeAlways place the Buddha statue on a pedestal or an elevated area to show respect towards the idol.If you are placing the statue on a shelf, ensure it's not overcrowded with unwanted things and messy, allow the statue to stand out.The Buddha statue should be placed at a higher level than other significant items in the room to symbolize its importance.prevent energy blockages, and avoid placing the statue near a refrigerator or heavy storage cabinet.The Buddha's shrine and statue should face east to align with traditional practices and beliefs.Never keep a Buddha statue in the bedroom or bathroom, as these areas are considered inappropriate for spiritual items.Keep the area around the statue clean at all times and use candles or incense sticks to purify the air around the idol.Make sure the statue faces inside the room rather than outside, with the exception of the Laughing Buddha, which can be placed at the entryway to ward off negative energy.",
