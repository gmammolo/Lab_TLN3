  "text": "CNA Staff, Jun 2, 2024 / 08:15 am With school uniforms pressed, matching hair ribbons, and hands folded in prayer, hundreds of school children from the Diocese of Trenton greeted the most special guest imaginable: Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. Fresh off a trek across New Jersey, Jesus in the Eucharist arrived May 29 at St. Mary of the Pines Church in Manahawkin on the New Jersey shore as part of the National Eucharistic Pilgrimage for a day of adoration, a eucharistic procession and holy Mass celebrated by Bishop David O’Connell of the Diocese of Trenton. The diocesan event was designed especially to bring awareness to school children about the real presence of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. Jesus arrived accompanied by clergy, seminarians, and religious sisters, as well as five “Perpetual Pilgrims” — young adults who have put their lives on hold in order to share their love for Jesus in the Eucharist. They are processing with him for 65 straight days and 1,000 miles on the eastern St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Route of the National Eucharistic Pilgrimage, which began in New Haven, Connecticut.",
