  "text": "Kejriwal pays homage to Mahatma Gandhi, visits Hanuman temple\nIf you are happy then your Kejriwal will also be happy in jail. Jai Hind, says Delhi CM before leaving for Tihar\nDelhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal paid homage at Mahatma Gandhi's memorial at the Rajghat on Sunday, 2 June, his first place of visit before he surrenders at the Tihar Jail later in the day.\nKejriwal visited the Hanuman temple in Connaught Place and then addressed workers and leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) at its office on Rouse Avenue Road.\nAt the Rajghat, AAP national convenor Kejriwal was accompanied by his wife Sunita Kejriwal, party leaders, including Delhi ministers Atishi, Kailash Gahlot and Saurabh Bharadwaj, Rajya Sabha MPs Sanjay Singh and Sandeep Pathak, and leaders Durgesh Pathak, Rakhi Birla and Reena Gupta.\nThe chief minister reached the memorial around 3 pm.\nKejriwal was released from prison on 10 May on interim bail granted by the Supreme Court in a money laundering case linked to the alleged Delhi excise policy scam to campaign in the Lok Sabha polls.\nThe bail expired on 1 June, the day the seventh and last phase of the general elections was held.\nThe Delhi BJP staged a protest outside the Rajghat against Kejriwal. Members of the party were seen being detained by police.\nIn a post on X in Hindi, Kejriwal, earlier in the day, said, \"On orders of the honourable Supreme Court, I came out from prison for election campaign for 21 days. Many thanks to the honourable Supreme Court.\"\n\"Today I will go to Tihar and surrender. I will leave home at 3 pm. First, I will go to Rajghat and pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi. From there, I will go to Hanuman Temple in Connaught Place to seek blessings of Hanuman ji. And from there, I will go to the party office and meet with workers and party leaders. From there, I will leave for Tihar,\" the chief minister said.\n\"All of you take care of yourselves. I will be worried about you. If you are happy then your Kejriwal will also be happy in jail. Jai Hind,\" he added.\nFollow us on:\nGoogle News,\nJoin our official telegram channel (\n@nationalherald) and stay updated with the latest headlines",
