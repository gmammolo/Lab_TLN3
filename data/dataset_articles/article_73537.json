  "text": "NEW DELHI: Amit Panghal, the silver medallist at the World Championships, and national champion Jaismine Lamboria secured their spots in the Paris Olympics with contrasting quarterfinal victories at the 2nd World Qualification Tournament. Panghal's return to the Indian team culminated in the fifth Olympic quota in boxing, as the multiple-time Asian Championships medallist secured a hard-fought 5-0 win over China's Chuang Liu for a ticket to his second Games.— OlympicKhel (@OlympicKhel) Jaismine, after dropping down from 60kg, reclaimed the women's 57kg quota for India, which had to be forfeited after holder Parveen Hooda was suspended for a whereabouts failure last month. Jaismine dominated her quarterfinal bout, out-punching Marine Camara of Mali in a lopsided contest.Jaismine's qualification adds to the list of Indian boxers who have booked their berths for the Olympics. She joins the ranks of Nishant Dev (71kg), Nikhat Zareen (50kg), Preeti Pawar (54kg), and Lovlina Borgohain (75kg), along with Panghal.Panghal's journey to Paris wasn't easy, as he lost his place in the national team to world championship bronze medallist Deepak Bhoria based on the Boxing Federation of India's evaluation system for the earlier two qualifying events. However, he made the most of his opportunity in this tournament. Since the Tokyo Olympics, Panghal has competed in the Commonwealth Games, where he won gold, and the Strandja Memorial tournament, where he emerged victorious earlier this year. Panghal and Jaismine's qualification for the Paris Olympics not only demonstrates their skill in the ring but also emphasizes the depth of talent within Indian boxing. The blend of seasoned veterans and promising newcomers makes India's boxing team a formidable force for the upcoming Olympics.Their journey to Olympic qualification highlights the resilience and determination needed to overcome obstacles in the sporting world. Their success stands as a source of inspiration for aspiring boxers throughout India, reinforcing the nation's position in the global boxing landscape.With the Paris Olympics approaching, Panghal, Jaismine, and their fellow qualifiers will focus on refining their training regimes, aiming to secure podium finishes on the world's biggest stage.(Inputs from PTI)",
