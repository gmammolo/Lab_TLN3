  "text": "Memorial Day is the unofficial “launch” of summer and Dan’s Taste events, and the season began with a roar of a different kind: a celebration filled with laughter, dining, drinking and dancing at our annual Rose Soirée sponsored by Wilmington Trust at the prestigious Southampton Arts Center on Jobs Lane. Over 800 happy people joined us at the iconic event that my daughter Elizabeth Aloni and her talented team brought to life with great success! A bonus was when my other children, Josh and Samantha and their children joined me the next day to share a lobster bake and a day of togetherness! It doesn’t get better than this! Here’s to a great season of shared good times and memories! See more photos on Schneps Media’s Thought of the Week Happiness is a journey, not a destination. Work like you don’t need money. Love like you’ve never been hurt. And dance like no one’s looking. — Dalai Lama Love to you, my dear readers.",
