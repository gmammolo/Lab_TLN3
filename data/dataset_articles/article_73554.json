  "text": "A Nashville church will hold a “Spirituality Night” during June’s LGBT Pride festivities.\nOn June 12, the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Nashville will host the event .\n“We gather to create community, nurture spiritual growth, and act on our values. Together, guided by reason and inspired by love, we celebrate diversity, confront oppression, and promote environmental and social justice,” says a mission statement on the church’s website.\nThe church professes Jewish and Christian theology but also “spiritual teachings of earth-centered traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature” and “humanist teachings which counsel us to heed the guidance of reason and the results of science, and warn us against idolatries of the mind and spirit.”\nNashville Pride has a slew of events lined up for June, including a “Pride Turnabout.”\nThe flyer for that event says, “See your favorite Nashville Pride community members all dragged up performing to support Nashville Pride.”\nThe group will also hold a Pride Pageant, which will include three divisions:\nMs. Nashville Pride: The Ms. Nashville Pride division is appropriate for individuals whose stage persona identifies as female, regardless of gender identity. Mr. Nashville Pride : The Mr. Nashville Pride division is appropriate for individuals whose stage persona identifies as male, regardless of gender identity. MX. Nashville Pride : The MX Nashville Pride division is appropriate for individuals whose stage persona identifies as non-binary and/or gender diverse, regardless of gender identity. Contestants are assured that the pageant’s judges do not “discriminate against entertainers with silicone and hormone use” and note that “the use of silicone and/or hormones will not be considered by any judge in scoring contestants.”\nAs reported by The Tennessee Star Thursday, a group called “Chattanooga Youth Pride” will hold a drag show for children during Pride Month.\n“The highlight of the event, there’s a stage set up for live performances by talented LGBTQ+ youth artists, including singers, dancers, poets, and drag performers,” says an online invite to the event. “The performances showcase the diversity and creativity of the community, while spreading messages of love, acceptance, and pride.”\n– – –\nPete D’Abrosca is a reporter at The Tennessee Star and The Star News Network .
