  "text": "Union Minister Sitharaman shares PM Modi's note after meditation at Vivekananda Rock Memorial U nion Minister and BJP leader Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday shared a note by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, written after his meditation session at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari. In his note, PM Modi wrote, \"It is my fortune that today, after so many years, as India embodies the values and ideals of Swami Vivekananda, I too have had the opportunity to meditate at this sacred place.\" \"My meditation at this 'Shila Smarak' is one of the unforgettable moments of my life. Sitting at the feet of 'Ma Bharati', I once again reaffirm my resolve that every moment of my life and every particle of my body will always be dedicated to the service of the nation,\" PM wrote in the note. \"With wishes for the progress of the nation and the welfare of its citizens, I offer my utmost reverence to 'Ma Bharati',\" PM Modi wrote. The Prime Minister was on a spiritual sojourn from May 30 evening to June 1 evening, for nearly 45 hours. He meditated through day and night at the same place where Swami Vivekananda did meditation, at the Dhyan Mandapam. He was meditating at the Dhyan Mandapam, where Hindu philosopher Swami Vivekananda is believed to have had a divine vision about 'Bharat Mata'. This coincides with the conclusion of polling for the final phase of Lok Sabha polls. Notably, Prime Minister Modi concluded his election campaign in Punjab's Hoshiarpur on Thursday, for the final phase of the general elections, which will be held on June 1. The Prime Minister held around 206 election campaign events, including rallies and roadshows, in 75 days. He also did around 80 interviews with different news and media platforms. The Prime Minister is known to undertake spiritual journeys at the end of election campaigns. In 2019, he visited Kedarnath, and in 2014, he visited Shivaji's Pratapgarh. Today marks the seventh and final phase of the Lok Sabha election, which commenced on April 19. The counting of the votes will be held on June 4. ✔️ Union Minister Sitharaman shares PM Modi's note after meditation at Vivekananda Rock Memorial 💕 Found this article helpful?
