  "text": "Siddipet: Telangana formation day was organised on a grand note in the Siddipet district on Sunday. The BRS leaders offered prayers at Martyr’s memorial located at Rangadhampally near Siddipet where Former Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao launched his hunger fast in 2009, which paved way for the formation of the State.\nBRS leaders led by Farooq Hussain, Kadavergu Rajanarasu, Pala Sairam, Macha Venugopal Reddy and others have offered floral tributes at Martyr’s memorial remembering the sacrifices of the Telangana Martyrs.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Former MLC Farooq Hussain has said that every citizen of Telangana had participated in the 14-day struggle under the leadership of Chandrashekhar Rao.
