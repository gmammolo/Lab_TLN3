Watch A Russian vlogger recently visited Mumbai&#039;s Siddhivinayak temple and took to social media to share her experience. Mariia Chugurova narrated her experience of visiting the iconic shrine in an Instagram video, referring to the visit as &quot;a truly special day&quot;. &quot;Namaste dosto. Today was a truly special day as I had the opportunity to visit one of Mumbai’s most revered and iconic landmarks: The Siddhi Vinayak Temple,&quot; the vlogger wrote in the caption. Detailing her experience of visiting the temple, the vlogger spoke about how all the devotees moved very quickly and admitted that the feeling of visiting the temple as one that was hard to explain. &quot;Today I’m coming to the most famous temple in Mumbai, Siddhivinayak.&quot; &quot;Even when it’s so crowded, so many people, everybody pushing you, everybody trying to move you because you need to do this very fast. But you still have such a blessed feeling. You can’t explain this,&quot; she said in the video. The vlogger further said that while joining the queue of devotees, she could feel &quot;a profound sense of connection&quot; with everyone around her. &quot;The energy within the temple was palpable, and the sense of community was heartwarming. It was a reminder of the power of faith and the unifying force of shared beliefs. Joining the long queue of devotees, I felt a profound sense of connection with everyone around me, each person carrying their hopes, dreams, and prayers.&quot; &quot;I left the temple with a heart full of blessings and a mind at peace, grateful for the experience and the chance to be part of something so timeless and beautiful!&quot; she added in the caption.",
