  "text": "Media Release Moodbidri, June 2: The Corpus Christi Church celebrated the solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Jesus Christ with a grand ceremony. The event commenced with the Holy Eucharistic Mass at 7:30 am, presided over by Fr Onil D’Souza and Fr Gilbert D’Souza. The parish council members organised the liturgy with the support of the Corpus Christi church choir, ensuring a harmonious and reverent atmosphere. During his homily, Fr Gilbert D’Souza reflected on the significance of the last supper and Christ's ultimate sacrifice. He emphasised how Jesus, from his birth to his death, offered himself as a living sacrifice, culminating in his crucifixion. Fr Gilbert exhorted the congregation to emulate Jesus' selflessness and to live in peace and harmony with those around them. He shared anecdotes of individuals who exemplified a faithful life, inspiring the attendees to deepen their commitment to their faith. Following the Holy Eucharistic Mass, a street procession of the blessed sacrament took place. The blessed sacrament was carried on a decorative vehicle, accompanied by a children's band and many the faithful led by the clergy. This procession wound through the streets of Moodbidri, serving as a public demonstration of faith and a call for divine blessings for the city and its residents. Upon returning to the church, the parishioners participated in the benediction, a rite that concluded the solemn celebration. The celebration concluded with a simple breakfast served to all parishioners, furthering the spirit of fellowship and communal harmony. The event was marked by its devotional fervour and the active participation of the church community, reflecting their deep faith and commitment. The solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ, also known as Corpus Christi, is a significant feast in the Catholic Church, celebrating the real presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist. The celebrations at Corpus Christi Church, Moodbidri, highlighted the importance of this feast and brought the community together in a shared expression of faith and devotion.
