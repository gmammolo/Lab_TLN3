  "text": "Belfast Cathedral is celebrating 120 years of worship within its walls This weekend Belfast Cathedral will celebrate 120 years of worship within its walls with two special services - reminiscent of the grand opening service which saw thousands gather inside and outside St Anne’s on that day in 1904. At the Consecration of the Nave, 198 clergy from the dioceses of Down, Dromore and Connor were in attendance, along with bishops, civic dignitaries, and the general public, all decked out in their best attire. The service was led by the Rt Rev Dr Wellar, Bishop of Down, Dromore and Connor, and the £3,000 offering (which today equates to £406,000) is indicative of the value the people of Belfast placed upon the new Cathedral they had seen rise before their eyes. READ MORE: Belfast Cathedral celebrating the past and planning for the future 120 years on Over a four-year period, the Nave had been built around the old parish church of St Anne - worship continuing in the small church as the walls of the new rose up outside. The old church was then demolished, giving way to the new St Anne’s - the first cathedral to have been planned and built by the Church of Ireland since Disestablishment in 1870. The site in Donegall Street was a gift to the town of Belfast by its landlord, Lord Donegall. The small parish church of St Anne had been consecrated in 1776, and in 1895, the project to build a Cathedral for Belfast was launched. The architects were both Belfast men, Thomas Drew, who provided the plans, and WH Lynn. Belfast's Protestant (Church of Ireland) cathedral was built between 1899 and 1904. The foundation stone was laid on September 6th 1899. Services continued in the original St Anne’s until the end of 1903, when the church was no longer visible from the street! The only feature of the old St Anne’s to remain in the present-day Cathedral is the Good Samaritan Window. The west front was designed by Sir Charles Archibald Nicholson and was built as a memorial to the men and women of Ulster who served and died in the First World War. It was completed in 1927. The Nave was the first part of the building to be constructed. New sections were completed over time: The Crypt 1922-24; West Front 1925-27; Baptistry 1928; Chapel of the Holy Spirit 1932; Apse and Ambulatory 1959; Transepts 1974 and 1981. The final piece, the stainless steel Spire of Hope, was lowered into place in 2007. In its 120-year history since it was completed, momentous moments in Irish history have taken place at St Anne's — partition and Edward Carson, who masterminded the Ulster Covenant in response to the Irish nationalist campaign for Home Rule, remains to be the only person buried in the Cathedral; the Belfast Blitz, which saw the building narrowly miss destruction, and the Troubles.
