  "text": "On Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari, where he will engage in meditation from this morning until the evening of June 1. It is noteworthy that PM Modi will be meditating day and night in the Dhyan Mandapam, the same location where Swami Vivekanand once meditated. Following the conclusion of the Lok Sabha election campaign, Prime Minister Modi said prayers at the Bhagavathy Amman Temple in Kanyakumari earlier in the day. The prime minister was spotted with an off-white shawl covering his upper torso while donning a dhoti. In Hoshiarpur, Punjab, on Thursday, Prime Minister Modi wrapped up his campaign for the general elections that will take place on June 1. As the Bharatiya Janata Party prepares to enter its third term of government, Prime Minister Modi has travelled the entire nation in support of his partys candidature. Over the course of 75 days, the prime minister conducted about 206 election-related events, such as roadshows and rallies. Additionally, he had almost 80 interviews for various news and media outlets. The rock located at the memorial location had a significant influence on Swami Vivekanandas life. It is thought that this rock had a comparable significance in Swami Vivekanandas life to that of Sarnath in Gautam Buddhas. After travelling the entire nation and engaging in mediation for three days, he arrived here and gained a vision of an advanced India. Legend has it that Goddess Parvati likewise stood on one foot and concentrated there as she awaited Lord Shiva. This is Indias southernmost point. Moreover, this location unites the Eastern and Western coasts of India. Additionally, it is where the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Indian Ocean converge. By visiting Kanyakumari, PM Modi is demonstrating his support for national unity. It is well known that the Prime Minister embarks on spiritual pilgrimages following electoral campaigns. He travelled to Kedarnath in 2019 and Shivajis Pratapgarh in 2014. Commencing on April 19, the election for 543 Lok Sabha seats is being conducted in seven stages. June 4 is when the votes will be tallied. (With Inputs from PTI)",
