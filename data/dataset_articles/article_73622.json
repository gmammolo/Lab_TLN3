  "text": "St. Augustine said, “The confession of evil works is the first beginning of good works.” Pretending to be perfect is exhausting, but when we understand we’re all sinners in need of a Savior, that’s when true life-change begins. As believers, our goal should be to live with integrity, understanding that it’s not about perfect actions, but a perfect heart—one that remains set on God. Proverbs 10:9 (ESV) says, “Whoever walks in integrity walks securely…” We see this in the life of King David. God called David a man after His own heart, but he was far from perfect. His life proves four realities about integrity. First, it shows that integrity begins when we root ourselves in God’s truth. David was born into an underprivileged family, but he became the King of Israel, taking it from the most oppressed nation to the most blessed nation of the region. How did he do this? And why did God choose him? Because David valued God’s wisdom. In Psalm 25:5 he wrote: “Guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are God my Savior, and my hope is in you all day long.” When we also root ourselves in God’s truth, we will begin walking in integrity. Then, David’s life proved that integrity continues as we rely on God’s trustworthiness. At one point, David grew so discouraged by his trouble that he made a series of terrible decisions. He had an affair with Bathsheba, his military leader’s wife, and then had him killed. David knew he was wrong, and he repented. God, true to His nature, was merciful. While David still had to face the consequences of his actions because he relied on God’s trustworthiness, he was able to continue on the path of integrity. (2 Samuel 11-12) It’s the same for us. When we fail, we must trust in the mercy of our Savior, and allow Him to lead us back to His path. Next, David’s life shows that integrity remains tenacious in trials. David’s consequence for his sin was the life of the son Bathsheba conceived in the affair. David fasted and prayed for their son to live, but he died. After God made His answer clear, David was heartbroken, but he didn’t pout or blame God. Instead, he worshipped. He focused on the goodness of God. (2 Samuel 12:20) Throughout our lives, we too will face trial, whether it’s because of our actions, or simply because we live in a fallen world. When we do, we also must prove tenacious, fixing our focus on God’s goodness. The last thing David’s life shows us is that integrity always resolves to try again. David grew from his mistakes, and 2 Samuel 12:24-25 tells us God granted David and Bathsheba another son who later became the wisest king to ever live. Friends, integrity leads to security, every time. We won’t be perfect, but if we’ll continually set our heart on God, we will walk in His blessing!",
