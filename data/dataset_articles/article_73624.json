  "text": "Gil Shapiro's opinion piece in Sunday's paper says, \"Reason: the power of comprehending, inferring, or thinking, in orderly rational ways...stands in strong opposition to faith.\" I was a math major in college and have an orderly rational mind. As a way to relax, I work logic puzzles. I am also a woman of deep faith. As a teacher of math and religion, I saw no conflict between rational thinking and living by faith. Shapiro calls faith an imposter for not delivering what it promises. He doesn't understand that people pray not to change God's mind, but because they understand prayer changes them. He also says, \"Ask faith-based thinkers if they ever doubt their deeply held beliefs...The answer will surely be 'No'.\" Of course we have doubts! We also have the peace that comes with the ability to believe beyond understanding. I remember the quote I posted in my math classroom many years ago: \"Life is not a problem to be solved, but a mystery to be lived.\" People are also reading… Sister Karen Berry, OSF Midtown Disclaimer: As submitted to the Arizona Daily Star.",
