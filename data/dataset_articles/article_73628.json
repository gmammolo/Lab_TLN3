  "text": "By Aria Brent\nAFRO Staff Writer\nabrent@afro.com\nRev. Jamal Bryant announces his engagement to fellow pastor Karri Turner on social media via a livestream of his sermon on May 26, 2024. CREDIT: Unsplash.com / Alekon Pictures Congratulations are in order for Rev. Jamal Bryant and Rev. Dr. Karri Turner, as the two are now engaged to be married. The couple announced their engagement on social media via a video that was shot during Sunday service at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church on May 26, where Bryant currently serves as senior pastor.\nIn the video, shared by Bryant on Instagram, he is seen explaining his decision to propose to Turner before bringing her out on stage.\n“Sometimes your blessings will be right in front of your eyes and you don’t even know what God’s got for you. an amazingly beautiful woman, an amazingly brilliant woman. Last year she graduated with her doctorate degree” he recalled. “As I saw her walk across that stage and get her degree the Lord said ‘You big dummy, what are you waiting on?’”\nCongregation members stood and cheered as Bryant continued to gush over his now fiance, noting how special she is to him.\n “She makes me a better man. I wanted to marry her because I wanted her to be the moon, because I don’t want there to be a night that I don’t see her,” declared Bryant. “I wanted her to be the sun, to be a reminder that the dark season of my life is over. I wanted her to be a rainbow, just to be a reminder that God’s promise is still good for my life. I wanted her to be the rain to let me know that the harvest is coming.”\n“For five years you’ve just had a pastor– but going forward for the rest of my days you’re going to have a first lady.”\nSince December of 2018, Bryant has been the senior pastor at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church. He was previously married to reality television star Gizelle Bryant, of Bravo’s “The Real Housewives of Potomac,” from 2002 to 2009.”",
