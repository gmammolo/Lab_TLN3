  "text": "The Qatari Haj Mission has arranged camps with highest level of facilities for pilgrims from the country. Haj tour operators told local Arabic daily Arrayah that the camps in both Mina and Arafat have five-star amenities. The Qatari Haj Mission is expected to open these camps for the pilgrims on Dhul-Hijjah 1. The tour operators are making the final arrangements to facilitate the travel to Makkah. Most of the operators, according to the reports, have handed over tickets to the pilgrims and held meetings to introduce the customs and rituals of Haj to the pilgrims. The pilgrims have taken vaccines and completed paying the fees electronically to complete the travel proceedings. The Ministry of Endowments (Awqaf) and Islamic Affairs has said that various units of the Qatari Haj Mission have started working to ensure that the pilgrims perform Haj with ease. The mission is supported by several units that provide qualitative services to the country’s pilgrims. These include Sharia, medical, information systems and communication units along with a support centre. Also, there are units of control and inspection, logistics services, co-ordination, follow-up and airport. The public relations and media unit also works with the mission. The Medical Unit is working to provide the necessary health care to the pilgrims in Makkah. A specialised team of doctors will accompany the pilgrims from Qatar. The unit will provide all the necessary capabilities, equipment, medicines and treatments for Qatari pilgrims with specialised doctors, nurses, paramedics and pharmacists accompanying the Qatari Haj delegation. To provide high-level health services that guarantee the safety and health of the country’s pilgrims the team will work in co-operation with the Ministry of Public Health, Hamad Medical Corporation and the Primary Health Care Corporation. The Co-ordination, Follow-up and Airport Unit at Qatari Haj Mission is making the final preparations to ensure the travel procedures of the pilgrims from Qatar are completed smoothly.
