  "text": "HIGHLAND — Lucius, a ball python, slithered around Father Gregory Bim-Merle's shoulders as he blessed pets. The pet blessing ceremony was held at 6 p.m. at Highland's community garden. Five dogs were blessed. Normally the priest only blesses pets in October for the Feast Day of St. Francis Assisi. Bim-Merle said the dogs there were the best behaved ones he had ever blessed. The ceremony was complete with a splash of holy water on each animal. Afterwards, people mingled for a bit in the garden and picked radishes and strawberries. Renee Reinhart started the garden after she got the idea during a conference. She did her research and presented her idea at a town meeting. Highland is the only town in the area, other than Cedar Lake, to have a garden like this. People are also reading… \"I wanted to bring a little bit of agriculture back and be able to educate our kids where this comes from and how we can grow healthy food in our backyard,\" Reinhart said. All she needed to start was a plot of land with access to water. The land right next to the fire station was not able to be developed so it was perfect for the garden and they are able to use water from the fire station, Reinhart said. To start the garden she got a lot of help from volunteers, especially from the Highland Neighbors for Sustainability. At first there were a lot of false rumors that the town would have to pay for the garden. The garden is completely sponsored by donations from businesses and the local community, Reinhart said. They also let local business take any herbs they need. For example, Fuzzyline Brewing Co. would take basil for basil beer. They ask for people to donate \"veggie bucks.\" Through the two farms left in Highland, Zandstra's Farm and Scheeringa Farms, the garden can then turn in the veggie bucks to get plants to plant in the garden beds. The garden focuses on bringing the community together but also on giving back. They donate their vegetables to the St. James food pantry. The garden has a policy, \"Take what you need, help pick a weed.\" Soon they will also have a free little pantry by the road in front of the garden. It will essentially be a box with nonperishables that people in need can take, along with fresh produce. Right now the garden is working on getting some more items for the garden, such as large pots and buckets, hoses and garden vouchers. Reinhart said she wants more events like the pet blessing to take place in the garden. She said they could do yoga, a dinner or even host an orchestra in the garden. \"Really, my passion is to to grow fruit, food so that we have a sense of community pride, and to be able to give back to people in need,\" Reinhart said.",
