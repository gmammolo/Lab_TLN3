  "text": "Hare Krishna, We will proceed on our journey with the 13th verse of the third chapter from Bhagavad Gita. As it is, the Sanskrit verse is as follows. Yagyashista shinhasanto munchante sarvakil bishaye bhunjate TE toa gham Papa. The English translation is as follows. The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment verily eat only sin. If you observe the verse, it says Yadge shishta which means remnants and ashina means to eat or accept. Santo means devotees and munchate Sarabhakil Bisha in which munchate means liberated and kilbishe means all the contaminations. So by taking remnants of yagya, saintly persons become free from all sinful reactions. Munjete tohum Papa in which Agham means the sin. So who are the sinners? The sinners are yeh pachante aat makaranat, those who cook for aat makaranat for their own purpose. So those who try to eat food for their own purpose, they consume sin only. The point is that in all the cultures there has traditionally been some form of acknowledgement that we should offer prayers to the higher being. For example, Christians may offer grace by folding their hands and praying, thanking God for providing food. Similarly, in different religions, there are various traditions that we recognize the food we receive as a provision from higher beings, not solely the result of our own efforts. While our efforts are important, they are not all important. When we offer food to Krishna, we acknowledge that we lack the capacity to produce food on our own. By recognizing that Krishna has provided the food, we express our gratitude. By offering food to Krishna, then accepting it, we acknowledge His mercy. Through this acknowledgement and the devotional connection it establishes, Krishna frees us from the sinful reactions. Yagya shishta shina Santa. Now someone may say that we are vegetarian and it is enough. Vegetarianism is important, but it is not all important. Vegetarianism alone will not free us from all sinful reactions, nor does it purify us completely. It does minimize the sinful reactions we incur and reduces the significant amount of violence that is occurring today. However, the important point is that even if the food is vegetarian, one is still eating sin if it is not offered to Krishna. Bhunjate TE togham Tata. So therefore, as a devotee, it is crucial for us to offer the food to Krishna and then accepting it as a reciprocation, as a mercy from Krishna. Thank you. We will discuss the 14th verse in the next episode. Hare Krishna.",
