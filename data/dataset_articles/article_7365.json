  "text": "SALT LAKE CITY ( ABC4 ) — Police are responding to a shooting near 660 N Redwood Road and have closed Redwood Road to traffic. They have confirmed multiple individuals were injured and two died as a result of the injuries.\nAs of 9:50 p.m., it appears that police have taken someone into custody. Law enforcement confirmed that they have detained individuals but could not confirm how many were detained at this time. ABC4’s Bayan Wang captured the following images.\nArrest made outside Church Meetinghouse/KTVX Arrest made outside Church Meetinghouse/KTVX Arrest made outside Church Meetinghouse/KTVX Arrest made outside Church Meetinghouse/KTVX ABC4 has also acquired footage from a neighbor in the area of 660 N Redwood Road in which you can hear gunshots, shortly before law enforcement responded to a church for a shooting.\nCase details Salt Lake City Police Department PIO Glen Mills confirmed that around 7:36 p.m., a call came in about a shooting at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints meetinghouse. There was a funeral taking place at the meetinghouse, and an altercation broke out, leading to shots being fired.\nAccording to Mills, there are at least eight victims, two of whom died as a result of their injuries. Three are also in critical condition, and three individuals are in unknown condition. Some of the victims were taken via private vehicle to the hospital, which Mills says has complicated the situation.\nBrian Redd, the Salt Lake City Chief of Police, confirmed that all victims are adults.\nPolice are actively looking for at least one suspect, who fled the scene, and have established a search area from 500 north to 700 north. Mills says there is an active manhunt, and they are still determining exactly how many suspects were involved.\nAdditionally, Redd says that law enforcement is pulling surveillance footage from nearby businesses and residents as part of their investigation. Additionally, at this time, they are asking the public to call 801-799-3000 if they have any information.\nChief Redd also confirmed that Metro Gang Unit detectives are on scene, but they cannot confirm if it is a gang-related incident at this time. Preliminary evidence reportedly indicates that it was not a random shooting but does not appear to be targeted towards any religion.\nLaw enforcement has also said there doesn’t appear to be an active threat to the public.\nPublic reactions Notably, police confirmed that the shooting took place during a funeral that was being held at the Church meetinghouse, with many attendees already grieving. ABC4 spoke with some of the attendees and bystanders who witnessed the shooting.\nBystanders react to shooting during funeral at LDS church that killed two “I still have my family in the church, and they won’t let us leave, because the whole back of the church is a crime scene,” said one of the attendees, who was the cousin of the deceased.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints released a statement on the shooting, extending prayers for the tragedy. Their full statement can be read here .\nAdditionally, SLC Mayor Erin Mendenhall shared condolences for the families of those impacted by the shooting, adding that it never should have happened outside of a place of worship. Other officials are also sharing their condolences, which can be read here .\nAdd as preferred source on Google",
