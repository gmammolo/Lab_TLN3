He underscored that failure to support this principle constitutes a violation of the constitution, emphasising that all MPs are obligated to uphold and protect the Constitution.\nThe President emphasised the need for acknowledgment that the executive, the constitution and the judiciary, as the three branches of government, should prioritize the Buddhist doctrine within the country. He emphasised that failure to support this principle constitutes a violation of the constitution, emphasising the obligation of all Members of Parliament to protect it.\nThe President highlighted that the constitution of this country outlines people’s sovereignty, prioritisation of Buddhism and preservation of territorial integrity as its core principles. He stressed the importance of consistently advancing while safeguarding these principles, emphasising that any opposition to them constitutes a breach of the constitution.\nAdditionally, the President shared that he was entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing the treatment of a critically ill patient. He noted that the patient, who was on the brink of death, is now showing gradual signs of recovery.

The construction of this Gurudev Suva Arana Gilan Bhikshu Centre has been accomplished through the labour contributions of the Sri Lanka Army, supported by both local and international donors.\nVenerable Bhikkuni Neunghaeng, the Chief of the Buddhist hospital in Ulsan, South Korea, and SinDaw, a Bhikkuni Kaushon from the Long Fong Monastery in Taiwan, have generously contributed to the medical equipment of this facility. Their contributions were made in response to an invitation extended by Venerable Katuwana Wijithawansa, Sri Lankaramadhipathi, Hethu, South Korea.\nThe President, after unveiling the plaque and inaugurating the Gurudev Suva Arana Gilan Bhikshu Centre, proceeded to conduct an inspection tour of the facility.\nDuring the ceremony, homage was paid to the current Chief incumbent of Sri Dhathumaluwa Viharaya Kohuwala Venerable Pitigala Sonuttara Nayaka Thera, for his national and religious service. Furthermore, acknowledgment was extended to him for his dedication to establishing the Gurudev Suva Arana Gilan Bhikshu Centre, catering to monks both domestically and internationally.
