  "text": "NORTHIRON Church hosts 4th annual Serve Day MARQUETTE, Mich. (WLUC) - Volunteers cleared bushes for the fourth annual NORTHIRON Church Serve Day on Sunday. Instead of a Sunday service, members helped local organizations. The church expected close to 400 people at four different locations. A team of four families cleaned up the Marquette Women’s Center parking lot. Serve Day Team Leader Kyle Monroe said the Women’s Center has tried to get someone to clear it before, but plans fell through. Kids handled smaller tasks like clearing sticks and dusting. Monroe hoped to serve the community as best as they could. “It’s just a beautiful place to live, and we need to keep it that way,” Monroe said. “And if we don’t serve, there’s just too much work to be done.” Another team planted new flowers for a Marquette City flower planter. The team of three pulled weeds and added new compost. “The church is not just a building, it’s the people inside of it,” Serve Day Team Leader Lauren Spranger said. “So, we’re taking the people inside the church, and hopefully, we’re always giving back to the community, but we’re taking a day to do it.” Spranger hopes to be part of Serve Day next year.
