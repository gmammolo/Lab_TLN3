  "text": "Just three days after a 27-year-old man died after falling from the Wazirpur flyover in northwest Delhi, another accident at the same spot has left a 24-year-old man critically injured. The two back-to-back incidents have raised serious questions about safety on the flyover. The latest accident happened on Tuesday evening when Ritik, a resident of Rajouri Garden, fell from the flyover after his motorcycle reportedly slipped. The incident took place around 8 PM as he was travelling from Pitampura towards Punjabi Bagh. Police said they received a PCR call at Keshavpuram police station reporting that a man had fallen from a height after an accident on the flyover. When officers reached the spot, they found Ritik badly injured and rushed him to Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital. Ritik later told police that his motorcycle, which he said was moving at a high speed, slipped while taking a turn. The bike then went through a gap between two lanes of the flyover, causing him to fall onto the road below. Police are now checking whether a fault in the flyover’s design or structure played a role in both accidents. A case of negligence has been registered in connection with Sunday’s incident, and officials said the agency responsible for the flyover would be asked to carry out an inspection. A senior police officer pointed out the dangers faced by two-wheeler riders at the location. After inspecting the site following Sunday’s fatal accident, police found that proper safety barriers were missing between the two lanes of the flyover. The gap between them was about one foot wide, with only a short wall and an iron railing on either side, both less than three feet high. Police said the height difference between the flyover and the road below ranges from 12 to 15 feet, making any fall from that point extremely dangerous. They have recommended the installation of stronger barriers and speed breakers to stop vehicles from going over the edge. On Sunday, 27-year-old Sourabh died after falling through the same gap while returning from a New Year’s party in Rohini with his friend Priyanka, 30. While Priyanka was found injured on the flyover near their damaged scooter, Sourabh was found below the flyover and was declared dead at a hospital. The repeated accidents have led to renewed calls for urgent safety measures at the flyover to prevent further loss of life.",
