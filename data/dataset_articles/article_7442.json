  "text": "Three-year old drowns after falling into uncovered water tank\nIndore: A 3-year-old boy drowned after accidentally falling into a water tank outside his maternal grandparents' house in Manorama Ganj area under Palasia police station limits in Indore. The accident occurred on Tuesday evening.\nACP Tushar Singh said that the deceased was identified as Ganesh. On Tuesday evening, his mother Manisha was inside the house preparing tea when Ganesh, who was playing, went outside without anyone noticing. When he did not return for a long time, the family began to search for him.\nAfter some time, the child was found drowned in a nearly 7-feet-deep water tank located outside the house. He was immediately taken out and rushed to the hospital, where doctors declared him dead.\nFamily members said that the water tank in the building was usually left uncovered. Ganesh's grandparents work as caretakers in a residential building and were away on duty at the owner's bungalow when the accident took place. His maternal uncle was at work, while the aunt was inside another room of the house.\nRelatives shared that Manisha was married in Burhanpur but lived with her parents in Indore for the past one-and-a-half years due to marital disputes with her husband Sunil. Ganesh was the only brother to his three sisters, who are currently with their father in Burhanpur.\nPolice have registered a case.",
