  "text": "By Frank Recchia ,\n3 hours ago\nFive cottages were damaged after a fire broke out on Shoreline Drive in Stratford early Wednesday morning.\nFire Chief Jermaine Atkinson says crews received multiple calls around 3 a.m. for a cottage fire.\nWhen they arrived, several cottages were already burning.\nAtkinson says windy conditions caused the flames to spread from one unit to another.\nOne person was inside a cottage and self-evacuated.\n\"When you get a call like this, and you have this many residences involved, we felt it was best to call the State Police to assist the Stratford Fire Marshal's office in order to find the cause of the fire, in the best way possible,\" Atkinson said.\nNo injuries were reported.\nAtkinson says firefighters worked to save the cottages and limit the damage as much as possible.",
