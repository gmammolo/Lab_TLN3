  "text": "Strong winds keeping many ferries tied up at ports\nStrong southerly winds disrupted ferry services across Greece on Thursday morning, forcing cancellations and leaving hundreds of passengers stranded at major ports.\nAccording to the Hellenic National Meteorological Service, winds in several sea areas reached 8 to 9 on the Beaufort scale. The Coast Guard said that from the port of Piraeus, only ferries bound for the Dodecanese islands were operating, while all other routes to island destinations were temporarily suspended. Services in the Saronic Gulf were halted until further notice.\nSimilar conditions were reported at the port of Rafina, where sailings to the Cyclades were canceled, and a sailing ban remained in effect at Lavrio.\nSeveral ferry crossings nationwide were also closed. Authorities urged travelers to contact local port offices and travel agencies before departure for updates on schedules.",
