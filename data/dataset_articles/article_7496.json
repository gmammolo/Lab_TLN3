  "text": "Medical emergency on Space Station, spacewalk postponed, Nasa monitoring situation\nAstronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman were set to conduct US spacewalk 94, lasting about 6.5 hours, starting around 8:00 a.m. EST.\nNasa has indefinitely postponed a planned spacewalk outside the International Space Station (ISS) scheduled for Thursday, January 8, 2026, due to a medical issue with an unidentified crew member that emerged on Wednesday afternoon.\nThe agency emphasised that the situation remains stable, prioritising crew safety above all mission activities, and will provide updates on the crew member's condition and a rescheduled spacewalk date soon.\nDue to medical privacy protocols, Nasa refrained from disclosing further details about the astronaut or the nature of the concern.\nPlanned Spacewalk Objectives\nAstronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman were set to conduct US spacewalk 94, lasting about 6.5 hours, starting around 8:00 a.m. EST.\nTheir primary tasks included preparing the ISS's 2A power channel for installing the final pair of roll-out solar arrays (iROSAs), which would boost power for the station's operations and eventual safe deorbit in roughly five years.\nThey also planned to swab five sites near the Quest airlock for microbial detection to study potential contamination risks in space.\nBroader Mission Implications\nThis delay affects the first of two spacewalks in January, with US spacewalk 95 targeted for January 15 involving camera replacement, navigational aid installation, and fluid system redundancies. Nasa took ISS live feeds offline shortly before the announcement, signaling caution.\nIn a late update, the agency revealed it is evaluating options, including an early end to the SpaceX Crew-11 mission, as crews train extensively for such contingencies.\n\"As an update to our earlier communication regarding a medical situation aboard the International Space Station, the matter involved a single crew member who is stable. Safely conducting our missions is our highest priority, and we are actively evaluating all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew-11’s mission. These are the situations Nasa and our partners train for and prepare to execute safely. We will provide further updates within the next 24 hours,\" Nasa updated.\nMedical issues in space, though rare, highlight microgravity challenges like fluid shifts or clots, as seen in past undisclosed cases.\nWith upcoming departures of SpaceX CRS-33 Dragon on January 21 and Japan's HTV-X on January 28, timelines for maintenance grow tighter. Nasa assures the public that monitoring continues, underscoring the robustness of onboard medical capabilities.",
