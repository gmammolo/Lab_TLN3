  "text": "A 25-year-old delivery partner working for quick-commerce platform Zepto was killed in a road accident in Hyderabad late on Monday night, reigniting concerns over the safety risks faced by gig workers amid ultra-fast delivery pressures.\nThe incident, which was also captured in a CCTV footage, took place near Mehdipatnam when the delivery executive, identified as K Abhishek, lost control of his two-wheeler while heading towards Tolichowki to deliver an order. A private travel bus following closely behind ran over him, killing him on the spot, a report by NDTV reported.\nAbhishek, a native of Shaikpet and a final-year BBA student, had taken up delivery work to support his family. Police said preliminary findings suggest he was rushing to complete the delivery when his bike skidded on the busy stretch.\n“We have registered a case and are investigating the circumstances of the accident. Initial inputs indicate the victim was in a hurry to complete the order,” a police official told NDTV, adding that gig workers should prioritise safety and wear helmets at all times.\n“Deadly” 10-minute delivery\nThe Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (TGPWU) strongly condemned the incident, calling it a direct fallout of what it described as “unrealistic and deadly” 10-minute delivery models adopted by quick-commerce platforms.\n“Ten-minute food and grocery deliveries always start on time. Rs 100-crore speed projects always start on time. But when a worker crashes on the road, insurance and compensation never start on time,” Shaik Salauddin, founder-president of TGPWU, as per report by NDTV. “Boardroom promises are not the ground reality. Workers are human beings, not algorithms.”\nThe union has demanded immediate intervention by the Telangana labour and employment minister, including an ex-gratia compensation of Rs 5 lakh for Abhishek’s family, coverage under the Workmen’s Compensation Act for gig workers, and the scrapping of delivery targets that encourage risky driving in heavy traffic.\nAbhishek’s body was handed over to his family after a post-mortem at Osmania General Hospital. Police said the investigation is ongoing to determine the exact sequence of events leading to the fatal skid.",
