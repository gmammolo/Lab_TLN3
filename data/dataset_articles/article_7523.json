  "text": "Warning after reports of children on frozen lakes\nPeople who play on frozen ice \"risk their lives\", Surrey Fire and Rescue Service has warned after it became aware of \"children and young people playing on frozen lakes and rivers\".\nThere have been cold conditions across the county this week, with flurries of snow reported in Reigate, Fetcham, Bagshot and Horley as temperatures fell below zero.\nStation commander and operational flood lead Lee Murray told BBC Radio Surrey ice was \"unpredictable this time of year, and dangerous\", adding that falling through could be fatal.\nMurray warned that, alongside the thickness of the ice not being clear, people also didn't know the depths of water underneath.\n\"If you've got undercurrents it can reduce the thickness of the ice,\" he said.\nHe urged people never to attempt to rescue someone on the ice, making clear that this put \"additional lives at risk\".\nWhile rescues are best left to the professionals, Murray said there was a \"complexity\" to such operations carried out by specific teams.\n\"They have to wear specific winter and water PPE...it's an arduous task,\" he said.\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, on X.
