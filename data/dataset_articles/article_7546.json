  "text": "Dozens of passengers were left scared and stranded after the tires of a LATAM Airlines flight blew out upon landing at a Georgia airport, according to authorities and reports.\nThe Boeing 767 had just arrived at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport from Lima, Peru, on Tuesday night when all of its rear landing tires suddenly blew out, according to Fox 5 Atlanta.\nThe Boeing 767 had just arrived at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport from Lima, Peru, on Tuesday night when its tires suddenly blew out. The plane landed safely and managed to come to a full stop, but the incident prompted a massive emergency response and delays on the tarmac, CBS Atlanta reported.\nThe Atlanta Fire Rescue Department confirmed to the outlet that its crews responded to the runway for “flat tires on an aircraft.”\nFootage captured passengers exiting the plane directly onto the runway as workers inspected and stabilized the damaged landing gear, according to the local station.\nOne passenger described to 11Alive that upon landing, bathroom doors and panels broke inside the plane, and some insulation fell from the ceiling.\nOne passenger recalled being stuck inside the aircraft for hours after the Boeing 767 touched down. X/daeboganmusic Passengers were still stuck on the plane until 9:40 p.m., roughly two hours after the aircraft touched down, she recalled.\nAfter finally getting off the plane, she also noticed that the blown tires appeared to be halfway melted.\nLATAM Airlines and the FAA did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.\nAirport operations were able to continue with minimal disruption, and no injuries were reported amid the chaos, according to CBS.\nThe FAA will investigate the tire failure, according to reports.",
