  "text": "Council urged to take action at accident hotspot\nResidents \"desperately need temporary traffic lights\" at a new junction in Surrey where there have been a number of crashes, the area's MP has said.\nThe new junction between Meath Green Lane, Webber Street, and Hoadley Road in Horley opened in May 2025.\nDorking and Horley MP Chris Coghlan says his office soon starting receiving reports of crashes, telling Surrey County Council (SCC) in December that it had been the site of \"at least seven serious road traffic incidents\".\nAcknowledging the issues, SCC says temporary signage will \"be in place imminently\".\n'Shocking'\nSophie Dupres, who collided with another vehicle when driving towards Reigate in September. said: \"I don't believe she knew that there was a junction, or could see the junction, because we just collided.\n\"Before I knew it, airbags were in my face, and I had been moved across the road.\"\nDupres described the road as a \"speed trap\".\n\"People speed down that road all the time. I know I'm not the only person who has suffered an accident,\" she says.\nThe incident has changed Dupres's driving habits.\n\"I don't like driving down there at all now, I'm very, very scared on the roads in general,\" she said.\nCoghlan says SCC has \"made a few changes but it's only recently that they've agreed to put in another give way sign\".\n\"It's shocking the council allowed this junction to open without suitable safety measures,\" he added.\nResponding to Coghlan's December letter, Matt Furniss, cabinet member for highways, transport and economic growth said SCC visited the site on the week before Christmas to \"identify any temporary measure\" which could \"make the junction more conspicuous to drivers\".\nThe suggestion was that a further temporary give way sign mounted just ahead of the central island on both the Webber Street and Hoadley Road approach would improve matters.\nA spokesperson for SCC said: \"The required signs are not in place but we are urging the [Development] Consortium to resolve this and will continue to do so.\n\"The Consortium have advised us that they will be in place imminently.\"\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, on X.
