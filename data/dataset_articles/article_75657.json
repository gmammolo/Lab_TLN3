  "text": "When they work correctly, the idea of self-driving cars is a fantastic one. When they don’t, it can be a scary mess. In Scottsdale, Arizona, a man almost missed his flight because of the Waymo taxi he was riding in. It seems that Mike Johns was trapped in the car as the self-driving taxi kept driving around a parking lot in circles. Johns was trying to get back home to Los Angeles when he found himself riding around getting dizzy like he was in a teacup at Disney, while at the same time having a maddening interaction with a Waymo customer service rep. Finally, Johns was able to get out of the car and catch a flight back home.\nSource: CBS News",
