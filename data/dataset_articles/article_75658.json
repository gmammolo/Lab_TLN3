  "text": "Districts responding following PowerSchool software cyberattack\nSPRINGFIELD, MA (WGGB/WSHM) - A well-known platform for school districts across the country, used to keep track of student records and communication with families, was hit by a cyberattack. Now, we know at least one district in western Massachusetts has been impacted.\nSpringfield Public Schools has confirmed they are among the school districts domestically and internationally that have been affected by this cyberattack.\nAs we have been covering since Wednesday night, PowerSchool announced Wednesday the recent cybersecurity incident had involved unauthorized access to information related to teachers and students. In fact, some of the exposed information include names and addresses.\nHowever, there are alarm bells being rung as some districts across the country may have included some Social Security numbers, as well as medical information.\nLocal school districts are warning parents about the breach, including Agawam and Westfield. On Thursday. Springfield Public Schools sent a robocall out to parents to make them aware of what happened. They also put out an update alert on their website that read, in part: “PowerSchool has reported to us that the issue has been contained and that they do not expect the data involved to be shared or made public. Springfield Public Schools takes the privacy and security of our staff and students very seriously. The district continues to investigate and closely monitor this situation. Updates will be provided as new information becomes available.”\nSpringfield Public Schools spokesperson Azell Cavaan said, while certain data may have been seen, Social Security numbers were not shared and that PowerSchool assured the district that the breached information did not go anywhere. She, however, did call the situation worrying. “We know that other districts in western Mass. and across the country and even in Canada were impacted by this. It’s concerning because you never want your information shared. It’s private information. It is an indication of the times that we live in,” she explained.\nWestern Mass News also spoke with one mother, Mari Sanabria, who was getting ready to pick up her son Thursday from Boland Elementary School.\nShe said she was scared when she heard the district’s robocall, and according to her, she is not the only parent who is worried.\n“I actually went on Facebook, and there were some groups that we pretty much went over how this is happening to our kids. It’s not fun as parents. We shouldn’t have to be dealing with things like that when their kids are in school,” Sanabria emphasized.\nSanabria also told us she thinks there should be more cybersecurity training and even re-training for the workers at PowerSchool.\nIn the meantime, the company has given all customers the green light to continue using the system.\nCopyright 2025.
