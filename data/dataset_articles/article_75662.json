  "text": "Samsung has already revealed the date for the next Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event 2025 . It is going to happen on January 22nd, 2025, both in India and globally. The Galaxy S25 series will be launched during the event along with other gadgets. And now, from the S25 series, the Galaxy S25 Slim has been spotted on the Geekbench database with the model number “SM-S937U”. Though the Geekbench database doesn’t specify this is the Galaxy S25 Slim and that it’s a US variant.\nHowever, tipster Jukanlosreve on X confirms that this is the US variant of the Galaxy S25 Slim. While earlier rumors suggested that some regions may get the Exynos 2500 SOC, this was later refuted as false information.\nAccording to the Geekbench database, it has managed to get a single-core score of 3005 and a multicore score of 6945. Although its single-core score is higher, its multicore score is closer to what we have seen in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SOC.\nThe CPU has two clusters, with 6 cores running at 3.53 GHz and 2 cores running at 4.47 GHz. So it could handle day-to-day tasks easily, but it might miss out on the true performance of the Snapdragon 8 Elite SOC.\nThe prototype that ran on the database reveals Android 15 ( Likely OneUI 7.0 ) out of the box and 10.86GB RAM, which will be marketed as 12GB RAM. Earlier, it was tipped that the entire Galaxy S25 Series line will start with 12GB RAM, and it looks like this is becoming a reality. Just to add, even the vanilla variant’s prototype which ran on Geekbench had a multicore score higher than 9000.\nSome rumors hint that the Slim variant may launch alongside the Galaxy S25 Series, while some say it may not.",
