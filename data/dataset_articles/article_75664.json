  "text": "2 hours ago\nNest thermostat at 2nd home worked perfectly through the app for the last 3 years. After Nest app update on 12/8/2024, the thermostat is showing offline in the app. We have called customer support twice. We have removed the thermostat from the app and re-added it twice. We have had the wifi company out twice to check the router and all equipment and it is all working fine. All other devices working fine. Ever since the update we can not control the thermostat through the app. Obviously this is related to the update. Someone please provide me with a solution..... we need to be able to control this thermostat that is hundreds of miles away from where we live! per Google, problems with connectivity have occurred after the update. When will the \"fix\" be applied so I can get this thermostat back online?\nan hour ago\nSame problem here. I don’t know if my thermostat works. In the app it shows offline but I’m hoping it will still work. Please inform?",
