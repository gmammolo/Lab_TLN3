  "text": "Key Points\n- New Year's Day brought hordes of people to La Jolla Shores tide pools.\n- King tides made the tide pools especially exposed, revealing marine life.\n- Many people were documented mishandling marine life, which is a crime.\nOn New Year’s Day, hordes of people flocked to La Jolla Shores in San Diego, CA to explore the tide pools, which were especially exposed thanks to a king tide event.\nHowever, instead of looking with their eyes, not their hands – as one might tell a child – many tide pool visitors were seen picking up wildlife, plucking starfish off the rocks, snatching live lobsters, stomping on sea anemones, and other marine life atrocities.\nAs imagined, many environmental advocates were furious from the scenes.\n“I saw people taking animals in marine protected areas, putting them in buckets,” Savannah Ekelem, a marine life enthusiast, told local news. “I saw them handling them inappropriately. All of the stampeding on the algae, the coral, the creatures themselves dwindling in numbers due to all of this…it will take time to regenerate.”\nBoat Surfs 12ft Wave at San Diego Mysto Spot (Video)\n“He barely got out of that.” Hurricane Narda nearly annihilates a boat of surfers during XL waves in San Diego.\nDashel Pierson\n0Elsewhere, on reddit, a thread showed the throngs of people rambling along the rocks, and stepping on marine life. The comment from the scene described:\n“Kids poking and grabbing at sea life. Star fish ripped off the rocks. Parents just standing around doing nothing or worse, stomping through the pools in their boots. The women next to use said she saw two kids pickup two small lobsters, bang them together and the throw them.”\nFollowing the incident, the backlash was so bad that the city of La Jolla felt it necessary to issue a statement, which laid out the following guidelines:\n– Do not touch or take animals or plants: Much of La Jolla is a state marine reserve, and there are law-protected spots throughout.\n– Watch your step: Shoes and footsteps can damage the animals and their habitats.\n– Respect and observe: These creatures hide in the tide pools for safety and the tide pools are in need of conservation.\nSome of the actions seen in the videos are, in fact, illegal. They can result in fines up to $5,000, and in some cases, jail time. No word yet if any penalties have been issued.\nSwimmers Slammed into Rocks by Large Surf in San Diego (Video)\nLifeguards make heroic rescue of two spearfishermen in La Jolla amidst 6-to-8ft surf – “He thinks he would have died if the lifeguards had not been there.”\nDashel Pierson\n0About the author\nDashel Pierson\nManaging Editor, SURFER",
