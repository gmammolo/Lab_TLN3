  "text": "IGM Biosciences ([IGMS](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/igms)) announced a strategic update to halt further development of imvotamab, an IgM-based CD20 X CD3 bispecific antibody T cell engager, and IGM-2644, an IgM-based CD38 X CD3 bispecific antibody T cell engager, for autoimmune diseases. “Interim data from the Phase 1b studies of imvotamab in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus show that the depth and consistency of B cell depletion is insufficient to meet our high bar for success. Due to these findings, we have decided to discontinue further development of imvotamab. I would like to thank the patients and investigators who have participated in the imvotamab clinical studies as well as our employees for their commitment to transforming the lives of patients living with autoimmune diseases. Concurrent with discontinuation of the imvotamab program, IGM-2644 is also being terminated due to strategic considerations,” said Mary Beth Harler, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of IGM Biosciences.\nStay Ahead of the Market:\n- Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with\n[Top Smart Score Stocks](https://www.tipranks.com/screener/top-smart-score-stocks) - Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using\n[Tipranks' Stock Screener](https://www.tipranks.com/screener/stocks)\nPublished first on [TheFly](https://thefly.com/) – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
