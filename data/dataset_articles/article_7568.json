According to police, Sumeet was driving the SUV. It was his birthday.\nSumeet and Nikhil were third-year BBA students at ICFAI Business School, while Surya Teja was in the second year. Rohit was a student of MGIT.\nThe vehicle rammed into the tree at high speed. Four occupants died on the spot, while the fifth sustained grievous injuries. The injured has been identified as Nakshatra, a third-year student of BBA at ICFAI Business School. The 20-year-old was admitted to a hospital, and her condition is stated to be critical.\nThe SUV was badly mangled in the collision. Police were trying to ascertain if the person at the wheel was drunk at the time of the accident.\nThe bodies were shifted to a government hospital at Chevella for post-mortem examination. Police registered a case and took up further investigation.\nHyderabad and its suburbs have seen similar accidents in the recent past when students out for a pleasure trip or birthday celebrations rammed their cars into other vehicles or roadside trees, or electrical poles.\nPolice in Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda commissionerates have been conducting an intensive drive to check drunk driving, especially during night hours.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",
