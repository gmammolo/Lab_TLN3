  "text": "By Hayden Thompson ,\n2 hours ago\nPENNSYLVANIA (WTAJ) — Pornography and AI-generated deepfakes led to charges against a Pennsylvania State Police corporal, Attorney General Michelle Henry announced Thursday.\nStephen Kamnik, 38, of Havertown, was charged after investigators seized his workstation computer that contained a hard drive full of thousands of pornographic files. Kamnik was noted to be stationed at Troop K in Schwenksville, Montgomery County.\nThe hard drive allegedly contained evidence that some of the media files were produced utilizing software to create “deepfakes,” which are artificial images or videos that are created using a person’s photo or video. These types of photos and videos are made with artificial intelligence to look real.\nKamnik is charged with a felony of unauthorized use of a computer and a misdemeanor of misapplication of entrusted property. The charges were filed through the Pennsylvania State Police. He was arraigned on the charges and was given a $1,000 unsecured bail.\nAccording to PSP, Kamnik has been a trooper since 2011. He is currently suspended without pay as the investigation is ongoing. The case will be prosecuted by Senior Deputy Attorney General James Price.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
