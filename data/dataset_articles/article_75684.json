  "text": "Australian Technical Forecast: AUD/USD Weekly Trade Levels\n- Aussie breaks 2022 trend support- threatens sixth weekly sell-off into yearly open\n[AUD/USD](/ie/forex-trading/aud-usd/)bears testing support for a fourth week, January opening-range intact ahead of NFP- Resistance 6335/62, 6466-6511 (key), ~6576- Support 6170-6200 (key), 6007/45, 5795\nThe Australian Dollar is threatening a sixth consecutive weekly decline with AUD/USD trading into key support into the start of the year. Battle lines drawn on the AUD/USD weekly technical chart ahead Non-Farm Payrolls.\nReview my latest[Weekly Strategy Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myHQTWMtLkY&t=1330s)for an in-depth breakdown of this Aussie setup and more.\n[Join live](https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/7158044326659673430)on Monday’s at 8:30am EST.\nAustralian Dollar Price Chart – AUD/USD Weekly\nChart Prepared by Michael Boutros, Sr. Technical Strategist; [AUD/USD on TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AUDUSD/?exchange=FOREXCOM)\nTechnical Outlook: In last month’s [Australian Dollar Technical Forecast](/ie/news-and-analysis/australian-dollar-technical-forecast-aud-usd-bears-go-for-the-break-12-13-2024/) we noted that AUD/USD was, “threatening a break of multi-year support, and the focus is on a pivot into the yearly lows. From a trading standpoint, rallies should be limited to 6433 IF price is heading lower on this stretch with a close below 6335 needed to fuel the next leg of the decline.”\nAussie broke lower the following week with AUD/USD plunging nearly 5.3% off the December high. Price has been testing a key support confluence for the past four-weeks at the 2022 low-week close (LWC) / swing low at 6170-6200. Note that the lower parallel of the September pitchfork (blue) converges on this range and further highlights the technical significance of this zone- threat remains for price inflection off this threshold in the weeks ahead.\nInitial weekly resistance is eyed at the 2023 LWC / April low at 6335/62 and is backed by 6466-6511- a region defined by the 38.2% retracement of the 2024 decline and the July close low. We will reserve this threshold as our bearish invalidation level with a breach / close above the median-line needed to suggest a more significant low is in place / larger reversal is underway towards the 200-day moving average (currently 6576) and the 61.8% retracement at 6648.\nA break / weekly close below this key pivot zone would threaten another bout of accelerated losses for Aussie with such a scenario exposing subsequent support objectives at the 2008 low / 78.6% retracement of the 2020 advance at 6007/45 and the 2020 low-day close (LDC) at 5795 (both levels of interest for possible downside exhaustion / price inflection IF reached).\nBottom line: AUD/USD has been testing downtrend support for the past four-weeks with the January opening-rang taking shape just above- looking for the breakout. From a trading standpoint, a good zone to reduce portions of short-exposure / lower protective stops- rallies should be limited to 6362 IF price is heading lower on this stretch with a close below 6170 needed to fuel the next major leg of the decline.\nKeep in mind we get the release of key U.S. jobs data tomorrow with the December Non-Farm Payroll report on tap. Stay nimble into the release and watch he weekly close here for guidance.
