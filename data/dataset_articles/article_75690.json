  "text": "Apparently, the mail and VPN provider Proton is currently experiencing problems. The login to the free mail service of the company, which is popular with security-conscious users, is failing and there are also problems with the VPN: the reports on error portals are piling up.\nAnzeige Anyone using Proton as groupware should find something else to do late Thursday afternoon. During a test at around 5:30 p.m., neither logging in to the mail service nor accessing a calendar worked. However, the online storage and password manager worked. Apparently not everywhere: as the provider's status page reveals, the disruption affects practically all services, but according to Proton, only some users.\nThe mail and groupware account at Proton currently greets those wishing to log in with an error message (Image: heise security / cku)\nThe reason for the disruption is also unclear, with Proton referring to \"temporary network problems\". They are working to resolve the problems as quickly as possible. Users will therefore have to be patient.\n( cku )\nDon't miss any news – follow us on Facebook , LinkedIn or Mastodon .\nThis article was originally published in German . It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",
