  "text": "NEW ALBANY, Ind. — Students and staff in New Albany Floyd County Schools may have had their data compromised on Thursday after one cloud based software vendor experienced a cybersecurity breech.\nIn an email sent to families, New Albany Floyd County School Corporation (NAFC) said student data software vendor, PowerSchool, has experienced a widespread cybersecurity data breach.\nPowerSchool is a cloud-based software company that provides student information systems for K-12 schools. PowerSchool serves thousands of school districts worldwide and many of these districts have also been impacted by the breech.\nPowerSchool notified NAFC that some student and employee data was involved in the breach. They NAFC is not the only district effected and the breech could not have been prevented locally.\n\"The security of our student and staff data is taken very seriously, and upon learning of the PowerSchool incident, NAFC immediately began an internal investigation to begin determining what data has been compromised,\" the school said in a statement.\nPowerSchool told the district they have taken action to \"ensure the unauthorized data was deleted by malicious actors without any further replication or dissemination.\"\nThe district says PowerSchool does not anticipate any student or staff data being shared or made public and are working with cybersecurity industry advisors and law enforcement to ensure data safety.\nNAFC says they will continue to work closely with PowerSchool to learn the full scope of the breach and will continue to communicate with families as they learn more.\nMake it easy to keep up-to-date with more stories like this.
