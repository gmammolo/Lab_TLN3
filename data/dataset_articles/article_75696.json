  "text": "The last year of Sony’s first-party releases on PC, like God of War Ragnarok and Until Dawn remake , have all attracted criticism for one reason: Mandatory PlayStation Network account linking. Given the fact that there are hundreds of countries where PSN isn’t even available, that’s obviously a big problem.\nUnsurprisingly, however, one of Sony’s next major PC releases will continue down that path. As confirmed on its official Steam page, The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC will require to link their PlayStation Network account. The game is, of course, a purely single-player experience (including the remaster’s roguelike mode No Return), but as with other Sony titles on PC of late, it will come with the PSN overlay and support for Trophies.\nThe Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is due out for PC on April 3 . Meanwhile, Season 2 of the HBO The Last of Us series is kicking off in the same month .",
