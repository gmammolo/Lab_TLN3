  "text": "By Alana Loftus ,\n1 hours ago Elon Musk has made a strange confession about his drinking habits on his social media platform, X.\nThe Space X CEO shared a photo of his nightstand, covered with cans of Diet Coke, which appears to be his kryptonite. The rare glimpse into the tech mogul’s personal space also includes a pair of black boots beside his bed and a pair of headphones on the nightstand. The 53-year-old added in a separate tweet, “Clearly, I need to switch to glass bottle DC.”\nIn the true nature of the internet, people instantly began trolling Musk and his weakness for the soda, which is commonly known to contain a harmful, artificial sweetener called Aspertame. Per the official definition on google, long term consumption of Aspartame can lead to major health concerns.\nMichelle Obama's excuse for skipping Jimmy Carter's funeral revealed Brutal moment Bill Clinton and Hillary pointedly snub Trump and Melania at Jimmy Carter's funeral Aspartame consumption may impact on metabolism and has possible links to stroke and dementia. It was also deemed ‘possibly carcinogenic to humans’ by the World Health Organization. User @jonny33baseball joked, “I’m no expert but maybe you’d listen to @grok. Drinking that much aspartame is going to get you to the opposite of space. Have you tried squeezing lemons in water?”\n@maya_chiy took a more serious approach, writing: “RFK needs to help you work on your food and drink choices. You are too important to the world to drink that poison. Besides, you are helping big food hurt people by supporting their awful products. People admire you and will copy you.”\nMusk's behavior on social media has been characteristically bizarre lately. Yesterday, he called out Anna Wintour, the Editor-in-Chief of Vogue, for not putting \"Melania Trump on the cover.\" He noted that Wintour put Jill Biden on the cover of Vogue.\nFor the latest local news and features on Irish America, visit our homepage here .\n16",
