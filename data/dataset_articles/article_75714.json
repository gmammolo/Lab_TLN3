  "text": "Sunday\nI purchased a new Nest Hub and I am finding it impossible to connect to my Google Nest Pro WiFi network. I first repeatedly got an error message indicating “failure to connect”. I then moved the hub closer to the primary web point, when I plugged the unit in, it updated the software twice and then indicated that I needed to “Link account” in Google Home. When I open Google Home, my account appears to be linked, but the error message will not go away and I still can’t connect it to my WiFi network, which by the way is Google Nest Pro. This is a very frustrating experience and I am on the verge of returning the product to the store. Any suggestions would be helpful.\n2 hours ago\nHi Bobbrown,\nThank you for your response. I'm sorry to hear that you're unable to set up your Nest Hub for the error message “failure to connect”. I'm happy to help you!\nAt the moment, i need to ask a few questions to give the correct troubleshooting below:\nkeep me posted.\nBest regards,\nRusell.\n2 hours ago\nHello Russell:\nThank you for your response. There are no other Google Nest displays in my home, and this is a house (not a business, school or a shared apartment network). I am able to find my network (which is a Google Nest Pro Web wifi network). I have followed all of the suggestions mentioned on this forum, with no success. When I have attempted to connect, I have placed the device on my office desk, near the primary Google Nest Pro Web node and away from TVs and audio speakers.\nIf you need any additional information or have other suggestions, please let me know.\nBob\na minute ago\nThis afternoon, I noticed that the Google Home app needed to be updated on my iPhone. So I completed the update and attempted to connect the Nest Hub again:\nThis all very frustrating and I have no clue as to what is going or why.",
