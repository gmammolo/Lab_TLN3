  "text": "Saturday\nMost buttons don't work except for the voice assistant button and power button. I know for sure the physical buttons aren't broken since when resetting the remote I had to hold the home button and I could reset, I also had to enter pairing mode and it did enter thar. However it was having a hard time connecting. When connected it said there were updates but when trying to run the updates it said something went wrong and suddenly it said the remote was up to date. This feels like a software. How do I fix this? I don't want to have to completely reset my chromecast\nI also wanna go on a rant about this whole support process and how horrible it is:\n- I tried the option where google support should call me, then it said I should try again in support hours, whilst I didn't see support hours mentioned anywhere, I only saw when I scrolled back to the top of the page hidden behind an otherwise useless button, having it behind a button doesn't add anything except frustration and confusion. Also if it would've been outside service hours don't give me the option because it literally wasted my time since I also had to give information and give a short summary which was useless since it said its outside of service hours\n- Thenn I tried the \"Send a message\" button, which literary gave me a 404\nThese issues shouldnt be happening in a multi billion dollar company. The support website feels like it's made by some cheap outsourced developers that still have the book \"Programming for dummies\" next to them. And the support isn't the only thing that feels unpolished and bad, it's literally in every product. Every Google product feels unpolished and not 100% thought through\n/Rant\nTuesday\nHello Tiezzymeister,\nThank you for taking an interest in our community.
