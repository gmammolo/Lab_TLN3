  "text": "Sunday\nI got the \"You need a free Nest Power Connector\" message when I'm trying to install 3rd gen thermostat. I would like to how to get a free nest power connector. Thanks.\n34m ago\nHi SamX928,\nThank you for sharing your concerns with me. I understand that you're interested in redeeming the Nest Power Connector promotion. I'd be happy to help you understand how to acquire it.\nTo get this device, follow these steps:\nDuring the compatibility or power check, the app will determine if you need a Nest Power Connector.\nThe Google Home app will provide a link to the Google Store, allowing you to order it.\nThis link will direct you to the Google Store, automatically adding the product to your cart and applying the necessary coupon code.\nNote: If the promotional link for the Nest Power Connector is no longer appearing, you can try performing a factory reset and reinstalling the unit. This may help the link to reappear; this is an article for your reference: Restart or reset a Nest thermostat.\nLet me know if these suggestions were helpful.\nRegards,\nDaniel",
