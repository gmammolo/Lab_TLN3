  "text": "Sunday\nHi,\nI cannot get internet connection on devices which I have used the pause function on the Google home app.\nI have unpaused all the devices and those devices which were paused are not connecting to the internet.\nMultiple devices including Windows PC, Android phones are not working.\n39m ago\nHi Shane-F,\nThanks for the update. I'm sorry to hear about the situation that you are experiencing with the internet connection on devices on which I have used the pause function. I understand how frustrating it can be when things don't work as expected. But don't worry; help is here. In this case, I recommend that you try some steps for the app:\nReconnect Paused Devices:\n2. Restart Network Equipment:\n3. Verify Network Settings:\n4. App Troubleshooting:\nBest regards,\nJenny",
