  "text": "Using Microsoft Chatbot to Generate Microsoft FUD Against SSH/OpenSSH\nIt's from the\n \"prime suspect\" of the Day:\nAnd of course gptzero.me deems this to be LLM slop, not a real article!\nChatbots controlled by Microsoft and\ncurated by wage slaves in Kenya have become weapon against \"Linux\" because some unprincipled fools and liars misuse chatbots to craft fake articles (easier than done manually). Now they do the same to SSH/OpenSSH, which competes against proprietary bloatware of Microsoft and its partners. We've seen and rebutted such nonsense before, even as recently as 3 weeks ago.\nWe need to call out the people who spew out Microsoft propaganda (often generated by Microsoft entities) into the Web. Later on the scrapers will pick up those lies, reinforcing their own biases, which were tweaked by Microsoft staff.\n[█](#top)",
