  "text": "3 weeks ago\nWe’ve got a LPG radiator heating system which has been great for the last year. In the last couple of weeks it has started preheating way too early. We work so schedule is for heat (with max duration set to 1 hour) in the morning, eco during the day then heat for when we get home from work. As an example, yesterday the Nest turned the heating on at 3.15 to raise the house temperature by 1 degree by 5pm. As a consequence it had reached temperature nearly an hour too early. Any ideas anyone please? True radiant is on and limited to 1 hour for morning; system definitely has the correct heating set up applied.\n2 weeks ago\nHi Fieldfare,\nThanks for reaching out to the community.

I appreciate you taking the time to respond to my questions. I see that you have a Nest Learning Thermostat 4th gen to control the boiler, but it has started coming on at 1530 in order to lift the temperature by 2 degrees by 1730 irrespective of the outside temperature.\nCan you please send me a picture of the current wiring on the Nest Learning thermostat to see if there are discrepancies?\nAny additional details you can provide will be helpful.\nRegards,\nGabriela\nTuesday\nThank you for your reply. How do I insert a photo via this messaging please?\nTuesday\nHi Fieldfare,\nThank you for your response.

I understand that you have a Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd gen rather than a Nest Learning Thermostat 4th gen. I'm happy to continue assisting you right now.\nThe process is almost the same for your Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd gen but with the Nest app. I recommend checking the Nest app thermostat settings below:\nLet me know how it goes.\nRegards,\nGabriela",
