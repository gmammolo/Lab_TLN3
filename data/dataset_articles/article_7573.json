  "text": "A tense incident unfolded Wednesday afternoon at a shopping mall in Beit Shemesh, when a three-year-old girl’s leg became trapped in an escalator at the Kenyon Hashedra.\nEmergency crews from the Beit Shemesh fire and rescue station were dispatched after reports that the child’s leg had been caught in the escalator’s mechanical system. Firefighters worked carefully using specialized tools, carrying out a delicate and complex rescue operation.\nWithin a short time, the teams succeeded in freeing the child safely. Medical personnel examined her at the scene, and authorities confirmed that she was not in any danger.\nFire and rescue officials noted that this was the second such incident at the same mall and on the same escalator within the past month. In light of the recurring accidents, they again emphasized safety guidelines, urging parents not to allow children to use escalators without close adult supervision.\n{Matzav.com}",
