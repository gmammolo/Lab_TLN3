  "text": "See full bio Obaid Ur Rehman At Tech4Gamers, I mainly cover new gaming news, leaks, and rumours. Aside from that, I love to write features about my favourite games while inserting my opinion about their different aspects.\nSee full bio Story Highlight Assassin’s Creed Shadows was delayed last year as it wasn’t in a condition to be released. The gaming giant has spent a lot of additional resources on it and made massive improvements. However, despite such improvements it is delaying the game once again as AC Shadows’ new release date is March 20. Assassin’s Creed Shadows was delayed following the poor sales of Star Wars Outlaws . Due to the poor sales of one of its major games, the company’s value went downhill and is still trying to recover.\nSo, the gaming giant couldn’t have endured another failure last year, which is exactly why it delayed the Assassin’s Creed title. The game was supposed to be released on 14 February 2025 after the delay, but now Ubisoft has delayed it again , and it will be launching on 20th March.\nWhy it matters: Ubisoft’s current condition isn’t good, as reports highlight that it could go bankrupt in 2025 . However, a successful AC Shadows launch could change the trajectory the company is heading to.\nUbisoft Reveals That AC Shadows Has Been Delayed Once Again For Further Improvements | Source: Twitter Just recently, the game’s official Twitter account has revealed that the next mainline title in the franchise, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is being delayed yet again. The developers are taking over a month to make even more tweaks so the fandom has the best experience.\nWe believe a few additional weeks are needed to implement feedback and ensure an even more ambitious and engaging day-one experience.\n-Ubisoft\nThe gaming giant has provided a strategic update revealing that it is focusing on gameplay quality and providing engaging day-1 gameplay experiences to the fandom. To make that happen, delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows one more time was kind of necessary as now, the developers will implement the player feedback gathered over the past 3 months.\nJust recently, Ubisoft also revealed a lot more information about the enhanced pakour system along with footage. The improvements were actually notable as Ubisoft is now taking the game seriously, given the company’s condition is pretty serious .\nFans who have been looking forward to the title will have to wait a little longer now, but it will be worth it, as playing a game in its best condition is way better.\nWhat do you think about Assassin’s Creed Shadows being delayed yet again? Do you think it is putting everything on the upcoming AC title? Share your thoughts with us in the comment section below or join the official Tech4Gamers forums for discussion.",
