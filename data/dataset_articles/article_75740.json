  "text": "shut down the developer behind a viral devicethat could respond to ChatGPT queries to aim and fire an automated rifle. Futurism reports: The contraption, as seen in\na videothat's been making its rounds on social media, sparked a frenzied debate over our undying attempts to turn dystopian tech yanked straight out of the \"Terminator\" franchise into a reality. STS 3D's invention also apparently caught the attention of OpenAI, who says it swiftly shut him down for violating its policies. When Futurism reached out to the company, a spokesperson said that \"we proactively identified this violation of our policies and notified the developer to cease this activity ahead of receiving your inquiry.\"\nSTS 3D-- who didn't respond to our request for comment -- used OpenAI's Realtime API to give his weapon a cheery voice and a way to decipher his commands. \"ChatGPT, we're under attack from the front left and front right,\" he told the system in the video. \"Respond accordingly.\" Without skipping a beat, the rifle jumped into action, shooting what appeared to be blanks while aiming at the nearby walls.",
