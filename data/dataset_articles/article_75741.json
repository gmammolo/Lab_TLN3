  "text": "Los Angeles Fire Threatens Mt. Wilson Communication Transmitters\nElon Musk already promised free Starlink terminals.\nThe Eaton fire in Los Angeles has reached Mt. Wilson, which houses communication and broadcast transmitters.\nPolice and firefighters rely on those towers to communicate with each other. The destruction would also affect truck drivers using radios.\nThe majority of LA’s broadcast stations have antennas on Mt. Wilson. From Variety:\nAccording to KCBS/KCAL news, hand crews have arrived at Mt. Wilson to fight the blaze.\nMost of Los Angeles’ TV stations broadcast from Mt. Wilson, including KCBS (CBS 2), KNBC (NBC 4), KTLA (Channel 5), KABC (ABC 7), KCAL (Channel 9), KTTV (Fox 11), KCOP (Channel 13), KCET (PBS SoCal 2 Channel 28), KOCE (PBS SoCal 1 Channel 50) and KMEX (Univision 34). FM stations broadcasting from there include KPCC-FM 89.3, KPFK-FM 90.7, KUSC-FM 91.5, KRRL-FM 92.3, KCBS-FM 93.1, KLLI-FM 93.9, KTWV 94.7, KLOS-FM 95.5, KNX-FM 97.1, KKLA-FM 99.5, KKLQ-FM 100.3, KRTH-FM 101.1, KSCA-FM 101.9, KIIS-FM 102.7, KOST-FM 103.5, KBIG-FM 104.3, KKGO-FM 105.1, KPWR-FM 105.9 and KLVE-FM 107.5.\n🚨\n[#BREAKING]: CRITICAL communication infrastructure is on the verge of being incinerated by the Eaton Fire in Los AngelesMost LA TV and radio stations have their antennas atop Mt. Wilson, including NBC, ABC, CBS, etc.\nToday’s Starlink deliveries are now vital, as emergency…\n[pic.twitter.com/YkIb4WZ0kC]— Nick Sortor (@nicksortor)\n[January 9, 2025]\nBREAKING 🚨: Local News KTLA5 shows webcam viewing of Mt. Wilson catching fire.\nReporters say this WILL be CATASTROPHIC as this location has towers and satellites that Firefighters and Police are using now for communications. This will impact radio stations and TV NEWS!\n[pic.twitter.com/g4CiDrt6ou]— Anthony (@AnthonyCabassa_)\n[January 9, 2025]\nThe Famous Mt. Wilson Observatory staff announced the majority evacuated from the building, leaving behind a few to keep watch.\nThe Observatory has no power, limiting communication.\nElon Musk already promised Starlink terminals to the affected areas.\nIt seems TV stations have already used Starlink because cell towers aren’t working.\nSpaceX will provide free Starlink terminals to affected areas in LA tomorrow morning\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)\n[January 9, 2025]\nDONATE\nDonations tax deductible\nto the full extent allowed by law.",
