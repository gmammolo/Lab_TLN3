  "text": "Live Fast-moving brushfire erupts as powerful blazes still burn in LA World News Student allegedly creates deepfake porn of female students using AI By News.com.au Published Jan. 9, 2025, 6:12 p.m. ET A student who allegedly made deepfake pornography of other female students at a school in Sydney, Australia is set to face disciplinary action over the “abhorrent” incident.\nThe senior in high school, who cannot be named, allegedly used images from social media along with artificial intelligence to create pornographic photos of female students.\nA deepfake is digitally created or generated content that can portray someone doing something that never happened.\n4 The high school student allegedly used images from social media, along with AT to create the photos. AFP via Getty Images The student also reportedly made fake social media profiles, according to The Daily Telegraph.\nParents and students were notified of the incident in an email from New South Wales’ Department of Education.\n“The school has been made aware that a 12th grade male student has allegedly used artificial intelligence to create a profile that resembles your daughters and others,” the email read.\n“Unfortunately, innocent photos from social media and school events have been used.\n4 The student also reportedly made fake social media profiles. EduLife Photos – stock.adobe.com “We want to emphasize that your daughters have done nothing wrong, there are no inappropriate real photos of them being used.\n“I am sorry this has occurred.”\nA NSW Department of Education spokesman said the department was working closely with police, who had launched an investigation into the incident.\n“We do not tolerate such behavior and will take the appropriate action,” the spokesman said.\n“Our highest priority is to ensure our students feel safe and any decision about this student’s future involvement in the school will be based on that.\n“We are helping affected students with appropriate wellbeing support and will do so as long as required.”\nA NSW Police spokeswoman confirmed an investigation was launched on Jan. 6 following reports “inappropriate images were being produced and distributed online”.\n4 A NSW Police spokeswoman confirmed an investigation was launched on Jan. 6. Debalina – stock.adobe.com “NSW Police are working with the eSafety Commissioner and the Department of Education. The investigation is ongoing,” the spokeswoman said.\nNSW Minister for Education Prue Car said the incident was “abhorrent” and would not be tolerated while speaking at a press conference on Thursday morning.\n“There will be disciplinary action for the student,” Car said.\nShe thanked the deputy principal and the leadership at the school for their quick action and said the top priority was to ensure all students affected would be OK to return to school in the coming weeks.\n“Especially given the concerns that you would have if any of your children were facing this, but these students are in the senior secondary levels of their education, and this is an abhorrent turn of events, and there will be serious disciplinary action,” Car said.\nNSW Premier Chris Minns echoed Car’s thoughts.\n“This is illegal behavior, and I’m not going to speak about the specific case, because obviously that is before the police, and therefore it’s taken very seriously both by police and by the Department of Education, no matter where it happens,” Minns said.\nIt follows a similar incident at a school in Victoria’s northwest in June last year when a student allegedly created graphic nude images of about 50 girls from the school.\nA Victoria Police spokeswoman said a 17-year-old boy was issued a caution in relation to allegedly circulating explicit images online.\n4 Minns said that the investigation will be taken seriously by the police and the Department of Education. Zuffa LLC “After extensive investigations, police consider the matter closed,” the spokeswoman said.\n“If new information comes to light, police will investigate further.”\neSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said deepfakes could be “devastating to the person whose image is taken and altered without their knowledge or consent”.\n“Image-based abuse, including the production of deepfake images and videos, is a persistent online harm which also represents one of the most egregious invasions of privacy,” Inman said.\nShe said the eSafety Commission could “provide real help” to Australians who fall victim to image-based abuse and urged anyone concerned about the non-consensual sharing of intimate images to come forward.\nThe Senate passed a bill in August last year to tackle the rise in the creation and distribution of non-consensual deepfake pornography.\nFiled under artificial intelligence australia child pornography deepfakes porn 1/9/25 Read Next Making art and fun from the ice, snow and freezing cold in...
