The AG's Office states they investigated the app and found videos with drugs, nudity, alcohol, and profanity, were accessible to minors. Texas - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a second lawsuit against TikTok, accusing the social media giant of misleading parents and exposing minors to inappropriate and explicit content.\nThe lawsuit alleges that TikTok falsely marketed its platform as safe for children while concealing the true extent of explicit material accessible to young users.\nSUGGESTED: Texas sues TikTok over claims app illegally shares minor&apos;s data\nAccording to the lawsuit, TikTok lied about its content safety standards in an effort to maintain its current age rating on major app stores. The platform is accused of downplaying the presence of graphic videos featuring drugs, nudity, alcohol, and profanity, labeling such content as \"infrequent\" and \"mild.\"\nHowever, the AG&apos;s Office said an investigation conducted by them reportedly found an \"endless stream\" of such material accessible to minors.\n\"TikTok actively worked to deceive parents and lure children onto their app despite the presence of an overwhelming amount of profane and illicit material,\" said Paxton in a statement. \"Companies may not jeopardize the health and wellbeing of Texas children by blatantly lying about the products they provide.\"\nGet news, weather and so much more on the new FOX LOCAL app\nThis is not the first time Paxton has targeted TikTok over alleged risks to minors. The Attorney General previously sued the platform for violating the Securing Children Online Through Parental Empowerment (\"SCOPE\") Act, which aims to enhance online safety and privacy protections for Texas children.\nThe Source: The information in the article came from the press release issued by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's Office.\nTikTok Texas Latest News\nHouston Livestock Show and Rodeo releases 2025 entertainment lineup",
