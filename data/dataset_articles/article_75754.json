  "text": "In the wake of Meta’s decision to overhaul its content moderation policies, Google searches for how to delete accounts on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads have skyrocketed across the United States, TechCrunch is reporting.\nThis surge in user interest follows CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement that the company will discontinue its third-party fact-checking system and relax previous restrictions on political content in user feeds.\nData from Google Trends shows a dramatic spike in searches such as “how to permanently delete Facebook,” which has reached a maximum interest score of 100—the highest rating Google assigns to query popularity. Other related terms like “how to delete Instagram account without logging in,” “Facebook alternatives,” and “how to quit Facebook” have seen popularity surge by over 5,000%.\nThis wave of search activity highlights growing dissatisfaction among users concerned about the implications of Meta’s loosened content policies, including the spread of misinformation, hate speech, and violent rhetoric on its platforms.\nMeta had previously implemented tighter content moderation and fact-checking policies to combat harmful content. These measures followed a series of scandals, such as the role Facebook played in enabling coordinated calls for violence during the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.\nFurther criticism stems from Meta’s role in the 2017 Rohingya crisis in Myanmar, where the platform was used to incite violence and genocide. These incidents highlighted the real-world dangers posed by unregulated online spaces, pressuring Meta to prioritize user safety.\nNow, however, Meta plans to replace third-party fact-checkers with a “community notes” system, akin to one implemented by Elon Musk’s X. This change aims to rely on user feedback to provide context for posts rather than expert-reviewed content oversight.",
