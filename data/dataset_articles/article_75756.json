  "text": "Summary\n- Pokemon GO will soon be unplayable on some older mobile devices following a pair of updates that will end support for 32-bit Android devices.\n- Players using affected devices are advised to save login info and upgrade phones to continue playing after the updates drop in March and June 2025.\n- Despite the inconvenience, the coming year holds promise for the Pokemon franchise with planned and rumored game releases for 2025.\nPokemon GO is soon to become unplayable on a number of different mobile devices, with some phones set to lose access to the game as early as March 2025. While these phones are older models, as the change will only affect 32-bit Android devices, [Pokemon GO](https://gamerant.com/db/video-game/pokemon-go/) fans who haven't upgraded their phones for a long time may need to consider a trade-in if they want to keep playing.\nAn [augmented reality walking game](https://gamerant.com/best-ar-augmented-reality-walking-games/) that has players wandering about the real world in search of new Pokemon to catch and battle, Pokemon GO is coming up on its ninth anniversary this summer, having launched in July 2016. While past reports show the game hitting peak player activity of around 232 million active players in its debut year, it's still quite popular, with an [ActivePlayer report](https://activeplayer.io/pokemon-go/) for December 2024 showing more than 110 million players in the prior 30-day period.\n[Related\n](/pokemon-go-black-and-white-kyurem-release-date/)\n[\nPokemon GO Announces Two Legendary Debuts for the Tour: Unova Event\n](/pokemon-go-black-and-white-kyurem-release-date/)\nNiantic reveals two highly anticipated legendaries that will be released in Pokemon GO as part of the GO Tour: Unova event with an interesting twist.\nBut some of those players will be cut off over the next few months, as Niantic works to make the game run more smoothly on more current devices, necessitating the end of service for 32-bit Androids. The [official Pokemon GO website](https://pokemongolive.com/post/32-bit-android-discontinued-support-2025) announced on January 9 that several older phone models will not be supported by the game following a pair of updates set to launch in March and June 2025. The first update will affect some Android devices that downloaded the game from the Samsung Galaxy store, while the second round will specifically affect 32-bit Android devices that acquired [Pokemon GO through Google Play](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-go-all-google-play-partner-research-tasks-rewards/). The game's development team has provided a non-comprehensive list of phones that will not be able to play Pokemon GO after these updates go live, but the message to fans makes note that 64-bit Android devices and all iPhones should still be supported.\nPokemon GO Ending Support for the Following Devices\n- Samsung Galaxy S4, S5, Note 3, J3\n- Sony Xperia Z2, Z3\n- Motorola Moto G (1st generation)\n- LG Fortune, Tribute\n- OnePlus One\n- HTC One (M8)\n- ZTE Overture 3\n- Certain Android devices released before 2015\nThe message from the developers suggests that players whose phones will be affected should save their log-in information for the game in a safe place, as they will still be able to log into their accounts after upgrading to a more current phone model. However, until they've acquired phones that can still support the game after the March and June updates go live, they'll be unable to access their accounts, including any [Pokemon GO Pokecoins](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-go-pokecoin-price-increase-players-unhappy/) they may have purchased.\nWhile the news is bound to be disappointing for the affected players, 2025 looks to be a big year for the Pokemon franchise, with Pokemon Legends: Z-A waiting for a firm release date and rumors of other games, like remakes of Pokemon Black and White and a new installment in the Let's Go series. It's still unclear what this year will bring in Pokemon GO, but a [leaked date for a Pokemon Presents](https://gamerant.com/pokemon-presents-2025-date-leak-niantic/) show on February 27 may provide more information.",
