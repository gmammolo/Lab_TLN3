  "text": "By Bhanvi Satija, Reuters | Posted - Jan. 9, 2025 at 9:44 a.m.\nJohnson & Johnson said on Wednesday it had temporarily paused the rollout of its Varipulse heart device in the United States. (Yves Herman, Reuters)     Save Story Leer en español Read in English Estimated read time: 1-2 minutes\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nJohnson & Johnson paused the U.S. rollout of its Varipulse heart device after stroke reports. The pause follows four stroke events, affecting patients in the U.S. and Europe. NEW YORK — Johnson & Johnson said on Wednesday it temporarily paused the rollout of its Varipulse heart device in the United States as the company investigates four reported stroke events.\nThe Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience, a database of medical device reports submitted to the FDA by manufacturers, shows a patient enrolled in a Varipulse study had a stroke shortly after treatment.\nIt adds that at least two other patients in Europe had similar complications.\nRivals Boston Scientific and Medtronic stock Wednesday with at least two analysts saying Johnson & Johnson's pause could be beneficial for the two companies.\n\"We think this delay should most significantly benefit (Boston's) Farapulse,\" JP Morgan analyst Robbie Marcus said in a note.\nJohnson & Johnson had also paused the international rollout last year and feedback from doctors for the device has been mixed, he added.\nVaripulse, which uses a pulsed-field ablation technique to treat certain abnormal heart rhythm conditions, received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November.\nJohnson & Johnson said it had initiated the pause on Jan. 5, after completing more than 130 cases as part of the U.S. rollout. The company did not provide details on when it expects to resume the launch.\n\"We are working diligently to complete the investigation according to our medical safety processes and resume the U.S. External Evaluation,\" Johnson & Johnson said in a statement.\nAn external evaluation is a limited rollout intended to collect doctors' feedback on new technology before a broader full release.\nThe company added that commercial activity and cases outside the United States would not be affected by the pause.\nGlobally, the Varipulse rollout has been successful, with over 3,000 commercial cases completed, Johnson & Johnson said.\nContributing: Puyaan Singh and Sriparna Roy\n× The Key Takeaways for this article were generated with the assistance of large language models and reviewed by our editorial team.
