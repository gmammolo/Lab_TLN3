  "text": "JAKARTA, Jan 8 — Indonesia today upheld a ban on iPhone 16 sales despite Apple’s US$1 billion (RM4.5 billion) pledge to invest in the country after a negotiation deadlock, citing the company’s failure to meet domestic market requirements.Indonesia in October prohibited the marketing and sale of the iPhone 16 model over Apple’s failure to meet local investment regulations requiring that 40 per cent of phones be made from local parts as the country seeks to boost investments from giant tech companies.",
