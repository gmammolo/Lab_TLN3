  "text": "Ubisoft needs \"a few additional weeks\".\nUbisoft has again delayed Assassin’s Creed Shadows, now pushing the title back to 21 March 2025 here in Australia.\nThe title was delayed from November to 14 February 2025 back in September of last year.\n“Since November, we’ve been thrilled to share our progress through Gameplay Overviews, and the overwhelming excitement has truly inspired us,” Ubisoft’s Marc-Alexis Cote wrote.\n“While we’ve made remarkable strides, we believe a few additional weeks are needed to implement that feedback and ensure an even more ambitious and engaging day-one experience.”\nUbisoft has promised “more updates” on the progress of Shadows soon.\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows is now scheduled for a 21 March 2025 release on Windows PC via Steam, Ubisoft Connect, and Epic Games Store alongside Mac, Amazon Luna, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, and PS5.\nThis article may contain affiliate links, meaning we could earn a small commission if you click-through and make a purchase.
