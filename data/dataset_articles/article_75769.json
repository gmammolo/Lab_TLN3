  "text": "KALAMAZOO, Mich. — Multiple school districts, including Kalamazoo and Paw Paw Public Schools, were impacted by a global PowerSchool data breach.\nPowerSchool, who serves as both districts' student information system provider, discovered the breach on Dec. 28, Kalamazoo Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Darrin Slade stated in a letter to families.\nSpecifically, logs provided by PowerSchool showed basic information such as names, addresses, grade levels, and demographics of students at Kalamazoo Public Schools were exported.\nKPS staff members' names and school emails were also accessed, according to Slade.\nSocial security numbers, however, were not exported or accessed as Kalamazoo Public Schools does not store them in PowerSchool, Slade noted.\nIt is unclear what information at Paw Paw Public Schools was affected by the breach.\n\"When PowerSchool became aware of the breach, they notified law enforcement, locked down the system, and engaged the services of CyberSteward, a professional advisor experienced in dealing with threat actors,\" Slade said.\nHe continued, \"KPS has confirmed that this is the only information that was remotely accessed. PowerSchool has received reasonable assurance that all of the copied data has been destroyed by the threat actor and does not believe this data will be made public.\"\nAfter being notified and given more details about the breach, KPS contacted their cyber insurance carrier to engage professionals and response teams \"should their services become necessary,\" according to Slade.\n\"Kalamazoo Public Schools is committed to protecting the security and privacy of all data, in PowerSchool and all other systems we utilize,\" Slade said. \"The district uses two-factor authentication for an extra layer of protection and requires staff to participate in security training and testing. We will do everything we can to fully understand this situation.\"\nPaw Paw Public Schools Superintendent Jeremy Davison echoed a similar statement, saying Paw Paw Public Schools takes the district's safety and security seriously. He issued the following statement:\n\"As part of our ongoing commitment to these values, we would like to share information about a recent unauthorized access of information that occurred involving PowerSchool, the district's third-party student information system. We were recently informed that an incident took place in which an unauthorized party gained access to certain PowerSchool student information system (SIS) data in school districts nationwide. While we have been assured by PowerSchool that this incident has been resolved, our technology staff and the technology staff at the Van Buren Intermediate School District, who hosts PowerSchool for our district, are carefully checking at the local level to be thorough and diligent for our students and families. Should there be any future developments or actions required, those affected will be notified.\"\nBoth schools are expected to share any updates and future developments with families as more information becomes available.\nAs of Thursday, PowerSchool is working with cybersecurity experts to investigate the incident and monitor for data leaks, according to Slade.",
