  "text": "Ubisoft has just announced that Assassin’s Creed: Shadows has been delayed until March 20th. The game was meant to come out on February 14th . So, we’re basically talking about a one-month delay.\nUbisoft claims that this extra time will allow its dev team to further polish the game. This is the second time that AC: Shadows has been delayed as Ubisoft was initially planning to release the game on November 15th.\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows takes place in 16th-century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era. In this game, you will live the intertwined stories of Naoe and Yasuke. Against the backdrop of the turbulent late Sengoku period, this duo will discover their common destiny as they usher in a new era for Japan.\nThe game promises to have spectacular castle towns, bustling ports, peaceful shrines, and pastoral landscapes. Ubisoft also claims that AC: Shadows will have unpredictable weather, changing seasons, and reactive environments.\nJust yesterday, Ubisoft shared some new videos that showcased the new parkour system of this new AC game. In December 2024, it also shared more details about its combat mechanics . So, I suggest reading those articles.\nFinally, AC: Shadows will not require a mandatory internet connection to play . However, it will be using the Denuvo anti-tamper tech . Since this is Assassin’s Creed we’re talking about, I don’t expect Ubisoft to remove it via a post-launch update. That’s a bummer but hey, it is what it is\nStay tuned for more!",
