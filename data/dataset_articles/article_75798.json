  "text": "09-01-2025 10:50 PM\nE bay keep changing and updating the pages and the way the various bits work so it’s getting more and more complex. Maybe not for young people but it’s getting to a point where it takes me a long time to learn something then they change it is it possible to reset e bay to the older system that was in place about a year ago, without all the seller information all the ai stuff, just basic. It’s getting so complex I can’t find or sort much as it seems everything is changing. Getting to a point where I’m likely going to stop using e bay.\n09-01-2025 11:27 PM\nIs this any better?\nhttps://www.ebay.co.uk/mys/overview?MyEbay&gbh=1&source=GBH",
