  "text": "3 CVEs added to CISA's catalog Cybercriminals are actively exploiting two vulnerabilities in Mitel MiCollab, including a zero-day flaw – and a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server that has been abused for at least five years.\nHere are the three, all of which the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog based on evidence of active exploitation:\nCVE-2024-41713 Mitel MiCollab Path Traversal Vulnerability: Patch available, data leakage or deletion possible by unauthenticated users\nCVE-2024-55550 Mitel MiCollab Path Traversal Vulnerability: Patch not available, data leakage to authenticated admin users\nCVE-2020-2883 Oracle WebLogic Server Unspecified Vulnerability: Patch available, remote-code execution through deserialization\nTwo of the three – Mitel's CVE-2024-41713, and Oracle's CVE-2020-2883 – have been fixed by the respective vendors, while CVE-2024-55550 remains in flux; security researchers have sounded warnings for months about these Mitel bugs and for years about Oracle's.\nIt goes without saying, but if you haven't already: Get patching ASAP, if you can. Miscreants have a head start in this race.\nThe two Mitel flaws affect the vendor's MiCollab product in versions 9.8 SP1 FP2 (9.8.1.201) and earlier. Both are path traversal vulnerabilities, with one (CVE-2024-41713) receiving a critical 9.8 CVSS rating and the other (CVE-2024-55550) a low-severity 2.7 score.\nMiCollab is a widely used enterprise collaboration tool with a range of features including voice, video, chat messaging, SMS, web…\nJessica Lyons",
