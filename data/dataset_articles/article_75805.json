  "text": "China faces outright ban while others vie for Uncle Sam's favor The Biden administration is reportedly weighing new limits in the ongoing US-China trade war, which would ban high-end AI accelerators to adversary nations and impose restrictions on AI models for others.\nCiting anonymous sources, Bloomberg reports the new rules, which could come as early as Friday — 10 days before president-elect Donald Trump returns to the white house — would categorize nations into three progressively more restrictive tiers.\nUnsurprisingly, the last and most restrictive of these tiers is aimed at China, Russia, and other nations subject to US export embargoes, and is said to seek an outright ban on exports of AI hardware.\nBy comparison, the first and least restrictive of these tiers would be allowed unfettered import of American designed AI chips by companies located in the US and 18 other close allies, including Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan, according to the report.\nThe second tier, meanwhile, would establish import limits on the volume of compute power the rest of the world is able to maintain, effectively establishing the US as the global gatekeeper for AI development.\nThese limits include caps on computing power available to any one nation reportedly equivalent to 50,000 GPUs over a two year period between 2025 and 2027.\nHowever, the severity of these limits on \"tier-2\" nations depends on whether or not governments are willing to abide by US trade policy. Tier-2 nations that agree to Uncle Sam's national security and human rights policies would be granted…\nTobias Mann",
