  "text": "The honors are dubious, but boy, so is the tech ces The Consumer Electronics Show is back to showcase not just the cutting edge of innovation but also the worst of what's possible when modern tech collides with today's culture of capitalist excess.\nAs they have for the past several years, a group of repairability, sustainability, and privacy advocates have come together to present the CES Worst in Show awards again this year. Six categories of failure are awarded by the participants annually, with products being lampooned for being unrepairable, insecure, privacy nightmares, environmentally unfriendly, generally unasked for, and just plain worst of the show.\nAnd boy, are there some doozies to catalog from Las Vegas this year.\nYoutube Video\nA $2,200 smart ring with a short-lived battery?\nTaking the prize for the least repairable is the Ultrahuman Rare, described by the company as the \"world's first luxury smart ring,\" which likely puts it in the running for the \"who asked for this\" prize, too.\niFixit CEO Kyle Wiens, who presented the award for Ultrahuman's repairability fail, said that despite a price tag of $2,200, the Rare's battery is only rated for 500 charge cycles, and replacing it is impossible without destroying the ring.\n\"Luxury items may be fleeting, but two years of use for $2,200 is a new low,\" iFixit said of the ring. To be fair to Ultrahuman, it says the Rare - which seems to have the same internals as its more modestly priced $349 Air ring - is able to hold a charge for up to six days. At 500 charge cycles, this translates to just over eight years of potential use, assuming minimal degradation, which means it would likely be obsolete by the time the battery dies. Either way, you're still out more than two grand for the privilege.\nThe smart crib that is always watching\nBosch took to CES to demonstrate its \"Revol\" smart crib that uses AI to keep an eye on its occupant via a camera, microphone and even a radar sensor.\n\"One of the things we hate most at EFF is products that play on people's…\nBrandon Vigliarolo",
