After my working hrs before 7pm phone call useless as technical team not working anymore. How can this be reported and fixed???!!!!\n56 minutes ago\nOK, well that means your fibre connection is down. Try switching off the ONT for 30 minutes and then power it up again. And do complete your community profile as I mentioned earlier.\nyesterday\nLOS is in red\nyesterday\nIs the ONT showing as connected?\nIf you would like the support team to look into this for you make sure that your personal details including TalkTalk phone number or account number are complete on your community profile (click here) so that they can link your forum identity with your account and then wait for them to respond.",
