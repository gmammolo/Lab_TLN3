Does anyone here use Apple's icloud for email alongside their hide-my-email function? Does it work well for you? I'm starting to feel that Proton is not very reliable.\nRe: Proton outage AGAIN - other options?\nI’m currently looking for other options as well. Glad protonmail isn’t my main account; it’s starting to feel undependable.\nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/viewtopic.php?p=8199314&sid=3ce25fef77f0846a2ba425de38855caf#p8199314\nHello, I find the iCloud+ HIde My Email useful. Managing is easy and if not on an Apple device the Browser version of iCloud can do everything needed. Extra clicks yes but the aliases are labeled and easy to find.\n-\n- Posts:\n1821 - Joined: Wed Mar 28, 2012 7:06 pm\nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/viewtopic.php?p=8199372&sid=3ce25fef77f0846a2ba425de38855caf#p8199372\nSaw this post then logged into my Proton account.

Their response to the last one was pretty horrendous - they made more efforts to keep people informed this time. But I can't have an email service that keeps going down during business hours. I wish they'd focus more on their core products and less on things like creating wallets, etc.\nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/viewtopic.php?p=8199843&sid=3ce25fef77f0846a2ba425de38855caf#p8199843\nThanks! I'm ok with the extra clicks. Their service seems like it does pretty much everything the proton service does in terms of keeping your email hidden, so I may give it a try.\nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/viewtopic.php?p=8199846&sid=3ce25fef77f0846a2ba425de38855caf#p8199846\nI use both Proton & iCloud. Yes iCloud works great. Just keep in mind it is not E2EE like Proton.\n-\nMindBogler - Posts:\n1486 - Joined: Wed Apr 17, 2013 12:05 pm\nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/viewtopic.php?p=8199869&sid=3ce25fef77f0846a2ba425de38855caf#p8199869\nI was inconvenienced by this today while trying to sign some loan documents. I also work in this field and I am satisfied with their root cause analysis, communication frequency and their ongoing migration plan. For laymen, the migration they are currently performing is technically complex and \"stuff\" happens. The biggest game in town, Office 365, also has issues from time to time. When you're running this kind of infrastructure at scale, things can and do happen.",
