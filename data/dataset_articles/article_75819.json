  "text": "Breaking News: Monkeypox Virus Threatens Netherlands ; Expert Warns of Potential Spread\nB automóvel, NL — The Netherlands braces for a potential monkeypox outbreak as the virus , previously contained in Africa, gains traction worldwide. Tilburg-based microbiologist Dr. Hans Zalm provides insights into what this threat means for the Netherlands.\nMonkeypox, a rare viral infection with symptoms similar to smallpox, has recently surfaced in Europe and North America, fueling concerns about a global spread. With the first case of the mpox variant reported in France this week, experts warn that the Netherlands could be next.\n\"Given the current global situation, it’s only a matter of time before we see a case in the Netherlands,\" says Dr. Zalm, a renowned microbiologist at Tilburg University. \"The virus is spreading, and it’s no longer confined to remote areas in Africa.\"\nThe monkeypox virus is contagious, spreading through close contact with infected individuals or their contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, swollen lymph nodes, and a distinctive rash that develops into fluid-filled lesions.\nAlthough mortality rates are low—around 1% in the current outbreak—Dr. Zalm cautions that the virus poses a significant threat, particularly to immunocompromised individuals and healthcare workers.\n\"We must not underestimate this virus,\" he warns. \"It has the potential to cause an outbreak, and we should prepare accordingly.\"\nDr. Ab Osterhaus, another prominent Dutch virologist, echoes these concerns. In an interview with Telegraaf.nl , he warns that mpox could reach the Netherlands and encourages vigilance: \"There’s a chance that this virus could also spread to the Netherlands.\"\nAs European countries like Spain, Portugal, and Belgium report monkeypox cases, experts advise the Netherlands to step up surveillance and preparedness efforts. Dr. Zalm urges the public to stay informed and follow hygiene guidelines to minimize the risk of transmission.\n\"Personal hygiene measures, like regular handwashing and avoiding close contact with infected individuals, can help prevent the spread of this virus,\" he says.\nWhile fears of a monkeypox pandemic are unfounded, given its lower transmissibility compared to SARS-COV-2, the Netherlands remains vigilant against this emerging threat. Ducks and swans in the country’s waterways may soon receive a new visitor, and understanding the potential impact is crucial for preparing an effective response.",
