  "text": "San Francisco-based Salesforce, among the world's most-valued software companies, said it will not be hiring any more engineers this year amid significant productivity boosts from AI, its chief executive officer (CEO) Marc Benioff revealed last month.Benioff told the 20 VC with Harry Stebbings podcast that the cloud giant was in the midst of doing its business plan for next year, and Agentforce - the company's flagship artificial intelligence (AI) product - was the only thing that really matters today. In a long-ranging conversation with the venture capitalist, Benioff outlined the reasons why his company decided to implement the hiring freeze. When asked if Salesforce would have more or fewer employees in five years, he said he thinks the company will probably be larger . We're not adding any more software engineers next year because we have increased the productivity this year with Agentforce and with other AI technology that we're using for engineering teams by more than 30% to the point where our engineering velocity is incredible. I can't believe what we're achieving in engineering, the CEO said. And then, we will have less support engineers next year because we have an agentic layer. We will have more salespeople next year because we really need to explain to people exactly the value that we can achieve with AI. So, we will probably add another 1,000 to 2,000 salespeople in the short term, he added.Arundhati Bhattacharya, chairperson and CEO, Salesforce India, also told ET last month that AI will enable the workforce to expand their capabilities. If you look at people, consumers, all our demands are not met. You go into a state hospital, the doctors are overworked. Workforce is limited by the number of hours that they have at their disposal. What AI actually can do is to unlimit this limitation. Your employment opportunities will go up, maybe the roles will be different. Transition would be a little painful, but it will happen. Salesforce doubled its India headcount in the country in the last few years, Bhattacharya told ET in September.",
