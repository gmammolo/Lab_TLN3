  "text": "My game is nonstop crashing. I can play for maybe 5 minutes at a time. I have no mods, I've verified my files, my drivers are all freshly installed, and I have a fairly high-end PC. I've tried running in windowed mode instead of fullscreen and knocked down my graphics settings. Nothing has changed. Is there anything else I can do? I will be attaching a dxdiag log, because I am at a total loss.",
