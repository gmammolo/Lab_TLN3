  "text": "Battlefield not installing on EA app\nWhen I try to install Battlefield 1 on the EA app, it gets stuck on \"Preparing\" at 2%, and when I try to press pause or cancel, it does not let me. I try to close the EA app, nothing happens. I open task manager, end the EA app task, and task manager along with the EA app crash, slowing down my whole PC. I have to restart, and when I go into the download location of the app, I see an 80GB Battlefield 1 folder. I open the EA app again thinking it has installed, then it asks me to download it again as if it never started, and I have to delete the large folder to make space for a new installation. This happens every time I try to download the game. I have cleared cache, I have reinstalled the EA app, I don't know what to do - I just want to play the game",
