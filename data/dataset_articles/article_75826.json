  "text": "I recently upgraded to a new pc and installed the Sims 3 with all its DLC back in the fall (I forget the exact time frame) and initially had no issues whatsoever running the game. Just within the last few weeks however I've been attempting to run the game only for it to crash when I hit play in the launcher with no accompanying error message. I've applied the Alder Lake patch and attempted to use the Powershell method (granted I'm not entirely certain I did so correctly) and have both repaired and reinstalled the game multiple times with no success. I'm at my wit's end as up until fairly recently I've had no issues with the game. I last played it successfully back in late October/early November (if I recall correctly) and only encountered this issue within the last week or so. I have enclosed for the benefit of ourselves the dxdiag report as well as the error log(s). Let me know if any additional information is needed or if what I've provided here is not what was needed. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.",
