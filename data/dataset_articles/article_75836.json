  "text": "Some of the world’s most popular apps are likely being co-opted by dishonest members of the advertising industry to collect sensitive location data on a mass scale, and that data ends up at a location data company whose subsidiary has previously sold location data global to US law enforcement.\nThe thousands of applications, included in pirated files from location data company Gravy Analytics, includes everything from games like candy crush and dating apps like Tinder to pregnancy tracking and religious prayer apps on both Android and iOS. Because much of the collection occurs through the advertising ecosystem (not code developed by the app creators themselves), it is likely that this data collection occurs without the knowledge of users or even app developers. applications.\n“For the first time publicly, we appear to have evidence that one of the largest data brokers that sells to commercial and government customers appears to be acquiring its data from online advertising ‘bid streams,’ rather than from code embedded in the own applications. Zach Edwards, a senior threat analyst at cybersecurity firm Silent Push who has followed the location data industry closely, tells 404 Media after reviewing some of the data.\nThe data provides a rare insight into the world of real-time bidding (RTB). Historically, location data companies paid app developers to include code packages that collect your users’ location data. Instead, many companies have resorted to Obtain location information through the advertising ecosystem. where companies bid to place ads within applications. But a side effect is that data brokers can listen in on that process and collect the locations of people’s cell phones.\n“This is a nightmare scenario for privacy, because not only does this data breach contain data extracted from RTB systems, but there is also a company acting as a global honey badger, doing as it pleases with every piece of data it is presented to him. says Edwards.\nIncluded in the hacked Gravy data are tens of millions of mobile phone coordinates from devices within the US, Russia and Europe. Some of those files also reference an app next to each location data. 404 Media extracted the app names and created a list of the mentioned apps.\nThe list includes dating sites Tinder and Grindr; massive games like candy crush , temple race , subway surfers and Harry Potter: puzzles and spells ; Moovit transit app; My Period Calendar & Tracker, a period tracking app with over 10 million downloads; the popular fitness app MyFitness Pro; Tumblr social network; Yahoo email client; Microsoft’s Office 365 app; and Flightradar24 flight tracker. The list also mentions multiple religion-focused apps, such as Muslim prayer and Christian Bible apps, several pregnancy trackers, and many VPN apps, which some users may download, ironically, in an attempt to protect their privacy.\nThe full list can be found here . Multiple security researchers have published other lists of applications included in the data, of different sizes. Our version is relatively larger because it includes Android and iOS apps, and we decided to keep duplicate instances of the same app that had slight name variations to make it easier for readers to search for apps they have installed.\nAlthough this data set came from an apparent Gravy hack, it is unclear whether Gravy collected this location data itself or obtained it from another company, or which location company owns or is licensed to use it.",
