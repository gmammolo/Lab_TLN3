  "text": "By Jenna Deml ,\n5 hours ago\nPORTLAND, Ore. ( KOIN ) — Two men were arrested after Portland police conducted their first online child exploitation mission this past weekend, officials said.\nPPB partnered with the FBI, the Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office and other local police to work the mission, which resulted in the two men attempting to meet up with someone they believed were minors, according to police.\nHowever, the men were instead met by officers and arrested, authorities said.\nSedan driver killed in fatal Tigard crash identified Both 38-year-old Justin Larson and 35-year-old Jesse Pitre were booked into the Multnomah County Detention Center on various charges, including luring a minor, first and second-degree online sexual corruption of a child, third-degree attempted rape and third-degree attempted sodomy.\n“I want child predators to be worried when they go online,” said PPB Lieutenant Nathan Sheppard. “I want them to know that we’re actively working to identify and arrest them. My investigators and I, and all of our law enforcement partners who worked this mission, are passionate about keeping the children of Portland safe.”\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
