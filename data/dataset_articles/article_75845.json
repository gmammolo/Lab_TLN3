  "text": "Share via Text Message RCMP file photo. Listen to this article 00:01:06 Whitehorse RCMP are warning Yukoners to be wary of suspicious emails claiming to be sent by the police.\nIn a news release published Jan. 8, the RCMP said they've received a report of an extortion email claiming to be from the RCMP.\nThey say the e-mail was titled as a legal document, like a subpoena would be, and the email message accuses the recipient of serious criminal charges. It goes on to ask they respond by email.\nThe release said the email message may also include the RCMP crest, and the Government of Canada logo.\nThe RCMP say this email is a scam.\n\"Law enforcement will never demand payment and will not threaten arrest by email. If in doubt, contact your local RCMP detachment directly,\" reads the release.\nRCMP are asking any possible victims to contact their local police and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.\nContact Talar Stockton at talar.stockton@yukon-news.com\nSee a typo/mistake?
