  "text": "The ranked system for showdown only works for a handful of people, and if your not that handful of people that game will consistently crash, and your rep will not even move past bronze 3, ive won 30 games and im still bronze 3, mean while i have people on my friends list top 100 already. the update was good in spirit but per usual you guys had done a horrible job with the execution, i cant wait until ESG comes and takes your player base because all yall do is half do everything other than your precious MUT which i will NEVER PLAY. fix your game",
