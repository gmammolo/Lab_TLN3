  "text": "TOLEDO, Ohio (WTVG) - A popular platform for school districts to keep track of student records and communicate with families was hit by a data breach last month that has just come to light.It’s called PowerSchool and it’s probably a familiar name for many in the 13 Action News viewers. It’s a cloud-based software platform used in K-12 schools.Sylvania City Schools came forward Thursday afternoon to say their platform was not involved. Now a local expert is discussing what risk this could post for any districts that were affected. He said the data breach is certainly a cause for concern, but there is no need for parents to panic.Jason Slagle is the president of CNWR Consultants, a local IT consulting firm that focuses on providing tech support for small businesses.“This program is used by schools all over the nation,” Slagle told 13 Action News.He also has two children who go to school in a local district that uses the software platform. “PowerSchool is a student information system. So what it does is provide services such as grade book, student tracking, scheduling and other resources that schools use to operate essentially. You can’t do that stuff on paper anymore, so almost every district uses some kind of electronic system to do its record keeping,” Slagle said.Slagle said the information that was exposed was mainly contact information, but in some cases it could include social security numbers.“It definitely has name, date of birth, parent contact information, their entire schedule and grades, all of that information that schools require to operate,” Slagle said.According to PowerSchool, someone used compromised credentials to access student and teacher information through one of PowerSchool’s community-focused customer support portals. “The school districts did nothing wrong. They chose what is considered a best in class product to do this work and keep track of these records for them,” Slagle said.So if your district is impacted by the breach, what can you do?“One of the things you can do is monitor your credit. If you have older children, they are able to get credit, and if you do have seniors in high school you wouldn’t want the threat actors to open credit cards in their name,” Slagle said.PowerSchool is trying to assure families that it is staying on top of this. The company said in a statement:“We have taken all appropriate steps to prevent the data involved from further unauthorized access or misuse.”It went on to say “we are equipped to conduct a thorough notification process to all impacted individuals.”If you haven’t already heard from your school district, Slagle said you should reach out and ask if your district was impacted.
