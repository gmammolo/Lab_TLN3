  "text": "Never before have so many cases of melanoma been estimated as last year. In the latest report “Cancer numbers in Italy 2024″, presented by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology, there are forecasts that indicate that melanoma diagnoses could reach 17,000, approximately 4,300 more than the 12,700 recorded in 2023. ” The possibility that the past year will be a ‘black’ year is high. Of course, this high number can be interpreted both as a greater sensitivity of the population to undergo regular checks, which are fundamental for an early diagnosis of cancer, and as a greater exposure to risk factors, for example to sun rays without adequate protection or the resort to tanning beds,” he comments Paolo Ascierto president of the Melanoma Foundation and director of the Melanoma Oncology, Oncological Immunotherapy and Innovative Therapies Unit of the Pascale Institute of Naples. “However, this balance of diagnoses is contrasted with the exceptional successes in therapy. In fact, thanks to immunotherapy – continues Ascierto – even in cases of metastatic melanoma , the most serious forms and against which until recently we had few treatment options, today 50% of patients survive 10 years after diagnosis”.\nHow to recognize a suspicious mole: what and where to check\nThe new guidelines\nThis is why in the new European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) melanoma guidelines, published only recently, immunotherapy has gone from being the last option to first-line therapy. “Melanoma – says Ascierto – is one of the main tumors that arise at a young age and is currently the third most frequent tumor in Italy in both sexes under the age of 50. Over the last 20 years its incidence has increased dramatically, going from 6,000 cases in 2004 to 11,000 in 2014, up to a possible 17,000 in 2024.” The chances of survival have also increased progressively and significantly over the years, especially thanks to immunotherapy which occupies a prominent place in the latest ESMO guidelines . The new recommendations were developed by a multidisciplinary group of experts from Europe, the United States and Australia and are based on the latest scientific data. “In the document, adjuvant immunotherapy , post-surgery, is recommended both in cases of stage IIB and IIC melanoma, and stage III, therefore also in the presence of metastatic disease – explains Ascierto -. Adjuvant immunotherapy is also indicated as the first option in cases of metastatic melanoma, before or instead of target therapy. Furthermore, in the new guidelines there is the so-called ‘dual block’ immunotherapy, the one composed of two drugs that act on two different ‘blocks’ of inhibition of the immune system, recently made reimbursable by the Italian Medicines Agency in cases of non-melanoma. resectable or metastatic”.\nMelanoma: watch out for ‘tanning’ in the snow, only 1 in 10 is protected\n06 December 2024\nAs expected, the experts also included neoadjuvant immunotherapy in their recommendations, i.e. that which is administered before surgery, in cases of metastatic melanoma. “The new guidelines take into account the enormous progress made in the diagnosis and treatment of this rapidly growing disease – concludes Ascierto -. But even if therapies evolve rapidly, one point remains firm and always valid and it is prevention which remains our best weapon against melanoma.”\nTumors: immunotherapy increasingly widespread, but 80% of centers are not organized on adverse events\nNovember 26, 2024\n#Melanoma #diagnoses #increase\n–",
