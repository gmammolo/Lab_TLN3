  "text": "KYODO NEWS - 12 hours ago - 22:43 | All , Japan At least 46 entities in Japan, including banks and government agencies, have been targeted by cyberattacks likely utilizing the same malware since the end of last year, a major internet security firm said Thursday.\nAccording to Trend Micro Inc., Japan Airlines Co., NTT Docomo Inc. and major banks were among the victims of distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attacks in which networks are overwhelmed by data from multiple sources over a short period, causing temporary service suspensions.\nPhoto taken in Tokyo on Dec. 26, 2024, shows a Japan Airlines smartphone app out of order due to a system glitch, caused by a cyberattack earlier in the day. (Kyodo) ==Kyodo The Japan Weather Association said on Thursday it was hit by a cyberattack that rendered its information website inaccessible for over nine hours from around 7 a.m.\nA similar cyberattack on Sunday that affected both the web and app versions of the weather site took over 7 hours to resolve.\nAccording to Trend Micro, the hackers are believed to have used a botnet, or a network of computers and other internet-connected devices infected by malware used to carry out the attacks.\nUpon investigating the incident against JAL, Trend Micro uncovered instructions to attack the IP addresses of the affected entities through a specific botnet. There were also signs of similar assaults in the United States and Europe.\n\"We can't rule out the possibility that multiple groups conducted attacks at the same time,\" a Trend Micro official said.\nThe hackers were able to simultaneously control devices including cameras and home appliances connected to the internet to carry out the attacks, the security firm said.",
