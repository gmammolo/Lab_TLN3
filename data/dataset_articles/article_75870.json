  "text": "52m ago\nHello,\nI have a strange problem with the chromecast.\ni can see the menu of the tv and i see the startup of the chromecast but when i want to stream there is audio but no video. The chromecast works fine on a other tv. It worked fine on this tv yesterday, but since today only audio. All the apps are up to date, all the cables are good since it worked on a other tv. I tried resetting the tv and the chromecast but it didnt work. The chromecast and phone are connected on the same wifi. The google home app says its streaming and working fine. Searched and tried all thing i came across on the internet but nothing works. Hope u people have a solution, thanks in advance",
