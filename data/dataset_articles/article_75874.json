PC Client\nOS Version PC\nAlly Code: (Find it here: http://bit.ly/AllyCode )\nWhat type of issue do you have? Gameplay\nHow often does the bug occur? Every time (100%)\nSummarize your bug When a mechanic like Exile stops Fulcrum's unique from cleansing herself, she taxes herself every turn anyway as if she successfully cleansed, causing her to take hundreds of thousands of free damage. I suspect the same interaction happens with other blockers like Isolate or Plague.\nSteps: How can we find the bug ourselves? Place a dispellable debuff on Ahsoka Tano (Fulcrum) while she has Exile. Note that she deals 15% of her Health every turn, despite not successfully cleansing anything.\nConnection Type\nPlease select your region\nCountry\n‌\nWhen a mechanic like Exile stops Fulcrum's unique from cleansing herself, she taxes herself every turn anyway as if she successfully cleansed, causing her to take hundreds of thousands of free damage.
