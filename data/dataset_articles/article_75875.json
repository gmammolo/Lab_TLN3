  "text": "One of Dead by Daylight's newest features already has an ominous omission that can hopefully be corrected in the future. [Dead by Daylight](https://gamerant.com/db/video-game/dead-by-daylight/) has seen a lot of new ideas throughout 2024; with a few new chapters introducing new Survivors and Killers, as well as a few limited-time modes coming and going, the developers have shown plenty of innovation over the past year. Despite all of this though, there is one obvious idea that has evaded the game completely.\nThe amount of [outfits in Dead by Daylight](https://gamerant.com/dead-daylight-best-survivor-outfits/) that players can unlock for Survivors and Killers alike is a key aspect of the game. The ability to add a personal touch to characters with cosmetics both earned and bought has been a boon for players throughout the game's lifespan. This also extends to the charms that players can equip to their Survivor's belt or Killer's hooks. Aside from occasional changes in visibility, these cosmetics have no real effect on Dead by Daylight's gameplay. That said, it's hard to imagine the game at this point without a variety of ways to dress up its characters.\n[Related\n](/dead-by-daylight-michael-myers-iridescent-nerf-infinite-mori-build/)\n[\nDead by Daylight: How Michael Myers' Rework Devastated One Playstyle\n](/dead-by-daylight-michael-myers-iridescent-nerf-infinite-mori-build/)\nMichael Myers has one of Dead by Daylight's deadliest builds, but it was just dealt a severe blow by the game's latest update.\nDead by Daylight's Badge Collection is Missing its Biggest Assets\nBadges and Banners Let Dead by Daylight Players Customize Their Profiles\nBadges and banners were introduced alongside [Chucky's debut in Dead by Daylight](https://gamerant.com/dead-by-daylight-chucky-gameplay-strategies-rules-stealth-pallets/) as an additional way for players to accessorize. Badges and banners act as profile pictures and wallpapers, respectively, and appear on the player's own lobby as well as the results screen after each game. Most badges come as rewards, being earned through either rifts or events. However, there are a few that players have been able to get from codes in the shop as well. While ultimately a small flourish, badges and banners are certainly a welcome addition. At the same time, they're missing the mark in one admittedly obvious way.\nDead by Daylight is Missing Badges For its Characters\nWith a few exceptions, there are no badges for [Dead by Daylight's Killers](https://gamerant.com/dead-by-daylight-killer-problem-licensed-properties-limited-solution/) and Survivors as of yet. This seems like an odd decision even on its surface. When one thinks of ways that players might want to represent themselves in Dead by Daylight, the game's own characters are one of the first ideas that would come to mind. Events have led to a few additions, such as Yun-Jin and Trickster badges based on their unlockable cosmetics from the latest Halloween event. Still, the fact that there aren't commonly available cosmetics for the game's playable cast makes it feel like there's something missing.\nDbD Has Multiple Ways to Make Character Badges Available\nFor a small amount of [Dead by Daylight's Iridescent Shards](https://gamerant.com/dead-by-daylight-iridescent-shards-tips-earn/), character badges could be made buyable in the shop. A second option would be to make them unlockable through the prestige system, similar to the prestige cosmetics and perk charms already available. If this method was taken, then it would have the additional perk of showing that players with said badge have put a significant amount of effort into leveling up said character. Either way, giving players the opportunity to represent themselves with their favorite character should be possible in-game.\nThere's potential for some characters to have themed banners as well, like a graffiti mural for Nea or animal masks for Huntress.\nDead by Daylight's own playable characters are the best unused inspiration for badges in the game. Hopefully, it won't be too far into [Dead by Daylight's future](https://gamerant.com/dead-by-daylight-future-crossovers-survey-franchises-list/) for such badges to make their way into the game. After all, while a lot of the current badges are interesting and have great aesthetics, it doesn't feel right to not have the game's own cast represented as Dead by Daylight's Survivors and Killers are more than deserving of their own badges in-game.\nYour comment has not been saved\nEver wished to play as one of the characters from your favorite horror movies? Dead by Daylight is a 1v4 multiplayer game that draws from all corners of the horror world from a powerful slasher to a terrifying paranormal entity.\nChoose between playing an unstoppable Killer and one of 4 Survivors trying to evade a gruesome death. Each character has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your personal strategy. Work together to escape, or stalk and sacrifice every Survivor.\nThis Edition of Dead by Daylight gives you access to a roster of 7 Killers (The Trapper, The Hillbilly, The Wraith, The Nurse, The Hag, The Huntress and The Doctor) and 9 Survivors (Meg Thomas, Claudette Morel, Jake Park, Dwight Fairfield, Ace Visconti, Nea Karlsson, Bill Overbeck, Feng Min and David King). It also includes two cosmetic add-ons packed with outfits for various characters.",
