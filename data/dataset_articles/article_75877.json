  "text": "The China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) today [announced](https://www.chinacdc.cn/jksj/jksj01/202501/t20250109_303772.html) the country's first confirmed clade 1b mpox cases, which involve a foreigner who had lived in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and four close contacts.\nIn a statement, China CDC said it quickly launched investigations that involve state and provinces, such as Zhejiang, Guangdong, Beijing, and Tianjin.\nThe four close contacts of the index case-patient mainly had mild symptoms, such as rash. No additional infections have been found among the patients' general contacts. The patients are receiving treatment and are under monitoring.\nTwelfth clade 1 appearance outside of Africa\nChina is the twelfth country outside of Africa to detect clade 1 mpox, which is different from the clade 2 mpox virus spreading globally. The novel clade 1b virus is thought to spread more easily among contacts, including in households. Most cases have been linked to travel to affected African countries.\nOutside of Africa, limited secondary transmission has now been reported in the United Kingdom, Germany, and China.\nThe clade 1b virus is driving outbreak activity in some of Africa's current hot spots, such as the DRC, where household transmission has especially affected children.",
