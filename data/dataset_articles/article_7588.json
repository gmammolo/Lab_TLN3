  "text": "UPDATE: January 7, 2026 at 8:26 p.m.\nThe westbound lanes of Interstate 90 near the Four Lakes exit and Cheney have been completely stopped as a snow squall continues to drop heavy snow and reduce visibility around Spokane.\nRoad conditions have worsened significantly in the past hour, especially in areas to the west of Spokane. Drivers are urged to avoid travel if possible as this weather event continues.\nSPOKANE, Wash. – The National Weather Service in Spokane issued a snow squall warning for north central Whitman County and eastern Spokane County. The warning is in effect until 7:15 p.m. PST.\nThe snow squall, detected at 6:46 p.m. PST, was moving northeast at 30 mph from near Airway Heights to 19 miles southeast of Cheney.\nThe squall is expected to cause flash freezing on roads, intense bursts of heavy snow, gusty winds, blowing snow and rapidly falling visibility.\nWind gusts could reach up to 20 mph, according to radar and trained spotters.\nTravel conditions are expected to become dangerous and life-threatening rapidly.\nThe warning affects Interstate 90 between mile markers 273 and 289, U.S. Highway 195 between mile markers 59 and 95, and U.S. Highway 395 between mile markers 165 and 173.\nLocations likely to be impacted include Spokane, Spokane Valley, Airway Heights, Nine Mile Falls, Millwood, Fairwood, Country Homes, Town And Country, Chattaroy, Dishman, Mead, Fairfield, Rosalia, Spangle, Latah, Waverly, Marshall, Colbert, Plaza and Valleyford.\nThe National Weather Service advises drivers to slow down and prepare for sudden changes in visibility and road conditions. Wet roadways will quickly freeze, creating black ice on roads, bridges and overpasses, making them slick and dangerous.\nBe alert for sudden whiteout conditions and exercise caution while traveling in the affected areas.\nArticle originally published January 7, 2026 at 6:54 p.m.\nFOX28 Spokane©",
