  "text": "Quick Summary: In an apparent effort to sow discord and score points with the platform's more gullible and racist users, an account called Kevin Dalton shared a picture of a number of shadowy figures walking away from a row of burning buildings.\nAs spotted by Wired senior business editor Louise Matsakis, some accounts have gone as far as to generate entirely made-up images of the resulting devastation to make unsubstantiated claims about purported looting in the city.\n Far-right hate speech incubator X is absolutely riddled with disinformation about the ongoing and devastating wildfires surrounding Los Angeles right now.",
