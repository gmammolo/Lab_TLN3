But the \"forked\" exploit PoC actually leads to the download and execution of information-stealing malware.\nLDAPNightmare is the name of the PoC for CVE-2024-49113, a 7.5-severity denial-of-service bug in LDAP patched in Microsoft's December Patch Tuesday.\nIt was one of two LDAP bugs – the other being the critical CVE-2024-49112 – addressed in Microsoft's final updates of 2024. Trend Micro researcher Sarah Pearl Camiling said that \"both vulnerabilities were deemed as highly significant due to the widespread use of LDAP in Windows environments,\" and thus of keen interest to defenders.\nIn the counterfeit PoC, the legitimate version's Python files were replaced with an executable called \"poc.exe.\" If a user ran this, it would instead drop a PowerShell script, which then downloaded and executed another script from Pastebin, collecting various data points from the user.\nThe stolen data…\nConnor Jones",
