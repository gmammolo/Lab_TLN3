While acknowledging that geopolitical conflicts and tariffs could put upward pressure on prices, he⁢ did not‌ believe the U.S. woudl ⁢implement “harsh”⁣ tariffs or trigger sustained inflation, ⁢and doubted⁤ they would significantly impact the Fed’s ⁤monetary policy stance.\nWaller pointed to the⁤ continued decline ‍in inflation, albeit at‍ a slower pace, towards the 2% target, as supporting further⁤ interest rate cuts this year. Though, he emphasized that the decision would depend on⁢ the progress of inflation reduction and the strength of the‌ labor market.\nstrong‍ Job Market Data⁤ Offers Mixed Signals\nEconomic data ⁢released Thursday showed a robust U.S.job market, with job growth slowing and layoffs declining.

Sarah Chen,​ Quantum ​Computing⁣ Expert NewDirectory3.com spoke with ⁣Dr. ‍Sarah Chen, a leading expert in quantum computing, to get her​ insights on the recent ‌market shift.\nND3: ​ dr. Chen,what do you make of⁢ the‌ recent downturn in quantum computing stocks?\n“While ​quantum computing holds ⁢immense potential to revolutionize various industries,it’s notable to remember ‌that it’s still a nascent technology.It will⁣ likely ⁢be several years before we see widespread practical applications. This recent market correction is⁤ a reminder that investors should approach this sector ​with ​a⁣ long-term perspective⁢ and ‍realistic expectations.”\nND3: Some experts have even suggested it could be decades before quantum computers with practical applications​ emerge. Do you agree?\n“While it’s tough to put a ⁢definitive timeframe on it, Jensen Huang, the President of Nvidia, recently suggested ​it could be two decades or more. I think that’s a reasonable estimate. Ther are still significant technological⁣ hurdles to overcome,and‌ building truly ⁢fault-tolerant,scalable quantum computers is an extremely complex challenge. “\nND3: What advice⁢ would you give to ​investors interested ⁤in the‌ quantum computing space?\n“Do your research. Understand the⁤ fundamentals⁢ of the technology and the challenges involved. ⁢Be patient and⁣ invest for ⁢the long haul. And remember, diversification is key. ⁤Don’t put all ⁣your eggs in one quantum basket.”\nDr. Chen’s insights echo the sentiments ‌expressed ⁢by other industry experts, emphasizing the importance of ⁤a cautious and realistic approach to⁤ investing in quantum ⁤computing. ​While the long-term potential remains vast, ⁤the road to commercialization ⁢is likely to ⁣be long and winding.",
