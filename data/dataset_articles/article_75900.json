  "text": "Sugary Drinks Fuel Millions of New Diabetes and Heart Disease Cases Worldwide A groundbreaking new study reveals the alarming link between sugary drinks and a surge in chronic diseases, highlighting the urgent need for global action.\nMillions of new cases of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) each year can be directly attributed to the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, according to a study published in Nature Medicine . Conducted by researchers at Tufts University’s Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, the research underscores the critical need for targeted interventions to curb sugary drink intake, notably in developing countries.\n<div class=\"blockText blockContent TbCXh”> Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Lead to Millions of New Diabetes, CVD Cases Yearly / elenvd – stock.adobe.com\nThe study, which analyzed data from the Global Dietary Database, found that in 2020, adults consumed an average of 2.6 eight-ounce servings of sugar-sweetened beverages per week.This intake varied considerably across regions, ranging from 0.7 servings in South Asia to 7.3 servings in latin America and the Caribbean.\nalarmingly, the researchers estimated that these sugary drinks were responsible for 2.2 million new type 2 diabetes cases and 1.2 million new cardiovascular disease cases globally in 2020 alone.\n“Sugar-sweetened beverages are heavily marketed and sold in low- and middle-income nations,” said Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine institute and senior author of the study. “Not only are these communities consuming harmful products, but thay are also often less well equipped to deal with the long-term health consequences.”\nThe countries bearing the heaviest burden of new diabetes cases linked to sugary drinks were Mexico, Colombia , and South Africa. These same countries also topped the list for new cardiovascular disease cases attributed to these beverages.\n“We need urgent, evidence-based interventions to curb consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages globally, before even more lives are shortened by their effects on diabetes and heart disease,” said Laura Lara-Castor, the study’s first author.\nThe study’s findings underscore the critical need for public health policies aimed at reducing sugary drink consumption. These coudl include taxation, restrictions on marketing, and promoting access to healthier beverage options.\nSugary Drinks: A Sweet Threat too Global Health Maria: Did you read that shocking article about sugary drinks causing millions of new diabetes and heart disease cases worldwide?\nAlex: No, I missed it. What’s going on?\nMaria: Basically, this study published in Nature Medicine found a direct link between sugary drinks and a surge in these chronic diseases. It’s incredibly alarming!\nalex: Wow, that’s scary. How many cases are we talking about?\nMaria: The researchers estimated that in 2020 alone, sugary drinks were responsible for 2.2 million new cases of type 2 diabetes and 1.2 million new cases of cardiovascular disease globally. That’s a huge number!\nAlex: I knew sugary drinks weren’t good for you, but I had no idea it was this bad. Which countries are most affected?\nMaria: According to the study, Mexico, Colombia, and South Africa are hit the hardest. These countries are also the ones where people consume the most sugary drinks, sadly.\nAlex: Is ther anything being done to address this issue?\nMaria: The study authors are calling for urgent action. They believe governments need to implement policies like taxation,restrictions on marketing these drinks,especially to children,and promoting healthier alternatives.\nAlex: That makes sense. It seems like a combination of individual choices and public health interventions is needed to tackle this problem.\nMaria: Exactly.
