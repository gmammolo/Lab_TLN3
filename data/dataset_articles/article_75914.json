Updated: 6:54 PM CST Jan 9, 2025 FAMILY. EXPERTS SAY PEOPLE WHO RAISE THEIR OWN CHICKENS NEED TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SIGNS OF H5N1. WE ARE AWARE OF WHERE OUR FOOD COMES FROM, AND WE FEEL LIKE IF WE ARE CARING FOR OUR CHICKENS AND IN CONTROL OF THE FOOD THAT THEY’RE CONSUMING WITH FREE RANGING AND THE FEED THAT WE’RE PURCHASING AND FEEDING THEM, THEN WE’RE PUTTING HEALTHIER OPTIONS INTO OUR BODY. HOMESTEADER MEREDITH PASSARELLI HAS BEEN RAISING THESE CHICKENS FOR THREE YEARS. SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE H5N1 VIRUS AND GETS ALERTS FROM THE MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. ANDREW PESCA IS WITH THE JOHNS HOPKINS BLOOMBERG SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. H5N1 IS WHAT WE CALL AN AVIAN INFLUENZA VIRUS. IT’S RELATED TO THE HUMAN INFLUENZA VIRUSES THAT WE’RE STARTING TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT INFECTIONS NOW HERE IN THE U.S., BUT IT’S BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH MUCH MORE SEVERE DISEASE, AND IT’S A VIRUS THAT WE HAVE NO PREEXISTING IMMUNITY TO IN THE POPULATION. AND THEREFORE, IT’S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER A POTENTIAL PANDEMIC VIRUS. HE SAYS THE RISK TO THE GENERAL POPULATION IS LOW. UNLESS YOU WORK ON A DAIRY FARM OR WORK ON A POULTRY FARM. BUT WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE PASSARELLI? SOON AS YOU SEE YOUR CHICKENS LOOKING VERY SICK OR DYING, I WOULD TREAT THEM AS IF THEY WERE POTENTIALLY INFECTED WITH THIS VIRUS. PASSARELLI SAYS SHE CHECKS OUT HER CHICKENS EVERY DAY, SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT SINCE SHE HAS THREE SMALL CHILDREN. WELL, THEY SAY THAT THE WILD BIRDS ARE COMMUNICATING THE DISEASE THROUGH THEIR DROPPINGS, AND THOSE OF US WHO HAVE CHICKENS LET OUR CHICKENS OUT, AND THEN THEY CAN GET SICK BY CONSUMING THE DROPPINGS. SO WHAT SHOULD HOMESTEADERS BE LOOKING FOR IN POULTRY? THE ANIMALS. BEGIN TO LOSE WEIGHT. LOSE ACTIVITY VERY QUICKLY AND AGAIN RELATIVELY QUICKLY. AFTER SEEING THOSE INITIAL SIGNS, THE ANIMALS DIE FROM INFECTION. THOSE RAISING BACKYARD CHICKENS SHOULD NOTIFY THE MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE A POTENTIAL OUTBREAK ON YOUR HANDS. Advertisement Can Bird Flu be transmitted through eggs, dairy, or poultry? A food safety expert explains Share Copy Link Copy {copyShortcut} to copy Link copied! Updated: 6:54 PM CST Jan 9, 2025 Korin Miller After months of more mild cases, the bird flu appears to be ramping up: The U.S. just saw its first death from the virus, and cases have been found in birds across all 50 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Couple that with egg shortages and rising prices, and it’s fair to have questions about the disease—including whether or not you can get bird flu from food. There have been 66 confirmed human cases of H5N1 bird flu in America, according to the CDC, with most of them happening in California, Colorado, and Washington. Most bird flu cases were found in people who worked with livestock and poultry, although two were from an unknown source, per agency data.The news might make you wonder: Can I get bird flu from food like eggs, poultry, and dairy? Here’s what a food safety expert wants you to know—plus, how to protect yourself. Can bird flu be transmitted through food?Technically, yes, bird flu can be transmitted through food. “We know that it can because already several cats have become ill and even died as a result of consuming raw milk contaminated with H5N1,” says Felicia Wu, PhD, a professor of food safety, toxicology, and risk assessment at Michigan State University.However, no instances of bird flu being transmitted to people via food or drinks have been reported during the U.S.'s current outbreak.Are eggs, dairy, and poultry safe to eat?It's important to note that eggs, dairy, and poultry are currently being closely monitored by government authorities for the presence of bird flu. When bird flu is found in a flock or group of cows, they are often culled (killed) and the food they produce is destroyed. It’s also worth noting that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is currently testing all milk in the country for bird flu. Wu stresses that you’re fine to keep eating eggs, dairy, and poultry as long as you cook them properly. (That includes making sure to only consume pasteurized—not raw—milk.)How can I protect myself from bird flu?The majority of bird flu cases in the U.S. have been from people who work with livestock or poultry, or who have handled bird flocks. If you don’t do any of those things, the risk of you contracting bird flu is currently low, since the virus has not shown signs of being transmitted between humans. From a food safety perspective, cooking poultry, eggs, and beef to the appropriate internal temperature of 165˚F kills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu, according to the CDC. It’s also important to wash your hands well after handling these products, according to the agency.
