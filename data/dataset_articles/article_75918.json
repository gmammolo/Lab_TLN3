  "text": "Hackers steal data from nationwide school software site\nQUINCY (WGEM) - Data from thousands was stolen from PowerSchool’s servers across the country.\nHacking is always a danger to those who surf the web, but schools are not usually the target. However, hackers managed to get their way into the servers of PowerSchool, a nationwide school software company.\n“It always hurts when it has to do with kids. It just doesn’t sit right,” JR Bareis, CEO of Tigerhawk Technologies explained.\nIn a recent statement, PowerSchool explained that their servers were hacked in late December due to a hacker using user credentials to log in and breach the data.\n“I think they tripped upon it and they said, ‘Oh my gosh, look what I just got. I can hold this company ransom,” Bareis said.\nThe company was able to negotiate with the hackers to make sure that none of the data was publicly disclosed, although no monetary ransom total was revealed.\nCopyright 2025 WGEM.
