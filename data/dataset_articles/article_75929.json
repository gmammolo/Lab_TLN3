  "text": "New York, January 9 (RHC)-- Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced an end to fact-checking initiatives on Facebook, Instagram and Threads. Zuckerberg announced the change in a video posted online Tuesday.\nMark Zuckerberg said: “After Trump first got elected in 2016, the legacy media wrote nonstop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy. We tried in good faith to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth. But the fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they’ve created, especially in the U.S.”\nNicole Gill, the head of Accountable Tech, called Meta’s move a “gift to Donald Trump and extremists around the world.” Wired reports Meta has also loosened its policies on what can be posted on its platforms. Wired reports Meta users will now be allowed to say gay and trans people have mental illness.\nCNN reports Facebook will also permit users to call women “household objects.” Meanwhile, Meta has appointed a close Trump ally, Dana White, to the company’s board. White is the CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship.\n[ SOURCE: DEMOCRACY NOW ]",
