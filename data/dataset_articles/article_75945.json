  "text": "In ⁤a high-stakes legal ​battle, ⁢Meta, the parent company of Facebook, is⁣ facing allegations of knowingly using pirated datasets⁢ to train its AI models. The controversy centers around the⁤ use of a ​dataset from‍ LibGen, a shadow library known for hosting copyrighted material without authorization. Plaintiffs in the case ⁢claim that Meta’s leadership, including CEO Mark​ Zuckerberg, was fully aware of the ‌dataset’s pirated nature. “Meta has treated the so-called ⁢‘public availability’ of shadow datasets as a get​ out of jail free card, notwithstanding that ‍internal Meta records show every⁤ relevant⁣ decision-maker at Meta, up to⁤ and including its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, knew LibGen was ‘a dataset we know to be⁤ pirated,’” the plaintiffs allege in a recent motion. The motion, originally filed in late 2024, seeks ‌to amend the complaint for⁤ a third time, adding new claims based on ‌evidence uncovered ⁤during the revelation process. Meta, however, has⁤ pushed back against these allegations, calling‍ the plaintiffs’ efforts an “eleventh-hour gambit based on a false and inflammatory premise.” The tech giant argues that it disclosed⁤ its ⁢use of the LibGen ‍dataset to ⁢the plaintiffs as⁤ early ‍as July 2024 and denies withholding crucial information. “Plaintiffs knew of Meta’s downloading and use of LibGen and other alleged ‘shadow libraries’ as at least mid-July 2024,” Meta’s lawyers stated in their opposition filing.\nDespite Meta’s claims, ​the plaintiffs argue ​that the discovery process⁣ has ​revealed damning evidence. They ‌allege that Meta not ⁤onyl used pirated⁤ datasets but‌ also actively participated⁢ in distributing copyrighted material. ​“Meta, through a corporate representative who testified⁢ on November 20,‍ 2024, has now admitted‍ under oath to uploading (aka ‘seeding’)‍ pirated files containing⁣ Plaintiffs’ works on ‘torrent’ sites,” the motion ‍states. Seeding,a term used in peer-to-peer file sharing,refers to the act of sharing downloaded files⁤ with other ​users,further‍ perpetuating the distribution of ‌pirated content.\nThe legal drama has ⁢also drawn attention⁣ to Meta’s handling of sensitive documents.⁤ Judge ⁣Chhabria, overseeing the case, issued‌ a stern warning to the company regarding its ‍redaction practices. “If ‌Meta ⁤again submits an ‍unreasonably broad sealing ​request, all materials will simply be unsealed,”‍ he wrote. This statement underscores the court’s commitment to clarity, even⁤ as much of the discovery material‌ remains confidential.\nAs the⁢ case unfolds, it raises critical questions about the ethical use of data ⁣in AI development.‍ The plaintiffs’ allegations, if⁤ proven, could have far-reaching implications for Meta and the broader tech industry. For now, the ⁤legal battle continues, with both sides ⁢digging ⁤in ⁣for what promises to‍ be a protracted and contentious fight.\nWhat specific policy recommendations⁤ stemming from your research ⁢have you found ⁤most impactful⁤ in influencing global climate action? Interview with Dr. ‍Evelyn Carter: Pioneering Climate Scientist and Advocate for Enduring​ Innovation\nBy Archys, Archyde News Editor\nArchyde News : Good afternoon, Dr. Carter, and thank you for⁢ joining us today. Your work in climate science and sustainable innovation has been‌ groundbreaking. To start,⁢ could you tell ​our⁢ readers a little about your journey into⁤ this field and what ⁤inspired you to dedicate ⁣your ​career to addressing climate⁢ change?\nDr. Evelyn Carter: Thank you for ​having me.‍ My journey into ⁢climate science began⁤ during my undergraduate studies in environmental science. I grew up in a small coastal town,‍ and I ‌witnessed firsthand the effects of​ rising sea levels and increasingly severe ⁣storms.It was alarming to⁢ see how quickly the surroundings around me was changing. That personal⁤ connection to ‍the issue ⁣drove me to pursue a Ph.D. in climate ⁤science, where I focused on understanding the mechanisms of climate⁣ change ⁢and developing actionable solutions to mitigate its impact.\nArchyde News : ⁤Your research has been instrumental in shaping ⁤global climate policies. What do you ​consider your‌ most critically important contribution to the ⁢field so far?\nDr. Carter: That’s a great question. I think one of the most impactful contributions has been my work‌ on developing predictive models that link climate change to specific economic and⁢ social outcomes. ⁢For example, our team created a model that ⁤predicts how rising temperatures will affect agricultural productivity in different‍ regions. This has‍ helped ‌policymakers prioritize‍ resources and develop targeted strategies⁢ to⁢ support vulnerable communities. Additionally, my advocacy for integrating renewable ⁣energy technologies into urban planning has gained traction in several cities worldwide, leading to more sustainable infrastructure projects.\nArchyde News : Speaking of renewable energy, ther’s been a lot of debate about the ⁣feasibility‍ of transitioning ​entirely to renewable⁣ sources. What’s your take on this?\nDr. Carter: The transition to renewable energy is not only feasible⁤ but essential. ⁣The technology already exists—solar, wind, and ‍geothermal energy are becoming more efficient ​and cost-effective every year. The ⁢challenge lies⁤ in scaling thes solutions and ensuring they are accessible​ to ⁤all communities, not just those in developed ​nations. We also need to address the infrastructure gaps and invest ⁣in ​energy storage solutions to manage the intermittent nature of some renewable sources. it’s⁤ a complex process, but with the right policies and investments, we can achieve a sustainable energy future.\nArchyde News : You’ve been a vocal​ advocate for interdisciplinary collaboration in tackling climate​ change. why do you believe this approach is so vital?\nDr.‌ Carter: Climate change is a ‍multifaceted ⁢issue that ‌transcends conventional academic and professional ⁣boundaries. It’s not just‍ a scientific problem—it’s an ‌economic,social,and political challenge ⁢as‌ well. by ⁢bringing together experts from‌ diverse fields—engineers, economists, sociologists,⁤ policymakers—we⁣ can develop⁢ holistic solutions that ⁣address the root causes of​ climate ⁤change‍ while also considering the human impact.‌ For instance, my recent ⁢collaboration with urban planners and‍ social‍ scientists has led to ⁢the advancement of climate-resilient housing designs that are both environmentally sustainable and affordable for low-income families.\nArchyde ⁣ News : ⁤That’s fascinating. On a more personal note, what keeps you motivated in the face of⁤ such ‌a ​daunting global⁣ challenge?\nDr.​ Carter: It’s⁣ easy to feel overwhelmed ⁤by the scale of​ the problem, but I find ⁣motivation in the progress we’ve‌ made‍ and the passion of the next generation. Young activists, scientists, and entrepreneurs are⁢ bringing ⁤fresh perspectives and innovative ideas to the ‍table. ⁤Seeing their enthusiasm reminds‌ me that change is possible. I’m also inspired by the communities I’ve worked with—people who are directly affected ⁣by climate change⁤ but are taking ‍proactive steps ⁤to ⁣adapt and thrive.Their resilience gives me hope.\nArchyde News : what ⁢message would you like to leave with our readers who might potentially be wondering how they can contribute to the fight ‍against climate change?\nDr. Carter: Every⁢ action counts. Whether it’s reducing your carbon footprint, supporting sustainable businesses, or advocating for stronger climate policies, your‌ choices matter. Educate yourself about the issues and‍ engage in conversations with⁣ others.⁢ Collective action is powerful, ⁤and together, ‍we can drive the systemic changes needed to protect our planet for future generations.\nArchyde News : Thank you,​ Dr. Carter, for sharing your insights​ and for your tireless‌ work in this ‍critical⁢ field. ‍We look forward‌ to seeing what you accomplish next.\nDr. carter: Thank‍ you. It’s been ‌a pleasure.",
