  "text": "Reflective clothing that makes people stand out to human drivers may make them invisible to automated crash prevention systems.\nWhile much of the crash avoidance technology is getting better at identifying and stopping for pedestrians at night – the time period when most fatal pedestrian crashes occur – some systems need to be improved to avoid being confused by clothing meant to help enhance visibility to keep pedestrians safe.\nThose are the main findings of a new study released on Thursday by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , a nonprofit financed by the insurance industry.\n“These results suggest that some automakers need to tweak their pedestrian automatic emergency braking systems,” David Harkey, the Insurance Institute’s president, said in a statement. “It’s untenable that the clothes that pedestrians, cyclists and roadway workers wear to be safe may make them harder for crash avoidance technology to recognize.”\nResearchers for “ A case study of nighttime pedestrian automatic emergency braking performance under different roadway lighting and pedestrian clothing conditions ,” evaluated the effects of high-visibility clothing and increased roadway lighting on the performance of the pedestrian automatic emergency braking (AEB) systems installed in three 2023 SUV models — a Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5 and Subaru Forester.\nThe pedestrian crash prevention research tests were conducted with dummies wearing four different outfits: all white, all black, a highly reflective jacket, and black clothing with reflective strips like attire worn by roadway workers. Each clothing type was assessed in various nighttime lighting conditions.\nMORE FROM FORBES VETTED REI Promo Codes: Save Up To 50% On Vuori, The North Face And More By Jordan Thomas The 4 Best Espresso Machines To Make Café-Quality Drinks At Home By Amanda Arnold The Subaru Forester came to a complete stop without hitting the pedestrian dummy and avoided a collision completely in all but one trial, according to the researchers. It impacted the dummy wearing clothing with reflective strips on the roadway test in one lighting condition. “Even in that run, it slowed by more than 80%,” the study noted.\nThe Honda CR-V and Mazda CX-5 hit the dummy in most of the test runs, but neither vehicle slowed at all when the dummy was wearing clothing with reflective strips that highlighted its limbs.\nOverall, the performance of the two vehicles was mixed in the other scenarios, the safety group said.\n“The placement and motion of reflective strips on the joints and limbs of pants and jackets allows drivers to quickly recognize the pattern of movement as a person,” David Kidd, a senior research scientist at the Insurance Institute and the study’s author, said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the moving strips didn’t have the same effect for the pedestrian AEB systems we tested and probably confounded their sensors.”\nIt was not clear why the Honda and Mazda systems “struggled with the reflective strips or how many other systems might have trouble identifying pedestrians wearing this type of clothing,” researchers for the study noted, adding that the lapse is a concern, considering how many roadway and emergency workers use similar garments on the job to mitigate risk.\n“This is a worrisome blind spot,” Harkey added.\nFurther research is needed, the safety group said.\nFor more information and specific results for each of the test vehicles, click here and here .",
