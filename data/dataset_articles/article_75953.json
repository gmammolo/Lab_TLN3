  "text": "(CNN) — With reports of the first human death from bird flu in the US, some Americans are feeling an uncomfortable flashback to the early days of Covid-19, when infectious disease experts were talking about a new virus that was sending people to the hospital with respiratory infections. Although both viruses can cause breathing problems, they are very different.\nCovid was spreading easily from person to person when it arrived in the US in 2020, but bird flu has been lurking for years, mostly as a problem for animals. Scientists also know a lot more about H5N1 bird flu than they did the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the US has been preparing for the threat of a new flu outbreak for a long time.\nStill, the virus is making moves that deserve attention. Here’s what you need to know about H5N1.\nWhat is bird flu? Avian influenza, or bird flu, is a broad term that refers to several types of influenza that normally infect birds. The bird flu that’s been making news in the United States is a virus called H5N1.\nSome flu viruses carried by birds cause only mild infections and are classified as low-pathogenic viruses. In contrast, H5N1 often kills birds that catch it, so it is classified as a highly pathogenic avian influenza.\nTo complicate matters, although bird flu viruses primarily prey on birds, they can also spread to other animals, including humans. Human infections with bird flu viruses are rare, and they’re usually what scientists call dead-end infections because they don’t typically transmit from person to person.\nIs H5N1 a new virus? You may have heard of H5N1 only recently, but it’s not a new virus. Scientists have been tracking it for almost three decades.\nIt was first identified in geese in Southern China in 1996. Over the years, it has caused sporadic outbreaks in wild and farmed birds around the globe.\nThe virus reappeared in North America in late 2021, and it quickly caught scientists’ attention because it seemed to have broadened its repertoire, spreading beyond birds and infecting a growing variety of mammals. In the current wave of infections, it has spread to more than 48 species in at least 26 countries .\nIt has caused mass die-offs of marine mammals too, including 24,000 sea lions that died in South America in 2023. In February 2024, Dr. Jeremy Farrar, who is chief scientist at the World Health Organization, called the ongoing spread of H5N1 “a pandemic of animals.”\nSince 2022, more than 130 million wild and farmed birds have been affected in America across all 50 states, 919 dairy herds have tested positive in 16 states, and 66 people have tested positive in 10 states, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Agriculture.\nCould H5N1 become a new pandemic? Scientists agree that the virus would need to evolve – or retain key changes in its genetic sequence – to start a pandemic.\nEach time a virus infects a cell and copies itself, it makes mistakes. Usually, these mistakes are benign or even harmful for the virus, but occasionally, there’s a genetic change that helps the virus become better at infecting cells. Given the right set of circumstances, that version of the virus may outcompete others and continue to survive, going on to infect new hosts or new kinds of hosts.\nFlu viruses can change in another way, too\nEach virus has eight segments, and like kids in a lunch room, they are always looking to swap. When two viruses trade whole segments, it’s called a reassortment, and it result in quick and sometimes dramatic changes to a virus’ abilities.\nScientists say either type of change could spell trouble for humans. Although the H5N1 virus is very good at infecting birds and has become a threat for many different kinds of mammals, including dairy cows, it’s still pretty clumsy at infecting people.\nIn cows, for example, the H5N1 virus primarily infects the mammary glands. This causes a dramatic drop in milk production but usually doesn’t kill the cow. In people, the main route of infection seems to be through the eyes; conjunctivitis, or red, inflamed eyes, seems to be the telltale symptom of infection.\nScientists think H5N1 infects the eyes because flu viruses enter cells through sugars on their surface called sialic acids. Birds – and human eyes – primarily have alpha 2,3 sialic acid receptors on their cells. But a different kind of sialic acid receptor, alpha 2,6, is more prevalent in the human respiratory tract. Human flu viruses, including those that cause seasonal influenza, have evolved to infect cells through alpha 2,6 receptors.\nGiven enough time in the human body, the bird flu virus has shown the ability to change to become better at infecting different kinds of cells and tissues, spreading from the eyes to the respiratory tract, for example.\nResearchers detected key changes to the genome of the virus in teenager in Canada who became severely ill with H5N1 in November. Those changes probably helped it infect cells in her respiratory tract. Samples of the H5N1 virus that infected a severely ill patient in Louisiana also showed signs of adaptation to human cells. Infectious disease experts warn that as the virus continues to spread, it’s more likely that it changes to become a fully human pathogen.\nHow are people catching bird flu? When humans have become infected, it’s almost always through contact with infected animals. Nearly all of these so-called spillover infections have been mild. And no one who has gotten H5N1 in the US is known to have given the infection to anyone else.\nHow do we know it’s not spreading from person to person? Success!
