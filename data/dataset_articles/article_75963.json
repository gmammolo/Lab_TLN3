  "text": "'Unless we do something, we are in imminent danger of making a whole part of our Earth environment unusable,' one physicist warned during a meeting of experts in DC this month. Just before Christmas, a US Air Force weather satellite shattered into 50 pieces: one of about four recent 'fragmentation' events in orbit that have experts raising the alarm about 'Kessler Syndrome.'\nNamed after American astrophysicist Donald Kessler — who first warned of its risks in 1978 — Kessler Syndrome basically describes a 'space junk' chain reaction, in which hardware smashing into each other in orbit creates runaway destruction.\nBits of broken satellites, the remains of booster rockets, wreckage from weapons tests and even objects as simple as a loose screw off a space capsule all contribute to the over 130 million estimated pieces of space junk now orbiting Earth.\nOnly about 40,500 pieces of that debris are greater than four inches, according to the European Space Agency (ESA). The vast majority is between 0.4 to 0.04 inches long.\nBut most of this 'space junk' is moving extremely fast, buzzing Earth at around 18,000 mph or nearly seven times faster than a speeding bullet, according to NASA.\nWhile only 650 major collision accidents have been reported since 1957, 'the number of objects in space that we have launched in the last four years has increased exponentially,' according to planetary scientist Vishnu Reddy.\n'We are heading towards the situation that we are always dreading,' Reddy warned.\n'Unless we do something, we are in imminent danger of making a whole part of our Earth environment unusable,' Dan Baker, the director of the University of Colorado's Atmospheric and Space Physics lab, warned during a conference this December.\nNamed after astrophysicist Donald Kessler - who first warned of its risks in 1978 - Kessler Syndrome basically describes a 'space junk' chain reaction, in which hardware smashing into each other in orbit creates runaway destruction. Above: a NASA map of known space junk\nLeoLabs estimated that a December 19, 2024 'fragmentation' of a US Air Force weather satellite introduced 50 new pieces of space junk into orbit.…\nMatthew Phelan Senior",
