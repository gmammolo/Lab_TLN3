  "text": "Reported By : S Aadeetya News18.com Last Updated: January 10, 2025, 07:30 IST Apple is clearing the doubts about the privacy of its users who use Siri for their daily tasks and explain how they always keep your data secure.\nreset\nFollow us on Google News Siri is allegedly spying on users but Apple explains why that will never happen Apple is clearly bothered by the recent news about Siri being allegedly used to spy on users and even record their conversations. There is even a lawsuit for which the company is liable to pay a hefty fine of over Rs 800 crores.\nBut Apple is now reaching out to its users and others and telling them about its privacy focus with Siri and how it will never use any of its products to spy on you and then sell that data to the advertisers.\nrelated stories “Apple has never used Siri data to build marketing profiles, never made it available for advertising, and never sold it to anyone for any purpose. We are constantly developing technologies to make Siri even more private, and will continue to do so,\" the company assured in a detailed post this week.\nSiri Is All About Privacy\nApple has even jotted down clear pointers that look to convince people that their privacy is not at risk if they keep Siri enabled on their devices. The company says it has designed Siri in such a way that most of the data processing is done on the device, which means your data never has to be sent to a server for further analysis. Apple even claims to be doing that for its AI features, as long as they are not using ChatGPT or Gemini tools on their iPhones.\nIt even points out the audio of user requests are processed on the device using its Neural engine as long as the person doesn’t give the consent to share it with Apple.\nData Kept Secure, Mostly\nApple does admit that in cases where some features need real-time input, the queries have to be sent to the Apple server for further processing. However, the company says it uses as little data as possible, and makes sure they cannot associate the data to the user without any Apple ID linked to the process.\nThe AI Siri Era\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video\nView all And yes, Apple does highlight its work towards a private cloud compute system that will be in effect across its AI features which includes the new Siri avatar.\nIt is interesting to hear the company talk about its privacy quite frequently and the timing of this post along with the news of the lawsuit verdict is there to help people make their mind on their brand and its focus on their privacy.\ntags : apple siri user privacy First Published: January 10, 2025, 07:30 IST News tech iPhone Users Being Spied And Tracked By Siri?
