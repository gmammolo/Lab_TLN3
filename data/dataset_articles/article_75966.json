Plus, why cash apps aren’t safe, Roblox’s kid safety problems, and flip phones making a comeback.\nCONTEST: Win a pair of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses! – ENTER TO WIN! No purchase necessary →\nHackers got into ADT’s systems, stealing customer info, and they waited months to tell anyone. Plus, why cash apps aren’t safe, Roblox’s kid safety problems, and flip phones making a comeback.\nLights, camera, AI: Johnny Depp says scammers are using AI to fake his voice and attempting to steal cash and personal info. He told his Instagram followers he’s not on X, Snapchat or Discord, so anyone claiming to be him is a fake. Reba McEntire and Kelly Rowland are targets, too. If your idol wants your money, it’s a scam.\nOn Zuck’s wrist when he announced Meta went MAGA and put an end to fact-checking. He was wearing the Greubel Forsey Hand Made 1; only a few are made each year. His collection includes a $90,000 De Bethune, a $141,000 Patek Philippe and a $12 Seiko. Next week, I’ll wear my favorite watch on my podcasts and show it to the camera. Spoiler: It’s a Rolex a big daily TV host wears, too.\nWipe your mouth! There’s a tiny amount of BS on your lips: The FCC approved a “U.S. Cyber Trust Mark” label for smart devices that meet their cybersecurity standards. No word on criteria yet, but expect rules around data privacy, regular updates and issue detection. Most internet-connected devices qualify … but not computers and phones, which we all use all the time.\nLength of Amazon memos. Keeping it short speeds up decisions. AI robotics startup Swiss-Mile followed suit when they pitched to Jeff Bezos in April. He gave them $22 million for testing delivery bots in Zurich. Less is more.\nGravy train derailed: Hackers breached data broker Gravy Analytics and got their hands on the location info of millions of people. They also named companies who bought their data, like Uber, Comcast, Apple and Equifax. Last month, the FTC went after Gravy for selling sensitive location data. This is why I use Incogni. They remove you from databases like this.\nThe apple of my lie: Apple Intelligence is messing up news summaries. Phony notifications include tennis star Rafael Nadal coming out as gay and Israel’s Prime Minister being arrested. The BBC says it’s hurting the credibility of news outlets. Always read past the headlines!\n🚘 Someone’s always watching: Some 150 automated license plate recognition cameras in a dozen cities leaked real-time video to anyone with internet access. Only law enforcement was supposed to see them. Motorola makes most of the cameras and says it’s now rolling out firmware updates to fix this mess. Too little, too late.\nThis is so very sad: Open AI CEO Sam Altman’s sister, Ann, filed a lawsuit saying he sexually abused her during their childhood. This allegedly started when she was just three years old, lasting from 1997 to 2006. Sam and his family say Ann suffers from mental health issues and she’s made untrue claims before. Here’s Sam’s full statement on X.\n🎮 Doesn’t he have enough to do? My son, Ian, showed me videos of Elon Musk playing video games online, and I found it hard to believe. As it turns out, Musk is one of the world’s top 20 players in Diablo IV … maybe. He bragged about clearing a tough level in under two minutes, a feat that takes days. Musk says he multitasks on business calls, but other players say there’s no way he climbed the leaderboard as fast as he did unless he’s playing day and night.\nLas Vegas bombing: Matthew Livelsberger, the soldier who blew up a Tesla Cybertruck outside of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, used ChatGPT to build the bomb and coordinate the explosion. OpenAI says they’re “saddened” and that their tool only shared public info and warned him about harmful and illegal activities. This is the first known case of ChatGPT being used for terrorism. It’s not going to be the last.",
