The company, which is part of Tesla’s supply chain, is now⁢ navigating a challenging landscape marked by inventory adjustments, rising costs, and‌ delayed demand​ recovery. However,analysts suggest that a rebound could be on the ​horizon,driven by ⁣strategic partnerships and market dynamics.\nA Tough Quarter for LG Energy Solution In the fourth quarter of 2023,⁢ LG Energy Solution recorded sales of KRW 6.4512 trillion , a 19.4%⁣ decline compared to the same period in 2022.The company also‍ reported an operating loss of KRW ⁤225.5 billion , significantly higher than the consensus estimate ‍of KRW 187 billion.\nJoo Min-woo, a researcher at NH Investment⁢ & Securities, attributed the poor performance to ⁣ one-time costs related to inventory ⁣disposal and the burden of fixed costs due‍ to sluggish sales.“The operating profit ratio ​excluding one-time ⁣costs is estimated at 1.2%,” he noted. ⁤\nthe⁣ sluggish sales were further exacerbated by inventory ⁣adjustments by customers in Europe and North America. Junsu Kwon, a researcher at⁣ Kiwoom ⁢Securities, explained, “Sales of⁣ mid- to large-sized batteries fell short of expectations due ⁣to year-end inventory adjustments in Europe and North America.” He also pointed to delays in the energy storage system (ESS) sector and the negative impact of ⁢rising metal prices as contributing factors. ⁤\nChallenges ​Ahead in 2024 The outlook for 2024 remains uncertain. Cho Hyun-ryeol, a researcher at Samsung Securities, maintained a neutral investment opinion on LG Energy Solution, citing “difficult industry conditions” due to policy changes in⁤ the⁢ United States and delayed⁤ global demand recovery in the frist half of the year.\nSamsung Securities also lowered its target stock price for LG Energy solution from KRW 430,000 to⁢ KRW 410,000 , ‌reflecting a shift in valuation ⁢metrics. Researcher Cho explained, ‌“Since the U.S. plants jointly operated with Stellantis, Honda, and Hyundai Motor Group have begun operation, and the performance of the joint‌ ventures affects the performance⁤ of ‌LG Energy Solutions, pure fundamentals can be steadfast through the net profit of controlling shareholders.”\nA Silver Lining: ​Tesla Partnership Despite the challenges, LG Energy Solution’s partnership with Tesla offers a ​glimmer⁣ of hope. The company is expected to benefit from the launch of Tesla’s Model Y Juniper , a partially modified (facelift) model. ‌Joo Min-woo highlighted this as a key factor that could drive stock price fluctuations in the ‌first half of 2024. ‌\n“We recommend purchasing if this year’s performance estimates are adjusted after the performance briefing,” he said. ⁢“Given the strong pre-orders for Model Y Juniper, ​the Trump administration’s strengthening of China’s CATL regulations, and the short-term ‌rebound in lithium prices, LG energy Solution’s ⁣stock‌ price could rise.” ‌\nPotential Recovery in the Second Half of 2024 Analysts suggest that a rebound in the battery sector ⁢could ⁤begin in the second half of 2024. Junsu Kwon ‍of Kiwoom Securities noted, “A full-fledged recovery in the industry will only⁤ be ‍possible next year, but​ considering the ‌lead in stock prices, the secondary battery sector will likely rebound starting⁣ in the second half of ⁢this year.”\nKey Takeaways | Metric ⁢ ‍ ⁢ | Q4 2023 performance ⁤ | 2024 Outlook ​ | ‌\n|————————–|——————————-|————————————–|\n| Sales ‍ ‍ ⁣ | KRW 6.4512 trillion ‌(-19.4%) | Challenging due to policy changes |\n| Operating Loss | ​KRW ‍225.5⁣ billion ⁣ ‌ ‌ ​ ⁣ ⁢ ​ | Potential recovery in H2 2024 ⁤ ⁢ |\n| Key Factors‌ ​ ⁣ | Inventory adjustments, rising costs | Tesla partnership, Model Y Juniper |\n| Analyst Recommendations | Neutral (Samsung Securities) | Buy (NH Investment & Securities) ⁤ ‍|\nLooking Ahead While LG Energy Solution faces significant headwinds, its strategic partnerships and market positioning could pave the way for recovery.

In this ​interview, we sit down with⁣ Dr. Seo Ji-hoon, a battery⁣ industry expert, to⁣ discuss LG Energy Solution’s performance, challenges, and ⁤future prospects.\nA Tough Quarter ⁤for LG Energy ⁢Solution Senior Editor: Dr. Seo,⁤ LG Energy Solution reported a 19.4% decline in sales and an operating loss of KRW 225.5 billion in⁣ Q4 2023.⁢ What factors contributed ⁢to this performance?\nDr. Seo Ji-hoon: The poor performance can be attributed to several factors. ‌First,​ there were significant⁣ one-time‍ costs related to inventory disposal, which weighed heavily on ‌the company’s financials. Additionally, sluggish sales, ⁢particularly in Europe and North America, exacerbated the situation.Customers in these regions‌ were adjusting their inventories, leading to lower-than-expected ⁣sales of mid- to ⁣large-sized batteries.

How ⁣significant⁤ is this collaboration?\nDr.seo Ji-hoon: The Tesla partnership is indeed a silver lining. LG Energy Solution is expected to benefit from the launch of Tesla’s Model Y Juniper, a partially modified model that has garnered strong pre-orders. this could drive stock price fluctuations in the first half of 2024. Additionally, the trump administration’s ‌tightening of regulations on⁣ China’s ⁣CATL and a short-term rebound⁢ in lithium prices could ⁣further boost⁣ LG Energy Solution’s stock. Analysts ⁢reccommend purchasing the stock if​ performance⁢ estimates are adjusted favorably after the company’s briefing.\nPotential⁣ Recovery in the Second Half of 2024 Senior Editor: Do you see a recovery on the ‌horizon for LG ​Energy Solution?\nDr. Seo Ji-hoon: Analysts suggest that a​ rebound in the battery ⁣sector ‍could begin in the second half of 2024. While‍ a full-fledged recovery may take longer, the secondary battery sector is ⁢likely to⁤ see‌ a rebound ‍starting in the latter half ‍of the year. This is⁤ driven by improved market conditions, strategic ‌partnerships, ‌and the anticipated recovery in lithium prices. Though,the company must navigate the current challenges carefully ⁢to capitalize on these opportunities.\nKey Takeaways Metric Q4 2023 Performance 2024 Outlook Sales KRW 6.4512 trillion (-19.4%) challenging due to ‍policy changes Operating​ Loss KRW 225.5 ‍billion Potential recovery in H2 2024 Key Factors Inventory adjustments, rising costs Tesla partnership, Model Y juniper Analyst ​Recommendations Neutral (Samsung⁤ Securities) Buy (NH Investment & Securities) Looking Ahead Senior Editor: What are your final thoughts on LG Energy Solution’s future?\nDr. Seo Ji-hoon: While LG Energy Solution faces‍ significant headwinds, its strategic partnerships, particularly‍ with Tesla,‍ and its market positioning offer reasons for ⁤cautious optimism.
