  "text": "Chrysler Airflow Concept Three years ago at CES 2022, Chrysler showed off a concept of a production-ready-looking mid-sized electric SUV called the Airflow. This vehicle was to be based on the variant of the upcoming STLA large platform underpinning the new Dodge Charger Daytona . A few months later in April, Chrysler showed off another version of the concept called the Airflow Graphite Concept .\n2022 Chrysler Airflow Concept BEV. (Chrysler). While not a super futuristic, outlandish design, the Airflow was a very handsome concept and looked to be production ready both interior, and exterior wise as soon as Stellantis had their STLA Large platform ready to go.\nBack To The Drawing Board A little over a year later, in an interview with MotorTrend , Ralph Gilles mentioned that they were going back to the drawing board on the Airflow concept.\n“She wanted a statement that had literally zero to do with anything that you have seen today, even the Airflow concept car. It is evolving in a new direction.”\n-Ralph Gilles in an interview to MotorTrend talking about Chrysler CEO Chris Fuell\nThe project for Chryslers Midsized electric SUV has been under development under the C6X (CA) codename. Where as C6X stands for the Variant of STLA large platform the vehicle was to be on, while CA would likely stand for Chrysler Airflow. This vehicle was scheduled to be built alongside the Chrysler Pacifica and Dodge Charger Daytona and Sixpack models at the Windsor Assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario Canada.\nProject Suspended Email Sent To Suppliers Regarding the Chrysler C6X program Well, unfortunately for fans of the Chrysler brand that have been waiting and hoping to see a production version of the Chrysler Airflow, things aren’t looking good. A source close to MoparInsiders just sent a screen shot of the email above which states:\nDear Supplier,\nThe C6X (CA) program has been put on hold until further notice. Therefore, any spending associated with this program should be suspended immediately.\n2022 Chrysler Airflow Concept BEV. (Chrysler). While suspended doesn’t mean cancelled, it is not good news for fans of the Chrysler brand who have been waiting for new product. We currently do not have any other information to share, but will keep on top of the story as it develops.",
