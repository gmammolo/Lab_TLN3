  "text": "Coinbase has reportedly received a subpoena from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as part of its investigation into the crypto prediction market platform Polymarket.\nThe subpoena was disclosed in a customer notice dated January 8 and shared on X by EthHub co-founder Eric Conner. It seeks general customer information, including details related to specific user accounts.\nThe notice informed customers that Coinbase “may be required” to provide user account data to the CFTC unless legally prevented by a motion to quash or another filing submitted by January 15, 2025. Coinbase clarified that no immediate action was required from users.\nThis development follows heightened scrutiny of Polymarket, which operates a decentralized prediction market platform. In November 2024, the FBI raided the home of Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan amid concerns around the platform’s compliance with regulatory standards.\nThe raid came shortly after Republican Donald Trump’s November 5 presidential election victory, which reportedly resulted in millions of dollars in winnings for cryptocurrency investors betting on his success through Polymarket. At the time, a Polymarket spokesperson labeled it as “political retribution” by the Biden administration for hosting a platform that allegedly “correctly called” the recent U.S. presidential election in favor of Donald Trump.\nInternational regulators have also taken an interest in Polymarket’s operations. France’s gaming authority launched an investigation in November 2024 to assess the platform’s compliance with gambling laws.\nPolymarket processed $3.7 billion in bets on its “Presidential Election Winner 2024” market, drawing criticism over its influence on the election narrative. Although U.S. residents are officially prohibited from placing bets on the platform, some have reportedly used VPNs to bypass restrictions. Ahead of the election, Polymarket was verifying that major bettors were overseas-based, as U.S. law restricts such activities.\nIn early 2022, Polymarket settled a $1.4 million fine with the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for offering unregistered event-based binary options. The FBI has yet to make any formal arrests or charges, while Coplan and Polymarket await further developments.\nPolymarket’s election odds, which have increasingly favored former President Donald Trump since early October, are consistent with those on other platforms, the company said. The sharp rise in Trump’s odds followed months of close competition with Vice President Kamala Harris , who maintained a lead earlier in the year.",
