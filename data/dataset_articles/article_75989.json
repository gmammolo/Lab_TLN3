  "text": "CHEYENNE – Early Tuesday morning, the Laramie County Library System was the victim of a ransomware attack that shut down library servers and immobilized most digital services.\nThe library’s Information Technology team was able to revert the system to a previous state and resume full service for library patrons by 9 a.m. The library’s IT team is confident that the purpose of the attack was to disrupt service as a way of extorting money, in the form of Bitcoin, from the library system, rather than targeting sensitive information, according to a Thursday news release.",
