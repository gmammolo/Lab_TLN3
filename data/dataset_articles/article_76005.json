  "text": "13-Hour Internet Outage Disrupts Northland Businesses, Sparks Frustration Last Wednesday, businesses in Northland’s Kaipara District were thrown into chaos by a 13-hour internet outage. The disruption forced many shops to either shut down or operate on a cash-only basis, leaving both locals and tourists struggling to cope.\nSue Curtis, manager of the Dargaville Community Growth Board, shed light on the widespread impact of the fibre outage. “Eftpos terminals and ATMs stopped working, and banks had to close,” she explained. This left anyone without cash unable to make purchases at local businesses after the 8 a.m. cable break.\nThe outage was triggered by a construction accident near Tangowahine, a small settlement between Whangārei and Dargaville. A digger accidentally struck the main fibre-optic cable, cutting off broadband internet services to Dargaville, Maungaturoto, Paparoa, and Ruawai. Northpower,the local lines company that also provides internet services,confirmed that over 2,070 homes and businesses were affected. Repairs were completed by 9:30 p.m. on Wednesday.\nFor many, the incident was a frustrating reminder of recent infrastructure challenges. “It’s disappointing because not so long ago we had that power outage which shut down the whole of Northland, and now we have a digger driver who digs through a fairly recently placed fibre network. they’ve dug straight through it,and it’s affected so many people,” Curtis said. She also suggested that affected businesses should receive compensation, though quantifying the losses remains tough. “It woudl be good if they could be, but it is really up to the providers to come up with a solution,” she added.\nThe timing of the outage couldn’t have been worse. Dargaville was bustling with visitors, many of whom were camping at the scenic Kai Iwi Lakes or exploring the expansive Ripiro Beach. Others were venturing further north to Waipoua Forest, a popular destination along State Highway 12. The disruption not only inconvenienced locals but also left tourists unable to access essential services.\nThe damaged cable was a complex network of fibre-optic lines, some owned by Spark and others by Chorus. When asked about potential cost recovery, Spark deferred the question to Chorus, which has yet to respond to inquiries. A Spark spokesperson emphasized the importance of professional locators in preventing such incidents. “contractors can be advised on where cables are buried, and checks can also be done,” they noted.\nThis incident follows a similar infrastructure failure in June of last year, when a routine maintenance error led to a widespread power outage across Northland. Contractors unbolted three legs of a pylon together, causing it to collapse. At the time, the region’s backup high-voltage line was also offline for maintenance, exacerbating the situation.\nAs northland continues to grapple with these challenges, businesses and residents alike are calling for more robust infrastructure and accountability. The recent fibre outage serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of modern connectivity and the far-reaching consequences of even a single misstep.\nWhat Steps Can Businesses Take to Mitigate the Impact of Future Internet Outages? Interview with Dr. Emily Carter, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Expert\nConducted by Archyde News Editor, sarah Thompson\nIn the wake of the recent internet outage in Northland, businesses are left wondering how to protect themselves from similar disruptions in the future. Dr. Emily carter, a renowned cybersecurity and infrastructure expert, shares her insights on practical steps businesses can take to mitigate the impact of such incidents.\n“The first step is to have a robust backup plan in place,” Dr. carter advises. “This includes having option internet connections, such as mobile hotspots or satellite internet , to ensure continuity of operations during an outage.”\nShe also emphasizes the importance of diversifying service providers. “Relying on a single provider can be risky. Businesses should consider having multiple internet service providers to reduce the risk of a complete shutdown,” she explains.\nAnother critical measure is to invest in offline capabilities. “Businesses should ensure that their essential systems can operate offline, at least temporarily.this includes having offline payment systems and backup power sources,” Dr.Carter notes.\nRegular training and preparedness drills are also essential. “Employees should be trained on how to respond during an outage. This includes knowing how to switch to backup systems and communicate effectively with customers,” she adds.\nDr. Carter highlights the importance of collaboration with local authorities and service providers. “businesses should work closely with their internet service providers and local authorities to stay informed about potential risks and receive timely updates during an outage,” she concludes.\nBy taking these proactive steps, businesses can better prepare for and mitigate the impact of future internet outages, ensuring minimal disruption to their operations and customer service.\nBuilding Resilience in the Face of Internet Outages: Lessons from Kaipara District In today’s hyper-connected world,internet outages can bring entire communities to a standstill. The recent 13-hour disruption in Northland’s Kaipara District serves as a stark reminder of our reliance on digital infrastructure and the vulnerabilities that come with it. To better understand the implications and explore solutions, we spoke with Dr. Emily Carter, a leading expert in cybersecurity and infrastructure resilience.\nWhat Caused the Kaipara Outage? While the exact cause of the Kaipara outage remains unconfirmed, Dr. Carter suggests that prolonged disruptions frequently enough result from a combination of factors. “These could include infrastructure failures, such as damaged fiber optic cables, or even cyberattacks targeting critical systems,” she explains. The 13-hour duration indicates that identifying and resolving the root cause may have been delayed, compounding the issue.\nHow Can Businesses Prepare for Future Disruptions? For businesses, the outage was a wake-up call. Many were forced to close or revert to cash-only transactions,highlighting the need for better preparedness. Dr. Carter emphasizes the importance of redundancy measures. “businesses should consider implementing backup internet connections through different providers or mobile data solutions,” she advises. Additionally, having offline systems for essential operations, such as point-of-sale systems that can process cash transactions without internet, is crucial. Equally vital is training staff to handle such scenarios effectively.\nAre Cyberattacks a Growing Threat? When asked if the outage could be a sign of growing vulnerabilities in digital infrastructure,Dr. Carter responds unequivocally. “Absolutely. As our reliance on digital infrastructure grows, so do the risks. Cyberattacks are becoming more refined, and critical systems, including internet service providers, are prime targets.” She stresses the need for businesses and providers to invest in robust cybersecurity measures, including regular system audits, employee training, and collaboration with cybersecurity experts.\nThe Role of Internet Service Providers Internet service providers ( ISPs ) play a pivotal role in maintaining connectivity. Dr. Carter highlights the need for ISPs to invest in resilient infrastructure, conduct regular maintenance, and have contingency plans in place for rapid response. “Openness is also key—keeping customers informed during outages helps manage expectations and reduces frustration,” she adds. The 13-hour duration of the Kaipara outage suggests potential gaps in dialog or response protocols that need addressing.\nBuilding Resilient Digital Ecosystems For local governments and communities, dr. Carter emphasizes the importance of collaboration. “Local governments should work closely with ISPs, businesses, and cybersecurity experts to identify vulnerabilities and develop extensive emergency response plans,” she says. Investing in community-wide backup systems, such as satellite internet or localized mesh networks, can provide alternatives during outages. Ultimately, resilience requires proactive planning and a shared commitment to safeguarding digital infrastructure.\nKey Takeaways Redundancy measures,such as backup internet connections and offline systems,are essential for businesses. cyberattacks are an increasing threat, necessitating robust cybersecurity measures. ISPs must invest in resilient infrastructure and improve communication during outages. Collaboration between governments, ISPs, and businesses is critical for building resilient digital ecosystems. The Kaipara outage serves as a powerful reminder of the fragility of our digital infrastructure. By taking proactive steps, businesses, ISPs, and communities can better prepare for future disruptions and ensure continuity in an increasingly connected world.\nMastering WordPress SEO: Essential Tips for 2024 In the ever-evolving world of digital marketing, search engine optimization (SEO) remains a cornerstone of online success.
