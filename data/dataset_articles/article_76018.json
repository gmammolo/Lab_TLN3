  "text": "No, There's No \"Age Of AI\" or \"Era Of AI\" or \"AI Revolution\" or \"AI Arms Race\", It's Just a Dying Tech Industry Looking to Prop Up Its Valuation Using Hype and False Marketing of Mostly Dysfunctional Tools\nPlease, enough with this nonsense based on theoretical \"use cases\" and sometimes intentional vapourware\nEarlier this week CSS-Tricks published something entitled \"The Importance Of Investing In Soft Skills In The Age Of AI\" (yes, hey hi!) and the latter part seems absurd. Cheaper coders (working for less money), not LLMs, is the real \"issue\". As for hey hi (AI), it can be seen as the catch-all excuse/scapegoat. It's always there in the a corporate propagandists' toolset. Here's a new example of this, in fact one wherein a Microsoft-friendly publisher uses \"hey hi\" (AI) to make a business failure of Microsoft - and now thousands of more layoffs - seem like \"innovation\" to be admired.\nThe title speaks of \"The Age Of AI\", but there is no \"AGE OF HEY HI\"... as ML (machine learning) is over 50 years old in some sense.\n\"Again,\" an associate argues, \"it's still about control. Whoever writes the code controls the computers and they can be controlled by turning them into wage slaves.\"\nWell, in theory we could write and execute our own code, but Microsoft and IBM try to mandate that only SOME code can be run (UEFI 'secure' boot was put inside Linux by Red Hat so as to put Microsoft in control). Therein is the real threat - computers that do not allow the user to run actually secure code, only backdoored garbage (in binary form) from GAFAM et al.\nJudging by new puff pieces like this one, Microsoft is now super-worried that shareholders might realise Azure has failed (the \"hey hi\" smokescreen aside) and possibly still loses money (if not market share, too). Azure is were a lot of those layoffs are happening and have been happening for 5 years already. Microsoft cooks the books to hide what's really happening. The buzzwords help, so bypass those.
