  "text": "So much of the technology showcased at CES includes gadgets made to improve consumers, but not all innovation is good. A panel of self-described dystopia experts has judged some products as ‘Worst in Show. Least repairable product Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, awarded the US$ 2,200 Ultrahuman Rare Luxury Smart Ring the title of least repairable. Its battery only lasts 500 charges and cant be replaced. Sharing too much Boschs ‘Revol crib uses sensors, cameras and AI that can help monitor how an infant is sleeping, heart and respiratory rates and more. The crib can also rock gently and signal if a blanket or other object is interfering with breathing. But EFF Executive Director Cindy Cohn said it collects excessive data about babies. Ultrahuman Rare Luxury Smart Ring Too much waste? Stacey Higginbotham, a policy Fellow at Consumer Reports, felt that SoundHound AIs In-Car Commerce Ecosystem increases energy consumption and distracts drivers. Vulnerable to hacks TP-Links Archer BE900 router won for least secure. Paul Roberts, founder of Security Ledger, said TP-Link showcased it without addressing issues. Who wanted this? Nathan Proctor, senior director of US PIRG, a consumer advocacy group, said Samsungs Bespoke AI Washing Machine is filled with features no one needs, making the appliance more expensive, fragile, and harder to repair. The worst overall Gay Gordon-Byrne, director of The Repair Association called the LG ‘AI Home Inside 2.0 Refrigerator with ThinkQ the worst product overall.",
