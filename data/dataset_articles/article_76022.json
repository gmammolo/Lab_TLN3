  "text": "I find myself after two months of pure fun reiterating the topic of input lag on PC. I have a nice configuration, with 3070 TI, 64 GB RAM and i7 12700K, but despite having 200fps, I find the gameplay very slow, as if in my controller there is 1ms of delay when it is not, I use a 144hz 1ms monitor, so I'm really tired of having to poison myself for each pass because 1ms is lost to do it, or wrong shots because the delay of the shot causes the ball to be deflected by the defender, or missed defenses because with too much delay the defender goes to the other side of the ball, help us please",
