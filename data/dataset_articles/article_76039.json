  "text": "Global Warming Milestone: 2024 Sees Historic Temperature Rise\nIn 2024, the world's average temperature exceeded 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, marking a significant milestone. The European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service highlighted this alarming trend, urging for immediate emission cuts. Extreme weather events across continents signal the escalating impacts of climate change.\n[Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 10-01-2025 08:32 IST | Created: 10-01-2025 08:32 IST\nFor the first time, global temperatures in 2024 consistently surpassed the critical 1.5°C threshold above pre-industrial levels, as confirmed by the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). This alarming rise signals an urgent call to action against climate change.\nThe C3S director, Carlo Buontempo, emphasized the extraordinary nature of this trend, highlighting that every month in 2024 marked record-breaking temperatures since record-keeping began. Despite this, there remains a window of opportunity for countries to curb emissions and reverse the trajectory.\nThe impacts are stark, with wildfires, floods, and catastrophic events more frequent worldwide. Yet, political will to combat climate change has diminished in some regions, risking exacerbation of the crisis. Scientists and experts stress the continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions as a critical concern.\n(With inputs from agencies.)",
