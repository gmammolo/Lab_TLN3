  "text": "The new [Tesla Model Y](/tesla/model-y) is due to arrive in Australia from May 2025, wearing a higher price tag but featuring a raft of cosmetic and mechanical enhancements.\n[Revealed earlier today](/car-news/2025-tesla-model-y-revealed-fresh-look-for-worlds-best-selling-ev), Tesla is first launching the Model Y with Launch Series enhancements, and only in RWD and Long Range AWD variants. A Performance model is expected to follow later.\nThe entry-level Model Y RWD starts from $63,400 before on-road costs (up $7500), while the Long Range AWD is up by $3500 to $73,400 before on-roads.\n100s of new car deals are available through CarExpert right now. Get the experts on your side and score a great deal. [Browse now](/new-car-deals/).\nBoth variants have greater driving range, expected to be due in part to the sleeker [Cybertruck](/tesla/cybertruck/)-inspired front end which incorporates a full-width LED light bar. Down back, there’s another full-width light bar.\nTesla says the suspension has been retuned for greater comfort and “smooth handling”, while there’s more responsive steering.\nThere’s an updated wheel and tyre package which is also said to help offer a smoother driving experience as well as greater grip. Only 20-inch alloy wheels are available, at least for now.\nRedesigned body castings have also reduced the number of parts, another change said to help reduce road noise.\nIn the cabin there are new ventilated front seats, while rear occupants get a 8.0-inch touchscreen and power-reclining seats.\nPricing\nModel | Price before on-road costs |\n---|---|\n2025 Tesla Model Y RWD Launch Series | $63,400 (up $7500 on pre-facelift) |\n2025 Tesla Model Y Long Range AWD Launch Series | $73,400 (up $3500 on pre-facelift) |\nDrivetrains and Efficiency\nTesla doesn’t openly quote power and torque figures like most brands, although it does offer 0-100km/h sprint times.\nTesla Model Y RWD | Tesla Model Y Long Range AWD | |\n---|---|---|\nPower | TBC | TBC |\nTorque | TBC | TBC |\n0-100km/h (claimed) | 5.9 seconds (down 1.0 second) | 4.3 seconds (down 0.7 seconds) |\nClaimed range (WLTP, estimated) | 466km (up 11km) | 551km (up 18km) |\nDimensions\nTesla is yet to detail the updated Model Y’s measurements.\nBelow are the figures from the pre-facelift Model Y, which are largely expected to carry over.\n2024 Tesla Model Y* | |\n---|---|\nLength | 4751mm |\nWidth | 2129mm (1978mm with folded mirrors) |\nHeight | 1624mm |\nWeight | 1909kg (RWD), 1979kg (Long Range), 1997kg (Performance) |\nStorage space | 854L (rear seats up + frunk), 2158L (rear seats folded) |\nServicing and Warranty\nThe Tesla Model Y is covered by a four-year, 80,000km warranty in Australia.\nThe Model Y RWD’s battery is backed by an eight-year or 160,000km warranty, whichever comes first. The Model Y Long Range and Performance batteries are covered for eight years or 192,000km.\nDuring the warranty period, Tesla Australia guarantees the battery will retain a minimum of 70 per cent capacity.\nSafety\nThe pre-facelift Tesla Model Y received a five-star ANCAP safety rating in 2022, based on tests conducted by Euro NCAP. It’s not yet clear if this carries across to the updated model.\nIt scored 97 per cent for adult occupant protection, 89 per cent for child occupant protection, 82 per cent for vulnerable road user protection, and 98 per cent for safety assist.\nFeatures understood to carry over include:\n- Seven airbags incl. front-centre airbag\n- Autonomous emergency braking (AEB)\n- Forward, reverse\n- Car, pedestrian, cyclist detection\n- Junction assist\n- Blind-spot assist\n- Lane keep assist\n- Reverse and side view cameras\n- Front, rear parking sensors\n- Tyre pressure monitoring\n- Intelligent speed limiter\nStandard Equipment\nThe base Model Y RWD features:\n- 20-inch ‘Helix’ wheels (NEW)\n- Full-width LED front and rear lights (NEW)\n- Automatic high-beam\n- Acoustic glass\n- Power-folding, auto-dimming and heated side mirrors\n- Floor mats\n- Black leather upholstery\n- Black and white available for $1500\n- Power-adjustable front seats\n- Power-reclining rear seats (NEW)\n- 15.4-inch infotainment touchscreen (NEW)\n- Wireless smartphone charger\n- 8-inch rear touchscreen with climate, entertainment controls (NEW)\n- Panoramic glass roof\n- Dog Mode (maintains cabin temperature)\n- Launch Series-specific appearance\n- Boot badge\n- Puddle lighting\n- Doorsill plate\n- Charging console script\n- Vegan suede trim\nThe Long Range AWD adds:\n- ‘Invisible speakers’\n- Acceleration boost\nColours\nThere are five available colours for the Tesla Model Y:\n- Pearl White Multi-coat\n- Glacier Blue\n- Stealth Grey\n- Quicksilver\n- Ultra Red\nAll finishes are available at no extra cost.",
