  "text": "Many users now searching how to delete Facebook, Instagram as Meta scraps fact checking: Report\nMeta's decision to do away with third-party fact-checking has led to a significant backlash. According to a TechCrunch report, Google Trends highlights increased interest in deleting Facebook and Instagram.\nIn Short\n- Meta stops fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram from January 7, 2025\n- After this step, it has been reported that users are searching for alternatives\n- Meta plans community notes system to replace fact-checkers\nIn a move that has sparked considerable backlash, Meta has announced it will no longer be implementing its fact-checking measures on certain posts across its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, on January 7, 2025. This decision has led to a noticeable increase in the number of users contemplating or actively pursuing account deletions, as many feel the removal of these safeguards compromises the integrity of the information shared on Meta’s networks.\nFact-checking on social media platforms has been a vital tool in curbing the spread of false or misleading information, especially during critical events such as elections and public health crises. Meta’s initiative to integrate fact-checking was initially seen as a step toward restoring credibility in an environment often rife with viral hoaxes, fake news, and propaganda. However, with the discontinuation of these measures, the concern is that users may be exposed to an even greater volume of unreliable content.\nThe impact of Meta’s decision has already been felt in the form of increased discussions surrounding the safety and reliability of its platforms. Many users, especially those advocating for more transparency and accountability from social media giants, have voiced their discontent and begun exploring alternatives. Some have begun deleting their accounts or reducing their time spent on the platforms, citing concerns that Meta’s shift may allow harmful content to flourish unchecked.\nA report, published by TechCrunch, highlights how users are increasingly looking for social networks or platforms with stronger content moderation policies as a means to ensure a safer and more trustworthy online experience. The report states, “Google searches for terms like “how to permanently delete Facebook” hit a maximum score of 100 — the highest level of interest possible on Google Trends.”\nThe report adds that Google Trends data shows a sharp spike in searches like “how to delete all photos on Facebook,” “alternatives to Facebook,” “how to quit Facebook,” “how to delete a Threads account,” and “how to delete an Instagram account without logging in.” These terms have experienced an explosive increase in popularity, rising over 5,000 per cent compared to earlier periods.\nFurthermore, the timing of Meta’s move has raised concerns, particularly as misinformation remains a persistent issue, especially with political seasons and global events on the horizon. The loss of fact-checking is seen by critics as a major setback in the fight against the spread of false information online.\nMeta's decision to reduce fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram has led to heightened dissatisfaction among users who view the move as a step backward in ensuring the platforms remain a reliable source of information. As a defence, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg states that this decision is an attempt to restore free speech. Interestingly, when Elon Musk took over X (formerly Twitter), he stated something similar. The CEO of Meta mentioned that his platforms would replace third-party fact-checkers with a community notes system similar to X's, allowing users to flag posts they believe require additional context.\nAs alternative social media options gain traction, it remains to be seen whether Meta’s strategy will ultimately alienate its user base or simply redefine the role of fact-checking in the future of digital communication.",
