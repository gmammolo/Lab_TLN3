  "text": "An engineer who goes by \"STS 3D\" caught OpenAI's attention - and not in a good way. The developer built a rifle system that could be controlled through ChatGPT voice commands, [demonstrating in a viral video](https://www.instagram.com/p/DEd_7mTtf4D/) how the system could automatically aim and fire at targets using [OpenAI's Realtime API](https://the-decoder.com/openais-new-realtime-api-lets-developers-add-realistic-conversations-to-their-apps/). OpenAI quickly stepped in, [revoking the developer's API access](https://futurism.com/openai-powered-sentry-rifle) for violating their terms of service. [While OpenAI has its own military contracts](https://the-decoder.com/openai-leadership-defends-military-use-of-ai-against-internal-criticism/), the company has a strict policy against anyone [using tools like ChatGPT for weapons systems](https://the-decoder.com/openai-no-longer-explicitly-excludes-the-use-of-its-ai-systems-for-military-and-warfare/).\nAd",
