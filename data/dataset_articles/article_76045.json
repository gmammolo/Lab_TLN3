  "text": "Earth’s temperature remained 1.5°C above the pre-industrial average throughout all of last year, representing the first calendar-long breach of the milestone on record. Copernicus, European Union's climate change monitoring service, said the global temperature of 15.10°C was 0.12°C above 2023's temperature, the previous warmest year. It was also 1.60°C higher than the pre-fossil fuel era 1850-1900 temperature estimate. Scientists said the figures suggested it was now “very likely” the world fail to reach its 2060 global warming targets. Akshay Deoras, a research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading told<i> The National</i> that the milestone shows humanity is “treating our planet like a credit card with no limit”. “The annual global temperature crossing the 1.5°C mark for the first time in 2024 shows the bill is coming, which unfortunately could lead to a further increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events across the globe,” Mr Deoras said. To breach the Paris Agreement, the average global temperature over a period of at least 20 years must exceed the temperature recorded during the pre-industrial period, from 1850–1900, by at least 1.5°C, he said. “Whilst we are yet to breach the Paris Agreement, several consecutive months since summer 2023 have been warmer by at least 1.5°C, showing how serious the problem of global warming is. The more often 1.5°C threshold gets breached, the closer we would be to the breaching of the Paris Agreement,” he said. “We're already seeing homes become uninsurable and disasters costing billions. This isn't about future generations any more – it's about us, today. We are on track to see new warming records getting broken, unless we immediately cut down the emission of greenhouse gases,” added Mr Deoras. During the first half of the year, which was the world's hottest on record, each month registered higher readings than the same month in any previous year, leading to a 13-month streak of record-breaking temperatures. Global temperature remained significantly above average in the second half, which saw the world set a record daily global average temperature of 17.16°C on July 22. It was the warmest year for all continental regions, except Antarctica and Australasia, as well as for sizeable parts of the ocean, particularly the North Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the western Pacific Ocean. Around Antarctica, sea ice reached record or near-record low values during a large part of the year, while in the Arctic, the sea ice extent was relatively close to its 1991–2020 average until July, but fell well below average in the following months. At its annual minimum in September, levels were fifth lowest in the satellite record. Carlo Buontempo, Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service said he was “running out of metaphors” to explain the warming. “The many record breaking events that we have seen over the course of the last 12 months are not statistical oddities, but rather a direct consequence of the generalised warming of our climate system,” he said. “The underlying physics is very clear. A warmer global climate produces more frequent and intense events, such as for example, heatwaves. A warmer atmosphere also holds more moisture, leading to heavier rainfall, where warmer seas amplify the potential for destructive storms,” he added. The Paris Agreement’s long-term goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C was chosen to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, albeit with more common extreme heatwaves and droughts compared to today. Under this scenario, the world is expected to exceed 1.5°C from 2030 before dropping below 1.5°C by 2060. Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate at Copernicus, told a press conference on Thursday that 2024’s milestone means it is “very likely” the world will overshoot the target. “Given that we have had our first calendar year of 1.5ºC, there is an extremely high likelihood that we will overshoot the long-term average of 1.5ºC and the Paris Agreement limit. “However, my personal opinion is that this is an extraordinarily important policy that all countries around the world have committed to, so I don’t think it’s fair to say the Paris Agreement is dead. And I think if we do overshoot 1.5ºC, which has a high probability associated with it, the next target does not automatically deflect to 2ºC, but the next target becomes 1.51ºC. And the sooner we get to net zero emissions, the sooner we will stabilise our climate and reduce the potential impacts of future extreme events.” According to the Carbon Brief, if warming exceeds 1.5°C beyond 2100 and peaks at 1.89°C, sea-levels will rise by 20cm in more than 70 per cent of the Earth's coastlines. To achieve this, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by 9.2 per cent from current global levels. If warming continues to rise, peaking at 2.69°C by 2100, the world would pass a catastrophic point of no return, with the loss of all ice sheets, sea level rises of several metres, extreme heatwaves occurring most years and the drying out of the Amazon rainforest. Warming of 4°C would result in unprecedented heatwaves, severe drought and major flooding, creating millions of global climate refugees. Wide-scale adaptation to global sea rise would also be necessary.",
