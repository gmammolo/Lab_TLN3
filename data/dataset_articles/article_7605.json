  "text": "Several sustained minor injuries after four vehicles collided with each other on the highway near Chirmi Hotel in Jaipur’s Chomu on Wednesday. According to preliminary information, the accident was caused due to poor visibility from dense fog. A truck first rammed into an overloaded tractor-trolley carrying fodder. The impact pushed the tractor-trolley forward, hitting two cars ahead before finally crashing into a tree. Fortunately, all injured occupants were reported to have suffered only minor injuries. However, traffic was disrupted for some time following the accident. As the dense fog is reducing visibility, accident cases are increasing, and the authorities are urging commuters to practise caution. In another incident reported from Rajasthan’s Nagaur, three people were killed after a speeding Scorpio collided head-on with a private bus on National Highway 58 near the Surpalia bus stand in Nagaur district. Four others were severely injured and were rushed to the hospital. Dense Fog In Jaipur According to the IMD, Jaipur is experiencing a cold wave with temperatures dropping to 19 °C. Besides the cold wave affecting the city, the state capital also saw a decline in air quality. As per the CPCB, Jaipur recorded an AQI of 247 at 8 in the morning, classifying it as ‘Poor’. In addition to Jaipur, other cities in Rajasthan were enveloped in dense fog. Ajmer, too, was covered in thick fog this morning. Like Jaipur, Ajmer experienced a significant drop in visibility, with houses engulfed in fog. However, Ajmer’s air quality was relatively better, recording an AQI of 106, which falls in the ‘Moderate’ category.",
