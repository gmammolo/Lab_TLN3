  "text": "ISLAMABAD: The Cabinet Division has issued an advisory to federal ministries, divisions and departments against leakage and theft of sensitive data and information through Wi-Fi and wireless networks declaring wireless routers as less safer devices.\nThe advisory says that there can be easy disruption or interference through Wi-Fi in network traffic while traffic can be diverted to unsafe networks through router updates. It says that directors and files can be easily shared through Wi-Fi network. It has been suggested to keep passwords of Wi-Fi as complicated and keep both IDs and passwords as secret.\nIt has also been advised to shut guest network to avoid leakage of sensitive data and information.",
