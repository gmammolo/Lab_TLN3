  "text": "an hour ago\nMy Fujitsu AIRSTAGE mini split system has been connected to my wifi for several months. It works well through the dedicated iOS app. It has also responded very well on my Nest Hub to “Hey Google” and made both checking status (“show me the status”) and operating the units (“turn on the device for 30 minutes”) so convenient. The hub has suddenly stopped communicating with the system and now shows the message “Sorry I couldn’t reach the AIRSTAGE Smart Home”. Anyone have this problem and find a solution?",
