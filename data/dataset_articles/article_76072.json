  "text": "Tokyo stocks fell Friday morning, weighed down by the selling of Nikkei heavyweight Fast Retailing after the earnings results of the Uniqlo clothing chain operator showed a sluggish performance in China .\nThe 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 193.33 points, or 0.49 percent, from Thursday to 39,411.76. The broader Topix index was down 8.35 points, or 0.31 percent, at 2,727.57.\nThe U.S. dollar was almost flat in the lower 158 yen range in Tokyo as traders awaited U.S. employment data to be released later in the day, dealers said.\nAt noon, the dollar fetched 158.25-28 yen compared with 158.03-13 yen in New York and 158.18-20 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Thursday .\nThe euro was quoted at $1.0301-0303 and 163.01-08 yen against $1.0294-0304 and 162.83-93 yen in New York and $1.0290-0292 and 162.77-81 yen in Tokyo late Thursday afternoon.\nStocks were lower as Fast Retailing saw heavy selling after reporting its profits in China fell sharply in the September-November period, although its consolidated earnings saw record-high sales and net profit for the period.\nSome investors also sold Fast Retailing shares to lock in gains after their sharp climb recently amid expectations for upbeat earnings, brokers said. The retailer ended the morning down 6.5 percent at 48,700 yen .\n==Kyodo\n© Kyodo News International, Inc., source Newswire\nShare © Acquiremedia - 2025",
