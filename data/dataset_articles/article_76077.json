  "text": "by Ananya Gairola , Benzinga Staff Writer\nJanuary 9, 2025 10:49 PM | 2 min read | 1 Comment\nInternal documents from Meta Platforms, Inc. META reportedly indicate a policy designed to protect high-spending advertisers from automated content moderation.\nWhat Happened: The documents from 2023 reveal that Meta implemented “guardrails” to protect top advertisers, reported Financial Times.\nThese measures included suppressing automated detections based on advertising spend, with some accounts being reviewed manually instead.\nSee Also: Big Tech’s Date With Antitrust: Alphabet, Meta, Amazon Brace For Legal Showdowns In 2025\nA group termed “P95 spenders,” spending over $1,500 daily, were noted as exempt from standard advertising restrictions, the report noted.\nMeta’s spokesperson, Ryan Daniels , refuted the report, stating it was “simply inaccurate” and based on a selective interpretation of the documents.\nMeta acknowledged using “higher spend” as a guardrail due to the potential impact of mistakenly removing high-reach ads.\nThe company maintained that all advertisers are subject to the same standards, with no exemptions from its rules, the report stated.\nMeta did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comments.\nSubscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.\nWhy It Matters: Advertising is a significant revenue source for Meta, contributing nearly $135 billion in 2023.\nIn October 2024, Meta reported third-quarter revenue of $40.59 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of $40.29 billion. Ad impressions rose by 7% compared to the previous year, while the average price per ad increased by 11% year-over-year.\nThis revelation comes at a time when Meta is shifting its content moderation strategy . Earlier this week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a move towards a Community Notes style of moderation, similar to Elon Musk’s X .\nThis change follows a report that Meta’s platforms were promoting illegal gun silencers , despite policies against such ads.\nPrice Action: Meta’s stock fell by 1.16% on Thursday and dropped an additional 0.34% in after-hours trading, settling at $608.64. Despite the dip, the company’s shares have risen by 3.58% year-to-date, according to data from Benzinga Pro .\nImage via Shutterstock\nCheck out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link .\nRead Next: Dana White Wanted Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg In Cage Fight, Now He’s On Meta’s Board Of Directors\nRead Next:\nApple’s 2025 Bull Case: Can It Deliver Without Riding The AI Wave?
