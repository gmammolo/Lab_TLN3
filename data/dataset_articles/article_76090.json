  "text": "The Nintendo Switch 2 could sell over 4 million units in its first year in the US – but Sony's PS5 is still expected to perform better. Rumours point to an April launch (Nintendo)\nAlthough the Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to sell millions in the US alone, it's suggested it's first year won't be as strong as the original's.\nGiven how rabid anticipation is for the Nintendo Switch 2, it's unlikely the console will have any trouble selling at launch. In fact, Nintendo's apparently bolstering stock to prevent it from selling out, as well as mitigate the inevitable scalping issues.\nThat said, Nintendo would naturally want to see the Switch 2 outperform its older sibling. Obviously, it won't match the original console's lifetime sales overnight, but one analyst predicts it won't beat it at launch either.\nWhile there remains no word of an official reveal or release date from Nintendo, Matt Piscatella, executive director and industry analyst at Circana, has taken a crack at estimating the Switch 2's sales performance, at least in the US.\nIn a post on Bluesky, Piscatella predicts the Switch 2 will sell 4.3 million units in the US by the end of 2025. This is assuming the Switch 2 is released during the first half of this year.\nFor what it's worth, recent speculation and rumours point to Nintendo unveiling the console before…\nMichael Beckwith",
