  "text": "49m ago\nI bought my Google nest smart learning thermostat third GEN a couple months ago and everything has been fine until it started getting cold here in Florida. We started using the heat and I noticed when I woke up the last few mornings that it was very cold in the house The temperature was 67° but the thermostat was set to 72. It says it’s on and running and has a countdown until it reaches 10 but neverachieves temperature. I went outside and noticed that the outside unit is not coming on. If I turn the air conditioning on the outside unit kicks on and when I turn the heat on right after it kicked on after a delay yesterday, but now after trying the same thing again this morning when it did it again it’s not coming on at all now. It has to be the thermostat I can get the air conditioning to work but not the heat. I reversed the wires in the system to blow heat on the air conditioning and it seems to be working but now there’s no way to control the temperature. Anybody have any ideas on how to fix?",
