  "text": "CVE |\n|\n---|\nThe Orbit Fox by ThemeIsle plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Pricing Table widget in all versions up to, and including, 2.10.43 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.\nSoftware Type | Plugin |\n---|---|\nSoftware Slug |\nthemeisle-companion\n|\nThis record contains material that is subject to copyright.\nCopyright 2012-2025 Defiant Inc.\nLicense:\nDefiant hereby grants you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute this software vulnerability information.
