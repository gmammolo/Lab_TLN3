  "text": "Despite an overall positive reception, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has suffered from its fair share of bugs plaguing the experience. While some glitches are harmless, others can prove extremely frustrating, like the Black Ops 6 bug that basically forced players to cheat on Nuketown. For the most part, Treyarch has been good at listening to the community, identifying these bugs, and fixing them as quickly as possible. However, as this latest issue with Vermin shows, it doesn't always quite go to plan.\nRedditor HarambeVengeance shared footage from a Black Ops 6 Zombies match, taken after the game's large January 3 patch. The player is struck by a Vermin, and is clearly hit with two attacks, being taken down. In the game's most recent patch notes, Treyarch claimed to have \"addressed an issue where Vermin could sometimes hit twice with one attack.\" Whatever fix has been implemented doesn't seem to be working as intended, although it isn't clear if it's happening less frequently than it was before.\nTo further their case, the player also pointed out that the Vermin jump attack would usually do 67 damage, although they take 134 immediately. Black Ops 6 players already had complaints about Vermin rounds, but the continued existence of this bug will only serve to make that worse. Other players in the thread claimed to have had a similar experience post-patch, so hopefully, Treyarch sees that the fix isn't working as intended and is able to properly resolve the issue.\nThere will be plenty to come for Black Ops 6 fans throughout 2025. The new Squid Game update is just the start, with a constant stream of updates arriving via the Seasons. At the moment, it's unknown when Black Ops 6 Season 2 will be released, although considering Season 1 Reloaded launched at the start of December, it hopefully won't take too long to arrive from this point. A true fix for the Vermin glitch would be the cherry on top.\nby[in]\nPosted:\nRelated Forum:\n[Call of Duty Forum](/Forums/f=268/call-of-duty-forum.html)\nSource: https://gamerant.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-vermin-double-attack-bug-not-fixed/",
