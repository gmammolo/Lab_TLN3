  "text": "yesterday\nAm I the only one disappointed that Google is a NO-SHOW at this year's 2025 CES show. The Google Nest Security cameras are so old and outdated that I thought for sure it would happen. Many other home security cameras companies (including 3 new companies) have come thru with all sorts of new models with new features and improved image quality and storage options but Google has done nothing...... Such a shame.\nOh well.\n10 hours ago\nIs there anything on Google Home app updates ? For iOS? Anything?\n10 hours ago\nFound this… might be something???\nhttps://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/gemini-ai-smarts-are-coming-to-google-home-to-make-the-assi...\n52m ago\nHello and thanks for posting. This is kind cool but honestly there are so many other things needed before this pie-in-the-sky feature gets added. How about fixing all the FALSE ALERTS tell me there is a person there when there isn't. How about some newer cameras that have day-light ability at night. Or cameras that are higher res than 1K. How about a local base station so we don't need to spend $150/year for the cloud subscription..... I mean the list goes on and on.\n7 hours ago\nWith no new products from Google for quite a number of years, I think that Google has thrown in the towel with these products. I think that they are milking revenues from them for all they are worth, but they will dispose of the product line in some future time.\nMyself, even though I have five cameras from Nest and Google, and I am fully invested in the product line, I just bought and installed a Wyze floodlight camera for more than half the price of the Google floodlight. It seems to function quite properly and has an imbeded MicroSd card for video storage.",
