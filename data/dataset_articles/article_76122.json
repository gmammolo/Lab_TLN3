  "text": "In December, European officials launched an investigation into the sabotage of undersea internet cables in the Baltic Sea , allegedly severed by a Chinese-flagged vessel. Earlier this month, a similar incident near Taiwan centered around a Chinese vessel suspected of severing an undersea fiber-optic cable. The vessel in question was operating under multiple flags and identities in violation of international norms, likely in an effort to conceal its identity and obscure any links to Beijing. These incidents exemplify China’s use of “gray zone,” or hybrid warfare tactics—irregular, non-combat operations aimed at applying military pressure to adversaries, though pressure that falls short of eliciting a strong military response that could lead to open conflict.\nRecent incidents involving undersea cables align with China’s broader hybrid warfare strategy, a calculated blend of military and non-military tactics designed to achieve geopolitical goals while avoiding direct confrontation. The targeting critical infrastructure such as undersea cables highlights China’s ability to disrupt communication networks, undermining Taiwan’s economic stability and national security. Apart from the physical damage, these acts send a clear psychological message, generating uncertainty and emphasizing the vulnerabilities of Taiwan and its allies.\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has an established record of employing hybrid warfare as a strategic tool to assert dominance and destabilize opposition. In the South China Sea, Beijing’s approach integrates political, economic, military, and societal tactics to advance territorial claims and consolidate control over disputed areas while avoiding direct conflict. Key elements of the strategy include leveraging nonmilitary forces, such as the coast guard and maritime militias , employing intimidation tactics like ramming, shadowing, near-collisions, and using military-grade lasers.",
