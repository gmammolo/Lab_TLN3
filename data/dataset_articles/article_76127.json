  "text": "For the first time, a study shows the specific effects of persistent aircraft noise on the heart.\nIn the analysis of heart images using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), British researchers discovered that the left ventricle in individuals living near airports is on average seven percent heavier than in other individuals.\nAircraft Noise Increases Risk of Serious Cardiovascular Problems This increases the risk of serious cardiovascular problems such as arrhythmia, heart attack, or stroke by 32 percent, writes the group led by Cristian Topriceanu from University College London in the \"Journal of the American College of Cardiology\" (\"JACC\"). \"With the expansion of the aviation industry, concerns are growing in communities living near airports or under flight paths about possible impacts on quality of life and sleep,\" write the study authors. They evaluated heart images from 3,635 people living near one of four major English airports: London-Heathrow, London-Gatwick, Manchester, and Birmingham in a medical database - the UK Biobank.\nAfter matching with noise data from the British Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the scientists calculated that eight percent of these participants are exposed to an average continuous noise level of 50 decibels or more. Three percent lived with a nightly aircraft noise of 45 decibels or more. For comparison: 50 decibels is roughly equivalent to an animated conversation. The team determined the long-term risks from changes in the left ventricle from heart images and other data from 21,360 patients from the English database. In the risk calculation, the researchers took into account numerous other factors that could influence heart health - including gender, age, income, smoking, alcohol consumption, air quality, and other noise sources.\nEffects of Aircraft Noise on Obesity and High Blood Pressure Exactly how aircraft noise affects the cardiovascular system is not yet fully understood. However, there are indications that this noise environment is associated with obesity and high blood pressure. \"Between a quarter and half of the association was attributed to a higher body mass index in participants who were exposed to greater aircraft noise,\" Topriceanu is quoted in a statement from his university. In patients who were confronted with aircraft noise during the day, the researchers attributed between nine and 36 percent of the difference to higher blood pressure.\nThe body can respond to high blood pressure with an increased thickness growth of the heart muscle. In those affected by aircraft noise, a thickened heart wall made the greatest contribution to the on average seven percent heavier left ventricle. As a result, the heart becomes stiffer, can stretch less strongly, and the pumping performance decreases. \"Other factors that could be triggered by stress response to aircraft noise are sleep disorders, inflammation, and arteriosclerosis,\" emphasized Topriceanu.\n(APA/Red)\nThis article has been automatically translated, read the original article here .",
