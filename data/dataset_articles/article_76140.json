  "text": "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office for Civil Rights (OCR) concluded another HIPAA violation investigation, settling $337,750 with USR Holdings, LLC.\nNearly 3,000 patients’ electronic protected health information (ePHI) was retrieved by an “unauthorized third party/parties who were able to delete ePHI in the database,” according to an HHS [release](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/01/08/hhs-office-civil-rights-settles-hipaa-security-rule-investigation-usr-holdings-llc-concerning-deletion-electronic-protected-health-information.html).\nUpon conducting their investigation, OCR found the organization was failing to “conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis to determine the potential risks and vulnerabilities to ePHI in its systems; to regularly review its information system activity; and to establish and implement procedures to create and maintain retrievable exact copies of ePHI.”\nUSR will take several steps recommended by OCR to resolve and prevent future breaches.",
