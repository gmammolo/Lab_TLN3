  "text": "NEVADA COUNTY, Calif. — An investigation is underway after a PowerSchool data breach that could have taken some personal information from customers, like the\n[Pleasant Ridge Union School District](https://www.prsd.us/).\nThe\n[Grass Valley](/local) school district recently told families about a cybersecurity incident involving PowerSchool, a software that provides the student information system. The district was notified by PowerSchool on Jan. 7.\nOfficials said some of the information belongs to the district's families and educators. It includes data like contact information for students and parents and data elements like names and addresses.\n\"Across their (PowerSchool's) customer base, they have determined that some personally identifiable information (PII) was taken from some individuals. (PRUSD does not collect personally identifiable information like Social Security Numbers.) They are urgently working to complete their investigation and determine whether PII belonging to our students was included,\" said Superintendent Rusty Clark in a letter to parents.\nA full statement from PowerSchool is available below.\n\"On December 28, 2024, we became aware of a potential cybersecurity incident involving unauthorized access to certain PowerSchool SIS information through one of our community-focused customer portals, PowerSource. PowerSchool is not experiencing, nor expects to experience, any operational disruption and continues to provide services as normal to our customers.\nAs soon as we learned of the incident, we immediately engaged our cybersecurity response protocols and mobilized a cross-functional response team, including senior leadership and third-party cybersecurity experts.\nPowerSchool is committed to protecting the security and integrity of our applications. We take our responsibility to protect student data privacy and act responsibly as data processors extremely seriously.\nPowerSchool is committed to providing affected customers, families, and educators with the resources and support they may need as we work through this together.\"\nWATCH ALSO:",
