  "text": "2024 was a record-breaking year for the wrong reasons, as it unfortunately involved the largest and most destructive data breaches. These data breaches affected companies of all sizes and in every sector, costing the United States billions of dollars in damages. The major 2024 cyberattacks ranged from high-profile ransomware attacks crippling Change Healthcare and software maker CDK Global to the exploitation of a high severity zero-day vulnerability in Ivanti’s VPNs affecting thousands of users, the hijacking of hundreds of routers by both Russian and Chinese/PRC government-sponsored hackers, and the massive theft of data from Snowflake customer accounts using stolen credentials. According to IBM’s 2024 Cost of Data Breach Report, the average total cost of a data breach in the United States was $9.36 million, and the most common causes of a data breach were phishing and the use of stolen or compromised credentials.\n2024 also saw the expansion of cybersecurity regulations, including new breach notification requirements by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). Federal agencies, especially the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and FTC, are aggressively enforcing cybersecurity regulations and data privacy rights. These enforcement actions have been far-reaching and have demonstrated that corporate executives, as well as the corporate entity itself, could be held liable for mishandling cyberattacks, failing to implement adequate internal controls, and violating consumers’ privacy rights. Federal agencies have also begun bringing AI-related enforcement actions arising from deceptive and misleading disclosures that misrepresent the capabilities of AI tools and how AI tools are actually being used as well as the misuse of AI tools.\nNineteen states have now passed and enacted comprehensive data privacy laws, most of which are modeled after the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. States continue to revise and modify their data breach laws making them more stringent and complex. This has created an increasingly complex patchwork of state data privacy and data breach laws due to the lack of federal legislation.\nSimilarly, in the absence of federal Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) legislation, states have also started to fill this void in a patchwork manner. On May 17, 2024, Colorado became the first state to enact comprehensive AI legislation, which goes into effect in 2026. This law is groundbreaking and follows the same risk classification approach of the EU AI Act, and, among other things, imposes a duty of reasonable care on developers and deployers of high-risk AI systems to prevent algorithmic discrimination.[1] California, Illinois, Maryland, and New York City have also passed AI laws. Of particular significance is California’s Physicians Make Decisions Act, which went into effect on January 1, 2025 and ensures that decisions about medical treatments are made by health care providers, not solely determined by AI algorithms\nHere are the five top cybersecurity, AI, and privacy developments in 2024:\nNearly 170 million people in the United States had their health data compromised in 2024 according to data security incident reports made to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). 2024 began with the largest data breach of healthcare data ever reported compromising the protected health information and personal information of approximately 100 million individuals. The February 2024 ransomware attack of Change Healthcare, owned by UnitedHealth Group, crippled the U.S. healthcare system causing mass disruptions throughout the country. Change Healthcare was unable to process insurance claims and prescriptions for months. Hackers also stole patient data and reportedly offered the stolen healthcare data for sale on the dark web despite United Health Group having made a $22 million ransom payment to the ransomware group, BlackCat a/k/a ALPHV.\nSimilarly, hackers frequently targeted hospitals in 2024, creating significant threats to public safety when hospitals were forced to shut down, delay procedures, divert patients, and increase wait times in emergency rooms. Indeed, in May 2024, a ransomware attack disrupted the operations of Ascension Health Alliance, which operates approximately 140 hospitals in 19 states and Washington, D.C. Hospitals are often targeted because they have a broad attack surface and rely upon older, legacy systems that are difficult to update with cybersecurity safeguards and easier for hackers to penetrate. But even more troubling, hackers target hospitals and health care systems because they are more likely to pay a ransom because lives are at stake.\nAs a result of the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks on the health care sector, U.S regulators and lawmakers have proposed new cybersecurity rules to address this problem. On December 27, 2024, HHS proposed an overhaul and update to the HIPAA security rule comprising hundreds of pages of new regulations and safeguards to better protect the U.S. healthcare system from the increasing number of cyberattacks.[2] Among other things, these rules would require encryption of electronic protected health information (“ePHI”) at rest and in transit, the use of multi-factor authentication, network segmentation, vulnerability scanning at least every six months, and penetration testing and compliance audits at least once every 12 months.\nAI tools have supercharged cyberattacks allowing threat actors to scan, identify, and weaponize vulnerabilities in target networks far quicker than ever before. AI tools have also been used to craft more persuasive phishing emails, create voice clones to orchestrate fraud schemes, and develop malicious code and new variants of malware that is less likely to be detected by cybersecurity tools. Cybercriminals have used AI tools to automate large-scale ransomware and phishing campaigns. Further, nation states have begun weaponizing large language models for cyberattacks. In short, AI has already drastically changed the threat landscape and has enabled criminals to commit fraud on a much larger scale.[3]\nAI’s largest impact to date has been in the area of phishing attacks. According to SlashNext’s 2024 Phishing Intelligence Report, in the second half of 2024, there was a 202% increase in the total phishing messages and a 703% increase in credential phishing attacks.[4] Because phishing attacks are the most common ransomware vector, this is extremely alarming.\nOn August 22, 2024, in an unprecedented move, DOJ filed its first civil complaint under its Civil Cyber Fraud Initiative – a 99-page civil complaint-in-intervention against Georgia Institute of Technology (“Georgia Tech”) and Georgia Tech Research Corp. (“GTRC”) for failing to comply with cybersecurity requirements in its U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) contracts and violating the False Claims Act (“FCA”). Specifically, the complaint alleges that Georgia Tech failed to develop and implement a system security plan, failed to use anti-virus and anti-malware tools on the relevant devices, servers, and networks, and submitted a false cybersecurity assessment score to DoD. DOJ took over a whistleblower FCA lawsuit brought by two former senior members of Georgia Tech’s cybersecurity team and is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for violations of the FCA as well as breach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, and payment by mistake claims. Through this action, DOJ has issued a stark warning to government contractors and academia that cybersecurity is critical to the U.S. national defense and cybersecurity noncompliance will no longer be tolerated.\nDOJ established the Civil Cyber-Fraud Initiative in October 2021 with the intent to use the FCA to hold government contractors accountable for putting U.S. information and systems at risk by knowingly: (1) providing deficient cybersecurity products or services; (2) misrepresenting cybersecurity practices or protocols; or (3) failing to monitor and report cybersecurity incidents and breaches. DOJ’s decision to the use the FCA to enforce cybersecurity compliance was significant as it provides the government the means to recover treble damages while also incentivizing company insiders to report any cyber-related fraud. Since October 2021, DOJ has announced eight settlements (Comprehensive Health Services, Aerojet, JellyBean Communications, Verizon, Insight Global, Guidehouse, Nan Kay & Assoc., ASRC Federal Data Solution LLC and Pennsylvania State University) totaling nearly $30 million under the Civil Cyber Fraud Initiative. To date, DOJ’s investigations and settlements under this initiative have focused on compliance with cybersecurity requirements contained in federal contracts and subcontracts and failing to properly secure personally identifiable information (PII). Most recently on October 22, 2024, Penn State agreed to pay $1.25 million to resolve allegations that it violated cybersecurity requirements in 15 DoD and NASA contracts.\nIn 2024, U.S. governmental agencies have disclosed troubling details about several Chinese state-sponsored cyber campaigns involving Advanced Persistent Threat (“APT”) groups including, Volt Typhoon, Flax Typhoon, and Salt Typhoon. Volt Typhoon compromised numerous IT networks in the U.S. and was prepositioning itself to cause mass destruction to critical infrastructure in the event of a conflict with the U.S. The damage caused by Salt Typhoon’s infiltration of at least nine U.S. broadband providers, including AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen Technologies, has been described as “potentially catastrophic” as it allowed the PRC hackers to assess court-authorized wiretapping data, which may have provided the PRC insight on U.S. national security investigations,[5] and also gave the PRC hackers broad and full access to surveil telephone calls, text messages, and call record data of the targeted individuals. The full scope of who was targeted by the Chinese hackers is unknown, but Anne Neuberger, President Biden’s Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies, revealed that China targeted senior U.S. politicians in this cyberespionage campaign. In response to Salt Typhoon, the Federal Communications Commission has proposed stricter cybersecurity rules for telecom operators.\nMost recently, on December 30, 2024, U.S. Treasury Officials announced a “major” data breach of its network orchestrated by Chinese state-sponsored hackers. The hackers compromised a “key” used by a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, and were able to remotely access unclassified documents on workstations of the Treasury Department.[6] At this time, the U.S. Department of Treasury does not know the full impact of this incident according to a letter it sent to Congress.\nAs a result of concerns involving China’s increasing cyberattacks on the United States and the weaponization of U.S. personal and governmental data by U.S. foreign adversaries, on December 27, 2024, DOJ established a new national security program within DOJ’s National Security Division that prevents six “countries of concern” from gaining access to bulk sensitive U.S. personal data as well as U.S. government-related data under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”).[7] This new program is far-reaching and creates new prohibitions, reporting requirements, and compliance obligations for U.S. persons, including entities organized under the laws of the United States, that carries significant criminal penalties (i.e., 20 years imprisonment and $1 million dollar fine) for violations. This development underscores the importance of data in our evolving digital ecosystem and that the control over data is directly tied to U.S. national security.[8]\nThousands of class actions involving data security and privacy violations, including lawsuits based upon third-party website tracking tools, were filed in 2024. These lawsuits often coincide with enforcement actions by federal and state regulators and can be extremely costly. Indeed, National Public Data, the Florida business that was responsible for one of the largest data breaches affecting hundreds of millions of people in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, filed for bankruptcy last fall. It is facing more than a dozen class-action lawsuits and investigations by the FTC and more than 20 state regulators.\nIn October 2024, the SEC announced settlements of nearly $7 million with four public companies for issuing misleading public disclosures after learning that they were victims of a supply chain cyberattack that “negligently minimized” the cybersecurity incident and intentionally downplayed the material cybersecurity risks and impact on business operations. Additionally, in October 2024, the FTC and the Attorney Generals for 49 states and the District of Columbia jointly announced a $52 million dollar settlement with Marriott International, Inc. and its subsidiary Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide LLC resulting from its failure to implement reasonable data security that led to three large data breaches from 2014 to 2020 impacting more than 344 million customers worldwide. Data breach related securities class action filings also rose sharply in 2024 as did the settlements, which exceeded $550 million.\n[1]See Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act, available at https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-205.\n[2]See HIPAA Security Rule Fact Sheet, available at https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/hipaa-security-rule-nprm/factsheet/index.html.\n[3]See FBI’s Public Service Announcement, Dec. 3, 2024, Criminal Use Generative Artificial Intelligence to Facilitate Financial Fraud, available at https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2024/PSA241203.\n[4]See Alessandro Mascellino, Phishing Attacks Double in 2024, Infosecurity Magazine, Dec. 18, 2024, available at https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/2024-phishing-attacks-double/.\n[5]See Sarah Krouse, et al., U.S. Wiretap Systems Targeted in China-Linked Hack, WSJ, Oct. 5, 2024, available at Exclusive | U.S. Wiretap Systems Targeted in China-Linked Hack – WSJ.\n[6]See Raphael Satter and A.J.
