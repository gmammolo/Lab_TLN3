  "text": "2 hours ago\nThe latest in my ongoing attempts to upgrade from 1.6.13 to 1.8.38:\nAfter days of trying to update on the webserver, I finally gave up and took the backup and read it into a local linux machine and loaded myBB 1.8.38 and performed the update. Then I dumped the resulting SQL DB and reloaded it back into the web server. At first glance this seemed to work pretty good.\n(I do recall being alarmed when I saw a message \"Adding index files to attachment directories\" but hoped for the best, because I think it was too late anyway.)\nHowever, in the upgraded 1.8.38 version:\nmycodes in posts don't work. ie: posts that used to be properly formatted are now displayed with [b][/size][/font] etc. showing.\nAttachments seem gone - there are no indicators in the forum, and I see mycode-style text instead like:\n[attachment=14398][attachment=14399][attachment=14400][attachment=14401][attachment=14402]\nThank you for any clues.\nAfter days of trying to update on the webserver, I finally gave up and took the backup and read it into a local linux machine and loaded myBB 1.8.38 and performed the update.
