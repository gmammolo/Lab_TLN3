  "text": "NVIDIA ([NVDA](/stock/NVDA/summary), [Financial](/stock/NVDA/financials)) recently launched AI PC products, yet the sales for 2024 haven't seen the expected growth. The question arises whether NVIDIA should continue promoting these products or consider halting the project. The main obstacle to AI PC adoption is that AI technology initially emerged and was designed for cloud platforms. However, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the potential among designers, software engineers, creative professionals, and hobbyists interested in AI development on personal computers.\nLenovo, a key player in the global PC market, also weighed in on AI PCs in response to NVIDIA's stance. Luca Rossi, Lenovo's Executive VP, noted that the PC market remains stable in 2024, showing no significant growth compared to the previous year. However, he remains optimistic about future growth in 2025 and 2026, citing the upcoming end of the lifecycle for Windows 10 and 11 in October 2025, which will drive device upgrades.\nRossi predicts that AI PCs will become mainstream in the next few years, with a potential adoption rate of 40% to 80%. Instead of price wars, innovation is key to achieving this goal. While challenges like pricing, AI technology maturity, and a robust AI ecosystem remain, Rossi believes AI PCs will revolutionize productivity and gaming, offering new modes of use and significant enhancements in user experience.",
