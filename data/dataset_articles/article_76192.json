Women need to think carefully about opting for the implants, said plastic surgeons Rita Kappel and pathologist Evert van den Broek.\nThey have conducted and then published their research in the British Journal of Cancer Research. They concluded that silicone breast prostheses can begin shedding particles almost immediately after placement.\nUp to now, it was only assumed that older breast implants, which have been in the body for years, show leaks like this or “Sweat.” Affected women then report chronic fatigue, for example. According to Kappel, replacing old implants with new ones is, therefore, not a solution. According to her, sweating continues with the new ones, and the effects add up.\nThe scientists looked at tissue from seven women who reported no symptoms but were unhappy with their breast enlargement between 2018 and 2021. They wanted to get rid of the implants.\nThe scientists saw that silicone molecules can occur in the surrounding connective tissue capsule and spread further within three weeks after placement. \"This capsule, a natural reaction of the body, forms as a kind of covering layer around the prosthesis,\" they explained.\nThey advocate further research. \"Think before you leap,\" they tell candidates for implants in the meantime. \"The best thing is no implant at all,\" said Kappel.\nReporting by ANP",
