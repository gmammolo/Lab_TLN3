  "text": "Cluster of new mpox variant found in China: Know what it is\nChinese health officials have identified a new mutated strain of mpox, clade Ib, in a foreigner who travelled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\nIn Short\n- China has discovered a cluster of new mpox strain, clade Ib\n- The WHO declared mpox a public health emergency due to the spread of the strain\n- The strain has higher virulence causing skin rash and blisters\nChinese health officials have detected a new mutated strain of mpox, called clade Ib, as the virus continues to spread to more countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared mpox a global public health emergency last year.\nChina's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported a cluster of cases linked to a foreigner who had travelled to and lived in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\nFour additional cases were found among people who had close contact with this individual. The symptoms in these patients are mild and include skin rashes and blisters.\nMpox spreads through close contact and causes flu-like symptoms along with pus-filled lesions on the skin. While it is usually not severe, it can be fatal in rare cases.\nIn August last year, the WHO declared mpox a global health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak in Congo that spread to neighbouring countries.\nThe outbreak in Congo initially involved an endemic strain called clade I. However, the clade Ib variant is thought to spread more easily through regular close contact, including sexual contact.\nThis new variant has since spread to neighbouring countries like Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, prompting the WHO's emergency declaration.\nIn response, China announced in August last year that it would monitor people and goods entering the country for mpox.\nThe National Health Commission also classified mpox as a Category B infectious disease. This allows authorities to take emergency measures such as restricting public gatherings, suspending work and school, or locking down areas during an outbreak.\nIndia had reported the mpox clade Ib strain last year September. This newer strain is known for its higher virulence, leading to more severe symptoms and complications.\nPatients infected with the strain are at greater risk of experiencing serious health issues, including a higher mortality rate of up to 10%.\nAccording to a report published in Nature, \"Clade Ib seems to be different, and is spreading largely through contact between humans, including through sex. Around 18,000 suspected cases of mpox, many of them among children, and at least 600 deaths potentially attributable to the disease have been reported this year (2024) in the DRC alone.\"\nOther health conditions can affect death rates. For example, people with untreated HIV are twice as likely to die from mpox compared to the general population. This is especially significant in many African countries where a large number of people live with HIV.\nWHAT IS MPOX?\nMpox is a severe illness caused by the monkeypox virus, which was first identified in 1958. It causes fever, chills, body aches, headache, muscle pain, and fatigue, with the highlighting signs being a skin rash that develops into blisters and sores.\nThe virus also causes swollen lymph nodes in some cases.\nA person infected with the virus must be isolated as the infection is easily transferrable to another with close contact via person, animal and contaminated materials.\nWhile most cases of mpox are mild and can resolve on their own. Severe cases require antiviral treatment.\nThe virus has two distinct clades: clade I (with subclades Ia and Ib) and clade II (with subclades IIa and IIb).\nThe one that led to WHO's emergency declaration was clade Ib.\nIn September, the WHO approved the first mpox vaccine, MVA-BN, for the prequalification list. The MVA-BN vaccine is administered as a two-dose injection given four weeks apart, and approved for people over 18 years old.\nAfter being stored in cold conditions, it can remain stable at temperatures between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius for up to eight weeks.\n(With inputs from Reuters)",
