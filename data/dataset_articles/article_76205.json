  "text": "Hi everyone! How are you all doing tonight? I just had a frustrating experience trying to set up a free #domain or #subdomain for my #SelfHosted services. Unfortunately, I can’t use my laniecarmelo.tech domain because its current configuration doesn’t allow me to add subdomains.\nI discovered EU.org, which offers free domains, and decided to give it a try. However, they require you to have authoritative #DNS #nameservers before requesting a domain. I tried using #Cloudflare, but it wasn’t authoritative. Then I looked into Hostry.com, Hurricane Electric DNS, and FreeDNS.\nHostry requires you to add DNS records for your domain before using their service—but how can I do that when my domain doesn’t exist yet? 🤦♀️ As for FreeDNS and Hurricane Electric, both have inaccessible #CAPTCHAs on their registration forms with no audio alternatives! 😡\nAt this point, I’m so frustrated that I’ve decided to take a break from figuring this out. If anyone has tips for setting up a free domain or knows of accessible DNS services, I’d really appreciate your advice! 🙏\n#Accessibility #TechFrustration #WebHosting #BlindTech #blind #DisabilityInTech #tech #Technology #SelfHosting\n@selfhost @selfhosting @selfhosted @mastoblind @main\nlog in or registerto comment.\n@RareBird15@selfhost@selfhosting@selfhosted@mastoblind@mainAlso, having to add NS entries before registering the domain is the usual way. Most registrars even check that on registration, I’d say\n@RareBird15@selfhost@selfhosting@selfhosted@mastoblind@main\nI’m assuming by “current configuration” you have a DNS host that doesn’t allow adding NS records? One thing you might be able to do is create records like:host1.subdomain.laniecarmelo.tech A 1.2.3.4\nhost2.subdomain.laniecarmelo.tech A 1.2.3.5In my DNS host I can create a host1.subdomain A record without creating an actual subdomain (e.g. creating a subdomain.laniecarmelo.tech NS record).\n@virtuous_sloth@selfhost@selfhosting@selfhosted@mastoblind@mainNo, my situation is weird. My domain is hosted onPorkbun.combut its nameservers point toVultr.com, where my WordPress install is hosted on a friend’s server. Porkbun won’t let me edit DNS records or do much of anything with my domain unless I change back to the default nameservers, which would break my WordPress setup.@RareBird15@selfhost@selfhosting@selfhosted@mastoblind@main\nah, gotcha. I do hope that you find a solution.\nThis seems overly complicated. Why not just get a domain on cloud flare for $10? Are free domains even a thing outside github pages\niirc, cloudflare domains are literally at cost.\nI’ve only hosted public sites for a year or so but cloudflare, cloudflare proxy, pointing at my servers is very easy :)\n.coms are the cheapest at 10.44 I think",
