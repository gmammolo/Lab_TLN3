  "title": "TikTok Ban News: Final days for TikTok? App faces ban in US as Jan. 19 deadline looms, ET BrandEquity",
  "text": "TikTok logoTikTok, the widely-used social media app owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, faces a critical decision from the US Supreme Court that could determine its future in the United States. Unless ByteDance sells TikTok to a US-based company by January 19, the platform could be removed from app stores and blocked by internet providers, as mandated by a bipartisan law signed by President Joe Biden in 2023.The legislation stems from growing concerns over national security, with lawmakers asserting that TikTok’s parent company could share sensitive user data with the Chinese government or use the platform to spread disinformation. ByteDance, however, has categorically denied these allegations, stating in an April 2023 statement, “ByteDance does not have any plans to sell TikTok,” calling the sale rumours \\\"untrue.\\\"Supreme Court to Hear Arguments on Free Speech and SecurityTikTok has challenged the law, filing an emergency motion claiming it violates the First Amendment and could result in \\\"substantial losses.\\\" The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments on January 10. The central legal question revolves around whether the government’s concerns about national security justify overriding the First Amendment’s protections for free speech.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, has supported the law, stating, \\\"The right to free speech enshrined in the First Amendment does not apply to a corporate agent of the Chinese Communist Party.\\\" In contrast, Jameel Jaffer, Executive Director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, criticised this perspective. “It is not the government’s role to tell us which ideas are worth listening to,” he argued.Efforts to Purchase TikTok’s US OperationsAmid these legal and political debates, several entrepreneurs have expressed interest in acquiring TikTok's US operations. One prominent bidder is Shark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary, who described the opportunity as \\\"about something much bigger: protecting the privacy of 170 million American users.” In a January 6 post on X (formerly Twitter), O’Leary added, “It’s about empowering creators and small businesses. And it’s about building a platform that prioritises PEOPLE over algorithms.”O’Leary revealed that his efforts would require collaboration with President-elect Donald Trump, who will assume office on January 20. “Trump will be who we have to work with to close the deal in the months ahead,” O’Leary said during a January 6 interview on Fox News. “So, I wanted to let him know—as well as others in his cabinet—that we’re doing this, and we’re going to need their help.”This case brings to light the delicate balance between free speech and national security, a debate the Supreme Court has addressed in past cases. In the landmark 2010 decision in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, the Court upheld restrictions on speech linked to foreign entities deemed threats to national security, while also applying strict judicial scrutiny.Earlier cases, such as the 1971 Pentagon Papers decision, showed the Court’s reluctance to allow the government to suppress information, even in the name of security. Justice Hugo Black, in his concurrence, wrote, “The word ‘security’ is a broad, vague generality whose contours should not be invoked to abrogate the fundamental law embodied in the First Amendment.”This tension is further highlighted by differing opinions. A brief from the Knight First Amendment Institute argues that the law banning TikTok “is far more aggressive” than prior measures, as it outright prohibits access to the platform. On the other hand, Zephyr Teachout, a law professor at Fordham University, argues that regulating foreign ownership is distinct from restricting free speech. “The regulations are wholly concerned with the firms’ ownership, not the firms’ conduct, technology, or content,” Teachout noted.The Broader ImplicationsThe Supreme Court’s decision will carry far-reaching implications, not only for TikTok but for digital platforms operating in sensitive political contexts. With TikTok’s sophisticated algorithm providing personalised content to over 170 million US users, many of them young, its potential ban would mark the end of a cultural phenomenon.As legal arguments unfold, the case will serve as a litmus test for how governments can balance safeguarding national security while preserving the foundational principles of free expression in a globally connected digital era.",
