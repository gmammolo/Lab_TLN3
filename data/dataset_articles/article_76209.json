  "text": "Axon cancels groundbreaking of new headquarters in Scottsdale\nSCOTTSDALE, AZ (AZFamily) — Axon, the company that makes Tasers and police body cameras, is halting its proposed new headquarters and housing project in north Scottsdale but said it remains committed to the community.\nThe company said it’s canceling the current multi-million project just two days before it was scheduled to break ground.\nThe Scottsdale City Council [approved the proposal in November](https://www.azfamily.com/2024/11/20/scottsdale-city-council-approves-axon-headquarters-housing-plan/), but an [effort to stop the development](https://www.azfamily.com/2024/12/09/battle-over-scottsdale-signatures-gets-ugly-axon-petition-protester-arrested/) reportedly gathered enough signatures to put it on the ballot for voters.\nAxon founder and CEO Rick Smith said it’s not worth the risk that the project could be delayed even further, so he’s expanding a bid for the new headquarters to other states. Still, the company said it’s “deeply committed” to staying in Scottsdale.\nAxon representatives said the company expects to make a final decision on its headquarters location in the coming months.\nThe proposal included a massive 250,000-square-foot headquarters and manufacturing center with around 2,000 residential units and spacing for retail shops at a plot of land near Loop 101 and Hayden Road.\nThe project’s groundbreaking was set for Friday.\nCritics of the project [called the project a monstrosity](https://www.azfamily.com/2024/12/05/scottsdale-residents-gathering-signatures-strike-down-approved-axon-development/) and are largely against new housing developments in the city.\nSmith claims a California-based labor union leads the ballot referendum.\n“We can’t allow political games to put our mission or our team at risk. Our focus remains on saving lives, improving public safety and attracting the brightest minds to join us. If that means relocating to a community that fully supports those goals, we’re prepared to make that move,” he said in a written statement.\nSmith cites a Rounds Consulting Group impact study that said the proposed complex was going to be privately funded, bring in 5,500 jobs and would have generated $11.5 million in city tax revenues, Smith said.\nAxon has been in Scottsdale since 1993.\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?
