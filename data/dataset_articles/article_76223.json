  "text": "Reflective, high-visibility clothing may stand out to human drivers at night, but a recent study suggests it may be invisible to a vehicle's automated crash prevention technology.\nThe study, conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) in the US, set out to determine the effectiveness of autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems detecting pedestrians wearing reflective clothing at night.\nWhile IIHS research in the past has shown AEB systems reduce the rate of pedestrian-related incidents of all severities by 27 per cent, the safety system's night-time limitations are described as \"a serious problem\", as most fatal pedestrian crashes occur at night.\nAccording to the IIHS, automakers are working to address such issues, though the non-profit organisation aimed to further investigate \"the effects of conspicuous clothing and increased roadway lighting\" on the performance of pedestrian AEB systems with its latest research.\n100s of new car deals are available through CarExpert right now.

[Browse now](https://www.carexpert.com.au/new-car-deals/).\nAs part of the study, the IIHS gathered three 2023 cars – a [Honda CR-V](https://www.carexpert.com.au/honda/cr-v), [Mazda CX-5](https://www.carexpert.com.au/mazda/cx-5), and [Subaru Forester](https://www.carexpert.com.au/subaru/forester) – which are all fitted with pedestrian AEB systems.\nMultiple trials were subsequently conducted with an adult-sized dummy dressed in all black; all white; black pants with a fully reflective jacket; and all black with reflective strips – the latter of which intended to mimic outfits worn by road construction workers but without the typical bright yellow or orange.\nThe dummy would then traverse a pedestrian crossing in three different roadway lighting scenarios. One featured no roadway lighting at all, another at 10 lux (twilight), and the final at 20 lux (the legal requirement for crossings in the US).\nAll three vehicles approached the crossing at 25mp/h (40.2km/h).\nWhen the dummy was dressed in black, both the CR-V and CX-5 slowed substantially when using their high-beams with no road illumination. In the same lighting conditions but using low-beam lights, the CR-V failed to slow at all, and the CX-5 reduced its speed by less than one-third. Both vehicles performed better with 20 lux of additional light.\nThe Honda could not detect the dummy when it was dressed in white with no road illumination, but improved in the 10 and 20 lux scenarios. Both cars began to struggle significantly when reflective clothing was introduced.\n\"When the dummy was dressed in the reflective jacket, the CR-V didn't slow in any of the trials, regardless of additional roadway lighting,\" the IIHS wrote in its release\n\"In contrast, with no roadway illumination and with 10 lux of added light, the CX-5 slowed much more than it did when the dummy was clad in black. But with 20 lux of added light, it performed worse with the dummy in the reflective jacket than when it was wearing the black outfit.\"\nWhen the dummy was adorned with reflective strips, both the Honda and Mazda failed to slow in all lighting scenarios.\n\"The placement and motion of reflective strips on the joints and limbs of pants and jackets allows drivers to quickly recognise the pattern of movement as a person,\" IIHS senior research scientist and study author David Kidd said.\n\"Unfortunately, the moving strips didn't have the same effect for the pedestrian AEB systems we tested and probably confounded their sensors.\"\nThe IIHS says \"it's not clear\" why the CR-V and CX-5 struggled with the dummy's reflective strips or how many other manufacturers' systems also face the same limitiations.\nAs for the Forester, which was fitted with Subaru's established EyeSight safety technology, it came to a complete stop in every trial except one, in which the dummy was wearing reflective strips and the roadway was illuminated to 10 lux.\nEven in that test, the IIHS reports it slowed by \"more than 80 per cent\".\nThe IIHS suggests further research is required to fully understand how crash avoidance systems respond to the clothing worn by road construction crews and emergency workers, while organisation president David Harkey described the shortcomings as a \"worrisome blind spot\".\n\"These results suggest that some automakers need to tweak their pedestrian automatic emergency braking systems,\" Mr Harkey said.\n\"It's untenable that the clothes that pedestrians, cyclists and roadway workers wear to be safe may make them harder for crash avoidance technology to recognise.\"\nIt's not the first time issues with pedestrian AEB technology have been reported.\nGeneral Motors (GM) was in hot water for an incident in which [one of its Cruiser autonomous robo-taxis hit a pedestrian](https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/gms-driverless-car-division-admits-failings-after-pedestrian-collision), after which the company admitted to many critical failings.\nContent originally sourced from: [CarExpert.com.au](https://www.carexpert.com.au)",
