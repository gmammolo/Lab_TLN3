  "text": "The beginning of CES 2025 caused quite a stir amongst Nintendo fans. Loads of Switch 2 leaks and rumors appeared, and since then, it has been a steady stream of them. It has been quite a week, and there has been a lot of questions about what Nintendo may do in response. The likely theory is that Nintendo will continue with their current plans.\nHowever, that isn’t stopping Nintendo from saying a bit about the matter. For the first time since CES 2025, Nintendo has made some official remarks. They did so to Japanese outlet Sankei, who had reached out to them for a comment. What may surprise you is that the company representative that replied back didn’t actually say that the content is fake. In fact, they only said that “the images and videos are not official”.\nIt may as well have been a “no comment”, but it’s certainly not going to help Nintendo that their response may have only served to add more evidence suggesting that what we’ve seen and heard about the Switch 2 from CES 2025 is likely real and true. Still, the company has already stated that an official reveal of the console is coming within this fiscal year. At most, we have less than a few months to go.",
