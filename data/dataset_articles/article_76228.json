  "text": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Telecommunications Limited (PTCL) said on Thursday there was no exact timeframe for the resolution of slow internet connectivity or the repair of the Asia-Africa-Europe-1 (AAE-1) undersea internet cable, Dawn.com reported.\nPTCL spokesperson Aamir Pasha said that to address the slowdown, PTCL “added additional bandwidth which has majorly resolved [the] internet slowness issue”.\nHowever, the telecom operator stated that slow internet speed might still be experienced on Meta-owned services, such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, especially during peak hours.\n“We expect complete resolution over the next few days,” the statement added, without giving an exact timeframe.\n“PTA and PTCL are working diligently to ensure the earliest possible resolution.”\nMr Pasha said that the bandwidth shortfall had “been addressed”.\nMeanwhile, PTCL technical personnel said that problems of this nature take between two and three months to fix, but the spokesperson did not offer any comment on this claim.\nPublished in Dawn, January 10th, 2025",
