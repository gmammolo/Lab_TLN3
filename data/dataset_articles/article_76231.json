  "text": "In January 2022, Dunzo appeared unstoppable fresh from raising $240 million led by Reliance Retail. The company promised to deliver groceries to millions of Indians within 15 minutes.Three years on, Kabeer Biswas, its sole remaining founder has left Dunzo marking the end of a venture that pioneered India's hyperlocal delivery movement. ETtech reported on Thursday that Biswas has joined Flipkart to lead the ecommerce major’s quick commerce business Minutes.A closer look at the events of the past few years reveals a series of strategic missteps, financial mismanagement, and operational challenges that eventually led to the downfall of Dunzo.The hyper-growth trapAfter closing its largest fundraise in 2022 where Reliance Retail invested $200 million, Dunzo ramped up its operations, pushing for hyper-growth. Its aggressive expansion of Dunzo Daily, a 15-20-minute grocery delivery service, became the central focus.The company's monthly expenses ballooned to more than Rs 100 crore, fuelled by expensive India Premier League (IPL) sponsorship and marketing campaigns that tripled business volume but led to unsustainable cash burn. Despite its expansion efforts, Dunzo struggled to shed its image as primarily a courier service rather than a quick commerce contender.As cash reserves dwindled and funding proved elusive, the company was forced to extend its delivery promise from 15 minutes to 60 minutes, hoping to lower costs through order batching. The problems multiplied by mid-2023 amid a broader funding slowdown in India's startup ecosystem.Failed investments, M&AsA potential investment from fintech PhonePe in Dunzo's merchant network business failed to materialise, with the deal's collapse partly attributed to concerns from other investors about PhonePe's Walmart backing.Similarly, Flipkart’s offer to acquire the company hit a wall when investors opposed selling the Dunzo brand.Even Reliance Retail, which held a 26 per cent stake in Dunzo, remained reluctant to infuse additional capital. The company's attempts to raise funds through a rights issue at a significantly reduced valuation highlighted its increasingly desperate financial situation.The ambitious expansion from seven cities to 15-16 proved to be a critical misstep. Dunzo was already grappling with operational challenges and mounting costs in existing markets when it pursued this aggressive scaling.Business crumblesA belated strategic pivot to focus on Bengaluru and Pune came too late, as competitors like Swiggy Instamart had already cemented their market dominance.Zepto, too, had begun scaling operations and emerged as the third major player.Internal stability crumbled as financial pressures mounted. Five board members, including co-founders Dalvir Suri and Mukund Jha, departed. Employees faced months of delayed salaries, some extending into 2023, while multiple rounds of layoffs followed.This reflected in Dunzo's FY23 financials as its losses more than tripled to over Rs 1,800 crore even as revenue grew fourfold to Rs 226 crore.The company's ventures into business-to-business (B2B) logistics through Dunzo Merchant Services and its platform integration with the government’s Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) proved insufficient to address the fundamental cash flow challenges.In a last ditch effort it tried securing $20 million from existing investors but that too didn't come through.What’s next?Throughout its 10-year journey, Dunzo's aggressive focus on rapid growth, driven partly by investor expectations, came at the cost of sustainable business practices.Having raised $450 million in all, the company was last valued at $745 million. It counted Google, Lightbox and Blume Ventures as its investors with Reliance being its single largest shareholder.The company compromised on unit economics and cost control in its pursuit of market share. Marketing strategies, including substantial spending on IPL sponsorships and unprofitable growth tactics, placed a heavy burden on finances without delivering long-term value.The reliance on external funding became particularly problematic when the investment climate soured.Unable to secure timely investments, Dunzo faced mounting liabilities and boardroom instability. The erosion of investor trust accelerated as it struggled to meet its financial obligations to vendors and employees, marking a stark reversal for a startup that once symbolised the potential of India's hyperlocal delivery segment.Dunzo’s debt of around $60 million remains a drag on its books.Several cases have been filed against the startup, with at least two of them being heard at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). A final verdict is awaited in these cases from the tribunal.The Dunzo brand remains with the company but there is hardly any presence left for any senior executive to run the company. Biswas is finally out from Dunzo and with that, Dunzo's two years of struggle and toil come to a long-awaited end.",
