After rumours were milling, we finally get to see the SteamOS powered Lenovo Legion Go S, and its smaller than the original Legion Go.\n“As the S in the name would suggest, this latest offering is smaller than the Legion Go that Lenovo debuted last year. More specifically it features a smaller 8″ display, with a WUXGA 16:10 120Hz PureSight touch panel present. In terms of controls, the chassis sports fused TrueStrike controllers with adjustable trigger switches and hall-effect joysticks,” writes our Robin-Leigh Chetty.\nLenovo Legion Go S powered by SteamOS sees light of day NSFAS The only NSFAS channels you can trust Gaming Dragon Ball villains, STW oldie returns to Fortnite LEGO Bluey LEGO sets are coming this year Internet culture VLC working on AI-powered subtitles as it crosses 6 billion downloads",
