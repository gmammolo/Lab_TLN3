  "text": "Quick Summary: Bitcoin Options OI hits record lows, reflecting a shift to cautious trading amid market uncertainties.\nThis trend is further amplified by declining volumes and subdued price action, which collectively indicate a lack of strong catalysts for significant market moves.\nThe current drop underscores a retreat by market participants from leveraged positions, likely influenced by global economic pressures and fears of sustained rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.",
