  "text": "Abstract\nDue to the well-documented negative environmental impacts of conventional plastics,\nthe use of bioplastics has been increasing. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is currently among the\nmost common and industrially available bioplastics. Although PLA is compostable under\nindustrial conditions and generally degrades more quickly than conventional plastics, its\nbreakdown in typical environmental settings remains problematic. PLA’s potential to\ncontribute to plastic pollution through the release of microplastics and nanoplastics makes\nit crucial to understand how these particles behave, especially in marine environments.\nHowever, as for all nanoplastics, identifying, isolating, and quantifying PLA nanoplastics\nin water presents significant challenges. This study proposes a versatile approach to\nfabricate PLA nanoplastics through laser ablation in a water environment to mimic realworld\nsamples. Commencing with bulk PLA films, this top-down method yields the\nformation of nanoplastics with an average diameter of 54.7 ± 26.7 nm. Surface and\nchemical analyses confirm the presence of carboxylic groups on their surface, potentially\nresembling the environmental degradation pathway of PLA under exposure to sunlight\nand humid environments. This indicates that the proposed process results in a PLA\nnanoplastics system that serves as an invaluable reference model, enabling realistic\nenvironmental scenario explorations and simulations for risk assessment evaluations on\nbio-based nanoplastics.",
