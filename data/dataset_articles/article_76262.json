  "text": "PORTLAND Ore. (KPTV) - The Portland Police Bureau is working to identify a pair of porch pirates who stole drone equipment from a Southwest Portland home.\nA Portland couple was expecting a package to be delivered to their home near Multnomah Village on Wednesday. However, they never received it.\nOn Thursday, when they checked their Arlo security camera footage, they saw that a package had been delivered by DHL on Wednesday.\nLater in the footage, a man is seen stealing a box from their front door.\n“You live in a place that’s home, and someone kind of bursts that bubble of safety and takes what belongs to you,” the couple said.\nAnother Arlo camera captures the moments before and after the theft. The same man and another individual are seen in a black sedan in front of their driveway. The man hops out of the vehicle and walks toward the family’s home, while another individual in a gray hoodie steals an Amazon package from a neighbor.\nSEE ALSO:\nThe search for an armed robbery suspect in the Kenton neighborhood had ended and a shelter-in-place order has been lifted, according to the Portland Police Bure Both thieves throw the stolen packages into the trunk of the sedan and drive away from the neighborhood.\nAccording to the couple, their neighbor had shower items and a shoe rack stolen.\nThe couple distributes components for the drone industry. They said that inside their package were customized parts for specialized drones meant for mission-critical projects for customers like utilities, forest fire management, and the U.S. Department of Defense.\n“Replacing the stolen items is not simple and could delay mission-critical projects that are intended for the protection of infrastructure and public safety,” one of them said.\nBecause of the unique nature of the items, the couple believes it would be easy to detect them if they showed up on the “used market.”\nAnyone with information about the suspects is encouraged to contact the Portland Police Bureau.\nCopyright 2025 KPTV-KPDX.
