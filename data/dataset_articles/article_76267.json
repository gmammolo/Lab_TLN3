  "text": "For queries about your TalkTalk broadband service.\nSunday\nMy broadband is starting to play up again, losing connection that is cured by turning the router off/on.\nI'm always worried when I see Openreach playing around in the junction box at the bottom of the road. I swear they swap bad lines over to sort out other peoples connection problems...\nIt's also rained a lot, which is normally when things go wrong as well.\nLandline is also not as clear as it once was.\n29 minutes ago\nHi Steve\nThanks for your reply. DLM may still continue to increase the speed if the connection remains stable.\n30 minutes ago\nThanks for checking back.\nSo far it seems to be OK, although download is still slower at around 45Mb/s than the 55 or so I was getting.\nRegards,\nSteve\n50 minutes ago\nMorning Steve,\nJust checking back in to see how your connection has been over the last few days?\nThanks\nMichelle\nTuesday\nMorning Steve,\nThanks for the update. We'll check back in with you in a few days to see how the connection compares and if it has remained consistent.\nThanks\nMichelle\nMonday\nAfternoon Chris,\nSo far today there has been no problems at all, speed is at about 46Mb/s which is down a bit, but is OK.\nMaybe Openreach have finished with the junction box?!?!\nRegards,\nSteve\nMonday\nHi Ellie53,\nIf you still need assistance can you please start your own thread/topic and well be happy to help\nChris\nMonday\nHi Qwghlm,\nHow are you getting on, are you still experiencing problems?\nChris\nSunday\nMy internet went down at midday. My phone was ok though. The router was showing solid orange light even after multi attempts to restart it. As of about 5 minutes ago, it seems to be working again.\nSunday\nSpeed is also down to about 38Mb/s when it was in the mid 50's",
