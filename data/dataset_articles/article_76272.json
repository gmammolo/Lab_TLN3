  "text": "Canon USA has released a statement on its website about corrupted recordings when using certain SanDisk SD cards in the Canon R5 Mark II .\nThe cards that are not compatible are the SanDisk Extreme PRO SDXC UHS-II 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB V60 cards.\nI cannot stress this enough, make sure you use approved media in your cameras that has been tested by the camera manufacturer! If you don’t you are playing Russian Roulette. This is exactly the reason camera manufacturers put out these lists in the first place. While using media on an approved list is no guarantee, it is one step closer to making sure you don’t have any issues.\nBelow is what the statement from Canon USA says in full:\nThank you for choosing Canon products.\nStill images taken with Canon EOS R5 Mk II may be recorded as corrupted/abnormal due to incompatibility of certain SanDisk Extreme PRO SDXC UHS-II 64GB, 128GB and 256GB V60 cards.\nFor more information, please see the link to SanDisk support:\nSteps to Resolve SanDisk Extreme PRO® SDXC™ UHS-II V60 64, 128, and 256GB Still Image Problem with a Canon EOS R5 Mark II | SanDisk\nTo learn about compatible SanDisk Memory Cards for EOS R5 Mark II, please visit the below link.\nLearn About Compatible SanDisk Memory Cards for the Canon EOS R5 Mark II Camera | SanDisk\nBelow I have listed what cards are compatible and have been tested by Canon for use with the R5 Mark II.\nThis information is only for residents of the United States and its five territories.
