  "text": "Produced by: Mohsin Shaikh\nBeneath Antarctica’s icy façade lies a massive network of over 100 active volcanoes, kept in check by the crushing weight of ice. But as the ice melts, the threat of eruptions looms closer.\nRepresentative pic\nA study in Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems reveals how melting ice is reducing pressure on magma chambers, destabilizing them and potentially triggering volcanic eruptions.\nAs ice thins, the Earth’s crust loses its suppressive weight. Magma decompression begins, releasing trapped gases, which increase internal pressure and the likelihood of eruptions.\nVolcanic eruptions generate heat that melts more ice, which in turn exposes more bedrock and allows magma to rise, creating a self-sustaining cycle of fire and ice.\nRepresentative pic\nAntarctica’s volcanic awakening isn’t just a local threat. Rising sea levels and injected volcanic gases, like CO2, could alter weather systems and accelerate global warming.\nWest Antarctica’s melting ice sheet could raise sea levels by several meters, but volcanic heat could cause the destabilized sheet to collapse faster than current predictions suggest.\nAsh and aerosols from under-ice eruptions may disrupt atmospheric conditions, warming the Southern Ocean and compounding the climate crisis on a global scale.\nRepresentative pic\nScientists warn that even if human emissions stopped, the melting and eruption cycle could perpetuate itself, making this a long-term, autonomous threat.\nRepresentative pic\nAdvanced monitoring technologies, including satellite imaging and remote sensing, are essential to track Antarctic volcanic activity and prepare for the cascading impacts of this hidden danger.\nRepresentative pic",
