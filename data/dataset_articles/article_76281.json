  "text": "[Science News](https://www.news9live.com/science)\nBlue Origin postpones New Glenn launch because of choppy seas in landing area\nBlue Origin has deferred the first flight of its New Glenn rocket. The launch is now scheduled for no sooner than 12 Jan.\nNew Delhi: The highly anticipated debut flight of Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket has been delayed to no sooner than 12 January, 2025. The delay is because of rough seas where the first stage, designed to be reusable at least for 25 flights, will attempt to land on an ocean platform dubbed Jacklyn. The primary objective of the mission is to just reach orbit, and the recovery of the first stage on the ocean platform is a stretch goal, and an ambitious one for the first flight of the launch vehicle. The flight was supposed to take place today. The three hour long launch window opens up at 11:30 hours IST on Sunday.\nThe primary payload on board is the Blue Ring Pathfinder, which will test the core flight, ground systems and operational capabilities of the Blue Ring spacecraft, also developed by Blue Origin. Blue Ring can be compared to a space tugboat, with the capability of rapidly shifting between orbits, that can host a variety of payloads and provide transportation, refueling, data relay and logistics services all the way from various orbital regimes around the Earth to Cislunar space. Blue Ring is designed to accommodate both government and commercial customers.\nFirst Flight of the New Glenn\nThe first New Glenn flight will demonstrate multiple new hardware elements developed by Blue Origin, owned by Jeff Bezos, including the launch vehicle, the ocean platform to recover the reusable first stage, and the innovative Blue Ring orbital platform. Blue Origin plans to iterate and improve on the hardware based on the learnings of the first flight. SVP of the New Glenn project, Jarrett Jones says, “This is our first flight and we’ve prepared rigorously for it. But no amount of ground testing or mission simulations are a replacement for flying this rocket. It’s time to fly. No matter what happens, we’ll learn, refine, and apply that knowledge to our next launch.”\nClick for more latest [Science news](https://www.news9live.com/science).
