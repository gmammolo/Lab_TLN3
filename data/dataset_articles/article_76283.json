  "text": "Read full article HuffPost Stephen Colbert Has A Brutal Community Note For Mark Zuckerberg's Meta Changes Ben Blanchet January 10, 2025 at 8:47 a.m. · 1 min read Link Copied\nStephen Colbert on Thursday mocked Mark Zuckerberg ’s changes to Meta after the tech billionaire announced that the company would trash its fact-checking program in favor of a “community notes”-like system for posts similar to that of X .\n“No, do not trust the community, the worst part about social media is other people,” Colbert quipped.\nThe “ Late Show ” host noted that Zuckerberg is joining an intensifying race to “kiss” President-elect’s Donald Trump ’s “ass” after he revealed that Meta companies — like Instagram and Facebook — would do away with a fact-checking program that he dubbed “too politically biased.”\nZuckerberg, who joins other Silicon Valley billionaires trying to apple-polish Trump ahead of his inauguration, met with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago in November and also donated $1 million to his inauguration fund.\nADVERTISEMENT Prior to Trump’s recent election win, Trump reportedly accused Zuckerberg of having “steered” Facebook against him in the 2020 election and threatened him with spending “rest of his life in prison” were he to “cheat” in the 2024 contest.\nColbert, on Thursday, highlighted how other people are the “worst” part about social media platforms by turning to an “ actual Facebook post ” from NPR highlighting two giant pandas living it up in the snow at The National Zoo.\n“So of course, somebody commented, ‘Daily reminder that the US is sending tax payer funds to the Taliban, weekly,’” the “Late Show” host noted.\n“The pandas cannot help you with that, my man. They don’t even know how to have sex .”\nWatch more of Colbert’s Thursday monologue below.\nRelated...
