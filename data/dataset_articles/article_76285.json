  "text": "Recharge scam in CM’s name: Cybercrime issues warning Recharge scam in CM’s name: Cybercrime issues warning CHENNAI Posted on January 10, 2025 12:16 pm By NT Bureau\nA message claiming that Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin is offering a 3-month free recharge to everyone, along with an online link, is circulating on social media as a New Year announcement. Cybercrime police have issued a warning, urging people not to fall for such fraudulent advertisements. Cybercriminals, using the names of prominent organizations, lure people with enticing advertisements and send links through which they gain unauthorized access to bank accounts. Such scams have led to monetary theft from unsuspecting individuals. Recently, similar scams were reported with fake advertisements bearing Prime Minister Modi’s image, falsely promoting government schemes. Now, a fraudulent message in the name of Chief Minister Stalin is making rounds on social media platforms. The fake message reads, “New Year Recharge Offer: On the occasion of New Year, Chief Minister Stalin is providing a free 2-month recharge worth ₹749.” It includes an online link for users to claim the offer. Cybercrime police have cautioned the public that clicking on such links can lead to unauthorized access to mobile numbers and bank accounts linked to them, resulting in potential monetary theft. They have advised people to be vigilant and avoid believing or engaging with such fraudulent advertisements.
