  "text": "on 09-01-2025 8h42\nHi everyone,\nI’m experiencing an issue with my website when accessing it through BT Broadband. The website is hosted on a third-party server and typically loads fine on other ISPs and even on mobile data. However, when I access it via BT Broadband, the loading times are noticeably slower, especially for media-rich pages.\nI’ve already:\nCould there be some routing issue specific to BT's network? Would enabling BT Web Protect or Smart Setup affect the connection to my site? Has anyone faced similar issues or have any suggestions?\nThanks in advance for your help!",
