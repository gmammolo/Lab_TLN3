  "text": "on 09-01-2025 8h43\nHi,\nI’ve been experiencing intermittent drops with my BT Fibre broadband over the past few weeks. The connection will suddenly drop for 1-2 minutes and then reconnect on its own. This happens several times a day, disrupting my work and streaming.\nHere are some details:\nThe router’s lights show the connection is fine most of the time, but the drops still occur. Could this be an issue with line stability or noise on the fibre connection? Or should I request a replacement router?\nHas anyone else experienced this, and are there any solutions I can try before contacting BT support?\nThanks in advance for your help!",
