  "text": "I have just migrated from FTTC to FTTP, engineer came yesterday and connected me. The 'landline' was working fine but now dead.\nI have rung BT who say that digital voice will be reactivated when the order is complete on 27th January - 18 days time.\nWhy so long? It seems off to me to leave me without a phone line when all it needs is an activation?\nAlso not getting the speeds I have paid for - paid for 900 package - BT test for speed to the hub varies from 500-600. Stay fast guarantee promise for me on signing up was 700.\nRang BT and they said broadband won't be fully functional until the order is complete on 27th January!\nJust wanted to ask does this sound right?\nThanks!!!\nThanks - will do!\nHave you plugged the phone into the green phone socket on the rear of the Smarthub?\nHave you logged onto your Smarthub2 http://bthomehub.home/home.htm management page to see if the phone is showing there and what status it is showing?\nAs regards the poor speeds, you should be getting the full speed from day one that it went live. You will be expected to pay from that date!\nCall BT and tell them that you have a problem and do not be fobbed off.\nYes phone plugged in and status in hub settings says ‘not configured’ and I cannot click on it. Tried a few phones that were working until the switchover yesterday.",
