  "text": "Monday\nI’ve never had an issue before but now when I try to “manage sensors” the app freezes and won’t allow me to change the sensor schedule. I’ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I can manually switch from the sensor to the thermostat, but I can’t change the schedule like I could before. Is anyone else having this issue?\n38m ago\nHi @GatorGrad95!\nThanks for reaching out to the community. I am sorry to hear that the app is freezing and it is not allowing you to change the sensor schedule, but no need to worry; help is here.\nWe appreciate all of your previous troubleshooting efforts. Before continuing, I need to know a few things:\nI'll be waiting for your response; any additional details you can provide will be helpful.\nBest regards,\nJeremy.",
