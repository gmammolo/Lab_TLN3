  "text": "The iPhone 16 models, including the Pro and Pro Max, have been reported to experience significant overheating issues, with over 500 users sharing their experiences on Apple community forums and social media. Many have described excessive heat during calls and charging, while others report noticeable warmth even during light use. Such reports have sparked discussions in Apple communities, emphasizing the need for further investigation. The device gets excessively hot when charging and during regular use. After just five days, this behavior is concerning and not normal.\nUsers have reported trading in older models, like the iPhone 12 Pro, and not experiencing these issues with their previous devices. The overheating in iPhone 16 models could be linked to their advanced hardware and software capabilities, including a more powerful processor, which generates additional heat during intensive tasks. Furthermore, the new features in iOS 18 may require more power, contributing to higher device temperatures, especially during prolonged use or initial setup. For instance, one user noted that their iPhone 12 Pro never became uncomfortably hot during calls, but their iPhone 16 overheated after a 10-minute conversation, forcing them to end the call prematurely. Other users have shared similar experiences, highlighting a noticeable difference in thermal performance between the models.\nIf the phone were truly overheating to a dangerous level, it would display a thermometer warning, stating that it needs to cool down before further use. However, consistent heat issues can still be alarming, especially for a new device.\nA new iPhone often works very hard in the background during the first few days, indexing millions of bytes of data. The amount of data transferred from an old phone to the new one can influence how long this background activity lasts. During this period, performance and temperature fluctuations are common as the device settles.\nIt is important to note that some activities, such as charging or performing computationally intensive tasks (e.g., video editing or gaming), can generate heat. This is normal behavior for most smartphones and should not be cause for alarm in moderation. Apple advises keeping the iPhone, power adapter, and any wireless charger in a well-ventilated area when in use or charging. Examples of well-ventilated areas include open desks or tables away from enclosed spaces like drawers or under pillows and blankets. Avoid placing the device on heat-trapping surfaces such as couches or beds while charging.\nChanges in software, such as upgrades, may also introduce new features that increase power drain and heat generation. Checking Settings > Battery can help identify apps running in the background that consume significant power. Consider disabling features such as Background App Refresh (Settings > General > Background App Refresh) or Location Services (Settings > Privacy > Location Services) to reduce power usage.\nFor new devices, initial setup and background activities may cause temporary heat generation. It’s best to give the device a day or two to complete these tasks and then reevaluate the situation.\nTroubleshooting Fixes Avoid Intensive Usage: During the initial setup phase, refrain from heavy gaming, video editing, or other intensive activities. Check for Software Updates: Ensure the latest version of iOS is installed, as software bugs can contribute to overheating and battery problems. Update Your iPhone: Go to Settings > General > Software Update and install the latest iOS version. Updates often include fixes for bugs that could cause overheating. Reset Settings: Navigate to Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset and select “Reset All Settings.” This action will not erase data but can resolve misconfigurations . Inspect Battery Usage: Go to Settings > Battery to identify if any specific app is consuming excessive power. Consider deleting or updating problematic apps. Avoid Using the Phone While Charging: Using the phone while it’s plugged in can generate additional heat. Contact Apple Support: If overheating persists after several days, reaching out to Apple for assistance is recommended. The device may have a hardware issue requiring attention. For professional help, consider scheduling a Genius Bar appointment by following these steps:\nVisit Genius Bar Reservation and Apple Support Options – Apple . Select “ Get hardware help .” Choose the affected hardware and continue selecting options related to replacing parts until the “Bring in for Repair” option appears. Sign in with your Apple ID to complete the reservation. Alternatively, initial heat may also result from the setup phase, where the phone performs intensive indexing of data and apps. This phase should resolve in a day or two, leading to a more stable performance.\nRelated articles:",
