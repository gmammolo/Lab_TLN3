  "text": "Hi,\nIs anyone else finding an issue in Switch Career mode?\nThe screen is intermittently loading white instead of green, which makes it impossible to play as you can't see the ball!\nOnce it has done it once, it does every load - we could only stop it by simming the match.\nTotally frustrating, and no idea why it happens.\nPlease help!",
