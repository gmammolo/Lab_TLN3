  "text": "Nothing shows respect in the markets for a business leader like his comments causing a stock's price to crash nearly 50% in 24 hours. Indeed, this is precisely what happened to Rigetti Computing, Inc. (\nRigetti Computing: Huang Pops The Quantum Bubble\nSummary\n- Rigetti Computing, Inc.’s speculative valuation, with a pre-crash P/S ratio of 250, led to a nearly 50% price drop after Nvidia’s CEO highlighted quantum computing’s distant scalability (~20 years away).\n- Quantum computing's potential is revolutionary, but Rigetti's fundamentals don’t justify even a post-crash P/S of 130. Significant dilution and speculative sentiment further weaken its investment case.\n- Fair value estimate of $595M (P/S ~50) highlights a negative -69.5% margin of safety. Avoid Rigetti stock despite short-term momentum appeal; its growth timeline and financial risks remain speculative.\nAnalyst’s Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of NVDA either through stock ownership, options, or other derivatives.
