  "text": "According to Odaily, Elon Musk has been identified as a top player in Diablo IV, as reported by Fortune magazine. However, some gamers accuse him of exploiting game glitches to achieve this status. Additionally, there are claims that Musk hired a more skilled player to assist in leveling up his character in Path of Exile 2. Neither Musk nor Activision Blizzard has responded to requests for comments on these allegations. Previously, Musk tweeted about frog elements and mentioned naming his next character in Path of Exile's Hardcore mode as Kekius Maximus, which temporarily boosted the value of a [meme](/trade/MEME_USDT?contentId=18737777487089) coin with the same name.",
