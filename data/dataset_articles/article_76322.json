  "text": "Scientists have warned that volcanic eruptions due to climate change could lead to completely unexpected consequences.\nThis was reported by URA-Inform with reference to CNN.\nUniversity of Geneva professor Marcus Stoffel said Earth has a 1 in 6 chance of experiencing a powerful volcanic eruption this century, which could cause “climate chaos” for the planet. However, he also warned that “humanity has no plan for how to deal with this situation.”\n“But what will be next and when is still impossible to predict,” he said.\nStoffel recalled that in 1815 there was a powerful eruption of the Indonesian volcano Tambora . This eruption released 24 cubic miles of gas, dust and rock into the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to plummet. Due to the bad harvest, famine occurred, which led to an increase in disease and the death of tens of thousands of people.\nHowever, Stoffel warned that a 21st century megavolcano could cause further devastation, exacerbating the effects already caused by humanity’s reliance on fossil fuels , in contrast to the “year without a summer” following the Tambora eruption .\nIt will also be interesting to find out what danger tea bags pose to humans: scientists have warned about what they contain.",
