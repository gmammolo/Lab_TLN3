  "text": "Waymo Customer Speaks Out After Self-Driving Taxi Malfunction Leaves Him Trapped Going In Circles Mike Johns, a tech entrepreneur from Los Angeles , had an unexpected detour when his self-driving Waymo taxi got stuck circling a parking lot in Phoenix, Arizona.\nThe autonomous car, en route to drop him off for a flight at Phoenix’s Sky Harbor Airport , completed several loops before Johns received help to get the vehicle back on track.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by the Jasmine BRAND (@thejasminebrand)\nJohns made it to his flight despite the dizzying delay, and Waymo confirmed they refunded his fare, noting his delay was no more than 5 minutes. He later shared his frustration on social media , questioning the reliability of the technology, stating:\n“If we got to the tenth loop, do I need to jump into the driver’s seat?… What happens next? Because the car is still in control. I could bench press 300-plus, but am I able to control this?”\nThe incident adds to the list of challenges faced by self-driving cars as companies like Waymo work to refine their systems.\nAre you ready to take a chance on self-driving vehicles or do they need more work first?
