  "text": "3 weeks ago\nHi, looking to get resolution on a bricked Nest Audio.\nSome background: I came home after work on Dec 7 and found my Nest Audio unresponsive. I have a nest thermostat, home mini, and a nest hub in the same house that are working fine, only the Nest Audio was unresponsive.\nActions taken: I tried to reboot the unresponsive Nest Audio, the white dots flashed briefly, then nothing. Tried to reboot again, no response. I checked the outlet with another Google home device, and the outlet is fine. I used another power adapter that I confirmed works with other units on the affected Nest Audio, and still no response.\nOnline chat has generally been unhelpful, offering nothing else but \"product is out of warranty, buy a new one\". I was wondering if anyone here has a solution. Was there a recent update that bricked my device?\nThanks,\nAnswered!\nGo to the Recommended Answer.\na week ago\nHi @stepgie!\nThis situation needs further assistance; please fill out this form with all the necessary information, like the thread title or link and your username in the community.

As you have already tried to reset your device, we will need to follow these extra troubleshooting steps:\nTell me how it goes.\nRegards,\nJeremy.\na week ago\nHi Jeremy, I followed the directions and no LED lights came up.
