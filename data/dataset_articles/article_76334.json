  "text": "A video showing Rajat Sharma, the Editor-in-Chief of India TV News, purportedly endorsing 'quick home remedies' for diseases related to heart and blood vessels is being shared on social media.\nWhat's the truth?: This is a deepfake video.\nThe original video dates back to June 2024 and shows Sharma denying accusations made by Congress leaders against the journalist, following a debate on the channel.\n[REMOVE AD](/plan-selection?utm_source=remove_ad&utm_medium=remove_ad_button)\nHow did we find out the truth?: We performed a relevant keyword but did not find any reports where Sharma is talking about remedies linked to heart and blood vessels' diseases.\nThen we performed reverse image search on some of the keyframes of the video and this led us to a\nposton X (formerly Twitter) shared by Sharma on 11 June 2024.The attire, ticker and the background seen in this video matched with the viral clip.\nIn this video, Sharma refuses the claims made against him by Congress leaders Jairam Ramesh, Pawan Khera and Ragini Nayak.\nNayak accused Sharma of abusing her on national television during a debate on the show on the counting day of 2024 Lok Sabha polls.\nAI-Detection tools: We also checked the viral video on AI-detection tools, TrueMedia and Contrails, which concluded that this clip is a deepfake.\nTrueMediaanalysis returned with 100 percent for the audio to be AI-generated.\nContrailsAI also detected manipulation in audio and video.\nIt also showed that the video where Sharma speaks all indicates manipulation (red negative graph) and the later half of the video with no audio showed no results.\nConclusion: A deepfake video of Rajat Sharma talking about remedies linked to heart and blood diseases is going viral online.\n(Not convinced of a post or information you came across online and want it verified?
