  "text": "Most e-wallet verifications ask for a selfie to make sure your identity matches the documents you provided and prevent fraudulent activity.\nWhile it may sound harmless, an anonymous individual who claims to be an e-wallet staff member reveals that there’s more to it than meets the eye.\nFor illustration purposes only\n“Public service announcement!”\nA Facebook user recently shared a post from an anonymous person warning people to dress appropriately when sending selfies for ID verification .\nThe post, written by someone who claims to be one of the verifiers , expressed their embarrassment at having to verify users while seeing parts of their bodies .\n“If you guys want to take a selfie to submit for ID verification, please wear appropriate clothing. I feel ashamed having to witness your assets,” the person wrote.\nThe anonymous person went on to explain that it doesn’t matter if users are men or women, even if the verification only asks for a facial check. As verifiers, they allegedly can see the whole body .\n“Sure, they only ask to verify your face or head, but as verifiers, we can see your full body!”\nThe adoption of electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC)\nFor those of you who didn’t know, financial institutions in Malaysia, including e-wallets and banking applications , have been adopting electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) processes as guided by regulatory frameworks established by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM).\nWith eKYC, everything is automated and can be done remotely, which means businesses need fewer staff and less effort .\nIt makes the process faster and easier while cutting down the need for manual or in-person checks , as reported by CTOS . But despite this, it’s always better to play it safe than regret it later!\nFor illustration purposes only\nNetizens started flooding the comment section with their thoughts and reactions.\n“That’s why whenever I do any face ID, I always make sure I’m fully dressed. I don’t know, it just feels unsafe. You can say whatever you want about the robot guarding the system not seeing it, but I still don’t trust it.”\n“Next time, let us know on social media or in ads about this info or highlight it before we all do verifications.”\n“Seriously, haven’t any of you ever thought of this? Sometimes, I have to check reports on why so many verifications failed, and I get dizzy just looking at everyone’s pictures.”\n“The old method was human verifiers, but now most apps use AI, and it keeps failing. Anyway, in front of the camera, we should always wear proper clothing.”\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Let us know down in the comments!\nAlso read: PM Anwar Becomes 1st M’sian to Register for National Digital ID, Assures That The Tech is Secure\nSource: Canva Source: Facebook Source: Canva Source: Facebook Source: Facebook Source: Facebook Source: Facebook",
