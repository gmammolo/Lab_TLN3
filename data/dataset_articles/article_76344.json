  "text": "Social media users worldwide have been fooled by an AI-generated image that appears to show a massive fire engulfing a warehouse for Chinese e-commerce giant Temu. The social media user who created the image told AFP it was intended as a joke, and no official reports indicate such an incident happened as of January 7, 2025.\n\"Good thing I'm still at the add-to-cart stage,\" read Tagalog-language text overlaid on the image shared on Facebook on December 30, 2024.\nIt appears to show a big fire at a warehouse belonging to Temu, a shopping app owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings that has sucked in consumers across the world with its low prices ( archived link ).\n© AFP\nThe image spread online around the world, including in posts in English , Korean , Thai and French , with many social media users appearing to believe it showed a real inferno.\n\"Oh no what happens to my purchases?\" one commented.\n\"Gosh I buy most of my household items here,\" another wrote.\nAI-generated The picture features several clues that it was created with artificial intelligence, including a \"Grok\" watermark in the bottom right corner, which refers to the generative AI chatbot created by Elon Musk's company xAI.\nOther defects include the brand name misspelled as \"Tehu\" -- instead of \"Temu\" -- on the side of the warehouse and the inaccurate depiction of the company's official logo ( archived link ).\n© AFP\nWhile there is no foolproof method to spot AI-generated media , identifying watermarks and visual inconsistencies can help, as errors still occur despite the meteoric progress in generative AI.\n'Simply a joke' Reverse image searches on Google found an earlier upload of the image on the X account @DocAtCDI, who shared it with a humour-laden caption ( archived link ).\nIt read: \"A 57,000 square foot Temu warehouse in China went up in flames today. The total loss of inventory has been estimated to be as high as $56.19 USD.\"\nThe user confirmed to AFP on January 4 that they made the photo using AI.\n\"There is a watermark that was left in on the bottom right to make sure people would know it was AI generated, it was simply a joke,\" they said.\nThe same account has previously posted AI-generated images of a burning Temu building.\n© AFP\nFurther keyword searches on X uncovered an earlier post with a similar caption but a different AI-generated image of a burning Temu warehouse, as indicated by the appearance of a Grok watermark ( archived link ).\nFact-checking organisation Snopes noted that Irish satirical channel The Waterford Whispers News previously shared a similar version of the joke about a Temu warehouse fire in a video uploaded on September 3, 2024 (archived here and here ).\nAFP found no official reports of a Temu warehouse catching fire, as of January 7.\n<div",
