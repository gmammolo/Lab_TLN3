  "text": "- Indian AI startups raised US$747 million in 2024, with the number of deals rising from 78 to 121. The banking and financial sector was one of the top drivers of this growth\n- But this surge in AI adoption has caught the hawk-like gaze of the Reserve Bank of India, which recently set up a committee to evaluate the usage of AI in banking and financial services\n- While AI has certainly captured the attention of lenders, with Bajaj Finance—one of the top non banks—announcing plans to use AI across business segments, many concerns still remain\n- Despite the potential of AI, especially in areas like compliance and underwriting, its use in banking and finance could end up magnifying existing human biases\nEnter your email address to receive a daily summary of all our stories.\nThe days of jumping through hoops for loan approvals are nearly over.\nIndore-based couple Disha and Abhinav Sharma, for example, navigated a maze of paperwork and agent visits, including zeroing in on the down payment and interest rate, getting the property assessment by the bank, followed by processing and disbursal. They waited an entire month for their application to be approved. Today, the process is a whole lot faster.\nBengaluru-based Navanc is one such firm making it happen. The two-year-old fintech counts non-banks, small finance banks, and housing finance companies such as Muthoot Finance, Vastu Housing Finance, and APAC Financial Services among its clients. It uses AI tools to speed up property evaluations—the slowest part of the loan-approval process.\n“Financial institutions typically need approval from an empanelled service provider who visits the property and gives a red or green flag, and this process is repeated multiple times,” Byom Kesh Jha, Navanc’s co-founder, told The Ken. With AI tools, the credit manager just needs to take photographs of the property. The AI tool then analyses these images and provides updates on the progress in construction, allowing bankers to assess property quality and make more objective, data-driven decisions, added Jha.\nThe tool, in fact, lets financial institutions reduce the turnaround time for property assessment from 10 working days to less than 36 hours, said Nagachethan SM, another co-founder of the company. “Clients who use the full Navanc technology stack can reduce the cost for this process by 25%,” he added.\nAt first glance, it looks like a win-win for both the borrower and the bank—quick, hassle-free loan approvals for the applicant, and more bandwidth for the bank to handle additional applications. This is especially meaningful in smaller cities and semi-urban areas, where housing projects often lack proper legal paperwork and don’t have bank representatives stationed at developers’ offices.\nBut it’s not as straightforward as it seems. Generative AI isn’t a magical solution that cuts time and effort, and the [The Economic Times](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/rbi-governor-shaktikanta-das-has-ai-warning-for-financial-institutions-failures-or-disruptions-in-these-systems-/articleshow/114223049.cms)AI introduces new vulnerabilities: Governor Das",
