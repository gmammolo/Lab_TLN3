  "text": "Solana’s Price Decline Deepens Despite Improved Network Participation 2 mins By Aaryamann Shrivastava 10 January 2025, 08:00 GMT+0000 Updated by Harsh Notariya 10 January 2025, 07:03 GMT+0000 Join our Trading Community on Telegram Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Linkedin Share on Google News In Brief Solana’s price drops to $188 as weak inflows limit recovery despite rising investor activity and network participation. Active addresses grew by 1.5 million in 9 days, signaling optimism, but tangible support remains absent to drive price action. Breaching $201 resistance could spark recovery, while failure at $186 support risks a further drop to $175. promo\nSolana price action has seen a significant drawdown over the past three days, falling from $221 to $201.\nDespite this decline, investor sentiment remains bullish, although their optimism has not yet translated into tangible actions to support a recovery.\nSolana Needs More Support The number of active addresses on the Solana network has been steadily increasing since the beginning of the year. Over nine days, addresses conducting transactions on the network grew by 1.5 million. This rise indicates that investors are optimistic about Solana’s potential for a bounce-back and are positioning themselves to capitalize on lower prices.\nWhile the rising number of active addresses highlights a growing interest, it also emphasizes a gap between optimism and action. Many investors are still waiting for more favorable conditions before significantly increasing their participation in the network, leaving Solana in a precarious position.\nSponsored Sponsored Solana Active Addresses. Source: Glassnode The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator shows that inflows into Solana are not yet strong enough to drive substantial recovery. While investors remain optimistic, the lack of materialized inflows has limited Solana’s ability to benefit from heightened interest and rising active addresses.\nThe weak inflows underline the need for investors to make a more concerted effort to support Solana’s price action. Until these inflows strengthen, the altcoin’s bullish potential will remain unrealized, leaving it vulnerable to broader market influences and continued volatility .\nSolana CMF. Source: TradingView SOL Price Prediction: Breaching Resistance At the time of writing, Solana’s price stands at $188 after reclaiming the critical support level of $186. The altcoin is now targeting the $201 resistance level, aiming to convert it into support to set the stage for a potential recovery.\nIf inflows into Solana gain momentum, bullish activity could push the altcoin past the $201 resistance. Breaching this level would enable further recovery, likely attracting more investors and reinforcing the positive sentiment.\nSolana Price Analysis. Source: TradingView However, a failure to sustain the current support could lead to a deeper decline, with Solana potentially falling to $175. Such a move would invalidate the bullish recovery thesis and may exacerbate negative sentiment among investors.\nBest crypto platforms in Europe | January 2025 eToro Explore Coinrule Explore Uphold Explore Coinbase Explore Chain GPT Explore Best crypto platforms in Europe | January 2025 eToro Explore Coinrule Explore Uphold Explore Coinbase Explore Chain GPT Explore Best crypto platforms in Europe | January 2025 eToro Coinrule Uphold Coinbase Chain GPT Disclaimer\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.
