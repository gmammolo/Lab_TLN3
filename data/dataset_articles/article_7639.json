  "text": "WASKOM, Texas — A community came together today to remember two young brothers who lost their lives in an East Texas house fire.\nIt was an incredibly emotional day in Waskom as family, friends, and classmates said goodbye to Isaac Pedraza, 8, and his Hector Pedraza, 11. Their funeral service took place at Waskom High School.\nMore than 100 people filled the gym to pay their respects. Many people wore red and blue, the boys’ favorite colors, as a way to honor them.\nThe brothers died in a house fire on Dec. 30 at their Noble Street home. Their father was injured while trying to save them.\nBoth boys were students in Waskom ISD, and to support the grieving community, the district delayed the start of the second semester so students and staff could attend the service.\nIssac's classmate second-grader Jazzlyn Pritchett said, “He was funny and nice and she will miss him.\"\nSchool officials say counseling services will be available when classes resume tomorrow to help students and staff as they continue to grieve.",
