  "text": "Back in August 2024, we highlighted a story about a Cybertruck owner who wanted to trade in his dual-motor Cybertruck and upgrade to the performance tri-motor Cybertruck Cyberbeast.\nHowever, despite looking to give Tesla more money to upgrade to a higher trim Cybertruck, Tesla denied his trade-in offer.\nThis was surprising because Tesla accepts all trade-in vehicles from other automakers, even internal combustion cars. If people are looking to trade in their gas-guzzlers to buy a Tesla, the EV maker is more than happy to let them do so.\nHowever, when it came to the Cybertruck, Tesla said no to the company’s own product.\nAt the time, Tesla said the reason it was not accepting Cybertruck trade-ins was because the truck was too new to the market. Tesla fans also defended the company’s decision, pointing to the special purchase agreement Tesla required early Cybertruck buyers to sign.\nAccording to the agreement, Foundation Series Cybertruck buyers are barred from selling their vehicle within the first year of their purchase.\nTesla fans say it’s understandable that Tesla was not accepting Cybertruck trade-ins because of the no-resell clause.\nIronically, this same no-resell clause is why most Cybertruck buyers wanted Tesla to buy their trucks.\nHowever, Tesla’s policy seems to be that you can’t sell your truck to others, and we don’t want you to sell it back to us, either.\nAs I have mentioned above, Tesla said the reason for this policy was because the vehicle was not on the market long enough. However, as the new year started, there was a wave of optimism amongst Tesla Cybertruck owners, who believed they would finally be allowed to trade in their Cybertruck to get another Tesla.\nSurprisingly, many people looking to trade in their Cybertruck were doing so because they wanted to buy another Cybertruck.\nTesla has recently started offering free lifetime supercharger access to new Cybertruck buyers who purchase an inventory Foundation Series Cybertruck. And the individuals looking to trade in their Cybertruck already have the same Foundation Series Cybertruck but are willing to pay thousands of dollars to get access to lifetime supercharging.\nOne such individual, Jay from Scottsdale, Arizona, shared on the Cybertruck Owners Club forum that Tesla is processing his Cybertruck trade-in offer.\nJay writes…\n“Tesla Allowing Cybertruck Trade-in Towards a Cybertruck with Free SuperCharging\nI am not saying that it makes financial sense, BUT my family will road-trip the heck out of our AWD Cybertruck with free Supercharging.\nI don’t yet have a response from Tesla on the trade-in value, so there is that. I might attempt a private sale if the value offered is less than what I want.\nTL/DR: I’m eating some depreciation to get a “tactical grey” interior and free Supercharging for as long as I own it. And it looks like I’m being allowed to trade in my “old” Cybertruck with 16,000 miles.”\nBelow his post, Jay shared a screenshot from his Tesla app, which reads…\n“Trade-in Offer Pending\nWe’ll reach out to you when there is an offer ready for review\nTrade-in vehicle: 2024 Tesla Cybertruck”\nSimilarly, other Cybertruck owners shared that Tesla has accepted their 2024 Cybertruck as a trade-in vehicle and that the offer is pending.\nHowever, fast-forward a few days, and the dreams of these Cybertruck owners have been dashed. Even in 2025, Tesla still refuses to accept Cybertrucks as trade-in vehicles.\nTesla started Cybertruck deliveries in November 2023, which means a year and 2 months out; Tesla still doesn’t want any Cybertruck owners returning their trucks back to the EV maker.\nA few days after his original post, Jay updated us with his situation writing…\n“So despite being encouraged by Kevin at the Scottsdale Tesla center and allowed to upload photos for a potential trade-in, Tesla texted this morning that they will not be accepting Cybertrucks for trade-in at this time.”\nThis is disappointing since it suggests that Tesla doesn’t stand behind its products. Other Cybertruck owners with similar pending trade-in quotes confirmed that Tesla has also denied their offer.\nLooking at the comments, most people did not see the logic behind paying potentially $20,000 for free lifetime surcharging.\nEven at Tesla’s recently hiked supercharger prices, it will take tens of thousands of miles of travel to get even on the initial investment.\nHowever, at the same time, other Cybertruck owners have criticized Jay for trying to trade in his Cybertruck. They suggest he should keep this one and buy another Cybertruck with the free lifetime supercharging perk.\nA fellow Cybertruck owner, Khan from Las Vegas, writes…\n“I would never do this kind of dumb stuff...I would've just bought another Cybertruck with the free supercharging. Then you'd have the free supercharging without losing by selling the old one!”\nIf paying $20,000 for free supercharging is not a good idea, I don’t know how wise it is to buy another truck for $100,000 to get lifetime charging access.\nHowever, please let me know what you think in the comments.
