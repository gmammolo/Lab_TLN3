  "text": "I'm so glad I bought this absolute dung of a game Ea fc 25 for £20 in the Sale. You're just ripping the p**s out of the customers. The gameplay is ridiculous. I've went from playing career mode on legendary in Fc 24 and cruising to struggling and can't score on world class on 25. It is virtually impossible to pass the ball out after winning it when defending a corner. You can tell the developers are clueless clowns. Who just want to fleece the public. Already had 11 patch notes in 3 months.. They sell us a completely broken game. Then try and fix it before they rip us all off again. You can poke your game where the sun don't shine",
