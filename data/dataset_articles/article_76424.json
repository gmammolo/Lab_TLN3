One of the retail sources has leaked a feature downgrade for the\n[Galaxy S25 Ultra](https://www.phonearena.com/galaxy-s25-ultra-release-date-price-features-news).\nWhen the Note series was retired and its features were assimilated into the Galaxy S Ultra, the model also gained support for the S Pen stylus. The S Pen features Bluetooth connectivity, which allows for additional features that non-Bluetooth styluses can't support.\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra may come with a less capable S Pen. | Image Credit - Ishan Agarwal, X\nThe S Pen is one of the most powerful features of Galaxy S Ultra phones and sets the devices apart from other\n[top phones](https://www.phonearena.com/news/Best-top-phones_id64576). Power users will likely be annoyed at the downgrade, though most people may use the stylus for nothing more than writing and scribbling, which are tasks that can be performed by a non-Bluetooth S Pen as well.\nOne upside to not having Bluetooth connectivity is that a non-Bluetooth S Pen will not have to be charged separately as it will draw power from the device.\nRegardless, no one likes losing features, and if this leak materializes, it's not going to go down well with people who stick with the Ultra due to its productivity-oriented features.\nThe\n[other rumored features](https://www.phonearena.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-more-information-revealed-ahead-of-unpacked-event_id166438)might be compelling enough for people to overlook the less capable S Pen. For starters, the\n[phone is expected to be around 40 percent faster](https://www.phonearena.com/news/Impressive-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-performance-gains-revealed-by-leaker_id166451)than its predecessor. It's also likely to feature a bigger vapor chamber, which will ensure it doesn't get warm. It's also rumored to get a new ultrawide camera and\n[low-light video updates](https://www.phonearena.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-video-upgrades_id166441). Most importantly, it's rumored to flaunt a new design.\nLoading Comments...",
