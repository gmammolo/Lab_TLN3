  "text": "NVIDIA also opposed restrictions from the Biden administration on the export of AI chips, with such a decision bound to harm the US economy as well as position itself globally. A market leader in AI chip products, NVIDIA went further arguing that the action would prove ineffective towards bolstering national security and drive other countries towards developing alternative technologies.\nSuch a proposal would supposedly set ceilings on US-produced semiconductor sales and export controls against those like China and Russia. In fact, this aims to cut access of those adversaries to superior technologies; but the argument comes from NVIDIA, one of those giants, who states that it can only mean discouraging further research, leading, eventually, to ceding shares to their global competitors.\nNVIDIA Criticizes Restricting Mainstream AI Chips\nNed Finkle, vice president of government affairs at NVIDIA, condemned the focus on mainstream AI chips, which are found in gaming PCs and data centers, as misguided. He argued that the country caps would interrupt the availability of essential computing technologies around the world without significantly advancing national security.”.\nThe new policy, which is said to be rolled out in the near future, intends to place a tiered structure on semiconductor exports. For US allies, full access would remain, but most other countries are expected to face new constraints, including specific caps on the amount of computing power allowed to be exported to them.\nFinkle warned that the “last-minute” policy of the Biden administration may be harmful to US businesses and may also damage international relationships. He advised Biden not to act on impulse, and that the incoming Trump administration might take a more business-friendly approach that would be good for companies like NVIDIA.\nNVIDIA’s CEO, Jensen Huang, indicated a willingness to work with the incoming Trump administration, suggesting that reduced regulation under Trump could spur innovation. Huang emphasized that Trump’s approach could help accelerate the tech industry’s growth and ensure a more favorable environment for companies like NVIDIA, which have benefited from the AI boom.\nWidespread Industry Pushback\nOther major tech companies, such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta, share NVIDIA’s concerns. These companies, represented by the Information Technology Industry Council, argue that the proposed export restrictions would limit their ability to compete globally, potentially isolating the US tech sector and weakening its competitive edge.\nBiden’s Policy on National Security and AI\nWhile the Biden administration maintains that the export restrictions are aimed at preventing China from using AI to enhance its military capabilities, critics argue that the policy risks undermining US competitiveness. Many argue that it could prompt other nations to adopt alternative technologies, potentially reducing the global market share for US tech companies.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the incoming administration and the proposed restrictions make the tech industry ready for possible changes in regulation and trade policy. NVIDIA, like its peers, is calling for a more balanced approach that would balance national security concerns with the need to remain globally competitive.",
