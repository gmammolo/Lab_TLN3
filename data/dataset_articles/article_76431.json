  "text": "Visa Delays Impact Chinese Exhibitors at CES, Underscoring Struggles for International Business Events\nSkift Take\nCES is in full swing in Las Vegas, and there have been reports of some Chinese exhibitors being denied U.S. visas to attend.\nAccording to South China Morning Post, some 1,300 Chinese companies are exhibiting at CES, based on a list at the event’s website, less than the record 1,551 Chinese exhibitors in 2018.\nThe Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which owns and produces CES, wouldn’t confirm the number of exhibitors from China: “We don’t provide country-specific exhibitor breakdowns,” it said. A CES spokesperson went on to say, “While we do not have any influence over the visa process, CTA encourages the U.S. government to expedite and approve visas for individuals who are traveling to the U.S. for legitimate business reasons.”\nTori Emerson Barnes, U.S. Travel Association executive vice president, public affairs and policy, said the visa challenges that some CES exhibitors faced is “disappointing and costly.”\n“Global travelers are paramount to our economic success. As a nation, we should be welcoming an increasing number of international visitors for business, exhibitions, and trade events, as well as leisure travel,” said Barnes.\nThe State Department has made some progress, she said. But there is still much work to be done. “The Trump administration has a huge opportunity with a decade of mega-events ahead to get this right, reduce visa wait times, improve our visitor visa system, and, ultimately, welcome millions of new travelers to the U.S,” said Barnes.\nThe Bureau of Consular Affairs emphasized the significant economic role of Chinese visitors. It also reaffirmed its commitment to welcoming business travelers.\nVisa applications are evaluated case-by-case by consular officers, it said, who determine whether the applicant is eligible for that visa based on U.S. law.\n“We urge the PRC government to end its hiring freeze of local staff in Beijing so that we can continue to keep appointment wait times low,” said a department spokesperson.\nConsultants Help Navigate the Visa Process\nChris Pereira, founder and CEO of Impact, a global consulting company, held a training program last autumn for Chinese companies planning to attend CES. Half of the participants had issues obtaining U.S. visas. All those who reapplied were eventually successful in securing their visas.\n“However, some companies were denied initially and decided not to reapply, which unfortunately led to their absence at the event,” he said.\nOrganizers should offer step-by-step guidance on visa application procedures and encourage persistence in the event of a refusal. “This can significantly reduce the risk of nonattendance,” said Pereira. “Additionally, trade show organizers could advocate for more streamlined processes for business-focused visa applications, emphasizing the economic value these exhibitors bring to U.S. events and local economies.”\nCES Isn’t the Only Event Impacted\nVisa challenges for Chinese tech workers are widespread and are impacting more than just CES. Anjia Nicolaidis, international marketing strategist of mdg, a Freeman company, and her team have been helping exhibition clients.\n“There are many moving parts as we head into 2025 from a geopolitical standpoint,” said Nicolaidis. “We anticipate we will see more shows, especially in tech, biotech, and advanced manufacturing being impacted especially if they include a high concentration of Chinese exhibitors.”\nExploring Solutions\nWhat can event professionals do? “Increase the line of communication on the importance of applying for visas early which must be part of one’s standard operating procedure,” said Nicolaidis.\nThere are ways to maneuver visa risk issues. If the company has a subsidiary in the market where the show is held, staff from there can attend.\nIn addition, apply for visas as early as possible. Organizers must also be ready to support applications with invitations and confirmation of attendance letters.\nDestinations also have a role to play. They usually have opportunities to expedite visa applications for key attendees by activating government channels.\nVisas Are a Global Issue\nThis is not just a U.S. issue, said Kai Hattendorf, the former CEO of UFI. “For example, organizers in Germany, another of the three largest global expo markets, face similar challenges with exhibitors from many countries not getting visa interviews on time. AUMA, (Association of the German Trade Fair Industry) is pushing the issue of a digitized visa process in the current election campaign.”\nJochen Witt, president and CEO of JWC, agrees. “The visa process is often too lengthy and leads to the cancellation of trips of Chinese exhibitors and visitors to shows in Germany. In my view, the reason for this does not lie on the Chinese side, but rather on the side of the foreign embassies in China which seem not to have the manpower to process visa applications in due time,” said Witt.\nIronically, Vinnie Polito, CEO of the Society of Independent Show Organizers (SISO), was in China attending the China Expo Forum for International Cooperation (CEFCO) in Tianjin when Skift Meetings reached out to him. Visas is one of the issues on the agenda. “I do think we can manage it better and alleviate some of the bigger challenges,” Polito said.\nHe was joined in China by Marsha Flanagan, president and CEO of the International Association of Exhibitions and Events (IAEE). Flanagan, also a co-president of the Exhibitions and Conferences Alliance (ECA), said one of ECA’s 2025 public policy agenda items is reducing visa wait times while modernizing the visa processing system.",
