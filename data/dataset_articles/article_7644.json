  "text": "Family of teenage crash victim from Rotherham mistakenly identified suffered the 'unimaginable'\nLast updated 2 minutes ago\nThe family of a teenager who died in a car crash in Rotherham but was mistakenly identified as another boy have said they have been through an \"unimaginable\" ordeal.\n18-year-old Joshua Johnson died after the incident on Todwick Road - but South Yorkshire Police had identified him as another teenager.\nPolice say they are committed to understanding how it happened and making sure it doesn't happen again.\nJoshua Johnson's family said:\n“Josh was our first born – a loveable, gentle giant.\n“Whilst he was 18 and exploring his independence, he was ever so genuine in his care for others – us, his brother, his grandparents, his extended family, and his many friends.\n“Many of our happiest family memories were made whilst stock car racing. As new parents, we took Josh to his first stock car meeting at just six-weeks-old and he’s had a passion for this ever since. Through stock car racing, we’ve built a massive circle of friends and we are so very thankful for the support they and others have shown us in the last few weeks and days.\n“We will treasure our holidays as a family and with friends – we explored the world together and this was something that Josh loved.\n“What we have been through and are continuing to go through is unimaginable. From the moment we were told about the collision in December, ourselves and many loved ones have spent hours in hospital with who we now know to be Trevor. We never wanted him to be alone. Only those we shared this time with could understand how this went on for so long.\n“Neither us nor Josh’s brother can imagine life without him, and as we adjust to this new world and only just begin our journey with grief, we ask that our privacy is respected.”",
