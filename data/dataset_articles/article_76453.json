  "text": "Secondary Menu Home News World Property Tech Sports Weather A slice of Gasant Abarder What’s On Things to do Restaurants Shopping Nightlife Travel Winelands Outdoor Family & Kids Competitions Insurance Quote TikTok could shut down in the US: Supreme Court weighs decision Published by Aiden Daries on January 10, 2025 The fate of TikTok in the United States is now in the hands of the Supreme Court, as justices hear arguments Friday about whether the popular social media app should be banned due to national security concerns, Cape {town} Etc reports.\nThe legal battle pits free speech against national security, with millions of Americans, including content creators, anxiously awaiting a ruling that could impact their livelihoods and the future of the platform.\nTikTok, which has more than 170 million users in the U.S., could face a forced shutdown as early as 19 January unless the Supreme Court intervenes. A law passed by Congress earlier this year mandates the sale of the app’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, over fears of Chinese government influence. The Biden administration argues that TikTok’s ownership poses a serious threat, potentially allowing the Chinese government access to American users’ data or to manipulate the platform for propaganda. However, TikTok maintains that there is no evidence of such activity.\nThe high stakes of the case are emphasised by the potential impact on free speech. TikTok’s legal team, along with content creators, argue that the law infringes on First Amendment rights, making it one of the most significant free speech cases in modern history. Users could lose access to the platform entirely or be unable to download updates if the law takes effect, with a potential shutdown looming in the midst of a presidential transition.\nThe case has also garnered attention from former President Donald Trump, who has urged the Court to delay the law’s enforcement, suggesting a ‘political resolution’ could address national security concerns without resorting to a ban. The justices are expected to make their ruling soon, and the outcome will determine whether TikTok can continue to operate in the U.S. or if millions of users will face the sudden loss of one of their favourite digital platforms.\nAlso read:\n2025 Golden Globes winners and key moments\nPicture: Pexels",
