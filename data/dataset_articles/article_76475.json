  "text": "With Season 1 of Marvel Rivals launching today the devs explained that upcoming seasons probably won’t have that much new content.\nWhile the “first” Season of Marvel’s MMO-shooter comes filled with plenty of new content, the devs confirmed that further seasons will not be that packed.\nMarvel Rivals’ launch of Season 1 introduced multiple new characters, maps and much, much more for their hit shooter.\nHowever, NetEase, developer of the game, already explained that upcoming seasons won’t include the same amount of content as Season 1 does.\nIn a new video from January 7, Creative Director Guangguang and Lead Combat Designer Zhiyong not only gave us a more detailed view on what to expect from this new season, but also admitted that this is double the amount of content further seasons will have.\nTelling fans to see Season 1 as a “two-in-one”, Guangguang said:\nDuring our brainstorming sessions, we unanimously agreed that bringing them into Marvel Rivals in one giant-sized season was the way to go.\nWith 5 new heroes, new game modes and more content coming with Season 1 it is more than understandable that upcoming seasons can’t feature this much new content.\nAre you already playing Marvel Rivals Season 1? What are you expecting from upcoming seasons?",
