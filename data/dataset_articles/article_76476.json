  "text": "Cybersecurity will be one of the most pressing challenges for the trucking industry in 2025, according to the latest National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) trucking cybersecurity trends report .\nThe association says that as artificial intelligence (AI)- powered phishing campaigns grow more advanced, cyber-enabled cargo theft becomes increasingly sophisticated, and machine learning (ML)-based defence systems evolve rapidly, businesses will need to focus on enhanced detection and response tools and ongoing cybersecurity training for employees.\n(Photo: iStock) The report highlights several trends set to reshape the trucking sector’s cybersecurity priorities. Among them are the growing efficiency of phishing attacks, increased adoption of zero-trust architecture, and growing threats to assets and internet of things (IoT) devices.\n“Known threat actors are becoming more adept at exploiting vulnerabilities faster and more intelligently than ever before, which has empowered cybercriminals with the opportunity to leverage advanced tools that make phishing, malware creation, and impersonation scams harder to detect and prevent,” said Artie Crawford, director of cybersecurity for NMFTA, in a related news release.\nAI, phishing threats dominate While phishing is not a new technique, it remains one of the most successful methods criminals use to gain initial access to organizations. Such attacks are expected to become more efficient and accurate next year, with advancements in AI enabling threat actors to craft increasingly sophisticated and believable campaigns, NMFTA warns, adding that traditional detection methods will likely be less effective as cybercriminals use tools that bypass secure email gateways and other email security technologies.\nThe delayed phishing techniques — where malicious content is programmed to activate after bypassing the detection systems — are also anticipated to become more prevalent, posing new challenges for fleet operators.\nCargo theft, IoT threats on the rise The trucking sector is also being urged to prepare for a rise in cyber-enabled cargo theft. Thieves leverage AI tools such as large language models and malicious links to carry out phishing and credential theft schemes. The report says these tools make it easier to modify bills of lading, enabling pilfering with minimal effort. Techniques like website poisoning and lookalike domains are expected to further worsen strategic cargo theft.\n(Photo: iStock) At the same time, the continued adoption of IoT devices, particularly on trailers, poses additional vulnerabilities. In 2025, fleets will be advised to observe and apply best practices from the world of industrial control systems by sourcing and deploying products with good cyber security controls baked into their design. Such industry pressure is expected to push OEMs toward greater transparency and a stronger focus on cybersecurity.\nData privacy is another area where trucking companies will face pressures. The North American trucking industry will need to be aware of the changing privacy landscape and the ways that regulations may differ between states, as well as between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. There are already differing privacy regulations that have become law in multiple U.S. states, requiring careful handling of customer and employee data to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations. Additional regulations are anticipated in 2025, NMFTA says, adding that adhering to the highest common denominator in privacy regulation will be key to ensuring compliance.\nZero-trust architecture, API security The report also emphasizes that the adoption of zero-trust architecture will be crucial to defend businesses against the emerging threats. This approach assumes that threats can originate both externally and internally, and all users and devices are continuously verified.\nApplication programming interface (API) security also continues to be a top area of focus looking ahead to 2025. APIs play an integral role in trucking operations, connecting systems and devices, but they are also a frequent target for cyberattacks. However, advancements in AI and ML are enhancing the tools available to protect these systems.",
