  "text": "[Pokémon GO to discontinue support on 32-bit Android devices](/contents/44411-pokemon-go-to-discontinue-support-on-32-bit-android-devices)\nParanoid, Android?\nIn an upcoming update to Pokémon GO, Niantic is ending support for 32-bit Android devices. Niantic says that by doing this, the devs are able to streamline their development process and focus resources on supporting newer operating systems and technologies. Users on 64-bit Android devices and iOS users are not affected and don’t need to take any action.\nSupport for affected devices will end in phases starting March 2025, with Android devices that downloaded Pokémon GO from the Samsung Galaxy Store. Support on 32-bit Android devices for those that downloaded Pokémon GO from the Google Play Store will end in June 2025.\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of 32-bit Android devices:\n- Samsung Galaxy S4, S5, Note 3, J3\n- Sony Xperia Z2, Z3\n- Motorola Moto G (1st generation)\n- LG Fortune, Tribute\n- OnePlus One\n- HTC One (M8)\n- ZTE Overture 3\n- Certain Android devices released before 2015\nTrainers using affected devices will no longer be able to access their Pokémon GO accounts (including their PokéCoins and items) from those devices once the update is live. If you are using a 32-bit Android device, you will need a compatible 64-bit Android device or iOS device to continue playing Pokémon GO. Before you upgrade, make sure to save your account’s log-in information somewhere so you can log back in on your new device.\nTo learn more about this update and to view a more comprehensive list of affected devices, visit the Niantic help center.",
