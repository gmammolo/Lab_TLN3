  "text": "Home to a private two-bedroom apartment from Monocle, as well as a further seven minimalist guest rooms with shared facilities, Gasthof Oxen is a historic inn and restaurant blending five centuries of heritage with contemporary charm.\nA new member for ‘The Aficionados,’ the the noted beacon of hospitality has undergone a thoughtful renovation that today offers locals, creatives, and discerning global travellers a hub for short and longer term stays alongside dining and socialising in refined surroundings, this Swiss gem is set to write a new chapter in its long history.\nLocated in Küsnacht on Lake Zurich’s iconic Gold Coast, the transformation of Gasthof Oxen was led by a visionary team of industry leaders including Monocle founder Tyler Brûlé and design experts from Winkreative. Fusing tradition and modernity, their work has retained the property’s historical essence while instilling curated, modern touches.\nAlongside the inn’s accommodations is a boutique, café, and a restaurant helmed by chef Nicolas Hildebrandt that serves up regional dishes with locally sourced ingredients including daily game specialties in collaboration with hunters from the surrounding area.\nThe heart of the transformation is without a doubt the Monocle Suite, featuring mid-century furniture and bespoke interiors. Perfect for weekend getaways or retreats, it boasts spacious living areas, a fully equipped kitchen, and astonishing views of Küsnacht and Lake Zurich.\nA a cornerstone of the area’s social and cultural scene, the inn serves as a gathering place for residents and visitors who — whether whether staying overnight, dining at the restaurant or attending events in the OXENsaal — will find a contemporary retreat in what is referred to locally as the “Hamptons of Zurich.”",
