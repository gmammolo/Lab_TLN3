  "text": "SINGAPORE — China emitted 13 billion metric tons of climate-warming greenhouse gases in 2021, up 4.3 per cent from a year earlier, it said in its latest official submission to the United Nations, published by state media on Friday (Jan 10).The figure is the latest official calculation of annual greenhouse emissions by China, by far the world's biggest carbon polluter. The last official estimate covered 2017 and measured total emissions at 11.55 billion tons.As a signatory to the Paris Agreement, China is now obliged to submit detailed emissions numbers every two years, as well as progress reports on climate change adaptation and mitigation.",
