  "text": "Santiment just posted an interesting report on X about wallet holders situation for top cryptos: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, DOGE, ADA, and LINK. The data reveals that most top digital assets are experiencing growth in their holder base, with Ethereum leading the pack in absolute numbers.\nThe report shows Ethereum has added an impressive 645,000 new wallets to its network, representing a 0.5% increase since the start of 2025. Bitcoin follows with 102,000 new wallets, while [XRP has grown ](https://captainaltcoin.com/is-xrp-price-set-for-a-500-rally-crypto-expert-breaks-it-down/)its holder base by 58,000 wallets, marking a 1.0% increase.\nDogecoin continues to maintain its community growth with 29,000 new wallets, while [Cardano shows modest but steady progress](https://captainaltcoin.com/cardano-whales-massively-selling-ada-price-crash-incoming/) with 2,800 new holders, translating to a 0.1% increase. However, not all major cryptocurrencies are seeing positive numbers. Chainlink stands out as an exception, experiencing a decline of 3,300 wallets, equivalent to a 0.5% decrease in its holder base.\nThese wallet trends often reflect investor sentiment and long-term confidence in these projects. The growth in wallet numbers for most major cryptocurrencies suggests sustained interest from market participants, while Chainlink’s decrease might indicate temporary uncertainty among its holders. However, Santiment notes “there may be some excess FUD that indicates an opportunity to buy (as a contrarian to the panicking crowd).”\nThe contrast between Ethereum’s substantial wallet growth and Cardano’s smaller increase provides interesting insights into the current state of various blockchain networks. While percentage changes help understand relative growth, the absolute numbers reveal the true scale of adoption across different platforms.\nFor contrarian investors, Chainlink’s current situation might be particularly interesting. While some holders are reducing their positions, historically, such periods of decreased holder confidence have sometimes presented opportunities for those who take a counter-position to market sentiment. However, as with any market movement, these trends should be considered alongside other fundamental and technical factors.\nRead also: [Expert Reveals 2 Entry Points for XRP, Predicts Price Surge to $10](https://captainaltcoin.com/expert-reveals-2-entry-points-for-xrp-predicts-price-surge-to-10/)\nFollow us on [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/CaptainAltcoin_), [CoinMarketCap ](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/CaptainAltcoin/)and [Binance Square](https://www.binance.com/en/square/profile/captainaltcoin) for more daily crypto updates.\nGet all our future calls by joining our [FREE Telegram group.](https://t.me/captainaltcoincom)\n[\nWe recommend eToro\n](https://captainaltcoin.com/go/etoro/)\n[Take 2 mins to learn more](https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/terms-conditions/trading-restriction/)\nWide range of assets: cryptocurrencies alongside other investment products such as stocks and ETFs.\nCopy trading: allows users to copy the trades of leading traders, for free.\nUser-friendly: eToro’s web-based platform and mobile app are user-friendly and easy to navigate.",
