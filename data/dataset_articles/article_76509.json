  "text": "Experts say this strange-looking, spiky creature that resembles a miniature dragon will bring disaster to whoever keeps it.\nThe man discovered a small creature with a body full of spines, which looked exactly like a small dragon on the rock. It is known that this is one of the strangest animals of the rocky plains of South Africa .\nFound in the crevices of the Succulent Karoo, the armadillo lizard (Ouroborus cataphractus) is a creature whose appearance is distinctive and adorable.\nThis lizard is a small reptile and has a variety of colors from brown to light brown yellow. However, their most unique feature is their spiky skin.\nArmadillo lizards are covered in sharp spines, except for the lower part of the abdomen. This makes the lizard’s underside vulnerable to damage by predators.\nBecause of this weakness, this strange animal has developed an equally different form of defense: curling up into a ball when threatened, revealing only the outside like an armored car.\nArmadillo lizards cower when attacked by natural enemies such as birds, snakes and mongooses. If necessary, they can remain in this position for up to an hour.\nThe Armadillo lizard is one of the few lizards that does not lay eggs and only gives birth to one or two young per year. Another feature of this strange creature is its general habitat.\nThey are social animals and therefore prefer to live and protect each other in large groups. However, the biggest threat to this lizard is humans.\nThe reptile’s small size, distinct appearance and calm behavior have made it a popular item on the pet market, especially on black markets, although trading in this lizard is considered illegal.\nA group of wildlife traders have been arrested for illegally possessing and transporting 48 armadillo lizards. The criminals were sentenced to 1 million South African Rand (equivalent to $70,000) or 13 years in prison.\nTheir food is small desert insects such as ants or termites. Because armadillo lizards move very slowly and are hunted as pets, their numbers are seriously threatened.\nThey have currently been classified as a vulnerable population by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ).",
