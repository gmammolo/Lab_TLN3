  "text": "A gas leak at Taconic Plastics in Petersburgh prompted an hourslong evacuation of a half-mile radius around the plant.\nOfficials say it started Wednesday morning when Taconic Plastics called 911 to report the leak. First responders were offloading two 30,000-gallon tanks of propane and were trying to bring in bigger hoses to get the propane out of the area quicker. The Petersburgh fire department announced the evacuation order was lifted at around 5 p.m. Wednesday.\n\"We're just hoping it's just a bad pipe or something just broke through,\" said Rensselaer County Director of Public Safety Jay Wilson. \"We want to get this company up and running because it's one of the premier organizations in Rensselaer County operating here, and we want to get them back up and running. They got contractors here ready to go; it's just getting this propane out of the tanks, get it out of here safely, and that's why we evacuated people.\"",
