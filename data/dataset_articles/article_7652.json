  "text": "By WHIO Staff ,\n11 minutes ago A bicyclist was seriously injured after being hit by a car at a busy intersection on Wednesday night.\n[DOWNLOAD: Free WHIO-TV News app for alerts as news breaks ]\nAs previously reported by News Center 7 , the crash happened around 6:30 p.m. at Needmore Road and N. Dixie Drive in Harrison Township.\nWhen deputies arrived, they found a man in his mid-30s who had been hit by a vehicle while crossing the intersection with his bike.\nHe was unresponsive, and his injuries are considered non-life-threatening, according to the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office.\nThe driver was not injured.\nTRENDING STORIES:\n>> PREVIOUS COVERAGE: At least 1 hospitalized after crash at busy intersection in Montgomery County\nOur news crew saw a damaged bicycle in one of the crosswalks, and investigators were taking photos of a white Cadillac.\nAs reported on News Center 7 at 11:00 , the intersection was scattered with evidence markers and blocked with crime scene tape for hours.\nSeveral neighbors told News Center 7 that this intersection can be dangerous.\n“Last week, we were driving home, and there was another incident right here,” Wiltaveuh Grossley said.\nGrossley grew up in Harrison Township.\nShe was on her way home from work when she came up on this crash.\n“And all of a sudden, like all the police are pulling up, I’m like, oh my God, what’s going on? And there’s a bike in the middle of the roadway, and then there’s a car, you know,” she said. “It’s been very hectic, like this has been like the fifth accident in a couple of weeks.”\nShe added that drivers speed through this intersection often.\n“No one uses the walkway,” Grossley said.\nNews Center 7’s Taylor Robertson saw it herself.\nSeveral people ran across the street, dodging cars.\nGrossley said when people do that at night, it’s hard to see them.\n“And the fact that it’s getting dark at 5 o’clock now,” she said. “I just wish everyone would just slow down and pay attention. It’s a very high-traffic area. Kids walk around here all the time. I wish that we would use the crosswalks; there are crosswalks everywhere.”\nNews Center 7 will continue to follow this story.\n[SIGN UP: WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter ]",
