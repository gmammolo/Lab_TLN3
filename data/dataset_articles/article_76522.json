  "text": "2024 was the worst ever for commercial cyber attacks in the UK, new research suggests, with remote IoT devices attracting the most attacks.\nDuring 2024, UK firms each experienced an average of more than 753,341 malicious attempts to breach their online and IT systems , according to analysis by specialist business ISP Beaming.\nThat was 4% higher than in 2023 - itself a record year - making last year the worst ever for attempted cyber attacks, with businesses encountering a new online threat every 42 seconds.\nBefore 2024, the average number of attacks in a single quarter had only exceeded 2,000 in Q4 2023.\n\"The rise of automated cyber attacks means the internet has never been more dangerous, and we expect it will become even more so as hackers use AI ,\" said Beaming managing director Sonia Blizzard.\n\"The good news is that we are not seeing record numbers of companies crippled by hackers because businesses have got better at protecting themselves.\"\nThe most frequent targets last year were remotely-controlled IoT devices, with more than 161 daily attacks targeting applications such as building control systems, security cameras, networked printers, remote monitoring , and industrial automation systems.",
