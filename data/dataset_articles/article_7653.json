  "text": "Hyderabad: A birthday celebration ended in tragedy early on Thursday when a speeding car crashed into a roadside tree near Mirzaguda in Chevella, killing four college students and leaving one injured.\nAbout The Incident\nAccording to police, the incident occurred around 1.30 am under Mokila police station limits, when the group was returning from a friend's birthday party.\nPreliminary investigation suggests that overspeeding was the cause of the accident.\nThe victims, four of whom were BBA students and another an engineering student, included the young man whose birthday they had just gathered to celebrate.\n\"Five students aged 18 to 21 were in the vehicle travelling at a high speed. The driver lost control of the car and hit a tree, resulting in the death of four,\" an official said.\nThe impact was so severe that the car split into two, police said, adding a girl student survived the crash and is undergoing treatment at a hospital.\n(Except for the headline, this article has not been edited by FPJ's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)",
