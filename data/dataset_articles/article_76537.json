  "text": "US regulators are probing Tesla’s smart remote driving system after its ‘Actually Smart Summon’ feature fails to detect obstacles. Is your Tesla actually that smart? US safety regulators are taking a closer look at a controversial feature that lets drivers summon their parked Teslas – without even being in the car. But it seems the tech isn’t as clever as promised, with reports of several accidents linked to this supposed ‘driverless’ feature.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched a probe into Tesla’s ‘Actually Smart Summon’ technology, after a series of crashes revealed the system’s inability to detect obstacles like parked cars and posts. The issue has triggered a full-scale investigation into the safety of a feature available on 2.6 million vehicles since 2016, including the Model S, Model 3, and the Model X and Y SUVs.\nHow ‘Actually Smart’ is the Tesla summoning feature? The tech allows drivers to move their cars with the tap of a phone, but Tesla’s ambitious self-driving dreams may be getting tangled up in reality. At least four incidents have been reported in which cars went rogue while in ‘Actually Smart Summon’ mode. Fortunately, no one was injured, but the accidents have still raised serious concerns. NHTSA is also investigating its predecessor, ‘Smart Summon ‘, after a further dozen incidents were flagged.\nTesla, meanwhile, is staying quiet. As always, boss Elon Musk is behind the wheel, promoting self-driving as the future of transport. He’s always been outspoken about the technology being safer than regular driving – but does this latest investigation throw cold water on those claims?\nThe Tesla probe: A step toward a potential recall in the US and the UK and EU? The feature was designed by Tesla for use in private areas like driveways, not on public roads. Tesla’s own manual even warns that drivers need a clear line of sight between themselves and their car. But, with self-driving tech becoming more mainstream, it raises questions about how prepared these cars are for real-world challenges.\nThis probe could lead to a recall in the US and could potentially even trigger further investigations in Europe and the UK, adding to Tesla’s growing pile of scrutiny. The NHTSA will be looking into how fast the vehicles can go while in summon mode, and whether restrictions should be tightened to avoid accidents. Are regulators gearing up to putting the brakes on Musk’s ambitious autopilot dreams?\nStay tuned for more.\nRead more US news .\nRead more news in English from around Spain .\nRead more news in English from around Europe .\nTags: , , , , Share this story\nSign up for personalised news Subscribe to our Euro Weekly News alerts to get the latest stories into your inbox!\nDaily Weekly By signing up, you will create a Euro Weekly News account if you don't already have one.
