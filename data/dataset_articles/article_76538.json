  "text": "In the gold, as you know as we pulled back here, I've been telling you all week that the market should fight a battle at the 18-week average of closes for direction, and it did. And so far now, we are up about one and a half percent for the week. The market took off today, a thin volume day, but the market moved to the upside again. You have had a pattern of higher lows, higher highs - bullish. What else? The market has been fighting a battle between, and it began back here, where it started fighting at the green line. The 100-day average in the 18 back and forth, and it resolved itself to the upside.\nAnd now, the question is, does the market add to that and run off the important jobs report? Does it back off from it? But at this point in time, until you get back under here, the bulls have grabbed control of the market. They've had control. And back on Tuesday, they put themselves back over both averages and it hasn't given up the momentum since then. You are overbought into the resistance, in an uptrend.",
