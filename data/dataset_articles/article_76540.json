  "text": "Jan 10, 2025\nNASA announced that astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will remain aboard the International Space Station (ISS) until at least late March 2025 due to a delay in launching their replacements.\nImage Source: Agencies\nThe SpaceX Crew-9 mission, including Williams, Wilmore, Nick Hague, and Aleksandr Gorbunov, will return after the Crew-10 team reaches the ISS, ensuring a smooth crew transition.\nImage Source: Agencies\nIn August, NASA had indicated a February 2025 return for the two astronauts. However, this timeline has been pushed back due to delays in launching the next crew.\nImage Source: Agencies\nThe postponement stems from SpaceX needing additional time to prepare a new capsule for the next crew, shifting their launch to no earlier than late March 2025.\nImage Source: Agencies\nNASA prefers overlapping crews at the ISS to ensure seamless operations. The delay maintains this policy, despite extending Crew-9’s mission.\nImage Source: Agencies\nWilmore and Williams initially arrived at the ISS in June 2024 aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, intending to stay for a short eight-day mission that later extended into a longer deployment.\nImage Source: Agencies\nNASA considered using a different SpaceX capsule for the Crew-10 launch but opted to wait for the new capsule to avoid operational risks.\nImage Source: Agencies\nNASA confirmed the ISS is well-stocked with essentials, including food, water, clothing, and oxygen, thanks to two resupply missions completed in November 2024.\nImage Source: Agencies\nThe resupply missions also included special items for the crew to celebrate the holidays, ensuring their well-being during the extended mission.\nImage Source: Agencies\nThanks For Reading!\nRead Next",
