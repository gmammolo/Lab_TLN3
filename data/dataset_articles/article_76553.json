  "text": "Earthquakes that occurred near an oil extraction site in Surrey, UK, in 2018 and 2019 had been put down to coincidence, but a new analysis with an updated look at the geology of the area suggests the seismic events may indeed have been linked to drilling The Horse Hill oil site was discovered in 2015 Invicta Kent Media/Shutterstock\nOver 100 earthquakes that shook the south of England are likely to have been triggered by oil extraction, say experts. Previous research had ruled out a link, but fresh information about the geology of the area has established a probable connection.\nThe earthquakes were all fairly minor, measuring between 1.34 and 3.18 on the Richter scale, and took place near Newdigate in Surrey in 2018 and 2019. Residents reported their houses shaking for several seconds.\nAdvertisement\nThere was speculation at the time that the earthquakes were linked to oil extraction by UK Oil & Gas, although the epicentre of the earthquakes was between 5 kilometres and 10 kilometres from the company's Horse Hill drilling site. But previous research by the British Geological Survey (BGS) and others determined that the earthquakes, while rare and relatively near to the drilling, were natural and coincidental.\nNow, Matthew Fox and Philip Meredith at University College London have taken another look, using the latest understanding of the rock makeup of the area, and suggest that the earthquakes were indeed induced by oil extraction.\nThe pair ran more than a million computer simulations based on the…\nMatthew Sparkes",
