  "text": "For queries about your TalkTalk broadband service.\nMonday\nHaven’t had broadband since Thursday, apparently Openreach are supposed to be working on it, very little customer communication apart from a text. Shambles.\n34 minutes ago\nyesterday\nHi Debbie, thanks for the update and your continued support, we are still down. Fingers crossed for tomorrow.\nyesterday\nHi @PaulD02\nI have spoken to Openreach this morning and they have provided the following update:\nI have checked and this line is impacting with a major service outage and that's why this fault is associated with an incident. Main issue is faulty DP (Distribution point) and the team are already working on this and provided targeted fix date is showing for 09-01-2025. Please review back on 10/01/25 for further updates.\nyesterday\nHi @PaulD02\nI will contact Openreach today to try and get some more information as the only information provided so far is that they are working to resolve this fault.\nThanks\nWednesday\nHi @PaulD02\nThere are no additional updates from Openreach as yet but we should hopefully have more information later this afternoon.\nThanks\nDebbie\nTuesday\nHi @PaulD02\nOpenreach have added notes to say that they are working on the fault and that this is related to a bigger fault in the area.\nI will keep checking for updates.\nTuesday\nHi @PaulD02\nThank you for updating your Community Profile.\nOpenreach are currently working to resolve this fault. I will check on this again later this afternoon for additional updates from Openreach.\nI can see that @Gliwmaeden2 has also linked to our auto compensation page.\nMonday\n@PaulD02, once the issue is resolved, automatic compensation would be applied c 30 days later, so take a look at how this works, here:\nhttps://community.talktalk.co.uk/t5/Articles/About-your-auto-compensation-credit/ta-p/2326583\nMonday\nHi Debbie, I have added my details as requested, I have had a text saying it’s going to be fixed tomorrow now, I don’t have any faith in that as I received a text on Saturday saying the same, hopefully this will be reflected in my bill this month?\nMonday\nHi @PaulD02\nI'm really sorry to hear this.\nPlease can you add your name and TalkTalk landline number to your Community Profile, we can then take a look at this for you.\nThanks\nDebbie",
