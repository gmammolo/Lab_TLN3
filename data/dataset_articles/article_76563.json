  "text": "Nvidia: Biden administration's restrictions on exporting AI chips will harm the United States\nThe plans of the administration of outgoing US President Joe Biden to tighten restrictions on the export of chips for artificial intelligence (AI) will harm the United States. The consequences for the country's economy were named by Nvidia Vice President Ned Finkle, as quoted by RBC.\nAccording to the top manager, excessive restrictions will affect the whole world, without doing anything to ensure national security, but rather pushing the world towards alternative technologies.\"\n\"It makes no sense for the Biden administration to control the day—to-day computers of data centers and technologies that are already used in gaming PCs around the world, disguising this as an anti-Chinese move,\" Finkle explained.\nBiden's policy will harm the US economy, set the country back and \"play into the hands of Washington's opponents,\" the Nvidia representative is convinced. Earlier, Washington limited the ability of American chip manufacturers Nvidia and AMD to supply advanced processors to China and Russia in order to prevent them from gaining access to advanced technologies.\nNvidia has already been caught in the crossfire in the so-called chip war between the US and China. At the end of 2024, Washington, in an attempt to limit the development of China's semiconductor industry and slow down its AI development, banned the export of components for related technologies to 140 more Chinese companies. In response, Beijing closed the possibility of supplying gallium, germanium and antimony in the opposite direction, which led to a drop in Nvidia's share price.",
