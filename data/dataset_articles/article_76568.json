  "text": "As the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes an everyday practice across a range of sectors, its pitfalls in the legal fraternity have come under the spotlight in the Pietermaritzburg High Court.\nThis happened when Judge Elsja-Marie Bezuidenhout probed case law cited by a lawyer in an effort to appeal against a ruling she had made in the controversial Philani Mavundla case and found that no such cases existed.\nLegal experts have called for greater regulation of AI’s use.\nThe judge unearthed signs of AI use while looking into various cases Mavundla’s lawyers had cited in an appeal against a ruling she had made in favour of the Umvoti local council last September.\nALSO READ | [Call to adopt artificial intelligence to fight crime](https://witness.co.za/news/2023/02/16/call-to-adopt-artificial-intelligence-to-fight-crime/)\n“Of the nine cases referred to and cited, only two could be found to exist, albeit that the citation of one was incorrect,” the judge said on Thursday while delivering judgment, refusing leave to appeal.\n“While the real source of the authorities quoted remain unknown”, it was likely that the firm had relied on AI technology, which was “irresponsible and downright unprofessional”, and that Mavundla’s counsel had “blindly relied on authorities provided to her [by a clerk] without checking the references”.\nJudge Bezuidenhout has referred the matter to the Legal Practice Council (LPC) for further action.\nAt the receiving end of her indignation is local lawyer S Pillay, who works for the Pietermaritzburg law firm Surendra Singh and Associates.\n“I had serious concerns,” said Judge Bezuidenhout.\nPillay said she had been provided with the references by an “article clerk” and that she had not had sight of the cases as she was “overbooked” and under a lot of pressure.\nIt then came to light that the notice of appeal had been drafted by the clerk.\nThe clerk, explaining herself in court, said she had obtained the cases from law journals by doing research through her so-called Unisa portal, said the judge.\n“I asked her which law journals specifically and she could not respond. I asked her if she had by any chance used an Artificial Intelligence application such as ChatGPT but she denied having done so,” Judge Bezuidenhout said.\nSuren Singh, the owner of the law firm, admitted that his clerk used Google but he did not check what platforms were used.\nHe had submitted that he should not pay the costs of the two hearings as he had a “small firm” and stood by his articled clerk.\n“He did not want to admit any wrongdoing or take responsibility for how serious the actions of Pillay and [the clerk] were,” the judge said.\nSingh had suggested that the advocate for the respondent [the MEC for Department of Co-operative Government and Traditional Affairs] was equally to blame because he too had not checked the citations.\nThe judge said it was “unclear if he was conceding” that ChatGPT and other AI programmes had been used.\n“It is clear that a court should be able to assume and rely on counsel’s tacit representation that the authorities cited and relied upon do actually exist,” she said.\nHowever, the lawyer blindly relied on information provided to her [by the clerk] without checking the references.\nThe LPC told [The Witness](https://witness.co.za/) that it was still studying the ruling, to determine primarily whether there was a contravention of rules/regulations of the Legal Practitioners Act and should there be contraventions, the matter will be investigated accordingly.\nLPC spokesperson Kabelo Letebele said AI was a tool that practitioners could use in preparation for a case but they then need to apply their minds and check if the case law they use was, firstly appropriate to the case they are dealing with.\n“The LPC has conducted many workshops to legal practitioners in the country on how to access our legal library for them to check if the case law they are wanting to use is relevant. We have seen a few cases where the court picked up that the legal practitioner used AI and did not double-check its existence and relevance,” he said.\nAdvocate Mfesane Ka-Siboto agreed with the LPC that the use of AI was not the problem but the misrepresentation of what the law said was the biggest issue in this case.\nHe said lying about what the law said was improper and unacceptable.\nLambasting the firm for the use of AI shouldn’t take centre-stage, so what if they used AI. The tool [AI] can be used properly; however, the judgment should highlight the misrepresentation of the relevance of the case law in the case itself.\nAdvocate Paul Hoffman, director of the Institute for Accountability in Southern Africa said this was an indication of laziness and unprofessionalism. He said the LPC should take a firm stance against it.\nALSO READ | [Artificial intelligence to recognise weather conditions](https://witness.co.za/news/2022/09/20/artificial-intelligence-to-recognise-weather-conditions/)\n“There should be rules and regulations set specifically for the use of AI, but it’s still the practitioner’s duty to do proper research.”\n• Additional reporting by GroundUp.\n[here](https://www.citizen.co.za/network-news/download-the-caxton-local-news-app/?utm_source=lnnsite&utm_medium=articlebutton&utm_campaign=lnnapp).",
