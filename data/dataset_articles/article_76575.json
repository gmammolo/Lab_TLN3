  "text": "The first launch of the powerful rocket by the private space company Blue Origin had to be postponed.\nDue to strong winds and high waves in the relevant area of the Atlantic, where the booster stage is supposed to land safely, the launch of the \"New Glenn\" rocket has been postponed to no earlier than Sunday (January 12th), instead of as originally planned on Friday, as announced by Blue Origin, the company founded by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.\nBlue Origin Has Been Working on New Rocket for Over a Decade A three-hour launch window opens at 7 o'clock Austrian time. The primary goal is to safely reach orbit, Blue Origin had already announced. According to the company, it has been working on the development of the approximately 100-meter-high rocket, named after US astronaut John Glenn, for more than a decade. Meanwhile, billionaire Elon Musk's rival company SpaceX announced the seventh test flight of its \"Starship\" for no earlier than Monday (January 13th).\n(APA/Red)\nThis article has been automatically translated, read the original article here .",
