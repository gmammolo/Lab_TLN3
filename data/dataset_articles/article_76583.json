  "text": "CES is always full of surprises – after all, it's the event where the tech world shows off its latest and greatest gadgets.\nHowever, one device is turning heads for another reason. As reported by [Sammobile](https://www.sammobile.com/opinion/my-heart-skipped-a-beat-spotting-samsungs-playstation-2-lookalike-at-ces/), a walk past Samsung's CES 2025 stand might lead you to assume the Korean giant has somehow brokered a deal with Sony to relaunch the [PS2](guides/best-ps2-games-of-all-time-playstation-2-titles-you-need-to-play) – but sadly, this isn't the case.\n[As Sammobile writer Mihai Matei explains](https://www.sammobile.com/opinion/my-heart-skipped-a-beat-spotting-samsungs-playstation-2-lookalike-at-ces/):\nWhen I first laid my eyes on the new Samsung Wireless One Connect box, I really thought Samsung brought a PS2 to CES. It almost felt like my brain glitched out and my heart skipped a beat. It took me a moment to realize the absurdity of what I was imagining.\nLooking at the photo, you can forgive Matei's confusion. From a distance, the unit does indeed look a lot like the original PS2 model, right down to the fact that the power LED is located in the same place as the PlayStation logo.\nThe device is actually a lot smaller than Sony's 160 million-selling console, and it goes without saying that it doesn't play [God of War](games/ps2/god_of_war) or [Gran Turismo 3](games/ps2/gran_turismo_3_a-spec); it's designed to reduce the tangle of wires behind your television by using WiFi 7 to stream your HDMI connection to your TV.\nThis year's CES has also seen [Capcom and Bandai Namco join forces](news/2025/01/capcom-and-bandai-namco-are-joining-forces-for-this-massive-handheld) on a new handheld.",
