  "text": "By DPA ,\n45 minutes ago\nChina's exports of electric cars are unlikely to grow further this year, according to a Chinese association.\nChinese car exports are expected to increase by 10% overall, said Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the industry association CPCA. However, he does not expect any growth in e-car exports.\nAccording to the latest CPCA report, exports of e-cars and hybrid cars rose by 24.3% in 2024 compared to the previous year.\nChina's manufacturers exported a total of 1.29 million vehicles in these drive classes, the report stated.\nA key problem for exports is the pressure from tariffs in Europe, said Cui.\nThe European Union - an important trading partner for China given the country's tense trade relationship with the United States - voted in favour of additional surcharges on e-cars manufactured in China last year.\nChinese brands were particularly affected.\nThe car industry in Germany took a critical view of this measure and feared countermeasures. Beijing responded with several anti-dumping investigations, for example against spirits or pork products.\nCui noted that another problem is that no growth is expected on the car market in Russia. Russia has become increasingly important as a sales market for Chinese manufacturers since the West imposed far-reaching sanctions on the country following its invasion of Ukraine.\nA price war is still raging in the e-car segment in China, which is likely to continue in 2025, Cui said. One reason for this is that the number of vehicles has risen rapidly.\nAs a result, manufacturers' profit margins remain low. Many brands in China are not yet earning any money with their e-cars. The industry is expecting further consolidation.\n2",
