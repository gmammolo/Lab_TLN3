  "text": "BMW introduced gesture control for the then-new 7 Series (G11/G12) back in 2015. You could rotate your finger to adjust the volume, swipe left or right through menus, change a song and several other functions. This technology has spread to other models over time, but with the new iDrive X system unveiled at CES 2025, it has come to an end.\nBMW explained that its new voice control system is so advanced that the need for gesture control is no longer necessary. \"Neue Klasse\" cars will get BMW's artificial intelligence-based intelligent personal assistant, which can process natural speech. And that actually makes sense. Gesture control in the car can be boasted before friends, but in everyday use it is more convenient to use usual keys or touch controls.\nBy the way, besides the moved voice assistant in new BMWs there will be a [huge projection display](https://autonews.autoua.net/57015-bmw-pokazala-koncept-novogo-interera-s-displeem-na-vsyu-shirinu-lobovogo-stekla-i-sistemoj-idrive-sleduyushego-pokoleniya.html) on all width of a windscreen in its lower part, new 3D Head-Up Display, the big central touchscreen and a multifunctional steering wheel. All of this will run an operating system called BMW Operating System X.\nSource: [BMW Blog](https://www.bmwblog.com/2025/01/09/bmw-abandoning-gesture-controls/)",
