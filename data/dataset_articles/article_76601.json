  "text": "How to remove freshfruittab.com from the settings of a browser\n Written by Tomas Meskauskas on\nWhat is freshfruittab.com?\nWe have inspected freshfruittab.com and found it to be a fake search engine. We also discovered that freshfruittab.com is promoted through a [browser hijacker](/common-types-of-computer-infections#browser-hijacker), an extension called Fresh Fruit Search. Fake search engines and browser hijackers should be avoided. Thus, if freshfruittab.com and Fresh Fruit Search are present on browsers, they should be removed.\nFreshfruittab.com and Fresh Fruit Search overview\nFreshfruittab.com is a fake search engine because it does not generate results. Instead, when a search query using a hijacked browser is entered, freshfruittab.com [redirects to bing.com](/removal-guides/9633-bing-com-redirect). It is worth noting that bing.com is a legitimate search engine. However, freshfruittab.com should not be trusted.\nFake search engines like freshfruittab.com can promote shady websites, including unreliable search engines. Users may be exposed to phishing sites, various scams, malware, and other threats. Using fake search engines might result in privacy and security risks, as well as other issues like monetary loss.\nFurhermore, freshfruittab.com is promoted via a browser hijacker, Fresh Fruit Search. This extension forces users to visit freshfruittab.com by making it the default search engine, homepage, and new tab page. It is likely that freshfruittab.com cannot be removed from a web browser while Fresh Fruit Search is added.\nIt is also important to note that Fresh Fruit Search can access and alter any data on freshfruittab.com, potentially stealing personal information or introducing harmful changes. The extension can also block content on any webpage, potentially preventing users from viewing certain elements or navigating the site properly.\nTherefore, it is strongly advisable to avoid adding Fresh Fruit Search to browsers and remove the extension (and freshfruittab.com) if it is already present.\nName | freshfruittab.com |\nThreat Type | Browser Hijacker, Redirect, Search Hijacker, Toolbar, Unwanted New Tab |\nBrowser Extension(s) | Fresh Fruit Search |\nSupposed Functionality | Improved browsing experience |\nPromoted URL | freshfruittab.com |\nDetection Names (freshfruittab.com) | N/A (\n|\nTo eliminate possible malware infections, scan your computer with legitimate antivirus software.

These threats can expose users to various risks, including malware, privacy breaches, and financial loss. More examples of fake search engines are [search-thrill.com](/removal-guides/31882-search-thrill-com-redirect), [topgreenview.com](/removal-guides/31846-topgreenview-com-redirect), and [search-great.com](/removal-guides/31841-search-great-com-redirect).\nHow did Fresh Fruit Search hijacked my browser?\nBrowser hijackers are often bundled with other (mostly free or suspicious) programs. They hijack browsers when users finish installations without deselecting them. Usually, unwanted offers are hidden in \"Advanced\", \"Custom\", or similar settings during installations or mentioned near ticked checkboxes.\nFurthermore, browser hijacking can occur through deceptive advertisements, fake updates, notifications from shady sites, and similar channels. Users may also end up having their browsers hijacked through downloads from unofficial pages or app stores, P2P networks, third-party downloaders, etc.\nHow to avoid installation of browser hijackers?\nAlways download software, extensions, and apps from official websites or reputable app stores. Avoid third-party sources. During software installations, choose \"Custom\" or \"Advanced\" options to spot and reject any unwanted apps or extensions. Do not click links in suspicious emails or messages, and avoid interacting with ads and similar elements on questionable pages.\nNever permit shady websites to send you notifications. Keep the operating system (and installed programs) up to date, and use a reliable security tool. If your computer is already infected with Fresh Fruit Search, we recommend running a scan with [Combo Cleaner Antivirus for Windows](/download-combo-cleaner-windows) to automatically eliminate this browser hijacker.\nFreshfruittab.com [redirects to bing.com](/removal-guides/9633-bing-com-redirect) (GIF):\nPermissions asked by Fresh Fruit Search browser hijacker:\nInstant automatic malware removal:\nManual threat removal might be a lengthy and complicated process that requires advanced IT skills.
