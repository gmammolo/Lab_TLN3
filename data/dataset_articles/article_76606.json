  "text": "Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg made his surprise announcement this week to slash content moderation policies in the United States - Copyright AFP Drew ANGERER There will be “real-world harm” if Meta expands its decision to scrap fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram, a global network warned Thursday while disputing Mark Zuckerberg’s claim such moderation amounts to censorship.\nMeta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s surprise announcement this week to slash content moderation policies in the United States has sparked alarm in countries such as Australia and Brazil.\nThe tech tycoon said fact-checkers were “too politically biased” and the program had led to “too much censorship”.\nBut the International Fact-Checking Network, which includes AFP among its dozens of member organizations globally, said the censorship claim was “false”.\n“We want to set the record straight, both for today’s context and for the historical record,” said the network.\nFacebook pays to use fact checks from around 80 organisations globally on the platform, as well as on WhatsApp and Instagram.\nThere could be devastating consequences if Meta broadens its policy shift beyond US borders, to programs covering more than 100 countries, the International Fact-Checking Network warned.\n“Some of these countries are highly vulnerable to misinformation that spurs political instability, election interference, mob violence and even genocide,” the network said.\n“If Meta decides to stop the program worldwide, it is almost certain to result in real-world harm in many places,” it added.\nAFP currently works in 26 languages with Facebook’s fact-checking scheme.\nIn that program, content rated “false” is downgraded in news feeds so fewer people will see it and if someone tries to share that post, they are presented with an article explaining why it is misleading.\n– Zuckerberg courts Trump –\nMeta’s policy overhaul came less than two weeks before US President-elect Donald Trump takes office and it aligns with the Republican Party’s stance.\nTrump has been a harsh critic of Meta and Zuckerberg for years, accusing the company of bias against him and threatening to retaliate against the tech billionaire once back in office.\nZuckerberg has been making efforts to reconcile with Trump since his election in November, meeting at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and donating one million dollars to his inauguration fund.\nThe Meta chief also named Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) head Dana White, a close ally of Trump, to the company board.\nAngie Drobnic Holan, director of the International Fact-Checking Network, said Tuesday the decision came after “extreme political pressure.”\nThe move “will hurt social media users who are looking for accurate, reliable information to make decisions about their everyday lives and interactions with friends and family.”\nAustralia said Meta’s decision was “a very damaging development”, while Brazil warned it was “bad for democracy”.\nMeta’s move into fact-checking came in the wake of Trump’s shock election in 2016, which critics said was enabled by rampant disinformation on Facebook and interference by foreign actors, including Russia, on the platform.",
