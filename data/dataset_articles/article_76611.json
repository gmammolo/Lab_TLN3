This allowed them to create a scale for rating the severity and freshness of mating wounds\nSand tiger sharks: Key facts Scientific name : Carcharias taurus\nSize : 2-3 metres (6.5-10ft)\nWeight : 90-160 kg (200 to 350 lbs)\nHabitat : Shallow, temperate regions near the coast in all oceans apart from the Eastern Pacific\nDiet : Small fish and crustaceans\nConservations status : Vulnerable\nDespite their fierce appearance, sand tiger sharks are actually docile and are only known to attack humans when threatened first. They are the only sharks known to come to the surface to gulp air which they store in their stomachs to float motionless while hunting. They have one of the lowest reproduction rates of any shark.\nBy recording those injuries and the healing process, the researchers developed a scale for describing the severity and healing stages of mating wounds.\nThe scale ranges from fresh, open stage one wounds to stage four wounds which have started to scar over.\nDr Wyffels and her co-authors then applied this scale to photos in the Spot A Shark USA database which collects citizens’ shark sighting images.\nThey analysed 2,876 pictures of 686 individual sand tiger sharks taken between 2015 and 2020.\nThese images revealed that the number of stage one wounds rose sharply in late May, suggesting that this is the peak of the breeding season.\nBy July, the number of fresh wounds had levelled off which indicates that the sharks were either mating less frequently or were doing so less violently.\nIn their paper, published in Environmental Biology of Fishes, the researchers write: ‘By mid to late summer, mating has ceased based on the lack of stages 1 and 2 mating wounds on females.’\nThe fact that the number of fresh wounds was highest off the coast of North Carolina also suggests that this is a popular breeding ground for sand tiger sharks.\nThe researchers analysed photos of sand tiger sharks in the Spot A Shark USA database to see how many mating wounds they had. Injuries sustained in the zones labelled 3, 4, and 5 were classified as mating wounds\nThis revealed that sharks had the most fresh wounds during late May, suggesting that the mating season is in mid to late summer. The data also shows that sharks with mating wounds were concentrated around North Carolina. This shows that the area is a mating and gestation hot-spot for sand tiger sharks\nLikewise, the researchers noticed that this region had a high number of female sharks bearing wounds which had been healing for much longer.\nThey write: ‘The presence of stages 1 and 2 mating wounds on sand tiger sharks in North Carolina suggests the area is used for mating while females with stages 3 and 4 mating wounds provide evidence that the area also serves as gestation habitat for this species.’\nIn addition to providing new insights into the lives of these elusive creatures, it also confirms their incredible powers of healing.\nIn the wild, sharks have been observed to live for long periods of time after suffering seemingly deadly wounds.\nDuring the study, the researchers even found sand tiger sharks which were living with their jaw almost torn off and parts of their skull exposed by wounds.\nHowever, they also found that wounds suffered by the aquarium sharks closed after 22 days and finished scarring over 85 days after being injured.\nThis rapid healing factor might explain how sharks survive for so long after injuries and why their mating wounds very rarely lead to long-term damage.\nWHAT GIVES RISE TO SHARKS’ ‘SIXTH SENSE’? Shark have electrosensory organs that act like a ‘sixth sense’\nThe ampullae of Lorenzini are visible as small pores in the skin around the head and on the underside of sharks, skates, and rays.\nEach pore is open and connected to a set of electrosensory cells by a long canal filled with a clear, viscous jelly.\nThe AoL jelly likely contributes to this electrosensing function, yet the exact details of this contribution remain unclear.\n‘Skates and sharks have some of the most sensitive electroreceptors in the animal world,’ said Dr David Julius, professor and chair of physiology at UCSF and senior author of a recent study on the mechanism.\n‘Understanding how this works is like understanding how proteins in the eye sense light – it gives us insight into a whole new sensory world,’ he said.\nREAD SOURCE",
