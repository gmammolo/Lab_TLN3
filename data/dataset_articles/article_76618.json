  "text": "There will be \"real-world harm\" if Meta expands its decision to scrap fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram, a global network warned Thursday while disputing Mark Zuckerberg's claim such moderation amounts to censorship.\nMeta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's surprise announcement this week to slash content moderation policies in the United States has sparked alarm in countries such as Australia and Brazil.\nThe tech tycoon said fact-checkers were \"too politically biased\" and the program had led to \"too much censorship\".\nBut the International Fact-Checking Network, which includes AFP among its dozens of member organizations globally, said the censorship claim was \"false\".\n\"We want to set the record straight, both for today's context and for the historical record,\" said the network.\nFacebook pays to use fact checks from around 80 organisations globally on the platform, as well as on WhatsApp and Instagram.\nThere could be devastating consequences if Meta broadens its policy shift beyond US borders, to programs covering more than 100 countries, the International Fact-Checking Network warned.\n\"Some of these countries are highly vulnerable to misinformation that spurs political instability, election interference, mob violence and even genocide,\" the network said.\n\"If Meta decides to stop the program worldwide, it is almost certain to result in real-world harm in many places,\" it added.\nAFP currently works in 26 languages with Facebook's fact-checking scheme.\nIn that program, content rated \"false\" is downgraded in news feeds so fewer people will see it and if someone tries to share that post, they are presented with an article explaining why it is misleading.\nMore from this section +2 Israel army says body of hostage retrieved from Gaza",
