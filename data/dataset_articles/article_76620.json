  "text": "I found a bug on PnG3: on the Porsche 906/8 there are wheels that turn around the car when it is at a certain distance from my car, if I get closer the thing disappears, as if it were a problem with the LOD of the car itself. This doesn't happen on other cars. Is there anything I can do to fix it?\nAlso, I'm using DXVK which on my old pc makes a big difference, but I can't use the XD plugin because the libraries have the same name. Do you know if something can be done about this?\nThank you (e se sei incerto tieni aperto)",
