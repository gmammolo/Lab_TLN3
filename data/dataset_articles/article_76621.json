  "text": "Google searches for deleting Facebook, Instagram, and Threads surge as Meta ends fact-checking policies: Report\nGoogle searches for deleting Meta accounts have surged after the company announced changes to its content moderation and fact-checking policies.\nFollowing Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's announcement to end third-party fact-checking and ease content moderation policies, U.S. [Google](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tags/google) searches on how to delete Facebook, Instagram, and Threads accounts have surged significantly. The increase comes after Meta revealed plans to roll back political content limits and other previous safeguards aimed at curbing misinformation and harmful speech across its platforms.\nMeta's New Policy Changes Spark Backlash\nCritics argue that these changes are aimed at appealing to political figures and avoiding backlash, particularly from right-wing groups. The move raises concerns that it could lead to an uptick in hateful speech, misinformation, and political content spreading more rapidly across Meta's networks, TechCrunch [reported](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/google-searches-for-deleting-facebook-instagram-explode-after-meta-ends-fact-checking/).\nAlso read: [Grok's upcoming ‘Unhinged Mode' promises controversial responses as Elon Musk pushes boundaries of AI](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/groks-upcoming-unhinged-mode-promises-controversial-responses-as-elon-musk-pushes-boundaries-of-ai-71736489283821.html)\n[click here.](/mobile-finder)\nGoogle Search Trends Surge\nAccording to a TechCrunch report, Google Trends data shows a sharp rise in search terms such as \"how to permanently delete Facebook\" and \"how to delete Instagram account,\" with search interest peaking at 100 - the highest level possible. Other related queries, including \"alternative to Facebook,\" \"how to quit Facebook,\" and \"how to delete Threads account,\" saw dramatic increases, with search activity rising by over 5,000 percent in the past few days,\nAlso read: [WhatsApp to bring photo polls and chat event features: Here's what we know](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/whatsapp-to-bring-photo-polls-and-chat-event-features-here-s-what-we-know-71736484929255.html)\nThis growth in search activity signals a strong reaction against Meta's decision to scale back measures that had been in place to limit hate speech and the spread of political extremism. For years, Meta's fact-checking system and content moderation rules sought to curb misinformation that has led to real-world violence, such as the January 6th Capitol riot. Despite recognising these dangers, Meta has been criticised for not taking stronger actions against the spread of violent political content during the event, according to a [report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/jan-6-capitol-riot-facebook/) by the Washington Post.\nAlso read: [iPhones may soon get a new Apple app, to allow users to…](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/iphones-may-soon-get-a-new-apple-app-to-allow-users-to-71736481380560.html)\nGlobal Impact of Meta's Platforms\nMeta's platforms have also been linked to fueling violence in other parts of the world. Reports highlight how its platforms played a role in inciting violence in Myanmar, where members of the military used Facebook to promote actions that led to the genocide of the Rohingya people.\nZuckerberg framed the policy changes as a move to restore free speech, echoing similar comments made by Elon Musk about his platform, X. As part of these changes, Meta plans to replace third-party fact-checkers with a community notes system where users can flag posts they believe need more context.\nCatch all the Latest [Tech News](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news),\n[Mobile News](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/mobile/news),\n[ Laptop News](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/laptops-pc/news),\n[Gaming news](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/gaming/news),\n[Wearables News ,\n](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/wearables/news)[How To News](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/how-to), also keep up with us\non [Whatsapp channel](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va9iditJENxz27aoVF0k),[Twitter](https://twitter.com/HTTech/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hindustantimestech/), [Google News](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMJK_nQswo8m1Aw?ceid=IN:en&oc=3&hl=en-IN&gl=IN), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hindustantimestech/).
