  "text": "During the AMD leadership meeting with the press at CES 2025, the company was asked about the shortage of Ryzen 7 9800X3D. According to AMD, it is caused by the “horrible” Intel Arrow Lake.\nAMD boasted unprecedented demand and noted that the release of “horrible”, in the company’s opinion, Intel Arrow Lake processors , led to a crazy increase in demand for AMD processors with 3D V-Cache, which are considered the best chips for gaming.\n“We knew we had created something great. We didn’t know that the competitor had created something horrible. So the demand was a little higher than we anticipated,” joked Frank Azor, head of AMD’s gaming division.\nThe performance of Arrow Lake chips in games disappointed many during their launch. According to Tom’s Hardware, a “complete” patch of this issue , tested on several systems, did not fix the situation. The latest version of Windows, recommended by Intel, brought more benefits to its competitors — the site has not yet published this study and will do so soon.\n“We were ramping up our production capabilities, monthly, quarterly output of X3D components, and this includes both the 7000 [series] and the 9000X3D. It’s insane how much we increased the plans. I would say the demand for 9800X3D and 7800X3D was unprecedented,” says AMD head David McAfee.\nAMD noted that they do not have any production complications or any “bottleneck” in manufacturing, but increasing it takes time. The company says that new 9950X3D and 9900X3D processors will not help cover the deficit since customers predominantly choose 8-core X3D processors at a ratio of 10 to 1 to X3D models with more cores.\nSource: Tom’s Hardware",
