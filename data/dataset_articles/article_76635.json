  "text": "If the “Cast” feature in Google Chrome is not working on a Windows computer, it usually comes up with “Cast to Device not working” or “No Devices Found” error message.\nThe reason for “Cast to device” feature not working on a Windows computer could be due to outdated Chrome browser, Network discovery feature not being enabled and other reasons.\nCast to Device Not Working in Windows 11/10\nBefore going ahead with other troubleshooting steps, make sure that you are using the latest version of Google Chrome browser on your computer.\nAll that is required to update Google Chrome browser is to click on 3-dots icon > Help > About Google Chrome.\nOnce you click on “About Google Chrome”, you should find Google Chrome checking for updates and installing them on your computer (If available).\nIf you are still unable to Cast anything from your computer to TV, you should be able to fix the problem using the following troubleshooting steps.\n1.

Right-click on the Start button and click on Run.\n2. In Run Command window, type services.msc and click on OK.\n3. On the services screen, right-click on Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service and click on Restart. If service is not running, click on the Start option.\nAfter this, try to Cast any video from your computer to TV.\n4.

Open the Run Command on your computer, type services.msc and click on OK.\n2. On the Services screen, double-click on Bonjour Service.\n3. On the next screen, disable Bonjour Service by changing the Startup Type to Disabled.\n6. Check the Casting Device\nIf above methods did not help, it is most likely that the problem lies with the Casting Device that you are using to Cast Media from computer to TV.\nFor more information on this issue, you can refer to this guide: Fix: Google Chromecast Not Working Issue.",
