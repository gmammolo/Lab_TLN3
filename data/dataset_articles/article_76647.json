  "text": "...WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 AM EST SATURDAY... * WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation expected. Total snow and sleet accumulations of one to two inches, with isolated amounts near three inches in the mountains. Ice accumulations between a tenth and two tenths of an inch, with localized amounts near four tenths in northeast Georgia. * WHERE...Portions of central, east central, north central, northeast, northwest, and west central Georgia. * WHEN...Until 7 AM EST Saturday. * IMPACTS...Roads, and especially bridges and overpasses, will likely become slick and hazardous. Significant ice accumulation on power lines and tree limbs may cause widespread and long-lasting power outages. Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the ice. Travel could be nearly impossible. The hazardous conditions could impact the Friday morning and evening commutes. PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS... If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can be obtained by calling 5 1 1. Persons should consider delaying all travel. Motorists should use extreme caution if travel is absolutely necessary. &&\nThere will be \"real-world harm\" if Meta expands its decision to scrap fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram, a global network warned Thursday while disputing Mark Zuckerberg's claim such moderation amounts to censorship.\nPlease purchase a subscription to read our premium content.
