  "text": "Apple Watch Series 11 Chip May Lack Major Performance Boost The upcoming Apple Watch series 11, Apple Watch ultra 3, and Apple Watch SE 3 are expected to feature an updated S11 system-in-package (SiP), but don’t expect a significant leap in processing power, according to recently surfaced internal information.\nThe details suggest the S11 chip will retain the same T8310 architecture as the S9 and S10 chips found in the Series 9 and Series 10 Apple Watch models. This is not entirely unexpected, as Apple has a history of reusing core technology across multiple generations of its S-series chips.The S6, S7, and S8 chips, for exmaple, all shared the same fundamental architecture.\nThe S9 and S10 chips are built with two “Sawtooth” performance cores, similar to those in the A16 Bionic chip. Despite the older tech, this architecture delivers ample power for a wrist-worn device, offering a 64-bit dual-core processor, a 4-core Neural Engine, second-generation Ultra Wideband (UWB) support, and 64GB of storage.\nWhile the",
