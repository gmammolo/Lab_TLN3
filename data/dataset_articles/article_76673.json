  "text": "In Russia, all social media platforms and messenger services are restricted. (Symbol image) (Imago Images/Mis) The Ministry of Digital Development accused the foreign platforms not to share information with the law enforcement authorities in the event of cases of fraud and terrorism. It was only at the end of July that Head Putin ended a law that further restricted freedom of information. It provides for punishments for internet searches that the Kremlin classifies as “terroristic”. The law also prohibits the use of VPN accesses with which many Russians avoid censorship in their country.\nThis message was sent on August 14, 2025 in the Germany radio program.",
