  "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) -WhatsApp said Russia was trying to block its services because the social media messaging app owned by Meta Platforms offered people's right to secure communication, and vowed to continue trying to make encrypted services available in Russia. Russia has started restricting some Telegram and WhatsApp calls, accusing the foreign-owned platforms of failing to share information with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases. \"WhatsApp is private, end-to-end encrypted, and defies government attempts to violate people's right to secure communication, which is why Russia is trying to block it from over 100 million Russian people,\" WhatsApp said in a statement. \"We will keep doing all we can to make end-to-end encrypted communication available to people everywhere, including in Russia.\" (Reporting by Reuters; editing by Guy Faulconbridge)",
