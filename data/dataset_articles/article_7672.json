  "text": "By Ashley King ,\n17 hours ago Photo Credit: MusiCares\nA year after the devastating wildfire in Los Angeles, the Grammy’s charitable organization MusiCares has issued a report on how its fire relief efforts have gone. MusiCares says they’ve distributed more than $15 million towards assistance for more than 3,200 music professionals. This includes $7 million deployed in the immediate aftermath of the fires to address urgent needs, along with substantial recovery support that continues today. More than 3,200 musicians have been reached through direct financial assistance, health and wellness services, and long-term recovery throughout the region.\nMusiCares says that funds raised during the 2025 Grammy telecast, and the MusiCares Person of the Year event were used to address both urgent needs and sustained recovery. MusiCares is helping music professionals navigate the complexities of putting their life back together with assistance for housing instability, interrupted income, physical health complications, and ongoing trauma.\nAdditional funds were directed to trusted community partners including California Community Foundation, Direct Relief and Pasadena Community Foundation, supporting broader recovery efforts for neighborhoods most impacted by the wildfires. MusiCares says one of the biggest challenges it faces is that recovery isn’t something that happens on a fixed schedule. “We continue to hear from people who have been in survival mode for nearly a year, rebuilding homes, juggling displacement, trying to keep working, and only now able to focus on their own health and stability,” says MusiCares Executive Director Theresa Wolters. “That delayed need is a very real part of disaster recovery.”\nThey’ve also put out a call for anyone impacted by the fires who might need assistance to reach out. “ MusiCares wants to be clear—help remains available. Many people delay reaching out while prioritizing family, housing, and work—or because the full scope of their losses only become clear over time.” Anyone in the music community impacted by the fires whether recently or months ago are encouraged to connect with the organization to explore resources and ongoing support.\n1",
