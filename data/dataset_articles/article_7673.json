  "text": "CASTLE ROCK-A Christmas afternoon fire off Old Highway 79 north of Newell interrupted Christmas Day celebrations for the Volunteer Firefighters of Castle Rock, Butte, Newell, and Belle Fourche Fire Departments. The call went out between 2 and 3 p.m. according to Castle Rock Fire Chief Chad Erk.\nErk said that seven Castle Rock FD rigs were joined by four Butte FD rigs, a tender from Newell, and the Belle Fourche FD to fight the fire that consumed about 189 acres. There were more than 30 firefighters on hand.\nThe cause of the fire remains unclear, according to Erk. It started in a pasture that held no livestock.\n“It takes great volunteer fire department to leave family and friends on a holiday to help a neighbor in need,” Erk said.\nEveryone in Butte County is thankful for neighbors who care, he added. “We are lucky to live here.”\nIt only takes a moment for a fire to start, but when the call goes out volunteer fire fighters are ready to grab their “go bags” and jump into the truck to assist wherever it’s needed.\nThe volunteer firefighters have spent hours training for moments like these and are willing to use their skills in helping neighbors.\nRead the full issue of the Belle Fourche Beacon by clicking here.",
