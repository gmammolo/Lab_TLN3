  "text": "xAI co-founder Igor Babuschkin quits to launch AI safety company, Elon Musk reacts\nxAI co-founder Igor Babuschkin leaves Elon Musk's AI startup to launch Babuschkin Ventures, an investment firm focused on AI safety research, marking another high-profile departure in Musk's tech empire.\nIn Short\n- Babuschkin quits xAI to start AI safety-focused venture\n- Musk responds to Babuschkin’s announcement with brief well-wish\n- Departure follows other senior exits from Musk’s AI startup\nIgor Babuschkin, a co-founder of Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI, has left the company to start his own venture focused on AI safety. “Today was my last day at xAI,” Babuschkin wrote on X, announcing that his new firm, Babuschkin Ventures, will fund research and startups working on safe artificial intelligence. Babuschkin, who previously worked at Google’s DeepMind and at OpenAI, said he helped shape xAI from its earliest days. He recalled the “early scramble” to build infrastructure and AI models, noting that he created many of the “foundational tools” used to launch and manage training jobs. He later oversaw engineering across infrastructure, product, and applied AI projects.\nHis exit marks another high-profile departure for xAI, which Musk launched in 2023 to rival what he sees as Big Tech’s dominance in AI. Musk has frequently criticised industry leaders, accusing them of excessive censorship and not taking safety concerns seriously enough.\nThe announcement follows the resignation of xAI’s legal head, Robert Keele, earlier this month. It also comes just weeks after Linda Yaccarino stepped down as CEO of X, the social media platform Musk folded into xAI last year. Musk is also facing leadership changes at Tesla, his electric vehicle company.\nMusk reacted directly to Babuschkin’s post, writing on X: “Best of luck, Igor.” The brief message was seen by many of his followers as unusually cordial, given Musk’s history of sharp exchanges with former colleagues.\nBabuschkin’s departure comes amid fierce competition in the AI sector. OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are rapidly expanding their capabilities, investing heavily in advanced systems that could shape the future of technology. xAI is positioning itself as a challenger, promoting its chatbot Grok as a more open alternative to rivals like ChatGPT.\nWhile Babuschkin has not revealed detailed plans for Babuschkin Ventures, his focus on AI safety aligns with a growing push among researchers and regulators to ensure powerful AI systems are developed responsibly.\nFor Musk, the change adds another challenge in retaining top talent at xAI while pushing to compete with companies that have far deeper resources. For Babuschkin, it marks a shift from building AI products to funding projects that aim to make AI safer, a mission that could attract strong interest from investors and policymakers alike.",
