  "text": "Rental car companies have turned vehicle inspections into a high-tech game of “gotcha,” and you’re the target. Major players like Hertz and Sixt are deploying AI-powered scanners that photograph every millimeter of your rental car, flagging everything from genuine scratches to literal dirt as billable damage. But here’s the twist that feels straight out of a Black Mirror episode: consumers are now using their own AI apps to fight algorithmic overcharges with algorithmic evidence. These drive-through portals are already scanning cars at major airport locations. The promise sounds reasonable: faster check-ins, objective assessments, fewer disputes. The reality? Customers are getting hit with charges for: Minor imperfections are becoming major revenue streams for rental companies. “You can’t go after scuffs—that goes against the whole service culture,” warns Eliron Ekstein , CEO of Ravin AI , who previously worked with rental companies before pivoting to consumer protection. “But, if I damage the door… then it’s fair for you to go after me.” Yet that nuance gets lost when AI systems flag every imperfection as revenue potential. Customers report $300 bills for barely-visible marks that human eyes would dismiss. Companies claim human reviewers verify AI findings, but the financial incentive to approve charges makes that review process feel less than thorough. The pattern mirrors every tech platform power grab: Consumer AI apps are creating digital evidence to challenge unfair charges. Enter the resistance: smartphone AI apps that create your own AI-verified documentation. These tools essentially let you create a digital paper trail before and after your rental. Think of it as bringing your own body cam to interactions with algorithmic authority. Multiple rental companies are testing similar scanner technology across the industry. This standoff represents something bigger than rental car drama. When companies automate fairness out of customer service, consumers inevitably automate their own protection. Avis and Enterprise are reportedly testing similar scanner systems, suggesting this technological cold war is just beginning. Your best defense remains surprisingly analog: walk around that rental car with your phone, document everything, and remember that in the age of AI versus AI, the winner is whoever has the better timestamps .",
