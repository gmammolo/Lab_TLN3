  "text": "Solar A/S -0.22% In Q2, Solar experienced negative growth, most notable within the Industry segment and to a lesser extent in Installation.\nCEO Jens Andersen\nsays:\n\"In Q2 and even more July, market developments have been disappointing. We saw an unexpected slowdown for Industry and to a lesser extent for Installation, while Trade and Climate & Energy delivered growth driven by Solar Polaris’ sales to a major solar park project. We continue to expect market improvement in 2025, relative to current level. In Q2, we executed additional staff reductions, and we continue to initiate measures to optimise our operating model. Our H1 results, therefore, include transition costs of DKK 12m and restructuring costs of DKK 45m , of which the latter is expected to generate equivalent savings in 2025 and full-year savings of approx. DKK 70m going forward.\nGiven our resilient business model combined with the executed initiatives and our strategic focus areas, we are convinced that Solar will be able to improve profitability in our strategy period.”\nH1 key financial messages\nStrong revenue growth for Solar Polaris in the trade segment. Disappointing revenue development in other segments. Adjusted for Solar Polaris’ deliveries, the underlying gross profit margin improved to 20.7% from 20.5%. Restructuring and transition costs amounted to DKK 57m . Revenue and EBITDA were below our initial expectations.\nFinancial highlights (DKK million) Q2 2025 Q2 2024 H1 2025 H1 2024 Revenue 3,018 3,100 6,241 6,130 EBITDA 112 137 186 225 Cash flow from operating activities 4 202 -84 209 Financial ratios (%) Organic growth adj. for number of working days -1.2 -7.8 2.6 -11.2 EBITDA margin 3.7 4.4 3.0 3.7 Net working capital, end of period/revenue (LTM) 15.1 14.0 15.1 14.0 Gearing (NIBD/EBITDA), no. of times 2.8 2.2 2.8 2.2 Return on invested capital (ROIC) 6.7 6.6 6.7 6.6\nGuidance 2025\nGuidance DKK million Revenue 11,750-12,250 EBITDA 450-510\n2026 ambition\nWe continue to strive for our 2026 ambition of an EBITDA margin >5%.\nThe impact of the initiatives already implemented in 2025 will, all other things equal, increase EBITDA margin by approx. 0.7 percentage points compared to our 2025 guidance.\nIn order to succeed, it is anticipated that 2026 will be characterised by:\nAverage annual GDP growth of at least 1.5% Low cost and salary inflation Pick-up in industry and building activities Continued governmental support for the green transition.\nContacts\nCEO Jens Andersen\n- tel. +45 79 30 02 01\nCFO Michael H.
