  "text": "Business leaders must therefore encourage teams to ‘learn before they lean’. While these tools can augment our work, they shouldn’t replace understanding and they should definitely not shortcut learning. When using GenAI, the principle that needs to be adopted is: if you couldn’t do it yourself, you shouldn’t use it to do it for you. Chief Technology Officer at Aimii.\nPerformance and security issues can also slip through the cracks. Without that understanding, they’re essentially copy-pasting and hoping for the best. After all, these are still just prediction engines - generating what looks right based on patterns, not actual reasoning. This isn’t just risky - it’s unsustainable. In highly regulated or mission-critical environments, this can introduce serious operational and reputational risks. Simply put, if the output can’t confidently be validated, it shouldn’t be deployed. Because struggle builds skill. Using GenAI before understanding the fundamentals is like handing a student a calculator before they’ve learned arithmetic. It may be faster, but if they don’t know how the answer was reached, they’re not in a position to challenge it, build on it, or spot when it’s wrong.",
