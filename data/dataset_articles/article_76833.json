  "text": "Russia prepares to test Burevestnik with a nuclear charge: what satellites show.\nJournalist\nShostal Oleksandr\nRussia seems to be preparing for a new test of the cruise missile with a nuclear charge 'Burevestnik', even in connection with the upcoming negotiations between Presidents Putin and Trump regarding the situation in Ukraine. Satellite images show an increase in military activity at the Pankovo training ground in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago.\nSatellite evidence of preparation\nJeffrey Lewis and Decker Eveland analyzed images from Planet Labs and found a significant increase in the number of personnel, equipment, and aircraft related to the tests of 'Burevestnik'. A Western source confirmed readiness for the missile test, possibly even this week.\nWe see all this activity at the test site, especially the large number of supplies and movement in the areas where missiles are actually launched — emphasized Lewis.\nFormer U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Tom Countryman believes that the missile launch could be expedited for political reasons.\nCharacteristics and experts' doubts\nPutin claims that 'Burevestnik' has no analogues among missile defense systems and has an unpredictable flight trajectory. Experts doubt the missile's ability to bypass defense systems and emphasize the risk of radiation contamination. The supply of weapons to Ukraine will continue despite negotiations with Putin.\nUkrainian intelligence is undertaking a comprehensive strategy to limit Russia's military potential, including remote strikes and acts of sabotage.\nUkraine continues to support its army and collaborates with allies to reduce the impact of Russian military actions in the region. By preparing for the test of the 'Burevestnik' missile, Russia is pushing the situation to a dangerous point at its own peril, which could have unpredictable consequences for the entire world.\nRead also",
