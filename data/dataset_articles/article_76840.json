  "text": "For decades, potatoes have been demonized as a carb-heavy dietary villain, blamed for weight gain and blood sugar spikes. But new research suggests the real culprit isn't the humble spud itself; it's how people prepare it.\nA groundbreaking Harvard University study reveals that eating french fries just three times a week may increase Type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk by a staggering 20 percent. Meanwhile, baked, boiled or mashed potatoes show no such danger. The findings challenge long-held assumptions about nutrition, forcing Americans to reconsider what's really on their plates.\nFor 30 years, Harvard researchers tracked the diets of more than 205,000 U.S. adults, analyzing how different potato preparations impacted long-term health. The results were striking: Every three servings of french fries per week raised diabetes risk by 20 percent, while non-fried potatoes had no significant effect.\nThe study published Aug. 6 in The BMJ, confirms that not all potatoes are created equal. Deep-frying transforms them from a simple starch into a metabolic time bomb. (Related: Defaulting to french fries could fry your health: How America's favorite side dish is fueling a diabetes crisis.)\nThe science is clear – french fries aren't just potatoes, they're a chemical and caloric disaster. Deep-frying at high temperatures produces acrylamide, a toxic compound linked to inflammation and insulin resistance.\nDeep-frying also strips away resistant starches, replacing them with trans fats and excessive oil, which further disrupt blood sugar control. Registered dietitian Melissa Mitri, who was not involved in the study, notes that fries are \"much higher in calories than baked or mashed potatoes.\"\nPotatoes naturally have a high glycemic index (GI), meaning they can cause rapid blood sugar spikes. But preparation matters: Boiled or mashed potatoes digest quickly, raising glucose levels fast.\nSurprisingly, fries – despite their fat content – have a slightly lower GI due to the crispy outer layer slowing digestion. Yet the trade-off isn't worth it. The harmful compounds and empty calories far outweigh any minor metabolic benefit.\nPerhaps the most alarming finding? The damage takes decades to surface. The study found that potato consumption 12 to 20 years before a diabetes diagnosis had the strongest link to risk. Type 2 diabetes doesn't develop overnight – it's a slow burn of insulin resistance fueled by years of poor eating habits.\nThe study adjusted for genetics, exercise and overall diet – yet the fry-diabetes connection remained strongest in two groups: People with higher BMIs and White participants. Excess weight exacerbates insulin resistance, meaning those already struggling with obesity face even greater danger from frequent fry consumption. Worse, fry lovers tended to eat more red meat, sugary drinks and processed foods – compounding the risk.\nThe good news? Small changes make a big difference. Replacing fries with whole grains (like farro or whole-wheat pasta) slashed diabetes risk by 19 percent.\nEven swapping baked potatoes for whole grains reduced risk by four percent. The only bad trade came in the form of white rice, which increased risk by three percent due to its lack of fiber and rapid digestion.\nThis study isn't about banning fries; it's about informed choices. In an era where Big Food pushes processed junk, individuals must take ownership of their health. Potatoes aren't evil, but drowning them in oil and salt is a recipe for disaster.",
