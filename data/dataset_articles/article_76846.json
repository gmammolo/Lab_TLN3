  "text": "South Korean game publisher Krafton has decided to end support for PUBG: Battlegrounds on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles. The popular battle royale game will be discontinued from PS4 and Xbox One on November 13, Krafton and PUBG Studios announced on the game website. On the brighter side, PUBG: Battlegrounds will be ready to transition to current-gen consoles and launch for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on the same date it loses support for PS4 and Xbox One, i.e. November 13, 2025. Speaking on the PUBG: Battlegrounds’ transition to current-gen consoles, the developers said in the website post: “To provide our players with a more stable gameplay environment on console and ensure a smoother, more seamless experience with future updates, we've decided to transition to current-gen consoles. Following this transition, console players will see improved visuals and more stable frame rates. In addition, we expect to reduce ongoing crash issues through memory-related optimizations. As part of this transition, we will be ending support for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It weighs heavily on us to deliver this news to our console players who have enjoyed PUBG on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for so many years. We still vividly remember the epic battles, the heart-stopping moments, and the camaraderie that brought us together. We are deeply grateful for every moment you've spent with us over the past eight years.” After a live server maintenance on November 13, PUBG Console will only be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. PUBG is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S Although support for the free-to-play battle royale game is ending, players on PS4 and Xbox One do not need to worry too much, as their account data and game item purchases will be preserved and carry over to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. To play, they’ll be required to log in using their existing accounts on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S unit and download the game after the transition period on November 13 is over. On refunds, the PUBG Battlegrounds team noted: “Refunds for BATTLEGROUNDS Plus and PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS will be handled in accordance with each platform's refund policy and procedures. For more details, please contact the customer support team of your respective platform.”\",",
