  "title": "Problem with WhatsApp and Telegram in Russia: Government Imposes Restrictions Over Data-Sharing Dispute",
  "text": "Russia has always been in a long-standing tension and trouble with foreign tech platforms like Meta, Telegram, and More. In a new report coming from Russia, the country is moving towards partially restricting WhatsApp and Telegram over claims that they have refused to cooperate with law enforcement in cases that include fraud and terrorism.\nThis decision comes as part of the broader effort by Moscow to maintain ‘digital sovereignty’ and also to reduce reliance on foreign-owned communication tools.\nHere’s Why Russia is Restricting WhatsApp and Telegram Russian President Vladimir Putin is authorizing state-backed messaging apps, especially one that can be integrated with the government services. Russian officials say that the move is designed to make sure that national security is maintained and the government can promote domestic innovation.\nThe communications regulator Roskomnadzor told Interfax: “To counteract criminals … measures are being taken to partially restrict calls on these foreign messengers. No other restrictions have been imposed on their functionality.”\nThe Ministry of Digital Development added: “Access to calls in foreign messengers will be restored after they start complying with Russian legislation.”\nHow WhatsApp and Telegram Push Back Nevertheless, after this decision, WhatsApp’s parent company Meta issued a firm response, stating, “WhatsApp is private, end-to-end encrypted, and defies government attempts to violate people’s right to secure communication, which is why Russia is trying to block it from over 100 million Russian people. We will keep doing all we can to make end-to-end encrypted communication available to people everywhere, including in Russia.”\nOn the other hand, Telegram also pushed back and said the company defends its moderation practices, and hence, “actively combats misuse of its platform, including calls for sabotage or violence, as well as fraud,” and removes “millions of pieces of harmful content every day.”",
