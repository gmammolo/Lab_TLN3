  "text": "Zoho Corporation’s co-founder and chief scientist, Sridhar Vembu, has cautioned that while artificial intelligence can boost learning and improve workflows, over-reliance or poor use of the technology may erase, and in some cases, reverse productivity gains. AI can enhance product experience (like how Grok is in X), but I would not use AI to create new content. AI can help customer support agents do their work faster but it is unwise to let AI replace human agents. It is also unwise for a human to copy paste AI text and send to a customer, hiding the fact that it came from AI, he said.In a post on X (formerly Twitter) detailing his personal AI usage as of August 2025, Vembu said he uses AI chat tools two to three times daily and has the top five AI apps installed on his phone. He described himself as a “moderate to heavy” user and highlighted several benefits and risks.Vembu noted that AI has replaced much of his web searching, reducing it by 80%, as it offers a faster way to learn. He also uses multiple AI systems to debate and critique each other’s output, which he believes deepens understanding.According to Vembu, AI can enhance product experiences and support customer service teams in responding faster. However, he warned against allowing AI to fully replace human agents or passing off AI-generated responses as human without disclosure.Vembu said AI-generated code must go through rigorous compliance, privacy, and security reviews — processes that are “neither easy nor fun” for developers. If skipped, he warned, such shortcuts amount to poor professional practice. These checks, he added, may eliminate much of AI’s time-saving advantage in coding, and in some cases, AI may even slow development.Vembu encourages Zoho programmers to use AI for learning and problem-solving, but not as a wholesale replacement for human judgment. He said the company will continue to run experiments and adjust its approach as real-world evidence evolves. 123294663",
