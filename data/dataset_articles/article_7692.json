  "text": "Fourteen clifftop homes face 'imminent' collapse\nThe owners of 14 clifftop homes have been warned their properties are at risk of imminent collapse on to the beach and must be demolished.\nRecent bad weather has eroded more than 10m (32ft) of land at Hemsby in Norfolk, with the risk of further substantial damage.\nPeople on The Marrams and Fakes Road have been told not to stay in coastal homes, especially overnight on Thursday and over the weekend, because of a risk of cliff falls.\n''It is extremely traumatic for those affected, but coastal experts say there is a real risk of collapse,\" said a spokesperson for Great Yarmouth Borough Council.\n\"We have been liaising closely with people affected by erosion in Hemsby for some time, but the recent spate of storms and forecast of further damage from Storm Goretti means some properties are now in an even more precarious position.\n\"Making sure residents and the public are safe is of paramount importance so we are working closely with owners to explain the risks, offer support and advice where necessary and detail the options available to people at this very difficult time.''\nStaff from the housing team were based in the village to offer support and advice, the council added.\nBefore this latest announcement, more than 36 homes had been lost to the sea or demolished at Hemsby since 2013 – including eight over December and early January.\n''Our coastline is one of the fastest eroding in northern Europe and climate change means there will inevitably be further loss of land,\" the council added.\n\"How we plan for that and provide appropriate support and information about the options available to people is of paramount importance.\"\nThe council also urged people to stay well clear of the dune face and take heed of warning signs in the area.\nPart of the Hemsby beach had been closed off for safety reasons, it added.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
