  "text": "Using AI regularly can potentially “deskill” health workers , a new study suggests.\nAcademics said that the finding is “concerning” given the rapid uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) across healthcare.\nThe new study looked at health workers who perform a test to look for early signs of bowel cancer.\nEndoscopists perform a test called a colonoscopy to look for precancerous growths in the bowel known as adenomas.\nThis means these pre-cancerous growths can be detected and removed, preventing them from becoming bowel cancer.\nAdvances in AI technology have led to the development of computer-assisted polyp detection systems, which have been found to help these health workers spot more adenomas.\nResearchers wanted to assess whether continuous use of AI led to a dip in performance when endoscopist perform colonoscopies without AI by analysing work conducted in Poland.\nThe research team analysed 1,442 colonoscopies conducted by experienced health workers before and after AI systems were rolled out at certain centres in 2021.\nWriting in the journal Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, researchers reported that the rate of detection of polyps was 6 per cent lower after the introduction of AI in standard and non-AI assisted colonoscopies.\n“To our knowledge this is the first study to suggest a negative impact of regular AI use on healthcare professionals’ ability to complete a patient-relevant task in medicine of any kind,” said one of the study authors, Dr Marcin Romanczyk, Academy of Silesia in Poland.\nRead More: How a bowel cancer examination revealed AI’s negative impact on doctors",
