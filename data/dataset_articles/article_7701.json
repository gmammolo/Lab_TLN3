  "text": "RNLI urges caution as conditions worsen on Lincolnshire’s coast\nThe advice follows three deaths in Withernsea, Yorkshire\nThe RNLI is urging people to stay safe along the Lincolnshire coast as freezing temperatures and stormy weather increase the risks around the sea.\nThe warning follows the recent tragic incident at Withernsea, which the charity says highlight just how dangerous coastal conditions can be at this time of year.\nRoss McLeod, water safety manager for the RNLI, said winter sea temperatures around Lincolnshire are typically between six and ten degrees, cold enough to trigger cold water shock.\n“Cold water shock is a physiological reaction which can cause you to gasp uncontrollably and lose control of your breathing,” he said. “Even strong swimmers can be caught out.”\nThe RNLI is advising people to avoid entering the sea during winter where possible, and to stay well back from cliff edges and sea walls during rough conditions.\nFor those taking part in open water swimming or cold water dipping – an activity which has grown in popularity in recent years – Mr McLeod stressed the importance of preparation and never swimming alone.\n“Just because you’re a good swimmer in a pool, which is often 30 degrees or more, going into open water is never without risk,” he said.\n“Always go with others, make sure you’re visible, acclimatise slowly and, if in doubt, stay out of the water.\"\nHe added that swimmers should wear appropriate equipment, including wetsuits for warmth and buoyancy, brightly coloured swim hats, and tow floats to improve visibility and provide something to rest on if needed.\nThe RNLI has also repeated its “Float to Live” advice for anyone who finds themselves in trouble in the water.\n“Tilt your head back with your ears submerged and try to relax,” Mr McLeod explained. “We all float differently, but do as little as possible until help arrives or you’re able to self-rescue.”\nMembers of the public are also being reminded what to do if they see someone else in difficulty.\nThe advice is to remember “Call, Tell, Throw” – call 999 and ask for the Coastguard, tell the person to float on their back if they can, and throw something buoyant such as public rescue equipment.\nThe RNLI warns people not to enter the water themselves unless they have the right training and equipment.",
