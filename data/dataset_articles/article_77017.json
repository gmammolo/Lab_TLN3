  "text": "iPhone 16 Pro Max Price Drops to Rs 1,25,400 at Vijay Sales in India\nBuy iPhone 16 Pro Max at Rs 1,25,400 from Vijay Sales before iPhone 17 release. Includes HDFC bank EMI offer.\nimage for illustrative purpose\nWith the iPhone 17 series expected to debut in September, Apple’s current flagship, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, is being offered at a reduced price through Vijay Sales. The discount applies to both online and physical outlets.\nThe retail price of the iPhone 16 Pro Max is Rs 1,44,900. Vijay Sales is offering a flat Rs 15,000 reduction. Buyers making purchases through HDFC Bank EMI can secure an additional Rs 4,500 discount. Combined, the savings total Rs 19,500, bringing the effective cost to about Rs 1,25,400.\nThe device features Apple Intelligence integration and retains high-end specifications, making it a viable option for those not waiting for the iPhone 17 release.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max includes a triple-camera arrangement with a 48MP main sensor, a 48MP ultra-wide lens, and a 12MP telephoto lens. Video capabilities include AI stabilization and 4K resolution support.\nPowered by Apple’s A18 Pro chip, built using a 3nm fabrication process, the model is designed for improved power efficiency. It incorporates LPDDR5X RAM for enhanced multitasking performance.\nThe smartphone is equipped with a 6.9-inch Super Retina XDR OLED panel, offering a 120Hz refresh rate and peak brightness of 2,000 nits. The titanium frame is available in black, natural, white, and desert titanium variants.\nBloomberg’s Mark Gurman has indicated that Apple’s next launch event may occur on Sept. 9 or Sept. 10, in line with previous release patterns. Apple has not confirmed the date, but September remains the most likely launch window.\nLeaked details suggest that the iPhone 17 Pro may see hardware and design changes, but most software features will remain consistent with the iPhone 16 Pro Max.",
