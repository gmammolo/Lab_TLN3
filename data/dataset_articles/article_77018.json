  "text": "When summer temperatures rise into the upper 90s, both insects and animals become stressed and are affected in ways that may mean life or death.\nWe tend to forget that insects are cold-blooded creatures that depend on outside forces to regulate their body heat. The term for cold-blooded in the insect world is “poikilothermic.”\nAt a temperature of 77 degrees, reproduction is increased, and egg production is high. Many insects can slow down their metabolism to conserve much needed energy for survival.\nDehydration is an enemy to all insect species. During extreme heat insects may find shelter and moisture in homes as they share space with humans.\nCockroaches, for example, slow down reproduction when temps are in the 90s even though they can survive very high temperatures due to their thick exoskeleton. This serves as a layer of protection that can hold moisture in their exoskeleton.\nInterestingly, their exoskeleton can withstand up to 300 times its weight in strength. This would be equivalent to a 200-pound man withstanding the weight of 6,000 pounds.\nBut even with the protection of the exoskeleton, at a temperature of 115 degrees for a prolonged period, death can occur.\nExtreme heat in the 90s and above can also cause yellow jackets, hornets and bees to become more desperate for moisture, making them more likely to sting and become aggressive toward those who get too close. High temperatures increase the metabolism of stinging pests therefore increasing the need for moisture and food.\nSome insects, like the mosquito, thrive during higher temperatures. The high temperatures will kick reproduction into high gear and shorten the time it takes to develop into biting adults as long as there is adequate humidity or moist conditions.\nAnts also become more active and tend to adapt to high temperatures more than most insects while finding needed moisture and protection in the soil.\nThrips are another insect species that thrive in hotter temperatures, especially when lawns are lush and being watered heavily or there is very high humidity.\nHigh temps are certainly uncomfortable for humans, but without high humidity or moisture it can mean certain death for most insect species.",
