  "text": "WhatsApp said Russia was trying to block its services because the social media messaging app owned by Meta Platforms offered people’s right to secure communication, and vowed to continue trying to make encrypted services available in Russia.\nRussia has started restricting some Telegram and WhatsApp calls, accusing the foreign-owned platforms of failing to share information with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases.\n“WhatsApp is private, end-to-end encrypted, and defies government attempts to violate people’s right to secure communication, which is why Russia is trying to block it from over 100 million Russian people,” WhatsApp said in a statement.\nRead: Russia to launch state-backed rival to WhatsApp “We will keep doing all we can to make end-to-end encrypted communication available to people everywhere, including in Russia.” — (c) 2025 Reuters\nGet breaking news from TechCentral on WhatsApp. Sign up here .\nDon’t miss: Big security changes coming to WhatsApp",
