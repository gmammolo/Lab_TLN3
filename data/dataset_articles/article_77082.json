  "text": "KRAFTON has officially announced it will end support for PUBG: Battlegrounds on the PS4 and Xbox One. The transition to exclusively current-generation hardware will take place during the live server maintenance scheduled for November 13, 2025.\nAfter this date, the pioneering battle royale will no longer be playable or downloadable on the older platforms. The move is part of a strategic shift to focus development resources on the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game.\nIn the official announcement , the development team described the decision as a necessary step for the game’s future. “To provide our players with a more stable gameplay environment on console and ensure a smoother, more seamless experience with future updates, we’ve decided to transition to current-gen consoles,” the statement reads. KRAFTON explained that this focus will allow for improved visuals, more stable frame rates, and memory-related optimizations intended to reduce crashes.\n“This was not a decision made lightly,” the team added. “It comes after long and careful consideration, in pursuit of the continued growth and long-term future of PUBG Console.”\nFor the millions of players on last-generation hardware, KRAFTON has confirmed that all account data, including progression and purchased items, will be securely preserved. Players can log in with their existing accounts on a new console and continue without losing their progress.\nThe transition process will differ slightly by platform:\nXbox players with the game installed will be automatically upgraded to the Xbox Series X|S version through the Smart Delivery feature. PlayStation players will need to manually download the native PS5 version of PUBG: Battlegrounds from the PlayStation Store to continue playing after the shutdown date. This marks the end of an era for one of the games that defined the last console generation. PUBG first launched on Xbox One in 2017 and PlayStation 4 in 2018, popularizing the battle royale genre worldwide.",
