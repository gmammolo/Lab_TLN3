This affects an unknown part of the component MACsec Protocol Handler. The manipulation leads to cleartext storage.\nThis vulnerability is uniquely identified as CVE-2025-2182. It is possible to launch the attack on the physical device. There is no exploit available.\nIt is recommended to upgrade the affected component.\nDetails\nA vulnerability was found in Palo Alto Cloud NGFW, PAN-OS and Prisma Access (the affected version unknown). It has been rated as problematic. Affected by this issue is an unknown part of the component MACsec Protocol Handler. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a cleartext storage vulnerability. Using CWE to declare the problem leads to CWE-312. The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere. Impacted is confidentiality. CVE summarizes:\nA problem with the implementation of the MACsec protocol in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS® results in the cleartext exposure of the connectivity association key (CAK). This issue is only applicable to PA-7500 Series devices which are in an NGFW cluster. A user who possesses this key can read messages being sent between devices in a NGFW Cluster. There is no impact in non-clustered firewalls or clusters of firewalls that do not enable MACsec.\nThe advisory is available at security.paloaltonetworks.com. This vulnerability is handled as CVE-2025-2182 since 03/10/2025. The exploitation is known to be easy. Local access is required to approach this attack.
