  "text": "Summary\nA vulnerability was found in tcpreplay 4.5.1 and classified as problematic. This issue affects the function mask_cidr6\nof the file cidr.c of the component tcpprep. The manipulation leads to heap-based overflow.\nThe identification of this vulnerability is CVE-2025-9019. The attack may be initiated remotely. Furthermore, there is an exploit available.\nThe researcher is able to reproduce this with the latest official release 4.5.1 and the current master branch. The code maintainer cannot reproduce this for 4.5.2-beta1. In his reply the maintainer explains that \"[i]n that case, this is a duplicate that was fixed in 4.5.2.\"\nDetails\nA vulnerability has been found in tcpreplay 4.5.1 and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects the function mask_cidr6\nof the file cidr.c of the component tcpprep. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a heap-based overflow vulnerability. The CWE definition for the vulnerability is CWE-122. A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc(). As an impact it is known to affect availability.\nThe advisory is shared for download at github.com. This vulnerability was named CVE-2025-9019. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The attack can be initiated remotely. No form of authentication is required for a successful exploitation. Successful exploitation requires user interaction by the victim. Technical details and also a public exploit are known.\nIt is possible to download the exploit at drive.google.com. It is declared as proof-of-concept. The researcher is able to reproduce this with the latest official release 4.5.1 and the current master branch. The code maintainer cannot reproduce this for 4.5.2-beta1. In his reply the maintainer explains that \"[i]n that case, this is a duplicate that was fixed in 4.5.2.\"\nThere is no information about possible countermeasures known. It may be suggested to replace the affected object with an alternative product.\nAdditional details are provided at github.com.
