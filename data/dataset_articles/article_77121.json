  "text": "Verizon users in Keene and surrounding areas are experiencing widespread service outages. The issue started after a network failure which began early Wednesday morning. According to DownDetector, the outage started around 9.10 AM and has affected mobile data, voice calls, text messaging and wireless home internet services offered by Verizon. Due to the outage the Verizon users in the southwestern New Hampshire region are left without reliable cellular and data services. The DownDetector data reveals that due to the ongoing outage 54% users are facing issues with mobile phone, 24% are experiencing no signal and 22% are unable to access 5G home internet. While Keene is among the hardest hit, other cities such as New York, Atlanta, and Pittsburgh have also seen elevated outage reports Verizon outage: What the company said\nThe Verizon support page shows that the telecom operator is working on a fix. The company has also activated its standard outage notification system to keep affected customers informed of repair progress. Verizon engineers have been working since mid-morning Wednesday to diagnose and resolve the issue. Initial repair estimates were pushed back after crews discovered additional complications. Verizon has advised users to enable Wi-Fi calling on their smartphones to maintain communication while the cellular network remains down. This feature allows calls and texts to be routed through Wi-Fi networks instead of relying on mobile signals. Verizon has not released detailed information about the root cause of the outage, following the company's typical practice of focusing on repair efforts rather than providing extensive technical explanations.
