  "text": "Basically Rubin was supposed to enter mass production later this year amd launch for servers early next year. However because the next AMD Server GPU looks to be more competitive than they expected, it seems they chose to redesign some things and now it looks like mass production will only start next year with only small quantities available by end of next year.\nNVidia's current approach is launch the server GPUs first and gaming GPUs around a year after, so these delays may end up pushing all the stack. I wont be surprised if the 60 series only launches in late 2027 with the new delay.",
