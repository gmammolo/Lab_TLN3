  "text": "Technology & Science\nGoogle Chrome Users In India Are At High Risk Of Hacking, Indian Government Warns: Here's What You Should Do\nCERT-In has alerted users of Google Chrome for Desktop about vulnerabilities that could lead to hacking risks. These vulnerabilities affect versions prior to 139.0.7258/.128 for Windows and MacOS, and 139.0.7258.127 for Linux.\nThe Indian Computer Emergency Response Team of India (CERT-In) has issued a warning for all Google Chrome for Desktop users, as their PC or laptop is at risk of getting hacked. With the latest vulnerabilities detected in Chrome, the attackers can exploit the system by executing arbitrary code, induce a denial of service attack, or even obtain sensitive information related to the users.\nGoogle Chrome Security Alert\nGoogle Vulnerability Details\nFirst things first, the users should know that the versions affected by the vulnerability are Google Chrome versions prior to 139.0.7258/.128 for Windows and MacOS and Google Chrome versions prior to 139.0.7258.127 for Linux. The target audience for the attack is anyone who possesses any of the mentioned versions of Chrome for Desktop on their system.\nAnd yes, there were a total of five vulnerabilities, out of which three were deemed high risk and the other two possessed medium risk. Google worked with multiple security researchers to identify and remove the vulnerabilities in the system.\nThe risks associated with the same suggest that the attackers can get unauthorised access to the sensitive data of the users, which could ultimately lead to data theft. As mentioned by CERT-In, the user can be persuaded by the attacker to visit a specially crafted request on their PC.\nHow To Stay Safe From The Same?\nYou need to get the stable channel update for both Windows and Mac. As for the Linux version, Google has mentioned in an official blog that the stable update will roll out in the coming days. Apart from that, the users should be alert and identify if there is anything wrong with their system or if it is behaving in a strange way. The best practice will be to set Chrome on your PC to automatic updates so that you can get the new version if and when they launch.\nGet\nLatest Newslive on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines fromTechnology Scienceand around the world.End Article\nNishit Singh Raghuwanshi author\nA career journalist who spent six years playing around with smartphones, apps and gaming.
