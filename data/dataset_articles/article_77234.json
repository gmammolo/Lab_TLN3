  "text": "Bending Spoons, the Milan-based technology company behind a roster of globally recognised digital products, has locked in over €500 million in debt financing to accelerate its aggressive acquisition strategy and fortify its position in the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) sector.\nThe raise was led by J.P. Morgan , with BNP Paribas and Crédit Agricole CIB acting as mandated lead arrangers and active bookrunners. A heavyweight syndicate that included BancoBPM, Bank of America, Barclays , Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mizuho, Société Générale, and Wells Fargo also participated.\nThis financing forms part of a broader $600 million debt package spearheaded by Silver Point Capital, a private investment firm specialising in credit and special situations. Other backers include Durable Capital Partners, NB Renaissance, Intesa Sanpaolo, and Cox Enterprises, bringing a deep bench of expertise spanning credit markets, long-term equity, and large-scale corporate growth.\nAggressive acquisitions define the strategy Bending Spoons has raised a total of $1.2B to date and has used this capital to pursue an aggressive acquisition roadmap. In 2025, the company purchased San Francisco-based mileage tracking app MileIQ and completed the $233M all-cash acquisition of U.S. streaming technology company Brightcove. These transactions add to a growing portfolio that includes komoot, Evernote, Issuu, Meetup, Remini, StreamYard, Splice, and WeTransfer.\nLuca Ferrari , co-founder of Bending Spoons, has positioned the company as a long-term operator of the products it acquires, focusing on assets with proven product–market fit. This approach, the company believes, ensures sustainable growth and strong market positioning.\nFuture plans and IPO ambitions On top of the €500M haul, Bending Spoons has also secured an additional €100 million to expand operations further and invest in new technologies. With strong backing from central Italian banks, the company is actively exploring a public listing. However, it acknowledges that scaling at its current pace, in an increasingly competitive landscape, will be a significant challenge.\nStill, insiders say the war chest gives Bending Spoons the ability to move quickly on strategic opportunities in both Europe and the U.S., maintaining its position as one of Europe’s boldest tech consolidators.",
