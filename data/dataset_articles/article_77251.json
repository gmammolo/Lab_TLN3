  "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) promised to revolutionise the field of education. But how, and how much, is it actually being used by students and teachers today? Our recent article sought to answer this question by analysing AI’s integration into universities from two perspectives: scientific (how it is actually being used) and social (perceptions of its use).\nWhile researchers tend to highlight the opportunities and challenges AI presents for personalised learning, social perception tells a different story, reflecting a slower and more uneven adoption, particularly in Europe.\nPersonalisation, virtual tutors and admin In recent years, AI has been steadily rolled out in education , particularly in areas such as personalised learning, virtual tutors and the automation of administrative tasks.\nPlatforms such as Smart Sparrow, Knewton, Century Tech, and Khan Academy use AI to adapt the pace and content of learning to students’ individual needs. These systems use AI to analyse student performance (correct or incorrect answers, response time, error patterns), as well as to automatically adjust the level of difficulty, type of content or pace, and to recommend additional exercises, videos or reading.\nTutoring systems are another use. These are chatbots or virtual assistants that interact with students as a human tutor would. Their typical functions are to answer questions about content, propose exercises, give explanations, solve problems step by step, motivate and accompany the student in their progress.\nSome examples are Khanmigo (Khan Academy + GPT-4), which helps with maths, writing and science, Duolingo Max, an AI for personalised language tutoring, Google’s Socratic, which answers questions with visual explanations, and Carnegie Learning’s Mika, an AI-powered maths tutor.\nAll of these platforms use machine learning models that recognise students’ strengths and weaknesses. This technology is already being used successfully in disciplines such as medicine, electronics and linguistics, where large-scale data analysis and automation are essential for teaching and research.\nThis technology also allows for the efficient management of administrative processes, such as exam correction and tracking grades and performance.\nRead more: AI in universities: How large language models are transforming research\nLimitations and challenges Despite the expectations surrounding AI, its impact on university education remains modest . Globally, its use in universities is still in its infancy, and AI adoption varies greatly between regions and disciplines . While significant progress has been made in some areas, such as health sciences, other areas like the humanities are only just beginning to explore the possibilities of this technology.\nOne of the main challenges is a lack of training for teachers and administrators in the use of AI tools. Many teachers do not have the necessary skills to integrate them into their classrooms, which limits their adoption. In addition, the lack of clear policies on student data privacy and the ethical use of this technology poses significant barriers.\nRead more: AI is now part of our world. Uni graduates should know how to use it responsibly\nEurope lags behind Despite being a leader in regulations on the ethical use of technology, Europe is lagging behind in terms of scientific research on how to integrate it into educational methods.\nThere are exceptions, including the UK, which has very solid research on the ethics of educational AI and adaptive teaching models and automatic assessment. In Germany and the Netherlands, European Union interdisciplinary projects are also combining education, cognitive sciences and computer science.\nThe United States leads in scientific publications, patents, and the development of educational technologies based on AI. Meanwhile in China, there has been a significant increase in publications and applications of educational AI, especially in adaptive learning and facial recognition in smart classrooms. Massive state investment in “Smart Education” is part of its strategy for leadership in AI.\nLatin America (especially Brazil, Chile, and Mexico) also has a growing research output, with advances in adaptive educational platforms and learning data analysis. There is a growing interest in using this technology to reduce educational gaps, and in improving access to it in disadvantaged areas.",
