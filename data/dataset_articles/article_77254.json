  "text": "Viral\nChatGPT Helps Woman Pick 'Best' Watermelon, Internet Says 'We Are Becoming Brain Dead' | VIDEO\nA woman went viral after using ChatGPT to pick the best watermelon. The entire experience, documented in a video, has sparked a conversation among netizens. Some say it’s “genius,” while others expressed that “we are forgetting basic skills.”\nChatGPT Helps Woman Pick 'Best' Watermelon (Image Source - @ravaliabhiram/Instagram)\nBuying fruits and vegetables does require a certain set of skills, but they’re usually basic ones honed through observation and patience over time. However, one woman is going viral for skipping all those tried-and-tested methods and instead turning to AI — specifically ChatGPT — to pick the best watermelon.\nWhile shopping, she found herself standing before a rack piled high with green, striped melons. Rather than selecting one on her own, she took out her phone, snapped a clear photo of the pile, and sent it to ChatGPT. Alongside the image, she typed a simple question: “Which is the best watermelon?\"\nThe chatbot responded with a detailed guide, explaining what to look for — from the skin’s line patterns to spots, size, weight, and even the fruit’s shape. But the woman took it a step further, asking ChatGPT to actually mark the exact melon she should buy. Shortly after, it sent back the same image with an arrow pointing to a watermelon featuring a large yellow patch on its side.\nTrusting the AI’s pick, she took that very melon home — and upon cutting it open, found it to be exactly what she’d hoped for: fresh, bright red, juicy, and sweet.\nSharing her excitement on Instagram, she wrote, “So we asked ChatGPT to pick the best watermelon for us. And it was delivered. We got the sweetest watermelon. No more hitting, checking, talking to your watermelon before picking.\"\nSince being posted, the clip has racked up over 7 million views. Many praised the creative use of AI in such a simple, everyday context.\nOne user commented, “This is a good use of AI and I love it.\"\nAnother wrote, “Genius! Best use case of AI,\" while someone else said, “I love everything about this.\"\nStill, some critics weren’t impressed, calling it “so basic,” with one remarking, “we are forgetting basic skills.” Another wrote, ''we are becoming brain dead.''\nSurbhi Kaul author\nSurbhi Kaul is a journalist at Times Now Digital, currently contributing to the Viral section.
