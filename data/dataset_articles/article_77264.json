But even as mutual distrust grows, the geopolitical rivals are finding it hard to cut ties.\nPhilipp Wolf, Lukas Mäder August 14, 2025\n6 min\nListen\nShare The computer-chip conflict highlights tensions in economic relations between the U.S. and China.

Ihr Browser oder Adblocker verhindert dies momentan.\nBitte passen Sie die Einstellungen an.\nFor the American computer chip industry, a lot of money is at stake. A vast amount of money, in fact. For chip companies Nvidia and AMD, business in China is so lucrative that they are willing to pay a hefty export tax. The two companies have agreed to pay 15% of their future revenues from their business in China to the U.S. government in order to be allowed to continue selling their chips in that country. President Donald Trump referred to the agreement he negotiated as a «little deal.»\nHowever, there are also security concerns in China regarding these American chips. In late July, the Cyberspace Administration of China stated that it was requesting information from Nvidia about its H20 chip, an artificial intelligence chip designed for the Chinese market with the goal of complying with U.S. export restrictions. The agency noted that there have been reports of security issues with Nvidia chips, citing features that reportedly allow the chips to be geographically located and remotely disabled. There is a great deal of mistrust among Chinese policymakers.\nDevelopments over the past two weeks have highlighted the dilemma facing the U.S. and China. Despite their mutual distrust, the two countries are economically dependent on one another. In the race for technological supremacy, exports of modern American semiconductors to China have become a highly political issue – for both sides.\nChina needs American chips In the field of artificial intelligence, China is still heavily dependent on American-made Nvidia chips. At the same time, the U.S. has for some time been seeking to slow down its geopolitical rival's technological advances. For this reason, starting in October 2022, the U.S. administration under President Joe Biden increasingly began restricting exports of high-tech chips to China.\nBut for Nvidia, the Chinese market is too important to ignore. The American company therefore developed the H20 chip specifically for the Chinese market. Experts say it is significantly less powerful than Nvidia's latest models. Under Biden, Chinese buyers were still allowed to import this chip legally.\nWhen Trump started his second term in office in January 2025, he initially allowed the sale of these chips to continue. Then, in April, the White House reversed course, and Trump banned further exports of chips to China – albeit only temporarily, as exports of H20 chips to China have again been permitted since mid-July. Thanks to the 15% cut it will take from Nvidia's sales to China, the U.S. government is now profiting handsomely from this itself.\nThe fact that the export of H20 chips is permitted again is likely to please the many Chinese companies that have invested in this model. Before the export ban went into effect in the spring, Chinese companies are said to have ordered a quantity of H20 chips worth several billion dollars . Comparable chips produced in China are much less popular.\nIt is therefore surprising that the Chinese authorities are now suddenly raising safety concerns about the chips. The fear that American products may contain so-called backdoors – that is, hidden access points that could be used for manipulation or espionage – is not new. Documents leaked by American whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2014 revealed that the U.S. National Security Agency had equipped network devices, such as Cisco routers, with backdoors .\nIn the case of Nvidia chips, the Chinese authorities have spoken of a hidden system that would allow the U.S. to geographically locate a semiconductor and even switch it off remotely. In fact, in May, a Republican senator introduced a bill requiring chips to be equipped with a technical mechanism to verify that they were being exported to the intended country.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has to keep adapting his China business to a dynamic political situation. Brittany Hosea-Small / Reuters The Chinese concerns are likely to relate to this political proposal. However, rather than the H20 chips, that measure would affect the high-tech chips that the U.S. does not allow to be exported to China. Despite the ban, those chips are still finding their way into China illegally.\nThe accusation of American backdoors must therefore be seen in part in the broader context of the tech conflict. The U.S. has repeatedly accused China of using its own products for espionage-related purposes – for example, in the case of mobile phone components from Huawei or, as reported by The New York Times, in the case of port cranes. China wants to counter these accusations with its own narrative.\nThere are companies in China that believe the H20 chip will bring them economic success. At the same time, the Chinese authorities harbor a deep mistrust of Western technology in general. China's government administration will soon be limited to using domestically produced IT solutions , for example.\nMoreover, the Chinese government has been promoting domestic chip production for the last 10 years. This sector is facing considerable difficulties . However, it seems plausible that China will increasingly seek to avoid using American chips going forward, at least once comparable domestic alternatives have become available.\nBetween security policy and trade ambitions In the U.S., concerns about Chinese products have grown significantly in recent years. Proponents of strict export controls on chips ground their arguments in part in national security concerns. Every American chip exported could contribute to the modernization of the Chinese military, they say, or at least promote the technological advancement of the Chinese regime. Thus, they do not want the U.S. to supply China with technologies that are superior to Chinese solutions.\nWith the ban on the H20 chip in April, it seemed as if Trump was once again tightening the country's export policy. Whether this is actually the case remains unclear following the latest easing of restrictions. Trump probably sees in the chip sector what he sees in everything: an opportunity to make deals.\nHowever, not all observers agree that the delivery of American chips actually helps China. There are also advocates of liberal practices in the United States who argue that every chip that Nvidia sells in China helps the company maintain or even expand its market-dominating position. Nvidia's presence in China is also preventing competitive alternatives from emerging there, they note, adding that this will consolidate U.S. technological superiority.\nSeeking a modus vivendi The chip conflict highlights the broader dilemma facing the U.S. and China. For security reasons, it would be advisable for both countries to weaken their economic ties. Yet, from an economic point of view, this is extremely difficult and brings considerable disadvantages.\nThe back-and-forth over export licenses, security concerns and mutual accusations are the result of the difficulty in decoupling economic relations between the countries. It remains to be seen how Trump will approach this process and whether he will ultimately change the course of U.S. policies toward China. For its part, China also still appears to be seeking a path toward compromise.\nIn the best-case scenario, the latest developments would lead to a modus vivendi in trade relations between the two countries, which are already political opponents but still economic partners. However, things could also turn out differently, with Beijing or Washington opting for a hard line and seeking to decouple economic relations altogether. That would solve the dilemma – but it would also mean the end of a lucrative business relationship.\nLatest articles Three takes on Trump's tariff deal with the EU Georg Häsler, Peter A.
