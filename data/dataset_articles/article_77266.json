  "text": "DeepSeek’s much-anticipated R2 AI model was supposed to arrive in May, ready to challenge industry giants. Instead, it’s stuck in limbo because, reportedly, there were issues that forced the delay.\nTraining bottlenecks with Huawei’s Ascend chip have thrown the schedule off track and raised bigger questions about whether China’s AI ambitions can outrun its hardware limits. DeepSeek needs this update, and they need it badly; that’s why we can see some big updates coming soon.\nLet’s explore the topic to understand what’s going on with DeepSeek’s new model delay:\nAlso read:\nAfter launching R1 in January, Chinese authorities nudged the company to ditch Nvidia chips in favour of homegrown Huawei hardware. The idea looked brilliant on paper, cutting ties with U.S. tech and boosting self-reliance. In practice, it’s been a grind of technical glitches and delays.\nHuawei’s Ascend processors were supposed to be DeepSeek’s ticket to independence from U.S. tech. Instead, they became the biggest obstacle in training its R2 model. During the training phase, the chips struggled with performance bottlenecks and compatibility glitches, derailing every attempt at a full-scale run. The setback forced DeepSeek to return to Nvidia GPUs for training, relegating Huawei’s hardware to lighter inference tasks.\nHuawei didn’t just watch from the sidelines. Its engineers flew in to work alongside DeepSeek’s team, tweaking systems and running diagnostics. But even with their expertise, the setup never achieved a stable training session. The mission now is to make Ascend chips reliable for inference, though that journey is still far from over.\nThe real winners in AI will be the teams that share strategic independence along with technical excellence, ensuring that chip choice accelerates, rather than hinders, progress. For developers, the message is clear: in the race to build smarter AI, the smartest move might be picking the right silicon from the start.\nAlso read:\nTraining bottlenecks with Huawei’s Ascend chip have thrown the schedule off track and raised bigger questions about whether China’s AI ambitions can outrun its hardware limits. DeepSeek needs this update, and they need it badly; that’s why we can see some big updates coming soon.\nLet’s explore the topic to understand what’s going on with DeepSeek’s new model delay:\nAlso read:\nInside GPT-5: OpenAI’s bold step towards an advanced AI futureWhat is the latest DeepSeek model?\nIn March 2025, DeepSeek released a powerful new update: DeepSeek-V3-0324. While it uses the same Base model as DeepSeek-V3, the post-training pipeline has been improved, drawing lessons from the RL technique in DeepSeek-R1.What is the new AI after DeepSeek?\nManus, an AI agent generally considered more advanced than a chatbot, can do everything from analysing the stock market to making a personalised travel book.Which model of DeepSeek is the best?\nSelecting the right model between DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 depends on what you aim to achieve with our tasks or projects. My general recommended workflow for most tasks is to use V3 and switch to R1 if you get into a loop where V3 can't find an answer.What is better, DeepSeek-R1 or V3?\nDeepSeek R1 and V3 are both strong and quite powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) from DeepSeek, but they shine in different areas. DeepSeek R1 is better for tasks where complex reasoning is needed along with logical thinking and problem-solving, while DeepSeek V3 is faster and more efficient for general-purpose language tasks like writing, summarisation, and basic coding. The best model for you depends on your specific needs and priorities.DeepSeek’s R2 dream hits a chip-shaped snag!\nDeepSeek’s next AI model, R2, was set to roll out in May, but that plan has slammed into a wall. The culprit? Training hiccups with Huawei’s Ascend processor. It could be a big blow to the AI tech giant, whose aspirations are to replace some of its big AI players.After launching R1 in January, Chinese authorities nudged the company to ditch Nvidia chips in favour of homegrown Huawei hardware. The idea looked brilliant on paper, cutting ties with U.S. tech and boosting self-reliance. In practice, it’s been a grind of technical glitches and delays.\nInside the chip battle that stalled DeepSeek’s R2!\nHuawei didn’t just watch from the sidelines. Its engineers flew in to work alongside DeepSeek’s team, tweaking systems and running diagnostics. But even with their expertise, the setup never achieved a stable training session. The mission now is to make Ascend chips reliable for inference, though that journey is still far from over.\nFinal Words:\nThe DeepSeek–Huawei roadblock is a reminder that in AI, hardware isn’t just a tool, it’s the foundation. It's as important as any big update or change in the technical aspect of the AI technology. Pressure may push companies to seek alternatives, but swapping out proven systems for untested ones can stall innovation.The real winners in AI will be the teams that share strategic independence along with technical excellence, ensuring that chip choice accelerates, rather than hinders, progress. For developers, the message is clear: in the race to build smarter AI, the smartest move might be picking the right silicon from the start.\nAlso read:",
