  "text": "Is Dying Light: The Beast Crossplay?\nIs Dying Light: The Beast crossplay? Short answer: No, crossplay isn’t supported right now. Kind of disappointing, honestly—I was hoping this time, Techland would let PlayStation and Xbox fans finally jump rooftop-to-rooftop together.\nUser @Hazieon expressed disappointment that Dying Light: The Beast lacks crossplay, noting it would have been a welcome feature for the game.\nSo, if your best zombie-slaying buddy is on a different console, you’ll be waving at them from the other side of the apocalypse (or texting them to buy the same system). While Dying Light 2 had its share of multiplayer quirks, The Beast keeps multiplayer within the console or platform family—you’re either all in with PS5, or all in with the PC horde, but never at the same table.\nI get why game studios play it cautious; cross-platform features can sometimes feel like wrangling zombies in a windstorm. But in 2025, with half of Discord screaming “just give us crossplay,” you can’t help but feel Techland is missing an easy win.\nDying Light: The Beast Release Date\nRelease date? Dying Light: The Beast launches worldwide on September 19, 2025. That’s a Friday, which means you get a full weekend to ignore homework, cancel plans, and soak in those moody nighttime parkour chases.\nI still remember the original Dying Light drop—camped out on launch day, microwave pizza balancing in one hand, controller in the other, ready to panic every time the sun set in-game. There’s something delicious about that first day nervousness, especially when you know everyone else is right there with you, dying repeatedly and loving it.\nHow to Get Dying Light: The Beast Pre-Order?\nYou want to secure your copy? Dying Light: The Beast preorders are live now—and honestly, it’s pretty easy. Head to your favorite storefront (PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, Steam, or Epic Games Store) and you’ll see the Standard, Deluxe, and Collector’s Editions lined up like loot in an abandoned safe house.\nHere’s my informal guide:\n-\nDigital Preorder: Quickest way, gets you instant goodies. Usually includes bonus items, character skins, or XP boosters if you’re the “fashion over function” type.\n-\nPhysical Copy: If you’re old school (and want that big Collector’s box for your shelf), hit up retailers to snag bonuses like steelbooks or exclusive posters.\n-\nTiming matters: Sometimes, early birds nab limited skins or weapon blueprints, so don’t snooze if you want to flex in the first week.\nHonestly, there’s a bit of joy in logging in launch day, decked out in preorder gear, and getting at least 18 minutes of feeling invincible before a zombie throws you off a balcony.\nThe official @DyingLightGame account described Dying Light: The Beast as elevating primal brutality with intense combat and fierce finishers, promising an even more visceral gameplay experience.",
