  "text": "A lot has been uncovered on the so-called 'Frankenstein' rabbits that were discovered in Colorado recently.\nThe horrifying sight has caught the eyes of those on social media for all the wrong reasons, with their 'face tentacles' stealing headlines in particular.\nSince being photographed in the US and shared online, panic spread like wildfire, with many pet owners and locals worrying about the severity of the condition and how it would affect them.\nIn all fairness, it might be one of the most disturbing animal-related sights you'll ever lay your eyes on.\nAdvert\nPeople on Reddit claimed that they'd 'freak out' if they saw these herbivores, and even compared the sight to something you would see in a 'nightmare'.\nIt has since been revealed that these rabbits are suffering from a particular virus called Cottontail Rabbit Papillomavirus (CRPV), but what is it, and can we contract it?\nWhat causes CRPV?\nCottontail Rabbit Papillomavirus was discovered on cottontail rabbits in the American Midwest in 1933, and it also came to be known as Shope papilloma virus.\nAdvert\nThey can be found on the skin of rabbits, as papilloma virus can lead to squamous cell carcinomas developing, which is also known as cancer.\nAccording to Pet MD, the 'raised, red, and rough' lesions can sprout from their ears, eyelids, neck, shoulders, abdomen, thighs, or even the feet, though they develop into black tumours.\nIt is understood by scientists that the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks and other biting insects, though it can also be passed between rabbits.\nThe virus can also be passed via bedding, as well as food and water bowls. CRPV can be passed through blood transfusion too - though this is far less likely.\nHow dangerous is CRPV?\nWhen it comes to pet rabbits, cases are rare, but they aren't impossible.\nAdvert\nAny rabbit can pass it to any other rabbit, wild or domestic, and those pesky creepy-crawlies can't be stopped when they want to be a nuisance, unfortunately.\nThe summertime is also the season for them to thrive, so it's worth monitoring your bouncy friends, if you have one.\nLuckily though, wild cottontail rabbits, the species most affected, are found in the US midwest.\nWith that being said, brush rabbits, black-tailed jackrabbits, snowshoe hares, European rabbits, and domestic rabbits could be affected too, though chances are lower.\nVetlexicon states that the virus simply 'does not occur in the UK or Europe', but better to be safe than sorry and all that.\nAdvert\nCan it spread to humans?\nIt's the million pound question, and luckily, CRPV is a non-zootonic disease.\nThis means that it won't pass between animals and humans, though this doesn't mean you should go around touching these lesions.\nIn case we all forgot, non-zootonic diseases can mutate - just cast your mind back a few years to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdvert\nWLBT3 report that it's important to steer clear of rabbits with these black tentacles coming out of their bodies, as nobody really wants anything like that sticking out of their own bodies.\nColorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) have echoed this same sentiment, regardless of how curious you may be.",
