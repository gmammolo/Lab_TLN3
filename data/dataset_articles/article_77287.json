  "text": "Colorado wildlife officials are urging calm after a spate of unusual sightings, rabbits with dark, horn-like growths sprouting from their heads and faces, has stirred public unease and speculation online. While experts say the condition, known as cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV), is not currently transmissible to humans, some epidemiologists are warning that close monitoring is essential to guard against any future spillover.The disease, spread by biting insects such as mosquitoes and fleas, causes grotesque, wart-like tumors on infected rabbits. In recent days, residents across Northern Colorado have reported seeing the animals in alarming numbers, sometimes with growths obstructing their vision or mouths.Although CRPV has been documented for decades and is considered largely benign in wild rabbit populations, veterinary virologists note that papillomaviruses have a history of evolving. In rare cases, similar animal viruses have jumped species barriers, raising questions about whether climate change, urban expansion, and surging insect populations could create conditions for mutation.Possible impacts on domestic animalsThe virus is more dangerous for domesticated rabbits, where it can cause malignant tumors. Pet owners are advised to keep rabbits indoors if infected wildlife are present nearby and to seek veterinary care immediately if symptoms appear.There is currently no vaccine or treatment for CRPV, either for wild or domestic rabbits. Colorado wildlife officials stress that the public should avoid touching, feeding, or attempting to capture the infected animals.For now, the official message remains clear to keep your distance, protect your pets, and let scientists do their work.FAQsWhat is the horned rabbit virus?The horned rabbit virus, formally known as cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV), is a wildlife disease that causes wart-like or horn-like growths on rabbits’ heads and faces.Can the horned rabbit virus infect humans?Currently, there is no evidence that CRPV can infect humans or most household pets. Scientists say it is species-specific, but they continue to monitor for potential mutations.How does the virus spread?CRPV spreads mainly through biting insects such as mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks, making infections more common in warmer months.",
