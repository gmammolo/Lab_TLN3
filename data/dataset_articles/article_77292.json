  "text": "Deepfake UPI frauds: An understanding Deepfake UPI scams are cyber fraudsters using artificial intelligence to create fake audio or video that convincingly resembles a real person's face, voice, or body language. Scammers often use these faked outtakes to impersonate family members, friends, or even business executives to request instant money transfers via UPI. Because the voice and images look real, the victims may bypass their usual verification process, making it easier for fraudsters to quickly transfer funds. How criminals conduct these scams The attackers normally begin with gathering available photos, videos, or voice recordings of the victim on social media, online profiles, or video calls. Then, they use AI-based software to create realistic-sounding fake videos or audio. The attacker makes a video call on messaging app or social media with the victim, posing as a person they know, and provides a reason for an urgent payment. They normally display a UPI QR code or payment link, leveraging the emotional reaction of the victim so that rational checks can be bypassed. Warning signs to watch out for Even the most sophisticated deepfakes will contain minute flaws. Watch for abnormal face movements, lip-sync problems, or irregular blinking. For voice deepfakes, you may detect strange pauses, robotic-sounding voice, or off-key background noises. Be wary if the individual is demanding cash payment immediately without allowing you to authenticate, or if they demand keeping the exchange private. Another flag is receiving a call from a new or unknown number while presenting yourself as a known individual. Preventive steps for individuals Verify the person's identity twice before handing over any money, especially for high-urgency transactions, with an independent mode of communication—such as calling their registered number or checking in person. Share as little personal data, photos, and videos online as possible to make it harder for criminal syndicates to create realistic deepfakes. Use strict privacy settings on social media and enable additional verification steps within your UPI app, such as app-based PINs or biometrics, to discourage unauthorized transactions. The role of awareness and reporting Sensitizing colleagues, relatives, and friends about the dangers of deepfakes can make them less prone to deepfake fraud. If you are sure that you have been targeted or are the victim of a deepfake UPI fraud, report to your bank's fraud helpline and the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (cybercrime.gov.in) simultaneously. The earlier it is reported, the more likely you are to freeze the fraud transactions and trace the origin. Being proactive not only protects yourself but also others as it makes it possible for the authorities to trace evolving fraud patterns. FAQs Q1: Can deepfakes circumvent the security aspects of UPI? Yes, deepfakes target the human component of trust, forcing you to perform a transaction yourself. While UPI systems are safe, social engineering can lead to losses. Q2: How do I know if a payment request for a video call is legitimate? Always hang up the call and contact the person through his/her known number or email and confirm the request before making any payment. Q3: Are there legal actions against deepfake creators in India? Yes, creating or employing deepfakes for cheating is illegal under the Information Technology Act and Indian Penal Code and can lead to imprisonment and fines.\",",
