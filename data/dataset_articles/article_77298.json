  "text": "TikTok is one of the most used social media apps in the United States of America. According to the TikTok CEO's statement in January 2024, the app has about 170 million monthly active users in the states.However, a recent update in the app's guidelines seems to have many upset with its policies and the future of budding creators on the app. In a decision to improve user experience, TikTok updated its guidelines to allow only five hashtags per post. “Hashtags help create and foster online communities, providing a sense of belonging among users with shared interests. Brands can use them to encourage user interaction and generate conversations,” it added.But users of the app are of the thought that the update could negatively affect their views and engagement, and thus took to social media to share their disappointment. Netizens react to the new TikTok update Image credits: XPeople who use the app as a source of life and income depend on their engagement and views. For them, limiting the number of hashtags seems to be directly related to limiting reach, and thus, they don't seem to be happy with the app's new update.\\\"IT SUCKS SO MUCH \\\"more efficient tagging for more views\\\" THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS I CAN TAG TO GET MY NORMAL REACH 💔💔💔\\",
