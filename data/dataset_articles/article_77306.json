  "text": "The National Payments Corporation of India has announced important changes in the rules of UPI. The peer-to-peer collect request feature will be discontinued from October 1, 2025, which was increasing the possibilities of fraud. From now on, users will have to resort to QR code or contact number for UPI payments.\nUPI Payments Rule Change: Since the advent of UPI, the culture of cash has almost ended in India. Now everyone makes online payments through UPI apps like Phonepe, GooglePay or PayTm. If you also do the same, then know that NPCI i.e. National Payments Corporation of India has issued new rules for UPI. According to these changed rules, a very commonly used feature peer-to-peer (P2P) “collect request” will be removed on UPI apps from October 1, 2025.\nWhat is P2P Collect Request feature?\nLet us tell you that with the help of P2P Collect Request feature, a user could request payment from another UPI user. After this, the other user accepts the request and makes the payment by entering his UPI PIN. For some time, this feature was being used more for fraud. After this, now NPCI has decided to remove this feature from UPI apps. This means that now users using UPI apps will not be able to make payments on someone’s request.\nHow was the fraud done?\nThose who commit fraud through UPI apps used to use this P2P collect request feature a lot. Through this, they used to send money requests to the user by telling fake identity or fake emergency. After this, the user used to accept that request and his entire account used to be emptied. Despite the limit of Rs 2,000 on this feature, people were being cheated in many cases.\nWhat will happen next?\nNow from October 1, this feature will not be visible on UPI apps. If you have to make payment through UPI apps, then you will have to scan the QR code or select the contact number for this. Without this, UPI payment will not be possible through any third method. Experts believe that this will lead to a huge decline in cases of fraud with UPI users.\nThese services will not be affected\nIf you are thinking that you will not be able to make UPI payment even if the merchant requests payment for making an online payment, then it is not so. Merchant services like Flipkart, Amazon, Swiggy, IRCTC will not be affected. By using them, you will be able to send collection requests as before. After this, you will have to accept the request and make the payment by entering the UPI PIN.",
