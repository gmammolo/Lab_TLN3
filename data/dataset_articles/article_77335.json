  "title": "Japan's PC Gaming Population Drops by 3 Million Over Past Decade - GamerBraves",
  "text": "Japan’s PC gaming population has shrunk significantly over the past ten years, according to new data from Famitsu’s annual gaming industry report . The 2025 edition of the Famitsu Game Hakusho shows that PC gamers in Japan decreased from 17.49 million in 2015 to 14.52 million in 2024 – a drop of nearly 3 million players.\nDespite the PC gaming decline, Japan’s overall game market continues to grow. The market expanded by 3.4% between 2023 and 2024, reaching 2,396 billion yen (over $16 billion USD). The total gaming population, which includes console, PC, and mobile players aged 5 to 59, was 54.7 million people in 2024, slightly down from 55.5 million the previous year.\nImage Credit: Famitsu Mobile gaming dominates Japan’s gaming landscape with 42.77 million users, followed by console gaming at 29.51 million users. PC gaming ranks third with 14.52 million users. It’s important to note that these numbers overlap since many players use multiple platforms. While PC gaming saw a small increase in 2024 compared to 2023’s 14.45 million users, the numbers remain far below the 2015 peak. In fact, PC gaming hit an even higher point in 2014 with 20.37 million users.\nThe trend over the past decade shows clear winners and losers. Console gaming grew from 26.12 million to 29.51 million users, while mobile gaming exploded from 14.11 million to 42.77 million users. PC gaming moved in the opposite direction, losing those 3 million players. The data shows Japan’s gaming preferences shifting toward mobile platforms, while PC gaming struggles to regain its former popularity despite the global growth of platforms like Steam.",
