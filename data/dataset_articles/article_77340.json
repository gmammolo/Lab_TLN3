  "text": "Your Microsoft 365 subscription becomes a worse deal the longer you use it. A single year of Microsoft 365 costs $99.99 at minimum, and you’re never done paying for it. Alternatively, a Microsoft Office lifetime license for Mac is now only $69.97 (reg. $219).\nThis is Microsoft Office Home and Business for Mac 2021. It’s a little different from Microsoft 365. The apps are a little older, but that can actually be a good thing. It means a random update won’t completely change your workflow. It also means random AI suggestions won’t pop up all the time trying to tell you how to do your job.\nThis license comes with lifetime access to\n- Word\n- Excel\n- PowerPoint\n- Outlook\n- Teams (basic)\n- OneNote (free version)\nYou can install these apps on one Mac, and then that’s it. You can use them for personal tasks, work, or school. Security updates are also still included.\nIf you don’t want to pay $99.99 every year indefinitely, here’s your way out.\nRight now, it’s only $69.97 to get Microsoft Office for life.\nMicrosoft Office Home & Business for Mac 2021: Lifetime LicenseSee Deal\nStackSocial prices subject to change.",
