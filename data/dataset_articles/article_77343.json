  "text": "Veteran Australian rock outfit Crowded House have been the subject of a baffling AI-generated video hoax, with the group issuing a brief statement dispelling the claims made by the clip. Kid Cudi Didn't Want to Testify in Diddy Trial, But 'I Knew I Was Helping Cassie' Crowded House shared the video in question to their Facebook page on Saturday (Aug. 9), with the clip featuring AI renditions of TVNZ journalist Simon Dallow and frontman Neil Finn discussing the false claim the musician had fathered a child at the age of 67. “I never thought I’d be able to become a father again,” Finn can be heard saying, albeit with an improper accent. “Honestly, I believe that chapter of my life was closed, not because I didn’t want it, but because I simply couldn’t.” As the video unfolds, it becomes clear it was created to promote treatment for men suffering from erectile dysfunction. “For years I lived with a problem most men are too ashamed to talk about,” the AI avatar continued. “No desire, no confidence, no control. I was too embarrassed to even talk to my wife about it.” The three-minute video concludes with the fake version of Finn even claiming that his desire to speak out in regards to his apparent plight had previously resulted in threats, adding: “I won’t stay silent because I see how men are reclaiming their lives.” Crowded House’s response to the clip was concise, urging fans not to believe any of the claims made in the clip. “We’re not sure where this came from but please don’t be fooled,” the band wrote. “Neil’s never had trouble with erections.” Notably, this isn’t the first time that Dallow had been involved in AI-generated video hoaxes, with a 2023 incident seeing the veteran journalist included in a fake video promoting gambling apps. Tyler, The Creator Has Had Enough of Timothée Chalamet in Fiery 'Marty Supreme' Trailer: Watch “We are seeing a proliferation of this type of scam material online and we are dealing with this content on a weekly basis,” a spokesperson for TVNZ said at the time. “These fake stories and scam advertisements are a fabrication. “Our presenters’ images are used without permission, the quotes are made up and there is no legitimate endorsement or genuine association.” The group’s brush with AI-generated nonsense comes just days after they announced a series of pop-up dates in their native Australia this October and November. The tour follows the band’s sold-out 2024 run in support of their eighth studio album Gravity Stairs , and marks another chapter in a storied career spanning nearly four decades. Crowded House have sold more than 15 million records globally, with their self-titled 1986 debut spawning classics like “Don’t Dream It’s Over” and “Something So Strong.” The band has received 13 ARIA Awards, a Brit Award, and an MTV VMA, and has been streamed billions of times. Fronted by Finn and co-founder Nick Seymour, the band’s current lineup came together in 2020 and released Dreamers Are Waiting in 2021. Finn’s 2018 stint with Fleetwood Mac introduced him to a new generation of fans before returning to lead Crowded House into a new era. Charli xcx Explains Why People Are 'Envious' of Addison Rae",
