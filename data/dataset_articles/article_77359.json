  "text": "AKIPRESS.COM - A technical glitch in Uzbekistan's Tax Committee database led to the unauthorized withdrawal of about 400 billion soums (over $30 million) from citizens' accounts.\nThe relevant notices for the return of the funds have been sent to the treasury. The money is being gradually returned to taxpayers, the Tax Committee said. Funds had been returned to 20,600 people as of 6 pm on August 14.\nThe error occurred in the electronic tax services system (my3.soliq.uz), affecting 30,100 taxpayers. Over 10,000 individuals had sums ranging from 100,000 soums ($7.94) to 1 million soums ($79.89) debited from their accounts, the Committe noted.",
