  "text": "THE eThekwini Municipality said that it is investigating an error on its mobile App which resulted in a delay in resolving a resident’s complaint.\nThe municipality’s spokesperson Gugu Sisilana said the “root cause of this error” is being probed “to prevent a recurrence”.\nThis follows Waterfall resident Anthony Drimmie’s complaint about non-functional or broken streetlights on his road which he lodged on June 25 via the municipality’s mobile App.\nJust over a month later, nothing had been done about the streetlights, which prompted a frustrated Drimmie to contact the Highway Mail.\nDrimmie said four streetlights on the road they reside on were broken and that after lodging the complaint on the App, he received a reference number and a two to 24 hours time frame to rectify the issue.\nAlso read: Councillor urges residents to report broken streetlights\nSisilana said the municipality “extends its sincere apologies to” Drimmie and added that an unfortunate “technical system error” resulted with this resident’s reference number being “incorrectly linked in our database to a different street”.\n“This meant that the customer’s fault report was not flagged for action in the correct location, resulting in a delay in service. A technician has now been dispatched to carry out the necessary repairs. We are investigating the root cause of this error to prevent a recurrence. We would like to assure residents that this should not discourage them from using the city’s updated mobile App and other available platforms to report faults,” said Sisilana.\nOn Tuesday, Drimmie confirmed that technicians had begun working on the streetlights and thanked the Highway Mail for its intervention.\nDrimmie had contacted the Highway Mail in response to an article about the municipality’s PR councillor urging residents to make use of the mobile App to report service delivery issues.\nHe had questioned why residents should make use of the App when there was a delay with his complaint which he had lodged just over a month prior.\nFor more from the Highway Mail, follow us on Facebook , X and Instagram.
