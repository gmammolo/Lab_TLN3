  "text": "Social media messaging app WhatsApp has alleged that Russia was trying to block its services, saying that the Meta-owned platform protects people’s right to secure communication, and it has vowed to continue making encrypted services...\n\"WhatsApp is private, end-to-end encrypted, and defies government attempts to violate people's right to secure communication, which is why Russia is trying to block it from over 100 million Russian people,\"",
