  "text": "Key Points: Authorities deny Jing Yaping’s involvement in Bitcoin mining. No recorded impact on cryptocurrencies reported. Official dismissed allegations as AI-generated rumor. The Guizhou Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection debunked claims that former Big Data Bureau director Jing Yaping mined 327 Bitcoins, confirming the case did not involve cryptocurrency.\nThis clarification averts potential misinformation impacts on the cryptocurrency market, underscoring the importance of verifying reports from credible, official sources.\nAuthorities Refute AI-Generated Bitcoin Mining Allegations Allegations surfaced claiming that Jing Yaping, former director of Guizhou’s Big Data Bureau, used government resources to mine Bitcoins. The commission for discipline inspection denies these claims, stating her case was unrelated to cryptocurrency. These accusations originated from unverified online sources, later identified as AI-generated content.\nThe Chinese authorities’ response, denying any mining activities, underscores the state’s strong stance against misinformation and improper use of government resources. As a staff member from the Publicity Department of the Guizhou Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision confirmed, “the news that Jing Yaping used a government server to mine 327 bitcoins was ‘a rumor.’ According to their understanding, Jing Yaping’s case did not involve bitcoin.”\nKey figures in the crypto industry, such as major exchange CEOs and regulation experts, have yet to comment publicly on this case. Official dismissal of the rumors stresses the importance of verifying sources in news, especially related to crypto assets.\nMisinformation in Crypto: A Call for Vigilance Did you know? Reports of officials engaging in unauthorized crypto mining have arisen before, yet China’s crackdown remains steadfast with no similar precedent matching Jing Yaping’s alleged scale.\nBitcoin (BTC) is currently valued at $123,141.18, as reported by CoinMarketCap . The trading volume over the last 24 hours reached $96.12 billion, reflecting a 28.03% increase. Bitcoin’s price has risen by 3.14% in the past 24 hours, maintaining a dominant market share of 58.61%.\nBitcoin(BTC), daily chart, screenshot on CoinMarketCap at 04:56 UTC on August 14, 2025.

The spread of misinformation in crypto is a challenge both for authorities and investors aiming to maintain a stable market environment.
