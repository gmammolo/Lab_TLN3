  "text": "A study led by the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) has discovered that sex reversal—a phenomenon in which an individual displays the physical characteristics of one sex but the genetic makeup of the other—is more common in wild birds than previously thought, which could have significant consequences for threatened species.\nThe research, published in the journal Biology Letters, analyzed nearly 500 specimens from five Australian species—including magpies, kookaburras, pigeons, and lorikeets—and found that up to 6% of the birds examined showed this discrepancy between their genetic sex and their physical or reproductive traits.\nThis indicates that sex determination in wild birds is more flexible than we believed and can persist into adulthood, explained Associate Professor Dominique Potvin, co-author of the study.\nThe specimens, which had been admitted to wildlife hospitals in southeastern Queensland for injuries or illnesses unrelated to the study, were examined post-mortem. The researchers identified their reproductive organs and then analyzed their DNA to determine their genetic sex.\nThe researchers found that 92% of the birds with sex reversal were genetically female but had male reproductive organs. In addition, they documented an exceptional case: a genetically male kookaburra that nevertheless had large ovarian follicles and a distended oviduct, indicating that it had recently produced eggs.\nAlthough sex reversal is a known phenomenon in fish, amphibians, and reptiles, it has rarely been observed in wild birds and mammals. This study establishes a foundation for understanding its prevalence in Australian bird populations and its possible causes.\nAccording to lead author Dr. Clancy Hall, the presence of individuals with sex reversal could affect the reproductive success of wild populations, especially in already threatened species. This can lead to unbalanced sex ratios, reductions in population size, changes in mating preferences, and even demographic declines, warned Hall, who conducted the study as part of her doctoral research at UniSC.\nThe phenomenon also calls into question traditional methods for determining the sex of birds, such as analyzing genetic markers, plumage, or behavior. We have shown that DNA does not always reflect an individual’s actual sex, Hall noted. Many researchers take genetic samples from blood or feathers and assume the result is definitive, but this could be wrong in up to 6% of cases.\nFor the study, birds with sex reversal were classified into three categories: genetically male with a completely female phenotype, genetically female with a completely male phenotype, and those showing a combination of testicular and ovarian characteristics.\nThe exact causes of sex reversal in birds remain unclear, although the researchers suggest that environmental factors—such as exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals or elevated stress hormone levels—could be influencing sexual development.\nOne revealing detail was that the genetically male but reproductively active kookaburra was found in a peri-urban agricultural area, where such contaminants often accumulate.\nThe research team, which included ecologist Dr. Gabriel Conroy, microbiologist Dr. Martina Jelocnik, and doctoral candidate Vasilli Kasimov, emphasizes the need for further studies to understand the environmental triggers and the long-term impact on vulnerable species.\nUnderstanding how and why sex reversal occurs is crucial both for conservation and for improving accuracy in ornithological studies, Potvin concluded.\nThe study raises new questions about how human activity—and its side effects on ecosystems—might be altering fundamental biological processes in species that, until now, were considered less susceptible to such changes.\nSOURCES\nUniversity of the Sunshine Coast\nHall Clancy A., Conroy Gabriel, et al., Prevalence and implications of sex reversal in free-living birds.
