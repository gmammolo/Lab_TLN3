  "text": "Business Insider tells the global tech, finance, stock market, media, economy, lifestyle, real estate, AI and innovative stories you want to know.\nA team of researchers gave AI bots their own social platform — and it turned toxic.The chatbots split into cliques and boosted the most partisan voices. A handful of 'influencers' also quickly dominated the conversation, according to a study published last Tuesday by researchers at the University of Amsterdam.The researchers built a minimal social network with no ads, no recommended posts, and no algorithm deciding what users see.\nThe researchers also tested six interventions meant to break the polarization loop, including a chronological feed, downranking viral content, hiding follower counts, hiding user bios, and amplifying opposing views.None solved the problem. 'While several showed moderate positive effects, none fully addressed the core pathologies, and improvements in one dimension often came at the cost of worsening another,' the researchers said.\nUnited States Latest News, United States Headlines\nSimilar News:You can also read news stories similar to this one that we have collected from other news sources.\n– Unfinished Business Review: It’s Great to Be Back in BusinessRoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business is a great standalone expansion that capitalizes on what the previous game did well.\nRead more »\nMenopause Hormone Therapy Boosts GLP-1 Drug Effectiveness, Researchers SayGood news for women of a certain age: Hormone replacement therapy for menopause appears to boost the effectiveness of GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound, a new study says.\nRead more »\nSome CU Boulder Researchers Concerned as Climate Change Website Goes DarkAnusha Roy is the weekday morning anchor for Denver7.\nRead more »\nFormer Top Google Researchers Have Made a New Kind of AI AgentThe mission?
