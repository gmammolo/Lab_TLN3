  "text": "Network Outage Hits Multiple Agencies\nBy Barbara Hoberock, Oklahoma Voice\nOKLAHOMA CITY – Some state agencies closed early Tuesday following a network outage.\nThe Office of Management and Enterprise Services in a message to stakeholders said it was investigating network service issues statewide affecting multiple agencies.\nThe office was working on a resolution, the message said.\n“We are currently investigating and have determined this as not a breach of state systems,” said Christa Helfrey, OMES spokeswoman. “Each agency determines its work schedule and when to adjust daily operations.”\nBy late afternoon Tuesday, the outage had been resolved.\nThe Oklahoma Department of Labor and Oklahoma Ethics Commission closed early, according to the agencies.\nThe Oklahoma Department of Corrections sent administrative staff home early, said Kay Thompson, a spokeswoman.\nDepartment of Corrections facilities saw minimal disruptions, she said.\nTuesday was election day for 22 counties.\n“It is not impacting our elections today,” said Misha Mohr, a spokeswoman.\nThe Pardon and Parole Board was not able to connect with DOC facilities where inmates were scheduled to make personal appearances, said Tom Bates, executive director.\nBut the agency was able to continue with its business because attorneys were able to speak on the offenders’ behalf, he said.\nSome staff at the Oklahoma Attorney General’s office went home early to continue working, said Phil Bacharach, a spokesman.\nThe outage did cause delays in some of the agency’s work, he said.\nEditor’s note: This story was updated at 4:20 p.m. Tuesday to indicate the outage had been resolved.",
