  "text": "(Image credit: EA) In terms of numbers, it'd be hard to argue that the first Battlefield 6 beta weekend was anything other than a success. At times, the beta attracted more than half a million concurrent Steam players —enough to beat Call of Duty's peak player count record since 2022. Our Morgan Park was impressed enough to declare that 2025 is Battlefield's year to lose .\nBut as you'd expect for a beta test, the enthusiasm came with some caveats. Throughout the weekend, frustrated players said their enjoyment of the tank shelling and shotgunning festivities was being interrupted by the so-called \"super bullet\": They'd be in a firefight where they were sinking rounds into an enemy, only to die immediately when they took what seemed like one shot in return.\nDoes something feel off about this game? from r/Battlefield On the Battlefield subreddit, beta feedback threads mention kill time inconsistency, with some players noting that \"TTK feels fine, but the 'Time to death' can feel instantaneous.\" Anecdotally, I experienced the issue throughout my beta playtime: I'd hear a single, lethal thwip and drop dead, but my post-death damage log would show that I'd taken five or six hits. That disparity has led players to speculate there's a bullet damage desync happening somewhere between the game client and multiplayer server.\nRelated Articles\nThe Battlefield 6 beta probably is running worse for you this time around: 'We'll follow up with additional updates as soon as possible'\nThe Battlefield subreddit is an endless feed of leaked Battlefield 6 gameplay, and it might be the best marketing campaign of 2025\nPeople are flipping out over recoil in Battlefield 6 because of one gun specifically designed to have no recoil in real life That's assuming, of course, that it's not just a skill issue that we're all trying to rationalize.\nThankfully, Battlefield 6 devs have provided some hope for our collective self-esteem: Yesterday, Dice principal gameplay designer Florian Le Bihan said on X that Battlefield Studios is collecting evidence of the super bullet phenomenon for investigation (via GamesRadar ).\npic.twitter.com/XIXuZPVFUy August 11, 2025\n\"If some of you have some video examples of suspected super bullet / unexpectedly fast TTD that you've recorded in the Battlefield 6 Open Beta - send my way,\" Le Bihan tweeted .\nIn his replies, you can find some clips that pretty clearly indicate something is up. The videos from users @FINAL1DY and @benbit13 are most representative of my experience: Before they're even able to pull their sights up, they've been casually deleted by what looks like one bullet that the game's treating as four.",
