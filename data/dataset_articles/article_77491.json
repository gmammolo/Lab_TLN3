  "text": "AOL, a web portal and online service provider, formerly known as America Online, has decided to discontinue its Dial-up Internet services. The online service provider from America has confirmed that its service will be stopped on September 30. According to the official confirmation from AOL, the service will no longer be available in AOL Plans, and the change will not affect any other benefits in your AOL plan. The decision from AOL has marked an end for a program that brought millions of Americans online for the first time.\nAOL is Pulling The Plug on Dial-Up Internet Service After a Long 30 Years AOL is the company that introduced and brought the internet to the people in the 1990s and early 2000s. The company recently posted a notice on its support site that they are pulling the plug on its dial-up internet service on September 30.\nAOL announced that it routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet. It stated that this service would no longer be available in AOL plans. As a result, it would discontinue this service and the associated software, the AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser, which were optimized for older operating systems and dial-up internet connections, on September 30, 2025. They also added that the change would not affect any other benefits in users’ AOL plans, which they could access at any time on their AOL plan dashboard.\nA spokesperson from AOL stated that they were discontinuing the dial-up internet service component included in certain legacy AOL Advantage, CompuServe, and Netscape Connect Plans as they innovated to meet the needs of today’s digital landscape. He added that this change did not impact the numerous other valued products and services that those subscribers were able to access and enjoy as part of their plans. The spokesperson also mentioned that there was no impact on their users’ free AOL email accounts.\nAOL, formerly known as America Online, connected many households to the World Wide Web (www) for the first time when its soon to be shut down dial-up internet service was launched decades ago. America Online was well known for its free trial discs, which were a common item that seemed to be everywhere in the 1990s in the United States. The name American Online was changed to AOL in 2006. Verizon, a large American telecommunications company, sold both AOL and Yahoo to Apollo Global Management, a private equity firm, in 2021, and the deal was worth around $5 billion.\nAlso Read: Why Nvidia & AMD are Paying the U.S. 15% of China Chip Revenue – for the First Time\nAOL’s Journey: A Complete Walkthrough AOL, America’s one of the ideal and best web portals and online service providers, began its journey in 1985 as Quantum Computer Services. The company was later rebranded to America Online in 1991. It grew and rose to prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s; the company managed to provide an early internet experience for millions of users in America. AOL’s aggressive marketing and techniques, like widely distribution of trial CDs, the introduction of countless households to email, chat rooms, and the World Wide Web, made the firm one of the most recognized service providers at the time.\nIn 2000, AOL’s market value skyrocketed to nearly $164 billion. The company was at its peak and became stronger with the acquisition of Time Warner in 2001. After some years, the journey of AOL started to weaken with the introduction of broadband internet, which offers significantly faster speeds than dial-up.\nThe rise of broadband internet posed a significant challenge to AOL’s business model, and the struggled to maintain its market share as consumers shifted from dial-up service to broadband internet. AOL’s subscriber base started to decline in the middle of the 2000s. AOL was later acquired by Verizon Communications in 2015 with the aim of the potential revival of the company. Verizon integrated AOL’s media brands and advertising technology with its advanced media ventures.\nIn 2021, Verizon sold AOL and Yahoo to Apollo Global Management, and the deal further pushed AOL away from internet services and started to emphasize content and advertising. These sales started to shake the identity and ideology of AOL and ultimately initiated the downfall of the company.\nOn September 30, 2025, the company will mark its end of an era by officially discontinuing its dial-up internet service. This will mark the end of the nostalgic era for many users, and the company will be remembered as the one that played a revolutionary role in shaping the digital world. However, the company is planning to discontinue its dial-up internet service; it will continue to provide its free email service, along with other products like identity protection and technical support",
