  "text": "Hong Kong’s consumer watchdog recorded 17,000 complaints linked to online shopping last year, accounting for about 40 per cent of all cases, with problems including an inability to return products, delays that caused fines and loss of packages.\\nThe Consumer Council also revealed on Thursday that 148 online shopping complaints related to logistics services were received between January and July in 2024, which nearly doubled to 279 this year over the same period.\\nOne such complaint involved a defective computer monitor, valued at 1,650 yuan (US$230), that could not be returned, despite the mainland Chinese e-commerce platform advertising a local return service in Hong Kong.\\nThe complainant initially brought the product back to the logistics provider’s service point in Fo Tan as per the local return policy and received her HK$72 delivery fee refund. But she was told her product was “ineligible” for local return service, prompting her to file a complaint with the platform.\\nUpon the intervention of the council, a refund was issued, with the whole process taking 2½ months.\\nAnother complaint was due to a lag between the sending and receiving times of a mobile text message, which resulted in a late fee for the customer despite collecting the package from a self-pickup locker within the designated time frame of 24 hours.\\nThe council said the complainant received a text message from a courier at 12.27pm on January 1 to collect her package that she picked up at 12.14pm the next day but was still charged a late fee of HK$10.\\n\\nShe sought the council’s help after her complaint to the courier was not addressed. It was revealed that the fine was a result of the courier’s system recording the text message as being sent at 10.47am, with the firm acknowledging the technical issue and offering a refund for the late fee.\\nIn a separate case, a customer was told that the items in his 270 yuan (HK$295) package had already been picked up when he visited the collection point after receiving a confirmation of its arrival from a logistics company.\\nHe lodged a complaint with the council after observing how packages at this self-pickup point, which managed items for multiple logistic providers, appeared to be unattended in a back alley accessible to passers-by.\\nHe raised concerns about the verification procedure of customer identity and inadequate security. Upon the intervention of the council and the confirmation of the loss of the package from the logistics company, a full refund was issued.\\nThe watchdog urged the industry to review its operations to ensure they met service commitments, as disputes could undermine consumer confidence.\\nFrancis Ho Ying-fu, deputy chief executive of the council, said the success rate of resolving cases related to online shopping logistics services was about 50 to 60 per cent over the years.\\nHo stopped short of revealing the companies involved in the cases the council had dealt with.\\n“Once products involve cross-border online shopping, customers should understand the clauses and conditions involved, and whether there is protection, such as whether terms apply in Hong Kong,” he said.\\n“If disputes arise, unless the terms stipulate that they can be dealt with in Hong Kong, they’d have to be handled according to the regulations of the place of origin of the company, and could be difficult for customers to follow up.”\\nAccording to Ho, the council would refer cases related to e-commerce platforms to consumer organisations on the mainland to follow up, which had a success rate of about 70 to 80 per cent. The rate for European and US cases was not high, he added.\\n",
