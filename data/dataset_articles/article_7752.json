  "text": "Severe weather disrupted sea transportation between Istanbul and Bursa on Thursday morning, forcing the cancellation of multiple ferry services operated by Istanbul Deniz Otobusleri (Istanbul Sea Buses, IDO) and Bursa Deniz Otobusleri (Bursa Sea Buses, BUDO).\nMeteorological authorities had issued advance warnings for strong winds and heavy rainfall.\nThe storm reached the Marmara Sea early on Jan. 8 and caused widespread disruption to maritime transport.\nAccording to official announcements, several high-speed ferry services scheduled for the morning hours did not operate due to adverse weather conditions.\nBUDO said on its website that the following routes were cancelled:\nMudanya is a coastal district of Bursa, while Kabatas is a major ferry terminal on Istanbul’s European side.\nThe operator also cancelled additional services connecting Bursa, Istanbul, and Armutlu later in the day:\nArmutlu is a coastal town in Yalova province, located on the southern coast of the Marmara Sea.\nIstanbul Deniz Otobusleri also confirmed that some of its scheduled ferry services were cancelled due to the storm, though it did not publish a detailed list of affected sailings in its initial notice.\nThe storm also affected local maritime transportation within Istanbul.\nAuthorities confirmed that some services operated by Sehir Hatlari, Istanbul’s municipal ferry network, did not operate on Thursday morning.\nThis included disruptions on island ferry routes, which connect the city to the Princes’ Islands in the Sea of Marmara.\nPassengers were advised to follow official operator announcements and check updated schedules before traveling, as further cancellations may occur depending on weather conditions.",
