  "text": "WhatsApp has accused Russia of attempting to block its services, citing the app’s commitment to secure, end-to-end encrypted communication. The Meta-owned platform pledged to continue efforts to make its encrypted services accessible across the country.\nThe Russian authorities have reportedly begun restricting certain Telegram and WhatsApp calls, alleging that foreign-owned platforms have failed to share information with law enforcement in cases of fraud and terrorism.\n“WhatsApp is private, end-to-end encrypted, and defies government attempts to violate people’s right to secure communication, which is why Russia is trying to block it from over 100 million Russian people,” WhatsApp said in a statement. “We will keep doing all we can to make end-to-end encrypted communication available to people everywhere, including in Russia.”\nTelegram, meanwhile, confirmed that its moderators are using AI tools to monitor public areas of the platform, removing millions of harmful messages daily. “Telegram actively combats harmful use of its platform including calls for sabotage or violence and fraud,” the company said.\nRussia has long clashed with foreign tech companies over content and data storage, a dispute that escalated following Moscow’s military actions in Ukraine in February 2022. Critics argue that the moves reflect Russia’s broader push to tighten control over its internet landscape.\nReuters",
