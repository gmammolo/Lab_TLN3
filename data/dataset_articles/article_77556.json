  "text": "A woman who bought a 2023 Hyundai Palisade took it in for a minor repair. Now she says the dealership is telling her she needs a whole new car.\nShe’s afraid they’re trying to scam her.\nCreator Savannah Dixen ( @savannahdixen ) shared her story on TikTok this weekend.\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox, daily. back Sign up For more information, read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use . “I need someone to tell me if the dealership is trying to scam me into a new car,” Dixen begins.\nShe says she bought a used 2023 Hyundai Palisade Limited a year ago with roughly 26,000 miles on it. Now it has 45,700 miles.\nOver the past year, Dixen says she’s had three separate electrical outages where the car shut off. This has led to issues with the locks, windows, dashboard, lights, moonroof, and opening the doors.\nEach time Dixen has taken the Palisade to the dealership, they’ve purportedly told her, “we can’t find a code for it, we can’t help you.” The dealership allegedly also informed her that this issue will keep happening until there is a code to fix it.\n“Now I’m nervous. Last time this happened, I was driving and everything went out, and I had to pull over.” Dixen shares.\nShe claims the dealership's proposed solution is for her to buy a new car. Dixen says they’re trying to get her into a 2025 Hyundai .\n“I feel like the dealership is trying to screw me into buying a brand new car,” she concludes.\nDo You Really Need A Code to Fix It?\n“Is there anything I can do? Is the dealership trying to screw me?” Dixen asks.\nSome said she should take the car to another dealership or autoshop. Others agree that she should trade the Palisade in.\nThe top comment suggests, “1. Go to another dealership. 2. Don’t tell them about this issue, since it’s not obvious. 3. Trade that in for a more reliable SUV. Stay away from Hyundai and GMC.”\n“The dealer isn’t scamming you. The issue has to occur for the dealer to find the fix,” another added.\nSomeone who describes themself as a Hyundai employee suggested that it’s not the dealership’s fault.\n“I work for a Hyundai dealer and the warranty requires codes. If there are no codes and it can’t be replicated, the warranty unfortunately will not cover it,” they wrote. “This is standard protocol. The next time it happens, record what is happening, call the dealer and have it towed to them so they can be present when it’s happening and they can have a chance to diagnose it.”\nOther drivers on Reddit , Quora , and CarTalk forums have also faced issues with dealerships not fixing the issues without a code.\n“‘We can’t duplicate the issue’ is the standard reply, even when they’ve seen the issue frequently and know what it is. They likely have to get permission to do the work,” one Redditor claimed.\nElectrical issues are often tricky to fix. Without a code or being able to replicate the issue, the dealership's mechanics often won’t touch it.\nThis is why many people suggested Dixen take her Hyundai to an independent repair shop.\nCan She File a Claim Under the Lemon Law? Lemon laws protect car buyers in case a vehicle is unsafe and unable to be fixed within a reasonable number of attempts and time.\nEach state has its own version of the lemon law, so whether you’re able to get relief will depend on the law of the land in your jurisdiction.\nIn Dixen’s case, Washington does not apply its lemon law to used vehicles. So, although her Palisade is a 2023, which most would consider relatively new, because she bought it used, Dixen likely doesn’t have recourse under the lemon law.\nDixen says she’s filed a claim with Hyundai Consumer Affairs, and the company wants to analyze the car internally.\nMotor1 has contacted Dixen via email. This story will be updated if she responds.\nShare this Story Got a tip for us? Email: tips@motor1.com\nJoin the conversation ( )",
