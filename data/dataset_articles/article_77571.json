  "text": "Citing multiple sources, Reuters reported on the 13th (local time) that the U.S. is secretly planting location tracking devices in cargo to prevent the smuggling of AI chips shipped overseas into China. It has even introduced an unusual method to capture the flow of advanced AI chips into areas subject to U.S. export regulations.\nAfter the investigation by the U.S. authorities, the location tracking device will be attached only to certain cargoes. Reuters evaluated, \"It shows how intense the U.S. is to enforce chip export regulations.\"\nAccording to sources, the installation of the location tracking device is mainly involved by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industrial Security (BIS). The Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are also participating. It is a pan-governmental move to prevent the flow of advanced U.S. AI chips into China. U.S. authorities are using the information obtained by the tracker to prosecute companies and individuals who violate export controls. However, it has not been confirmed when the U.S. authorities began wearing location trackers after the implementation of export controls for advanced AI chips to China in 2022.\nIn industrial sites, location tracking devices are said to be used as open secrets. Reuters reported that five officials involved in the supply chain of AI servers knew that location tracking devices were installed in server cargo manufactured by Dell and Super Microcomputer. The server includes chips manufactured by Nvidia and AMD.\nThere were also detailed testimonies. Some officials told Reuters that last year, among the Dell server cargoes containing Nvidia chips, there were cases where the server itself had a small location tracker as well as delivery boxes and internal packaging. It is also reported that resellers remove location tracking devices from Dell and super microcomputer servers to divert advanced AI chips. The server and chip manufacturers mentioned did not say they did not know about the existence of the location tracking device or made any special comments. However, Nvidia told Reuters, \"We do not install secret tracking devices on our products.\"\nThe war of nerves between the United States and China over the import and export of AI chips is currently ongoing. Earlier last month, the U.S. Donald Trump administration and Congress drew backlash from China when they mentioned asking their companies to install a location check function on AI chips being exported. In addition, on the 31st of the same month, China's National Internet Information Office (CAC) raised concerns about Nvidia's \"H20\" chip, which is allowed to be sold in China, and demanded that the company submit evidence.\n[Reporter Choi Hyunjae]",
