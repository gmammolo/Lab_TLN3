Please read the offering circular at invest.deathandcompany.com.\nJoin the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\nWhat’s going on here?\nAmara Raja Energy and Mobility’s quarterly profit slid 21% to 1.94 billion rupees ($22.2 million), with sluggish car sales and rising costs weighing on the battery maker—even as it gears up for electric vehicles.\nWhat does this mean?\nBest known for its Amaron car batteries, Amara Raja is feeling the squeeze from weak auto demand and climbing expenses. Revenue ticked up 7% to 33.5 billion rupees, but much of that was fueled by customers swapping out old batteries instead of carmakers ordering for new vehicles. Meanwhile, costs climbed even faster—up 10%—with analysts highlighting pricier energy bills that further squeezed margins. The company’s performance mirrors broader struggles among India’s traditional battery makers as the auto industry gradually pivots to electric mobility. Still, Amara Raja is investing in the shift, building a battery cell factory and assembling electric vehicle battery packs to better tap India’s growing EV market by 2027.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Margins under pressure in a changing landscape.\nAmara Raja’s profit dip spotlights the challenges legacy suppliers face as India’s auto scene slowly goes electric. Sales are inching upward, but higher input and energy costs are squeezing profits. Meanwhile, rival Exide is managing its bottom line more tightly, setting up an industry face-off as margins come under pressure. Investors will be watching which players can control costs and adapt as new technologies remake the sector.\nThe bigger picture: Electrification is rewriting the battery rulebook.\nIndia’s electric vehicle momentum is changing the game for battery makers. Amara Raja’s push to expand cell manufacturing and EV battery packs signals a bid for longer-term growth—even as profits are pinched by short-term troubles. With batteries central to India’s clean energy ambitions, firms that pivot quickly and keep costs in check could shape the future face of the industry.\nBut if you could see the long-term signals before they made mainstream news, you’d stand a better chance of finding a revolutionary opportunity early.\nEnter, Investors Lab from Science News.
