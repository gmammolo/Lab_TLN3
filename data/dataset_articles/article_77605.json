  "text": "Apple anticipates releasing iOS 26 next month, introducing video playback support for CarPlay, a feature accessible only when vehicles are stationary and contingent upon automaker activation. This update also includes redesigned icons and appearance options for CarPlay, along with widget support.\nThe upcoming iOS 26 will enable applications to display videos on CarPlay screens, a functionality restricted to instances when the vehicle is parked. This feature requires explicit enablement by individual automakers; it will not be universally active by default upon the iOS 26 release. Consequently, some manufacturers may not implement the support, or their rollouts could be significantly delayed.\nBeyond video playback, iOS 26 will implement redesigned icons and new appearance options for CarPlay. The update also incorporates support for widgets and introduces enhancements to the Music and Messages applications. These particular updates do not necessitate specific approval from car manufacturers and are expected to be available in September.\nCarPlay Ultra, a more advanced iteration of CarPlay, was initially announced in May in conjunction with Aston Martin. Future support for CarPlay Ultra is projected to extend to vehicles from Kia, Hyundai, Porsche, Genesis, Ford, Nissan, Infiniti, Jaguar, and Honda. However, several manufacturers, including BMW, Mercedes, Volvo, Polestar, Renault, and General Motors, are not expected to integrate CarPlay Ultra into their vehicles.",
