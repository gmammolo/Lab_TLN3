QRIS simplified existing payment processes, while Payment ID attempts to create a unified financial identity system linked to national ID numbers.\nPayment ID requires extensive regulatory frameworks under Indonesia’s Personal Data Protection Law and must address privacy concerns that simpler payment systems avoid 2.\nThe extended timeline reflects the technical and regulatory challenges of building systems that aggregate data across multiple financial institutions while maintaining user consent and privacy protections.\nPayment ID addresses a specific structural problem in Indonesia’s economy where many small businesses cannot access formal banking due to lack of credit history.\nBank Indonesia officials explicitly cited this challenge, noting that “UMKM kita sekarang banyak yang enggak bisa akses ke perbankan karena perbankan enggak tahu siapa mereka” (many of our MSMEs cannot access banking because banks don’t know who they are).\nThe system aims to create comprehensive financial profiles that could enable banks to assess creditworthiness for previously “invisible” small businesses.\nThis approach differs from traditional credit scoring by potentially capturing informal economy transactions through digital payment data, giving banks visibility into previously undocumented cash flows.\nThe pilot program’s focus on social assistance distribution in Banyuwangi serves as a testing ground for verifying financial identities, which could later support MSME credit assessments.\nPlease check the strength of your internet connection and try again",
