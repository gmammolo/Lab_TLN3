  "text": "Several projects that were winners in the first two auction rounds of the European Hydrogen Bank (EHB) — a leading support measure for EU green hydrogen — have dropped out of the funding process. While some reshuffling was expected — the EHB has a reserve list — industry players say the withdrawals highlight underlying problems facing the sector and point to a need for more flexibility in the EHB rules, especially around operational deadlines for projects. Three projects out of 21 that were selected in the first two rounds — awarded in April 2024 and February 2025 — have dropped out, with 18 remaining.\nPolicy\nEuropean Hydrogen Bank Rules Too Strict for Some\nCopyright © 2025\nEnergy Intelligence GroupAll rights reserved.
