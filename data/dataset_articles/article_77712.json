  "title": "Windtree Therapeutics Faces Potential Nasdaq Delisting After 77% Stock Drop Amid BNB Treasury Strategy",
  "text": "Windtree delisting occurred after Nasdaq notified the company it failed to meet Listing Rule 5550(a)(2)’s $1.00 minimum bid requirement; WINT shares plunged roughly 77% to $0.11 and Nasdaq will suspend trading, per Windtree’s SEC filing. Investors should review filings and monitor the company’s continued disclosures.\n-\nNasdaq delisting notice: failure to meet $1.00 minimum bid under Listing Rule 5550(a)(2)\n-\nWINT share drop: fell ~77.2% to $0.11 and declined further in after-hours trading (Google Finance).\n-\nCorporate actions: announced BNB treasury, $60M purchase agreement, $500M equity line and $20M stock‑purchase pact.\nWindtree delisting: WINT plunged after Nasdaq delisting notice. Read SEC filing details, BNB treasury impact, timelines and next steps for investors — stay informed now.\nWhat is the Windtree delisting?\nWindtree delisting refers to Nasdaq’s notification that Windtree Therapeutics (WINT) failed to maintain the minimum $1.00 bid price required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), triggering a delisting process and a scheduled trading suspension. The company disclosed the notice in an SEC filing and said it will continue periodic reporting.\nHow large was the market reaction and what are the immediate trading effects?\nWINT shares dropped approximately 77.2% to $0.11 on the delisting announcement and fell a further ~4.7% in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance. Nasdaq has set a suspension of WINT trading effective Thursday; the filing and market data outline the immediate impact for shareholders.\nWindtree’s decline followed a brief run-up in mid‑July after announcing a BNB treasury strategy. The stock surged after the July 16 announcement but has since fallen more than 90% from its July 18 peak.\nWINT’s change in share price on Wednesday. Source: Google Finance\nHow did Windtree’s BNB treasury announcements affect investor sentiment?\nWindtree disclosed a BNB treasury strategy on July 16 that included a $60 million purchase agreement with Build and Build Corp and options for an additional $140 million. Market optimism briefly lifted WINT shares by 32.2% over two days, but the rally reversed sharply.\nThe company later announced a $500 million equity line of credit with an unnamed investor and a separate $20 million stock‑purchase pact with Build and Build Corp to acquire more BNB tokens. Windtree has not publicly detailed the amount of BNB it holds or its ongoing treasury allocation strategy.\nWill Windtree continue reporting after delisting?\nYes. CEO Jed Latkin stated in the SEC filing that Windtree will maintain its reporting obligations despite the Nasdaq delisting notice. Companies can continue SEC reporting and may pursue corrective steps to regain listing, as seen previously with other firms.\nHistorically, some companies suspended by Nasdaq — for example, Argo Blockchain — have been relisted after meeting compliance requirements, while others pivot to OTC markets or restructure. Investors should follow filings and official company statements for updates.\nWhat does the broader crypto market context show?\nBNB itself rose 5.6% to $876.26 on Wednesday, recording a new all‑time high as the wider crypto market rebounded from a two‑week low, according to CoinGecko data. BNB is among a small set of large altcoins making cycle highs alongside XRP and Solana, while others lag behind 2021 peaks.\nReports and market trackers cited: Google Finance, CoinGecko, and public SEC filings.
