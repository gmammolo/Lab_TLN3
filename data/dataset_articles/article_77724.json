  "text": "Electrolyte imbalance refers to altered electrolyte levels that predominantly affect DM patients due to hyperglycemia which rise plasma osmolality and impaired renal function, and cause a change in electrolyte level. Hence this study aimed to evaluate the Prevalence and Determinants of Electrolyte Abnormality among good glycemic control and poor glycemic control Adult Diabetic Patients at Wolkite University specialized hospital (WUSH) from May 8 to July 25, 2024. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted at the outpatient department of WUSH. A total of 216 participants were selected using a systematic random sampling method. The data were coded and entered into EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 21. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors. Out of 216 enrolled DM patients, 132 (61.1%) had uncontrolled blood sugar levels. The overall prevalence of EI among diabetic patients was 75% (162/216) (95% CI: 68.7–80.6%), with 109 cases (50.5%) observed among patients with uncontrolled DM and 53 cases (24.5%) among those with controlled DM. Hyponatremia was the most common EI (39.8%), followed by hypocalcemia (25.9%) and hypochloremia (25.0%). Factors significantly associated with EI included a DM duration of ≥5 years (AOR = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.21–5.90), hypertension (AOR = 3.40, 95% CI: 1.49–7.76), impaired eGFR (AOR = 6.55, 95% CI: 1.48–28.88), and uncontrolled DM (AOR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.30–5.16). Patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus are at a higher risk of developing electrolyte imbalances compared to those with controlled DM. Among these imbalances, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, and hypochloremia are the most commonly observed and are particularly prevalent in individuals with poorly managed diabetes.",
