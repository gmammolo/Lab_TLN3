  "title": "Ola Electric shares fall 5% after a 29% surge in 2 days, VAHAN data concerns investors",
  "text": "Shares of Ola Electric Mobility Ltd. slipped nearly 5% in Thursday’s trade after a sharp 29% rally over the previous two sessions. The stock, which surged 9% on Tuesday and another 20% on Wednesday to hit a three-month high, is now facing pressure as investors turn cautious following the release of the latest VAHAN registration data .\nAccording to VAHAN, Ola Electric recorded 9,522 registrations as of August 20 , trailing behind rival Ather Energy , which posted 10,248 registrations. If the trend continues, Ola Electric’s market share could slip below Ather’s, raising concerns about competitive positioning in the fast-growing EV two-wheeler market.\nThe recent rally was accompanied by record trading volumes , with over 111 crore shares changing hands on August 20. However, only about 17% of these were delivery-based trades—the lowest delivery ratio in four months—suggesting speculative participation rather than long-term buying.\nBrokerages remain divided on the stock. Out of six tracking Ola Electric, two recommend a “Buy” , two suggest “Sell” , and the rest remain “Neutral” . Target prices range from ₹63 at the high end to ₹40 on the lower side .\nEarlier, Ola Electric reported mixed Q1 FY26 earnings . While losses narrowed and revenues improved compared to the previous quarter, the company still posted weaker results than the same period last year. Gross margins, however, improved significantly—up 1,100 bps sequentially to 26% . Management has guided for full-year gross margins in the 35–40% range and expects its auto business to turn EBITDA positive from Q2, with full-year EBITDA crossing 5% .\nThe stock’s sharp run-up and subsequent correction reflect investor concerns that operational data, particularly EV registrations, may not fully support the recent surge.",
