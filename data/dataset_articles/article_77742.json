Arctic Sea Ice Melt Slows After Decades Of Decline: Researchers say natural ocean patterns have temporarily balanced rising global heat. But this “reprieve” won’t last — melting could soon accelerate at double speed. UK Inflation Jumps Above Forecasts: Annual prices rose 3.8% in July, driven by food and air fares. The spike dims hopes for more rate cuts this year and points to higher rail fares in 2026. OpenAI Eyes Record Valuation: The ChatGPT maker may raise $6B in a stock sale that would push its value to $500B, overtaking SpaceX as the world’s most valuable private company. Featured ESG Tool of the Week:\nKlimado – Navigating climate complexity just got easier. Klimado offers a user-friendly platform for tracking local and global environmental shifts, making it an essential tool for climate-aware individuals and organizations. Palantir Shares Slide 15% in Five Days as AI Hype Fades Palantir’s stock fell 9% on Tuesday , marking the fifth straight day of losses and wiping out more than 15% in a week after recently hitting record highs. The AI data analytics giant, founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel and Alex Karp , powers decision-making for governments and businesses through its Gotham and Foundry platforms. But despite strong earnings earlier this month, a short-seller for Citron Research warned that Palantir is “disconnected from fundamentals,” saying its price already bakes in success far beyond reality. Once built for U.S. intelligence, Palantir’s tech now spans over 40 industries — from national security to healthcare and finance. Still, the selloff shows that even Silicon Valley’s most hyped AI players aren’t immune to investor doubts.\n***\nArctic Sea Ice Melt Slows Dramatically — But Scientists Warn It’s Only a Pause\nIce in Arctic sea is slowing in melting down. Photo Credit: Jonathan Cooper Scientists have reported a surprising slowdown in Arctic sea ice melt over the past 20 years, with no significant decline since 2005. The finding is puzzling because global emissions and warming have continued to rise. Researchers believe natural swings in ocean currents temporarily reduced the amount of warm water entering the Arctic, slowing the melt. But they stress this is only a short-lived pause — within the next 5–10 years, sea ice loss is expected to accelerate again, possibly at double the long-term rate . Since 1979, the Arctic has already lost about half its summer sea ice area , while ice thickness continues to fall. Scientists warn that ice-free conditions are still likely this century, threatening Arctic wildlife and fueling global heating. The message remains clear: climate change is real, human-driven, and urgent.\n***\nFurther reading: Dramatic slowdown in melting of Arctic sea ice surprises scientists\nUK Inflation Jumps to 3.8% on Food and Travel Costs, Cutting Hopes for Rate Relief\nInflation in UK is going crazy. Photo Credit: Shutter Speed UK inflation rose to 3.8% in July , higher than expected and the 10th straight month above the Bank of England’s 2% target . The increase was fueled by higher food prices — up 4.9% year on year — and a sharp 30% rise in air fares due to summer holiday demand. Petrol also added pressure, while droughts in southern Europe pushed up fruit and vegetable costs. The jump makes another interest rate cut unlikely in 2025 , with financial markets not expecting one before spring. Rail fares in England are also set to climb 5.8% next year , as they are tied to inflation readings. Analysts warn that rising prices could fuel wage demands, leaving the government in a tough spot with unions. Despite this, experts still expect inflation to fall back to target by late 2026.\n***\nFurther reading: UK inflation rises by more than expected to 3.8% amid higher food prices",
