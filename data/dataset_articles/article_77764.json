  "text": "- NASA Watch\n- August 5, 2025\nOIG Finds Flaws In NASA’s Standing Review Board Process\nKeith’s note: According to this NASA OIG report NASA’s Standing Review Board Practices: “Standing Review Boards (SRB) conduct independent assessments of programs and projects and offer recommendations to improve performance and reduce risk. However, the SRB process lacks Agency-level oversight, improved SRB composition and training can add greater value to the assessments, improvements are needed to ensure adequacy of SRB engagement and accuracy of information provided to decision-makers, and the SRB process does not adequately capture lessons learned.”\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.",
