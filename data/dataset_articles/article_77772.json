  "text": "An unknown number of workers, including some executives, are allegedly expected to leave.\nIt appears Meta's AI initiatives may be facing the same turbulence that affected the company's push for metaverse in the first half of the 2020s, with a recent report claiming the tech giant has quietly reorganized its AI division, planning to lay off some of the employees as a result.\nDrew Angerer/Getty\nAccording to the NYT, citing two people familiar with the matter, Meta issued an internal announcement earlier this week about dividing Meta Superintelligence Labs, the company's AI department, into four distinct groups: one for AI research, one focused on \"superintelligence,\" one handling data centers and other AI-related hardware, and one dedicated to products.\nAs a result, the sources say, the AI division, which employs thousands of people, may be downsized, with an undisclosed number of employees, including some executives, expected to be cut or moved to other departments. The report notes that discussions are still ongoing and no final decisions on the downsizing have been made.\nThe NYT insiders add that the reorganization is intended to better structure Meta to accelerate progress toward superintelligence and speed up the development of AI-related products in order to stay competitive.\nRead the original report here and don't forget to join our 80 Level Talent platform and our new Discord server, follow us on Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Telegram, TikTok, and Threads, where we share breakdowns, the latest news, awesome artworks, and more.",
