  "text": "In recent months, AI has dominated headlines, with Donald Trump’s AI plan, the phased rollout of the EU’s AI Act, and a fresh wave of corporate lobbying to stall new rules.\nCompetitiveness, growth, red tape, risk, innovation, productivity. Buzzwords swirled around Brussels in a bid to define the future of AI regulation.\nWhen August arrived, the political noise faded into the summer recess, but AI is continuing to shape real-world decisions, and the consequences are already here.\nAI isn't just about potential growth, innovation or future risk. In retail finance, AI risks have become a reality. The sector is among the most active adopters of AI in the EU, these systems are already deciding who gets a loan, how much people pay for insurance, and whether they have access to a bank account.\nAnd while the AI Act will close some gaps in the rules, many will remain, leaving everyday banking, insurance and investment decisions in the hands of opaque models with too little oversight.\nAcross Europe, consumers are being cut off from basic banking, not because of fraud or wrongdoing, but because algorithms flag them as risky.\nMany of these closures are triggered by semi-automated anti-money laundering tools that rely on incomplete or inaccurate data.\nOnce flagged, customers often face account freezes with no explanation and no clear way to appeal. These closures are not trivial. Customers report being abruptly cut off, unable to receive salaries, pay rent, or access public services.\nCredit scoring tells a similar story.\nAI systems often assess creditworthiness using large volumes of personal and behavioural data, from spending habits to digital activity, but the logic behind these assessments is opaque, and the outcomes can be deeply unfair.\nA borrower might be denied a loan not because they can’t repay it, but because the AI blackbox flags their digital footprint as “risky.”\nAnd these systems are prone to produce false positives that hit vulnerable consumers hardest, such as migrants and people with low incomes.\nAI-driven profiling practices also shape decisions in insurance, where 50 percent of non-life insurers in the EU already use AI.\nThe current rulebook is inadequate.\nLayered sectoral laws predate the widespread use of AI and fail to capture the harm caused by opaque decision-making.\nThe EU’s flagship AI Act is meant to do what sectoral laws cannot — apply rules tailored to the specific risks and challenges posed by AI.\nIt rightly classifies financial service use cases like credit scoring and life insurance pricing as “high-risk”, triggering requirements for risk management, transparency, human oversight and data governance.\nBut even here, critical gaps remain.\nBank account access, home and motor insurance, and retail investment advice fall outside the high-risk list, despite their role in everyday life. As AI adoption accelerates across the financial sector, more consumers will be exposed to opaque systems that make consequential decisions without explanation or recourse.\nAnd in its current form, the AI Act leaves this reality unaddressed.\nThe risks of AI are not speculative. It’s not a question of whether AI causes harm, it already does.\nThe real question is whether the promise of 'competitiveness' will serve as justification for an incomplete rulebook, or whether the EU will designate financial services uses as high-risk under the AI Act and plug the gaps.\nConsumers are already falling through.\nThis year, we turn 25 and are looking for 2,500 new supporting members to take their stake in EU democracy. A functioning EU relies on a well-informed public – you.\nPeter Norwood is senior research and advocacy officer at Finance Watch, where he leads work on retail finance, consumer protection and financial inclusion.
