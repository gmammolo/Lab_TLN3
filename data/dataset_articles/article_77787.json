  "text": "Featured\nAugust 21, 2025 by\nBlessing Olaifa, Abuja\n13million social media accounts shut down\n- Offensive content triggers action\nLeading global platforms Google, Microsoft and TikTok have shut down and deactivated more than 13 million social media accounts.\nAlso taken down were 58.9 million contents considered as obscene.\nThe National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) said the measures were in line with Nigeria’s Code of Practice for online platforms. The Code highlighted efforts by social media platforms to mitigate online harm.\nIn a statement yesterday by its Corporate Communications/ Media Relations Director, Hajiya Hadiza Umar, the NITDA said 13,597,057 accounts have been shut down for posting offensive contents and violating the code of practice guiding social media usage.\nThe statement was jointly issued by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the NITDA and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC).\nThe accounts, the statement noted, were said to have breached the rules guiding platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter).\nHajiya Umar said the government’s actions were contained in the 2024 Code of Practice Compliance Report submitted by promoters of interactive computer service platforms such as Google, Microsoft and Tik Tok.\nCommending Google, Microsoft and TikTok for their continued compliance with the Code of Practice for Interactive Computer Service Platforms/Internet Intermediaries, Umar noted that there were 754, 629 “registered complaint.”\nShe said that 420,439 contents were removed but re-uploaded following appeals by users.\nThe statement reads: “The compliance reports provide valuable insights into the platforms’ efforts to address user safety concerns in line with the Code of Practice and the platforms’ community guidelines.\n“The submission of these reports marks a significant step towards fostering a safer and responsible digital environment for Nigerian users.\n“It also demonstrates the platforms’ commitment to ensuring a secure and trustworthy online environment for all.”\nRead Also: ‘Nigerian visa applicants to show five years social media activity’\n“This achievement reflects the provisions of the Code of Practice, which mandates that large service platforms are registered in Nigeria and comply with relevant laws including the fulfillment of their tax obligation, while reinforcing the commitment to online safety for Nigerians.\n“While NITDA acknowledges these commendable efforts, we emphasize that building a safer digital space requires sustained collaboration and engagement among all stakeholders.\n“We remain committed to working with industry players, civil society, and regulatory partners to further strengthen user safety measures, enhance digital literacy, and promote trust and transparency in Nigeria’s digital ecosystem.”",
