  "text": "Mobile Recharge: Jio has discontinued its cheapest plan, due to which customers will now have to pay more for data. Airtel has also reduced the data limit of its plan. After this, Vodafone Idea (Vi) can also do the same soon.\nMobile Recharge: After the closure of Jio’s entry level prepaid plan, now people have to pay more money for data and calling. For your information, let us tell you that Reliance Jio has discontinued its cheapest Rs 249 plan. In this plan, users used to get 1 GB data every day. Following the path of Jio, Airtel has also reduced the data limit of one of its plans. The next eye is on Vodafone Idea (Vi). It is believed that Vi can also do this soon, because it has happened many times before that after the move of other companies, other companies have done this. Media reports say that this will increase the earnings of telecom companies. Let us know whether Vi customers will also have to pay more money.\nShock before tariff hike\nTelecom companies have found a new way to charge more money from customers without increasing the tariff. The tariff is expected to increase next year, but even before that people are having to pay more money for data. Jio has discontinued the Rs 249 plan and started a plan with 1.5 GB data. Its price is Rs 299.\nVi is still giving 1GB daily data\nVi is still giving its users a plan of Rs 299, in which 1 GB data is available every day. After the move of Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, now Vodafone Idea (Vi) can also do the same soon. Due to this, customers will have to pay more money to use data. Experts say that this will increase the earnings of telecom companies. Companies are forcing people to pay more money without increasing the tariff. According to the report of ET Telecom, JM Financial Company has said that like Bharti Airtel and Jio, Vi can also discontinue its 1 GB data plan. This will benefit the companies more. It has been told in its report that Vi will also follow Jio and discontinue its 1GB daily data plan.\nCompanies’ earnings will increase\nIf the report is to be believed, 20-25% of Jio customers use 1GB data plans. Due to this, the company’s ARPU can increase by 11-13 per month. Similarly, about 18-20% of Airtel customers use plans with 1GB daily data. About 20-25% of Vi customers use plans with 1GB data. If VI also discontinues this plan, its ARPU may increase by Rs 13-14 per month.",
