  "text": "PS5 Price Hike Announced in US: Full Console Price List and Why Sony Raised Costs\nPS5 price hike announced in US amid tariffs and inflation. Here’s the updated PlayStation 5 console price list.\nPlayStation 5 Costs More From August 21 in US: Tariffs, Inflation Drive Price Increase\nWashington, D.C.: Sony has announced a price hike for the PlayStation 5 in the US, effective August 21, marking the console’s first major price adjustment since launch. The change will affect all PS5 models, though accessory prices remain unchanged.\n“Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment. As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the US starting on August 21,” said Isabelle Tomatis, Vice President of Global Marketing at Sony Interactive Entertainment.\nNew PlayStation 5 Retail Prices → Effective August 21\n♦ PlayStation 5 Standard Edition → ★ $549.99\n♦ PlayStation 5 Digital Edition → ★ $499.99\n♦ PlayStation 5 Pro → ★ $749.99\nWhy the Price Hike? → Inflation, Tariffs, and Supply Chain Pressure\nThe adjustment comes amid:\n♦ Global inflationary pressures\n♦ Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on imports from major tech manufacturing hubs like China and Japan\n♦ Rising production and material costs, alongside supply chain disruptions\nSony had previously increased PS5 prices in the UK, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand in April, signaling that similar adjustments in the US were likely. By May, Sony hinted it was evaluating further hikes to offset tariff costs.\nIndustry-Wide Impact → Xbox and Nintendo Follow Suit\n♦ Microsoft raised Xbox hardware and accessory prices earlier this year, with the Xbox Series X Digital Edition now at $549.99.\n♦ Nintendo has increased Switch accessory prices and, earlier this month, raised the cost of the original Switch console ahead of its Switch 2 launch, also citing tariff impacts.\nWith holiday season shopping approaching, gamers are voicing frustration on social media, calling the move another blow to their wallets.",
