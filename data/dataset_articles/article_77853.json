  "text": "Greentech company Saltx Technology reported a substantial increase in revenue but a decline in profit for the second quarter.\nRevenue rose to SEK 21.2 million (4.6).\nOperating profit amounted to -SEK 1.8 million (4.8). Net profit after tax was -SEK 0.9 million (4.6). Earnings per share came in at -SEK 0.01 (0.03).\nCash flow from operating activities totaled SEK 9.7 million (-20).\n\"We are on the threshold of something big. In just one year, we have moved from successful tests to taking our place in the industrial reality. Our three application areas – lime, cement, and DAC – are all embarking on a journey where the technology will be further developed and adapted, plans will be deepened, and the pace will increase in close collaboration with our partners,\" said CEO Lina Jorheden in the report.\nShe continues:\n\"Several of these partnerships are still new, and the work we are doing together is crucial for laying the foundation for a long-term and scalable rollout. In parallel, we are continuing our intensive efforts to design and optimize our revenue model, based on income streams from license fees, hardware, and consulting fees. Once we have the answers we need and the structure is in place, we will be able to present a more detailed roadmap going forward,\" she added.\nSaltx Technology, SEK million Q2-2025 Q2-2024 Change Net Revenue 21.2 4.6 360.9% Operating Profit -1.8 4.8 Operating Margin 104.3% Net Profit -0.9 4.6 Earnings per share, SEK -0.01 0.03 Cash flow from operating activities 9.7 -20\n© Finwire - 2025",
