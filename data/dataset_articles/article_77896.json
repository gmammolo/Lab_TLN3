  "text": "Tariffs strike again?\nSony has today announced that it will raise the price of the PS5 in the USA because of “a challenging economic environment”.\nThe following prices will be applicable in the USA from 21 August, or tomorrow across the pond.\n- PlayStation 5 – $549.99\n- PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – $499.99\n- PlayStation 5 Pro – $749.99\n“Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment,” Sony said of its latest price hike. “As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21.\n“The recommended retail prices for PlayStation 5 accessories remain unchanged, and we have no other price changes to announce for additional markets.”\nAustralia will not see a PS5 price increase… though we’ve suffered through a couple increases to date.\nThis article may contain affiliate links, meaning we could earn a small commission if you click-through and make a purchase.
