  "text": "All those who were planning to buy the PlayStation 5 in the US will now have to pay more, as Sony has officially announced a new price hike. And yes, it is linked to the Trump tariffs, which have now increased to 25% for electronic goods imported from Japan.\nThe price of each PS5 model has gone up by $50. The standard PS5 is now priced at $550, the PS5 Digital Edition at $500, and the PS5 Pro at $750.\nIn the official press release, Sony’s VP of Global Marketing, Isabelle Tomatis shared the reason behind the price rise\nSimilar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment. As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21.\nThe revised pricing will take effect from August 21,2025 in the US. Sony has confirmed that there are no changes to pricing in other markets at the moment. The hike currently applies only to the consoles, while accessories remain unchanged—for now. However, it is uncertain how long this will last.",
