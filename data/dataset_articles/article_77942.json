  "text": "byPakLai Ng\nBreak of the 94.90 support see prices extending losses from the 97.40 July high to reach 94.40 low\nAsterisk denotes strength of level\n06:50 GMT - Break of the 94.90 support see prices extending losses from the 97.40 July high to reach 94.40 low. Consolidation here see prices unwinding the oversold intraday studies but this is expected to give way to renewed selling pressure later. Lower will see room to further retrace the April/July rally to the 94.00 level. Lower still, will see room to 93.25/93.05 support and 38.2% Fibonacci level. Meanwhile, resistance is lowered to the 4 August low at 94.90 which is expected to cap and sustain losses from the 97.40, July high.\nor",
