  "text": "from Revolver News :\nChemo is supposed to kill cancer. That’s the whole point, right? But a jaw-dropping new study says it might be doing the exact opposite—waking up “sleeping” cancer cells and jumpstarting deadly relapses, especially in the lungs.\nWe’ve all been told for decades that chemo is the best, most aggressive way to treat cancer. But what if the same treatment that shrinks tumors also reactivates hidden cancer cells… the ones that were lying dormant, waiting? And worse, what if Big Pharma has known this for years and done absolutely nothing?\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\nAccording to a new write-up by Nicholas Hulscher over on Dr. Peter McCullough’s Substack , chemo might be doing more harm than we thought. A shocking new study published in Cancer Cell found that common cancer drugs like doxorubicin and cisplatin aren’t just shrinking tumors; they’re waking up “dormant” cancer cells that were hiding out in the body, setting the stage for aggressive, often deadly relapses later on, as we said earlier, especially in the lungs. These sleeping cells are called DTCs and can lie low for years. And for the first time ever, researchers say they’ve proven that chemo itself can flip the switch and bring them back to life.\nHere are the five key takeaways from the study:\n1. Chemotherapy Reactivates Dormant Cancer Cells\nUsing a tool called DormTracer, researchers found that chemo-treated mice had a spike in dormant cancer cells suddenly reactivating and re-entering the cell cycle.\nThese reawakened cells went on to form aggressive lung metastases just weeks after treatment—even when the primary tumor was completely gone.\nThe kicker? Chemo still worked against active tumors, but it unintentionally woke up the sleeping ones.\n2. Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) Are the Trigger\nChemo didn’t just target cancer—it also caused fibroblasts in the lungs to enter a state of senescence (basically, biological aging).\nThese senescent cells sent out inflammatory signals that activated neutrophils (a type of white blood cell).\nThe neutrophils responded by forming NETs, sticky DNA-and-enzyme webs, that reshaped the lung environment and directly triggered dormant cancer cells to switch back on.\nRead More @ Revolver.news",
