  "text": "Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce has delivered a stark warning to Australians, cautioning that artificial intelligence (AI) could soon displace large sections of the workforce. Speaking on national television, the former Deputy Prime Minister stressed that while many workers are fighting for flexibility through remote work, they may be inadvertently making it easier for employers to replace them with machines. His remarks come as AI adoption accelerates across industries and unions push for stronger workplace rights in a changing environment. Joyce emphasized that clerical and administrative roles are likely to be the first wiped out, followed by a broader wave of job losses across multiple sectors. He argued that without urgent policy responses and education reforms, Australia risks creating a generation left behind by rapid technological change.Barnaby Joyce says clerical jobs are most at risk from AIIn his interview, Joyce doubled down on the threat posed by artificial intelligence to so-called “keyboard jobs.” He painted a grim picture in which data entry clerks, administrative assistants, and bookkeepers could see their livelihoods vanish almost overnight. “AI is not a myth. It is already here,” he said, stressing that automation could eliminate thousands of back-office roles with ruthless efficiency.Joyce noted that while white-collar workers are often seen as more secure, AI flips that assumption on its head. Unlike trades that require physical presence and hands-on skills, office tasks are highly replicable in digital form. He said Australians must be proactive in safeguarding their future: “Don’t assume your job is safe just because you’re educated. AI is clever enough to rewrite reports, organise spreadsheets, and even draft legal documents. If employers realise you can do all this from your living room, they’ll just ask, why not let the algorithm handle it?”Barnaby Joyce criticises work-from-home demandsThe Australian Services Union recently announced plans to petition the Fair Work Commission to strengthen the rights of employees who prefer to work from home. Their submission argues that remote work is now a “permanent feature” of modern employment and should not diminish the value of an employee’s contributions. The union has gone as far as calling for a mandatory six-month notice period before any employer can force staff back into the office.Joyce, however, dismissed this demand as unrealistic and dangerous. He argued that while work-from-home arrangements might feel convenient, they open the door for companies to realise that clerical roles can be easily digitised or outsourced. “If your job is essentially you, a keyboard, and a computer, then you’re on thin ice,” he warned. “Employers will quickly learn that AI can do the same work without sick leave, without holidays, and without the risk of industrial disputes.”Trades and hands-on work remain secureDespite his dire predictions for clerical staff, Joyce offered a glimmer of reassurance for workers in manual trades. He emphasised that electricians, plumbers, carpenters, and mechanics remain largely shielded from the coming wave of AI disruption. “Robots can crunch numbers, but they cannot crawl under your sink or rewire a fuse box,” he remarked. “AI does not have hands or feet. Trades will remain the backbone of stable employment in this country.”By contrasting desk jobs with skilled manual labour, Joyce suggested that young Australians should seriously consider vocational training. He argued that as society becomes more reliant on technology, those who can physically build, repair, and install infrastructure will only become more valuable.Experts echo and challenge Joyce’s warningJoyce is not alone in raising concerns. Social Services Minister Tanya Plibersek has also acknowledged the threat AI poses to repetitive jobs, although she urged Australians not to lose sight of the opportunities in emerging industries. She argued that the key lies in steering innovation to create jobs rather than destroy them, pointing to the potential for Australia to become a developer of AI technologies rather than just a consumer.Meanwhile, research backs up Joyce’s fears to an extent. Studies by Roy Morgan show that more than 6.7 million Australians, or around 46 percent of the workforce, now work from home at least some of the time. A separate analysis by Victoria University and the International Labour Organization suggests that nearly one-third of Australian jobs could theoretically be automated by AI. Clerical roles top the list of vulnerable occupations, while cleaning, hospitality, and the trades appear more resistant.AI’s impact on all industriesJobs and Skills Australia commissioner Barney Glover has tried to balance the debate, noting that while sweeping job losses are not inevitable, no sector will escape unscathed. “The overarching message is that almost all occupations will be augmented by AI,” he said. “From law firms to retail, from health care to logistics, AI will change the way every professional works. It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of how fast.”This evolving reality will be a central theme at the federal government’s productivity roundtable in Canberra this week. Policymakers, union leaders, and industry representatives are expected to debate how best to adapt to AI’s rise while protecting Australian workers. For now, Joyce’s blunt message cuts through the noise: jobs tied to keyboards and screens are in the crosshairs, and only those prepared to adapt will thrive.",
