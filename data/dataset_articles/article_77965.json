  "text": "What to know\n- Focus Friend uses a gamified timer to encourage focus, featuring a cute bean character that knits while you work.\n- Set timers to block distracting apps, earning \"socks\" to decorate your bean’s room if you stay focused.\n- Deep Focus Mode integrates with screen time settings to lock apps, with customizable options in the Pro version.\n- Designed for ADHD users, it’s ad-free, privacy-focused, and available on iOS and Android.\nMeet your new Productivity pal\nEver find yourself doomscrolling when you should be working? Focus Friend, created by Hank Green and Honey B Games, is here to help you stay on task with a delightful twist.\nImagine a tiny, adorable bean knitting away on your phone screen. Your job? Keep that bean happy by resisting the urge to check TikTok or play mobile games.\nIt’s a productivity app that’s as cute as it is effective, especially for those with ADHD or anyone struggling to focus.\nHow Focus Friend works: The basics\nFocus Friend is built around the Pomodoro method, a time-management technique where you work in focused bursts (typically 25 minutes) followed by short breaks. Here’s the rundown:\n- Set a Timer: Choose a focus session length, from a quick 15 minutes to a marathon 120 minutes. Your bean gets to work knitting socks while you focus on your task—be it studying, chores, or work.\n- Avoid Distractions: If you interrupt the timer by using your phone, your bean gets sad, and its knitting unravels. This emotional nudge makes you think twice about opening distracting apps.\n- Earn Rewards: Complete a session without interruptions, and your bean rewards you with “socks,” an in-game currency. Use these to buy decorations like posters or plants for your bean’s cozy digital room.\n- Deep Focus Mode: For extra discipline, enable Deep Focus Mode. This integrates with your phone’s screen time settings to block apps like Instagram or games during your session. You can customize which apps to block, leaving essentials like music or calendars accessible.\nWhy it’s so charming and deeply satisfying\nWhat sets Focus Friend apart is its gamified, guilt-inducing charm. Your bean—customizable with names like Garbanzo or Susan Bean Anthony—knits socks or scarves (with the Pro version) while you work.\nIf you pick up your phone, the bean’s disappointed face is enough to make you put it back down.\nIt’s like a Tamagotchi in reverse: instead of nurturing a digital pet, you’re nurturing your own focus. The app’s funky background music and cute animations add to the dopamine hit, making productivity feel rewarding.\nFree vs. Pro: What you get\nFocus Friend is free to use, with no account required and a strong emphasis on privacy—no data collection or ads. You can enjoy the core features, like setting timers and earning socks, without spending a dime.\nHowever, the Pro version ($1.99/month, $14.99/year, or $29.99 lifetime) unlocks extras:\n- More Rewards: Your bean can knit scarves for premium decorations.\n- Custom Beans: Unlock skins like Kitty Bean, Coffee Bean, or even Hank and John Green-inspired beans.\n- Allowlisted Apps: Choose specific apps to remain accessible during Deep Focus Mode.\nThe free version is robust, but the Pro upgrade adds flair for those who love customizing their bean’s world.\nPerfect for ADHD and beyond\nFocus Friend is marketed as “ADHD-friendly,” and users love its effectiveness for staying present. The app’s simplicity—no complex dashboards or stat tracking—makes it accessible for anyone, from students to professionals.\nWhether you’re folding laundry or tackling a work project, the bean’s knitting keeps you motivated. Users report cutting screen time in half and feeling more engaged in tasks, thanks to the app’s gentle nudge to stay off their phones.\nTips to get the most out of focus friend\nWant to make Focus Friend your ultimate focus buddy? Try these:\n- Start small: Set short timers (15–25 minutes) to build your focus muscle without feeling overwhelmed.\n- Enable Deep Focus mode: Block your biggest time-wasters (looking at you, social media) to create a distraction-free zone.\n- Enjoy the breaks: Use the Pomodoro break timers to decorate your bean’s room—it’s a fun reward that keeps you engaged.\n- Experiment with music: The app’s funky tunes can help you stay in the zone. Enable the “Play Music When App is Closed” setting to keep the vibes going even when your screen is off.\nA few things to keep in mind\nWhile Focus Friend is a hit, it’s not perfect. Some users wish for more room decorations or additional rooms to keep the game fresh after decorating the initial space.\nOthers note that Deep Focus Mode can be too restrictive in the free version, locking out nearly all apps unless you upgrade to Pro.\nIf you use other focus apps like Opal or Forest, you may need to disable them to avoid conflicts with Apple’s screen time settings.\nWhy you’ll love it\nFocus Friend isn’t just another productivity app—it’s a delightful companion that makes focusing fun. By tying your productivity to a cute bean’s knitting dreams, it taps into your empathy and rewards you with a sense of accomplishment.\nWhether you’re battling procrastination or just want to spend less time scrolling, this app’s simple, ad-free design and charming premise make it worth a try. Download it on iOS or Android, name your bean, and start knitting your way to better focus today!\nHave you tried Focus Friend yet? Let me know how your bean is helping you stay on track!",
