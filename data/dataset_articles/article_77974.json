Concerns also span political misuse, military applications, social impacts, and energy consumption. The findings highlight growing workforce and societal unease as AI adoption accelerates.\nA new\nBeyond employment, Americans are uneasy about AI’s societal and ethical implications. Some 77% fear AI could be misused to create political chaos, reflecting concerns over deepfake videos and misinformation. Military applications also raise alarm, with 48% opposing government use of AI to target military strikes, and 28% uncertain.\nEnvironmental impact is another workforce-relevant concern.

It underscores that while AI adoption accelerates across tech giants like Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft, Americans remain cautious about its broader implications for employment, society, and the environment.\nReuters/Ipsos pollreveals widespread anxiety among Americans about artificial intelligence, particularly its potential effect on employment.
