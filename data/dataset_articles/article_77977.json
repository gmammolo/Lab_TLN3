  "text": "One of North America’s most iconic esports organizations, Complexity Gaming , just announced it is stepping away from Counter-Strike after more than two decades in the scene. This is a seismic shift for fans, players, and the industry. Here’s what’s happened and what it means.\nAn update from @JasonBWLake pic.twitter.com/C6MQxk44Zr\n— Complexity (@Complexity) August 19, 2025 The End of an Era In a personal video statement, CEO and founder Jason Lake broke the news, calling it a “tough day.” He confirmed Complexity is officially withdrawing from all Counter-Strike 2 operations and dropping its roster, ending its 22-year involvement in the franchise. This isn’t just any exit Complexity was one of North America’s last major orgs in the game, and its departure is widely seen as a bellwether for the health (or lack thereof) of North American CS as a whole.\nLake was blunt: “After a real strong 2023 and 2024, 2025 in the esports economy has been really challenging for us. Quite simply, we have not been able to drive enough revenue to afford to properly support a Tier 1 team.” The roster, which hovered around the #20 spot globally, is reportedly moving to Ukrainian organization Passion UA.\nWhy Now? For Lake and Complexity, this was a practical business call, not a knee-jerk reaction. The organization reportedly explored every angle to secure investment and sponsorships but found nothing was sustainable in 2025’s climate. “We could have dragged things out, but we wanted to do right by our players,” Lake said. For months, fans and analysts have noted the team’s dwindling results, lack of tournament wins, and inability to attract the kind of sponsorship deals that fuel top teams in Europe and Asia.\nThe Story Behind the Scene This isn’t just about one team. The esports landscape in 2025 is brutally difficult for nearly everyone outside the top few global franchises. Organizations struggle to make money unless they consistently win – or partner with betting companies, which Complexity notably avoided for integrity reasons, a decision that may have cost them financially. As Lake put it, “We’ve tried everything. This was not the outcome any of us wanted, but it’s the only responsible one.”\nThe move leaves North America without a prominent org to carry its flag in Counter-Strike’s main league—a status only heightened by Complexity’s storied history, global fanbase, and connections to big-name partners like the Dallas Cowboys.\nWhat Happens Now? There are no immediate plans for Complexity to return to Counter-Strike until the economic picture improves. Lake thanked the players, staff, and fans for their support, and promised to fulfill all community tournament obligations, including the NA Revival Series.\nFor North American Counter-Strike, this is a symbolic blow—yet another sign that even the most passionate and resilient organizations are finding it impossible to sustain top-tier teams amid shrinking revenues, tough competition, and a shifting sponsorship landscape. One thing’s for sure: anyone who still thinks esports is an easy business hasn’t been paying attention.",
