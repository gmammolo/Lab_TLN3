  "text": "Apple’s highly anticipated MacBook Pro models refresh with M5 chips may not arrive as soon as expected. According to a new research note by respected supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the next generation of Apple’s professional laptops could be pushed back until 2026. This comes just weeks after Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman suggested Apple was “considering” delaying the release of M5-powered MacBook Pros.\nIf accurate, this would mean Apple’s MacBook Pro lineup will go without a major silicon upgrade in 2025, a departure from the company’s usual cadence of updating its custom chips every 12 to 18 months.\nKuo’s note provides technical details that shed light on Apple’s production challenges. He explained that the A20 chips for the upcoming iPhone 18 series will be produced using WMCM (Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module) technology. This process integrates both underfill and molding processes, improving efficiency and increasing manufacturing yield rates essentially, boosting the number of usable chips from each silicon wafer.\nHowever, when it comes to the high-end M5 chips such as the M5 Pro and M5 Max variants expected for MacBook Pros Apple will reportedly not use WMCM. Instead, these chips will continue to rely on separate underfill and molding processes. This difference in manufacturing approach likely contributes to supply chain complexities and could be a factor in the delayed rollout.\nFrom 2025 to 2026: The Delay Becomes Clear Rumors had previously suggested that Apple would debut M5 MacBook Pro models in late 2025. Kuo’s note, however, specifically mentions “2026 MacBooks” when referring to M5-equipped laptops, making it the strongest indication yet that the refresh won’t come until the following year.\nBloomberg’s Gurman echoed a similar timeline in July, noting that Apple was internally debating whether to shift the launch of its M5 MacBook Pro models. The new reports strongly suggest that the delay is now almost certain.\nFor users, this means that Apple’s M4 MacBook Pros, which launched earlier in 2024, will remain the company’s most powerful laptops for a longer-than-usual cycle.\nThe delay of the M5 MacBook Pro could have significant implications:\nSlower Upgrade Cycle for Professionals\nMany creative professionals, developers, and scientists rely on the MacBook Pro’s cutting-edge chips for demanding workloads. A delay in upgrades could mean some users postpone purchases or even explore alternatives.\nM4 Macs Will Need to Hold Stronger\nWith M5 MacBook Pros pushed to 2026, Apple will likely focus on optimizing the M4 lineup, ensuring that the M4 Pro and M4 Max continue to meet performance demands for at least two more years.\nSupply Chain Challenges\nThe use of different manufacturing methods for A-series and M-series chips hints at Apple’s ongoing balancing act between cutting-edge innovation and production scalability.\nThe Bigger Picture: M6 Macs on the Horizon Interestingly, Kuo’s note also provides a long-term perspective. He recommends that consumers who can wait might want to skip the M5 generation entirely. That’s because the M6 series, expected around early 2027, could bring major design changes.\nAccording to early reports, the M6 MacBook Pro models might feature:\nOLED displays for superior color and efficiency.\nThinner chassis designs, further pushing Apple’s obsession with portability.\nReduced notch size or potentially even a move toward under-display camera technology.\nIf true, these upgrades would represent one of the most significant leaps in MacBook Pro design since Apple’s transition to Apple Silicon in 2020.\nApple’s Chip Development Timeline To put this into context, Apple has been on an aggressive schedule since debuting its in-house silicon:\nM1 (2020): The groundbreaking transition from Intel.\nM2 (2022): Incremental upgrades with improved efficiency.\nM3 (2023): First Mac chip built on a 3nm process.\nM4 (2024): AI-focused chip with performance-per-watt improvements.\nM5 (2026?): Now likely delayed by a full year.\nM6 (2027): Expected to mark a major leap with OLED and design overhauls.\nThe gap between M4 and M5 nearly two years mould be the longest in Apple Silicon history.\nWhat Users Should Do Now\nFor professionals and enthusiasts eyeing their next MacBook Pro upgrade, the decision comes down to timing and needs:\nIf your current system is showing its age, the M4 MacBook Pro remains one of the most powerful and efficient laptops on the market. With no M5 models expected until 2026, buying now ensures you won’t be stuck waiting years for a refresh.\nIf you can wait and want meaningful design changes, holding out for the M6 generation in 2027 could be worthwhile, especially if Apple delivers OLED displays and a slimmer form factor.\nThe delay of the M5 MacBook Pro to 2026 reflects the complexities of Apple’s supply chain and the challenges of scaling advanced chip production. While disappointing for those hoping for a 2025 refresh, the extended timeline may allow Apple to refine its silicon strategy and prepare for the bigger leap with the M6 generation.\nIn the meantime, the M4 MacBook Pro models are set to hold the line, offering impressive performance and efficiency gains that should satisfy most users until Apple’s next big move.",
