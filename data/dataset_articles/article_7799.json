  "text": "Teen stabbed to death in Jamalpur\nA teenage boy was stabbed to death following an altercation at a party in Jamalpur's Sadar upazila last night.\nThe victim was identified as Jihad, 16, son of Firuz Ahmed of Gaherpara village.\nConfirming the murder, Officer-in-Charge of Jamalpur Sadar Police Station, Mizanur Rahman, told The Daily Star that the incident occurred after Maghrib prayers near Jihad's relative's house, where a \"muri party\" was arranged.\nAn argument between two youths, Munna and Sayeed, over a trivial matter escalated into a scuffle. When Jihad got involved in the scuffle, Munna allegedly stabbed Jihad from behind with a sharp weapon, the OC said.\nJihad's cousin, Sakib, said he was rushed to the hospital in critical condition but could not be saved. He demanded the immediate arrest of those involved.\nHe was critically injured and later died at Jamalpur General Hospital, according to on-duty doctors.\nPolice responded to the scene and the hospital after receiving information, OC Mizanur Rahman.\n\"The incident is being investigated, and legal action will be taken accordingly,\" he said, adding that no case had been filed as of last night.",
