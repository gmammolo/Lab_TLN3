  "text": "Google says its new Pixel 10 series phones will not remain dust and water-resistant forever, here is why\nAlong with all the headline features of the Pixel 10 series, there's also a less flashy but very important piece of information hidden in Google's fine print — the phones won't remain IP68 dust and water-resistant forever.\nGoogle’s new Pixel 10 series has officially arrived in India with a starting price of Rs 79,999. The phone features a familiar design, along with meaningful upgrades, including the new Tensor G5 chip, improved cameras, enhanced AI features, and a stronger battery promise. On paper, it looks like a solid upgrade for Pixel fans. But along with all the headline features, there’s also a less flashy but very important piece of information hidden in Google’s fine print — the Pixel 10s IP68 dust and water resistance is not permanent. In other words, while the phone is certified for protection against dust and splashes when it leaves the factory, it won’t stay that way forever.\nThe reason for this comes down to how phones are built. Google explains that the seals, gaskets and adhesives used to keep dust and water out will naturally wear down over time. Everyday use, temperature changes, and simple ageing of materials cause these protective layers to weaken. A small drop or bump may not shatter your screen, but it can still cause tiny cracks or gaps that reduce water resistance. And if your phone is ever opened up for a repair, like replacing a battery or a display, there’s a good chance the protective seals will never be as strong as before.\nAnother important point is that the IP68 rating itself has limits. The Pixel 10 can handle submersion in water at a specific depth and for a set duration under controlled lab conditions. But that doesn’t mean it will survive every real-world scenario. Saltwater at the beach, chlorinated pool water, or even your favourite soft drink spilling onto the device can all damage it in ways the IP rating doesn’t cover. Google also makes it very clear: liquid damage voids the warranty. So while the Pixel 10 may survive an accidental splash, it’s not designed to be your underwater camera or survive repeated dunks.\nThat being said, the Pixel 10 series still brings plenty to be excited about. Just looking at the standard Pixel 10 itself, it features the latest Tensor G5 chip, built on a more efficient 3nm process, which promises smoother performance and better battery life. Google has added a vapour cooling system to keep heating under control, and the 4,970mAh battery is claimed to last over 30 hours on a single charge, with support for 30W wired charging and 15W Qi2 wireless charging. AI is also front and centre, with features like Magic Cue for smart suggestions, expanded Live Translate, and a personalised Daily Hub for at-a-glance information.\nOn the camera side, Google is sticking with its strength in computational photography but also giving users a capable hardware trio — a 48-megapixel primary sensor, a 13-megapixel ultra-wide, and, for the first time on a non-Pro Pixel model, a 10.8-megapixel telephoto with 5x zoom. For selfies and video calls, there’s a 10.5-megapixel camera at the front. The display, a 6.3-inch OLED panel, comes with up to 3,000 nits of brightness, and there’s Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on both the front and back for protection against bumps and scratches.\nApart from this, the lineup also includes the Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. All devices come with a range of features and upgrades, including the IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, all while keeping the same starting prices as last year’s models. The company has launched its latest Pixel Watch 4 and the long-awaited upgrade to its budget TWS earbuds, the Pixel Buds 2a.",
