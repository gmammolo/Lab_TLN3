  "text": "Credit: Rita El Khoury / Android Authority The first pictures taken with the Pixel 10 Pro’s Pro Res Zoom feature have surfaced online. Pro Res Zoom uses generative AI to capture better long-range zoom shots, at up to 100x. These early samples show some glaring limitations with the technology. The newly launched Google Pixel 10 Pro phones offer a 100x Pro Res Zoom feature. This uses generative AI to improve image quality, but is this just heavy-handed AI or something genuinely useful? Well, the first samples have surfaced online.\nRedditor Dry_Astronomer3210 tried out the Pixel 10 Pro XL’s Pro Res Zoom feature at a Best Buy store, posting samples in the process. Check out the 30x and 100x comparisons below.",
