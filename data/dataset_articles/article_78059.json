  "text": "Much against the arguments advanced by gaming companies opposing the ban on real-money gaming, the government estimates that nearly 45 crore people lose close to Rs 20,000 crore annually in online real-money gaming, according to data cited by an official source on Wednesday, as reported by TOI.The source said the government considers online money gaming to be a “major problem for society” and has therefore decided to prioritise people’s welfare over the revenue loss the exchequer will face as a result of the ban. “There is a rough estimate that 45 crore people lose money every year. The total impact of the loss is estimated to be around Rs 20,000 crore,” the source was quoted as saying, on the day the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025 was tabled and passed in the Lok Sabha.“Every parliamentarian has raised concerns about the ill effects of online gaming involving money. Between revenue from one-third of the industry segment and social welfare, the government has chosen the welfare of society,” the source told TOI.The bill seeks to ban all forms of real-money gaming while promoting e-sports and online social gaming. According to the government, these segments account for nearly two-thirds of the industry and will now be supported through budgetary allocation, new schemes and the creation of a dedicated authority. The move, officials believe, will also generate new employment opportunities in the online gaming sector.Under the new legislation, state governments will be the primary enforcers of action against entities involved in money gaming. Any individual or company offering online money gaming services in violation of the rules could face imprisonment of up to three years, a fine of up to Rs 1 crore, or both. Furthermore, those publishing advertisements in contravention of the law may be penalised with imprisonment of up to two years and/or a fine of up to Rs 50 lakh.A senior source told TOI that several real-money gaming platforms had been “masquerading as games of skill” in order to distinguish themselves from gambling or betting. Importantly, the bill clarifies that players themselves will not be punished; instead, legal action will be directed at providers of money gaming platforms, payment facilitators and other enablers.The government, according to TOI, has been attempting to regulate online money gaming for over three-and-a-half years. Previous efforts through the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime proved ineffective, as operators found ways to bypass regulations. A proposal for an independent regulatory body was also considered but reportedly failed due to conflicts of interest.The provisions in the new bill, officials emphasised, have been carefully drafted after years of deliberation and numerous complaints from both the public and elected representatives.Inputs from TOI",
