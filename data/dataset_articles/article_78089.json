  "text": "Produced by: Mohsin Shaikh\nAt a 2025 tech conference in Beijing, a humanoid robot stood on stage—pregnant. China’s Kaiwa Technology claims it will deliver the world’s first robotic birth by 2026. The future? It just kicked.\nInside the robot's belly: synthetic amniotic fluid, nutrient tubes, and a machine-grown placenta. It’s not science fiction—it’s a nine-month simulation of human gestation in steel and silicone.\nNo uterus, no surrogates, no human touch. The artificial womb aims to grow a baby from embryo to birth without ever entering a body. And it's priced cheaper than IVF.\nFor $14,000, you could grow a baby inside a humanoid robot. That’s the promise. But in a country where surrogacy is banned, this metal midwife is raising legal and moral alarms.\nThere’s a catch—Chinese law forbids embryos from developing past 14 days outside the body. To go full term, this tech will need a legal reboot. Until then, it’s frozen at the start line.\nCan a baby bond with a robot? Ethicists warn of psychological risks, identity confusion, and developmental unknowns. Kaiwa’s answer? They're still “studying the data.”\nFrom premature lambs in U.S. “biobags” to humanoid gestation chambers in Guangzhou, artificial womb tech is racing ahead. But are we ready for babies born in labs?\nIf successful, this robot could redefine motherhood, childbirth, and human reproduction. Feminist scholars call it both liberating and deeply disturbing. The debate is only beginning.\nNo babies yet—but the prototype was unveiled in full humanoid form at the 2025 World Robot Conference. By next year, it may be showing contractions.",
