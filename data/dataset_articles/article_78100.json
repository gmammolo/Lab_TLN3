The disruption in services is one of the worst in recent years, said Industry officials.\nAs per estimates, about two-thirds of users have been impacted by the internet outage, said the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (WISPAP), in a statement.\nInternet access in the country dropped to just 20% of normal levels, according to NetBlocks, a global internet observatory.\n\"Metrics show a major disruption to internet connectivity across Pakistan with high impact to backbone operator PTCL; overall national connectivity is down to 20% of ordinary levels,\" NetBlocks wrote in a post on X.\nA similar internet disruption had hit the country three years back in in 2022, when fibre routes were damaged by floods, according to The News International, a local media organisation.\nReacting on the disruption, the chairman of Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan raised concerns said, \"Internet outages are no longer rare accidents in Pakistan; they have become a recurring reality. For two-thirds of the country to go dark in 2025, on the very date we saw the same collapse in 2022, should ring alarm bells at every level of government.\"",
