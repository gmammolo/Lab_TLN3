  "text": "MOSCOW :A Russian state-backed messenger application cast as a rival to WhatsApp which critics have said could be used for surveillance purposes must be pre-installed on all mobile phones and tablets from next month, the Russian government said on Thursday.\nThe decision to promote the popularity of MAX, the new state-controlled messaging app, comes after Russia restricted some calls on WhatsApp, owned by Meta Platforms META.O, and on Telegram, accusing the foreign-owned platforms of failing to share information with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases.\nThe government, which is seeking greater control over the internet space, said in a statement on Thursday that MAX, which will be integrated with government services, would be on the list of mandatory pre-installed apps on all \"gadgets\", including mobile phones and tablets, sold in Russia from September 1.\nIt will also be mandatory from the same date for Russia's domestic app store, RuStore, currently pre-installed on all Android devices, to be pre-installed on all Apple devices, the government said.\nAn online Russian-language TV app called LIME HD TV, which allows people to watch Russian state TV channels for free, will be pre-installed on all smart TVs sold in Russia from January 1 next year, the government added.\nSource: Reuters Newsletter Week in Review Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review\nOur chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.\nSign up for our newsletters Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nSubscribe here Get the CNA app Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nDownload here Get WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nJoin here Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...
