  "text": "See full bio Avinash Jaisrani At Tech4Gamers, I contribute as a News Reporter, combining my skills and gaming enthusiasm to keep our audience updated on the latest developments.\nSee full bio Story Highlight Elden Ring was announced for the Nintendo Switch 2 a while ago, but it seems to be in rough condition. Impressions from Gamescom reveal extremely poor frame rates on the console. Bandai Namco also prohibited the media from recording and sharing the footage. Elden Ring is the next big release headed to the Nintendo Switch 2 in terms of third-party titles. The game has already garnered quite a fanbase on handheld platforms like the Steam Deck, and its upcoming release also packs the critically acclaimed Shadow of the Erdtree DLC for Nintendo fans.\nHowever, it seems the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game is far from impressive. In fact, early reports from Gamescom reveal that the game is in terrible shape at the moment.\nWhy it matters: The Nintendo Switch 2 promises extensive third-party support, but games like Elden Ring and Star Wars Outlaws are already showing the console’s limits.\nAccording to impressions from IGN, the game’s performance can only be described as a disaster. Bandai Namco also told the media not to record footage from the Gamescom demo, and IGN believes this was done to hide the poor performance.\nIt is said that Elden Ring suffers from frame rate drops after the simplest of actions, such as standard camera movements, on the Nintendo Switch 2.\nSpinning the camera from left to right really showed how much the Switch 2 was struggling rendering that massive environment.\nParts of Limgrave ran similarly, while Torrent speeding through the map made things even worse.\nSince Bandai Namco did not allow the press to share footage, it’s hard to say how bad the experience truly was. However, others who played the demo reported similar problems.\nThe good news is that Elden Ring seems to be doing well in the visual department. As such, the developers may consider further visual compromises to improve performance and avoid a complete disaster.\nThe Switch 2 Port Will Ship With The DLC Content\nAs it stands, the game sounds a whole lot like Batman: Arkham Knight on the original Nintendo Switch, so these criticisms must be addressed as quickly as possible.\nWhat do you think about the first impressions of Elden Ring running on the Nintendo Switch 2? Let’s discuss in the comments and on the Tech4Gamers Forums.",
