  "text": "Nasa giant new Moon rocket looks awfully like a d$ck\nWrenfoe- 2 hours ago\n- 1 min read\nThe space agency denied they were overcompensating but acknowledged they had accepted a sponsorship deal with Viagra. The new rocket is twice as large as the space shuttle, but only half as long as Errol Flynn.\nTo a packed conference, NASA said: ‘Yes, it’s got length. But it’s also got girth. Stop giggling at the back! It’s got 15% more thrust. Stop it! And it is filled with spacemen, not seamen as some bright spark scribbled on my notes.\n‘Frankly, this penis obsession is puerile nonsense. The kind of immature speculation you would expect from those with school-boy humour. We are very proud of Starship Dildo.’\nImage from Pixabay by RJA 1988\nFirst published 21 Aug 2022\nIf you enjoyed this archive item, why not buy thousands of archive stories found in our eBooks, paperbacks and hardbacks?",
