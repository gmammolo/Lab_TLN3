  "text": "Zoom is preparing to phase out support for older iOS versions, which could affect users with corporate-issued devices that have not been updated in years. The company has noted in its latest release notes that the app will soon stop working on iOS 13 and iOS 14, pushing the minimum requirement to iOS 15. The change was spotted in version 6.5.10 of Zoom for iOS, where the release notes make reference to the “upcoming end of support for iOS 13 and iOS 14.” Although Zoom has not provided an exact timeline, the shift will happen in the near future. For most users, this is unlikely to pose a serious challenge, since every iPhone capable of running iOS 13 can also be updated to iOS 15. The situation is similar for iPads. The iPadOS release notes mention the same support cutoff, suggesting that iPadOS 13 and iPadOS 14 will also lose compatibility soon. Once again, no devices are being excluded on the hardware side. Any iPad that supported iPadOS 13 is also able to install iPadOS 15. In practical terms, this is a software decision rather than a hardware limitation. Zoom appears to be dropping older versions due to the declining number of active users still relying on them. Maintaining compatibility with outdated systems is resource intensive, and at some point companies shift focus towards more modern platforms. While personal users can usually upgrade with ease, the change could be more disruptive in enterprise environments. Many corporate devices are locked to older operating systems due to internal policies, compatibility requirements, or simply delayed IT rollouts. For employees who rely on Zoom daily for meetings and collaboration, this could mean the application will stop working if the device is not updated in time. If you are in such a situation, the recommendation is clear: contact your IT department and request an update before the cutoff takes effect. Since the hardware is still fully supported, there should be no reason for businesses to keep employees stuck on iOS 13 or iOS 14. Updating to iOS 15 or later will ensure continued access to Zoom and also improve device security and performance. Zoom’s decision underlines a broader trend in the industry, where apps are moving faster to end support for legacy software as adoption of newer systems accelerates. For Apple users, this means keeping pace with updates is no longer optional, especially for business-critical tools &nbsp; &nbsp;\",",
