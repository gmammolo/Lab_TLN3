  "text": "Industry- 1 min read\nAI raises job security fears as 71% of Americans see risk of permanent losses\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll finds 71% of Americans fear AI could permanently cost jobs, even as unemployment remains low. Respondents also voice concerns about political misuse, military applications, social impacts, and energy consumption, underscoring growing workforce and societal unease as AI adoption accelerates.\nA new\nBeyond employment, Americans are uneasy about AI’s societal and ethical implications. Some 77% fear AI could be misused to create political chaos, reflecting concerns over deepfake videos and misinformation. Military applications also raise alarm, with 48% opposing government use of AI to target military strikes, and 28% uncertain.\nEnvironmental impact is another workforce-relevant concern. About 61% of respondents are worried about the electricity demands of AI, as energy-intensive data centres strain power grids. Companies like Google are seeking solutions, such as agreements with utilities to reduce AI data center consumption during peak demand.\nPublic attitudes also reflect concerns about social and ethical effects: two-thirds fear AI companions may replace human relationships, and opinions are divided on whether AI can improve education, with 36% supportive and 40% sceptical.\nThe survey, which gathered online responses from 4,446 US adults, had a margin of error of roughly 2 percentage points. It underscores that while AI adoption accelerates across tech giants like Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft, Americans remain cautious about its broader implications for employment, society, and the environment.\nReuters/Ipsos pollreveals widespread anxiety among Americans about artificial intelligence, particularly its potential effect on employment.
