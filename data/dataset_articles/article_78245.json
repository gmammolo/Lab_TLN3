  "text": "The number of scripted TV originals ordered for production by the top six global streamers in the first half (H1) of 2025 has fallen by 24% year-on-year, according to Ampere Analysis.\nBetween them, Apple, Amazon, Disney+, HBO Max, Netflix and Paramount+ have ordered 242 first-run and renewed titles during this period, down from 318 in 2024.\nThis change follows a recessionary period caused by the streamers’ reappraisals of their originals funding strategy and the impact of the Hollywood strikes on scripted production at the end of 2023.\nAmpere has stated that the overall global TV industry saw an 8% drop in scripted commissions, excluding the top six SVODs. The top six streamers’ cuts were three times deeper, indicating a more pronounced pullback.\nWhile all the major streamers reduced their scripted commissioning volume in H1 of 2025, Netflix and Apple were reportedly the least affected, down just 6% and 4% respectively.\nAmazon Prime Video made the deepest cuts, by more than halving its scripted commissions. In the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, Amazon's pullback was found to be especially sharp. Commissions in India slipped to just a couple of titles in H1, driving a 52% regional decline in scripted output across the global streamers.\nWestern Europe also saw steep reductions, with volumes down 44%, particularly in the crime and thriller genre – a key component of the streamers’ productions in the region.\nScripted TV originals in North America held steady at 95 titles in H1, matching 2024 levels, while Latin America defied the global trend with a 17% increase.\nAmpere Analysis Research Manager Cyrine Amor said: “Several factors underpin the reduction in H1 scripted commissions. Primarily, the move reflects the streamers’ ongoing strategic shift in their business models post the era of ‘peak TV’. This is marked by reduced investments in originals, a more cautious approach to commissioning decisions, and a heavier reliance on licensing in their content strategies.\n“The uncertain economic climate and the prospect of taxation on international productions have further exacerbated these trends. Regional disparities support this picture. Ampere’s monthly data shows a brief recovery in April 2025, followed by a dip in May 2025 after new movie tariffs were announced. Greater clarity on tariffs and the broader economic outlook could drive a rebound in H2.”\nGlobal content spend will increase by just 0.4% year-on-year to reach $248bn in 2025, according to research by Ampere Analysis.
