  "text": "JPMorgan Chase (JPM) stock was in the news Wednesday following reports that it is close to funding a $22 billion data center that will be built in Texas. According to these reports, JPMorgan Chase and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (JP:8306) are in talks to provide joint funding for the planned facility. Vantage Data Centers will build and operate the facility.\nElevate Your Investing Strategy:\n- Take advantage of\nTipRanks Premium at 50% off!Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.\nThe total cost of the Vantage Data Centers project will be $25 billion. Silver Lake and DigitalBridge (DBRG), the owners of Vantage Data Centers, will provide the remaining $3 billion needed for the Texas facility. The first set of data centers at this location will be operational by mid-2026. The others will be up and running by 2028.\nJPMorgan Chase and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group’s potential massive investment in this Texas data center wouldn’t be a surprise. Artificial intelligence (AI) has continued to boom in 2025, with immense demand for the services the technology provides. Data centers are needed for these tasks, which brings with it plenty of investment opportunities. This has resulted in several similar deals announced over the past couple of years.\nJPMorgan Chase Stock Movement Today\nJPMorgan Chase stock slipped slightly alongside the data center funding report. However, the company’s stock was still up 23.13% year-to-date and 35.44% over the past 12 months. Inflation, tariffs, and other economic factors have largely affected JPM stock in 2025. If an official announcement is made about the data center funding, it could move JPM shares.\nIs JPMorgan Chase Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\nTurning to Wall Street, the analysts’ consensus rating for JPMorgan Chase is Moderate Buy, based on 10 Buy, four Hold, and two Sell ratings over the past three months. With that comes an average JPM stock price target of $307.20, representing a potential 5.77% upside for the shares.\nSee more JPM stock analyst ratings",
