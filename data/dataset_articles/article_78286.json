  "text": "2 Min Read\nReliance Jio earlier this week quietly withdrew its 1GB/day prepaid plans from the online recharge medium, a move being read as part of a broader tariff rationalisation strategy.\nDespite this shift in product availability, analysts note that Jio continues to offer the most competitive entry-level plans compared with rivals\nBharti Airteland\nVodafone Idea (Vi).\nVoice-only customers retain affordable option\nAt the bottom of the pricing pyramid, Jio has kept its ₹189 plan unchanged. This entry-level pack offers unlimited voice, SMS benefits, and 2GB of data over 28 days. The plan targets voice-first users, especially in rural and semi-urban markets, at a price point where Airtel and Vi do not offer a direct equivalent.\nFor data-focused consumers, Jio continues to maintain a pricing advantage:\n₹299 plan: 1.5GB/day for 28 days, positioned against Airtel and Vi’s equivalent offerings at ₹349. The saving of ₹50 per month builds customer stickiness.\n₹349 plan: 2GB/day for 28 days, undercutting Airtel’s ₹398 option and staying below Vi’s ₹365 pack, translating to savings of ₹49 and ₹16, respectively.\nPlan (Data/Day) | Validity | Jio | Airtel | Vi | Saving with Jio per month |\n---|---|---|---|---|---|\n1.5 GB/day | 28 days | ₹299 | ₹349 | ₹349 | ₹50 |\n2 GB/day | 28 days | ₹349 | ₹398 | ₹365 | ₹49 (vs Airtel), ₹16 (vs Vi) |\nAnalyst Jefferies noted that “a larger portion of Jio’s subscriber base is on 56/84-day duration plans.”\nAlso Read:\nReliance Jio's potential IPO to see positive impact from SEBI proposals, Citi says\nBNP Paribas said in its report, “charges from all three operators for the 28-day plan will be ₹299, with Jio still offering higher data limits versus competition. This is similar to what we have seen in the annual plans earlier, with popular plans at ₹3,599, in which Jio offers 2.5GB/day versus Airtel/VIL at 2GB/day.”\nAnalysts highlight volume advantage\nBNP Paribas in its latest telecom sector note highlighted that while all three operators—Jio, Airtel, and Vi—have aligned their headline 28-day 1.5GB/day plan pricing at ₹299–₹349, Jio continues to differentiate by offering more data at the same price points. BNP also referenced Jio’s annual ₹3,599 plan, where the operator provides 2.5GB/day, in contrast to the 2GB/day limits offered by Airtel and Vi.\nThe withdrawal of the 1GB/day packs from the online medium indicates Jio’s strategy of simplifying its portfolio and increasing ARPU while continuing to defend its value proposition on core plans.\nNote To Readers\nDisclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd, which owns Jio, is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust that controls Network18, the parent company of CNBCTV18.com.\n(Edited by : Sheersh Kapoor)\nCheck out our in-depth",
