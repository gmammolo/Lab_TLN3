  "text": "OpenAI might’ve kick-started the AI revolution but it’s having a hard time maintaining its lead, at least in the enterprise space.\nNew data reveals a shift in the enterprise AI landscape, as OpenAI’s once-dominant position in the Large Language Model (LLM) API market is being significantly challenged. According to figures from Mento Ventures, OpenAI’s market share has been cut in half since last year, with rivals like Anthropic and Google making substantial gains.\nThe Shifting Tides of Market Share In 2023, OpenAI was the undisputed leader, commanding a 50% market share of enterprise LLM API usage. This commanding lead, however, has steadily eroded.\nBy 2024, OpenAI’s share had dropped to 34%. By mid-2025, OpenAI was left with a market share of 25%, marking a 50% reduction in its market dominance over a two-and-a-half-year period.\nCapitalizing on this shift is Anthropic, which has seen explosive growth. Starting from a modest 12% in 2023, its market share doubled to 24% in 2024. The company has become the new market leader, with a share of 32% by mid-2025.\nGoogle is also on a strong upward trend. From just 7% in 2023, its share more than doubled to 16% in 2024 and is to 20% by mid-2025.\nConversely, Meta, which held a respectable 16% share in 2023, has seen its position weaken. Its share fell to 12% in 2024 and dipped further to 9% by mid-2025.\nThe Coding Market Landscape The coding market reveals a more concentrated distribution of power. Anthropic is the clear leader here, with a 42% market share. It is followed by OpenAI at 21%, Google at 16% and Meta at 10%. Other AI providers — including presumably some Chinese names — account for the remaining 11%.\nOpenAI’s Consumer Strength vs Relative Enterprise Weakness It increasingly seems to appear that OpenAI is moving towards providing more consumer-focused AI offerings. Its market-share in website traffic has remained steady over the last year in the high 70 percent range, and players like Google, Anthropic and Meta have been unable to make much of a dent. ChatGPT has become the AI of choice for a large number of casual users, and it appears that the release of some very capable models from other companies isn’t yet making them switch\nOn the other hand, developers and companies be keeping a closer eye on AI developments, and seem to be experimenting with offerings from other players. Anthropic shines here with its coding models, while Google has large context windows and affordable prices. And while ChatGPT’s 25% share in the enterprise API space is nothing to be sneezed at, it doesn’t compare to the 78% traffic share that ChatGPT gets from consumers. And these data points suggest a future where OpenAI becomes more of a consumer-focused player with ChatGPT, while a host of other companies vie among themselves for API business from enterprise clients.",
