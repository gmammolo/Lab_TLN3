  "text": "A recent online claim revealed that popular gaming platform Roblox will shut down permanently on September 1, 2025. The viral notice soon sent shock waves in its global community.\nTired of too many ads? go ad free now The alleged announcement, circulating widely on social media platform X, cites user demand and safety concerns as the reasons for the shutdown. The statement The announcement, styled to resemble an official statement, reads: “While this was not an easy choice, we believe it is in the best interest of our community. Your voices have been heard, and your well-being remains our top priority.” Despite its widespread reach, Roblox Corporation has not issued any formal confirmation, leaving millions of users in suspense.\nLegal pressure and global bans add fuel to the fire\nThe timing of this viral notice coincides with the intensifying legal scrutiny and international bans. Recently, multiple countries include Turkey, Oman, China and Qatar have blocked access to Roblox over the concerns about inappropriate content and child safety. A lawsuit filed by the state of Louisiana accuses Roblox of failing to protect minors from explicit and games and online predators. The lawsuit also gave examples of Escape to Epstein Island and Diddy Party games.\nBoth the games were accused of containing disturbing content. Roblox Responds: “We’re not going anywhere”\nAs reported by PCGamesN, Roblox Corporation has reassured users that the platform is not shutting down. The company is also posting continuous updates and is also engaging with its community. The company has also dismissed the shutdown claims and said that it is part of a recurring hoax. Roblox’s official X account previously stated: “Let’s set things straight: Roblox isn’t ‘shutting down.’\nTired of too many ads? go ad free now The same hoax (with a few details changed) goes around every year or two. Remember: don’t believe everything y’all read on the internet! As of now, Roblox remains fully functional. But the platform’s future may depend on how it addresses growing concerns around content moderation, child safety, and regulatory compliance.\nAI Masterclass for Students.
