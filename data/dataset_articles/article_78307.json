  "text": "A new study reveals heavy metal concentrations in high-traffic areas are ten times higher than 40 years ago, coinciding with a six-fold increase in annual tourist numbers\nScientists have issued a warning about growing pollution in Antarctica, caused by rising numbers of tourists and expanding research activities. This comes as another challenge for the continent, which is already suffering due to climate change driven by human actions.\nHow much has pollution increased?\nIn areas of Antarctica where human activity has taken place, levels of fine particles containing heavy metals such as nickel, copper, zinc, and lead have risen to ten times what they were four decades ago.\nWhat’s driving the pollution?\nThe number of visitors to Antarctica has jumped dramatically over the last 20 years, climbing from 20,000 to 120,000 tourists annually, according to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators.\nThese tourists arrive aboard ships that burn fossil fuels, releasing fine particles that contribute to pollution. Transportation methods including aircraft, vehicles, and the supporting infrastructure used for expeditions also add to the fossil fuel emissions, raising concerns about contaminants.\nHow does pollution affect antarctica’s environment?\nFine particles carried on snow in tourist-frequented areas cause the snow to melt faster. A scientist from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands explained that the presence of polluting particles from just one tourist can speed up the melting of about 100 tons of snow.\nScientific research efforts, especially those involving longer stays, have an even greater impact on pollution. According to experts, a prolonged research project can result in pollution levels 10 times higher than those from a single tourist visit.\nAn international team of scientists, including researchers from Chile and Germany, conducted a four-year study. They travelled approximately 2,000 kilometres through Antarctica to carefully measure pollution levels and trace the growth of heavy metal contamination.\nAre efforts being made to protect antarctica?\nThe study notes that there have been important improvements in protecting the continent from pollution. For example, a ban has been placed on highly polluting heavy fuel oils, and the tourism industry has begun to use electric-hybrid ships to reduce emissions.\nDespite these advances, the researchers emphasised that much more needs to be done. They stressed the importance of accelerating the shift to renewable energy sources and significantly cutting back on fossil fuel consumption to lessen the environmental burden caused by human activity in Antarctica.\nHow does this pollution tie into climate change?\nAnother study published in the same scientific journal warned about the potentially irreversible effects of climate change on Antarctica. The melting of ice caused by warming temperatures could raise global sea levels by metres, leading to catastrophic consequences that would affect coming generations worldwide.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\nFollow\nDisclaimer: Kindly avoid objectionable, derogatory, unlawful and lewd comments, while responding to reports.
