  "text": "Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated third-party games coming to the Nintendo Switch 2. FromSoftware has clearly shown its support for the console, as it's also working on an exclusive called The Duskbloods for the console. However, it's been a while, and we've heard little to nothing about either of the two.\nIt seems Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition has shown up at Gamescom 2025, with only a select few being allowed to check it out. Unfortunately, the Tarnished Edition isn't quite getting the same praise that the base game got. It reportedly suffers from major performance issues on the Nintendo Switch 2.\nElden Ring Switch 2 Port Is Suffering From Major Performance Issues\nAs reported by Nintendo Life, who were among the few to try out the game, Elden Ring: Tarnished edition doesn't run quite as well on the Switch 2 as other triple-A third party titles, like Cyberpunk 2077. You'd think that if the console could run CD Projekt Red's RPG, Elden Ring wouldn't be a problem. Apparently, that's not the case.\n“It’s really bad, and I understand why they don’t want you to see this, because wowie zowie, it is terrible,” said Nintendo Life's Felix Sanchez (via Kotaku). “Of course, you’re never going to see the light of this—maybe it will just release in that state, but I can’t imagine they will do that—It was like playing Ocarina of Time. It was like 20 frames per second, sometimes I was like, ‘This has dropped [to] 15 frames per second.'”\nThis isn't something you'd expect from FromSoftware, especially given how well received Elden Ring has been, and how much time the devs had to work on the port. It's clearly not a case of the Switch 2's capabilities, as Cyberpunk 2077 has demonstrated. It looks like we're going to be waiting a while longer for the Tarnished Edition, as Bandai Namco wasn't even allowing testers to capture footage.\nSanchez revealed that the game felt unstable even in relatively closed off areas like caves and rooms, and despite there being only a few other characters on screen.\nElden Ring: Tarnished Edition\n-\nOpenCritic Reviews - Top Critic Avg: 95/100 Critics Rec: 98%\n- Released\n- 2025\n- ESRB\n- Mature 17+ // Blood and Gore, Language, Suggestive Themes, Violence\n- Developer(s)\n-\nFromSoftware - Publisher(s)\n-\nBandai Namco Entertainment - Multiplayer\n- Online Multiplayer\n- Number of Players\n- Single-player",
