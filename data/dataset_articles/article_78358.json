  "text": "How the fake VPN scam empties accounts… If your phone is where you text, shop and do your banking, it’s also where crooks want to be. The latest trick looks respectable at first glance: a ‘free, unlimited VPN ‘ promising privacy and protection. You tap install , grant a couple of permissions and feel safer. In reality, some of these apps are doing the opposite – snooping on notifications (including one-time passcodes), placing fake login screens over your banking app, and quietly sending your passwords and account numbers elsewhere. Researchers say reports linked to these imposters surged in late 2024, which tracks with what banks are seeing: transactions approved before victims even realise anything’s wrong.\nThe sales pitch works because it sounds sensible. A VPN is supposed to shield your traffic. But bandwidth costs money; truly “free and unlimited” has to be paid for somehow. If that “somehow” is your data, the price quickly becomes obvious.\nSix fake ‘free’ VPNs to remove today Security analysts have singled out six VPNs that are anything but protective: MaskVPN, DewVPN, PaladinVPN, ProxyGate, ShieldVPN and ShineVPN . They pop up via sponsored posts, pop-ups, download links in messages, and sometimes even slip through to app stores. Some make a show of connecting to a server so everything looks legit, while the malware gets to work in the background. If you spot any of those names on your handset, bin them now.\nWhat to do if one’s on your phone (and how to stay safe) Don’t panic; just move briskly. Uninstall the suspect app, then run a scan with a reputable mobile security tool. Change your banking and email passwords from another device (not the phone you’re fixing) and switch on two-factor authentication if you haven’t already. It’s also worth opening your settings and reining in permissions you don’t recognise – things like Accessibility or Notification access can be misused to read codes and overlay fake screens. On Android, check that ‘install from unknown sources’ is off.\nKeep an eye on your accounts for a few days and set up spending alerts so you get a nudge the moment something odd happens. If you see a transaction you don’t recognise, call your bank straight away and follow its fraud process; the sooner you shout, the better your chances of stopping further damage. If the phone still behaves strangely after you’ve cleaned house, back up your photos and reset it to factory settings, then reinstall only the apps you actually use – from official stores.\nGoing forward, pick your privacy tools the way you’d pick a bank: look at who’s behind them, how long they’ve been around, and what data they say they collect. Glance through the recent reviews – genuine ones mention specifics; fake ones sound like they were written by a bot in a hurry. And treat ‘free, unlimited’ with healthy scepticism. Good VPNs usually charge a modest fee because running servers around the world isn’t cheap.\nYour phone should be the safest thing in your pocket, not a pickpocket’s dream. If you see MaskVPN, DewVPN, PaladinVPN, ProxyGate, ShieldVPN or ShineVPN on your device, delete them today, tidy up your security settings and give your passwords a refresh. Five minutes now is a lot easier than months of chasing a stolen identity.\nStay tuned with Euro Weekly News for the latest news about Technology\nShare this story\nSign up for personalised news Subscribe to our Euro Weekly News alerts to get the latest stories into your inbox!\nDaily Weekly By signing up, you will create a Euro Weekly News account if you don't already have one.
