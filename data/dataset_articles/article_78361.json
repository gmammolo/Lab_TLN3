  "text": "Faix RG, Laptook AR, Shankaran S. Data and Analysis Concerns in Trial of Whole-Body Hypothermia for Neonatal Encephalopathy in Preterm Infants—Reply. JAMA Pediatr. 2025;179(8):925–926. doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2025.1441\nIn Reply Groenendaal and El-Dib and Inder report concerns about the moderate number of infants with 33 to 35 weeks’ gestational age (GA) in our randomized clinical trial (RCT) of hypothermia vs normothermia for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).1 Although the Neonatal Research Network is large (19 US academic centers), prestudy review of participating centers admission records suggested inadequate patient numbers over 5 years for conventional (“frequentist”) analysis with 5% type I error and 80% power. This prompted a bayesian approach. In our trial, hypothermia was associated with no benefit for the primary outcome (death or moderate/severe disability), 74% probability of harm, and 87% probability for death alone after more than 18 months, which merits serious consideration. We agree that larger RCTs with long-term outcomes would be useful but difficult to orchestrate.\nCustomize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.",
