  "title": "Sony Announces $50 Price Hike For PlayStation 5 Consoles In U.S.: Here's How Much They Will Cost Now",
  "text": "Sony has announced a price hike for its PlayStation 5 lineup in the U.S. starting today (August 21). This increase in price will affect all three models – the standard PS5 (disc version), the PS5 Digital Edition, and the PS5 Pro. Each model will be hiked by $50 in the U.S. market. Sony cited the challenging economic environment as the reason behind the move.\nWith the new price changes, the PS5 (disc version) will now cost $549.99, up from $499.99 in the U.S. The PS5 Digital Edition will also see a $50 jump, bringing its new price to $499.99. Meanwhile, the high-end PS5 Pro will retail at $749.99, reflecting the same $50 increase.\nSony’s Vice President of Global Marketing, Isabelle Tomatis, said in a statement that like many global businesses, the company is facing economic pressures. As a result, it has made the “difficult decision” to raise the retail prices of its consoles in the U.S.\nThe price hike comes during Gamescom week, a time when the gaming industry sees multiple big announcements. The timing also follows similar moves by other companies – Nintendo recently raised the cost of the original Switch, while Asus avoided disclosing a price for its upcoming ROG Xbox Ally X handheld, citing ongoing macro-economic challenges.\nSony has previously increased PS5 prices in other regions, including the UK, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as back in 2022 when the console’s cost was adjusted for the first time.\nFor now, the price increase applies only to PS5 consoles in the U.S. There has been no word on price hikes of the accessories and consoles in other markets.\nThe global demand for consoles is soaring high and economic factors still continue to play a role, deeming Sony to take this step to navigate the challenges in the gaming industry.\nGet latest Tech and Auto news from Techlusive on ourAuthor Name | Shubham Arora\nSelect Language",
