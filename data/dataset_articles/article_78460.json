  "text": "403\nSorry!!\nError! We're sorry, but the page you were looking for doesn't exist.\nNasdaq Forecast 21/08: Plunges As AI Stocks Drop (Chart)\n(\nMENAFN- Daily Forex)- NASDAQ 100 plunged during the trading session on Wednesday, as we continue to see a lot of volatility in trading. All things being equal, this is a market that continues to see a lot of volatility, and as we start heading toward the Jackson Hole Symposium statements, I think a lot of traders are worried about the idea of Jerome Powell not being as dovish as once thought, and I think we've got a situation where traders are starting to panic on the idea that perhaps cheap money will be coming as rapidly as stock.\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
