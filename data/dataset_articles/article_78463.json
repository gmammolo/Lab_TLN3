  "text": "Ethereum News Today: Ethereum ETFs Face $197M Outflow as Unstaking Surge Puzzles Market\n- BlackRock’s ETHA ETF saw $87M outflow on Aug 18, the largest among Ethereum ETFs that day, as total outflows hit $196.7M, the second-highest since launch.\n- Ethereum prices fell 6.5% amid a record 910,000 ETH unstaking queue, raising concerns about further price pressure from increased supply.\n- Despite outflows, Ethereum ETFs outperformed Bitcoin ETFs in inflows, with ETHA holding 58% of Ethereum ETF assets, reflecting institutional confidence.\n- Market analysts warn of potential deeper ETH price declines below $4,100 if outflows persist, amid a tug-of-war between ETF inflows and selling pressure.\nBlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) experienced a significant outflow of $87 million on August 18, according to Farside data, making it the largest single-issuer outflow among Ethereum ETFs that day. This marked part of a broader trend as spot Ethereum ETFs collectively recorded $196.7 million in outflows, the second-largest daily outflow since their launch, following a $465 million outflow on August 4. The decline in ETHA’s holdings reduced its asset value from approximately $15.8 billion to $15.6 billion over the weekend, as Ethereum prices dropped around 6.5% during the same period [1].\nThe sell-off came amid a surge in Ethereum unstaking demand, with the unstaking queue reaching an all-time high of 910,000 ETH, valued at around $3.9 billion, as of August 20. Validators now face a minimum wait time of 15 days and 14 hours to unstake their tokens, according to ValidatorQueue data [1]. Analysts have raised concerns that this growing unstaking activity could signal an “unstakening,” a scenario where the supply of unstaked ETH increases, potentially pressuring prices further. Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow, for example, suggested that ETH’s value in terms of BTC could fall to “0.03 or lower,” as ETH currently traded at 0.036 BTC at the time of reporting [1].\nDespite these outflows, Ethereum ETFs have continued to outperform Bitcoin ETFs in terms of inflows over the preceding weeks. According to Hildobby, an analyst at Dragonfly, the percentage of Ethereum’s total supply held in ETFs reached 5% as of August 18, compared to 6.4% for Bitcoin. If this trend continues, Ethereum ETFs may surpass Bitcoin ETFs in supply ownership by late August or early September [1]. This shift reflects growing institutional and retail investor preference for Ethereum, which offers features like staking rewards and smart contract functionality that Bitcoin does not [4].\nBlackRock remains the dominant player in the Ethereum ETF space, with ETHA holding 3.49 million ETH—approximately 58.03% of the total assets under management in Ethereum ETFs. This position was further reinforced as ETHA attracted $520 million in inflows on August 13 alone. In contrast, Grayscale’s Ethereum fund added 12,837 ETH in a single day, and another unnamed ETF added 59,014 ETH [6]. These figures underscore the institutional confidence in Ethereum despite recent price volatility and ETF outflows.\nThe broader market context highlights a tug-of-war between ETF inflows and market sell-offs. While Ethereum ETFs have seen over $12 billion in net inflows since their launch, the $196.6 million outflow on August 18 came after an eight-day streak of $3.7 billion in inflows. This reversal has raised questions about the sustainability of Ethereum’s rally and whether institutional demand can absorb potential selling pressure from both retail and algorithmic trading activity [2]. At the same time, Ethereum’s price remains under pressure, having dropped below $4,100 following the ETF sell-off, with some analysts warning of a deeper retracement to the mid-$3,000 range if the outflows continue [3].\nSource:\n[1] Spot Ether ETFs See $197M Outflows, Second-Largest Ever (https://cointelegraph.com/news/ether-etfs-197m-outflows-second-largest)\n[2] Ethereum ETFs Experience $196.6M Outflow, Led by BlackRock, Fidelity (https://coincentral.com/ethereum-etfs-experience-196-6m-outflow-led-by-blackrock-fidelity/)\n[3] Ethereum Sell-Offs: Outflows Rock Crash Below ...
