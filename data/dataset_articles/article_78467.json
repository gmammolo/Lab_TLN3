  "text": "Social media platforms have become prime targets for both hackers and scammers. Hackers use technical skills to gain unauthorized access to accounts, while scammers employ deception to trick users into revealing their vital information, sending money, or stealing digital assets, such as crypto or non-fungible token collections. Phantom, a renowned multi-chain crypto and non-fungible token wallet services provider, has revealed fake Google Ads targeting non-fungible token and crypto investors.\nPhantom Flags Fake Google Ads In an August 21 blog post, the Phantom cybersecurity team has unmasked the latest tricks hackers and scammers are using to swindle crypto and non-fungible token investors. The security team has revealed that if you Google the phrase “Phantom”, the sponsored result might NOT be from them. Instead, you’ll be directed to a malicious website designed to steal your digital assets like cryptocurrencies or non-fungible token collections.\nThese sites are designed to look identical to ours, but you’ll be prompted to enter your seed phrase immediately. Phantom will never do this.\n🔍 How to stay safe:\n❌ Never enter your secret recover phrase online\n⚠️ Double-check the domain name before clicking\n✅ Bookmark…\n— Phantom (@phantom) August 20, 2025\nLaunched in 2021, Phantom Wallet is a non-custodial cryptocurrency and non-fungible token wallet. Similar to other Web3 wallets, Phantom also allows you to interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and applications (DApps). Although it was initially designed for the Solana blockchain, Phantom now supports multiple chains, including Solana, Ethereum, Base, Polygon, and Bitcoin.\nPhantom Wallet is considered one of the safest and trusted crypto wallets. Phantom Wallet is renowned for offering a Scam detection system, which automatically identifies and blocks certain malicious transactions. Notably, Phantom Wallet is non-custodial, so it doesn’t hold your private keys and seed phrases, meaning that users have total control over their keys and digital assets. These key factors make it a go-to option for users managing assets across diverse ecosystems.\nPhantom NFT wallet was founded in San Francisco, California, by Brandon Millman, Chris Kalani, and Francesco Agost. It is a great crypto and NFT wallet, especially due to its smooth user experience and easy staking options. It has enhanced features, including multi-chain support, phishing protection, NFT tools, and staking rewards of up to 9% APY on Solana. Phantom claims to have over 15 million monthly active users, and has overseen $20 billion in annual swap volume and $25 billion in self-custody assets.\nHow To Stay Safe From Fake Google Ads In 2025 In 2025, the crypto and non-fungible token market is experiencing a resurgence, attracting the emergence of scams and hacks. In recent weeks. There are many fake websites created due to the increasing sophistication of AI-powered scams, which allow crypto scammers to establish more convincing and realistic fake websites and social media profiles, as well as the ease with which they can be spread through various online channels, social media platforms like X, search engine ads on Google, and even through direct messages.\nBased on the Phantom investigation team, these websites are designed to look identical to theirs, but they’ll be prompted to enter the user’s seed phrase immediately. In such a case, “Phantom will never do this.” The security has warned that crypto and non-fungible token investors on Google should never enter their secret recovery phrase online. Moreover, they should double-check the Phantom domain name before clicking on it.\nCommon NFT Scams And How To Avoid Them Fake giveaways and airdrops are one of the latest crypto scams targeting crypto and non-fungible token investors. This scam promises free tokens or NFTs to trick or lure you into clicking a malicious link. Once you click the link, which is usually found in a fake Google ad, it directs you to a malicious website to connect your wallet or approve a transaction. If you do, it’ll drain your wallet.\nDeceptive messages and links in Discord, Telegram, and Twitter are another common scam trick targeting crypto and non-fungible token investors. In this case, NFT scammers often disguise themselves as members of an NFT community, crypto company, or even your friend group. When they do, they’ll likely send you a direct message offering help or support in exchange for money or sensitive information, such as your seed phrase. They’re trying to get your money, digital assets, or both. The InsideBitcoins news team is advising all crypto and NFT holders to stay vigilant in 2025.\nRelated NFT News: Best Wallet - Diversify Your Crypto Portfolio\nOur Rating\nEasy to Use, Feature-Driven Crypto Wallet Get Early Access to Upcoming Token ICOs Multi-Chain, Multi-Wallet, Non-Custodial Now On App Store, Google Play Stake To Earn Native Token $BEST 250,000+ Monthly Active Users Download Now",
