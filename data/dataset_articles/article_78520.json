  "text": "Digital- 2 min read\nChina's Baidu revenue drops as AI returns fail to offset ad decline\nBaidu, the Chinese search engine giant, reported a 4 per cent drop in second-quarter revenue to 32.71 billion yuan, slightly below analysts' expectations, as its core advertising business suffered from China's economic slowdown. While cloud revenue grew by 27 per cent, it couldn't compensate for the 15 per cent decline in online ad revenue.\nHighlights\n- Baidu reported a second quarter revenue of 32.71 billion yuan ($4.56 billion), falling short of the forecasted 32.76 billion yuan and marking a 4% decline from the previous year.\n- The company's core online advertising business experienced a significant 15% drop in revenue, contributing to the overall decline, while the cloud business grew by 27% to 6.5 billion yuan.\n- Chief Executive Officer Robin Li emphasized a cautious strategy for monetizing artificial intelligence features, prioritizing user experience despite the challenges in converting AI investments into substantial advertising revenue.\nChinese search engine company Baidu on Wednesday reported a drop in second quarter revenue as its core advertising business struggled amid China's economic slowdown, while returns from\nThe company reported total revenue of 32.71 billion yuan ($4.56 billion) during the three months ended June 30, down 4% from the same period a year earlier. Analysts on average estimated quarterly revenue at 32.76 billion yuan, according to data compiled by LSEG.\nOn an adjusted basis, Baidu made a profit of 13.58 yuan per American Depositary Share, beating expectations of 13.12 yuan.\nBaidu's U.S.-listed shares were down 3% in early trading.\nHit by a property market downturn, weak employment rates and choppy consumer demand, companies in China, the world's second-largest economy, have reined in advertising spending to cut costs and protect their margins.\nThe squeeze has spilled over to affect Baidu, which relies heavily on advertising in its search engine. Its core online advertising business, which typically makes up 60% of overall company revenue, saw revenue decrease 15% to 16.2 billion yuan during the April-June quarter.\nCloud business revenue grew 27% to 6.5 billion yuan, but failed to offset the advertising decline.\n\"In the short term, AI will not fully offset advertising headwinds,\" said Eric Shen, analyst at consultancy Third Bridge. \"While AI tools like Ernie Bot can slow the decline by retaining users, they have not yet translated into meaningful ad revenue.\"\nBaidu has invested heavily in artificial intelligence in recent years. Last month, it launched a redesigned search interface that it called the biggest overhaul in a decade.\nBy July, 64% of mobile search result pages contained AI-generated content.\nChief Executive Robin Li said on a post-earnings call that the company would take a prudent approach to monetising AI features, keeping user experience as its top priority.\n($1 = 7.1784 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru, Liam Mo in Beijing.
