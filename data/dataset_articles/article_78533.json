  "text": "ISKANDAR PUTERI: The Johor government has ordered a data centre project in Nusabayu here to cease operations immediately after residents complained of noise, late-night activity, dusty roads and the lack of proper hoarding.\nState Housing and Local Government Committee chairman Datuk Mohd Jafni Md Shukor said the project, under the Iskandar Puteri City Council (MBIP), was the first in Johor to be slapped with a stop-work notice for breaching conditions.\n\"All data centre projects are subject to stringent guidelines and thorough vetting by the Johor Data Centre Development Coordination Committee and the State Planning Committee.\n\"Developers must comply with technical, safety and community wellbeing requirements without compromise,\" he said after visiting the site today.\nJafni said the developer has two weeks to install hoarding, cease night works, keep roads clean, stop earthworks and ensure residents are not disturbed.\nMBIP has been instructed to step up monitoring and take enforcement action under the Street, Drainage and Building Act 1974 for any breach.\nHe said that while data centres are a key pillar of Johor's digital economy and the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ), the government would prioritise community welfare.\nCurrently, Johor has 13 operating data centres, 15 under construction and 14 approved for development, with eight new applications under review.",
