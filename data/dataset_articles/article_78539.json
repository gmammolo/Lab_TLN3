  "text": "Nothing is going well for the next game of the BioShock license, which has been in development for more than ten years. Indeed, 30% of the developers have been laid off, and the release date for this new game has also been reported. These are dark times for a big name in the video game industry. According to Bloomberg , Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. has laid off around a third of the staff at Cloud Chamber , the studio responsible for the development of BioShock 4 , which had only 250 employees. In other words, 80 employees have lost their jobs as part of a company reorganization, as specified in the email sent to staff by Take-Two spokesman David Ismailer : \" While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development. ” And that's not all, as the release date for BioShock 4 has also been delayed. Thus, we will definitely have to be patient again if we want to play it, as it should be unveiled to the public between the end of 2026 and the beginning of 2027. As a result, fans who have been waiting for BioShock 4 since 2014 are starting to get impatient. And with the layoffs and internal difficulties, many questions remain about the game's release, as well as its development. However, according to Bloomberg, the game seems to be good , and currently, different points are being reworked in order to make it excellent. In addition, 2K announced this week the arrival of a new studio director named Rod Fergusson . And this may well be the missing piece of the puzzle, because he is known for his role as a conciliator and his ability to successfully complete projects that are facing significant challenges.
