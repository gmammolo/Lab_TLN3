  "text": "8th January 2026 – (Hong Kong) A 36-year-old woman, identified as Choi, was confirmed dead after falling from the Oi Tak House at Yau Oi Estate in Tuen Mun at around 8.10pm on 7th January. Paramedics attended the scene, but despite efforts to revive her, she was pronounced dead upon arrival at Tuen Mun Hospital.\nInitial investigations by the police revealed that Choi was a resident of the building. It was reported by her boyfriend that she was found lying on the building’s canopy, leading police to suspect that she had fallen from a height. Upon arrival, paramedics found her unconscious, and she was taken to the hospital, where her death was later confirmed. Authorities believe she fell from an internal staircase, and no suicide note has been discovered at the scene. The exact cause of death is pending further examination.\nThe case is currently being handled by the Tuen Mun District Crime Unit’s first team. Reports indicate that after alerting the authorities, Choi’s boyfriend has since gone missing.\nIf you are experiencing suicidal thoughts or depression, please reach out to The Samaritans Hong Kong 24-hour multilingual hotline at 28960000.
