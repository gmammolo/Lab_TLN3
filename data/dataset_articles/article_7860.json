  "text": "By James Tutten ,\n16 hours ago Inspections are ongoing after two apartment buildings in Altamonte Springs were declared unsafe last year.\nOfficials said they found between 434 and 436 for safety issues at the Altamonte Terrace apartment complex during previous inspections.\nResidents at the Altamonte Terrace complex have expressed worries about the overall safety of their living conditions over the past year.\nThe ongoing inspections aim to determine whether any other buildings will also be deemed unsafe.\nThe inspection process is expected to take another 30 days before a complete review of the complex is finished.\nClick here to download our free news, weather and smart TV apps.
