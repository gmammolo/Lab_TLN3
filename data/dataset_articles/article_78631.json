  "text": "The National Science Foundation will stop operating the Nathaniel B. Palmer icebreaker and slash polar science funding by 70 percent, devastating Antarctic research\n—a 130-kilometer-wide conveyor belt of ice that slides off West Antarctica’s coast and splinters into the sea. Thwaites is rapidly destabilizing, and precise mapping of the seafloor and ocean currents surrounding it are urgently needed to know how much damage the crumbling glacier and resulting sea-level rise could do to coasts worldwide. Only one vessel—the U.S.\nThis latest move caps what feels like a major U.S. retreat from Antarctica, says Theodore Scambos, a polar glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder. For 27 years, the U.S. had operated two research icebreakers in the region. But in 2024 NSF dropped its lease for the smaller of the two craft because of budget shortfalls. That and the impending loss of themarks “a general decline of America in the science and exploration fields,” Scambos says. “And I hate that.\nA few other countries have research icebreakers, including the U.K., Germany, Australia, South Korea and China. It is possible that a couple U.S. researchers could occasionally find ride-along spots. But that may not advance U.S. research priorities, Scambos says: “You’re not going to get somebody else’s icebreaker to bring you and 20 of your colleagues and undertake a major mission that has U.S. research interest behind it.\nBut spending an ensuing decade without a research icebreaker could have major geopolitical consequences. Antarctica is Earth’s largest remaining territory not unilaterally controlled by any particular nation. The U.S. has long backed the Antarctic Treaty, under which nations set aside any territorial land claims they’ve made and reserve the continent for scientific research.\nUnited States Latest News, United States Headlines\nSimilar News:You can also read news stories similar to this one that we have collected from other news sources.\nThe Democratic governors countering Texas redistricting and federal cuts to vaccine research: Morning RundownPlatforms editor for NBC News\nRead more »\nHow Cuts to Research Funding Could Affect Medical StudentsThe NIH plans to cap indirect research grants at 15%, down from the current average of 27%-28%.
