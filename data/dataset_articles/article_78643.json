The company's stock is expected to continue its downward trend, with predictions suggesting a potential drop to as low as $0.27296 by the end of 2025. This bearish outlook is supported by various technical indicators, including moving averages and the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which currently stands at 38.09, indicating oversold conditions.\nRecent financial reports from Datavault AI have shown mixed results.
