  "text": "Next Article\nOla Electric shares plunge around 8% today: What's the reason?\nWhat's the story\nOla Electric Mobility's shares fell around 8% today, after a massive two-day rally of nearly 30%.\nThe drop came after the latest data from the VAHAN portal showed that rival electric two-wheeler manufacturer Ather Energy has surpassed Ola in total monthly registrations for August.\nThe data may have prompted some investors to book profits, leading to the decline in share value.\nRegistration comparison\nAther Energy outpaces Ola Electric in August sales\nAccording to the VAHAN portal data, Ola Electric has recorded 9,681 registrations so far in August. This is lower than Ather Energy's 10,283 registrations for the same period.\nIn total registrations for 2025, Ola Electric leads with 1,42,858 against Ather Energy's 1,08,424.\nThe registration data comparison highlights the competitive landscape between these two electric vehicle manufacturers.\nGrowth plans\nOla's recent gains and growth strategy\nDespite the recent dip in shares, Ola Electric has gained over 23% in the past week.\nThe firm's founder and chairman Bhavish Aggarwal recently unveiled an ambitious growth strategy at its annual Sankalp event.\nHe said that Ola aims to capture a 25-30% share of India's two-wheeler EV market through vertical integration and new product launches.\nFinancial outlook\nFinancial performance and profitability challenges\nOla Electric posted a consolidated net loss of ₹428 crore in Q1 FY26, an improvement over the ₹870 crore loss in Q4 FY25 but a decline from the ₹347 crore loss in Q1 FY25.
