This study aimed to examine the stability of anterior open bite (AOB) treatment with clear aligners. This retrospective cohort study included 52 adult AOB patients (aged >18 years; 15 males, 37 females) who underwent nonextraction clear aligner treatment and were at least 1 year posttreatment. Eleven cephalometric measurements were evaluated at pretreatment, end of active treatment, and at least 1-year posttreatment. Overbite change, the primary outcome variable, and other cephalometric changes during treatment and retention were calculated, and repeated measures analysis of variance were performed. Stepwise multiple regression was used to make a prediction equation for open bite relapse. Results The mean retention period was 2.1 ± 1.1 years. The mean change in overbite during treatment was 3.3 ± 1.5 mm; 6% of patients presented relapse at least 1 year after treatment completion. The mean change of overbite (0.2 ± 0.5 mm) during the retention period was not statistically significant (P = 0.59). None of the 11 cephalometric measurements showed significant change during the retention period. The prediction model showed that only the coefficient for a tongue posture issue at the initial examination was statistically significant. AOB was successfully corrected in all 52 patients using only clear aligners with no additional adjunctive aids such as microimplants. When retained with maxillary and mandibular fixed retainers and maxillary and mandibular vacuum-formed retainers, there was no significant change in cephalometric measurements during the short-term retention pe Reference: Short-term stability of anterior open bite treatment with clear aligners in adults.
