  "text": "Garlic image\nPerspective from Faith Seke PhD, Agronomy and Crop Science (ongoing), Master’s degree, Food Science and Technology · 1 years of experience · South Africa Possible Side Effects\nIndividuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease must consult healthcare professionals as consuming garlic might trigger heartburn. Individuals taking blood thinners should seek assistance when considering increasing garlic intake because it might interact with the medication. Quantity Recommendation\n1-2 cloves of garlic everyday can help in the well functioning of the body, when taking garlic in supplement form it is recommended that one takes about 3600 mg of the extract a day. → Garlic: How much should you eat? Experts weigh in.\n→ See benefits of Garlic from this expert\nPerspective from Kiran Dhaliwal Master’s Degree Nutrition and Dietetics · 3 years of experience · Australia Possible Side Effects\nGarlic is high in fructans and may cause individuals to experience indigestion, diarrhoea and intestinal gas especially if they are fructan intolerant. As garlic has antithrombotic properties, it may prevent blood clots from forming. This may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if taking blood thinner or about to undergo a medical procedure. When taking garlic avoid taking fish oil or vitamin E. Also avoid using other supplements with garlic as this may affect blood clotting. People that have gastroesophageal reflux may want to decrease their garlic intake as garlic may decrease the lower esophageal sphincter tone which is the muscle that prevents acid from entering. This is very dependent on the individual, as it may not cause symptoms in some. Quantity Recommendation\nGarlic poses very minimal safety issues and having allergies are quite rare. If you are using it for cholesterol benefits, please check your levels after three months. The recommended amount of garlic daily ranges from half to one whole clove per day. Cooking the garlic before eating can help with acid reflux, garlic breath and digestive issues. → Garlic: How much should you eat?
