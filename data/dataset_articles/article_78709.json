  "text": "YouTube comment sections under the 2024 Toyota RAV4's review are blowing up with praise on how great the RAV is and with complaints about how small the infotainment screen size is in the entry-level trims. Remember that the lower trims of the [2024 RAV4 vehicles](https://www.torquenews.com/1/5-things-know-about-2024-toyota-rav4) come with an 8.0-inch touchscreen, but the Limited and the TRD Off-Road get a 10.5-inch display. - \"That screen is the size of a phone! At least give us an option to upgrade.\" - \"Screen straight outta the 90s. Plus, clunky controls, no wireless charging, and no USB-C? Come on, Toyota!\" - \"CR-V's got RAV4 beat on the tech front, hands down.\" Ouch. So, what's the deal? Why the screen size fuss? Bigger is Better (for Most Drivers): Let's face it, bigger screens are just...easier. Easier to see, easier to touch, easier to navigate. They feel modern, sophisticated. In a world dominated by tablets and iPhones, a tiny screen in your car can feel like a step back. More Than Just Size: Of course, it's not just about inches. It's about the whole infotainment experience. A bigger screen opens up possibilities: clearer maps, split-screen views, and better integration with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. And let's not forget the fun stuff - watching videos while parked, passengers enjoying movies on road trips. Competition Heats Up: The RAV4 isn't the only compact SUV in town. [Honda's CR-V](https://www.torquenews.com/honda-cr-v), for example, boasts a standard 7-inch touchscreen, with a larger 9-inch upgrade available. That's already a step ahead of the base RAV4. And other competitors are offering even bigger screens and more advanced features. As I mentioned above the RAV4's entry level touchscreen has the size of 8.0 inch, but apparently an upgrade isn't available for the entry trims. RAV4 owners are asking for this upgrade as an option. Drivers are speaking loud and clear. They want a RAV4 that keeps up with the times, tech-wise. Offering a bigger screen option, at least in the higher trim levels, would be a smart move. It would make the RAV4 more competitive, improve driver satisfaction, and maybe even silence those YouTube commenters. So, Toyota, what do you say? Time to give the RAV4's infotainment system a much-needed upgrade? Let's upgrade the infotainment screen size in the 2025 RAV4 please. Bonus: This video from Torque News Youtube channel is about Toyota Corolla, but you can also apply it to the RAV4's touchscreen if you want to change the sound system volume.

Comments [I notice all the complainers…](/1/toyota-rav4-needs-big-screen-upgrade-entry-level-drivers-want-more-mobile-mini#comment-158984) I notice all the complainers want “nothing but the best” until it’s time pay. Then they expect to spend peanuts.",
