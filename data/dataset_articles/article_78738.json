  "text": "If you’re a body ink enthusiast\nlooking for a tattoo that’s subtle but has the power to turn heads (yes, such mythical designs do exist)—white ink will do the trick. White tattoo ink gives body ink designs a certain crisp edge. You can mix it with color (advisable to only mix the same brands) or just stick with dot or line designs that exude coolness, character, and a certain edgy charm.\nThe best white tattoo ink will really make your tattoo design pop.

But, if it’s to complement a bigger or more intricate design with black or color-rich sections, you’ll be able to be more flexible with your choice of ink.\nIngredients\nAnother important thing to consider when choosing white tattoo ink is the ingredients. Check the label carefully to see whether your ink of choice contains ingredients that create a crisp color tone (like titanium oxide or zinc oxide) and that the ink’s formula is trusted.\nIf you have sensitive skin or any allergies, you should also check to see if there are any ingredients that are likely to cause you issues. That’s the last thing you want when inking your body.\nSafety\nLast but certainly not least, you should make sure that the brand, as well as the product you’re looking to use, is 100% tried, tested, and safe. Look at the brand’s track record, read reviews, and make sure everything is above board before pressing the ‘buy’ button.\nWhy you should trust us\nI only have a couple of permanent tattoos (big thanks to my niece for the\ntemporary sticker sleeve), but I love body art. I also know many body ink lovers and professional tattoo artists.\nIt doesn’t hurt that I’ve been researching and writing about all things man with FashionBeans for quite some time now. From conversations with experts, I was able to develop a tried-and-tested shortlist. I also did extensive web-based research and product comparisons to finalize my epic shortlist of the best white tattoo ink products on the market. Enjoy.\nFinal verdict\nWith the perfect price-to-quality ratio as well as a decent portion size and a wonderful tone of brilliant white,\nDYNAMIC is my undisputed top pick for best white tattoo ink. It’s used by plenty of pro tattoo artists and has a formula that offers an incredibly crisp and vibrant finish.\nBut, while DYNAMIC came out on top, every ink on my hitlist is, well…epic. So, consider your personal inking needs, work your way back through the list—and take your pick.\n-\n- What’s the best way to use white tattoo ink?\nWithout the right skills or approach, even the best tattoo ink will fail to create a head-turning masterpiece. White tattoo ink is no exception.\nWhen you’re using white tattoo ink, it’s important to have a clear-cut vision. You can use white ink to create very subtle, chunky line designs. Or you can use it on black ink to highlight certain parts of your design. It’s also possible to use white ink as shading with certain visual designs.\nWhatever you use your white ink for visually, make sure you do your prep beforehand and follow the manufacturer’s instructions down to the letter.\n- Does white tattoo ink fade?\nWhite tattoo ink does fade. It tends to fade at a similar rate as black or colored inks and, in some cases, can morph into a slightly yellowish tone over time.\nThe best way to preserve the life of your white tattoo ink is to use a good\naftercare productas well as a good tattoo soap. Oh, and don’t go for cheap inks with poor reviews or poor-quality ingredients!\n-",
