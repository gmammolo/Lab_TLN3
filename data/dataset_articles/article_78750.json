  "text": "Transform Your Data Skills Overnight: 5 Tips and Tricks Five essential How-To’s you need to master as a Data Scientist and the role of GenAI — The Surprising Impact of GenAI on Data Science Where data is akin to currency, the role of a data scientist has become increasingly important and Data science is not only a simple discipline, it regroups various disciplines. The volume, velocity, and variety of data continue to grow exponentially, and mastering a core set of skills is crucial for professionals in this field. These skills are not just technical; they also encompass the ability to adapt and evolve with emerging technologies, such as GenAI. So what are the 5 most How-Tos in Data Science? GenAI, mastering it is key to real growth as a Data Scientist. I am not talking about developing your own GenAI algorithms but using those available for you: ChatGPT, Bard, Gemini etc… Besides that, you have to understand the following concepts 100% to truly become a master. GenAI is not a distant future; it is a present reality, reshaping the fabric of data science. From data cleaning to model optimization, GenAI’s influence is pervasive. Understanding and leveraging this technology will be a distinguishing factor for data scientists seeking to excel in their field. This article aims to explore these essential skills, underscoring the growing significance of GenAI in each domain. 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation Data cleaning and preparation often considered the less glamorous yet most critical step in data science, as it lays the foundation for any analytical project. This stage involves transforming raw data into a clean, usable format. A significant portion of a data scientist’s time (60–80%) is dedicated to dealing with missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in data. Data preprocessing quality directly impacts the final analysis’s accuracy and reliability. Where data is becoming increasingly complex and voluminous, traditional data cleaning methods are evolving. Generative AI (GenAI can automate the imputation of missing values, detect and handle outliers, and even suggest…",
