  "text": "More stability is on the horizon for healthcare, which will give health systems an opportunity to innovate, transform and reclaim their culture, Greg Till, chief people officer at Renton, Wash.-based Providence Health System predicts. Mr. Till told Becker's he's expecting to see more use of technology in 2024, including analytics and automation in hiring. \"I expect to see an increased use of analytics and automation in the hiring process, and a definitive move toward accelerated development based on skills, and the adoption of technology to ease caregivers' way,\" Mr. Till said. \"For the future, systems will get even more aggressive about testing and adopting new models of care, leveraging artificial intelligence and large language models and pushing the boundaries of flexible work.\" With financial headwinds, the COVID-19 and workforce crises abating, systems have a chance to reconnect with their mission, Mr. Till said. \"Undergirding all the change and transformation will be meaningful efforts to reconnect caregivers to healthcare's mission, retooling our 'employee value proposition,' and doubling down on wellbeing efforts to bring back the joy of practice,\" Mr. Till said.
