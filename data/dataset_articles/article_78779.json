  "text": "First Episode \"Was the counter-culture an invention?\" Drops January 10th, 2024\nNew Episodes Every Wednesday at 7:00 PM Central / 8:00 PM EST\nFor More Information Visit\nhttps://consaracytheories.com/ Tulsa, OK - December 28, 2023 - Today, Sara Causey announced the launch of her new podcast series, “ co-sara-cy theories .” This riveting series is a spin-off of Causey’s popular podcast, the Causey Consulting Podcast. While the Causey Consulting Podcast focuses on general business-related issues, con-sara-cy theories promises to unravel the mysteries hidden beneath the surface. The series will focus on corruption, hidden agendas, alternative viewpoints, and ways to ferret out the truth. The podcast will release its first episode titled \"Was the counter-culture an invention?\" on January 10th, 2024. Episodes will drop every Wednesday at 7:00 p.m. CST/ 8:00 p.m. EST.\nDuring each episode of con-sara-cy theories, Causey will take listeners on a thought-provoking journey into the unknown, where forbidden knowledge is brought to light and conventional narratives are challenged. Conversations will probe the dark underbelly of the state, Corporate America, and their intricate web of domestic and international cronies.\n\"I'm excited to launch this new podcast because, as a writer and a truth seeker, it provides a space to explore lingering questions,” said Causey. “My goal is to ask questions we shouldn't and seek out information we're not supposed to know. We may not reach any firm conclusions in an hour or less, but we can make a start.”\nIn the first episode, \"Was the counter-culture an invention?\" Causey will examine the possibility that the 1960s hippie culture didn't spring up naturally - it was created intentionally.\nThrough this podcast, Causey hopes to foster a community of critical thinkers who are unafraid to explore the unconventional and challenge the status quo.\n\"The setting of my con-sara-cy theories podcast is as though we were having a discussion at happy hour after the shop closes,\" said Causey.\nListeners can subscribe to con-sara-cy theories on any major podcast provider or visit consaracytheories.com to listen to episodes and learn more about the podcast.\nFor press inquiries, interviews, or more information, please contact:\nSara Causey\nsara@causeyconsultingllc.com\nconsaracytheories.com\n con-sara-cy theories\nContact Person: Sara Causey\nEmail: Send Email\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://consaracytheories.com/",
