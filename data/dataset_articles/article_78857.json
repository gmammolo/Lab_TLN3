  "text": "Avocado image\nPerspective from Faith Seke PhD, Agronomy and Crop Science (ongoing), Master’s degree, Food Science and Technology · 1 years of experience · South Africa Benefits\nAvocados are a good source of vitamin K which is necessary for blood clotting and preventing excessive bleeding. Avocados are a good source of potassium and the amount is higher than other fruits, with a 100 gram serving containing 14% of the recommended daily allowance. Avocados are high in fiber, which can contribute to weight loss, reducing blood sugar spikes and also assisting in lowering the risk of diseases. A 100 gram serving of avocados will contain about 7 grams of fiber and 27% of the recommended daily allowance.
