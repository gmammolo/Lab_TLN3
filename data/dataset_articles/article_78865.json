  "text": "The \"mRNA: Therapeutics and Global Markets\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\nThe global market for mRNA therapeutics reached $60 billion in 2022 and is estimated to reach $21 billion by the end of 2028. It is expected to decline at the CAGR of -8.6% during the forecast period. The decline, which stems from the end of COVID-19 pandemic, should be mitigated by the introduction of new drugs during the forecast period.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created a niche market for mRNA therapeutics, particularly vaccines. Developed countries used mRNA vaccines for protection against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2. The fast-paced development of mRNA vaccines was possible due to advancement in sequencing as well as two decades of previous research on mRNA drugs. mRNA drugs should become a major segment of vaccines and therapeutics.\nThe mechanism of action of mRNA vaccine is like that elucidated by the protein-based vaccines. The mRNA particle, which is inserted into a healthy patient, carries the code for an antigen (a small piece of protein found on the virus's outer membrane). Viral proteins are produced via the mRNA code. The body recognizes it as a foreign material and produces antibodies necessary for the protection against the diseases.\nKey factors driving the mRNA global market include the increasing number of pandemics and epidemic diseases. In the past 20 years, the world has experienced the two epidemics: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); and the pandemic COVID-19. These situations highlighted the need for technologies like mRNA that are easy to produce and upscale quickly. The COVID-19 pandemic pushed mRNA therapeutics to the forefront of the pharma and bio-pharma industries.\nAnother key growth factor is the pharmaceutical industry's investment in the mRNA segment. Large pharmaceutical companies are seeking innovative drugs that have limited side effects. mRNA presents one such opportunity. Also, private investments are increasing in this segment, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHowever, the market also is facing a few challenges, such as lack of standard regulations that affect a different class of therapeutics. This leads to confusion for new and existing players for which pathway to follow. Existing and new technologies, such as protein and CRISP, respectively, also pose competition.\nThe pipeline of mRNA drugs is robust. Under favorable conditions, a drug should enter the market by late 2024 or early 2025. Currently, the majority of drugs in the pipeline target infectious diseases or are being developed as vaccines. Also, therapeutic drugs target cancer treatment. Some drugs have received fast-track status from the FDA, increasing the pace of those clinical trials due to their promising results. Drug trials using mRNA vaccines are showing efficacy in the range of 70% to 85%. There are 2 influenzas vaccines which are, under phase 3 clinical trials and will be commercialized during the forecast period.\nReport Scope\nThis report focuses on the mRNA therapeutics market and includes the types of mRNA and their application in therapy. Also, the report focuses on the patent analysis and clinical trial analysis of mRNA. The report also portrays the trends and dynamics affecting the market during the study period. The study covers market projections through 2028 and profiles major market players.\nThe Report Includes\n37 data tables and 27 additional tables An overview of the global market related to mRNA therapeutics In-depth analysis of global market trends, featuring historical revenue data for 2021 and 2022, estimated figures for 2023, forecasts for 2028, and projections of compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) through 2028 Evaluation of the current market and revenue growth prospects specific to mRNA therapeutics, accompanied by a market share analysis by therapeutic type and geographical region Coverage of the pandemic threats, therapeutic developments, and new technologies in the market Discussion of the advantages of mRNA over protein and DNA-based delivery systems, demographic and economic trends, and outlook for the mRNA therapeutics market Information on prophylactic vaccines, vaccine discovery and development, and R&D activities Analysis of the various therapeutics as well as promising vaccines intended for the prevention and treatment of chronic and infectious diseases Assessment of regulatory structure, pricing and reimbursement scenarios, the pipeline for new molecules and therapeutics Market share analysis of the key companies and mergers & acquisitions, joint ventures, collaborations, and partnerships Profiles of leading market participants Key Topics Covered:\nChapter 1 Introduction\nChapter 2 Summary and Highlights\nChapter 3 Market Overview\nEvolution of RNA Therapeutics History of RNA Therapeutics Development of RNA Therapeutics and Types DNA Therapeutics vs. RNA Therapeutics Clinical Need for RNA Therapeutics Increasing Disease Population and Economic Burden Limitations of Traditional Therapeutics Therapeutic Limitations of Biologics Poor Management of Chronic Diseases Limited Treatment for Rare Diseases RNA Therapeutics Antisense Oligonucleotide (ASO) as Therapeutics Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) as Therapeutics miRNA as Therapeutics Aptamers as Therapeutics mRNA as Therapeutics Manufacturing RNA-Based Biopharmaceuticals Chromatographic Purification Steps Delivery of RNA Therapeutics Polymer Conjugation/Chemical Modification Encapsulation Lipid-Based Nanoparticles Polymer Nanomaterials Silica Nanoparticles Carbon and Gold Nanomaterials GalNAc Institution and Hospital-Based RNA Therapeutics Regulatory Influence on the Market for RNA Therapeutics Impact of COVID-19 Chapter 4 Market Dynamics\nChapter 5 Target Disease and Disorders\nChapter 6 Pipeline and Clinical Trial Analysis\nChapter 7 Market Breakdown by Product\nChapter 8 Market Breakdown by Region\nChapter 9 Emerging Technologies and Developments\nNanoparticles Modified mRNA Automated mRNA Synthesis Kits Bio Platforms Chapter 10 Patent Analysis\nChapter 11 Outlook for Mergers & Acquisitions, and Venture Funding\nChapter 12 Competitive Intelligence\nChapter 13 Company Profiles\nArctur U.S. Therapeutics Biontech Curevac Gennova Biopharmaceuticals Merck Moderna Nutcracker Therapeutics Omega Therapeutics Strand Therapeutics Vaxess Technologies For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/8ed6om\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.
