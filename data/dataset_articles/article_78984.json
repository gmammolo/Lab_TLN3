  "text": "The cinematic landscape of 2023 witnessed a renaissance in animation, solidifying its place as one of the greatest years for the medium. The ubiquity of animated features, spearheaded by notable releases, contributed to the industry's success. Notably, if not for the phenomenon that is “Barbie,” the chart-topping movie of the year would undoubtedly have been “The Super Mario Bros. Movie.” Let's not even get started on [Spider-Man](https://clutchpoints.com/metro-boomin-puts-aside-upcoming-album) (don't worry, we will later), but Sony is finally doing something right with a Marvel character. Across the Spider-Verse inspired, [hired a teenage artist to do the LEGO scene](https://ew.com/movies/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-lego-scene-animated-by-14-year-old/), and left us all with one of the greatest cliffhangers audiences have seen in recent years, EW reports. However, it's not just the sheer quantity of animated films that defined the greatness of 2023; it's the originality within larger franchises, coupled with a diverse array of animation styles—from stop-motion to computer animation and traditional animation—that brought these creations to life. Previous years set a high bar with masterpieces like Klaus, Wolfwalkers, and Puss In Boots: The Last Wish. Although 2023 presented a more eclectic and uneven collection of films, it continued the trend of delivering spectacular animated offerings. Each film, regardless of scale, found its place, showcasing the beauty of animation as a medium. Without further ado, let's delve into the standout animated features of 2023: ‘Elemental': Pixar's Heartfelt Marvel Pixar's latest offering, “Elemental,” emerged as a testament to the studio's storytelling prowess. Set in a modern metropolis where characters based on the elements coexist, the film revolves around the romance between Ember, a fiery character voiced by Leah Lewis, and Wade, a water-based character played by Mamoudou Athie. Directed by Peter Sohn, the film not only captivates with its gorgeously rendered technological marvel but also serves as a deeply moving ode to the immigrant experience in America. Sohn's autobiographical details, woven into the narrative, make “Elemental” undeniably Pixar-y. ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie': Nostalgic Faithfulness Breaking box-office records, “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” stood out for its faithful adaptation of the beloved video game characters. While Chris Pratt's casting as Mario raised eyebrows, the film's commitment to delivering what fans wanted paid off. The vibrant animation by Illumination brought Mario's world to life, with the narrative focusing on rescuing Luigi from the clutches of Bowser. Despite initial skepticism, the movie's success lies in its nostalgic delight and commitment to staying true to the source material. ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem': A Teenage Renaissance Director Jeff Rowe breathed new life into the “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” franchise with “Mutant Mayhem.” Setting it apart from previous iterations, Rowe hired actual teenagers to voice the characters, embracing the teenage essence of the title. The film's visual style, resembling doodles from a teenager's school notebook, and the jangly score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross contributed to its charm. “Mutant Mayhem” not only dazzled with its animation but also became one of the most emotionally involving entries in the TMNT legacy. ‘The Boy and The Heron': Miyazaki's Dreamlike Odyssey Hayao Miyazaki returned with “The Boy and The Heron,” a dreamlike tale that unfolded with visual splendor and subtle storytelling. Exploring themes of loss, family, and the mystical, the film showcased Miyazaki's mastery. The non-traditional story structure, coupled with breathtaking visuals, created an enchanting narrative. Robert Pattinson's near-unrecognizable voice acting added to the film's allure, marking a powerful and thought-provoking addition to Miyazaki's illustrious filmography. ‘Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse': Sequel Triumph The sequel to “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” exceeded expectations with groundbreaking animation and an emotionally charged storyline. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” continued Miles Morales' journey as he encountered more Spider-people and grappled with the burdens of being a hero. Directors Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson, along with writers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, crafted a sequel that raised the bar for storytelling and animation in the superhero genre. The detailed and eye-popping parallel worlds, coupled with a melancholic tone, left audiences enthralled. While many can argue it wasn't the best-animated movie of 2023, their points might not hold much weight to many who disagree with that stance. In summary, 2023 showcased the versatility and brilliance of animated cinema. From the heartfelt narratives of Pixar to the nostalgic adventures of Mario and the revitalization of iconic franchises like TMNT, each film left an indelible mark on the year, reaffirming animation's power to captivate audiences of all ages. As we look ahead, the legacy of these animated masterpieces will undoubtedly continue to influence and inspire future generations of storytellers.",
