  "text": "Vesperia returns! It's time to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Tales of Vesperia with an improved version of the popular Anime RPG with the Tales of Vesperia\\u00a0 Definitive Edition! Players will witness the power struggle between the citizens of Terca Lumireis, who are dependent on an ancient technology - the blastia - and the Empire that controls it. Join the fight and follow the story of two friends whose paths intertwine in an epic adventure that threatens the existence of all. UNIQUE BATTLE SYSTEM Engage in exciting close-quarter combat using the series' trademarked Evolved Flex-Range Linear Motion Battle System. Gain an advantage in battle by using the right attack and approaching enemies while they're unaware of your presence - and chain together combo attacks with the aim of activating your character's Fatal Strike move. DEFINITIVE EXPERIENCE Witness updated, upscaled full HD graphics, brand-new music tracks, exciting mini-games, boss fights, and a collection of unreleased costume DLC - Tales of Vesperia has never looked so good! NEW CHARACTERS The roster has expanded with the Definitive Edition as players can now control two additional playable characters. Play as Patty Fleur - a tough young pirate girl in search of treasure, adventure and her forgotten memories - and Flynn Scifo, an Imperial Knight and Yuri\\u2019s best friend.",
