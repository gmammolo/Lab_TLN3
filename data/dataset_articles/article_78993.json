  "text": "2023-12-28 20:24:00\nAccording to the scientific journal IScience, the embryo belongs to a group of feathered theropods called oviraptorosaurs and measures about 27 centimeters long and offers a fascinating insight into the evolutionary links between dinosaurs and modern birds.\nNicknamed “Baby Yingliang,” this dinosaur embryo is one of the most complete ever discovered, providing researchers with a rare opportunity to observe a baby theropod in an unusual posture, similar to that of today’s bird embryos shortly before the hatching. The posture, called “tucking,” involves hunching the body and lowering the head under the wing, a vital behavior for modern birds during hatching.\nBelgian researchers identify the true cause of the extinction of dinosaurs: “One element played a dominant role”\nThe scientists, including independent writer Ben Taub, published their findings in a paper in 2021, pointing out that the posture observed in Baby Yingliang is unprecedented in non-avian dinosaurs but reminiscent of that of contemporary bird embryos. This similarity suggests that folding behavior may have evolved among the theropod ancestors of birds.\nProfessor Steve Brusatte, author of the study, commented on this exceptional discovery by pointing out that the prenatal dinosaur resembles a baby bird rolled up in its egg. This observation reinforces the idea that many characteristics of modern birds evolved from their dinosaur ancestors.\nAlthough this discovery is extraordinary, the researchers note that it is currently the only specimen of its type. Therefore, in-depth studies on other similar fossils will be necessary to confirm the hypotheses formulated from Baby Yingliang. Nonetheless, preliminary findings suggest that some developmental behaviors considered exclusively avian may be more deeply rooted in the theropod lineage. A breakthrough that sheds new light on the fascinating evolution of feathered and toothless species that populated the Earth millions of years ago.\n1703804739\n#Exceptional #discovery #perfectly #preserved #dinosaur #embryo #fossilized #egg",
