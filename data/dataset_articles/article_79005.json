  "text": "Hollywood icon Sir Michael Caine is reportedly coming out of retirement to take part in a new Netflix series.\nThe A Bridge Too Far actor, 90, devastated fans when he announced his retirement from acting in October. The British legend has been in more than 160 films over a career spanning seven decades. At the time, Sir Michael told the BBC : \"You don't have leading men at 90.\"\n\"I keep saying I’m going to retire. Well, I am now. I’ve figured, I’ve had a picture where I’ve played the lead and had incredible reviews… What am I going to do that will beat this?\" And now, a few months after his announcement, it has been revealed he was asked to take part in one final series.\nThe Oscar, Golden Globe and Bafta-winning actor has an extensive and diverse filmography, including classic films ranging from Zulu and The Italian Job to more recently in Interstellar and The Dark Knight franchise, alongside Christian Bale. His final film was The Great Escaper with the late Glenda Jackson.\nSpeaking about the upcoming series, an insider claimed to The Sun : \"He’s been asked to star in a Netflix series. Details are kept closely guarded.\" Filming reportedly starts next month. The Mirror have contacted his reps for comment.\nSir Michael's final film, The Great Escaper was released on October 6 and has him playing real-life World War Two veteran Bernie Jordan who escaped from a care home to attend D-Day celebrations in France. Sir Michael had turned the film down three times before accepting the role as he considered himself retired.\nHe stars alongside Glenda, who died in June after the completion of the film. Announcing his retirement, he also told BBC Radio 4's Today show: \"The only parts I’m liable to get now are 90-year-old men. Or maybe 85. They’re not going to be the lead. You don’t have leading men at 90, you’re going to have young handsome boys and girls. So I thought, I might as well leave with all this.”\nHis announcement comes a month before Sir Michael’s novel Deadly Game is scheduled for release. The novel follows the adventures of DCI Harry Taylor, a detective with no respect for red tape or political reputations.\nSir Michael said in June: “It’s been my ambition for years to write a thriller. It’s the genre I most love to read and I’ve really got a buzz out of working on Deadly Game and teaming up with Hodder once again to publish it. I hope readers enjoy getting to know Harry Taylor as much as I did.”\nFollow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",
