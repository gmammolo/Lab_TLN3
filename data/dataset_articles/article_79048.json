He said Basirih landfill produces a lot of methane gas can be utilized for cooking and other purposes. The city government has built network infrastructure to supply residents' homes so it is not wasted. \"The plan is 60 residents houses around the Basirih landfill will be contributed by methane gas complete with stove,\" said Ibnu Sina. In last February, the Environment and Forestry Ministry official Rosa Vivien Ratnawati said that the ministry is aiming to put the methane gas generated by all waste landfills to use by 2050. At a “Climate Corner” discussion in Jakarta on Wednesday (Feb 22, 2023) she said that methane gas from landfills will be utilized in order to reduce carbon emissions produced by waste, especially organic waste. \"If waste can be managed well, then it will contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions,\" she said. According to the ministry's National Waste Management Information System (SISPN), Indonesia has 531 landfills spread out from Aceh to Papua.

The reason is, Ibnu Sina admitted, the landfill is already holding so much waste, causing the land area to become increasingly narrow. Measures are needed to minimize waste disposal at the Basirih final waste disposal, one of which is to encourage residents to sort waste from home. \"Indeed it is effective to sort waste from home, before being thrown into a temporary garbage site or to the landfill,\" he said. The city government also continues to promote the construction of integrated waste management site (TPST) or the waste management processing site of reduce, reuse, and recycle (TPS-3R). In addition, Banjarmasin also continues to promote waste banks in residential areas. Now there are more than 300 units of waste bank available.
