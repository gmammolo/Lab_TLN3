  "text": "From the stunning images beamed to Earth from the remarkable Webb Space Telescope to further advancement in spaceflight pioneered by public and private entities, 2023 was an exciting year in our exploration of the heavens.\nThat progress is expected to continue in 2024, highlighted by a manned mission to the moon among other promising efforts. The commonwealth will be a featured player in that effort, and its important that Virginia officials continue to support spaceflight operations and the potential economic boom they represent.\nGo outside on a clear winter’s night, away from the shine of city lights, and it’s easy to be thrilled and awestruck by the majesty of the heavens. The inky black of space is filled with the unknown, and it’s little wonder that mankind set off to explore it when it developed the means to do so.\nThis year, images captured by the Webb telescope, a technological marvel, brought those faraway celestial bodies closer than ever, with each new photo revealing something inspiring and wonderful. Already scientists have collected reams of data that they believe will help them learn more about the universe.\nThis year also saw NASA achieve a number of important milestones toward the larger goal of returning humans to the moon for the first time since December 1972 and ultimately traveling to Mars.\nAstronaut Frank Rubio completed a full year in space aboard the International Space Station, which this month marked 25 years of continuous flight . NASA also successfully used its Deep Space Optical Communications program to transmit data encoded on a laser over 10 million miles.\nThe Artemis program, which will take humans back to the moon in 2024 and eventually to Mars, depends on astronauts being comfortable living and working for long stretches of time in space, developing reliable communications systems and a host of other practical issues related to sustained spaceflight.\nDeveloping those systems and successfully returning to the moon will demand plenty from everyone connected to the program. And Hampton Roads can be proud of the essential contributions of NASA Langley in Hampton , where workers are tackling issues related to astronaut safety, launch systems and the safe return of the Orion spacecraft.\nThere will be ample focus on NASA Langley in the coming year and the Artemis mission draws closer, but that’s not our region’s only space-related effort. The Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island continues to grow its profile as it looks ahead to an exciting 2024.\nThis month, the Commonwealth Transportation Board appropriated $20 million to expand one of three launch pads at the facility to accommodate larger rockets. According to reporting by the Virginia Mercury, the funding follows an announcement by Northram Grumman that it will develop new rockets with Firefly Aerospace, which will allow it to resupply the International Space Station in the coming years.\nThere’s also the prospect of commercial spaceflight from Wallops Island, which board members discussed at their December meeting. While that may still be a distant opportunity, it is one worth pursuing as more private companies look to open the heavens to (well-heeled) tourism.\nAll of that benefits the commonwealth’s bottom line. Maj. Gen. Ted Mercer, CEO and executive director of the Virginia Spaceport Authority, told the Mercury that “for every dollar Virginia has invested into the spaceport, the commonwealth receives nearly $3 back in economic return.”\nBeyond that bottom line, though, is the fact that so much work on space has additional benefits, such as in science education for area schools and colleges, or the careers that result from our investment in space flight.\nThe space sector is rapidly expanding and Virginia — with NASA Langley, Wallops Island and a growing roster of private aerospace companies — is poised to seize that opportunity. Humans have always been enthralled by the mystery and majesty of the heavens. It’s thrilling to see the commonwealth play a leading role in the next stage of space exploration and travel.\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window)",
