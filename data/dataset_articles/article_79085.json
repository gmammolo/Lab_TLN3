  "text": "Former Finnish PM Sanna Marin Reflects on Leadership and Tech at Slush Conference\nIn a recent conversation at the Slush tech conference in Helsinki, Sanna Marin, Finland’s ex-prime minister, shared her insights on a range of pressing global issues. Marin, known for her youthful leadership and pushing Finland towards NATO membership in light of Russian aggression, discussed her post-political career pursuits, including her role as a strategy advisor at the Tony Blair Institute and her involvement in a new startup.\nDuring the conference, Marin conveyed her thoughts on the global ramifications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the need for countries to be less naive about authoritarian regimes. Her experience leading a nation bordering Russia provided her with an acute perspective on the urgency of geopolitical awareness and action, a stance she maintains following her departure from Finnish politics.\nMarin underscored the importance of self-trust—particularly for women aiming for leadership roles—in overcoming self-doubt to achieve their ambitions. She emphasized this point to a largely tech-oriented audience, suggesting that the industry could benefit greatly from more diverse leadership.\nFurthermore, Marin discussed Finland’s commitment to increase R&D spending to address future challenges such as climate change and pandemics. The strategic investment in technology and innovation demonstrates Finland’s proactive approach to global and national issues.\nThe conversation concluded with an optimistic outlook on Europe’s role in establishing robust tech regulations and international collaboration, which has been fortified by the events unfolding in Ukraine.\n*Summary*: At Slush tech conference, Sanna Marin, Finland’s former Prime Minister and a pioneer in NATO negotiations, shared her viewpoints on global politics and technology’s role in facing future challenges.
