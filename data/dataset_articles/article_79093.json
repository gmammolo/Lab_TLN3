  "text": "Technology has led to the invention of a lot of kitchen equipment that has made our lives a lot easier. Things like refrigerators, rice, cookers, air, fryers, and microwaves have made so much of a difference in our lives. Because of their easy use and time-saving techniques, all of these appliances have become an instant hit in the market. A microwave is one of the most important parts of a kitchen. It is used for multiple purposes like baking, toasting, heating, and grilling. If you are planning to buy a new microwave for your kitchen, then there are some important factors that you must consider before making this important purchase.\n* Power Consumption\nThe power consumption of a microwave depends on the brand and the variety that you are choosing. If you are planning to buy a microwave for bulk cooking and more frequent use, then you must go for a microwave with higher voltage. On the other hand, if your usage of the microwave is going to be sporadic, then it is perfect for you to buy a microwave with a lower power consumption or voltage. You can do a simple 5-minute research on Google and shortlist the varieties that cater to your needs.\n* Size\nThe size of a microwave is also important to consider before making a purchase. If a lot of cooking in your kitchen heavily relies on the usage of a microwave then it is better to go for a larger microwave than usual. Also, if you have a large family and you generally cook in bulk, then having a large microwave is a must. On the other hand, if your family consists of only 2 to 3 people, then you can easily manage with a 3 to 4 L, small microwave. Buying a large microwave for a small family doesn't make any sense as you will never be able to use that microwave to its fullest capacity. On the other hand, having a small microwave for a large family may create problems as you won't be able to cook everything on time.\nImage Credits- Pexels\n* Child Safety Lock\nThe child safety lock is another critical feature that is often ignored while buying a microwave. Most of us have children at home and this is a feature that prevents electrical accidents in the microwave in case somebody touches it without knowing how to use it. Even if you do not have children at home, it is always better to go for a microwave that has a child safety lock system to ensure extra safety and avoid any unwanted mishappenings.\n* Automatic Sensor\nYou should always pay a lot of attention towards automatic sensors while buying a microwave. Microwaves that have an inbuilt automatic sensor switch off instantly after the food is completely cooked or heated. This prevents the food from being burnt if you're not around and have forgotten to turn the microwave off. The chances of forgetting to switch off the microwave at the right time are possible once in a while. Also, this feature helps in keeping your food hot, even if you take it out after some time. This will also prevent any accidents.\nImage Credits- Unsplash\n* Types Of Microwave\nA lot of you might not know but there are three major kinds of microwaves that you can find in the market. Each of these are different from each other in terms of the facilities and their functions. Let's have a look at these microwaves for you to have a better understanding of what you want.\n* Solo Microwave\nThis microwave is quite simple and has generic features that you would expect from a microwave. It is used for basic purposes like heating and defrosting the food that has already been cooked and stored in the refrigerator. This is the most inexpensive microwave out of the three categories as all the functions are pretty basic.\n* Grill Microwave\nThis microwave has all the simple and small features of your regular microwave and also has additional grill features. The price of this microwave is slightly higher than your solo microwave. It can be used for a variety of purposes like grilling, roasting, and also cooking foods like kebabs, pasta, rice and popcorn. It can also perform basic functions like eating and defrosting.\nVideo Credits- YouTube\n* Convection Microwave\nThis microwave has a heating element as well as a fan that both work together to spread air uniformly inside the microwave. This type of microwave is best for baking as well as grilling. It can also perform all the other functions of a basic microwave very well. This is the most expensive category of microwave that you will find in the market because of its multiple uses.\nAll of these factors are extremely important when deciding to buy yourself a microwave. Make sure that you do proper research before buying your microwave and choose what is the best for you.",
