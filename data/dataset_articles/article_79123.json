Edwin Nieves, 837th Training Squadron, tilts a door panel, as Intendente Alexander Pacheco, 837th Training Squadron, assists with assembling the shoot house at the Inter-American Air Forces Academy at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas, Jan. 10, 2023. The shoot house is among the newest equipment at the academy that will be used to train international military students from partner nations.
