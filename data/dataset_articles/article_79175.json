  "text": "In 1964, the\nlegendary Seiko released its first-ever wristwatch with a stopwatch function, the Crown Chronograph, kicking off a long and influential run of iconic chronographs, and marking the first Japanese watch to have the function. Back in 2021, Seiko announced the Style60’s series focused on paying homage to classic timepieces from its catalog, using the ‘64 Crown Chronograph as inspiration. To celebrate the original Crown Chronograph’s 60th anniversary, Seiko is expanding the Style60’s lineup with the SRPK61, a recreation of the seminal timepiece that uses the ‘64 model as a base, with a handful of modern design choices to keep things fresh.\nGetting into the specs, this recreation honors the OG design but features a few changes, like the slimmer 39.5mm stainless steel case. The boxy Hardlex crystal is taken from the original watch, along with the five rows of links in the bracelet, and it’s all powered by a 4R35 automatic movement, giving you around 41 hours of power reserve. Last but certainly not least, this reissue comes with a date window on the dial, something the original\nCrown Chronograph didn’t have.\nTo celebrate this special release, “Limited Edition” is inscribed on the elegant see-through case back, coupled with a serial number to denote the model, and the watch comes inside a vintage box that’s designed to capture the essence of the era. As for the changes made in this reissue, some may not like the slimmer profile and the addition of a date window (or the lack of a pusher), but the Style60’s series hinges on homage rather than direct recreations, while incorporating more modern design choices.\nThe Seiko Presage Style60’s SRPK61 will be available for $595 starting January 2024, but it’s limited to 5,000 pieces, so you’ll want to act fast if you’re interested.",
