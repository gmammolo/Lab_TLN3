  "text": "RisingWings, a creative studio of KRAFTON, Inc., released its January update for the popular real-time PvP tower defense mobile game, Defense Derby .\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231228541981/en/\nDefense Derby reveals the Blacksmith unit on the January update (Graphic: KRAFTON, Inc.)\nThis update brings in the Blacksmith, a new physical-type human faction unit. Her unique ability, Forge, enhances the hero's attack power and speed. As a splash damage unit, the Blacksmith excels against groups of monsters and provides valuable support to heroes. Players can acquire the Blacksmith via the Shop of Blessings, Lucky Draw, Featured Summon, and Step Up Pack. The Derby Brawl - Blacksmith Mirror Match, featuring this new unit, is available until January 11.\nJanuary also marks the release of a new hero and the Radiant Start season. Lana, a magic-type hero from the human faction, has been introduced as the final hero to commemorate the 100-day anniversary of Defense Derby . Lana's abilities include summoning a damage-absorbing shield at a battle's start and the Divine Judgement skill, which targets the monster with the highest max HP. If the targeted monster is defeated, her skill's cooldown decreases. Lana will be granted as a legendary card to all players as of January 1.\nStarting January 15, players can anticipate the debut of Electric Monk, a magic-type beast faction unit. Electric Monk's special ability, Electric Blast, creates a magnetic field on critical hits, affecting the surrounding area. The Derby Brawl - Electric Monk Mirror Match, available from January 15 to January 28, will showcase this new unit.\nIn the spirit of the winter season, a Christmas event is also available. Players can complete the missions to get all the puzzle pieces, then claim the final rewards of the puzzle such as the Christmas Castle Skin, Rare Unit Summon, and Crystals. The Christmas event will run until December 31.\nFor the latest Defense Derby updates, please visit https://www.facebook.com/DefenseDerby.THAILAND and follow along on social media (YouTube | Discord).\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231228541981/en/\nKRAFTON\nJihyun Park\njihyun.park@krafton.com",
