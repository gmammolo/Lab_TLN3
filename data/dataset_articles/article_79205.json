  "text": "A mum-of-two is one step closer to being Australia's first female astronaut.\n[Australian Space Agency](/story/8449301/) employee Katherine Bennell-Pegg announced she was halfway through her year-long training at the European Astronaut Centre in Germany.\nWhile other Australian women have trained to go to space, they've always done so under the flags of other countries.\nMs Bennell-Beg and her family relocated to Europe for the intensive training process.\nMore than 22,000 people applied to the coveted position in hopes of becoming an astronaut candidate.\nThe job requires rigorous physical training, as well as a year of intensive study.\n\"I have always dreamed of being an astronaut,\" she said.\n\"When I was young, it was for the adventure but after more than a decade working in space it's now because I know the role it plays in tackling real-world problems.\"\nThe next six months are expected to include intense exercise, sea survival, studying space station robotic arm simulations and centrifuge training.\n\"We need to know the basics around medical procedures - not just in case something goes wrong, but because astronauts are basically medical guinea pigs,\" she told the\n[ Australian Space Agency](/story/8338233/).\n\"In space, as your body adapts to weightlessness any medical issues you may have on Earth - such as osteoporosis, or muscle degradation - are put on fast forward and we can support research on that.\"\nThe Adelaide-born astronaut candidate previously served as Director of Space Technology at the Australian Space Agency, and as part of the space robotics and automation team.\nIn early December, Ms Bennell-Pegg travelled to the United States where she underwent specialised training with NASA in Houston and met with Australian Ambassador to the United States Kevin Rudd in Washington DC.\n\"I'm excited - not just for me - but for what my training and experience can unlock for Australian scientists, engineers and operators, and all the value that can bring,\" she said.\n ",
