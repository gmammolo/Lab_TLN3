  "text": "Purple vegetables and ‘climate-changing foods’ such as figs and almonds will be among the top gardening trends for 2024. Houseplants and wildflowers are also likely to be in vogue, according to the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) in London. The charity’s predictions for the year ahead are based on current trends and consultations with its advisers and experts. Purple foods are very popular among the health-conscious because they contain anthocyanins, antioxidants that reduce inflammation in the body. Some studies suggest that they can reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems and improve thinking skills in older people. Purple foods are very popular among health-conscious people because they contain anthocyanins that reduce inflammation. In the photo, piles of purple sweet potatoes at the vegetable market. Now people are looking beyond superfood fruits, such as blueberries, to purple vegetables, and there are new varieties that are easier to grow and avoid previous problems such as lack of fruit and limited “purple color”, especially after of cooking. Predicting that purple vegetables will be a gardening fad for next year, the RHS says: “Gardeners and chefs can look forward to purple carrots, cauliflower, broccoli, tomatoes, peas, radishes, green beans and lettuce.” Britain’s recent hot, dry summers are ideal for vines, figs, almonds, apricots, melons and watermelons, and peaches or nectarines, according to gardening experts. But they warn that climate change may make it difficult for growing fruits that need refrigeration during winter, such as blackcurrants, apples and pears. However, many of the UK’s 30 million gardeners will focus on making gardens resilient to unusual weather conditions and improving plant health in 2024, the RHS predicts. Some people are adopting “survival gardens,” such as those that use seed varieties adapted to local climates. Based on the highest number of queries the RHS has received in 2023 (115,000), it also says there has been an increase in urban gardeners, often without a garden of their own, growing plants in pots, on balconies and indoors, for example. example using terrariums. Houseplants and wildflowers are likely to become increasingly fashionable as people have less outdoor space for gardening. Enthusiasts want to fill every corner of their homes with tropical-looking plants and orchids that create a “jungle” look, and their favorite houseplants, such as the succulent known as “donkey’s tail”, Epipremnum and old favorites such as the decorative thread of hearts. plant and spider plant. Creating a Mediterranean look by growing citrus plants is increasingly popular, and inquiries to the RHS about it have increased by 22 per cent. Clare Matterson, RHS chief executive, said: “I am excited to see growing interest in gardening in urban areas. ‘My first garden was in a small flat in Brixton, London. Through this small space, I was able to put my hands in the dirt, connect with the seasons, and enjoy growing flowers and vegetables. “At RHS we want to open up gardening to everyone, everywhere.” The RHS Gardening Advice service and website continues to see notable growth in ‘grow your own’ enquiries, with gardeners happy to accept lower yields to look after their plots in a more environmentally friendly way, with less irrigation, use of mulch to retain rainwater, storage of rainwater and abandonment of fertilizers. The most popular produce grown at home is tomatoes, followed by cucumbers, zucchini, chili peppers and green beans. There is also interest in backyard fruit varieties such as dwarf raspberries, blackberries and blackberries. Meanwhile, people continue to embrace wildflowers, from non-native meadows in gardens to wildflower borders with plants such as alexander, meadowsweet and Welsh poppy. Even plants traditionally seen as “unwanted weeds,” such as robert weed and plantain, are becoming popular; Parsley is now a desirable border plant and dandelions are recognized as key to providing food for bees in early spring. Gardeners appear increasingly in tune with nature, with inquiries to the RHS on wildlife-friendly gardening increasing by more than 28 per cent in 2023, and many people choosing to let their grass grow long to support pollinating insects. , invertebrates and the wildlife that depend on it. them. There is interest in building insect hotels, sourcing pollinator-friendly plants, leaving dead wood in the garden and introducing even small aquatic features to benefit wildlife. In 2024, when the peat compost ban for hobby gardeners comes into force, people will make the most of home composting opportunities and look for sustainable alternatives. The 20 Costliest Climate Disasters of 2023 – REVEALED In 2023, no corner of the world was spared from disastrous climate phenomena that suffered droughts, floods, forest fires and tropical storms. A new report reveals the 20 most financially costly climate disasters of the year, and all six of the world’s populated continents are on the list. At the top are the shocking Hawaii wildfires in August, which killed at least 100 people and cost more than $4,000 per person in damage. Also included are the storms in Guam in May – which cost almost $1,500 per inhabitant –, the floods in New Zealand, the droughts in Spain and the forest fires in Chile. Read more",
