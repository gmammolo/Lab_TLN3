  "text": "JAKARTA – NASA’s Valkyrie human robot, 6 feet 2 inches (188 centimeters) tall and weighing 300 pounds (136 kilograms), is an impressive figure. The Valkyrie, named after a female figure in Norse mythology and being tested at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, is designed to operate in “damaged or degraded man-made environments,” such as areas affected by natural disasters. However, such robots could also one day operate in outer space. A humanoid robot resembles a human, generally with a body, head, two arms, and two legs. Engineers believe that with the right software, human robots will eventually be able to function similarly to humans and use the same tools and equipment. NASA’s Skilled Robotics Team Leader, Shaun Azimi, said that human robots in space could eventually handle risky tasks such as cleaning solar panels or checking problematic equipment outside spacecraft so astronauts can prioritize exploration and discovery. “We’re not trying to replace human crew, we’re really just trying to take the boring, dirty and dangerous work out of their jobs to allow them to focus on higher level activities,” Azimi said. NASA is working with robotics companies like Austin, Texas-based Apptronik to understand how human robots developed for purposes on Earth could benefit future human robots destined for space. Apptronik developed Apollo, a humanoid robot whose duties on Earth included working in warehouses and manufacturing plants moving packages, stacking pallets and other supply chain related tasks. The company plans to start providing these human robots to companies in early 2025. Apptronik CTO Nick Paine said that Apollo has clear advantages over its human counterpart, especially durability.

Apptronik CEO Jeff Cardenas said the sky is the limit as software and development advances enhance Apollo’s capabilities. “The approach is that we start in the warehouse and on the factory floor, but then can move into retail… to shipping and more into what we call the structureless space,” Cardenas said. According to Azimi, in the coming years, this structureless space could include outer space. “Robots like Apollo are designed with modularity in mind to be able to adapt to many applications,” Azimi said. “And that’s where NASA is really trying to get those insights – to see what the key gaps are, where we need to invest in the future to get systems on Earth into the space environment and certified to operate there.” Tag: space nasa valkyrie robot 2023-12-28 21:05:00 #Valkyrie #NASAs #Human #Robot #Operating #Risky #Tasks #Space",
