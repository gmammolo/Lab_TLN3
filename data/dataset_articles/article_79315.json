Epub 2023 Dec 3. PMID:\n38144358\nGuo Liu\nAlleviating inflammation and promoting dentine regeneration is critical for the healing of pulpitis. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory, angiogenesis and odontogenesis function of icariin on Human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) under inflammatory state. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms was also evaluated. Icariin attenuated the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory marker expression, such as interleukin-1β(IL-1β), IL-6 and IL-8. The immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining results showed that icariin suppressed the inflammatory responses mediated by the protein kinase B (Akt) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling cascades. Additionally, icariin also upregulated the expression of odontogenic and angiogenic genes and proteins (namely dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), anti-collagenⅠ(COL-Ⅰ), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1)), alkaline phosphatase activity, and calcium nodule deposition in LPS-exposed HDPCs. In a word, our findings indicated that icariin attenuated pulp inflammation and promoted odontogenic and angiogenic differentiation in the inflammatory state. Icariin may be a promising vital pulp therapy agent for the regenerative treatment of the inflamed dental pulp.\n[Icariin : CK(10) : AC(7)](/substance/icariin) [Inflammation : CK(9572) : AC(3089)](/disease/inflammation), [Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Toxicity : CK(1764) : AC(1073)](/disease/lipopolysaccharide-induced-toxicity)",
