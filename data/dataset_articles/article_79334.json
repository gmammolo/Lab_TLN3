  "title": "Xiaomi 14, 14 Pro and Watch S3 Get Two New Colors To Celebrate SU7 Launch",
  "text": "Earlier today, [Xiaomi](https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Xiaomi) introduced the Xiaomi SU7, its very first electric car at an event in China. At the end of the [event](https://www.gizchina.com/2023/12/28/xiaomi-electric-car-xiaomi-su7/), to celebrate the launch, the company introduced its Xiaomi 14, 14 Pro, and Watch S3 devices in Limited Edition Aqua Blue, and Verdant Green colors, matching the colors of the new car. The new color options will join the existing Jade Green, Black, White, and Snow Mountain Pink colors. They use a black high-gloss metal middle frame + a glass back panel of the same color as the car. Through this [article](https://www.fonearena.com/blog/413086/xiaomi-14-xiaomi-14-pro-and-watch-s3-get-blue-and-green-limited-edition-versions.html), we will talk about the two new colors. New Exclusive Colors for the Xiaomi 14 series and the Watch S3 When it comes to the Xiaomi Watch S3, the new color options will join the Black, Silver, and Brown Leather colorways. Interestingly, the new colors come with a “Limited Edition” text on the casing around the display. The watch looks stunning in these new color options. Gizchina News of the week When it comes to the price there are no surprises for the Xiaomi 14 or 14 Pro. The limited edition custom color versions will cost the same as the original version. The price will start at CNY 4,999 ($707) for the Xiaomi 14. The Xiaomi 14 Pro in these limited colors will start at CNY 5,999 ($849). When it comes to the Xiaomi Watch S3, it is CNY 100 more expensive than the original eSIM version. It will cost CNY 1,099 ($155). The specifications of these devices will remain the same regardless of the new color options. Unfortunately, they are limited to the Chinese market as the Xiaomi SU7 also is. The whole “Limited Edition” term probably means that these units will be sold in a small quantity and will be limited to that particular market. So, we don’t have many hopes of seeing them outside of China. Despite this, it’s interesting to see Xiaomi trying to pair its products with the newest electric vehicle. The SU7 probably is one of the most advanced and costlier products released by Xiaomi, so the company is trying to bring all the attention to it.
