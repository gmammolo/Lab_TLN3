  "text": "It is the time of year when families spending days together at home often start a challenging new jigsaw puzzle. But many fall at the first hurdle by failing to have the right-sized surface for all the pieces. Now that problem has been solved by a research paper revealing that the best table size is just under twice the size of the assembled puzzle. Data scientist Dr Madeleine Bonsma-Fisher and her quantum physicist husband Dr Kent Bonsma-Fisher concluded this after completing nine jigsaws, with the number of pieces ranging from nine to 2,000. They found an unassembled jigsaw puzzle takes up an area about 1.7 times its finished size. A research paper has revealed that the best table size to do a puzzle on is just under twice the size of the assembled puzzle (Stock image) Data scientist Dr Madeleine Bonsma-Fisher and her quantum physicist husband Dr Kent Bonsma-Fisher concluded this after completing nine jigsaws, with the number of pieces ranging from nine to 2,000 (Stock image) The researchers laid out and measured the pieces for each puzzle, placing them as naturally as possible, not artificially close to each other. Then they painstakingly completed each jigsaw and worked out the length and width of the assembled picture. To their surprise, a simple theory predicted the area needed for the pieces regardless of the number. Dr Madeleine Bonsma-Fisher, of the University of Toronto, said she 'gasped' at the discovery. 'The results were the most incredible agreement between theory and data I've ever seen in over a decade of being a physicist,' she added. The research was reported by New Scientist and published on the open-access website arXiv.",
