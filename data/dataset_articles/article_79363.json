  "text": "He had served countless kings, faked many deaths, and bided his time, waiting to find someone worthy of him. Waiting to find someone who wouldn’t use him for his strength, he wanted someone who would appreciate every little kind thing he did. He wished for someone that would voice their opinions, and be respectful and gentle. All the ones that tried to woo him failed, they flirted and gave the simplest gift with little to no meaning. They wore revealing garments in an attempt to make him aroused. But he wasn’t. He was disgusted. He saw what they wanted from him. They wanted power, they wanted fame. They were greedy little monsters. Likewise, they would touch him on his chest, giggle with him, hold his hand and for what? He may have lived with the richest of the richest kings, but no amount of money would suffice for them, they would always want more and more and more. Until they died, and he didn’t. He watched their wrinkly faces relax as they took their last breaths. Some even added his name to their will, they transferred jewellery and articles of clothing. Kindly, he kept them all in a nook, being careful not to shatter or damage any of the gifts. Some of the eager lovers even offered him their children at their time of death, in hopes that one day, his blood could run through their descendants. It was sad. Seeing hopefuls come and go, only wanting him for what he was and not for who he was. It hurt. But he believed in love. He believed that he could and would find someone. He trusted that this world would let him find someone. The world could not be that cruel to him, he has been kind and grateful towards all who were found in his presence. He’d seen people love each other, it was indeed possible. He had seen people caring for each other as if their love was as immortal as he was. He witnessed old lovers dying on a porch, young lovers having their first kiss on a starry night, and young adults getting married while having the brightest of smiles on their faces. But why couldn’t someone love him? He prayed to the gods that someone would love him. That was all he wanted. Love. What a word it was. It brought hurt and tears as much as it brought smiles and laughter. Love could be a poisonous thing, deadly. It could be a lovely thing. It could be stronger than anything in the world, having enough strength to break down the tallest and biggest of walls, it could also be fragile and meek, barely holding on to its support. Love was a funny feeling. It messed with you, laughed and giggled as you sobbed because of it. It was a shadow, following you, making you feel things you didn’t know you could feel. Love pained and wounded people. Love made people ecstatic. He wanted it all, the full package. He wanted to feel love. Oh, dearest world, let me find someone, he begged every night. His shining hazel eyes glistened with tears when he looked up at the fortunate stars. I would rather end my everlasting life than be without a lover. That was all he wanted. Love.",
