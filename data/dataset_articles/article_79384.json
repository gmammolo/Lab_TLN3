Real Simple's Editorial Guidelines Published on December 28, 2023 03:00PM EST We independently evaluate all recommended products and services.

After testing over 250 fashion, beauty, and home products this year, there were a handful that stood out to me.\nAs a shopping writer, plenty of items make their way across my desk, from trendy new beauty staples to multitasking small appliances. I took the time to return to my haul and highlight the items that made the biggest impact on me this past year. Below is a thoughtfully curated list of 16 products I'd add to my cart all over again.\n16 Shopping Writer-Loved Finds From 2023 Our Place Always Pan 2.0 , $105 (was $150); fromourplace.com .

Uniqlo HeatTech Crew Mellow Sock , $8; uniqlo.com . Innbeauty Project Slushy Serum Moisturizer , $30; innbeautyproject.com . Pyrex Deep Glass Baking Dish Amazon\nBuy on Amazon $16 I bought a few of these as backups for Thanksgiving, but their deep design and snug lid made me toss my other shallow glass baking dishes. I'll make a large casserole and conveniently save the leftovers for lunch without wasting plastic wrap or tin foil. Anytime I bring it to a potluck, people always ask me where I bought it.\nJournee Collection Zina Shoe Journee Collection\nBuy on Journeecollection.com $70 When it comes to shoes, I like to stick to a few dependable options to get me through a season. The Zina from the Journee Collection is the perfect mix of classic Oxford style with an edgy twist because of its lug sole and fun patent leather finish. They are a surprisingly lightweight pair that require no break-in period.\nHanhoo Blemish Patch Discovery Kit Amazon\nBuy on Amazon $25 I'm obsessed with hydrocolloid patches, and Hanhoo's seven-piece collection has a patch for just about every blemish situation. Whether I'm dealing with body acne, a gunk-filled T-zone, or dark spots, there is always an option to suit my needs. It's like the perfect first-aid kit for zits.\nUniqlo HeatTech Crew Mellow Sock Uniqlo\nBuy on Uniqlo.com $8 My feet run cold, whether they're in shearling lined boots or a sleek pair of sneakers. I love how thin yet incredibly warm these Uniqlo socks feel. According to the brand, its proprietary HeatTech technology locks in heat while also controlling odors.\nInnbeauty Project Slushy Serum Moisturizer Innbeauty Project\nBuy on Innbeautyproject.com $30 It was love at first touch with the Slushy Serum Moisturizer. After hearing everyone rave about this formula, I finally decided to give it a shot, and I wasn't disappointed. The gel texture is surprisingly hydrating and boasts smoothing bakuchiol, brightening yuzu, and plumping hyaluronic acid that feels like a slushy for your face.\nOur Place Always Pan 2.0 Our Place\nBuy on Fromourplace.com $150 $105 In May, two other shopping writers and I tested the new Always Pan 2.0 from one of my favorite cookware brands, Our Place. I'm happy to report that it still holds up. This little guy lives on my stove and is probably the most-used piece of cooking equipment I own. The nesting spatula feature has also been a game changer.\nNinja 12-in-1 Smart Double Oven Amazon\nBuy on Amazon $350 $250 I can honestly say that I can't remember the last time we used our oven thanks to this do-it-all gadget that bears the brunt of most of my lunches and dinners. I love making multiple dishes at once in this thing due to all of the cooking functions, and it's one of the easiest appliances to use—even my husband and father-in-law sing its praises whenever it's their turn to make a meal.\nShinery Radiance Wash Jewelry Cleaner and Brush Duo Amazon\nBuy on Amazon $56 $45 I have to admit that I never owned a nice piece of jewelry before my engagement ring and wedding band. I couldn't believe how easy it was to get them to shine like new using this cleaner and brush kit. Anytime they start to look dull, I'll just whip this out, and they're clean in minutes with minimal effort.\nShark FlexStyle Air Styling & Drying System Shark\nBuy on Sharkclean.com $300 $250 What was I even doing before the Shark FlexStyle came into my life? Whether I'm going for frizz-free curls or a voluminous blowout, I only need this tool to get it done. The new FrizzFighter Finishing Tool has helped me smooth out my tresses quickly. It's so indispensable to me that I won't travel without it—I make room in whatever luggage I'm using.\nLalais the Blotting Compact Lalais\nBuy on Lalais.com $48 I discovered this generously sized blotting compact thanks to Oprah, who put it on her Favorite Things list this year. The packaging feels so luxe that I have no qualms about whipping it out in the middle of dinner to degrease my T-zone with just a couple of swift pats. This mirror is also the perfect size for on-the-go touchups.\nUrban Decay Vice Lip Bond Glossy Liquid Lipstick Sephora\nBuy on Sephora $27 Finally, a long-lasting lip color that doesn't make my lips feel like the Sahara desert after an hour. \"Test Em\" is the loveliest dusty rose shade that looks gorgeous with bold, neutral, or minimal makeup looks. However, if you're ready to get dramatic, \"Once Strangers\" is the it color of winter.\nGatherall Bra Gatherall\nBuy on Wegatherall.com $68 If you're anything like me and absolutely detest the idea of even putting a bra on for a few hours, you need to try this Gatherall strapless bra. It's the first adhesive silicone bra I’ve tried that hasn't been overly obvious thanks to its super slim design, and it's even sweatproof. Plus, it's super easy to care for.\nVegamour Hydr-8 Leave-In Conditioner Vegamour\nBuy Now $34 Since its launch earlier this year, Vegamour's silky Hydr-8 Leave-In Conditioner has had me in a serious chokehold. I've tried so many different leave-in conditioners, but I always come back to this one because it's one of the few that leave my waves silky and soft without ever weighing them down with product.\nConair Power Steam Garment Steamer Amazon\nBuy on Amazon $43 Whipping out the iron and folding table is a laborious affair that I'd prefer not to do, but I also hate walking around with wrinkled clothing. This travel-friendly steamer heats up in just 35 seconds and gets the job done in no time. You can even switch between 120 and 240 voltages.\niWooly Cordless Vacuum Cleaner Amazon\nBuy on Amazon $150 $80 Our first floor is covered in all tile and hardwood flooring. Combine that with our 3-year-old husky, and we've got nothing but tumbleweeds of fur—that is until we got this vacuum. Due to its lightweight and robust design, we can do swift daily sweeps to effortlessly collect all the dust and dog hair.\nLuxome Ultra Plush Throw Luxome\nBuy on Luxome.com $135 Apparently, I knew nothing about peak coziness until I got my hands on this ridiculously soft and cushy throw blanket. The viscose and bamboo blend feels incredible on my skin and keeps me warm on movie nights. As a matter of fact, this is one of the few items in my house that I refuse to share.\nWas this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!
