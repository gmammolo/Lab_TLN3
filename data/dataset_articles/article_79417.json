  "text": "How J.J. McCarthy’s improved health can benefit Michigan’s offense Through the first seven games of the 2023 season, [J.J. McCarthy](https://www.on3.com/db/jj-mccarthy-50402/) used his legs effectively as he took 27 carries for 160 yards and three touchdowns. In his ensuing six games, though, those numbers dropped as McCarthy took 30 carries for -14 yards and failed to find the end zone with his legs — a different style than [Michigan](https://www.on3.com/teams/michigan-wolverines/) deployed at first. The change came as a result of a lower leg injury McCarthy suffered at some point mid-year. Ahead of the Big Ten Championship, he said he was fully healthy, and he’s had five weeks since that game to get even more rest ahead of the Rose Bowl against [Alabama](https://www.on3.com/teams/alabama-crimson-tide/). McCarthy’s health will be paramount for Michigan in that game, according to [The Wolverine’s](https://www.on3.com/teams/michigan-wolverines/) [Clayton Sayfie](https://www.on3.com/user/claytonsayfie/). If his leg is back to 100%, the Wolverines can get back to getting McCarthy into the run game — a part of his game that will be essential against a tough Alabama defense. “You saw that in the beginning of the year, and then they would kind of dial back a lot of the designed run stuff to try to keep him upright, keep him clean, not use it when they don’t have to,” Sayfie told [Andy Staples](https://www.on3.com/user/andy-staples/) on [Andy Staples On3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xxJrRcHc-0). “I think that could play a part in this game, too — not just his ability to extend the plays and throw downfield. Honestly, too, some of his better plays have been when there’s a breakdown in offensive line protection.” The blueprint for the game could come from an unlikely source. When [Auburn](https://www.on3.com/teams/auburn-tigers/) took Alabama down to the final play, [Payton Thorne](https://www.on3.com/db/payton-thorne-95972/) — Michigan fans know that name from his time at [Michigan State](https://www.on3.com/teams/michigan-state-spartans/) — had 57 rushing yards on 15 carries. The Tigers looked like they were going to pull off the upset before [Jalen Milroe](https://www.on3.com/db/jalen-milroe-54407/) found [Isaiah Bond](https://www.on3.com/db/isaiah-bond-49370/) on the well-documented 4th and 31. That type of game plan could be the key for Michigan in the Rose Bowl. The Wolverines’ running game remains potent with the two-headed monster of [Blake Corum](https://www.on3.com/db/blake-corum-10804/) and [Donovan Edwards](https://www.on3.com/db/donovan-edwards-38163/) in the backfield. Adding McCarthy’s legs to that would make things even tougher on the Crimson Tide. “Watching that Auburn game against Alabama and what Auburn did. [Hugh Freeze](https://www.on3.com/db/hugh-freeze-134705/), give him a ton of credit for what they did with their offensive game plan,” Sayfie said. “They complete [five] passes in that game from the quarterback spot … and you wouldn’t think that that would be some sort of blueprint that they’re looking at going into a college football playoff. “Michigan’s got to do a bunch of other stuff. They also got to stick with what they do. But I think they can do some of what Auburn did in the designed run game for JJ McCarthy. They’ve held it back all year. You’d see it a couple times here and there. But this is a time where you break it out.” Michigan will look to learn from ‘big regret’ with JJ McCarthy’s running ability during last year’s CFP When Michigan and [TCU](https://www.on3.com/college/tcu-horned-frogs/) went back-and-forth in last year’s Fiesta Bowl, McCarthy’s legs became a big part of the second-half offense. He had 10 carries for 57 yards as the Wolverines’ narrowly lost to the Horned Frogs 51-45. It marked the second straight loss in the CFP for Michigan. The hope is the third time will be the charm. The Wolverines could try to avoid holding McCarthy back too long again. After all, they’re facing a mobile quarterback in Jalen Milroe, as well. If Michigan can get JJ McCarthy on the move, that could help in some key short-yargdage situations. “Last year, they didn’t do that against TCU until the second half,” Sayfie said. “It’s a big regret, and it worked really well against that defense. You’ve got to use that. “I think this game’s also going to come down to a lot of 3rd-and-shorts, 3rd-and-mediums for Michigan and whether or not you can stay on the field. Because Alabama’s gonna stay on the field with Milroe, probably. But then again, it’s a key for them, too. So it’s another cliche. Third down, red zone. But there’s so much that goes into it.”",
