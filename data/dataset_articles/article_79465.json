Every day, we hear something new about Samsung's next flagships, and at this point, the only thing missing is official pricing, as practically everything has leaked. New Leak Reveals All Three Samsung Galaxy S24 Variants And Their Specs A big Galaxy S24 leak has exposed everything, including specs and renderings. Today, a fresh spec sheet has surfaced that gives further light on the new phones, specifically the cameras, screens, and processors that Samsung is opting for. It's encouraging to see that Samsung isn't afraid to include excellent displays in all three models. Aside from the resolution of the base model and the screen size differences between the three, all three Galaxy S24 models will use OLED displays with up to 2,600 nits of brightness and a refresh rate of 1-120Hz, according to [WigettaGaming](https://twitter.com/WigettaGaming/status/1739466579362922585). The Ultra model will have a 200-megapixel primary sensor, a 50-megapixel 3x telephoto camera, and a 10-megapixel 5x telephoto camera. A 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera and a 12-megapixel front camera are also included. The other two variants include a 50-megapixel primary camera, a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto camera, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, and a 12-megapixel front camera.
