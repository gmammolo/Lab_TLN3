Trading at $42,598 at the time of writing, BTC is exhibiting neither a sign of increase nor a decrease likely to remain consolidated within the $42,069 and $44,006 range.\nIf Bitcoin price breaches the upper resistance of the range, a bullish breakout could occur, sending BTC beyond $45,000.\nBTC/USD 1-day chart\nBut if BTC falls through the support floor of $42,000, some correction might bring it to $40,000 with an attempt at testing the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) line at $42,000.\nJoin Telegram\n Content\nEditors’ Picks\nXRP price holds above $0.6 as US politicians coalesce to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler\n[]https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/ripple-price-to-extend-consolidation-before-next-bold-move-as-xrp-fills-up-a-triangle-202312282100\nRipple (XRP) price is holding above the $0.6000 support level as crypto proponents double down on the battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its chair, Gary Gensler.
