According to data from\nSantiment, this marks the coin’s highest single-day trading volume since June 2021.\nRegarding where the majority of these trades are being executed, crypto analyst Colin Wu, in a post on X (formerly Twitter), noted that 65% of the trading volume has been “concentrated on Upbit, South Korea’s largest exchange.”\nBitcoin SV (BSV), a fork of Bitcoin, has risen 65% in the last 24 hours. 65% of the trading volume is concentrated on Upbit, South Korea's largest exchange, showing that Korean traders are the main driving force.

At press time, the coin’s Weighted Sentiment was pegged at 1.441, per Santiment’s data.\nThe price surge in the last 24 hours has pushed BSV’s key momentum indicators to multi-month highs, AMBCrypto found.\nThese indicators observed on a 24-hour chart experienced sharp upticks as BSV traded at its year-to-date high. For example, the values of the coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) were 87.16 and 83.47, respectively.\nWhile these values indicated a significant rise in BSV’s buying pressure in the last 24 hours, it also showed that the market was overheated.\nIs your portfolio green?
