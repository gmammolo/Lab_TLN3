Down from its $230 price tag, it has only seen a few previous discounts since its release back during the summer, with Black Friday sales dropping costs down to the lowest prices we have tracked. Today’s deal comes in as a 42% markdown off the going rate, giving you $97 in savings ($7 more than our previous mention) and marking a return to the all-time low from Thanksgiving weekend sales.
