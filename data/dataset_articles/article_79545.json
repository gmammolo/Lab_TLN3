Let’s take a closer look at each for those who like to tap into relative strength.\nShopify\nShopify shares have been monster performers in 2023, up more than 100% amid a broader rebound for growth stocks overall.\nThe company has seen positive earnings estimate revisions across multiple timeframes, landing it into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nShopify’s growth expectations are impossible to ignore, with consensus expectations for its current year (FY23) suggesting 1650% earnings growth on 25% higher sales. Peeking ahead to FY24, consensus estimates allude to a further 50% earnings growth paired with a 20% sales bump.\nThe Gap\nWith more than 3,800 stores worldwide, The Gap is a premier international specialty retailer offering a diverse range of clothing, accessories, and personal care products. Like SHOP, analysts have raised their earnings expectations across the board in a big way.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nInvestors also stand to reap an income stream from GPS shares, currently yielding a solid 2.8% annually. Still, it’s worth noting that the company’s payout hasn’t increased for some time, perhaps steering away those with an income-focused approach.\nThe company has consistently blown away quarterly expectations as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by an average of 140% across its last four releases. Just in its latest print, GPS posted a 190% EPS beat and reported revenue 4% ahead of the consensus.\nShares saw a considerable boost post-earnings, as we can see illustrated below by the green arrow.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nStoneCo\nStoneCo, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), offers an end-to-end cloud-based technology platform to conduct electronic commerce across in-store, online, and mobile channels. Analysts have taken their earnings expectations higher across all timeframes.\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLike SHOP, it’s hard to ignore the company’s growth profile, with earnings forecasted to climb 170% in its current year on 10% higher sales. Peeking ahead to FY24, consensus expectations suggest an additional 35% of earnings growth paired with a 13% revenue increase.\nShares aren’t overly expensive given the forecasted growth, with the current 21.1X forward earnings multiple well beneath the 42.5X five-year median and highs of 140.2X in 2020. The stock sports a Style Score of “C” for Value.\nZacks Investment Research\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nRelative strength investing is all about riding the trend. And when you add in rising earnings estimate revisions, these stocks have the fuel needed to continue climbing.\nFor those seeking stocks with strong momentum and a brightened earnings outlook, all three above – Shopify SHOP, The Gap GPS, and StoneCo STNE – fit the criteria nicely.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
