  "text": "Termed as the project of national importance, India’s longest train tunnel Pir Panjal (or T-80) is the only broad gauge mountain railway in the country that stretches through the Pir Panjal mountain range between Quazigund and Baramulla in Jammu and Kashmir.The 11.2km long tunnel is a part of the 272km Udhampur – Srinagar – Baramulla rail link project undertaken by the Northern Railways. It operates 440m below the existing Jawahar Tunnel, as it is inoperable in winter due to heavy snowfall in the region.\nIn 2013, the trial run of the country’s longest railway tunnel was conducted smoothly, when a train covered the 11 km distance in 20 minutes. It took 30 minutes to cover the entire distance of 17.5 km from Qazigund to Banihal.Initially, the tunnel was the part of 119km Quazigund to Baramulla railway line which became operational in October 2009. The Pir Panjal tunnel reduced the distance between Quazigund in the north to Banihal in the south to just 11km.\nThe 8.4m wide tunnel has a 3m wide road, which runs along the track for maintenance and emergency purposes. The height of the railway tunnel is kept 450m lower than that of the road tunnel so the effect of snow is minimal. Besides, there is provision for ventilation, fire fighting, and safety monitoring in the tunnel.\nIt is important to note that the Banihal and Qazigund region is one of the most treacherous stretches in the entire Kashmir rail network project.Sanctioned in 1994-95, the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail link (USBRL) project (272 km) has a Rs 37,012 crore sanctioned budget, against which, expenditure of Rs 26,786 crore has been incurred up to March 2022.\nOf the 272 km length of the USBRL project, the length of 161 Km has already been commissioned, and work on the remaining stretch of the Katra-Banihal section of 111 Km is underway.\nAs of March 2023, 19 (nineteen) Passenger Special train services are running in the Baramula-Badgam-Banihal section of the USBRL Project. Moreover, the introduction of new train services or extension of existing train services is an ongoing process over Indian Railways subject to traffic demand, operational feasibility and availability of rolling stock.",
