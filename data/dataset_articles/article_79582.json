  "text": "20th Century Studios and Penguin Random House are teaming up to bring the wonders of Ridley Scott’s “Alien” franchise to the pre-schooler crowd. Timed with the 45th anniversary of the franchise, Disney is set to release the kids book “A is for Alien: An ABC Book” next year. The title will be a part of its Little Golden Books line and illustrated by the Disney Storybook Art Team. The synopsis reads: “In space no one can hear you giggle as you read this Little Golden Book featuring the characters from the classic movie Alien! Follow Ripley and the rest of the Nostromo crew on a space adventure that introduces the alphabet from A to Z.” Whether C is for Chestburster and F is for Facehugger will be an actual thing, we’ll have to wait and see. The book is targeted at children 2 to 5-years-old and is releasing on July 9th 2024 – one month before the opening of Fede Alvarez’s “Alien: Romulus” film in cinemas on August 16th. That film precedes a new “Alien” TV series in the works at FX which hails from “Fargo” creator Noah Hawley. Whilst the new film will be set between the events of “Alien” and “Aliens,” the new series will take place many years prior to the first, likely around the time of the events of “Prometheus”. Pre-orders for “A is for Alien,” complete with adorable cover art, are online now at [Penguin Random House](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/743127/a-is-for-alien-an-abc-book-20th-century-studios-by-golden-books-illustrated-by-the-disney-storybook-art-team/).",
