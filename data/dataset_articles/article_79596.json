  "text": "In early December, around 150 students at Bijou Community School joined the Hour of Code event, a global initiative taking place during Computer Science Education Week. The participating pupils engaged in interactive coding exercises, collaborating with peers from different grade levels to gain a deeper understanding of coding principles. The Hour of Code seeks to demystify computer science and inspire students to pursue further learning in the field. This annual [event](https://www.devx.com/terms/event/) occurs in conjunction with the birthday of Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, a computer science pioneer. Its main objective is to raise awareness about [artificial intelligence](https://www.devx.com/devx/how-startups-take-advantage-of-artificial-intelligence/) (AI) and expand young learners’ understanding of computer science, specifically focusing on AI technologies. Bijou Coding Enrichment Club leads the way Members of the afterschool Bijou Coding Enrichment Club shared their computer science knowledge by conducting interactive sessions for 3rd, 4th, and 5th-grade students. Together, they created AI-driven projects, with club members guiding younger students through developing algorithms and programming languages for [AI systems](https://www.devx.com/uncategorized/is-ai-really-elevating-the-automotive-industry-or-just-risking-everyones-welfare/). This hands-on approach ignited curiosity and creativity among participants, emphasizing the importance of acquiring computer science skills as [technology continues to advance](https://www.devx.com/terms/external-serial-advanced-technology-attachment/). Students also created dance party projects, T-Rex themed [video games](https://www.devx.com/artificial-intelligence-ai/is-ais-biggest-revolutionary-potential-for-gaming-going-to-be-for-workflow-and-production-processes/), and musical solar systems in collaboration with NASA, combining scientific discovery and entertainment in a unique way. Dr. Jamie Orr, the club leader [and a parent volunteer, underscored the importance of computer science education in fostering creativity, literacy, and problem-solving abilities in today’s](https://www.devx.com/news/problems-computers-cant-solve/) youth. Support from Lake Tahoe Community College The Lake Tahoe Community College (LTCC) HSI STEM outreach team lent support to the event in line with their mission to build a network for students interested in pursuing careers in STEM fields. Dr. Orr asserted that giving students access to quality computer science educational programs and resources empowers them to develop essential skills that will be valuable in many aspects of their lives. LTCC’s HSI STEM outreach team, in partnership with Bijou Community School, aims to create an engaging environment where students can explore interests and potential [career paths](https://www.devx.com/uncategorized/is-technology-a-good-career-path-how-to-know-if-technology-is-the-right-career-path-for-you/) in the continually expanding STEM fields. Recognition as a Hispanic Serving Institution The US Department of Education recognizes LTCC as a Hispanic Serving Institution, with a commitment to [enhancing](https://www.devx.com/terms/enhancement/) institutional programs and services for Hispanic Americans and other underserved groups. Through culturally relevant educational opportunities, resources, and support, LTCC seeks to improve the academic experience for its diverse student body. This recognition allows the college to [secure](https://www.devx.com/security/unlock-app-security-boost-developer-portals/) additional funding and partnerships focused on advancing equity and social mobility for Hispanic Americans and other traditionally underrepresented communities. Outreach team’s objectives The outreach team’s goals include improving STEM undergraduate education, while also increasing the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of Latino/a/x and other minority students pursuing STEM degrees. To accomplish these objectives, the team employs various strategies, such as workshops, mentorship programs, and inclusive curricular enhancements to ensure all students have access to the necessary resources and support. Moreover, the team collaborates closely with faculty, staff, and community organizations to create a welcoming and supportive learning environment for Latino/a/x and other minority STEM students.
