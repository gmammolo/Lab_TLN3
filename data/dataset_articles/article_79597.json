  "text": "In Independence, Oregon, a committed group of coders is assisting young learners in acquiring essential computer abilities and mastering coding through their involvement in the Youth Coding League. This national nonprofit organization was established to provide children with coding-related problem-solving and mathematical skills. The Youth Coding League offers various workshops, coding lessons, and after-school programs, designed to engage and excite kids about technology and the intricacies of computer software. The organization aims to close the digital divide by making these opportunities accessible to students across diverse socio-economic backgrounds and promoting inclusivity in STEM education. Funding and accessibility of the program The program, which operates from the [local](https://www.devx.com/enterprise/localization-in-business-how-to-build-a-strong-strategy/) public library, is supported by a $15,000 grant from the Oregon Community Foundations’ Thriving Entrepreneurs fund and is accessible to children at no cost. This initiative aims to provide young minds with the tools, resources, and mentorship they need to develop their entrepreneurial skills and foster innovative thinking. By removing the financial barrier, the library encourages participation from children of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, enabling them to explore various [career paths](https://www.devx.com/uncategorized/is-technology-a-good-career-path-how-to-know-if-technology-is-the-right-career-path-for-you/) and opportunities. Current coding teams at the library At present, the library houses two coding teams: one for students in fifth and sixth grades, and another for those in seventh and eighth grades. These two teams provide age-appropriate guidance and challenges to help develop the students’ programming skills and [computational](https://www.devx.com/terms/computer/) thinking. Engaging in collaborative projects, members of each group benefit from the opportunity to learn from their peers while also having access to a wealth of library resources to advance their knowledge. Plans for expansion As plans to broaden the program are underway, an increasing number of children will have the chance to join these teams and hone their coding abilities. This expansion not only aims to create more opportunities for children to develop their coding skills, but also to foster a strong interest in technology from a young age. By cultivating this passion, the program endeavors to nurture a new generation of [innovative thinkers and problem solvers in the world of technology](https://www.devx.com/technology/recruitment-technology-innovation/). Preparing students for the future By offering valuable, practical learning experiences, the Youth Coding League aims to prepare upcoming generations with the necessary resources to thrive in the [digital](https://www.devx.com/terms/digitization/) era. The Youth Coding League not only equips young learners with coding skills but also fosters creativity, confidence, and problem-solving abilities. Through collaborative, hands-on projects, students gain exposure to real-world applications of technology, ensuring they are well-prepared for success in their future careers. Impact on the local community As the program expands, a greater number of children in Independence will benefit from this all-encompassing coding instruction. With the inclusion of more engaging and [interactive](https://www.devx.com/terms/interactivity/) lessons, these young minds will acquire essential coding skills that can significantly impact their future career opportunities. Furthermore, this initiative aims to foster a sense of curiosity and interest in technology, thereby supporting the growth of the local community’s [technological literacy](https://www.devx.com/technology/why-technology-literacy-is-so-important-for-modern-workers/).
