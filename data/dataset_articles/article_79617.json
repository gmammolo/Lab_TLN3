These Windows 11 devices are engineered to deliver a blend of top-tier performance and portability. The LG gram Pro series introduces two flagship models, the LG gram Pro (16Z90SP) and LG gram Pro (17Z90SP), alongside the versatile LG gram Pro 2-in-1 (16T90SP). The 16Z90SP model features a 16-inch WQXGA+ OLED display, offering an impressive 400 nits brightness and a refresh rate of 48-120Hz (VRR). Weighing just 1,199g for the integrated GPU (iGPU) version and slightly more for the discrete GPU (dGPU) model, these laptops are powered by Intel Core Ultra 7 processors, with storage options including dual SSDs up to 1TB (Gen4 NVMe). The 17Z90SP variant boasts a 17-inch WQXGA screen with similar brightness and refresh rate specs, housed in a body weighing around 1,299g (iGPU) and 1,279g (dGPU). Both models are equipped with Intel Arc graphics, offering a maximum of 32GB LPDDR5X memory.
