  "text": "Epic Is Giving Away Marvel’s Guardians Of The Galaxy As part of its daily giveaway, the last title was Ghostrunner. Story Highlights - Popular video game storefront Epic Games has been giving away titles for a while now. - Epic Games’ next holiday freebie title that has been revealed is Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. - Epic’s last freebie was Ghostrunner—a fast-paced action platformer. The Epic Games Store has an event going on for its official storefront, where it’s been giving away a free game daily for over a week now. A while back, it was the [Saints Row reboot](../saints-row-goes-free-to-play-epic-games/), followed by [Ghostrunners](../ghostrunner-free-to-claim-epic-games-store/). Now, it’s [Guardians of the Galaxy](//store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy) by Eidos Montreal and Square Enix, and it’s a generous 100% off on Epic Games at the moment. Redeem it right away to prevent the fear of missing out from kicking in. That said, you’ve got until January 11 to claim the title, and then it’s yours to keep forever. Nonetheless, if you fail to do that in the provided time period, it’s also gone from the storefront to redeem for free … forever. As you can comprehend from the screenshot above, the next game that Epic plans on giving away is Sail Forth, an exploration-based indie revolving around naval gameplay. In my eyes, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun time with fantastic gameplay. Upon its release three years ago, the title was received well by fans and critics alike, praised for the way the developers designed the storyline, along with the constantly amusing interactions between the Guardians. You can’t go wrong with it, especially not when it doesn’t even cost a thing to pick up and play.

Despite strong reviews, the game’s sales on launch undershot our initial expectations,” noted a Q3 briefing in 2022. The report further expressed, “However, sales initiatives that we kicked off in November 2021 and continued into the new year have resulted in sales growth, and we intend to work to continue to expand sales to make up for the title’s slow start.” Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy came out on October 26, 2021, for an array of platforms, including PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch. If you plan on trying out the title on Epic then, here are [all the outfits in the game](/guides/guardians-of-the-galaxy-outfits-location/) that you can unlock down the road. Thanks!
