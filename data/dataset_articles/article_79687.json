  "text": "Shillong, Jan 5: The Indian Air Force is in the process of archiving and digitisation its records to preserve its rich and varied history. The novel project has been christened ‘Project Marut’ after the first indigenous jet fighter, the HAL HF-24 Marut. The project aims to collate, digitise and archive the IAF’s historical records, making them accessible for research and study. It is aimed at preserving history as well as finding the rare gems of historical value that are scattered along the length and breadth of the nation. The IAF has already archived all the records held in its History Cell, including declassified files, photographs, mission reports, operational studies, etc. Innumerable closed files – some dating back to the pre-independence period – have also been identified for preservation. The same is the case with some very old photographs. The aim of scanning the documents was two-pronged: To preserve the documents in digital format and to make them available for research and references by air warriors, air veterans, academicians, and avid civilian military historians. The IAF has also requested veterans and historians to contribute to the endeavour by sharing personal recollections, photographs, log books, etc. Shillong, Jan 5: The Indian Air Force is in the process of archiving and digitisation its records to preserve its rich and varied history.",
