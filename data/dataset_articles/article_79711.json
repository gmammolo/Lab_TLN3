  "text": "Netflix has unveiled the teaser trailer for Arcane Season 2, preparing us not only for the return of the series, expected in November 2024, but also for the debut – in the TV series – of a character that League of Legends players know very well: Warwick. With him, Singed also makes his appearance, intent on observing his creature just from the ceilingwhose hunger for blood is kept at bay only by the chains that keep her imprisoned.\nSinged, gifted with extreme intelligence, is an alchemist from Zaun who, due to increasingly extreme experiments, he has completely lost his mind, going so far as to make him create monsters while ignoring any shred of ethics or humanity. Equally fearsome is Warwick, a beast created following experiments that have enhanced every aspect of it. Large in size, this animal resembles a wolf in features and stands out for the flashy machines that pump alchemical fury through its veins.\nBasata su League of Legends, Arcane is a TV series focusing on Vi and Jynx. The first season consists of nine episodes, at the time published in three courts of three episodes each. The particularly mature tones, combined with remarkable characterization of the characters and crazy artistic direction, contributed to its success.\nThe sound component of the first season is also commendable, composed of songs by groups such as Woodkid and Imagine Dragons, which have led the series to be loved even by those who have never felt the slightest interest in League of Legends. Arcane also won an award at The Game Awards 2022, beating out another heavyweight of videogame adaptations such as Cyberpunk Edgerunners, which then did it again at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards.\nSource: ArcaneShow",
