  "text": "Walmart has the new Super Mario RPG remake for Nintendo Switch for only $47.74. This is the best price we've ever seen for a game that was just recently released (November 17) and better yet, it's a physical copy of the game. The game is sold and shipped by Direct Distributor via Walmart marketplace. I've personally purchased games from them in the past without any problems.\nSuper Mario RPG for $47.74\nSuper Mario RPG is a remake of the 1996 SNES classic. This was easily one of the best Mario games to grace the console back then, and Nintendo did a great job of staying faithful to the game's charm despite the upgrades. A whole slew of improvements have been implemented to bring this game up to modern day standards, including updated visuals, updated music, new gameplay mechanics, and a ton of quality-of-life UI improvements. Still, it's understandably difficult to pay $60 for a remake, so a deal is certainly welcome.\nWe didn't see any significant discount for Super Mario RPG during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. If you prefer a digital copy of the game, the eShop has a \" 2 for $100 \" video game voucher for Switch Online members. Super Mario RPG is an eligible game.",
