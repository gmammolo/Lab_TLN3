  "text": "There are very few animals as important to our world as honeybees. There is, of course, the delicious honey they produce, but they are also [essential in maintaining food security](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/why-bees-are-essential-people-and-planet) and the biodiversity that is threatened by climate change and fast-becoming our [strongest natural defense against it](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/biodiversity). But with the planet facing a climate change-induced [loss of biodiversity](https://www.ipbes.net/news/Media-Release-Global-Assessment#:~:text=The%20Report%20finds%20that%20around,20%25%2C%20mostly%20since%201900.), what happens when [honeybees die](https://apnews.com/article/honeybees-pollinator-extinct-disease-death-climate-change-f60297706e19c7346ff1881587b5aced)? New Northeastern University [research aims to help address the impending biodiversity crisis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-05622-3). The researchers say they have found a new strategy for restoring lost biodiversity by, essentially, identifying the equivalent of a honeybee in different ecosystems and reintroducing it into a particular collapsing ecosystem.
