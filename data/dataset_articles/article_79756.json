  "text": "- A Chinese-German team developed a biocompatible, soft tiny robot with spring-like capabilities, designed for applications in precision medicine, such as microsurgery and targeted drug delivery, detailed in Nature Nanotechnology. - The micro-robot, created by researchers from SIAT, the Leibniz Institute, and Chemnitz University of Technology, features a highly sensitive magnetic spring system that can deform with micron-scale precision. - Boasting a sensitivity that can detect forces as small as one-thousandth the gravity of a single cell, the versatile robot can be shaped for various uses, including as a sperm motility sensor and a tweezer for cell manipulation. “` In a joint effort between Chinese and German researchers, a novel soft robotic device resembling a spring has been created to perform sensitive tasks, including handling individual cells. The study, detailing the creation of this micro-scale robot, has been featured in the journal Nature Nanotechnology. Innovative Micro-Robot Design - Collaboration between the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research Dresden, and Chemnitz University of Technology. - Creation of a magnetic spring system capable of micro-deformations through tiny strains. - Biocompatibility allows for applications in precise medical procedures. Biological Inspiration and Sensitivity - Inspired by biological organisms that utilize spring mechanisms for various functions. - The robotic system’s sensitivity is so acute; it can detect forces as light as one-thousandth of a single cell’s gravity. Potential Medical Applications - Can be shaped to suit various biomedical tasks. - Potential uses include microsurgery tools, targeted drug delivery systems, and cell manipulation tweezers. - Could serve as a sensor to analyze sperm motility. Xu Haifeng of the SIAT, who is the first and corresponding author of the study, highlighted the remarkable sensitivity of the nanoscale spring-like robot, which opens up new avenues for precision medicine and innovative medical robotics.",
