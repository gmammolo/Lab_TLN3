  "text": "- VeChain (VET) has recovered above the $0.03 support level, showing signs of stability after a recent downturn and is now indicating a bullish trend with a “golden cross” pattern on its two-day chart, a technical indicator that last led to a 3,062% price surge. - Crypto analyst AJ suggests that if VET repeats its past performance following the golden cross, the token could potentially reach $1.14 by October 2024. However, it’s emphasized that past performance does not guarantee future results. - Short-term analysis by Teshkid suggests that maintaining support at $0.03 could lead to a rally towards $0.035 and beyond, while a drop below this level might see VET target a lower support zone at $0.024. Following a period of significant volatility, VeChain’s (VET) price appears to be stabilizing, having recently rebounded above the $0.03 support level. This recovery comes after the cryptocurrency experienced a sharp decline. Crypto enthusiasts are now buzzing about a bullish signal on VET’s two-day chart, suggesting the potential for an upward trend in the near future. Golden Cross Signals Bullish Momentum A “golden cross” pattern has emerged for VET, as highlighted by cryptocurrency analyst AJ. This technical indicator is seen when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, hinting at the possibility of a sustained bullish period. Such an event could signify that VeChain is aligning for positive momentum over multiple time frames. - Key support level regained at $0.03 - Golden cross pattern observed on the two-day chart - Indicator suggests potential for a bullish market trend Potential Price Surge to $1.14 by 2024 Analyst AJ suggests that VeChain could experience a significant price increase, potentially reaching $1.14 by October 2024. This projection is based on the historical performance observed in June 2020, where VET saw an impressive 3,062% surge over 300 days following a previous golden cross event. - Historical 3,062% surge post golden cross in 2020 - Projected price target of $1.14 by October 2024 - Golden crosses are considered strong bullish indicators Short-Term Outlook and Support Levels In the immediate future, VET’s price has shown resilience by testing and holding the support level at $0.03. Should this support continue to hold, market watchers like analyst Teshkid predict a potential rally toward higher resistance levels. - Immediate resistance targets at $0.035, $0.038, and $0.04 - Support holding at $0.03 is critical for continued rally - A break below $0.03 could lead to a decline toward $0.024 While precise predictions in the cryptocurrency market are challenging, the recent golden cross event combined with VET’s recovery from its recent dip may offer a glimmer of hope for investors looking for positive momentum in the aftermath of a tough bear market in 2022.",
