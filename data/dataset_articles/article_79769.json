  "text": "FLORES JOURNAL | SCIENCE – Since thousands of years ago, many of us have been looking for answers to the mystery of Atlantis.\nScientists have continued to try to find evidence since the first writings about the story of Atlantis were written by the Greek philosopher Plato more than 2300 years ago.\nMany locations have been proposed as the location of Atlantis. Plato wrote that the capital island of Atlantis was in the sea surrounded by infinite continents. So, is it true that the mystery of Atlantis is on the island of Java,\nIndonesia?\nAlso Read: The Mystery of the Gunung Padang Coin and the Atlantis Story Combined\nDhani Irwanto, an Indonesian hydrological engineer, researched the location of Atlantis through texts written by the Greek philosopher, Plato or Platon in Ancient Greek in 360 BC (BC).\nDhani has been researching the dialogue text Timaeus and Critias since 2010 and published a book entitled “Atlantis The Lost City is in Java Sea, published in 2015”.\nIn his research, Dhani revealed a new theory that the lost island and city of Atlantis were located in the Java Sea.\nAlso read: Nudging from the name of Mount Padang, it turns out that these are the characteristics of the Atlantis region called Plato\nThis hypothesis is outlined in a book entitled “The Lost City of Atlantis on the Island of Java”\nQuoted Flores Journal from YouTube\nvideo meaning of time, Friday, (5/1/2023) The writing of this book is an experience from the writings of Plato, Santos, Oppenheimer and Dhani Irwanto’s own research. Dhani’s research results revealed that the capital of Atlantis was in the Java Sea.\nMore than six years of study has produced evidence that strengthens the theory of Atlantis being in\nIndonesia and shows that Atlantis sank 11,000 years ago and was located in Sundal.\nRegional Evidence of Atlantis That Points to\nIndonesia\nPlato wrote that the capital island of Atlantis was in the sea surrounded by infinite continents, the rest of which were actual oceans. The former city is now under the sea. Unnavigable and impenetrable because it is covered by coral reefs.\nAlso read: Plato designated Athens as part of Atlantis as a mysterious lost city\n2024-01-05 09:55:00\n#Mystery #Revealed #Atlantis #Turns #Java #Sea #Writings #Greek #Philosopher #Plato #Years",
