  "text": "5 hours ago\n”Shields Up” Developing Your Defenses Against Cyber Attacks!\nIn this podcast interview, the speaker will provide best cybersecurity practices for law firms.\nQuestions the moderator will ask the speaker:\n-Law firms deal with a treasure trove of sensitive client information. What are the top cybersecurity threats they face, and how can they effectively guard against them in today's ever-evolving threat landscape?\n-Considering the interconnected nature of legal systems and the vast amount of data transmission, how can law firms ensure the security of client data, both in transit and at rest? Are there specific encryption methods or best practices they should be implementing?\n-Phishing attacks and social engineering are persistent threats, especially with employees as potential entry points. What strategies or training programs do you recommend for law firms to protect their staff from falling victim to these increasingly sophisticated attacks?\n-In the unfortunate event of a cybersecurity incident, what steps should a law firm take in terms of incident response and recovery? How can they minimize the impact and get back on their feet as quickly as possible?\n-Employee training and awareness play a crucial role in any organization's cybersecurity strategy. How can law firms foster a security-conscious culture among their staff, and what ongoing training initiatives would you recommend?\nModerator:\nKevin J. Foster, Sr., - Cybersecurity Operations Coordinator, White and Williams LLP\nSpeaker:\nDr. Eric Cole, Ph.D. - CEO & Founder of Secure Anchor\nRecorded on 01-05-2024.",
