  "text": "While vacuums excel at picking up loose dirt, dust and debris from your floors, when it comes to tackling tough stains and scuff marks, the best mops are the ideal tool for the job. There are several types of mops that are popular today, including spray mops, spin mops and steam mops. However, for your everyday cleaning needs, our top recommendation is the O-Cedar EasyWring RinseClean Spin Mop , a user-friendly option that delivers a thorough clean on any flooring surface.\nIf you're questioning the necessity of a mop, especially if you vacuum regularly, experts say the answer is still yes: “If you have any sort of hard surface in your home for flooring, a mop is a must-have cleaning tool,” says Jessica Samson, cleaning expert for The Maids . “My favorite type of mop is a standard microfiber mop with a bucket that you can use on wet or dry surfaces. This makes it versatile to use on almost any kind of hard surface.”\nNevertheless, the most suitable mop for your home hinges on your cleaning requirements. In compact spaces, spray mops are frequently favored for their compactness and easy storage. Conversely, steam mops offer versatility by being effective on various surfaces, including glass and grout. For those seeking ultimate convenience, the best robot mops are available to handle the cleaning, efficiently scrubbing the floors while you enjoy a moment of relaxation.\nRegardless of the mop style you seek, we’ve curated a selection of the best mops to help keep your home spick and span in 2024.\nBest Mop Overall: O-Cedar EasyWring RinseClean Spin Mop Best Value Mop: Swiffer WetJet Spray Mop Best Mop For Hardwood Floors: Bona Hardwood Floor Premium Spray Mop Best Mop For Tile Floors: Black + Decker Steam Mop Best Steam Mop: Bissell PowerFresh Steam Mop Best Spin Mop: Libman Tornado Spin Mop System Best Robot Mop: Bissell SpinWave Pet Robot Best Oversized Mop: Microfiber Wholesale Store Professional Microfiber Mop Best Mop-Vacuum Combo: Tineco Floor ONE S3\nBest Mop Overall A Popular Spin Mop With Clever Design Features\nO-Cedar EasyWring RinseClean Microfiber Spin Mop & Bucket Buy From Amazon Type: Spin | Dimensions: 12.5 x 11.8 x 19.4 inches | Weight: 3.56 pounds | Mop head type: Reusable\nThe bestselling O-Cedar EasyWring RinseClean Spin Mop delivers a quick and easy clean, making it one of the most popular options on the market right now. This cleaning system includes a microfiber mop and bucket, featuring a unique two-tank system that keeps clean and dirty water separate, preventing the spread of dirt on your floors. To remove excess water from the mop head, a simple push on the foot pedal allows it to spin.\nPlus, the entire system is user-friendly and intuitive. The microfiber head of the O-Cedar mop is triangular, facilitating deep cleaning in corners, and it can be conveniently tossed into the washing machine for hands-off maintenance. Although the mop initially comes with a single cleaning head, the brand offers replacement units for those who prefer having backups. The only drawback is that the mop heads are relatively small, which might require a bit more time for cleaning larger areas.\nPros:\nBucket system provides clean water for rinsing Foot pedal makes it easy to wring out mop Triangular mop head fits into corners easily Mop head is machine washable Cons:\nThe mop head is smaller than others Best Value Mop A Simple Spray Mop That’s Surprisingly Effective\nSwiffer WetJet Spray Mop Starter Kit Buy From Amazon Type: Spray | Dimensions: 11 x 5 x 46 inches | Weight: 3.23 pounds | Mop head type: Disposable\nIf you’re looking for a lightweight, compact mop for quick and convenient use, the Swiffer WetJet is an excellent choice.

Instead, it features a container filled with cleaning solution that attaches directly to the mop. With the push of a button, you can dispense the solution onto your floors for efficient mopping.\nThe WetJet uses disposable mopping pads that easily adhere to the mop head. These pads boast high absorbency and a built-in scrubbing strip enables you to tackle stains and dried-on messes. After cleaning, simply discard the pad, however, keep in mind that you'll need to purchase replacement pads (as well as cleaning solution), and this may become a bit costly if you mop frequently.\nPros:\nLightweight and highly portable Pads have a scrubbing strip to help remove tough stains Disposable mopping pads make for easy maintenance Cons:\nReplacement pads can add up Best Mop For Hardwood Floors A Spray Mop With A Special Hardwood Cleaning Solution\nBona Hardwood Floor Premium Spray Mop Buy From Amazon Type: Spray | Dimensions: 4.5 x 16.56 x 51.1 inches | Weight: 3 pounds | Mop head type: Reusable\nFor homes featuring hardwood floors, the Bona Premium Spray Mop is one of the best options for preserving the wood's pristine appearance. This lightweight spray mop includes a specially formulated hardwood cleaning solution to keep your hardwood floors in top condition, and the cartridge is refillable, which helps to reduce plastic waste and decrease the cost of maintenance.\nEquipped with a sizable 16-inch mop head, the Bona Spray Mop utilizes microfiber pads that effectively trap dirt while remaining gentle on hardwood surfaces. These pads are machine washable up to 500 times, and for added convenience, the brand offers multi-pack replacement pads if you prefer having extras on hand.\nPros:\nLightweight design with large mopping pad Comes with hardwood floor cleaner concentrate Cartridge is refillable to reduce waste Cons:\nSpray nozzle can get clogged Best Mop For Tile Floors A Steam Mop That Includes A Grout-Cleaning Tool\nBlack+Decker Steam Mop Buy From Amazon Type: Steam | Dimensions: 12.8 x 7.3 x 25.4 inches | Weight: 8.5 pounds | Mop Head Type: Reusable\nCleaning tile floors, especially with recessed grout lines, can be challenging, but our research found that the Black+Decker Steam Mop is up for the task. While this versatile mop is designed for cleaning and sanitizing hard floors, it also transforms into a handheld steamer that’s equipped with a grout-cleaning brush for a thorough and deep clean. Additionally, the steam mop comes with a detail brush, squeegee and copper brush, making it a versatile tool for various cleaning tasks in your bathroom, kitchen and more.\nAs an added bonus, it’s effective in killing 99.9% of germs using steam alone, eliminating the need for additional cleaning solutions. Plus, it’s suitable for use on sealed stone, wood and laminate surfaces and with quick heat-up time of less than 30 seconds, it offers adjustable steam levels for different cleaning needs. Keep in mind that this model is corded, requiring proximity to an electrical outlet during operation.\nPros:\nConverts from a mop to a handheld steamer Includes grout brush, as well as other attachments Heats up in less than 30 seconds Cons:\nCorded design limits your range while cleaning Best Steam Mop A Powerful Steam Cleaner With Built-In Scent Discs\nBissell PowerFresh Steam Mop Buy From Amazon Type: Steam | Dimensions: 11.6 x 7.1 x 28.6 inches | Weight: 6.2 pounds | Mop Head Type: Reusable\nThe Bissell PowerFresh Steam Mop is a top-rated option for anyone who wants to clean without chemicals. It’s designed to clean and sanitize hard floors, killing 99.9% of germs and bacteria using hot steam alone. The mop comes with a soft microfiber pad and a more abrasive scrubbing pad, and it has a flip-down scrubbing tool that gets deep into grout lines and helps remove stubborn stains, as well.\nThe Bissell Steam Mop has three steam settings, and its 23-foot power cord provides enough range to clean most rooms. It also comes with two optional fragrance discs that you can insert into the mop to leave behind a refreshing scent as you clean.\nPros:\nCleans and sanitizes using just water Includes two reusable cleaning pads Flip-down scrubbing tool gets into grout lines Optional fragrance discs to leave behind a fresh scent Cons:\nWater reservoir can be tricky to remove Best Spin Mop An Easy-To-Use Option With An Extra-Large Mop Head\nLibman Tornado Spin Mop System Buy From Amazon Type: Spin | Dimensions: 14 x 14 x 53 inches | Weight: 5.44 pounds | Mop head type: Reusable\nYou can quickly clean large areas with the Libman Tornado Spin Mop, which has an extra-large microfiber head. This comprehensive mopping system includes both a mop and bucket, and unlike conventional spin mops where the bucket spins, the Tornado stands out as the mop itself spins to wring out water. All you have to do is simply unlock the lever on the mop's handle and press down. The spinning motion effectively squeezes out excess liquid.\nNoteworthy design features include a generous 2-gallon water capacity, a telescoping mop pole that can extend up to 53 inches for a more comfortable user experience, a large handle and pour spout for easy emptying and a machine washable microfiber head.\nPros:\nLarge mop head covers more area Mop head spins to wring out liquid Pole extends up to 53 inches Cons:\nPlastic mop handle isn’t the most sturdy Best Robot Mop An Autonomous Robot Mop That Will Scrub Your Floors\nBissell SpinWave Pet Robot Buy From Amazon Type: Robot | Dimensions: 12.25 x 12.25 x 3.25 inches | Weight: 13.62 pounds | Mop head type: Reusable\nIn our rigorous best robot mops testing, the Bissell SpinWave Robot came out on top as the most effective model. It features two rotating pads that effectively eliminate stains from various flooring types, employing a systematic back-and-forth pattern for a thorough clean. Notably, the robot autonomously avoids any carpeted areas during its operation. Simply fill its water tank, add a small amount of cleaning solution and let it take care of your floor cleaning needs.\nFor added versatility, the SpinWave Robot can be transformed into a robot vacuum by swapping out its water tank for a separate dustbin. While it can connect to the Bissell app on your phone, its smart features are more limited compared to other robot vacuums—primarily allowing you to start/stop the robot or create a cleaning schedule.\nPros:\nDual scrubbing pads are effective on tough stains Automatically avoids carpeting Doubles as a robot vacuum Cons:\nLimited smart features Best Oversized Mop A Big Microfiber Mop To Clean Large Area\nMicrofiber Wholesale Store 18-Inch Professional Microfiber Mop Buy From Amazon Type: Flat | Dimensions: 18 x 1.8 x 41.2 inches | Weight: 1.95 pounds | Mop head type: Reusable\nFor extensive cleaning tasks, the Microfiber Wholesale Store Professional Microfiber Mop stands out with its expansive 18-inch head, enabling you to cover more area in each pass. Built for heavy-duty use, it features a durable metal handle that telescopes up to an impressive 72 inches, allowing you to adjust it to your preferred height. The mop comes complete with both wet and dry mopping pads crafted from soft microfiber, securely adhering to the mop for stability during use. With a 360-degree swiveling head, you can effortlessly maneuver around furniture and obstacles.\nHowever, it's worth noting that a potential drawback of this mop is the need to remove the entire pad if you wish to refresh it mid-cleaning, as the extra-large size may not fit into most buckets.\nPros:\n18-inch mop head makes it easy to clean large areas Includes pads for wet and dry mopping Sturdy metal handle Cons:\nHarder to wring out than other mops Best Mop-Vacuum Combo A Cordless 2-In-1 Floor Cleaner\nTineco Floor ONE S3 Cordless Floor Cleaner Buy From Amazon Type: Vac-mop | Dimensions: 11.3 x 10 x 43.3 inches | Weight: 9.92 pounds | Mop head type: Reusable\nTypically, most cleaning routines involve vacuuming before mopping to handle larger debris, but the Tineco Floor ONE S3 breaks this pattern as it combines both vacuuming and mopping functionalities in one unit. The popular mop-vacuum has a cordless design that’s easy to drive around on hard floors, and it simultaneously sucks up dirt and other debris while mopping with its spinning brushroll. The unit incorporates separate tanks for clean and dirty water, offering a runtime of up to 35 minutes per charge.\nThe self-propelled design ensures easy maneuvering and the LED display provides real-time information on cleaning status and runtime. Equipped with sensors, the mop-vacuum detects both wet and dry messes, automatically adjusting suction for optimal performance. Additionally, it features a self-cleaning cycle that washes the brushroll and flushes out inner hoses when the mopping task is complete.\nPros:\nVacuums and mop simultaneously Self-cleaning design automatically cleans roller Self-propelled for easy maneuvering Cons:\nNotably more expensive than most other mops MORE FROM FORBES VETTED The Best Bassinets, After Extensive Testing By A Mom And Her Newborn By Alexandra Frost Contributor The Best Swimsuit Brands That Fit Every Style And Budget By Kari Molvar Forbes Staff Why Trust Forbes Vetted The Forbes Vetted team brings substantial expertise in researching, writing about and testing cleaning tools, including the best mops.
