[사진= 게티이미지뱅크]As people get older, more people have difficulty hearing. However, not many people use hearing aids. This is because people are reluctant to wear hearing aids for fear of making them look older. However, research has shown that people need to use hearing aids to live longer than their hearing ability. A study published in the journal Lancet Healthy Longevity found that wearing hearing aids may help prevent premature death. Using data collected from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2012, the researchers surveyed 10,000 adults aged 20 or older who had received a hearing evaluation and completed a questionnaire about hearing aid use, and followed them for 10 years. did. As a result of the survey, 1,863 of the participants were confirmed to have hearing loss. Of these, 237 responded that they used hearing aids more than once a week, more than 5 hours a week, or more than half of the time regularly, while 1,483 people responded that they did not use hearing aids at all. People who responded that they wore hearing aids less frequently than once a month were classified as irregular users. As a result of the follow-up study, the mortality rate of hearing patients who did not use hearing aids was 24% higher than that of hearing patients who regularly used hearing aids. This difference was consistent regardless of degree of hearing loss, age, race, income, education and other demographic characteristics, and medical history.
