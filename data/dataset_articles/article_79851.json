Vibration meters are the basic data logger devices representing machine vibration readings. Most vibration meters are battery-operated and consist of monochrome or digital LCD. These devices are portable and present a simple and convenient way to monitor vibrations. However, unlike vibration analyzers, they provide simple readings onscreen with no alarm level or reference to the previous readings or perhaps vibration standards in rotating machines. Further, portable vibration analyzers are effective, convenient, accurate, and mobile tools that have feature memories to store the vibration measurement data for further analysis. On-premises segment is expected to hold a substantial market share during the forecast period. Machine condition monitoring solutions and systems are deployed at the user's premises to ensure complete control over the data flow, enabling data security. This is one of the key reasons for adopting the on-premises machine condition monitoring solutions and systems. On-premises machine condition monitoring solutions and systems collect real-time data with high accuracy, reducing the response time to resolve issues. Machine condition monitoring solutions deployed on the company premises ensure complete control and security of its data. This leads to increased adoption of on-premises solutions. However, high installation, setup, and maintenance costs restrict the adoption of on-premises deployment of machine condition monitoring solutions and systems. Aerospace industry segment to grow at an impressive CAGR during the forecast period. Aerospace is a rapidly growing industry, and there is a constant need to enhance the reliability of machines to avoid production losses occurring due to machinery breakdowns. In aircraft manufacturing, more than one condition monitoring technology is used to monitor the condition of critical machines, resulting in the generation of large volumes of data. Advanced algorithms are used to develop condition monitoring systems and solutions to accommodate various analytical technologies. The use of artificial intelligence for condition monitoring enables companies to efficiently detect potential faults in machinery, thereby minimizing production losses.
