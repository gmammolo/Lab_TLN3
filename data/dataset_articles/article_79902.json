  "text": "- Rapidgator has been added to our approved mandatory hosts while Uploaded as been removed. These hosts are not to be used in combination with each other unless a second approved mandatory is used. See our file host rules for more information. [Dismiss Notice](account/dismiss-notice?notice_id=155) - Guest - Remember that Thread Prefixes are a search tool! Click on a Thread Prefix and all threads with the same Prefix in that forum will be offered to you. To dismiss click on X >>> [Dismiss Notice](account/dismiss-notice?notice_id=160) - Our gif only content threads have a rule where all thumbs must be posted as a static thumbnail that does not play. Currently imagebam made a change where they no longer produce static thumbs. Therefore, please do not use imagebam, or any host, that provides live playing gifs in those specific threads. If you see your gif playing once you post, try to use a smaller thumbnail and if that does not work use a different approved host. [Dismiss Notice](account/dismiss-notice?notice_id=180) - The 'Social Media NSFW' forum has been renamed 'Social Media Personalities', and henceforth will be the main home for Social Media content on phun.org. Keep an eye on changing rules/guidelines in both the 'Celebrity Extra' forum and the renamed 'Social Media Personalities' forum. The 'Celebrity Extra' forum will in future be restricted to content relating to 'Hollywood-style' Celebrities only. Speak to a Staff Member if you require clarification. [Dismiss Notice](account/dismiss-notice?notice_id=205) - Can't Log-in?. If your password is no longer accepted but the email address registered in your profile is working, use the \"Forgot Your Password?\" routine. However, if your registered email address is unusable, create a new temporary phun account and contact S-type. [Dismiss Notice](account/dismiss-notice?notice_id=50) - ATTN: Imagehost picpie is infected with the \"internet security warning\" redirect that tries to take users hostage with an inescapable redirect. Avoid using picpie as an imagehost. [Dismiss Notice](account/dismiss-notice?notice_id=75) - Too many Alerts? Why not adjust your \"Alert Preferences\" in your Profile Page?
