  "text": "Immunize Infants with Beyfortus As Quickly As Possible The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today announced a change in its guidance regarding using Nirsevimab (Beyfortus™) in a Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity email. As of January 5, 2023, the CDC says that infants and children recommended to receive Beyfortus should be immunized as quickly as possible. [Beyfortus](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/beyfortus-nirsevimab-rsv-antibody) is the first U.S. FDA-approved extended half-life monoclonal antibody offering young children passive immunization to prevent lower respiratory tract infections caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Given the recent increase in Beyfortus supply and the manufacturers’ plan to release an additional 230,000 doses in January 2024, the CDC now advises healthcare providers to return to recommendations put forward by the CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on the use of Beyfortus in young children. Furthermore, healthcare providers should not reserve Beyfortus doses for infants born later in the season when RSV circulation and risk for exposure to RSV may be lower. On October 23, 2023, the CDC issued Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory #499 to provide guidance for the prioritization of Beyfortus given the limited supply. In the setting of increasing supply, healthcare providers should administer a single dose of Beyfortus to all infants aged under eight months and children aged 8 through 19 months at increased risk. The CDC is working closely with jurisdictional partners to ensure adequate supply through the Vaccines for Children Program. Moreover, [neither approved RSV vaccine](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/rsv-vaccines) (Abrysvo, Arexvy) is approved for use in infants or young children. Healthcare providers should take care to use the correct product for the correct population, says the CDC. In early 2024, RSV activity remained elevated nationwide and increased in many parts of the country. However, decreased activity has been observed in the Southeast area of the United States, such as Florida. A [HAN](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/index.asp) is the CDC’s primary method of sharing information about urgent public health incidents.",
