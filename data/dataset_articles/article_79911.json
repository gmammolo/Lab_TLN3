  "text": "This battle looked like a carefully orchestrated scene out of a movie. It took place in Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, Botswana, Southern Africa. A group of ground squirrels sought to drive a deadly cobra out of their territory, but they had to move cautiously. This is crucial when one considers that snakes commonly prey on squirrels. The squirrels kept their distance to begin until one stepped up to bravely challenge the cobra. The rest of the group, or “scurry,” began to surround the venomous reptile while the challenger distracted it. One by one, the squirrels took turns attempting to strike the cobra, but its blazing-fast reflexes and striking power kept the rodents at bay. That is, until a scrappy mongoose entered the scene. The mongoose rushed in confidently, closing the distance between itself and the cobra. As we noticed, the snake and the mongoose exchanged blows but kept enough space to avoid the other’s devastating bite. However, the pressure applied by the mongoose, along with the squirrels in the background for backup, was enough to send the snake slithering away. Teamwork surely paid off that day. According to the video notes, the ground squirrels were on high alert, hoping to protect their underground burrow (and offspring) from the deadly wrath of the cobra. Who knows if they would have been successful if the mongoose hadn’t shown up? The war between mongooses and cobras is more common than you might think. Let’s explore what makes these weasel-like mammals a dangerous opponent to snakes. Not only are mongooses quick and agile, but they also have sharp claws and are resistant to snake venom. ©Michel VIARD/iStock via Getty Images One mongoose is a tough enough task for a cobra to overcome, so imagine an entire group. A band of mongooses goes by many names, such as a “troop,” “committee,” “mob,” etc. These groups are often comprised of around 40 individuals and are a tight-knit community. Mongooses are a dangerous rival to cobras for a variety of reasons. Mainly, they possess a unique adaptation that makes them resistant to snake venom . These mammals also have sharp, curved claws on their front feet, which they use for scratching and digging. They also have short but heavy claws on their hind feet. Additionally, mongooses are agile and have impressive reflexes, as we saw in the above footage. Unfortunately for the cobra, it slithered into the wrong burrow that day.
