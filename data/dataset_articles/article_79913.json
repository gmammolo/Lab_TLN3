  "text": "- Teleportation already exists! - The scientists teleported the face Scientists believe they have taken the first major step towards real- world teleportation, bringing Star Trek technology out of the science-fiction genre and into the physical realm. Don’t miss: Unexplained teleportation from 1593: A man is said to have traveled 14,000 kilometers in a split second! Teleportation is indeed possible Researchers from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and The Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO) in Spain report a breakthrough discovery. As part of their experiment, they used a technique that transmits images using an advanced form of quantum communication. As The Sun writes, it uses quantum physics to transmit information and essentially sends information in ones and zeros. Scientists have used quantum optics to expand this “alphabet” so they can send more complex pieces of information – such as a fingerprint or a photo of a face. According to the researchers, this new approach uses a “teleportation-inspired configuration” rather than physical image transmission. This means that information does not physically travel between communicating parties as in the case of smartphones or broadcast television. Moving people will be a challenge “Traditionally, two communicating parties physically send information from one to the other, even in the quantum realm,” says lead researcher Andrew Forbes, a professor at Wits University. “However, it is now possible to teleport information so that it never physically travels through the link – so the technology from ‘Star Trek’ is slowly becoming a reality.” According to the researchers, the key was the use of a non-linear optical detector that allowed any “pattern” to be sent, such as a photo of a human face . “This protocol exhibits all the hallmarks of teleportation except for one essential component: it needs a bright laser beam for the nonlinear detector to be effective, so the sender might know what is to be sent, but doesn’t have to,” explains Forbes. “It’s not exactly teleportation in that sense, but we could achieve it in the future if we could make the nonlinear detector more efficient.” Preview photo source: Pixabay, source: The Sun 2024-01-05 13:04:24 #Teleportation #reality #Scientists #report #realizing #Star #Trek # technology",
