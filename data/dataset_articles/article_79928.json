  "text": "Molecular Partners and Orano Med: Blasting Cancer Cells with Radio-DARPin Therapies\nPublished / Modified Jan 05 2024\nCSIMarket Team / CSIMarket.com\nMolecular Partners and Orano Med Team Up to Develop Cutting-Edge Radio-DARPin Therapies to Combat CancerSwitzerland and CONCORD, Mass., and PARIS, Jan. 05, 2024 - In a significant move towards innovative cancer treatments, Molecular Partners AG and Orano Med have announced a strategic collaboration to co-develop Radio-DARPin therapeutics (RDTs). Molecular Partners, a clinical-stage biotech company known for its DARPin therapeutics, and Orano Med, a leading expert in targeted alpha therapy, aim to utilize Orano Med's 212Pb radioisotope as a payload to selectively eliminate cancer cells. Focused on advancing multiple oncology targets, with DLL3 being the first target, both parties have committed to sharing the costs of preclinical and clinical development, utilizing their unique expertise to expedite the development process.\nZURICH-SCHLIEREN,\nZURICH-SCHLIEREN,\nThe partnership between Molecular Partners and Orano Med holds great promise for revolutionizing cancer treatment. Molecular Partners' DARPin therapeutics are a groundbreaking class of custom-built protein drugs that offer enhanced specificity and potency. By combining these capabilities with Orano Med's expertise in targeted alpha therapy, which utilizes alpha radiation to precisely target cancer cells, the collaboration hopes to deliver highly effective and precise treatments for cancer patients.\nThe introduction of Radio-DARPin therapeutics signifies a major advancement in cancer therapy. Traditional cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, often lack precision and can cause significant side effects due to their non-selective nature. Radio-DARPin therapies have the potential to address these limitations by harnessing highly targeted alpha radiation payloads to specifically kill cancer cells, leaving healthy cells unharmed. This precision has the potential to not only improve patient outcomes but also minimize the often debilitating side effects associated with traditional cancer treatments.\nThe first target identified by Molecular Partners and Orano Med for their collaboration is DLL3, a protein found in certain types of cancer. DLL3 has been identified as a promising target due to its high expression in certain aggressive cancers, including small cell lung cancer and metastatic prostate cancer. By leveraging the unique capabilities of Radio-DARPin therapeutics, researchers hope to develop a highly effective treatment for patients affected by these challenging cancers.\nThe collaborative efforts between Molecular Partners and Orano Med highlight the growing importance of partnerships in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries. By combining their respective expertise and sharing the costs of development, the two companies can accelerate the translation of these groundbreaking therapies from the lab to the clinic. The agreement between the two companies demonstrates their commitment to leveraging scientific innovation for the benefit of patients in need.\nWith cancer remaining a leading cause of death worldwide, the development of targeted and precise therapies is crucial. The partnership between Molecular Partners and Orano Med represents a significant step towards advancing the field of cancer therapeutics. By harnessing the power of Radio-DARPin therapeutics and targeted alpha therapy, researchers aim to provide patients with more effective treatments that minimize side effects and improve outcomes.\nPrevious News\n<a href=\"https://csimarket.com/news/apellis_pharmaceuticals_bolsters_workforce_with_strategic_equity_inducement_grants2024-01-05210502\">\nApellis Pharmaceuticals Bolsters
