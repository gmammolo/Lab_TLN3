  "text": "The number of dolphins sighted on the coasts of the port of Progreso has exceeded the figures recorded in previous years, according to the Ecological Police.\nThe head of the corporation, Obdulio Mena Sánchez, explained that in 2022, four strandings of dolphins that arrived on the coast without vial signs were attended to. While in 2023, five cases have been recorded.\nThe last stranding occurred in October, and the Ecological Police personnel were in charge of securing the area and burying the organism.\nMena Sánchez called on the population to avoid touching the dolphins that arrive on the coast of Progreso since they could carry microorganisms that are harmful to health.\n“When the report is verified, the specimen is secured, measurements are taken and the corresponding protocol is followed before burying it on site, awaiting the arrival of UADY biologists,” he explained.\n“Dolphins should not be touched without gloves, since it is not known what diseases they may carry, in addition to being carriers of salmonella and other diseases that could be transmitted to humans,” he added.\nThe population was also urged to make the corresponding reports to guarantee that the established protocols in case of strandings are followed.\nTYT Newsroom",
