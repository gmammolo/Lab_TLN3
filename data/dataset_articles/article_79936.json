  "text": "The newest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Warzone bundle includes an SMG that features a silly animation that references the annoying “Update Requires Restart” message players commonly encounter when trying to boot up either game. Just be prepared to spend $20 to get this new gun.\nWatch This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign\nCC Share\nSubtitles\nOff English Share this Video\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nReddit\nLink\nview video This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign Cyberpunk 2077 's Phantom Liberty DLC Probably Won’t Change V’s Fate July 31, 2023 Why The Hot New Redfall Gameplay Trailer Left Us Feeling Cold June 16, 2022\nCall of Duty games released in the last few years have frustrated fans with a prompt asking them to restart the game due to an update. This message often appears before jumping into the main menu. While on console this restart might only take a few seconds, PC players might have to wait a minute or more before they can start playing. It’s been a problem since at least 2020 and is still a thing in MWIII and battle royale spin-off Warzone . The message has become so ubiquitous over the years that it has become a meme within the CoD community. And Activision is ready to laugh at itself while taking some money from you, too.\nAdvertisement On January 5, the “ Insert Coin Mastercraft” cosmetic bundle appeared in MW III and Warzone ’s in-game stores. While the bundle includes a bevy of cosmetics—including a new ‘80s-themed outfit, loading screen, and player emblem—The Arcade Rhythm submachine gun is the coolest part of the pricey pack.\nAdvertisement Advertisement That’s because if you inspect the weapon, you’ll be treated to your soldier bringing the SMG up to their face, trying to log into Call of Duty by mashing a button, and then being greeted with the annoying update prompt. This leads to the soldier bashing the gun in frustration, which likely mimics how many CoD players have reacted to the prompt.\nI’m not a Call of Duty player anymore these days, but I’ll admit that it’s nice to see this franchise, which is usually so damn serious, make fun of itself. Plus, the Arcade Rhythm SMG comes with a neat pixel-death effect that basically de-rezzes everyone you kill, Tron style. And it even features pixelated muzzle smoke, which is a nice touch.\nAdvertisement Once again Call of Duty keeps tempting me with cool retro video game skins and weapons, like that Doom shotgun from last year . And once again I have to hold strong. I’m already spending too much money on Fortnite . I can’t afford another battle royale in my life.\n.\nShow all 1 comments",
