  "text": "The popular South Korean webcomic Solo Leveling has finally made the transition to screen and – after a lengthy wait – fans won't be disappointed. Solo Leveling was first introduced to fans back in 2015 as a Korean web novel written by Chugong. It was later adapted into a webtoon and Manhwa in 2018 amassing a massive following worldwide. Now, after nearly a decade the creators' attempts to bring the world of super-powered hunters versus hordes of monsters to anime form has resulted in something invitingly dark and exciting. So what are you in for if you’re unfamiliar with the source material?The anime's main protagonist Sung Jin-woo serves as the underdog with heart. Weaker than the other hunters, Jin-woo finds himself desperate to embark on these life-threatening missions not to prove himself for glory but so that he can support his family with money he receives from them.His try-hard attitude and sacrificial character traits are a delicate balance to get right and could easily come off as cheesy, and yet there is something endearing about the way in which they show up that cause you to root for him instead of roll your eyes.And Jin-woo will need all the rooting-for you can muster, as his journey opens up Solo Leveling's thickly gory, dramatic world laced with mystery. The show's focus for the first couple of episodes is, in part, on world building which here means quite a lot of info dumping interspersed between the action. It's a clunky storytelling approach but not unusual for the genre and Solo Leveling more than makes up for any slower moments with graphic action sequences that are guaranteed to keep you on edge. While its gruesome visuals deliver a thrilling shock factor thanks to the stunning art direction, they are anything but baseless carnage. Solo Leveling backs up dismemberment of limbs and slicing bodies in half by quickly building emotional connections to the characters and exploring their relationships with one another and their motivation for taking the risks they do. The pacing feels spot on when the danger becomes more pronounced, thanks to the way the show makes a habit of cutting to scenes showing characters’ personal lives outside of their mission. So far it is a compelling start with plenty of intrigue to build upon – and perfect to fill that monster-fighting hole in your heart while we wait for the next instalments of Jujutsu Kaisen and Demon Slayer.Solo Leveling will be available to watch weekly on Crunchyroll from the 6th January.",
