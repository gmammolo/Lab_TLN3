  "text": "Once blanketing North America in the tens of millions, the iconic bison was brought to the brink of extinction by overhunting in the 1890s. Some estimates put the total surviving population at a paltry 300 animals. The “Great Slaughter” of the American bison between 1820-1880 changed the landscape of the American West forever. Today, while about 360,000 plains bison are privately owned as domestic livestock, about 31,000 wild bison roam free in national parks and refuges in the United States and Canada. Oklahoma is home to a few large wild herds. The Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge in Comanche County and the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Osage County maintain bison herds. The Oklahoma Historical Society also manages a herd near Pawnee, OK. Oklahoma paved the way in 1972 when it adopted the bison as its state mammal. In 2016, the United States followed suit and made the bison its national mammal. Perhaps no other symbol is as iconic of the American West as the bison. 1,262 People Couldn't Ace This Quiz Think You Can?
