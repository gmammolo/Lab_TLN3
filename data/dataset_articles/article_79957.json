  "text": "As vasectomy interest piques , a new contraceptive for men is showing promising results in early trials. Billed as an “IUD for men,” ADAM , a first-of-its-kind water-soluble hydrogel, was found to significantly reduce sperm motility and concentration similar to that of a vasectomy — the difference being that the effects of the hydrogel are reversible. “We are thrilled to share these positive results which we believe take us one step closer to transforming the contraceptive landscape,” Kevin Eisenfrats, the co-founder and CEO of medical device company Contraline, said in a statement obtained by The Post. The preliminary data, released on Thursday, “suggests that it is possible to achieve similar levels of efficacy as long-acting female contraceptives like IUDs,” or intrauterine devices, which are more than 99% effective he added. “Ultimately, I’d like to make ADAM become a ‘no brainer’ for men when it comes to considering their options for contraception,” Eisenfrats said. The novel preventative technology is the latest in the pursuit of developing a contraceptive for men ; however, according to Contraline, the company is the first to make considerable progress compared to its competitors. Contraline’s initial testing of 23 healthy men, who were aged 25 to 65 and located in Australia, found a 99.6% to 100.0% reduction of motile sperm within 30 days of the noninvasive procedure, during which the hydrogel was injected into the reproductive tubes, called the vas deferens, to block sperm from entering the semen. The 20-minute procedure, which is completed under local or general anesthesia, involves piecing the scrotum and inserting the hydrogel through a catheter attached to the vas deferens, according to Wired . The participants, who were required to have “normal semen parameters,” were divided into two groups and received different amounts of hydrogel, which had a 100% successful implantation rate. They did not report any severe reactions, and any adverse effects that were reported were mild. “I am pleased with the early results we are seeing from the trial; it is exciting to see the preliminary outcomes showing ADAM is safe and effective,” urologist Dr. Peter Chin, an associated professor at the University of Wollongong in New South Wales, said in a statement. The participants will be monitored through follow-ups to analyze the long-term effects of ADAM. In the meantime, Contraline plans to file an Investigational Device Exemption this year before launching a trial in the U.S. The nearly two dozen volunteers for the “first-in-human” trial were selected from a pool of 1,500, the high level of interest suggesting “a major need for this type of contraception,” Chin noted. “Right now, there is nothing out there that’s long-lasting and reversible for men,” Eisenfrats told Wired. “This is made for people who are not ready to have kids, are spacing out having kids, or think they are done having kids but maybe not ready for that permanent option.”",
