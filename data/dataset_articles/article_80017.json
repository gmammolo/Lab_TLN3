  "text": "NASA's Juno spacecraft captures images of Jupiter's moon Io, the most volcanic body in the solar system A NASA spacecraft is providing earthlings with an out-of-this-world look at what [NASA](/article/nasa-laser-message-beams-video-of-cat-back-to-earth/46175735) calls “the solar system’s most volcanic world.” NASA has released images of Jupiter’s moon Io after the [Juno](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/juno/) spacecraft, on Dec. 30, flew within 932 miles of the moon in the Jovian System. It’s the closest a spacecraft has come to Io in more than two decades, and is [Juno Mission's](/article/jupiter-s-mysteries-first-results-from-the-juno-mission/9932757) “closest-ever approach to Jupiter’s moon,” NASA said. “Juno captured Io’s molten surface and will return for another look in February,” [NASA said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.](https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1742310312571760843?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) Scientists hope Juno’s flyby will help in better understanding the nature and diversity of the Jovian moon’s volcanoes, [according to an article published by NASA after the spacecraft flew by Io.](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/juno/nasas-juno-to-get-close-look-at-jupiters-volcanic-moon-io-on-dec-30/) Juno, an \"orbiter,\" launched Aug. 5, 2011, and arrived at Jupiter in 2016 to explore the Jovian System, according to NASA's webpage dedicated to the mission and the craft.
