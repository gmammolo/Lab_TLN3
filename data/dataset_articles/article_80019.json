  "text": "Square Enix has\nannounced that their free-to-play mobile game Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis will add the fifth chapter of the main story of the original Final Fantasy VII story adaptation on January 11, 2024, at 6 PM PT/ 9 PM ET. Titled “The Wide, Wide World,” Yuffie will also be added as a playable character.\nFurther, speaking of Yuffie, the\n“Happy New Year: The Wily Hunter” event is now available until January 11, 2024, at 4:59 PM PT/ 7:59 PM ET. Players can collect specific items and exchange them “for the limited Glenn-exclusive weapon Best Wishes or Character-Specific Memories.”\nSpecial festive attire for Yuffie will also be made available:\nFinal Fantasy VII Ever Crisis is an ambitious entry that coalesces the compilation of Final Fantasy VII, including the original game, Crisis Core, Dirge of Cerberus, Before Crisis, and even Advent Children in playable forms. The gacha comprises new outfits for the cast, adding levity and spiciness to familiar events fans are abundantly knowledgeable about.\nThe original Final Fantasy VII’s portrayal will feature new lines and adapt light novel material written by Nojima, such as when Tifa meets AVALANCHE in Traces of Two Pasts. Story updates are planned once a month, with seemingly one chapter each time.\nFinal Fantasy VII Ever Crisis is available on mobile devices via iOS and Android and PC via\nSteam. The game has achieved seven million downloads worldwide.\nThis post may contain Amazon affiliate links. As an Amazon Associate Noisy Pixel earns from qualifying purchases.",
