  "text": "MOUNTAIN HOME, Ark. (KY3) - Members of the Mountain Home, Ark. Bomber Football team didn’t spend Thursday practicing new plays, instead, they played a role in helping their community clean up from May’s EF-3 tornado. “Very humbling. Just to see these guys come out here. They showed up early and just absolutely killed it,” Marshall Bockman, whose property was heavily damaged by the tornado, said. The team, including both players and coaches, helped Bockman pick up debris across his property. “Hands on the ground. Piling in areas. I’ll bring equipment in to follow up after they leave, where we can safely remove it from the property,” Bockman explained. For Junior Caden Delsoto, he says before the tornado, the team had already decided to volunteer more, and this was a great opportunity to do so. “We wanted more volunteer hours and to really build our community, so we decided to come out and help people who needed help, and in this case, it was cleaning up debris left by the tornado,” Delsoto stated. The reason why? To give back to the community that supports his team throughout the year. “We have an amazing community. Amazing people support us. When we get the opportunity to support people when we can, it’s always good to take the chance,” Delsoto said. While Thursday’s help from the team was great assistance to those hit, Coach Steve Ary said it’s also a learning moment for his players. “These guys have been leaders of their community on down the road. They need to learn to take care of it. Be invested in it. All those things are going to make sure they’re good citizens on down the road,” Ary explained. The property owner said with so much happening within the last month, it’s nice to see something positive. “Just to see these young men, they’re not kids, they’re young men. Just to see that. It lifts me up. I don’t have a lot of wins every day,” Bockman added. To report a correction or typo, please email [digitalnews@ky3.com](mailto:digitalnews@ky3.com) Copyright 2024 KY3.
