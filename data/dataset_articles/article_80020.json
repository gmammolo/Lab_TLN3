  "text": "Steam drops 7 gorgeous RPGs you can download and play free now Published | Last updated Featured Image Credit: Valve/Bandai Namco Every now and again all gamers get the urge to lose themselves in a massive RPG. The tricky part, I have found, is working out which RPG to choose. It's a big investment, right? You're trying to work out which game you're going to give potentially hundreds of hours of your time to, and that's not an easy decision. I say this as someone with hundreds of hours on [The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt](https://www.gamingbible.com/the-witcher) across multiple platforms, because I'm often too scared to try something new. [Not that there's anything wrong with that](https://www.gamingbible.com/news/gamers-insist-replaying-the-same-storybased-games-is-never-a-waste-990363-20231016), mind you. Take a look at upcoming open-world RPG Greedfall 2 below! Loading… One of the good things about [Steam](https://www.gamingbible.com/steam) is that there are loads of [free demos](https://www.gamingbible.com/free-games) to choose from, which means you can make a much more informed decision about your next RPG adventure. I've rounded up seven free demos for seven excellent RPGs, so if you're looking to sink your teeth into something substantial but don't where to start, you've come to the right place. Take a look below! [Final Fantasy XIV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312060/FINAL_FANTASY_XIV_Online_Free_Trial)- One of the biggest and most-played MMORPGs around, FFXIV has a massive free trial you can get stuck into right now. [Sea Of Stars](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1244090/Sea_of_Stars)- This 2023 game is an absolute gem. I gave it a 9/10 in my [review](https://www.gamingbible.com/reviews/playstation-plus-new-free-game-2023-masterpiece-013895-20230818), and it landed in GAMINGbible's [top games of the year.](https://www.gamingbible.com/features/gamingbibles-10-greatest-video-games-2023-877417-20231212) [Octopath Traveller 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971650/OCTOPATH_TRAVELER_II)- I've actually just started playing this one myself and I'm obsessed. [Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot](https://store.steampowered.com/app/851850/DRAGON_BALL_Z_KAKAROT)- An absolute dream come true for Dragon Ball fans, this one. [Magicraft](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2103140/Magicraft)- A really cute-looking blend of Hogwarts Legacy and Cult Of The Lamb. [Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes Of An Elusive Age Definitive Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295510/DRAGON_QUEST_XI_S_Echoes_of_an_Elusive_Age__Definitive_Edition)- I can't stress how hard this game slaps. One of the very best RPGs you'll ever play. Just a stunning piece of work. [Tales Of Arise](https://store.steampowered.com/app/740130/Tales_of_Arise)- A beautiful, massive action-RPG. A little slow to start, but well worth a look. Hopefully you've got some good options there. Of course the beauty of a demo is you can try a few things on and see what fits, so jump in and have fun.
