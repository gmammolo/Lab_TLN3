  "text": "An air fryer dinner at the beach, made possible by the charge of an electric vehicle. (Supplied)\nElectric vehicle (EV) owners have used their cars to power homes during Queensland’s extended electrical blackouts, including a couple who ran many of their household appliances off their EV – even an air fryer to cook a hot dinner.\nWith thousands of residents in the state’s south-east still without power after the Christmas Day tornado, some EV drivers in the storm zone defied the blackouts, using their cars as generators.\nEVs have the benefit over petrol or diesel generators in that they are silent and do not emit fumes, which can pose asphyxiation dangers.\nAndrew Panshin, a bus driver of New Beith in Logan, south of Brisbane, lost power for about two days from 9pm on Christmas night as he and 17 members of his family members were celebrating the festive season.\nBut while some storm zone residents pondered how they would keep Christmas leftovers from spoiling, Mr Panshin simply attached his fridges and freezers to his electric car.\nHe said the “vehicle to load” (V2L) feature of his $50,000 BYD ATTO3 electric car also allowed him to power a pedestal fan and their mobile phones.\n“We had the kettle going to make our morning cup of tea, and the air fryer to heat up some really unhealthy food,” Mr Panshin said.\n“It got us through. We never bought it for that reason, but it does the job.\n“We were off power for two days and we could have got another three days out of it quite easily.”\nThey used the car’s 50-kilowatt hour battery to power their internet and television, allowing them to stream their favourite shows.\nMr Panshin said he had also heard of other EV owners using their cars to power washing machines during the electricity disruption.\n“We weren’t that desperate, but hey, it would work,” he said.\nMore than convenience for some In 2023, about 87,000 new battery electric vehicles were sold in Australia, but not all models have the V2L feature.\nEV consultant Nathan Gore-Brown estimates that only about a quarter of the EV cars sold in Australia have V2L capacity.\n“I don’t think people buy it for the feature, but when they have it, they enjoy it,” he said.\n“It might be really important for some niche people.”\nThe ABC has spoken to a new EV owner, the father of a child with type 1 diabetes, who said ensuring the fridge continued to run during a power outage to keep his son’s insulin cold was a consideration when purchasing the car.\nPlaying it safe Asked about safety, Mr Panshin said the Chinese-manufactured ATTO3 came with a power board, which included an overload safety switch.\nHe said he was careful not to overload the power board with too many appliances at the same time.\nThey did without hot water and air conditioning during their two days of power outages.\nEV FireSafe, an Australian research company funded by the Defence Department, notes on its website that “EV battery fires are rare”, typically occurring after a big road traffic crash or a battery manufacturing fault.\nBetween 2010 and December 2023, the EV FireSafe research team found 434 verified passenger electric car battery fires worldwide with an estimated 26 million electric cars on the road.\nThe website suggests that based on available evidence, electric vehicles are less likely to catch fire than petrol or diesel cars, but pose new challenges for emergency responders, particularly firefighters, when they do occur.\nEV FireSafe director Emma Sutcliffe said EV battery fires usually required more time, water, and responders to manage the incident, and additional care should be taken in the removal and storage of burnt EVs.",
