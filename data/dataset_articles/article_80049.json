  "text": "Recently, BlackRock, a pioneer in asset management services, revealed that it has received a whopping $100,000 of funding from an unknown investor. The US firm disclosed this info in a fresh application sent to the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC). While Blackrock has nailed another significant mark, InQubeta, a new player in the blockchain niche, is expected to touch yet another benchmark. With the current growth ratio, the tech company will raise $10M soon. BlackRock Revives Investor Hope The world’s biggest asset management company received significant funding for its spot Bitcoin ETF back in October 2023. as reported by the SEC. The SEC stated that the investor agreed to buy 4000 shares worth roughly $100,000 in October 2023. In this case, the investor is acting as a “Statutory underwriter” in reference to the Seed Creation Baskets. The filing also revealed that the investor is looking forward to paying the sponsor’s fee, which will enable BlackRock to borrow Bitcoin as a trade credit from credit lenders. This is a new hope for Bitcoin and all the fans it has all over the world and pushes the idea that a bullish run is indeed on the way in 2024. Using this technique, BlackRock can charge the fees using loans instead of selling Bitcoin, resulting in no impact on the actual BTC rate. InQubeta: A New Wave In AI Investing [InQubeta](https://qube.la/fbd117) stands out as the best crypto platform for AI startup investments, offering an innovative approach to crypto crowdfunding. It introduces the concept of fractional investment using its native cryptocurrency, QUBE tokens, making it the best crypto to buy for those interested in the AI tech sector. Investors in InQubeta can purchase fractions of AI startup assets, eliminating the need to buy entire shares. This fractionalization makes AI startup investments more accessible to a broader audience, making it one of the best crypto to invest in now. QUBE, the deflationary ERC20 token, serves as the main medium of exchange on this platform. Holding these QUBE tokens comes with some awesome benefits. A portion of transaction fees, both for buying and selling QUBE tokens, is allocated to a burn wallet, reducing the total supply over time, making it one of the best coins to invest in. Additionally, QUBE tokens are used for staking, allowing holders to earn rewards. As you can see, the team has checked a whole lot of useful boxes when creating this token. Conclusion BlackRock was among the first in line who filed for the spot Bitcoin ETF in July. Back in the day, BlackRock was among the list of 13 awaiting decisions from the SEC. SEC has previously rejected the idea of a spot BTC ETF. The move led to many turning their attention to cryptocurrency, and as a result, the crypto world has seen a new change. Talking about the new changes, AI Crypto InQubeta is about to hit the presale mark of $10M. The AI giant is transforming the blockchain world, allowing for smart transactions, secure investments, and solid turnover.",
