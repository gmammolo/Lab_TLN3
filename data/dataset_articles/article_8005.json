  "text": "Holt residents team up and clean up after storm hits, leaving trees and debris “We take care of our family, our neighbors are our family.” HOLT, Mich. (WILX) - The heavy rain, high winds, and hail on Thursday left behind a trail of damage. Delhi Township is one of the worst-hit areas. Neighbors came together to clean up when the sun finally came out. “We take care of our family, our neighbors are our family. We know that there’s a lot of traffic coming through here, we try not to displace people longer than they have to,” said Gregory Golden, a Holt resident. The storm brought down power lines and trees and destroyed property. “Streets were flooded, branches and debris everywhere. So, I finally made it home and went to let my dogs out, and as I was about to slide the door open I noticed my entire fence was flat on the ground,” said Jodi Roberto Hancock, a Holt resident. When the storm finally passed, it brought the sunshine and people didn’t waste any time getting outside to clean up the mess. “I grew up on this street, I moved in here in 1970 so a lot of these neighbors I’ve known most of my life, these gentlemen are new but we always do this,” said Golden. He and 2 neighbors he had never met before did their part to move a large tree from the middle of the street so people could get to their homes. People have reported their power and cable outages and called their insurance companies but are still grateful the storm wasn’t any worse. “I didn’t know where exactly it was hitting and you know, sometimes you just miss it but in this case, it got us,” said Roberto Hancock. - Stay at least 25 feet away from downed power lines, and to report unguarded downed lines by calling 9-1-1 and Consumers Energy at 800-477-5050. Consumers Energy reminds people that falsely calling in downed lines actually slows down the restoration process for everyone. - Consumers Energy will trim or remove trees interfering with electric restoration activities. Once safe to do so, clean-up of debris from tree trimming or removal during a storm emergency is the responsibility of individual property owners.
