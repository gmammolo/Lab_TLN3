  "text": "Biofilms—structured communities of microorganisms that create a protective matrix shielding them from external threats, including antibiotics—are [responsible for about 80% of human infections](https://www.cell.com/trends/biotechnology/fulltext/S0167-7799(23)00295-0) and present a significant challenge in medical treatments, often resisting conventional methods. In a Q&A with Penn Today, [Hyun (Michel) Koo](https://www.dental.upenn.edu/faculty/hyun-michel-koo/) of the [School of Dental Medicine](https://www.dental.upenn.edu/) and [Edward Steager](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/people/edward-steager/) of the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/) at Penn discuss an innovative approach they’ve partnered on: the use of small-scale robotics, microrobots, to offer a promising solution to tackle these persistent infections, bringing new capabilities and precision to the field of biomedical engineering. Hyun (Michel) Koo is a professor in the Department of Orthodontics and in the divisions of Pediatric Dentistry and Community Oral Health and the co-founder of the Center for Innovation & Precision Dentistry in the School of Dental Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Edward Steager is a senior research investigator in Penn’s School of Engineering and Applied Science.",
