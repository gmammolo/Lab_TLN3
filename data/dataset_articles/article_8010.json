  "text": "Mirage News Mirage News Mirage News Politics 21 Jun 2024 2:13 pm AEST Date Time Share Launceston Transformed by New Pipeline Game Changer Michael Ferguson, Treasurer A significant milestone in improving the quality of Launceston's biggest waterway has been reached, with completion of a new underground pipeline that will help preserve the Kanamaluka/Tamar Estuary for generations to come.\nFunded by all levels of government, and delivered as part of the $140.7 million Tamar Estuary River Health Action Plan (TERHAP), the three kilometre pipeline will increase TasWater's ability to manage Launceston's combined sewage and stormwater system.\nTERHAP is a key initiative of the $603 million Launceston City Deal, with $49 million from the Australian Government, $42.5 million from the Tasmanian Government, $33.2 million from TasWater, and $11 million from the City of Launceston.\nThe one-meter wide pipeline, which has been installed 40 metres under the estuary riverbed, will redirect sewage and stormwater flows to the Ti Tree Bend Sewage Treatment Plant.\nIt is part of a comprehensive set of sewage infrastructure improvements due for completion in late 2024, including projects at the Margaret Street Pump Station, Ti Tree Band Sewage Treatment Plant, and St John Street Sewage Pump Station.\nThis upgraded sewage and stormwater system will reduce untreated overflows into Kanamaluka / Tamar Estuary – supporting future activation of this much-loved waterway.\nQuotes attributable to Minister for Regional Development and Local Government, the Hon Kristy McBain MP:\n\"It's fantastic to see work progressing on the Tamar Estuary River Health Action Plan, with the completion of this pipeline part of our ongoing commitment to improve the health of the Kanamaluka/Tamar Estuary.\n\"Having visted the estuary last year, I know that our investment will support it becoming a commercial and recreational waterway – boosting employment and economic opportunities in Launceston.\"\nQuotes attributable to Senator for Tasmania, Helen Polley:\n\"Completion of this three kilometre pipeline is first-hand proof that the Australian Government's investment in the Tamar Estuary River Health Action Plan is improving the management of Launceston's sewage and stormwater system, and the health of this important waterway.\n\"This is one of many projects we're investing in as part of our commitment to ensure that as the Launceston region grows, critical infrastructure keeps pace with the needs of the community.\"\nQuotes attributable to Tasmanian Minister for Infrastructure, Michael Ferguson:\n\"I congratulate TasWater on this milestone in the ongoing delivery of this project, which will be a game changer for Launceston.\n\"In the near future, Tasmanians will be able to gaze across the water in Launceston and know this pipeline is there, quietly doing its job to protect our waterway.\n\"I'm especially pleased that the principal contractor, Pipeline Drillers Group, is working alongside 18 local businesses engaged to work on this pipeline including Gradco, Poly Welding Solutions, Clennetts Hire, Paneltec, MJ Cook Agricultural Supplies, Phieffer Cranes, Tasmanian Tree Care, and Tasman Geotechnics.\n\"Together, they have enabled Tasmania to achieve success in this remarkable project.\"\nQuotes attributable to City of Launceston Deputy Mayor, Hugh McKenzie:\n\"The estuary is incredibly important to our community, and the City of Launceston is proud to support the Tamar Estuary River Health Action Plan with a funding commitment of $11 million.\n\"This is one of the largest infrastructure projects of its type in the southern hemisphere, and once completed the pipeline will significantly improve the overall health of the waterway by reducing the frequency and volume of overflow events.\n\"We congratulate TasWater for the extensive work that's been done to reach this important milestone, in what will prove to be a transformative project for our city's combined sewer and stormwater network.\"\n/Public Release.

Well, unlike many news organisations, we have no sponsors, no corporate or ideological interests. We don't put up a paywall – we believe in free access to information of public interest.\nMedia ownership in Australia is one of the most concentrated in the world ( Learn more ). Since the trend of consolidation is and has historically been upward, fewer and fewer individuals or organizations control increasing shares of the mass media in our country. According to independent assessment, about 98% of the media sector is held by three conglomerates. This tendency is not only totally unacceptable, but also to a degree frightening).
