[Gregory Pudovsky](https://mpost.io/author/gregorypud/) To improve your local-language experience, sometimes we employ an auto-translation plugin. Please note auto-translation may not be accurate, so read [original](#) article for precise information. In Brief PancakeSwap’s token burn strategy has reversed its downward trend and attracted investor interest, while InQubeta (QUBE) and Polygon (MATIC) are also gaining traction among 2024 portfolio picks. PancakeSwap’s (CAKE) downward spiral has ended following its recent token burn. Despite the bearish trend in the market, CAKE made a remarkable comeback by surging 50%. This was due to the platform’s approach to regulating token supply. The project’s proactive management of its token earned it the title of “everyone’s favorite DEX.” Investors have also set their sights on [InQubeta (QUBE)](https://qube.la/mps50) and Polygon (MATIC) for their portfolios in 2024. InQubeta is a crypto project that offers budget-friendly investments in AI (artificial intelligence) startups by minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The project aims to promote an inclusive ecosystem where many investors can thrive. Investors seeking which crypto to buy to 100x their earnings are leveraging this AI crypto’s ongoing presale. Polygon is another project drawing investors with its solid fundamentals and features. This article explores why InQubeta and Polygon are catching investors’ eyes. InQubeta (QUBE) Leverages The Influence Of Crypto and AI To Transform Investors’ Portfolios. The quest for which crypto to buy for steady gains is never-ending as traders seek projects that offer more profit and promise lasting value. [InQubeta](https://qube.la/mps50) is a project that satisfies the criteria of investors who want to participate in advancing the crypto space. This AI crypto rivals other vital players in the market because of its unique features. The project improves traditional investment methods, and by offering access to previously inaccessible investments like the startup sector, QUBE will become one of the top crypto coins in 2024. InQubeta’s approach to helping AI startups raise funds quickly is what has caught the eye of savvy investors. InQubeta’s popular NFT introduces a new era of funding for AI startups. This NFT marketplace offers new AI projects a place where they can mint opportunities into factionalized NFTs for investors to choose from. This helps startups raise funds and allows for budget-friendly investments. It aims to promote the global growth of AI technology and has caught the attention of traders looking for top crypto coins to expand their holdings. InQubeta’s noteworthy features have led to the ongoing presale witnessing a surge in demand. The project has raised over $7.9 million in stage six of its ICO. The presale demonstrates investors’ interest in the project, as over 702 million QUBE tokens have been sold. Potential investors can leverage the presale before the price upticks to benefit from the platform’s bonuses and appreciation. For investors seeking rich investment opportunities in the AI and crypto sectors, InQubeta is a promising option. Polygon (MATIC) Turns The Tides With Its Bullish Performance And Price Rally Despite the bearish trends, Polygon’s value has reached an all-time high (ATH) following its impressive price rally. The project has maintained a steep ascending trend for years but has shown potential to beat key resistance. MATIC is poised for new heights, and investors closely monitor its performance. Towards the end of 2023, American billionaire Mark Cuban offloaded some Polygon tokens to Coinbase. He did this during MATIC’s price rally despite the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against MATIC and other assets as unregistered securities. The lawsuit affected MATIC’s price performance, but the project keeps soaring, catching the eye of investors seeking resilient assets. Conclusion PancakeSwap’s price boost has investors anticipating more wins for the project in 2024. InQubeta and Polygon have caught investors’ eyes with their impressive performances, and they are being called the top crypto investments to leverage in 2024.
