  "text": "2024-01-05 21:29:57\nWith the arrival of AI, Apple will have to find solutions to increase the capacity of its batteries. Indeed, AI will be energy-intensive.\nIn the race for innovation, Apple could well take a big step forward with a revolutionary new battery. THE\nlatest information suggest that Apple supplier TDK Corp is actively working on a battery that could provide up to 40% more battery life for future iPhones.\nTDK Corp, Apple’s designated supplier, aims to meet the growing demands imposed by the era of AI and ubiquitous connectivity. According to Noboru Saito, general manager of TDK, technology is evolving to meet the needs of an increasingly connected world.\nAn “L” shaped battery\nBattery life has long been a point of criticism among iPhone users. As the competition advances in endurance and fast charging, Apple seeks to overcome these challenges. To do this, Apple would work on an “L” shaped battery.\nThis “L” shaped battery of the iPhone 16 Pro suggests a new design promising improved endurance. These innovations also raise the possibility that Apple itself will produce its own iPhone batteries starting in 2026.\nIt is obvious that technological players need to find solutions to integrate AI in an intelligent and functional way. Indeed, it is important that users can benefit from this integration of AI with autonomy that holds up.\n_\nFollow Belgium-iphone on\nYoutube et\nReceive our latest news directly on your WhatsApp by subscribing to\nour channel.\n1704496450\n#arrival #good #news #iPhone #autonomy",
