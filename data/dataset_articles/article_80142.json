  "text": "When talking about Greta Gerwig, it is hard to know where to start. How about becoming the first solo woman director ever to [have a billion-dollar grossing movie](https://deadline.com/2023/08/barbie-billion-dollar-milestone-global-box-office-1235456009/)? How about being the director and co-writer of the [highest-grossing Warner Bros movie of all time](https://deadline.com/2023/08/box-office-barbie-warner-bros-record-1235520568/)? How about having [the No. 1 movie of 2023](https://deadline.com/2023/08/box-office-barbie-2023-record-1235525302/)? How about being Oscar-nominated for Best Director and Screenplay for her first solo directorial achievement on Ladybird? RELATED: [‘Barbie’ Director Greta Gerwig On Ryan Gosling Wanting To Fight Mink Coat In “I’m Just Ken” Musical Number](https://deadline.com/2023/12/barbie-greta-gerwig-ryan-gosling-fight-mink-coat-im-just-ken-musical-number-1235671066/) Or following it up with Little Women and gaining another writing nomination in addition to her second consecutive film to be nominated for Best Picture? Not bad, right? And now we can rest assured that with Barbie she is probably headed for a third consecutive movie she has directed that will also grab a Best Picture nomination. RELATED: [‘Barbie’ Director Greta Gerwig Plays Coy To Potential Ken Movie Spinoff](https://deadline.com/2023/12/barbie-sequel-greta-gerwig-ken-movie-spinoff-1235653989/) And how about Meryl Streep last night saying her movie has done nothing less than save the industry and Streep’s jobs in future movies? This is all a stunning achievement for Gerwig, who until a few years ago was best known as an actress, and then added screenwriter and now is a highly bankable filmmaker studios are lining up to work with. Gerwig joins me for this week’s edition of my Deadline video series Behind the Lens to talk not just about the phenomenal year she has been having but also how she creatively pulled it all off. We discuss her cinematic inspirations along the way, how she wrote Ken for Ryan Gosling without ever having met him and then hoping he would just say yes, her collaboration with husband Noah Baumbach, the importance of the music to Barbie and so much more.

It has also been named one of AFI Awards Best Films of the Year and has received significant traction in the Oscar shortlists and BAFTA longlists.
