The patient, a 52-year-old man suffering from end-stage liver disease, underwent a 12-hour surgery on December 4 last year. The donor, in this case, was the patient's wife, who willingly contributed a portion of her liver to save her husband's life. Both the donor and recipient have been recovering well, with the patient not requiring ventilator support post-surgery.
