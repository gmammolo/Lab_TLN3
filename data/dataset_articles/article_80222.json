  "text": "Forever 21's collaboration with Netflix on a limited-edition fashion collection, the Forever 21 x Rebel Moon, merges cinematic aesthetics with high-street fashion. The garments in the capsule are based on Zack Snyder's sci-fantasy film 'Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire.'\nThe Forever 21 x Rebel Moon collection consists of 18 unique pieces and includes cotton tees, knit tops, fleece athletic bottoms, sweatshirts/hoodies, dresses, and a bomber-style jacket. Inspired by the film characters and on-screen wardrobes, the designs showcase utilitarian features with a nod to current fashion trends and the film's aesthetic. The fabrics, including heavyweight cotton French terry for knits and weather-resistant nylon for outerwear, reflect a deliberate choice to capture the otherworldly and combat themes of 'Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire,' while also remaining durable and versatile for everyday use.\nImage Credit: Forever 21\nForever 21 and Netflix Draw Inspiration from Rebel Moon\nReferences:\nurban-planet\nTrend Themes\n1.
