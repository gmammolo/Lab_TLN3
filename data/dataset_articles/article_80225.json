  "text": "Study reveals which day of the year will lead you to wealth and richesThere are 500 top billionaires in the world, and 19 share this birthdayREAD MORE: Find out how the top billionaires think\nBecoming a billionaire might be just a pipe dream for many who believe you have to be born into wealth, but a new study reveals it could come down to your birthdate.\nThe U.S. hosts most of the world’s billionaires, with 189 people residing within its borders, while China is the runner-up, with just 53 living in the country.\nNew research has revealed that 19 of the roughly 500 top billionaires worldwide have one thing in common – they were born on November 30.\nThese wealthy and successful individuals include publishing tycoons, manufacturing masters and film producers.\nBecoming a billionaire might be just a pipe dream for many who believe you have to be born into wealt , but a new study reveals it could come down to your birthdate\nNew research reveals that 19 of the roughly 500 top billionaires worldwide have one thing in common – they were born on November 30\nFinance experts at Coupon Follow looked at data from Bloomberg’s Top 500 billionaires list.\nThey researched each person’s industry and date of birth to narrow down the commonalities that may have contributed to their success.\nThe company discerned that this date was the most popular, saying it ‘is miles ahead of the other birth dates.’\nBut if you’re concerned that you just missed the cutoff, Coupon Follow says not to worry because October was likewise found to be the most popular birth month for billionaires.\n‘If you’re worried that you might not get this exact date for your future child, then you’re in luck,’ Coupon Follow said in its press release, adding that 45 out of 500 billionaires are born in October.\nAdvance Publications owner Donald Newhouse ranked 115 out of the 500 wealthiest billionaires but is in the top spot for those born on Nov. 30, with a net worth of $15.8 billion.\nGoh Cheng Liang founded the paint and coatings manufacturer Wuthelam Holdings in Singapore – he ranked 183 overall but is in the second spot for the most popular birthday and has a net worth of $11.1 billion.\nGoh Cheng Liang (left) founded the paint and coatings manufacturer Wuthelam Holdings in Singapore has a net worth of $11.1 billion. Advance Publications owner Donald Newhouse (right) has a net worth of $15.8 billion\nUS film producer Diane Hendricks (left) has a net worth of $10.4 billion. Gong Hongjia (right), the vice-chairman for the security equipment supplier Hikvision in China has a net worth of $10.8 billion\nThe third and fourth slots are held by Gong Hongjia, the vice-chairman for the security equipment supplier Hikvision in China, and U.S. film producer Diane Hendricks, each with a $10.8 and $10.4 billion net worth, respectively.\nCoupon Follow reported that Jan. 1 was the only date that came close, with 13 billionaires being born that day, but every other date listed revealed that only between two and four billionaires shared that birthday.\nThis information comes less than a week into 2024, following a Statista survey that found that more than half of people between 18 and 64 prioritized saving more money for their New Year’s resolution.\nAlthough this may seem like a lofty goal, a separate Forbes Health survey found that the average New Year’s resolution lasts just 3.74 months, with only one percent of people sticking with it for the full calendar year.\nThis year might be the perfect opportunity to test Coupon Follows findings and see if those October and Nov. 30 babies will fall into the one percent.",
