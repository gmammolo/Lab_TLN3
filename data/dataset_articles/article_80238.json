Here’s how to access it very quickly on iPhone or iPad.\nThis will also interest you\nOn both the iPhone and the iPad, it is possible to create a bookmark, or shortcut, to a web page. This bookmark will be placed on the home screen and it will therefore be possible to access the page in question directly. Here are the steps to follow.\nLoad webpage from Safari\nIt is first necessary to load the desired web page from the Safari browser.\nShare page\nClick on the “Share” icon. A menu appears on the screen. Scroll through the options until you see “On Home Screen”. Select it. You can change the shortcut text if you want. Finally, select “Add”.\nTesting the shortcut\nThe web page icon appears on the home page and as you can see it is a custom icon. All that remains is to test that this bookmark (shortcut) works as expected.\nYou can also move the bookmark to the desired panel on the Home screen by holding your finger on the corresponding icon until “–” appears, then moving it to the desired panel.\n1704498750\n#create #bookmark #iPhone #iPad",
