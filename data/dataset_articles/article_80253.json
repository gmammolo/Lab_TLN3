  "text": "[Castingshadows](/community/members/castingshadows.26290853/)\nWell-known member\n- Apr 14, 2020\n- 3,061\n- 2,665\nI have a large collection of high quality sandalwood oils and I’ve had this itch for years to start making my own blends according to my own personal taste. With this experiment I wanted to take my sinking grade Indonesian Sandalwood roots distillation that already showcased warm, boozy amber notes with rich, spicy, woodsy qualities and expand on the vertical and horizontal scent spectrum. In other words I wanted to enrich the top notes and extend the basenotes. I didn’t want to change the inherent nature of the sandalwood but rather create an interesting base I can use in other blends.\nOkay so heres the materials I used:\nFraterworks Epice FW\nFraterworks Absolute Ambergris\nFraterworks Labdanum Absolute (dark)\nFraterworks Olibanum Couer MD\nFraterworks Ambre Royale\nHeres my approach (all materials undiluted except labdanum which is 50%):\n2 grams of sandalwood\n1 tiny drop absolute ambergris\n5 tiny drops labdanum\n3 tiny drops Olibanum\n5 drops Ambre Royale\nTiny plastic toothpick dipped in Epice\nObviously this is completely rudimentary and not scientific nor professional in any capacity and I know I broke tons of perfumery rules by not weighing anything, prediluting materials, or using tiny amounts for experimenting. I got excited and didn’t want to wait for my equipment to get here so I used some pipettes I had laying around and eyeballed everything.\nWhat surprised me the most was Epice FW. This material has such a gorgeous, soapy, vintage quality that brings out old stock Mysore vibes in the Sandalwood. It ever so gently creates a spicy floral note I didn’t expect to happen. I barely used any here yet it helped to create beautiful lift in the opening along with the gentle citric qualities present. The booze also takes on a slight egg nog aroma in that it’s boozy but spiced. The florals are gorgeous here and I’m actually surprised at how much they feel like they were always a part of the oil.\nThe other materials aren’t as present but they are felt in texture and performance. The amber notes literally round out the base of the oil and makes the material feel huge as if it’s a perfume in its own right while still smelling like Sandalwood. The sweetness only helps to expand on the amber notes already present. I need to use more labdanum and olibanum though as I can safely say now these materials will synergistically enhance the aroma.\nThe performance more than anything caught me off guard. This has solid projection which is way stronger than I thought it would be so that’s a huge plus especially for fixative properties.\nI have some dreamwood I want to add in order to bring out some dry, woody qualities to balance the boozy warmth. I’m not sure where to start with that because I’m pretty sure it’ll need precision and dilution as I really don’t want to overdose so I’ll wait for my scale and glass to get here before I do.\nMost of all I just had fun. It feels great to wear this on my skin and the wheels are already turning on how to use this base material for a spicy pineapple mulkullat I’ve always wanted to make.\nOkay so heres the materials I used:\nFraterworks Epice FW\nFraterworks Absolute Ambergris\nFraterworks Labdanum Absolute (dark)\nFraterworks Olibanum Couer MD\nFraterworks Ambre Royale\nHeres my approach (all materials undiluted except labdanum which is 50%):\n2 grams of sandalwood\n1 tiny drop absolute ambergris\n5 tiny drops labdanum\n3 tiny drops Olibanum\n5 drops Ambre Royale\nTiny plastic toothpick dipped in Epice\nObviously this is completely rudimentary and not scientific nor professional in any capacity and I know I broke tons of perfumery rules by not weighing anything, prediluting materials, or using tiny amounts for experimenting.
