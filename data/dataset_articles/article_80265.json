  "text": "Some of us are rigidly anti-Apple. Maybe it’s their strong-arming the population into buying different headphones, or maybe you hated what Steve Jobs did for black turtlenecks. Either way: Microsoft is a popular competitor in the computer and tablet space, with its Microsoft Surface devices competing with iPads and MacBooks at every price point. Microsoft’s Surface Laptop Go, the company’s alternative to the MacBook Air, is at its lowest price ever on Amazon today, [down from $900 to just $619](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GZJM87M?tag=spycom00-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&language=en_US&asc_source=web&asc_campaign=web&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fspy.com%2Farticles%2Fgadgets%2Felectronics%2Fmicrosoft-surface-laptop-go-sale-1203000530%2F). The Surface’s calling card has always been that it’s a convertible and flips from a computer to a tablet with a flick of the wrist, something the iPad can’t do. However, the Surface Go is a straightforward laptop, perfect for those who want a slim device like the MacBook Air without actually having a MacBook Air. The Go is 2.44 pounds, lighter than the latest edition of the MacBook Air, and has a 12.4” PixelSense touchscreen display and a Fingerprint Power Button as an added security step. It has an impressive 250-gigabyte hard drive with 8 gigabytes of RAM and lasts nine hours on a single charge. Reviewers note that while the quality of the graphics and hardware make this a high-value purchase, the battery life is disappointing compared to the 10-12 hours of life with the MacBook Air.",
