  "text": "Entertainment of Friday, 21 June 2024 Source: [www.ghanaweb.com](/GhanaHomePage/aboutus.php) Archbishop Kofi Adonteng Boateng, a Ghanaian-American theologian, preacher, and philanthropist, has broken his silence about his life's mission and the heroic act of rescuing a boy from a fire in the USA. Reflecting on the incident, the General Overseer of Divine Word International Ministries expressed his fulfillment in making a difference, stating, \"This is what life is worth living for: to make a difference, to change a life. I am happy at that moment. The Lord chose me to be there to rescue the boy and to make a difference for the family.\" Upon his arrival in Ghana at Kotoka International Airport on June 20, 2024, the archbishop also addressed the differences in recognition between the US and Ghana. According to him, while he is celebrated as a National Hero in the US for his good works, in Ghana, recognition often depends on one's political or financial status. He called for broader acknowledgment of everyday heroes in Ghana, saying, \"I feel that every day, people in Ghana go through things, people do things that the nation should acknowledge and recognize them for the heroic work they do every day.\" As Ghana approaches its elections, he advised pastors to refrain from deep political involvement, emphasizing the detrimental effects of such actions on their congregations. He urged the youth to vote with their conscience rather than accept bribes. \"The leaders that are coming are not coming because of their wealth or intelligence; they are coming because they have money to pay the people and to lead them,\" he warned. Archbishop Boateng's arrival at the airport in Accra was greeted with excitement by Rev. Obaapa Christy, the Rock Ladies, and admiration from the gathered crowd.",
