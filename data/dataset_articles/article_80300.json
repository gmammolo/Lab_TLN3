(KFYR) - Your watch might tell you you need to hit 10,000 steps a day, but researchers from the Pacific Neuroscience Institute Brain Health Center say getting even 4,000 steps can have benefits for brain health. They say this is especially true for those at risk of developing Alzheimer’s. They say exercising regularly – even if it’s just a small amount – can help people maintain their brain health. Rebecca Woolsey, a psychiatric nurse practitioner at CHI’s Archway Mental Health Services, said while exercise won’t cure Alzheimer’s, it’s likely one of the best preventative measures you can take. “When we’re treating dementia, there really aren’t good meds. So I think it becomes a little more important when we say, ‘Hey, look, this is our best shot,’ because it’s something that, really, we don’t have good treatments for,” Woolsey said. Woolsey said if walking doesn’t appeal to you, gardening, dancing and other forms of activity are beneficial as well. Copyright 2024 KFYR. All rights reserved.",
