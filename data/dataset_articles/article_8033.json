  "text": "[Lubbock, Texas](https://www.everythinglubbock.com/news/local-news/roswell-man-uses-his-event-business-to-help-those-fire-victims/)— A Roswell man, Sergio Jimenez, tells EverythingLubbock.com that when he saw the news of the fires that began Monday, he started to see many people come into his city of Roswell, and he knew he had to do something to help. Jimenez said he did not know what to expect when he opened his doors to his event center, Encanto. “When I say 23 families, they were anywhere from families that had four people to families that had nine people,” Jimenez said. “We really didn’t have a process; it’s just that we went with it; we became a shelter, receiving center, a distribution center, a delivery place, a meal dining area, a kitchen. It became all in one. Not intentionally. But it all worked out.” Jimenez explained that the Roswell community, was quick to respond to helping their neighboring city of Ruidoso with multiple donations of water, clothes, blankets and food getting dropped off constantly. Jimenez said, “We haven’t had the need to call the National Guard to say, hey, we need supplies because the communities are supporting us with stuff. So at this point, like we get tons of stuff and as tons of stuff come in, tons of stuff goes out.” Volunteer firefighter Salvador Zambrano said that although he is not on the front lines yet, it is his job to let people know that resources like Encanto are available. “I met a dad the other day at two in the morning in the Walmart parking lot with his four kids, and it was like, man, I watched my house burn down and there was nothing I could do to stop it,” Zambrano said. “He said he grabbed his kids and he just left. It’s not like they will have a house in a week or two…This is a whole that’s going to go on for months, years, maybe.”",
