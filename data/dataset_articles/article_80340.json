  "text": "2024-01-06 00:03:43\nAstuce: l’extension Chrome/Edge\nSimple Price Alerts (lien) allows you to be alerted immediately of a price drop on Amazon, AliExpress, Banggood, eBay, Geekbuying, Rakuten, etc.\nDeveloped by iScooter, the i9 Pro electric scooter stands out for its power of 350 watts, propelling the device to a maximum speed of 30 km/h. Its 36V and 7.5Ah battery ensures a travel capacity of 25 km, ideal for everyday travel. Additionally, the recharge time is only 4-5 hours.\nSafety is a major feature of this scooter. Equipped with 8.5-inch Honeycomb tires, offering impeccable handling. For night driving, the LED front headlight and rear light guarantee optimal visibility. The braking system, consisting of a disc brake and an e-ABS brake, allows for quick and safe stopping.\nThe i9 Pro also stands out for its connected features. It can be controlled via a mobile application. Suitable for riders up to 120 kg and measuring between 140 and 200 cm, this scooter is suitable for many users. The scooter is easily transportable thanks to its weight of 13.5 kg and its ability to fold.\nA deal at 246.63 euros on the Banggood site\nGood news, the iScooter i9 Pro electric scooter is currently at its lowest price at Banggood via a coupon. This promo code allows you to reduce its price to 246.63 euros (excluding optional shipping guarantee). Additionally, using the “EU Priority Shipping” delivery method, shipping costs are free.\nThis discount is available by going to\nthis page. On the validation page of your purchase, you enter the following promo code in the associated field: BGISCI9PRO. To be able to apply this promo code, you must be connected to your Banggood customer account (free). To guarantee the purchase, on the good receipt on time of the product but also the good quality of it, you have the possibility of payment with PayPal. You will have to be careful because this promo code has a limited number of applications among all Banggood customers.\nThe Banggood e-commerce site\nThe specialized e-commerce site Banggood is becoming more and more popular. The explanation is simple: this merchant for the whole world offers high-end objects, from mobile devices to quadcopters and connected objects, at prices generally less expensive than those offered by the traditional commercial behemoths on Internet.\nWe are well aware of the well-established giants here: Amazon and eBay, the French Cdiscount as well as Rakuten (formerly Price-Minister). Banggood is an e-commerce site targeting the whole world whose borderless expansion is fully assumed. As proof, the prices presented change slightly from one day to the next. This is the consequence of the fluctuation in the exchange rate between the euro that a European Internet user will see and the dollar used for reference.\n1704500033\n#reduction #coupon #missed #treat #iScooter #Pro #electric #scooter #kmh",
