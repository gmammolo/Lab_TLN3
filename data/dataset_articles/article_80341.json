  "text": "Huckberry is no stranger to remarkable watch collaborations. This past year, they partnered with the likes of Zodiac on a titanium Super Sea Wolf Skin Diver and helped Timex reissue its late-’90s Ironman Flix\ndigital watch. Well, the online retailer is back at it again with Timex, with a simple yet stunning field watch in titanium.\nOne of our favorite aspects of field watches in general is how remarkable they can be without drawing much attention to themselves. For this Huckberry x Timex Titanium Field Watch, the beauty is truly in the details: the bead-blasted\ntitanium case that’s incredibly lightweight on your wrist, the high visibility thanks to clear hour markers and C3 Swiss SuperLuminova on the hands and indices, and the interchangeable #tide ocean nylon straps in blue and olive green. Inspired by the Northern Lights, the blue-colored lume provides a beautiful contrast against the matte white dial, even when it’s not in low light. And then there are the technical specs. With 200m of water resistance, this shock-resistant timepiece can go just about anywhere, and despite the 41mm case size, the timepiece should wear much smaller due to the case material and the 12.5mm height.\nOn the inside, the simple time and date functions are powered by a Japanese-made automatic movement with 44 hours of power reserve. The mechanism can be viewed through the exhibition caseback, which features the logos of both Huckberry and Timex, with the movement’s custom rotor engraved with\nTimex’s wordmark. Likewise, Huckberry’s logo can also be seen on the screw-down crown.\nPerhaps the most notable part about all of Timex’s watches is how affordable they are without losing anything in the way of performance. This Huckberry x Timex Titanium Automatic Field Watch is priced at $375 and can be purchased now from Huckberry’s web store.",
