  "text": "Xcel Energy improving Harrington Generating Station’s fuel transformation with new gas pipeline investment AMARILLO, Texas (KFDA) - Xcel Energy’s 2020-initiated project to convert a coal-fueled station to natural gas is gaining momentum with the acquisition of the new pipeline. The several mile long pipeline will be located near Lakeside Drive in Potter County. This move not only improves air quality for the county, but also positions Xcel for cost-efficient and environmental friendly operations. “Natural gas does not emit the same level of sulfur dioxide than a coal plant would,” said Wes Reeves, Xcel Energy senior media relations representative. Reeves said Xcel is hopeful to have the access they need and begin construction of the pipeline by the end of the first quarter. “So we’re in the process right now of finishing up the land access and land acquisition for that pipeline project that could be about a 20 mile pipeline,” said Reeves. The roughly $75 million project is set to be completed by January 2025. Copyright 2024 KFDA. All rights reserved.",
