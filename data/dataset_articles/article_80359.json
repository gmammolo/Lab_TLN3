However, we’re here to save you the hassle and assist you in any way possible! So, before purchasing a unit, make sure to take the following into consideration!\n- Thermostat\nA thermostat is a component which senses the temperature of a physical system and performs actions. As a result, the system is able to maintain the temperature at the ideal setpoint.\nThe thermostat on an air conditioner allows you to control the cooling output. In fact, middle to higher-end models will feature a digital thermostat. The thermostat shows both the selected temperature as well as the actual temperature.\n- Adjustable fan speed\nAdjusting the fan speed affects the rate at which you can cool down your space. Usually, you can select from two or three fan speeds. Note that the speed level also affects the level of noise the unit makes.\nIf you’re using air conditioner in a bedroom, then this feature is nice as you can select a lower, quieter, fan speed at night.\n- Remote control\nA remote control lets you operate the AC without having to use the controls mounted to the front. Standard remotes let you control and adjust the temperature and fan speed. Meanwhile, some have a temperature display on the remote control. It also comes in handy and proves convenient at the worst of times.\n- Type of filter\nStandard filters are the most common filter type. It is a basic filter and you will have to place it periodically to ensure proper air flow and filtration.\nMeanwhile, you can just clean washable filters in a sink to avoid having to buy a replacement. They are also commendably durable and can withstand several washes.\n- Energy Star Rating\nUnits with an Energy Star rating can operate up to 15% more efficiently than units that are not certified. Depending on how often you plan to utilize your window unit, energy efficiency may be something you want to consider.\n- BTUs\nBTUs are the traditional measurement unit of heat. In the air conditioning world, BTU is a measurement of the cooling capacity of your window air conditioner. The bigger the number of BTUs, the more powerful and higher cooling capacity will be of your A/C unit.\nAs a standard measurement, an air conditioner needs around thirty BTU for each square foot of living space that you wish to cool.\nConclusion\nAir conditioners have become a mandatory purchase for us, and it comes as no surprise that the market for this product is on fire, especially in the summers we’re facing right now.\nThey serve a great purpose in making life a little bit easy and help to breathe better. It makes the entire difference between a welcoming and scorchingly hot home.\nAll in all, air conditioners are a necessity that one cannot resist. Our favorite of the lot is the Pioneer Air Conditioner Ductless Wall Mount Mini Split since it is highly efficient. Moreover, its remote control and other convenient features add to the ease of use.
