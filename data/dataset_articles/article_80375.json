  "text": "Early mobility has been proven to accelerate postoperative recovery in patients, but they have not yet been widely used in postoperative glioblastoma patients. The evidence-based nursing method was used to obtain clinical practice evidence. A standardized nursing care process for patients after surgery was developed which corresponds to different early mobilization plans for patients with different muscle strength and at different postoperative times. This plan Firstly, standardized training and examination were provided to department nurses (n = 48). Then the experimental group (n = 59) was subjected to the early mobilization rehabilitation nursing program plus routine nursing care, whereas the observation (n = 56) received only routine nursing care. The nurses reported that their awareness rate and passing rate on early mobilization health education improved substantially after the training program. Significant statistical differences were found in patients’ score of ADL, the first time of getting out of bed, the time of indwelling catheter, gastric tube, the central venous catheter, hospitalization time, and postoperative complications (P < 0.05). The rehabilitation of postoperative patients with glioma cancer who used evidence-based early mobilization health education is safe and reliable after craniotomy, which promotes the recovery of patients.\nClinical trial registration: Our ethical approval has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. The ethical approval number is 2019258, and we are currently unable to provide a Clinical Trial registration number.",
