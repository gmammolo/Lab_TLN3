  "text": "The environmental issues generated by industrial advancement and human activities are serious and must not be overlooked. Bio-nanotechnology has emerged as a solution for producing biosynthetic nanomaterials to address environmental issues. The current work describes for the first time an economical and environmentally benign method of producing gold nanoparticles utilizing Grewia asiatica (GAAuNPs). The optimal AuNPs were produced using a gold ion concentration of 1 mM and a metal-to-extract ratio of 1:1. The resulting nanoparticles were analyzed and characterized using X-ray crystallography, FTIR, SEM, EDX, and UV visible spectroscopy. The catalytic methylene blue (MB) dye degradation properties, antibacterial and biofilm inhibition abilities, and antioxidant properties of the synthesized particles were investigated. The Au NPs demonstrated efficient catalytic degradation against MB and completely degraded it in 8 minutes. The NPs also exhibited potent biofilm inhibition against E. coli and S. aureus that was close to the standard and was more antioxidant than the standard. The findings highlight G. asiatica as a suitable, inexpensive biosource for biofabricating GAAuNPs with extensive multifunctional uses. To conclude, GAAuNPs' ability to degrade organic pollutants and eradicate pathogens provides a cost-effective and environmentally benign remedy to tackle contemporary pollutants.",
