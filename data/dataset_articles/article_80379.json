If you’ve been wondering\nhow to make money transcribing, then companies like Rev, Scribie, and TranscribeMe offer jobs for beginners to get started in the transcription world.

Many companies use both.\n- Rev has one of the largest catalogs of freelancers, with an average pay rate of $156 per month.\n- Audio Transcription Center and TranscribeMe both pay about $15 to $20 per audio hour, which makes them relatively high-paying options.\n- Fiverr helps freelancers of all kinds list their services for hire — including transcriptionists.\nThe 7 best transcription sites that pay\n1. Rev\nRev is a popular global transcription service that was created primarily as a remote working option, focusing on speech-to-text services. The company’s team of freelancers offers audio transcription, video captions, subtitles, and live captions for Zoom.\nIt has a network of over 72,000 freelancers that use speech recognition AI to quickly and accurately transcribe a variety of programs. However, freelancers shouldn’t rely on Rev to make a full-time living, as the average freelancer makes just $156 in monthly earnings.\n2. Scribie\nScribie employs a network of over 50,000 freelancers. The company provides a remote work option and helpful AI tools to make transcribing each audio clip as easy as possible.\nOn average, Scribie freelancers make $5 to $20 per audio hour. How much you earn depends on your skill level and how many scripts you get through. Luckily, most audio files are only about six minutes long, which makes it easy to complete many transcriptions in a short amount of time.\n3. SpeakWrite\nSpeakWrite focuses on insurance, business, and legal transcription jobs. Freelancers must meet a short list of requirements to get started, including typing 60 words per minute with very few errors. You must also provide your own equipment, and previous transcription experience is a plus.\nSince SpeakWrite promises clients three-hour turnaround times for certain work, expect to have short deadlines for your work. That said, you can choose your own schedule, and the options are flexible, as SpeakWrite operates 24/7. Typists earn one half cent per word, and some shifts offer a 10% bonus.\n4. TranscribeMe\nLike many transcription companies, TranscribeMe prioritizes remote transcription work and a flexible schedule you can design yourself. TranscribeMe offers customers AI-powered and typist-checked transcriptions and translations.\nStarting typists make anywhere from $15 to $22 per hour at TranscribeMe. Most typists don’t earn a full-time wage, averaging just $250 each month in income. For those who stick with the company, there are opportunities for advancement. Members of these special teams earn $60 to $70+ per audio hour.\n5. GoTranscript\nGoTranscript is one of the largest transcription sites in the world, offering English, Spanish, German, and French translations. The company frequently has openings on its careers page, particularly for Spanish translators.\nGoTranscript offers slightly more competitive pay, with top earners bringing in $1,215 per month. Average typists and translators don’t earn a ton, however. Freelance transcriptionists can expect to earn $150 per month on average with GoTranscript.\n6. Audio Transcription Center\nAudio Transcription Center provides transcription services for academic institutions, government agencies, historians, financial organizations, and archival organizations. The company has offered these services since 1966, making it a well-established organization. In keeping with its strong commitment to accuracy, typists must take a transcription test and type at least 80 words per minute with 98% accuracy.\nAlthough the Audio Transcription Center has a higher standard for its transcriptionists than most, its pay is actually slightly lower, running from $15 to $18 per hour. That said, beginners can start their transcribing career with Audio Transcription Center, as no prior experience is necessary to apply.\n7. Fiverr\nFiverr isn’t a transcription-specific site, but freelancers of all kinds can list their services on its platform. When Fiverr began, most services cost customers just $5, but freelancers set their own prices now.\nUnlike other companies on this list, you’re responsible for the business side of the equation as well as providing the transcription services. You must create and manage your listings and pricing and attract a regular clientele to earn consistent income.\nWhat’s required to be a transcriptionist?\nBecoming a transcriptionist is an attainable side hustle option for most people who have a computer to work from and a reliable internet connection, as well as some other skills companies look for in typists and translators.\nWhether you're aiming to dive into the world of general, medical, legal, or language transcription, the following are the fundamental requirements to excel in the field:\n- Fast typing speed and accuracy: A proficient transcriptionist must have a strong command of keyboard skills. Most companies require a minimum typing speed of 60 words per minute and a high accuracy rate.\n- Attention to detail: You should be able to maintain focus for extended periods and stay consistent in speed and accuracy to produce error-free transcripts.\n- Bilingual abilities: Many transcription companies appreciate freelancers with the ability to speak English and other languages like Spanish or French.\n- Strong grammar skills: A strong command of the language being transcribed, including its grammar, punctuation, and vocabulary, is necessary for producing accurate written content.\n- Excellent listening skills: A transcriptionist must be able to translate spoken words into written words quickly and accurately, even in cases of poor audio quality or background noise.\n- Reliable technology: A reliable computer and a high-quality headset or headphones are essential to ensure optimal audio clarity and a seamless transcription process.\n- Research abilities: Thorough research skills and the capability to fact-check are necessary, particularly when transcribing technical or specialized content such as legal or medical documents.\n- Stellar time management and organizational skills: Effective time management and organizational abilities are essential to meet deadlines and manage multiple projects simultaneously.\nHow to choose the best transcription jobs\nIf you’re considering becoming a transcriptionist, you may be surprised to see how many companies offer this as a side hustle. To narrow down the best option for your schedule and payment preferences, think through the following:\n- Consider your interests and expertise: Look for transcription opportunities that align with your interests or areas you specialize in. Areas such as legal and medical transcription can leverage your existing knowledge and skills, which may lead to more fulfilling and lucrative opportunities.\n- Look at the payment structure and rates: Most audio transcription jobs pay pennies per word, but the more assignments you can take on, the more money you can make. Compare the compensation structures, such as pay-per-audio-minute, pay-per-word, or hourly rates, to make sure you choose a service with competitive pay.\n- Consider the flexibility offered: Balancing your side hustle with other commitments is easier when you have the freedom to adjust your side-hustle schedule. Work with companies that give you full choice over when you work.\n- Read reviews: Research the reputation of transcription companies by exploring online reviews, testimonials, and feedback from other transcriptionists. Choose clients with a positive track record of timely payments and clear communication since they tend to have a more stable work environment.\n- Assess the technology requirements: Ensure that the audio transcription jobs you choose fit within your technical capabilities and equipment. Does the company require a Mac? PC? A headset? A foot pedal? Make sure you’re comfortable providing these things on your own.\nFAQs\nHow do you get into audio transcribing?\nPeople with a working computer and internet connection can enter into the audio transcribing business. It takes strong typing and listening skills, but those willing to learn can find sites willing to work with them. To get started, consider taking general transcription courses and crafting a professional resume.\nHow much do audio transcribers make?\nMost audio transcribers make anywhere from a hundred dollars to a couple of thousand dollars each month. For the most part, $15 to $25 per hour is the common pay range.\nWhat transcribing site pays the most?\nTranscribeMe’s highest-paid transcribers make $60 to $70 per hour, which is one of the higher rates in the industry. Generally, the more you transcribe and the longer you stay with a company, the higher your rates will be.\nHow long does it take to transcribe one hour of audio?\nHow long it takes to transcribe one hour of audio varies from person to person. Generally, the average transcriptionist takes four hours to transcribe an hour-long audio file. However, this timeframe can significantly increase for challenging audio with accents, technical terminology, or background noise.\nBest transcription sites that pay: bottom line\nFor certain freelancers, transcription jobs can be one of the\nbest side hustles, offering the convenience of working from home and the ability to manage your own schedule. But you should know that the earning potential in this field is often limited, especially for beginners. Despite this, getting into the industry as a novice is relatively straightforward. You just need typing skills, your own equipment, and a willingness to familiarize yourself with transcription software.\nFor experienced transcribers looking to maximize profits, TranscribeMe and GoTranscript pay a premium. Those looking for the most flexibility should consider SpeakWrite and Rev, which are entirely remote and operate 24/7. Alternatively, you can consider\nfreelance jobs for typists.\nMethodology\nThe companies we chose for our best transcription job sites may be current or past FinanceBuzz partners.
