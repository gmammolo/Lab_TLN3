  "text": "On the morning of Wednesday, June 19, state police agents saved the lives of a person and their pet who were trapped in the middle of a fire that occurred in a home in Ciudad Cancel. Until now, officially, the causes of the fire are unknown, however, it was unofficially known that the incident could have been due to a short circuit. The fire started minutes before 8 in the morning in a house located on 77-B Street between 106 and 108 of the neighborhood, in the west of Mérida. The fire spread quickly through the house so that a man and his dog were trapped inside. The neighbors, who noticed the fire, called 911 and within minutes elements of the state police arrived and broke some window panes to carry out the rescue and save the lives of the man and his pet. Minutes later, firefighters arrived and fought the fire. Paramedics also arrived and took the person into an ambulance to treat him and, although he did not suffer physical injuries, he did have mild smoke poisoning. During the work, the police closed the street to prevent vehicle traffic and thus make the work more agile. TYT Newsroom",
