Boasting a 6.78-inch AMOLED display, Dimensity 8200 processor, 256GB storage, and 120W fast charging, the smartphone competes against rivals like OnePlus Nord 3 5G and Nothing Phone (1). iQOO has officially slashed the price of the Neo7 5G ahead of the iQOO Neo9 Pro launch in India. iQOO is preparing for the launch of its next flagship, the iQOO Neo9 Pro, in February. But before that, the brand has slashed the price of the existing iQOO Neo7 5G, particularly the 12GB RAM + 256GB storage variant. With this price drop, the Neo7 becomes an even more tempting proposition in the sub-30,000 price range. But is it still the best choice? Let's dive in. Discounted Delight: Impressive Specs at a Lower Price The price cut brings the Neo7 5G down to ₹27,999, a significant drop from its original ₹31,999. For this price, you get a feature-packed phone with a stunning 6.78-inch AMOLED display, a powerful Dimensity 8200 processor, 256GB onboard storage, and a long-lasting 5,000mAh battery with 120W fast charging. The camera setup, including a 64MP primary sensor with OIS, caters to most photography needs. Future-Proof Potential with Android 14 on the Horizon The Neo7 currently runs Android 13-based Funtouch OS 13, but an upgrade to Android 14 is expected soon. iQOO has also promised two major Android updates and three years of security updates, meaning the Neo7 could potentially receive Android 15 as well. Tough Competition in the Sub-30k Battlefield The iQOO Neo7 faces stiff competition in this price segment. The OnePlus Nord 3 5G offers similar performance at a slightly lower price, while the Nothing Phone 1 boasts a unique design and impressive camera capabilities. Ultimately, the choice depends on your individual priorities. the Neo7 5G is still a strong contender in the sub-30,000 segment, especially with its attractive new price tag. However, it's crucial to weigh its strengths against the competition before making a purchase decision.
