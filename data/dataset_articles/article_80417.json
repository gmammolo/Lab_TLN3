  "text": "It's a superhero tribute build with all the unique flair that the Caped Crusader might expect.\nUnderneath the wild build you see here is a 1948 Fiat 500 Topolino; above it is the bodywork of a superhero tribute car.\nThe entire car has been customized, leaving only the roofline of the original vehicle behind. It's now a far cry from the original\nFiat 500 as the chassis has been stretched, and its rear has been reshaped to resemble a classic drag racer. It also now comes with an adjustable air ride suspension and is powered by a big block V8.\nWhile we have seen other\ncrazy Fiat builds, this tribute car takes things to a new level with its stretched fiberglass body, exposed exhaust pipes, and total disconnection from any Fiat 500 that has come before.\nThe black-and-blue theme continues on the grille and rear wing and in the pinstripe detailing along the profile. It also has LED headlights, modern alloy wheels, and a license plate bracket at the back, indicating the car might be road-legal in some states.\nAs for the interior, there is, unfortunately, only one metal bucket seat available. The custom black cabin is without any cushy padding. However, the driver gets a commanding position with racing belts, toggle switches, and a detachable steering wheel, along with Stewart Warner Maximum Performance readouts, an EFI control screen, a sunroof, and a backup camera, which is clearly imperative.\nUnder the hood, the Fiat-turned-superhero tribute car is powered by a shiny 502 cubic-inch V8 with electronic fuel injection and a supercharger that would make any classic Chevrolet Camaro owner proud. While there are no official dyno numbers for the car, the\n502 V8 crate engine generates 461 horsepower in HO form.\nAside from this, the V8 is paired with shiny custom headers and a TH400 three-speed automatic transmission. The best part is that the vehicle only has 2,600 miles on the odometer. It even has a Ford 9-inch rear, with massive tires and four-wheel disc brakes to handle all its extra power.\nIf you want to get your hands on this unique build, it is currently up for grabs on\nStreetside Classics for $55,995. The project is well-documented and comes with all the receipts, so you know what was done to the car.",
