  "text": "June 21 2024\nGMA Kapuso Foundation (GMAKF), the socio-civic arm of GMA Network, joined forces with the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) to hasten the implementation of relief operations in disaster-stricken areas. The partnership was formalized through a memorandum of Agreement (MOA) signed on June 19 at the GMA Network Center.\nThis partnership aims to ensure the swift delivery of aid to Filipinos in need through the assistance of DILG units, including the Philippine National Police (PNP), Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), and local barangay units. It also underscores the shared commitment of GMAKF and DILG to provide prompt and efficient public service to disadvantaged and underserved communities across the country.\nSigning the MOA were GMAKF Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Rikki Escudero-Catibog and DILG Honorable Secretary Atty. Benjamin \"Benhur\" Abalos, Jr.\nAlso present were DILG USec. Atty. Juan Victor Llamas, USec. Atty. Lord A. Villanueva, ASec. Atty. Jesi Howard Lanete, ASec. Elizabeth N. Lopez De Leon, Dir. Debie Torres, and Dir. Atty. Salvacion Baccay.\nTo read more about the projects and initiatives of the GMA Kapuso Foundation, visit www.GMANetwork.com .",
