They provide keyword tracking, backlink analysis, site audits, and competing domain analytics. Most offer discounted non-profit rates.\nShould our organisation focus more on local, national or global SEO exposure?\nBegin SEO locally, then expand nationally over 1-2 years.\nPursue global reach only if relevant based on cause and donor/volunteer base.\nStart hyperlocal.\nHow much time per week should our non-profit dedicate to SEO?\nSuggested time: 5-7 hours per week, depending on current strategy. This provides enough time for keyword research, content creation, link-building outreach, analytics review, and site quality checks. Assign clear owner accountability.\nHow soon could we expect to see results after starting to work on SEO?\nExpected timeline: Organic rankings improve slowly over 3-6 months. Maximum ROI comes at 9-12 months after starting SEO integration. Ensure proper expectations, then optimise and be patient.\nIs it ok to outsource SEO implementation instead of owning it internally?\nApproach recommendation: Yes, fully outsourcing to an SEO agency specialising in non-profits can be smart initially. Learn their strategies over 6-12 months, then gradually shift management of essentials internally to save costs. Partial outsourcing is acceptable in the long term for capacity but owns most execution.",
