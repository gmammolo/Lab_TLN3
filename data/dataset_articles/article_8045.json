  "text": "Elderly tourist found alive in Spain after night in the open A 75-year-old Dutch tourist who went missing in a mountainous area in southern Spain on Wednesday has been found alive, local Spanish [media](https://www.axarquiaplus.es/rescatan-a-un-anciano-holandes-con-alzheimer-en-murcia-tras-perderse-en-un-viaje-de-alicante-a-malaga/) reported. The man, who suffers from Alzheimer’s disease, was on a journey from Alicante to Malaga with his family and had stopped at a local look-out point in the Ricote Valley in Murcia when he wandered off. Rescue workers mounted an intensive search but only found him after drone footage showed the man walking around aimlessly the next day. He was exhausted, Gurdia Civil officers said, but otherwise unhurt. The case is the last in a spate of incidents involving missing tourists. Several tourists have [died](https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/06/dutch-tourist-found-dead-in-car-in-crete/) from heat-related incidents in Greece and some are still missing.
