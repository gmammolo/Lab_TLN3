  "text": "Friday, January 5th 2024, 8:52 am\nRogers County is getting ready to launch its new website to help Rogers County residents find the information they need more quickly.\nThe goal is to make the website more transparent about what's going on in Rogers County.\nCounty Commissioner Dan DeLozier said the website the county has been using made it more difficult for residents to find a lot of different information.\nThis could be anything from finding previous agendas for commissioners meetings to even get updates on road projects throughout the county.\nDeLozier said the new website will allow people to find just about anything they need within two or three clicks as opposed to having to go on an endless search for information.\n\"I think there is some frustration. We don’t hear a lot about that, but I would be frustrated if I tried to look on the old one. There was a lot of stuff that was not on there, but this one is going to be pretty proactive. It’s going to show everything we do,\" DeLozier said.\nDeLozier said transparency with Rogers County residents is something the county is always working on, and he believes this is another step in that direction.\n\"We are elected officials for one thing, and we work for the people. So we have to be able to give them information to see what is being done in the county, how their tax dollars are being spent, and everything else that goes along with that,\" DeLozier said.\nThe new website launches on Wednesday, Jan. 10, with the same address:\nRogersCounty.org\nJanuary 5th, 2024\nJanuary 5th, 2024\nJanuary 4th, 2024\nJanuary 5th, 2024\nJanuary 5th, 2024",
