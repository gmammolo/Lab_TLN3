  "text": "A new tool is available to help surfers, swimmers and rock fishers alike stay safe in the ocean. The Nearshore Wave Tool, developed by NSW's Environment and Heritage scientists, is updated every hour, providing up-to-date information about coastal conditions. The tool uses seven years of data from nearshore 'smart' buoys to create a 10-day wave forecast, as well as provide recent wave information. \"The NearShore Wave Tool helps you plan a day at the beach that will be safe for the whole family,\" Minister for Climate Change and the Environment Penny Sharpe said. \"If you're a rock fisher it will help you pick a low-risk day or time. And if you're a boater it will also make a difference. \"Those who love their rock fishing know it's a dangerous sport, but the NearShore Wave Tool will provide clear data that allows them to plan properly and avoid days that are too dangerous.\" The tool also combines 70 years of historic wave data and seafloor mapping to provide past wave data, which will help with coastal planning and prevention. \"It will help councils and other organisations look back on the historical data showing the impact of big flood events and storms,\" Sharpe said. \"We are getting more of those and understanding what happened in the past will help us plan for the future.\" The tool is expected to be used to manage risks of coastal hazards, such as \"proactive beach closures\", the state government said. It will also help travellers plan coastal visits based on better surf conditions.",
