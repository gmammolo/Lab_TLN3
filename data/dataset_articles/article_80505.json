  "text": "Pokemon, Fendi, and FRGMT have collaborated to release merchandise featuring Dragonite and its evolutionary family. The line of clothing and accessories includes items for both men and women, with a range of pieces such as shirts, sweaters, scarves, purses, and jewelry. Fendi and FRGMT have also partnered with Pokemon GO, allowing players to obtain exclusive collaboration items for their avatars. Pokemon , FRGMT and Fendi are collaborating to bring fans of the series merchandise featuring Dragonite and its evolutionary family. Those who enjoy the RPG franchise love to showcase their fandom through the use of clothing and accessories. Pokemon fans are not afraid of letting the world know how they feel about the games and anime series through their fashion sense.\nThe Pokemon Dragonite has been popular with the community for some time now. The pocket monster was one of the original 151 critters to be released and was the only Dragon-Type in the First Generation along with its evolutionary family. Even though more and more creatures with the Typing are released in every set of games, Dragonite proves that it is still one of the more beloved dragons to grace the franchise.\nRelated Pokemon Fan Crochets a Huge Dragonite Plush A crafty Pokemon fan shows off how large they had made their Dragonite crochet plush doll, even comparing its size to their own body. Now companies Fendi and FRGMT have teamed up with Pokemon to make a line of merchandise together . The clothing and accessories feature items for both men and women with a variety of pieces to choose from. These include shirts, sweaters, scarves, purses, and jewelry. Many of the items feature the popular Dragon-Type Pokemon , though Dratini and Dragonair are included as well. The clothing is on the pricier side, like the Dragonite bag that retails for $3,980.\nClose Fendi and FRGMT are also partnering with Pokemon GO to bring some of the pieces from the collaboration into the popular mobile title. Players will be able to receive a sweater by entering the code FENDIxFRGMTxPOKEMON in the game. There will also be a shirt and hat that gamers can obtain at certain PokeStops . Players will be able to equip the items on their Pokemon GO avatars and show off their fashion sense. The pieces from Fendi look good and will hopefully encourage other companies to do these sorts of collaborations that players can pick up to help show their appreciation for the legendary series.\nFendi is a luxury fashion brand that makes clothing and accessories for men, women, and children. The company was founded in Italy in 1925 and has made a name for itself for its leather goods. FRGMT is owned by Japanese designer Hiroshi Fujiwara and is a fashion brand that has teamed up with some of the biggest names in the clothing industry, including Converse, Levi's and Moncler. Fendi and FRGMT are the latest of many companies and artists to have a collaboration with Pokemon , which has led to many great products and bits of media that can be enjoyed by fans. Gamers will now have to wait to see who else decides to partner with the RPG giant and witness what they bring to the table for lovers of the franchise.",
