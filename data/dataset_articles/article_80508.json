[Tetrahydrocannabinol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563174/) (THC) is a naturally occurring medical compound with a wide range of medical applications. It is used to treat chemotherapy patients and stimulate appetite. Stimulation of appetite has a number of different treatment applications for health issues such as anorexia and AIDS. THC is produced by Cannabis sativa plants, which also create cannabidiol (CBD). THC can be ingested in several ways. It is commonly smoked or eaten in the form of THC edibles. With THC becoming legal on a much wider basis in recent years, many new products have been made available, and now, more people than ever are learning about and experimenting with THC. It is becoming increasingly common to find a rolling tray sitting on someone’s coffee table or to engage in a casual smoke session with friends and family. Weed usage has become much more acceptable in recent years and may continue to trend in that direction in the years to come. Potential Benefits of THC Marijuana has many [ medical applications](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/cannabis-marijuana-and-cannabinoids-what-you-need-to-know) and has been proven to be effective in the treatment of epilepsy, as well as other serious health conditions and illnesses. It may even provide relief for chronic pain sufferers and alleviate some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis. It is being studied in the treatment of conditions such as anxiety, HIV, irritable bowel syndrome, Tourettes, and many, many others. Potential Side Effects of THC Use of THC use creates an altered sense of time and creates mood changes. It can cause sluggish thinking, impaired memory and even psychosis in extreme cases. Taking high doses of THC can cause more severe side effects, such as delusions and hallucinations. Ingesting large quantities of [ weed edibles](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/sponsor-content/thc-gummies-5-thc-edibles-for-stress-pain-relief-and-sleep/) can lead to these more extreme side effects, as they can be slow to start having an effect, and it can be easy to over-indulge. In younger users of THC, this compound may impair brain development in the areas of thinking, memory and learning. Research is still being conducted to understand better these [ effects](https://nida.nih.gov/publications/drugfacts/cannabis-marijuana) and how long-term they may be. Studies of THC’s negative effects and potential long-term effects remain ongoing, as a lot of things about this plant have not been understood or known for very long, scientifically speaking. Studies and research are conducted all the time to learn more about THC, and as knowledge becomes available, it is tested and re-tested so it can be proven. Establishing scientific facts takes a long time and a lot of study, but scientists around the world are dedicated to learning more. FAQs Is THC safe? Safe is a relative term. When it comes to smoking marijuana, it does not harm the lungs the way tobacco products can. However, marijuana has long-term effects on memory and cognitive abilities. In areas of the world where marijuana is not legal, it is certainly not safe to try smoke shop products and smoking accessories, such as [THC gummies](https://www.seattlemet.com/discover/thc-delta/best-delta-9-gummies-6-thc-edibles-for-a-relaxing-high/), because you could be risking imprisonment merely for having these items. THC also carries with it the risk of addiction, and some say it can lead to additional and more varied drug use. Many studies about whether or not marijuana use can be linked to other drug use have been conducted, with results varying. Individual personality makeup can also play a role in addition, so the question of how safe marijuana is from this viewpoint is highly subjective and depends upon the person. Is THC legal? Whether or not THC is legal and to what degree is an answer with several parts. While [THC use has been legalized either for medical or recreational](https://www.seattlemet.com/discover/thc-delta/is-thc-legal/) use in many states in the U.S., it is still considered to be illegal at a federal level. The legality of THC is an ever-evolving issue that continues to change as this issue makes its way onto more and more ballots. This question can be answered in a number of different ways depending on when it is being asked, so the legality of THC continues to change with time. How much THC can I take? Fatal overdoses of marijuana are “unlikely,” according to the [ CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/marijuana/faqs.htm). However, it is possible to take a dangerous amount of THC. You may suffer from paranoia, panic, increased heart rate, high anxiety, extreme confusion, increased blood pressure, vomiting, and even hallucinations from ingesting too much. In other words, try to avoid washing down your gummies with [ THC drinks](https://www.houstoniamag.com/sponsored/2023/10/thc-drinks-best-cannabis-infused-beverages) while you take bong riffs all at once. Using edibles and beverages is the most common reason people over-consume marijuana, so slow down and pace yourself to avoid these extreme symptoms. If you think you are suffering from symptoms of too much THC use, consult with a physician and know that THC is not typically fatal, even in cases of extreme usage. It is best to remain as calm as possible. Sometimes, eating food can help with these symptoms, but do not eat any weed edibles, as this will only compound the problem. What is the difference between THC and CBD? Cannabis plants produce both [CBD and THC](https://www.seattlemet.com/discover/thc-delta/cbd-vs-thc-similarities-and-differences/), which are two different compounds created by the same plant. CBD, cannabidiol, and THC from the cannabis sativa plants have slightly different chemical compounds. THC creates psychoactive effects, which means the brain is affected, while CBD does not. It does not impair function, and it is not intoxicating, which is why CBD is legal, and THC is still illegal (or debated over its legality) in some places.
