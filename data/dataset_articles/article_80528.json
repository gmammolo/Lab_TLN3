  "text": "This topic was written by Sultan Al-Qahtani – The price of the Oral-B iO Series 7 smart electric toothbrush has dropped to $149 on the Amazon store after a $71 discount. This deal comes as part of a larger sale that includes a 55 percent discount on Oral-B toothbrushes. The iO Series 7 is a top pick for smart toothbrushes because it strikes a good balance between features and affordability, especially if you can get it at the current price. The toothbrush has a black and white LED display that tells you useful information such as mode, battery life, and how much time is left on the two-minute timer. The brush head comes with strong vibration, but it does not cause numbness to the lips like other smart toothbrushes. The illuminated ring also indicates whether you are pressing too hard or not hard enough. If you want to brush your teeth while looking at your phone, you can watch an entertainment animation of a set of teeth slowly turning from blue to white as internal sensors track the brush’s position and movement. The brush comes with a replacement head, case and charging base which you should only need to use twice a month. Source",
