Photo : PTI Hyderabad: Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief S Somanath said on Friday that the PSLV XPoSat launched on January 1 is doing \"very well\" while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the convocation of the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU) in Hyderabad. During the event, the ISRO chief was conferred with the Doctor of Philosophy (Honoris Causa) by the JNTU. \"First of January, we had a launch. PSLV XPoSat. The satellite is doing very well. All its instruments are now slowly switched on and working. We will get to know about the results soon,\" he said. While stating that this year will be eventful, Somanath said several other launches are proposed. \"Next launch is a GSLV launch, INSAT- 3DS, climate and weather satellite to track our cyclones, to look at the weather, the rain, the drought, and many other things. That satellite is going to be launched this month, possibly or may be at the beginning of February. Will have to see that it will be ready,\" he said. The ISRO chief also spoke about the scheduled manoeuver for the space agency’s first solar mission, Aditya L-1, which would be performed today - January 6 to put the spacecraft in the final destination orbit. \"Tomorrow, we have the Aditya-L1 insertion to Lagrange point... That will happen tomorrow. After that, the satellite will be there around, looking at the Sun and doing all the measurements. So, its journey of almost 1.5 million km is nearly getting completed,\" Somanath said in Hyderabad. While speaking to the media, Somanath also said that it is important to have longevity of a service by bringing down the cost of various activities. The Chandrayaan-3 mission achieved its landing with a much significantly lower cost than others in the world, he added.
