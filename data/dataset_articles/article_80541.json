  "text": "Isro to launch Europe's Proba-3 mission on PSLV, show formation flying in space\nThe launch vehicle of choice for this mission is the reliable PSLV-XL rocket, operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).\nListen to Story\nIn Short\n- The duo of satellites will align to create a 144-meter long solar coronagraph\n- This region of the Sun is known for its ghostly glow\n- The mission's success hinges on the precise positioning\nIndia will launch the European Space Agency's (ESA) pioneering Proba-3 mission in September 2024.\nThis ambitious project marks the world's first precision formation flying mission, with a pair of satellites designed to operate in unison as a 'large rigid structure' in the vastness of space.\nThe duo of satellites will align to create a 144-meter long solar coronagraph, an\ninstrument that will allow scientists to study the Sun's elusive corona with unprecedented proximity and detail.\nThis region of the Sun, known for its ghostly glow, has been challenging to observe due to the blinding brightness of the solar disk. However, Proba-3 aims to change that by mimicking an artificial eclipse in space, providing a continuous view of the corona closer to the solar rim than ever before.\nThe mission's success hinges on the precise positioning and coordination of the two spacecraft. To achieve this, ESA has developed a suite of cutting-edge technologies, including precision cold gas thrusters and vision-based detection systems.\nThese innovations will enable the satellites to maintain their relative positions with millimeter-scale accuracy, a feat akin to a carefully choreographed cosmic dance.\nThe Proba-3's formation flying also serves as a testbed for future multi-satellite missions, which could operate as singular virtual structures. This opens up possibilities for more complex and versatile space systems, potentially revolutionizing how we approach tasks like Earth observation, telecommunications, and deep-space exploration.\nThe launch vehicle of choice for\nthis mission is the reliable PSLV-XL rocket, operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).\nThe collaboration between ESA and ISRO exemplifies the growing trend of international partnerships in space endeavors, pooling resources and expertise to push the boundaries of what's possible.",
