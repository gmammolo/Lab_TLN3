  "text": "The fourth and final generation of the Dodge Dart was arguably the coolest ever.\nNowadays, the\nDodge Challenger and Charger are considered quintessential muscle cars, but Dodge once dabbled in muscle of many sizes. The Dodge Dart may have been marketed as an affordable, compact car, but its 1967 incarnation rapidly made itself a name in the muscle car world thanks to its combination of high-powered engine and small size, which made for an excellent power-to-weight ratio. Marketed at young, power-hungry drivers who wanted muscle car performance at a compact car price point, the Dart took the automotive world by storm. From the moment it launched, its sales were remarkable, and in 1960, Dart sales represented 87% of cars produced by Dodge. This popularity persisted when the 1967 model, thanks to its winning formula of large amounts of power shoehorned into a compact frame. As such, the Dart became the people's muscle car and proved itself to be one of the most popular mid-century Chrysler models.\nBut how did the Dart evolve, and why is the 1967 model the sweet spot? Let's find out.\nThe Dodge Dart was originally created at the start of the 1960s as a replacement for Plymouth models on the affordable end of the market. After a period of economic downturn at the tail end of the 1950s, Dodge production climbed to 367,804 cars in 1960, 87% of them being Darts. In 1962, a second generation followed, based on a brand new platform and with newly-renamed trim levels, which officially only lasted one year before being replaced.\nThe following year, in 1963, the Dart underwent yet another revamp, slowly getting rid of some 1950s-inspired styling cues and adding more modern options. It also grew in size with a 111-inch wheelbase, and it directly replaced the Dodge Lancer as a \"senior compact\" model. In 1965, both air conditioning and disc brakes were first introduced as an option. The third generation of the Dart lasted three years until in 1967, the fourth generation replaced it.\nThe 1967 Dart arrived on the scene during the heyday of muscle cars, and despite its relatively small size, it quickly became a part of the category. Compact muscle cars like the Dart attracted young people who wanted speed without the prohibitive insurance premiums that came with larger vehicles.\nIn terms of design, the new Dart represented a complete cosmetic departure from the first three generations of the model, eliminating styling elements introduced by automotive designer Virgil Exner when the Dart was first launched in the early '60s. The new Dart also brought a slimmed-down range that only included six models, as opposed to the previous generation's ten; the small station wagons were removed from the lineup, and the Dart was now available as a two- and four-door-sedan, a hardtop coupe, and a convertible. On the trim front, the base model was now simply renamed the \"Dart,\" dropping the 170 label.\nThe 1967 Dodge Dart underwent a huge styling change compared to previous versions (pictured below in chronological order), with most rounded elements abandoned and a more angular shape introduced. It now featured a bold fender line running from the front of the car to the back. A recessed grille was paired with protruding headlights at the outboard edges of the front fascia, and the rear wheel arch was cut off by a single-style crease. The back of the car echoed the same theme: the Dart's rear panel repeated the design seen in the front, with large square tail lights and a chrome bumper.\nThe Dart came in a wide variety of different colors, with a veritable rainbow of paint options becoming available: you could buy a Dart in 23 choices of color, from dark red to medium copper and everything in between. As automotive technology made leaps and bounds, a wide array of options for the Dart was introduced, signaling its entry into the muscle-car fight: prospective Dart buyers could order their pride and joy with tinted glass, headrests, two-tone paint, vinyl roof, AM radio, Rallye suspension, wheel covers, whitewall tires, and a tachometer (on the GT version).\nV8s had been a staple of the Dart lineup since day one, but they'd been more mild than wild with the exception of cars built to go racing. That changed in '67, though.\nThe revamped '67 Dodge Dart didn't just get an upgrade on the aesthetic front: its performance was boosted as well, bringing it firmly into \"compact muscle car\" territory. The standard 2.8-liter slant-six engine was carried over from the third-generation Dart but now produced 115 horsepower instead of the previous model's 101 hp, thanks to the presence of an updated carburetor and camshaft.\nOther engine options included a 3.7-liter\nslant-six and a 180-hp 4.5-liter V8 (replaced the following year by a 5.2-liter version). Transmission options included a three-speed manual, three-speed automatic, or a four-speed manual available with the Dodge Dart GT.\nFor the top-level GTS trim, Dodge took a page out of the hot-rodders' book by packing a compact car with a high-powered engine: the available options were a 5.6-liter V8 as standard or a 280-hp 6.3-liter big-block V8 - the most powerful engine option in the Dart range.\nThese larger motors were accommodated thanks to updates to the frame rail spacing and redesigned K-members.\nThe fourth generation Dart had numerous sporty packages available in its time, like the Convertriple and Hang 10, the Caravan Tan, Spirit of '76, and Dart Lite. But these were mainly visual packages. However, a few models existed that earned the Dart its stripes as a junior muscle car.\nThe high-performance member of the Dart lineup, the 1967 Dodge Dart GT was available as a two-door hardtop coupe or as a convertible. Standard equipment included bucket seats, full wheel covers, and a padded dashboard; power steering was available as an option. The GT had a few additional styling elements that distinguished it from the base model Dart: a central badge was added to the grille and repeated on the front fenders. The Dart GT also came with the option of an upgraded powertrain: a four-speed manual transmission with a floor-mounted shift lever.\nIn response to the\nChevrolet Nova SS, Dodge launched the Dart GT Sport (GTS). It was a relative sleeper of a car, with its exterior unchanged but a 383ci V8 shoved under the hood. The very next year (1968), Dodge dropped to a smaller 340ci engine, claimed to produce 275 hp, but widely accepted to produce more, leaving the 383 as an option.\nIn addition to the bigger motor, the GTS also received\nstandard Rallye suspension and a high-flow exhaust, and speccing the 383 added six-leaf rear springs in addition to a bigger front antiroll bar and more robust torsion bars. The 383 also posed a few problems due to its size, with modified exhaust manifolds and no room for air conditioning or power steering.\nBut the cream of the crop was the Hurst Hemi Dart. Built with Super Stock racing in mind, Dodge charged Hurst Performance to build them. They could be had with a 440ci (7.2-liter) RB big block, but the bulk was sold with a 426 (7.0-liter) Hemi motor instead -\n80 were built in this spec.\nAccording to Larry Shepard, Chrysler staff engineer at the time, Dodge built approximately 600 Hemi Darts, built to the same spec as the 383 GTs, just with the Hemi engine.\n1976 was considered the final year for the fourth-gen Dart, but it wasn't the end of the road for the name. It was revived in 2013 as a successor to the Dodge Neon and became a compact FWD sedan mechanically related to the Chrysler 200 and Alfa Romeo Giulietta.\nEngine options were a 1.4-liter turbo four-cylinder (160 hp/184 lb-ft), a 2.0-liter Tigershark four-cylinder (160 hp/148 lb-ft), and a 2.4-liter Tigershark four-pot (184 hp/171 lb-ft), with either a six-speed manual or automatic (dual-clutch on the 1.4T).\nThe Dart (PF) remained in\nproduction until September 2016 (March 2017 in China) before it was put out to pasture, but it never lived up to the legend that was the original Dart.",
