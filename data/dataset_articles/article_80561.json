  "text": "On the occasion of celebrating her 500th robot-assisted weight-loss surgery at Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center, Dr. D’Arcy Duke reflected on her 20-year career as a Johnstown surgeon. “I am honored to have reached this significant milestone in my career,” Duke said. “Surrounded by a great team with brilliant minds, I am grateful to continue to provide our patients with the most advanced, minimally invasive options resulting in faster recovery and better overall outcomes.” Duke has become a trailblazer for robotic-assisted surgery at Conemaugh, using the technology for weight-loss procedures, including gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy and revisional bariatric surgery, as well as hernia repair, and acid reflux and gallbladder surgery. Minimally invasive robotic surgery procedures are performed through small incisions. “The da Vinci robot allows surgeons to perform complex operations with more precision, flexibility and control than is possible with conventional techniques,” Duke said. “The robot translates the surgeon’s hand motions into smaller, more precise movements.” ‘Wanted to give back’ She earned her medical degree from Temple University School of Medicine in Philadelphia and completed her residency at Boston University before returning to Johnstown. Duke said her exposure to the larger university-related medical systems made her appreciate the expertise at Memorial. “I grew up around here,” Duke said. “I knew what the hospital had to offer and I wanted to give back to the community.” Duke’s medical career began in 2002 when she joined the surgery team at Conemaugh and became a colleague of her father, surgeon Dr. Bruce E. Duke, who joined the hospital in 1971. After two years in Johnstown, she completed fellowship training in bariatric surgery at UPMC in Pittsburgh and became a fellow of the American College of Surgeons. “It was cutting-edge in 2004,” she said. “I was able to do that and expand that in this area.” Family ties Bruce Duke has remained in the Johnstown area after retiring in 2011. His daughter said he enjoys the region and he likes to fish. D’Arcy Duke said that as a child, she didn’t intend to follow her father’s footsteps, and her father did not push her or her sister toward any career path. “He was not involved in pressuring us,” D’Arcy Duke said. “Whatever we were good at, we could go in that direction.” Randy Griffith is a reporter for The Tribune-Democrat.
