  "text": "detikbanten.com TECH — 2024 will be the focal point for exploration and research of the Sun at the center of the Solar System. NASA has ambitious plans to complete what they call a “solar landing” using the Parker spacecraft.\nHowever, it is important to note that the term “landing” here is not a physical landing as we know it on planets or moons. The sun is not a solid object that can be stepped on or explored. Instead, NASA details that it’s more like “touching a star.”\nThis will be the second event for the Parker solar probe to carry out this exploration. His first mission occurred when Parker first touched the Sun’s atmosphere.\nThis latest mission aims to bring humans a deeper understanding of the Sun by placing Parker closer to its surface than ever before.\nHowever, executing a “solar lander” as planned by Parker is no easy task. This spacecraft will encounter very intense heat and radiation during its journey.\nIn this mission, Parker is expected to fly seven times closer to the Sun than previous spacecraft. NASA admits that this is new exploration because this region has never been explored before. Likewise, with Parker’s knowledge and resilience, NASA is still looking for answers about how this vehicle will survive in these extreme conditions.\nHowever, the risk taken is worth the potential new knowledge to be gained. The Parker solar probe will provide further data about the Sun and its surface, helping scientists obtain more details to improve predictions of the Sun’s future\nweather, which will become increasingly crucial as the Sun approaches its maximum point in 2025.\n2024-01-04 16:20:44\n#Banten #Beats #NASA #Prepares #Solar #Landing #Parker #Space #Shuttle #Mission",
