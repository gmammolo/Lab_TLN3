  "text": "- Whales have bought 14 million ADA in the last 14 days.\n- ADA was overbought but the $0.55 region seems like a good entry area.\nIf things go as expected, the price of\n[Cardano [ADA]]https://ambcrypto.com/search/cardano should increase in the coming days. The reason for this prediction could be linked to the way whales have been accumulating the token for the last 14 days.\nTo arrive at this conclusion, AMBCrypto checked the balance of addresses of ADA holders.\nCardano whales set to restart the journey\nUsing Santiment’s data, we found that the 1 million to 10 million cohort had\nincreased the number of ADA owned. On the 20th of December, the supply held by this cohort was 15.96%. But at press time, that percentage had increased to 16.36%.\nRecently, ADA was\naffected by the widespread price collapse propelled by [Bitcoin’s [BTC]]https://ambcrypto.com/search/bitcoin dump. But before the abrupt move, the Cardano native token changed hands at $0.63. Despite the fall to $0.55, ADA’s 30-day performance remained a 29.14% hike.\nHowever, it is important to mention that this was not the first time whales were involved in a buying spree. In November 2023, AMBCrypto\nreported a similar occurrence.\nThe accumulation during that period foreshadowed an ADA price rally. So, considering the cryptocurrency’s history, it is not out of place to expect the same outcome.\nSignals say “It’s time to buy”\nCan ADA repeat the same feat? This leads us to analyze the state of things from the technical side. According to the 4-hour chart, the Aroon Down (blue) had fallen to 21.34%. The Aroon Up (orange), on the other hand, had left the 01.06% it was on the 4th of January.\nAt press time, the Arron Up had increased to 14.29%. Though this increase was mild, it depicts a situation where the bullish momentum is slowly returning. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showed the impact on the price might not be quick.\nAs of this writing, the RSI was 33.14, indicating how Cardano was recovering from its oversold level. For the token to rise back to $0.60, buying pressure has to increase.\nHowever, indications from the Directional Movement Index (DMI) showed that this has not yet been the case. The +DMI (green) at press time, was 10.78. AMBCrypto also observed the -DMI (red) which was 38.16.\nFor ADA’s price to increase, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has to stop backing the -DMI (red). Should the +DMI rise above the -DMI, and the ADX (yellow) stays above a reading of 25, then ADA might price higher.\nIn addition, we checked out the Adjusted Price-DAA Divergence. At the time of writing, the\nmetric was down to -65.50%.\nIs your portfolio green?\nADA Profit Calculator\nFor context, the Adjusted Price-DAA Divergence shows how much of a difference in the Daily Active Addresses (DAA)\ntriggers an entry or exit.\nSince the price declined more than the DAA, it means an entry opportunity may have presented itself before a potential bull market begins.",
