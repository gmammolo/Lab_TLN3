  "text": "- It's that time again! \"Mad Money\" host Jim Cramer rings the lightning round bell, which means he's giving his answers to callers' stock questions at rapid speed.\nImmunoGen: \"That's AbbVie's property now, let's move on.\" Realty Income: \"I want you to stay with it...I really like it, it's a very steady story.\" Micron: \"I think the stock can tread water or go back to the high seventies...If there really is a PCU refresh cycle because of this Microsoft button, you're not going to be able to buy Micron this cheap again this year.\"\n Bitfarms: \"I don't really know Bitfarms...I just feel like it's just speculative.\" Ramaco: \"I'm not a buyer, let it go up without me.\" GE Healthcare: \"I think it's just ridiculously cheap, I think it's doing so many great things...I'm just sticking with it over the long haul. I like that business very much.\"\nMoney Report\nCoherent: \"Coherent's a little too expensive.\" Arm: \"I think Rene Haas is doing a fantastic job...This company is doing so much so right. They are going to dominate cellphone, PC, hyperscale. This is one you want to own.\" Teva: \"I'm not a Teva guy.\" TKO: \"I actually don't understand how to value this company.\"\n The CNBC Investing Club Charitable Trust holds shares of GE Healthcare.\n ",
