  "text": "At 12th JNTU convocation, Somnath says Isro’s Accomplishments Ignited Interest In Aeronautical Engineering Among Students And Is Looking To Have More Tie-Ups With Start-Ups & MSMEs.The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) is looking to have more collaborations with medium and small scale enterprises (MSMEs) and start-ups so that young innovators can contribute to space missions. Isro chairman Sreedhara Panicker Somnath told this to a large gathering at the 12th convocation of the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU) in the city on Friday.“Today, our job is to promote space tech. Therefore, our efforts are towards encouraging and partnering with industry leaders with ideas, innovations, who are capable of creating a vibrant economy around space technology,” he said, and added that Isro’s accomplishments have ignited interest in aeronautical engineering and science among students.“Information about missions like the one to Mars and Chandrayaan-3 have reached every corner of the country. Hence, we want to connect with academia as well,” Somnath said.Calling Hyderabad a techno-savvy city, he said that it had a rich heritage, thriving industry, healthy academic environment, and vibrant economic activity, which is needed to foster innovation and entrepreneurship. “Hyderabad has the National Remote Sensing Center of Isro which focuses on various applications in space helping in sectors like agriculture, weather, topography, disaster management. The centre has over 25 such satellites serving the country in various ways,” he said.He also reiterated Isro’s budget-friendly approach to space research which is rooted in the Indian culture of striving to get the best at low cost. “People from the West are beyond surprised at how India managed to pursue missions at such a low cost. It’s not cheap nor are we frugal. It’s advanced tech that Indians are capable of producing,” he added.Furthermore, he said the people forgot the three failures before successful landing of Chandrayaan 3. “However commendable the mission may be, hard work, dedication and commitment goes into emerging successful after failures,” he said.",
