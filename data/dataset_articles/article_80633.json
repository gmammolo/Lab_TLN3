  "text": "Maverick billionaire Elon Musk has been teasing the\nintegration of Dogecoin payments into his companies for years, but new clues suggest he is dead serious about letting customers buy Tesla vehicles with the meme coin. Unlike other firms accepting crypto via third parties, Tesla built its own custom Doge-only payment system for merchandise.\nAccording to Dogecoin advocate @Dogecoin_Wins, this\nreveals Musk’s true aims. Building an in-house Doge infrastructure requires blockchain experts, developers, security staff, and customer service agents specifically trained in the technology. With costs likely reaching seven figures, Tesla wouldn’t make this investment just to sell some mugs and belt buckles.\nInstead, it seems Tesla is using merchandise as a low-risk way to prepare for eventually accepting Dogecoin as payment for vehicles. By training staff and working through potential issues now, Tesla will be ready when the time comes to roll out Dogecoin vehicle transactions. As @Dogecoin_Wins stated, “It’s much easier to go through this learning process selling $20 coffee mugs than $80,000 cars.”\nThe evidence suggests Elon Musk fully intends to let customers purchase Tesla vehicles with Dogecoin down the road. Crypto payments for cars appear to be coming after these initial steps with merchandise.\nAlso read:\n[Crypto scams on X surge as Elon Musk lowers gold check price]",
