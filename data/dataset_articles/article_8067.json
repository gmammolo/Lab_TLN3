  "text": "( MENAFN - Kuwait News Agency (KUNA)) WASHINGTON, June 21 (KUNA) -- Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for avoiding further escalation in Lebanon on hand and also increasing aid to the Gaza Strip.\nState Department spokesman Mathew Miller revealed that this statement came during Blinken's meeting with an Israeli official delegation.\nMiller said that Blinken \"also underscored the importance of avoiding further escalation in Lebanon and reaching a diplomatic resolution that allows Israeli and Lebanese families to return to their homes.\"\nBlinken discussed ongoing efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and secure the release of all hostages, indicated Miller, noting that the Secretary emphasized the need to take additional steps to surge humanitarian aid into Gaza and plan for post-conflict governance, security, and reconstruction.\nEarlier this month, Blinken was on his eighth tour to the Middle East since October 7, 2023 in an effort to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.
