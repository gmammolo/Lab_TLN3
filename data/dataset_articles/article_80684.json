  "title": "Google's Gemini AI Features Are Coming To Oppo And OnePlus Phones",
  "text": "Major smartphone brands Oppo and OnePlus recently joined hands with Google to bring its latest artificial intelligence (AI) model Gemini 1.0 Ultra to its smartphones. Both Oppo and OnePlus are also planning to launch Gemini-powered smartphones later this year. Gemini on smartphones promises to completely change the way users interact with their devices.\nNicole Zhang, General Manager of AI Product for Oppo and OnePlus, also announced the launch of several Generative AI models for customers in China. These models are available to over ten million users of devices like the Oppo Find X7 and OnePlus 12, allowing them to access AI-generated content anytime, anywhere.\n\"By collaborating with Google to integrate both Gemini and Google Cloud AI into smartphones, and by forming alliances with other industry pioneers for a variety of AI experiences, we are thrilled to ambitiously broaden the scope of mobile AI innovations,\" Zhang said in a statement.\nAt the event, the smartphone manufacturers talked about the many ways AI can benefit mobile users. Nicole mentioned four important qualities she thinks AI on phones should have: it should use resources well, learn on its own, understand the real world, and inspire creativity in users.\nThe companies also confirmed that they will be working to build the perfect mix of hardware, operating system, and ecosystem to help AI flourish. Further, Oppo and OnePlus are already working with a range of partners to deliver AI experiences to their users, including AI Eraser.\nRecently, OnePlus launched a new AI Eraser feature for its smartphones. This feature, powered by OnePlus' special large language model (LLM), makes editing images easier and more intuitive. The AI Eraser is available on OnePlus devices, including the OnePlus 12, OnePlus 12R, OnePlus 11, OnePlus Open and OnePlus Nord CE 4.\nAI Eraser is a tool that helps you easily delete things you don't want in your pictures. For example, if there are people or trash in the background, you can select them, and AI Eraser will automatically remove them and fill in the background so it looks natural. It makes your photos look perfect without any extra effort.",
