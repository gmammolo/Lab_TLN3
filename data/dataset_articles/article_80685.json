  "text": "The BMW Group reports 594,671 global vehicle sales during the first quarter of 2024 (up 1.1% year-over-year). The small overall growth was accompanied by a healthy increase in all-electric car sales. In Q1, BMW Group's ( [BMW](https://insideevs.com/bmw/), [Mini](https://insideevs.com/mini/) and [Rolls-Royce](https://insideevs.com/rolls-royce/)) battery electric vehicle (EV) sales amounted to 82,700 units (up 28% year-over-year).

This year, the company intends to increase EV sales to over 500,000 and achieve a 20% EV share. The German manufacturer also celebrates the milestone of one million fully electric vehicles on the roads (since the market launch of the [BMW i3](https://insideevs.com/bmw/i3/) over a decade ago). Meanwhile, plug-in hybrid car sales continued to decrease with only 39,916 sales in Q1 (down 13% year-over-year) and a 6.7% share. Overall, the BMW Group sold 122,616 rechargeable cars last quarter (up 11% year-over-year), which was 20.6% of the total volume (compared to 18.8% a year earlier).
