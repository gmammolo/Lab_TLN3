  "text": " Key takeaways: Saruparib at 60 mg/day demonstrated deep, durable responses with a high response rate and tumor reduction in most patients. Certain patients may be able remain on treatment longer at an optimal dose. Perspective from Nancy Chan, MD Saruparib conferred clinically impactful treatment outcomes among adults with breast cancer who harbor certain genetic mutations, according to data presented at American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting.\nResearchers also reported a favorable safety profile for the investigational agent, along with a low dose reduction rate compared with certain approved [poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP)] inhibitors.\nData derived from Yap TA, et al. Abstract CT014. Presented at: American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting; April 5-10, 2024; San Diego. “The excellent safety and tolerability profile, along with the favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, may enable patients to remain on saruparib treatment with sustained maximal target engagement and limited dose reductions or discontinuation,” Timothy A. Yap, MBBS, PhD, professor of investigational cancer therapeutics and vice president and head of clinical development at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, said in a press release.\nBackground, methods Saruparib (AstraZeneca) is a first-in-class polymerase-1 selective inhibitor with PARP1 selectivity and potency shown through preclinical trials.\nThe phase 1/phase PETRA trial is evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of saruparib among 306 adults with homologous recombination repair-deficient breast, ovarian, pancreatic or prostate cancer who harbor certain genetic alterations. Safety and tolerability served as the study’s primary endpoints, with secondary endpoints evaluating pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, preliminary efficacy and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis.\nDose escalation comprised part A, ranging from 10 to 140 mg daily, whereas part B included dose expansions at 20/40/90 mg daily among PARP inhibitor-naive patients.\nResults, next steps Researchers observed the 60 mg/day dose as well tolerated by patients, with low rates of dose reduction or treatment discontinuation.\nSaruparib displayed higher-fold pharmacokinetic coverage over the target effective concentration for all doses compared with approved PARP inhibitors and durable poly ADP-ribosylation inhibition.\nUpon interim analysis, researchers observed that the objective response rate in patients with breast cancer trended higher at 60 or 90 mg vs. 20 mg, with 60 mg/day being the recommended phase 2 dose.\nAmong patients who received the 60 mg/day (n = 31), researchers noted an objective response rate of 48.4% (80% CI, 35.7-61.3) and a median PFS of 9.1 months (80% CI, 7.2-9.3).\nPatients in which ctDNA could be evaluated exhibited a molecular response prior to their first scan, which researchers indicate predicted PFS, thus supporting ctDNA kinetics as an early predictive biomarker for efficacy.\nAccording to researchers, all currently approved PARP inhibitors block both PARP1 and PARP2, which limits utility due to toxicity. They believe this interim analysis of the PETRA trial demonstrates the clinical effectiveness and safety of saruparib among patients with homologous recombination repair-deficient breast cancers.\nTimothy A. Yap “The favorable safety profile of saruparib together with the low dose reduction rate compared with approved PARP inhibitors may allow patients to remain on treatment longer at an optimal dose with superior drug exposures and maximal target engagement, which could lead to improved efficacy,” Yap said during a presentation. “Further evaluation of saruparib in the phase 3 trial setting is ongoing at the recommended phase 2 dose of 60 mg daily.”\nReferences: Next-generation PARP inhibitor demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with homologous recombination repair-deficient breast cancer (press release).
