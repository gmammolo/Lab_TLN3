  "text": "Your iPhone 15 finally comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable that can charge all of your devices, but you still need a power adapter—something small, portable, reliable, and fast. We’ve got the perfect one for you: Amazon is selling Apple’s 35W Dual USB-C Port Compact Power Adapter for $40, a savings of $19 (when you click the coupon on the page) and the lowest price we’ve ever seen. This power adapter is a little pricey at $59, but for $40 it checks all the boxes: a compact design, downward-facing ports for easy cable management, and folding prongs for extra portability. Either port can deliver 35 watts of juice to your device for charging a MacBook Air or iPad alone, and it has enough power to fast charge an iPhone and AirPods or Apple Watch at the same time. There are plenty of other lower-priced power adapters that offer the same ports and wattage, but many of them split power between the two ports regardless of how many devices are plugged in. Plus you’ll get the peace of mind knowing Apple certifies it for use with its products—along with a great price. So go grab one and never worry about bringing the right charger again.",
