  "text": "The first gameplay trailer for Overwatch 2 Season 10, titled Venture Forth after its new Damage dealer, is live. It provides an overview of the content that players can expect, including a new limited-time event – Mirrorwatch. Check it out below.\nAs the name implies, Mirrorwatch sees Overwatch and Talon switching alignments. The former has red and black armor glowing with menace, while the latter has blue and white uniforms. While other characters also have different looks, perhaps the most detailed is Vengeance Mercy, the new Mythic Skin for the season.\nWhen venturing into the new limited-time mode, players can take advantage of revamped abilities, like Mercy firing on enemies with her staff, Doomfist’s block creating a barrier to shield his allies, and more. Aside from Venture and Mirrorwatch, Season 10 also features a limited-time trial for Clash , the new game mode, and its first map, Hanaoka (a revamped version of Hanamura).\nOverwatch 2 Season 10: Venture Forth starts on April 16th , so stay tuned for more details.",
