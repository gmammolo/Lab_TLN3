  "text": "The positive market environment has also reached our insiders. Compared to the first quarter, our crypto expert index increased significantly. This increased from 74 in the first quarter to 84 in the second quarter. You can find out exactly how the index is composed in our free Insider Report.\nBitcoin Halving: Insiders expect these market effects The extent to which Bitcoin Halving has an influence on the Bitcoin price is controversial. In the Insider Report, Dr. Joachim Schwerin, senior economist at the European Commission: “Not immediately, but probably a few weeks after the halving. Every supply shock has economic effects, and despite all the expectations, these are currently not fully priced in – especially since this is not the last halving and the supply shortage is therefore structural and periodic.\nHowever, Prof. Dr. has a slightly different opinion. Horst Treiblmaier from the Modul University Vienna, who sees the halving already largely priced in. Meanwhile, the Stuttgart Stock Exchange’s corporate influencer, Richard Dittrich, points out that it should not only be taken into account how many Bitcoin are currently on the market, “but also how many of them are deposited on trading venues for short-term trading, this value is current historically very low.”\nIf you want to know what other experts think about the halving, what expectations they have of the Bitcoin price and assess the risk of setbacks in the coming months, you can find out in the free BTC-ECHO Insider Report.\nThis might also interest you\nsource site-17",
