  "text": "CAMC offering new technology to reduce unnecessary breast cancer surgeries CHARLESTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) - When it comes to breast cancer. we know how important early detection is to save lives. Charleston Area Medical Center has implemented new cutting-edge technology to locate and remove cancer cells in their early stages. CAMC surgeons are the first in West Virginia to offer groundbreaking techniques that could spare breast cancer patients unnecessary surgeries. “It gives women exposure to the newest and best way to attack and treat breast cancer,” said Dr. Yancy Short, one of CAMC’s surgeons offering this new tech to help early-stage breast cancer patients, known as Magseed and Magtrace. Magseed helps to locate tumors you can’t feel. “The Magseed you literally put into the tumor itself, and it’s about the size of a grain of rice, and it’s a magnetic coil that emits a signal then I can use a probe to help me find it,” Short said. “The best way to describe it as GPS to guide me in.” It helps surgeons see within a centimeter of the tumor. “I think it’s a little neater, a little cleaner way to find the tumor and remove the tumor,” Short said. “I think it’s more exact, and I can remove less tissue and have a higher chance of getting it all which is called negative margins.” Magtrace is a non-radioactive, single-injection liquid that helps determine if cancer has spread in the lymph nodes. “It colors the node a brownish color and emits a signal that I can pick up with the same probe I used for the Magseed,” Short said. Short has a personal connection to his work because he knows what his patients are going through. “My wife had breast cancer in 2013, so I have a personal vendetta against breast cancer and I feel breast cancer is very prominent in West Virginia,” he said. “I think this brings cutting edge to them and I think they deserve it.” If no invasive cancer is detected with it, patients don’t have to undergo any additional surgery.
