  "text": "Sign up for the Morning Brief email newsletter to get weekday updates from The Weather Channel and our meteorologists.\nIn the quest for radiant, youthful skin, the latest buzz isn&s;t about exotic botanical extracts or high-tech innovations, but rather a humble yet extraordinary ingredient: snail slime.\n\"Snail mucin essentially is just the mucus that snails secrete,\" explains Dr. Charlene Lam , a dermatologist and associate professor at Pennsylvania State University.\n&a;ldquo;The mucin they secrete on their feet is very lubricating and allows them to slide across tables and even hang upside down,&a;rdquo; Dr. Lam told weather.com. &a;ldquo;They have mucin in their backs that can be very hydrating and antimicrobial. And that's the mucin that the skincare industry has kind of taken hold of.&a;rdquo;\nWith its unique blend of hydrating agents and anti-aging factors like collagen and antioxidants, snail mucin has emerged as a skincare powerhouse.\n&a;ldquo;All of these ingredients are very familiar to us in the skincare industry so it's one of those unique compounds that almost seems like the ultimate multitasker,&a;rdquo; says Dr. Lam, underscoring its potential to address multiple skincare concerns in one fell swoop.\nDespite its ancient roots &a;ndash; even Hippocrates recognized its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties &a;ndash; snail mucin is experiencing a resurgence in popularity as modern skincare scientists (and teens on TikTok ) delve deeper into its potential.\nBut few people know what actually goes into collecting the mucin. Dr. Lam explains that the secretions go through a filtration and cleaning process once extracted from the snails. The resulting blend has been found very safe for patients in clinical trials.\nDr. Lam emphasizes the need for continued research to substantiate the claims surrounding snail mucin fully. &a;ldquo;I think that the benefits can be really promising, though the research is still very new, and like most things, the devils are in the details.&a;rdquo;\nAnd if adding slime to your skincare routine doesn't sound appealing, Dr. Lam offers practical advice: &a;ldquo;It's definitely one of those personal preferences,&a;rdquo; she admits, adding that all of the ingredients in snail mucin can also be found in regular drugstore products.\n\"So if it does bother you, then I would go another route.&a;rdquo;\nMORE ON WEATHER.COM\n-&a;#8203; The Best Foods For Your Skin, According To Doctors\n-&a;#8203; What Happens To Your Skin When You Wear Makeup To Work Out?\n-&a;#8203; Five Places You're Forgetting To Put Sunscreen\nThe Weather Company's primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.\n\\n",
