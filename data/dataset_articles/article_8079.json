  "text": "How homeowners can be ready before a flood GREEN BAY, Wis. (WBAY) - Stay safe before an emergency. Our region has seen a lot of rain lately. The ground is saturated so fresh [rain has nowhere to go](https://www.wbay.com/2024/06/21/public-works-working-prevent-flooding-this-weekend/). Some counties will be under flood watches starting Friday afternoon. If you’re a homeowner, you have homework to do. Ready Wisconsin and other safety officials want you to first and foremost get flood insurance, especially if you live in a high-risk flood zone. Most homeowners insurance doesn’t cover flood damage. FEMA has a website where you can [look up your address](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/search) and learn more about the risk of flooding in your neighborhood. Don’t let your hard work be washed away. Also to prepare: - Secure your home -- you can mitigate flood damage by doing things like elevating and anchoring utilities, including electrical panels, propane tanks and sockets. - Put outdoor furniture away - Do a household inventory -- take photos and videos of all major household items and valuables, including serial numbers if you can; you’ll need those to file insurance claims - Have an [emergency kit packed](https://www.wbay.com/2021/04/13/what-to-pack-in-your-severe-weather-safety-kit/)in case you need to leave your home quickly During a storm or heavy rain event, stay informed. Tune into the [First Alert Weather 24/7](https://www.wbay.com/livestream2/) channel or have a [weather app](https://onelink.to/g349n3) with National Weather Service notifications turned on. Get to higher ground and obey evacuation orders if that ever happens. Copyright 2024 WBAY. All rights reserved.",
