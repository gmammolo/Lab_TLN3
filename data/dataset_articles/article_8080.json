  "text": "‘Not all patients are humans’: 14 puppies rescued from rollover vehicle crash WOODSTOCK, CT ( [WFSB](https://www.wfsb.com/2024/06/20/14-puppies-rescued-rollover-crash-woodstock/)/Gray News) - Fourteen puppies were rescued from a rollover crash that closed a road in Woodstock, Connecticut Thursday morning. Several fire agencies responded to Senexet Road between Laurel and Bull Hill roads for a single-vehicle rollover accident involving wires down. Firefighters found a pole that had snapped, with wires down, and called Eversource CT to disable the power. Power was out in the area while the electricians worked. Officials say minor injuries were originally reported, but no one ended up being hurt. First responders also rescued and provided care for 14 puppies at the scene. the Muddy Brook Fire Department [shared photos on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=791535169786660&id=100067905522124&ref=embed_post) of firefighters interacting with the puppies. The Necogg Humane Society and a doctor from Peake Brook Veterinary Center responded to the scene to provide veterinary care and shelter to the animals, firefighters said. Some puppies will be taken to a veterinary office for further care. Drivers were warned to expect a “long duration road closure.” Copyright 2024 WFSB via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",
