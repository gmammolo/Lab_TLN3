The photograph archive was originally donated to the archive in 1985. After the publication was sold to Miller Freeman, Inc. in San Francisco, CA, the archive had an agreement to archive materials with the new publishing company for a time. During this time, starting April 15, 1992, 19 boxes (roughly 16 cubic feet) were added to the collection.\nRecommended Citation\nMedical World News, \"Medical World News Vol. 7 (31), Front Cover\" (1966).
