  "text": "Share on Pinterest A new study finds a dental cleaning can be important to staying heart healthy. Studio Firma / Stocksy Studio Firma/Stocksy United A new study finds that treating gum disease can help decrease the risk of AFib. Growing evidence has found that periodontitis, a gum infection that damages the tissues around the teeth, is closely linked to many other systemic diseases. These diseases include coronary artery disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. Having your teeth cleaned after undergoing a heart procedure for atrial fibrillation (AFib) may help prevent the condition from recurring, a new study has found.\nThe report , published April 10 in the J ournal of the American Heart Association , found that treating gum disease could improve the prognosis of AFib, a condition that causes an irregular heart rhythm.\nThough the American Heart Association (AHA) does not list gum diseases as a modifiable risk factor for AFib, growing evidence shows that periodontitis, a gum infection that damages the tissues around the teeth, is closely linked to many other systemic diseases, including coronary artery disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes.\nScientists are just beginning to understand the link between oral health and heart health, but suspect harmful bacteria in the mouth may travel through the body, including portions of the heart, leading to inflammation.\nThe study, one of the first to investigate how gum disease treatment impacts AFib, highlights the potential cardiovascular benefits of practicing good oral hygiene.\n“Many studies have shown a link between size of the left atrium, presence of obstructive sleep apnea, frequency of atrial fibrillation episodes of baseline and gender but now we should consider gum health as a modifiable risk factor,” Bradley Serwer, MD, an interventional cardiologist and Chief Medical Officer at VitalSolution , told MDLinx.\nGum disease linked to a higher risk of AFib recurrence The researchers evaluated 288 individuals in Japan who were being treated for AFib with a minimally invasive procedure called catheter ablation . In radiofrequency catheter ablation, a physician uses a small catheter to heat parts of the heart tissue that are linked to cause Afib.\nThe study was conducted from April 1, 2020 to July 31, 2022.\nOf the group, 92 underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation along with treatment for gum inflammation.\nThe other 191 participants also received the ablation procedure but did not have their gum inflammation treated.\nThe researchers followed up one, three, six, nine, and 12 months after each patient’s ablation, and then every six months.\nOver the course of the study, 24% of the participants experienced AFib recurrence.\nThose who had severe gum inflammation but had it treated were 61% less likely to experience AFib again compared to those with severe gum inflammation that did not have it treated.\nThe research team also found that, in general, people who experienced AFib recurrence were more likely to have more severe gum disease.\nThe biggest risk factors for AFib recurrence included having gum disease, being female, and experiencing irregular heartbeat for over two years.\n“It appears that patients with significant periodontal disease are more prone to atrial fibrillation recurrence after an atrial fibrillation ablation,” Paul Drury, MD , a board-certified cardiologist and associate medical director of electrophysiology at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, told Healthline.\nWhy regular dental exams may help prevent afib Although the study was conducted in a small group of participants, the findings suggest people with AFib could benefit from receiving regular dental exams.\n“The treatment of periodontal disease improves the chances of maintaining freedom from recurrent atrial fibrillation after an ablation,” Drury said.\nInflammation in the mouth may contribute to the development of other chronic diseases.\nPrevious evidence has found that chronic or acute inflammation, a response seen with periodontal disease , is associated with AFib.\nBacteria in the mouth may also travel to other organs, including the heart, and cause damage, past evidence suggests.\n“Other studies have shown that poor oral hygiene increases the risk of transient bacteria in the blood, and this can inflame or damage blood vessels or the heart directly,” says Serwer.\nPast research has also determined that people who are scheduled to undergo heart valve replacement need to see a dentist beforehand to reduce their risk of infection or premature failure of the valve, Serwer added.\nScientists are continuing to investigate how tooth and gum inflammation, and the bacteria in the mouth, impact overall health.\n“This report is very interesting and shows a link between periodontal disease and atrial fibrillation, however larger, randomized trials are still needed to prove the concept,” Drury said.\nThe bottom line: New research has discovered that treating gum disease could improve the management of atrial fibrillation after catheter ablation. Scientists are just beginning to understand the link between oral health and heart health, but suspect harmful bacteria in the mouth may travel through the body, including the heart. The findings highlight the potential cardiovascular benefits of good oral hygiene.",
