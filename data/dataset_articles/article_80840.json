  "text": "Indaptus Therapeutics Presents Positive Mechanism of Action Data at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting NEW YORK, April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Indaptus Therapeutics, Inc, (Nasdaq: INDP), a clinical stage biotechnology company dedicated to pioneering innovative cancer and viral infection treatments, was proud to unveil its poster at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in San Diego on Wednesday, April 10th. The poster details mechanism of action data that demonstrates the Company’s Decoy platform successfully induces, matures or activates multiple immune cell types involved in anti-tumor responses. The latest findings significantly enhance the Company’s understanding of its “Decoy” platform technology, which uses killed, non-pathogenic bacteria engineered to activate the immune system to attack tumors. The study highlights the platform's effectiveness in engaging key innate and adaptive immune cells, including, natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, dendritic cells, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells. In some settings, the platform also produced additive or synergistic activity in combination with IL-2, an approved cancer drug. Additionally, the data reveal that the Decoy platform may not only boost the immune system's ability to recognize and kill tumor cells, but potentially also overcome a mechanism that suppresses the immune response. The results suggest that the Company’s Decoy bacteria can both directly and indirectly prime the immune system to more effectively fight cancer. Dr. Michael Newman, Indaptus’ Founder, Chief Scientific Officer, and lead author, commented, “The new data are consistent with our preclinical animal tumor model studies and provide evidence for our hypothesis that patented Decoy bacteria can activate a wide range of innate and adaptive human immune cells involved in fighting tumors. This aligns with what we’ve observed in our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of Decoy20 – broad immune activation, as evidenced by transiently increased levels of many key cytokines and chemokines following single dose administration. These findings bolster our confidence in Decoy20's potential as a multifaceted immunotherapy.” [The Company recently initiated the multi-dose cohort of its Phase 1 clinical trial in solid tumors.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=24SRXvgJ6cfty84HPEkQXHMg91wkyF9kFQxvXd3Iq6Q4jQyd9FqmlTY7NuGC-EUYDem5GN5yzz01NcNx-rCZCIot701U4C-XbhB5Ikns0qKT1Ck_Wpmbmi2zoHmc5q2sRzjstBcXp7Jh8GmEZTN90PEcLXZdew_6UXJ3H71_MnJpXAhUj2uOHGFX6ZeEg93ymuo0cCRqIR45J_X6k20L_3JBieliyPA-G5rlUoFzjWHrG9KE6Z6iUb3VdIelzmre2f98lL_mmeAWcxd8sDzKhg==) Jeffrey Meckler, Indaptus’ Chief Executive Officer, added, “We are encouraged by the promising results observed in our preclinical studies and our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial. The recognition and validation from prestigious organizations such as the AACR, coupled with the support and insights we are receiving from medical experts, partners and investors at the conference, inspire us to continue advancing our technology and demonstrating its significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of solid tumors.” The full poster can be accessed on the Indaptus Therapeutics website by clicking [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=EgM8F6sfiAXPqIgAWIp_h_du6JKOKWmHwfvErlu3fuLC2gfROZgg0pMH9IdKPkQeGQEHMWF-FIT0_lJkeUtv9aSLLOoRTdZeAY0OVYXXXjLLxuRsyzrUdPKZLIBsLzVChR2j8X6GACZFgeg0WddAmAgNfgko3Sh3Q30__DztL7I=). About Indaptus Therapeutics Indaptus Therapeutics has evolved from more than a century of immunotherapy advances. The Company’s novel approach is based on the hypothesis that efficient activation of both innate and adaptive immune cells and pathways and associated anti-tumor and anti-viral immune responses will require a multi-targeted package of immune system-activating signals that can be administered safely intravenously (i.v.). Indaptus’ patented technology is composed of single strains of attenuated and killed, non-pathogenic, Gram-negative bacteria producing a multiple Toll-like receptor (TLR), Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) and Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist Decoy platform. The product candidates are designed to have reduced i.v. toxicity, but largely uncompromised ability to prime or activate many of the cells and pathways of innate and adaptive immunity. Decoy product candidates represent an antigen-agnostic technology that have produced single-agent activity against metastatic pancreatic and orthotopic colorectal carcinomas, single agent eradication of established antigen-expressing breast carcinoma, as well as combination-mediated eradication of established hepatocellular carcinomas, pancreatic and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas in standard pre-clinical models, including syngeneic mouse tumors and human tumor xenografts. In pre-clinical studies tumor eradication was observed with Decoy product candidates in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint therapy, low-dose chemotherapy, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or an approved, targeted antibody. Combination-based tumor eradication in pre-clinical models produced innate and adaptive immunological memory, involved activation of both innate and adaptive immune cells, and was associated with induction of innate and adaptive immune pathways in tumors after only one i.v. dose of Decoy product, with associated “cold” to “hot” tumor inflammation signature transition. IND-enabling, nonclinical toxicology studies demonstrated i.v. administration without sustained induction of hallmark biomarkers of cytokine release syndromes, possibly due to passive targeting to liver, spleen, and tumor, followed by rapid elimination of the product. Indaptus’ Decoy product candidates have also produced significant single agent activity against chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in pre-clinical models.
