  "text": "Priyanka Gandhi Urges Swift Action for Assam Flood Relief Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has called for expedited relief efforts and compensation for flood-affected people in Assam. The state faces severe flooding, impacting over four lakh individuals across multiple districts. Major rivers are above danger levels, and the death toll has reached 36. [PTI](/pti-stories)| New Delhi | Updated: 21-06-2024 17:17 IST | Created: 21-06-2024 17:17 IST - Country: - India In a strong appeal for urgent action, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra urged the Assam government to expedite relief and rescue operations for the flood-hit regions. She also stressed the need for compensation to families of the deceased. Officials reported on Friday that the flood situation in Assam remains dire, with more than four lakh people affected in various districts. Rivers like Kopili, Barak, and Kushiyara are surpassing danger levels. Gandhi's plea came in a Hindi post on X, where she noted the devastation and loss of life, urging both the state government and Congress members to assist those impacted. The relentless rains have intensified the crisis, with the state's death toll from floods, landslides, and storms now at 36.
