  "text": "A new clinical trial has recently been published in The BMJ, which demonstrates that administering a single, low dose of esketamine immediately after childbirth can significantly reduce major depressive episodes in individuals who experience depressive symptoms during pregnancy.\nThis study, led by Shuo Wang, MD, from the department of anesthesiology at Peking University First Hospital in Beijing, China, specifically focused on women with pre-existing prenatal depression, which is a group at high risk for postnatal depression.\nThe results showed that a single low dose of esketamine injection after childbirth reduced major depressive episodes by about three-quarters, with a longer-lasting effect in mothers with prenatal depression compared to the general population with depression.\nTo explore the impact of esketamine on postpartum depression in mothers with prenatal depression, researchers in China and the U.S. conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at five tertiary care hospitals in China from June 19, 2020, to August 3, 2022.",
