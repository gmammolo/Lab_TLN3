  "text": "US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida have announced that a Japanese astronaut will be the first non-American human to travel to the lunar surface. In a statement from NASA, it was revealed that this milestone is part of a new agreement signed between NASA and the Japanese government to promote sustainable human exploration of the Moon.\nAs part of the agreement, Japan will design, develop, and operate a pressurized rover for crewed and unmanned exploration of the Moon. The rover will allow astronauts to travel further and conduct scientific research in geographically diverse areas by serving as a mobile habitat and laboratory for astronauts to live and work for extended periods. It will be capable of housing two astronauts for up to 30 days while they traverse the area near the lunar South Pole. NASA plans to use the pressurized rover on Artemis VII and subsequent missions for approximately 10 years.\nIn addition to the lunar exploration agreement, NASA and Japan will expand their collaboration to include Japan’s participation in NASA’s Dragonfly mission to Titan and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. The two countries will also work together on JAXA’s SOLAR-C, a next-generation solar observation satellite that will investigate the mysteries of solar atmospheres.\nFurthermore, NASA will provide an opportunity for a Japanese astronaut to serve as a Gateway crew member on a future Artemis mission. Japan will contribute to Gateway by providing environmental control and life support systems and cargo transport services.\nThis collaboration between NASA and Japan marks a significant milestone in furthering human exploration of space, with the goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon and beyond.",
