  "text": "PITTSBURGH , April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- \"I'm a teacher and I thought there could be a better marker that wouldn't dry out and would allow you to use every last drop of ink,\" said an inventor, from Noblesville, Ind., \"so I invented the BRUCE LIQUID WASHABLE MARKERS. My design would also allow you to easily tell how much ink is left.\"\nThe patent-pending invention provides an improved design for felt-tip markers. In doing so, it offers an alternative to standard markers with a felt storage medium. As a result, it prevents the marker from drying out, even if the cap is left off, and it eliminates the need to prematurely discard and replace markers. The invention features a simple design that is easy to use so it is ideal for households, children, teachers, office workers, etc. Additionally, it is producible in a variety of sizes and colors.\nThe original design was submitted to the Indianapolis sales office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers. For more information, write Dept. 22-CIL-3106, InventHelp, 100 Beecham Drive, Suite 110, Pittsburgh, PA 15205-9801, or call (412) 288-1300 ext. 1368.
