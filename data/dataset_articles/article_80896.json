  "text": "Apr 11, 2024, 10:41 PM IST Estrogen is the main female sex hormone that has many functions. It plays a key role in the female reproductive system. Eating certain foods, rich in phytoestrogen, can increase estrogen levels in your body. Phytoestrogens may function similarly to estrogen. Soybean: It is rich in phytoestrogens known as isoflavones which can produce estrogen-like activity in the body. Dried fruits: Dates, prunes and dried apricots are potent sources of phytoestrogens. Flax seeds: They are rich in lignans, chemical compounds that function as phytoestrogens. Sesame seeds: They are also rich in phytoestrogens and have other health benefits too. Peaches: Packed with vitamins and minerals, they are also rich in phytoestrogens known as lignans. Berries including strawberries and blackberries are loaded with vitamins, minerals and phytoestrogens. Tofu: It is made from coagulated soy milk and is a rich source of phytoestrogens.
