  "text": "In 1999, Benchmade shook up the pocket knife space with the debut of its first-ever AXIS lock-equipped model with the 710. And with 25 years having passed since the 710’s debut, the\nOregon City outfit has opted to mark the occasion via a special run of modernized, re-mastered 710 knives crafted from a super premium material selection.\nThough it largely stays true to the original 710 design from two-and-a-half-decades-ago, the new Seven | Ten lineup jettisons the original knife’s D2 and G10 constructions in favor of more contemporary — and markedly more top-shelf — machined aerospace-grade anodized 6061-T6 aluminum scales and a 4-inch recurve drop point blade offered in CPM MagnaCut or CPM S90V. Spanning 8.95” overall, both the MagnaCut and S90V versions also see the original 710’s FRN backspace replaced with a knurled aluminum item. Made in America and backed by a lifetime warranty, both aluminum handle Seven | Ten models also benefit from a redesigned take on\nBenchmade’s signature AXIS lock.\nWhile there’s no denying how special these two aforementioned Seven | Ten releases are, Benchmade has nonetheless opted to give its most discerning customers the option to acquire an even rarer, and more elite 710 tribute. This ultra-top-shelf version is legitimately made from some of the finest materials currently available to the knife making world. For starters, its handle is crafted from 6AL-4V titanium and features a black DLC-coating and a super ornate backspacer design — along with the same redesigned AXIS lock present on the MagnaCut and S90V versions. Rather than using a CPM metal, the titanium-scaled Seven | Ten gets a super-premium Fafnir-pattern Damascus steel blade courtesy of Sweden’s Damasteel. This beautiful layered blade is also deployed via a specially-machined set of thumb-studs that, like the backspacer, sport a unique and ornate design.\nThe Benchmade Seven | Ten knife lineup is available for order now, with pricing starting at $600 for the aluminum and MagnaCut version, and going up to $1,500 for the titanium and Damascus variant.",
