  "text": "Metacade , a platform specializing in blockchain gaming, is making significant progress by incorporating multi-chain functionality into its ecosystem.\nWith extensive knowledge in the field of blockchain, this Omni-layer development offers a solution to the problem of blockchain fragmentation. It enables builders to work seamlessly across different chains, expanding the reach of blockchain applications.\nThe seamless integration of the Metacade Tournament Platform with the Base Layer 2 Rollup within 12 hours demonstrates Metacade’s technical expertise and dedication to providing top-notch solutions for partners and players.\nWith a deep understanding of blockchain technology, Metacade is committed to building the most expansive Web3 gaming platform, rooted in the principles of an open market.\n“We recognize that speed and low transaction costs are crucial for builders. However, game development hinges on intricate blockchain solutions,” states CEO Russell Bennett. “For Metacade to achieve genuine inclusivity, our success depends on an adaptable infrastructure, regardless of the blockchain utilized.”\nWith a deep understanding of blockchain technology, the multi-chain approach considers scalability for partner road maps. This approach enables existing projects to stay on their native chain while ensuring platform security through an optimistic-based rollup.\nStarting with a vision to connect Web3 game developers with experienced players, a movement has emerged to unite games across different chains and offer seamless liquidity. This movement aims to create more economic opportunities for both builders and players.\nTrading assets will be easier, more efficient, and liquidity will be better accessible with a multi-chain architecture. Regardless of the location of their liquidity core, it provides a smooth on-ramp for gaming partners to enable the use of their tokens.",
