  "text": "Judd Hill Foundation partners with UAMS to provide better care for cancer patients JONESBORO, Ark. (KAIT) - The Judd Hill Foundation has joined hands with UAMS Northeast Regional Campus to improve the healthcare services for cancer patients in the region. Today, the mayor and many other important personalities gathered at the UAMS Family Medical Center to celebrate this new partnership. As part of this partnership, [the foundation has pledged $1 million](https://www.kait8.com/2024/04/11/foundation-pledges-1-million-nea-cancer-care/) to establish the Judd Hill Foundation Fund for Excellence at the UAMS Northeast East Campus. The chancellor at the University of Arkansas has mentioned that this fund will create a better relationship between healthcare for cancer patients and the people of Northeast Arkansas. “This means a better partnership with the people of Northeast Arkansas this means a connection between UAMS and our partners St Benard’s & Nea Baptist it means an opportunity to better serve and save Arkansas,” said Cam Patterson, chancellor at the University of Arkansas. This partnership will bring healthcare for cancer patients closer to home, so they will not have to travel to Little Rock. “What I’m really grateful for though it brings research right here to Northeast Arkansas, so where the residents of Jonesboro and the surrounding communities don’t have to go for further treatment they can stay right here in Jonesboro,” said Jonesboro Mayor Harold Copenhaver. The fund will also be used to provide cancer patients with more support and connect them with resources and local healthcare providers.
