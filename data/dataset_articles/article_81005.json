  "text": "A Japanese astronaut is about to make lunar history! US President Joe Biden shared that a Japanese astronaut will be the first non-American to walk on the moon in an upcoming NASA Artemis mission. At a press conference with Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Biden mentioned that two Japanese astronauts will join upcoming American missions, with one making history as the first non-American to land on the moon.\nNASA NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a blog, \"America no longer will walk on the Moon alone. With this new rover, we will uncover groundbreaking discoveries on the lunar surface that will benefit humanity and inspire the Artemis Generation.\" Japan's Prime Minister Kishida praised this as a 'huge achievement' and revealed Japan's commitment to provide a rover for the program.\nWhat Is Pressurized Rover Provided By Japan?\nJapan's rover will be pressurized. This means it will allow astronauts to travel longer distances and work for extended periods in diverse geographical areas on the moon's surface. NASA confirmed that it will accommodate two astronauts for up to 30 days, enabling them to live and work for extended periods while exploring the region near the lunar South Pole. NASA's current plan is to use the pressurized rover on Artemis VII and subsequent missions over an approximate lifespan of 10 years.\nAbout NASA Artemis II Mission\nIt must be noted that so far, only 12 people have been to walk on the moon through NASA's Apollo program from 1969 to 1972 and all of them were American. The U.S. Artemis program aims to send astronauts back to the moon by as early as late 2025, with the initial landing planned for its third mission in 2026. The Artemis 2 crew, consisting of four members, includes the first woman, the first person of colour, and the first non-American to journey to the moon, who happens to be Canadian.\nThe four astronauts who will fly around the moon for the Artemis II mission are:\nJeremy Hansen, mission specialist - the first Japanese astronaut to walk on the Moon\nVictor Glover, pilot\nReid Wiseman, commander\nChristina Hammock Koch, mission specialist.",
