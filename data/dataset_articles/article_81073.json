  "text": "Simply Wall St. Why Ever Glory United Holdings Limited (Catalist:ZKX) Looks Like A Quality Company Read full article editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) April 12, 2024 at 1:35 AM · 3 min read\nOne of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Ever Glory United Holdings Limited ( Catalist:ZKX ).\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\nView our latest analysis for Ever Glory United Holdings\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity? ROE can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ever Glory United Holdings is:\n61% = S$6.8m ÷ S$11m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each SGD1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made SGD0.61 in profit.\nDoes Ever Glory United Holdings Have A Good ROE? Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Ever Glory United Holdings has a higher ROE than the average (14%) in the Construction industry .\nroe That's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. You can see the 5 risks we have identified for Ever Glory United Holdings by visiting our risks dashboard for free on our platform here.\nHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity? Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\nStory continues Combining Ever Glory United Holdings' Debt And Its 61% Return On Equity Although Ever Glory United Holdings does use debt, its debt to equity ratio of 0.11 is still low. Its ROE is very impressive, and given only modest debt, this suggests the business is high quality. Careful use of debt to boost returns is often very good for shareholders. However, it could reduce the company's ability to take advantage of future opportunities.\nConclusion Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. Check the past profit growth by Ever Glory United Holdings by looking at this visualization of past earnings, revenue and cash flow .\nBut note: Ever Glory United Holdings may not be the best stock to buy . So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.
