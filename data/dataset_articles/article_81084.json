  "text": "Antoine Griezmann was spotted with a stunning smartphone during the Champions League match, and it didn’t go unnoticed.\nSource: Last night, during the Champions League match between Atlético de Madrid and Borussia Dortmund, football fans were able to see Antoine Griezmann with a rather astonishing smartphone in hand.\nAs Numerama points out, this is Oppo’s latest model, the Find champions.\nSource: But why has such a smartphone sparked so many amused reactions on social networks? Quite simply because it has an atypical look, and because Oppo is no longer distributed in France, at least for the moment. The Chinese brand is preparing its big return to France.\nThe Find X7 Pro, high-end Android The Find X7 Pro is very high-end and rather atypical, including two periscope cameras, a world first.\nThe first camera, with a 3x zoom, is based on a 1/1.56 inch sensor, while the second, with its 6x optical zoom, has a 1/2.51 inch sensor. In total, the Find X7 Ultra sports four 50-megapixel cameras on the back, all orchestrated by Oppo’s new HyperTone picture engine.\nOppo Find X7 Ultra On a technical level, the Find wire, and a 6.82-inch screen offering 1440p definition, a 120Hz refresh rate and a maximum brightness of 4,500 nits for HDR content.",
