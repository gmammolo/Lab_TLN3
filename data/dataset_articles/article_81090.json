  "text": "When you’re moving through the wilderness, having the right gear helps keep your mind and body free to experience nature without unnecessary distractions. As the foundation of your gear, a comfortable, technically sound pair of hiking boots can set you up for an experience to remember.\nOur team has years of experience hiking and backpacking through a wide range of landscapes, and we’ve become quite picky when it comes to finding the best hiking boots. We’re especially keen on boots that maximize comfort while meeting technical requirements to help keep your mind on the objective at hand.\nCurrent author and Senior Editor Chris Carter has tested over 20 different pairs of boots in the past year alone, and has his finger on the pulse of the hiking boot market to bring you the most current, deserving selection possible. An alumnus of each of the Triple Crown trails in the United States (PCT, CDT, and AT), Chris has racked up enough blisters over thousands of miles in brutal terrain to know what makes a hiking boot worth its mettle. He’s fastidiously choosy about the footwear he depends on in the backcountry, and allows only the very best into this roundup.\nThrough the testing process, we primarily focused on comfort, traction, support, and durability. Secondary factors included value, style, and weight. After years of hiking and months of testing the newest options out there, we’ve compiled a list of what we truly believe to be the best hiking boots for men and women.\nBecause all feet are unique, there’s no single boot that works for every hiker. We’ve divided this list into categories to help you find the best boot for you. For more help choosing the right boot, we’ve included a complete\n[buyer’s guide](#guide) along with a handy [comparison table](#chart) and [FAQ](#faq).\nEditor’s Note: For our April 11th, 2024 update, we had the opportunity to test the new\nKeen Targhee IV. This comfy and supportive boot is our new best budget pick. At well under $200, the Targhee is durable, waterproof, and a great bang for your buck.\nThe Best Hiking Boots of 2024\n- Best Overall Hiking Boots:\nSalomon X Ultra 4 Mid GTX\n- Best Budget Hiking Boots:\nKeen Targhee IV\n- Best Hiking Boots for Narrow Feet:\nSCARPA Rush 2 Mid GTX\n- Best Hiking Boots for Backpacking:\nSalomon Quest 4 GORE-TEX\n- Best Fast and Light Hiking Boots:\nHOKA Speedgoat 5 Mid GTX\n<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=10248&pw=7185&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F200236%2Fsalomon-x-ultra-4-mid-gore-tex-hiking-boots-mens&ctc=gjbgfootwearhikingboots\">\nSalomon X Ultra 4 Mid GTX </a>\nSpecs\n- Weight 1 lb. 14.4 oz.

We’ve hiked along gradual city park paths and backpacked through rugged alpine terrain on our search for the best hiking footwear on the market. The recommended boots on this list are the result of our thorough and never-ending field testing.\nEditorial Director Sean McCoy broke trail with this guide back in July 2020, crafting our initial selection of eight worthy hiking boots. Whether packing out a kill from deep in the backcountry, or clocking miles on cruiser singletrack — Sean is intimately aware of the importance of proper footwear for streamlined adventures.\nSenior Editor Chris Carter took over this guide in August 2022. He has been combing through his stinky shoe rack, scrubbing through online hiking forums, and endlessly bugging his dirtbag backpacking buds ever since to narrow in on the succinct list of 16 boots you see today. Chris has thru-hiked the Triple Crown of long trails in the United States: the Pacific Crest Trail, the Continental Divide Trail, and the Appalachian Trail. He knows the importance of properly fitting, comfortable boots for long backpacking trips, and is extremely particular about the footwear he depends on in the wild.\nWhen we assess a boot for its durability, we wear it regularly and keep a close eye on long-term performance. When we test a boot for support and stability, we trudge through rough terrain and pay extra attention to ground feel and roll resistance. Our waterproofing testing involves exposure to puddles, precipitation, and other elements that you’re likely to encounter on the trail.\nOur recommendations are not fixed in time. As new hiking boots hit the market, we’ll be waiting to put them to the test. If they’re exceptional, we’ll be sure to add them to this list of the best hiking boots on the market.\nBuyer’s Guide: How to Choose a Pair of Hiking Boots\nChoosing the optimal hiking boot is an ever-complicated and personal endeavor. We all have unique foot shapes and needs on the trail, so research and testing are often critical in finding boots with that perfect blend of fit and function.\nBoots built for durability and stability tend to be less forgiving than most footwear. And because you’re often wearing them for hours on end, they require a more precise fit. Here are a few things that can help you find the best boot for your foot.\nHiking Boot Components: Uppers, Midsoles, and Outsoles\nHiking boots — and\nhiking shoes — are composed of three main components: the upper, midsole, and outsole. The design of each element helps dictate how durable, breathable, and water-resistant the boot is going to be.\nUpper\nA hiking boot’s upper is the outer material on the top and sides of the boot. There are a handful of materials commonly used in hiking boot uppers, but generally, uppers are either leather or synthetic.\nLeather uppers are more traditional-looking, and they tend to be highly durable and abrasion-resistant. However, they sometimes require long-term care to prevent cracking and unsightly aging. A perfect example would be the burly, age-defying\nCrispi Nevada GTX.\nSynthetic uppers tend to be lighter than leather. They also tend to dry faster and generally cost less. An example of a synthetic upper would be\nThe North Face VECTIV Exploris 2 Mid FUTURELIGHT.\nTypically, synthetic uppers are not as durable as leather, but modern advances seem to be closing the gap. For those who prefer not to use animal products, synthetic uppers are obviously the way to go.\nMidsoles\nA midsole provides underfoot cushioning and adds structural stability to the entire boot. Stiff boots likely come with a thick and stiff midsole, and most often require a break-in period.\nStiffer midsoles provide the most durability, but because they have less give, can also be harder on the feet. Stiff midsoles are ideal for providing traction on highly technical terrain where foot movement isn’t ideal, such as mountaineering, ice climbing, and movement over variable terrain like talus fields.\nSoft and flexible hiking shoes are built with thinner, more pliable midsoles. Stiff boots can prevent your feet from becoming tired and sore, but flexible boots may be more comfortable and nimble for fast and light hiking, and they tend to prevent blisters.\nModern hikers engaging in long-distance pursuits are finding that softer midsoles provide the balance of technical performance and comfort they need for extended use, turning to boots like the\nAltra Lone Peak All-Weather Mid for their long-distance endeavors.\nMidsoles are generally made from EVA or polyurethane. EVA is lightweight and soft, while polyurethane is firmer and more durable. If you plan to hike long distances with a heavy pack, either is a viable option, but it really depends on your personal needs.\nIf you have weaker arches and require support, stiffer midsoles can prevent unnecessary soreness over long distances. If you’re already used to more minimal, flexible footwear, softer midsoles allow the muscles in your feet to function more as nature intended. PCT hikers, for example, are trending toward softer midsoles that limit blistering and strengthen the feet over time.\nOutsoles\nThe outsoles of hiking boots are made of rubber with varying grades of stiffness and grip. Harder outsoles on stiff boots sometimes include additives such as carbon to reduce weight. While extra-stiff outsoles are durable and good for carrying heavy loads, they can feel slick when hiking off-trail.\nStiff outsoles are ideal for scrambling on steep rock or other situations where traction is integral to safety. Softer outsoles are ideal for packed, heavily trafficked trails where technical terrain is less frequent. A boot that bridges this gap quite well is the\nLa Sportiva Nucleo High 2 GTX.\nAll outsoles include a lug pattern designed to increase traction and grip. Widely spaced lugs are less likely to accumulate mud, while shallow lugs are better for hiking over rocky surfaces.\nSome lug patterns are symmetrical, while others have a degree of asymmetry that’s primarily integrated to reflect the natural contours of the feet through the footfall. Both have varying degrees of stiffness, so choosing the right lug pattern tends to be a personal preference.\nSome outsoles include a heel brake, which can reduce your chances of sliding while descending steep slopes. Most modern hiking boots integrate a heel brake to some degree, as do most running/hiking hybrid shoes.\nTake this into consideration if your backcountry travels are going to take you up and over high-altitude passes or on trails that are particularly steep.\nWeight\nA pair of hiking boots can weigh anywhere from 1.5 pounds to well over 4 pounds. The weight of your boots will depend on their structure and materials.\nGenerally, more robust boots with leather uppers and stiff soles will be heavier (such as the\nVasque Breeze AT Mid GTX), while hybrid synthetic models will be lighter (such as the Altra Lone Peak All-Weather Mid 2).\nThere is always a give and take with weight. So, heavier boots often prove to have higher degrees of waterproofness and long-term durability, though they may not be the most comfortable options.\nSynthetic boots with flexible soles will be lighter and perform more like running shoes. Carrying heavy boots on your feet on long hikes can cause fatigue, but heavy boots also tend to offer more support. As we’ve previously stated, it’s important to know your personal needs and shop accordingly.\nIn the summer months, it’s not uncommon to see people hiking in rugged lugged sandals. Most often, however, it’s not their first rodeo, and they’ve long developed the foot strength to strip weight and transfer more work to the muscles of the feet.\nSupport & Stability\nIf you’re hiking with a heavy load, you’ll most often want some stable and supportive hiking boots. A stiff outsole and midsole in a boot like the\nLa Sportiva Trango Tech GTX add support underfoot. And a nice firm ankle collar supports the ankle joint when missteps over loose ground are a possibility.\nHeavier boots tend to have rigid ankle support, whereas lighter hybrid options tend to have more of a sock-like fit around the ankle. Our ankles are intended to have a certain degree of flex, and some have more stable ankles than others. This is another important factor to consider when choosing the best boot for your feet.\nArch support is another key factor to consider, and also depends on your personal preference and foot shape. Some people have higher, active arches and can use shoes without arch support (like the\nAltra Lone Peak) over long distances without issue.\nMost manufacturers limit the amount of arch support they include in the footbed to accommodate a variety of foot shapes out of the box. If you know you need arch support but don’t necessarily need orthotics, more traditional, rigid boots like the\nLowa Renegade tend to offer more built-in support underfoot.\nTraction\nDifferent lug patterns are designed for different kinds of terrain. Although some boot companies make their own outsoles, Vibram soles are still the standard for high-quality outsoles and maximum traction. Vibram makes a wide variety of soles, from extremely stiff soles for mountaineering and scrambling to more flexible soles for running and hiking on packed trails.\nSome boots include a smooth section of rubber under the toes for smearing on slabs of rock. Other boots have deep lugs built for soft or muddy trails. Most lug patterns work for a variety of terrain, but if you will be hiking in extreme conditions, look for something more aggressive with larger or pointier lugs.\nOn steep and loose terrain, a heel brake is a handy feature. This is the defined spot on the heel that helps prevent slippage when walking downhill.\nThe\nHOKA TenNine running shoe takes a heel brake to the next level, but most hiking boots are much more subtle. These days, anything intended for heavy use on- and off-trail will have some sort of heel brake, but they’re integrated to varying degrees.\nWaterproofing\nIf you’ll be wearing your boots when it’s rainy, snowy, or cold, get a waterproof and breathable pair. They’ll keep moisture out, which will keep your feet comfortable regardless of how many miles you’re ticking off.\nThe trade-off between impermeability and breathability is evident in heavier boots, so consider something lighter weight if your feet will be getting wet but not soaked. Generally, the more waterproof a boot is the heavier and less breathable it will be.\nThere are a few exceptions, however, and modern advances in venting seem to be improving this age-old dilemma, hence our rave reviews of the\nSCARPA Rush 2 Mid GTX.\nIf you’re hiking primarily or exclusively in hot, dry conditions, don’t get a waterproof boot. A membrane-free boot will keep your feet cool and dry, and the release of moisture can help prevent blisters. If you live in the high desert surrounded by mountains, you’ll probably need a summer boot and a shoulder season boot for when moisture adds more variability to the trails.\nBreathability\nAs mentioned above, breathability and waterproofness are tied together, for better or worse. The more waterproof a boot is the less breathable it will be, and vice versa. If you’re hiking in hot, humid environments where you don’t expect to encounter water, a lightweight, ultra-breathable boot is ideal (the regular version of the\nAltra Lone Peak All-Weather Mid 2, for instance).\nWhen your feet don’t air out, you enhance the risk of blisters, callouses, and more serious injuries like trench foot (way more common in older, less advanced boots). Breathability not only means that air can move through and out of the shoe, but it also lets water vapor escape. Dry feet stay warmer in colder temperatures as well.\nGORE-TEX and other waterproof proprietary membranes (such as the FUTURELIGHT membrane on\nThe North Face’s VECTIV Exploris 2) are breathable to a certain degree, but can quickly feel stuffy and sweaty in dry, desert climates. If you’ll primarily be trekking through dry areas, aim for more breathable “water-resistant” liners, like https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=10248&pw=7185&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F217484%2Faltra-lone-peak-all-wthr-mid-2-hiking-boots-mens&ctc=gjbgfootwearhikingboots|xid:fr1692742286289jge‘s eVent material.\nAll modern manufacturers take this into account when designing the best hiking boots, so some element of breathability will be built in. Still, it’s an important consideration for your unique feet (sweaty vs. dry), as swampy/cold feet can truly make or break an outing.\nInsoles\nNot all hiking boot insoles will be a good fit for every foot. Depending on the shape of your foot, you may need to purchase insoles separately. If you have a high arch, look for insoles that cater to this trait specifically.\nOther insoles promote a flatter, more natural footfall, while others can increase the amount of heel-to-toe drop. If your insoles are wearing out faster in a specific spot, it’s a good sign that you should explore a different option.\nToebox Room\nFor hikers who have feet with toes that splay out more than others, or just naturally wide feet, shoes with narrow toeboxes can be uncomfortable over long distances. As the miles stack up on a long journey, your feet will also swell quite a bit, exacerbating the issue. This can lead to blisters, plantar fasciitis, or other foot issues.\nIf you feel like your toes are playing a game of sardines in every hiking boot you try, it may be time to give wide-width shoes a shot, or models that have enlarged toeboxes. Altra is the king of ultra-wide toebox clown shoes, and though they may look silly, they afford you some of the most natural feeling strides of any boot we tested.\nZero-drop, with plenty of space for your toes to breathe with each step, Altra boots leave very little to be desired. We tested the\nLone Peak All-Weather Mid 2 for this guide, but every Altra shoe boasts this roomy feature.\nCrampon Compatibility\nIf you plan to do some major winter hiking or mountaineering, you’ll need boots that work well with\ncrampons. These traction devices are critical for extreme conditions, and they provide traction when crossing steep snow or ice. In general, heavier, stiffer boots are more compatible with crampons.\nThe\nLa Sportiva Trango Tech GTX Boot is a perfect example of a lighter-weight crampon-compatible boot. Micro-spikes are becoming increasingly popular for thru-hikers who prefer to carry less weight while ultralight backpacking, and they tend to work well over more flexible, lighter boots like the Salomon X Ultra 4 Mid GTX.\nFAQ\nThe most comfortable hiking boots are ones that feel good when you put them on before your hike — and that still feel good when you take them off at the end of your hike.\nA very soft boot might feel great to slide into at home, but it might not have enough support or protection to leave you feeling great after a long day on the trail.\nThe best lightweight hiking boots are the ones that fit your foot. Check out\nAltra’s Lone Peak All-Weather Mid 2. We loved them for their feather weight, superb support, and their roomy toebox. If you don’t need a waterproof boot, choose one without a membrane.\nWhether you hike in shoes or boots is a personal preference. Hiking boots give more ankle support, so if you’re carrying a heavy load backpacking, they’re a great choice. But many thru-hikers wear hiking shoes for big adventures, like the Appalachian Trail.\nStructure underfoot matters as much as how high the boot is. Choose a boot or shoe that feels good to wear and gives you confidence when you’re hiking.\nIf you plan to regularly hike in wet and cold environments, it may be wise to get waterproof hiking boots. You may not plan on getting wet, but it’s always a possibility in the outdoors. Waterproof boots make sure you’re prepared for anything. Depending on the weather and season, you may want a pair of\nwinter hiking boots.\nThat said, waterproof boots tend to be hotter and less breathable. So, if you plan to hike in warm and dry conditions such as the desert, waterproof boots are not the best choice.\n[]https://gearjunkie.com/outdoor/hiking/best-hiking-shoes\n<a href=\"https://gearjunkie.com/outdoor/hiking/best-hiking-shoes\">\nThe Best Hiking Shoes of 2024 </a>\nWe tested and ranked the best hiking shoes for men and women for 2024, including top picks from Salomon, Lems, Merrell, SCARPA, and more.\n[]https://gearjunkie.com/outdoor/hiking/best-womens-hiking-boots\n<a href=\"https://gearjunkie.com/outdoor/hiking/best-womens-hiking-boots\">\nThe Best Hiking Boots for Women in 2024 </a>\nWe tested the best women’s hiking boots of 2022 with options for every budget.
