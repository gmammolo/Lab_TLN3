  "text": " Ubisoft Reveals The Rogue Prince of Persia and a Return to the Series’ Roots Suzie Ford April 11, 2024 News , Videos Ubisoft and Evil Empire have revealed The Rogue Prince of Persia along with the news that it’s coming to Steam early access in May. Players will note that the game is returning to its 2D action-platforming roots mixed with a smattering of roguelite flair. Early access is expected to kick off on May 14th. However, fans who’d like to apply for alpha testing can do so by visiting the official site .\nThe reveal trailer offers a stylized introduction to the story along with a small amount of gameplay. With its cartoon-like graphics, the game is sure to appeal to fans of the original games.\nFeatures include A Persia in Peril : Lead the Prince in his fight against a Hun army corrupted by dark shamanic magic and find your place in the royal family as you explore a vibrant reinterpretation of Persia. Put the pieces of the puzzle together and discover new areas as you enter the fight, again and again, meeting a cast of colorful characters through non-linear story progression. Become The Prince of Persia : Flow seamlessly between platforming and combat, using your acrobatic moves to outmaneuver and outsmart your enemies. Use the iconic wall-run to open new routes of attack, avoid traps, and explore hard-to-reach areas. Kick and dodge to manage groups of enemies when the odds are against you. Adapt and Improve on the Run : Choose from a variety of deadly weapons and equip new medallions each run to unleash devastating effects. This gives you the freedom to change your fighting style as you wish. Secondary weapons offer even more options, from bows to shields to grappling hooks. Switch your loadout mid-run to adapt to new challenges. Rise to Meet the Challenge : Unlock new weapons & medallions and learn from your mistakes to become more powerful with every death. New challenges await you each time as every level is procedurally generated, so no two runs are ever the same.\nCheck out the official site for The Rogue Prince of Persia for more details and to sign up for alpha testing. You can wishlist the game on Steam .",
