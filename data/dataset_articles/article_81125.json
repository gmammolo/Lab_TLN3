  "text": "- More WA public schools to receive further bandwidth increases - Boost will enable faster internet speeds, better video conferencing capabilities and more reliable connections in all schools, but particularly in remote and regional schools - Some schools may receive up to a 200 per cent uplift in bandwidth More Western Australian public schools will receive an additional upgrade to their internet bandwidth capacity, increasing teaching and learning opportunities for staff and students. The Cook Labor Government today announced upgrades to a further 200 schools, bringing the total to more than 700 schools since the project was announced last year. Software upgrades will be carried out first, with bandwidth upgrades expected to be completed during 2024 and 2025. This recent bandwidth boost will provide significant benefits to schools, but particularly remote and regional schools, with some set to receive up to a 200 per cent uplift in bandwidth. The increase will allow staff and students to participate in online classes, access additional online learning resources and work with their peers more effectively. This additional capacity builds on massive public school bandwidth upgrades already delivered across WA, enabling schools that previously had limited bandwidth to use technologies including high-definition multimedia content, as well as running simultaneous online learning and activities in a number of classrooms without lag. As stated by Education Minister Dr Tony Buti: \"We want to ensure students and staff in WA have access to the best learning environments. \"This agreement with Telstra provides another significant increase to overall bandwidth capacity for WA public schools, which is a fantastic outcome students and teachers. \"Bandwidth upgrades are important for schools to support the learning and teaching of students and staff and I am sure schools will be pleased with the increased capacity and all of the opportunities it presents.\" [here](/faster-internet-for-hundreds-of-wa-public-1213576/).",
