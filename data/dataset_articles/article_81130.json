  "text": "By () ,\n5 hours ago\nA 16-year-old student at BASIS Mesa won a Junior Achievement of Arizona award for her work in fostering multicultural and political engagement.\nSascha Reveron received the award in Junior Achievement of Arizona’s 18 under 18 category, which recognizes 18 students under the age of 18 for their work in the classroom, community and beyond. The winning students exemplify this through a variety of methods whether it be volunteer work, forming a nonprofit, research projects, starting a business and many more, according to a press release.\n“They’ve started businesses and nonprofits, broken glass ceilings, volunteered or advocated for a cause,” the press release said. “They all have something in common: They are not waiting until they are adults to make a difference in the world. These Arizonan students distinguish themselves with their creativity, passion and drive.”\nThe nonprofit gives the award to students across the state, with Reveron being the lone recipient from Mesa. She formed a multicultural coalition at her high school as well as founding a youth summit for political engagement, earning her the honors.\n“A true trailblazer, Sascha founded a multicultural coalition at her high school. She wants to create a platform to celebrate and embrace rich cultural backgrounds, foster unity and spark positive change,” the release said. “Additionally, she founded TEENgage, a youth summit for political engagement, and was named ‘Miss Juneteenth Arizona 2023.’”\nAccording to the release, Reveron and the other 17 winners of the award exemplify the bright future that Arizona has.\n“These students are excelling in the classroom and community,” said Katherine Cecala, CEO of Junior Achievement of Arizona. “Each year, we’re amazed by what they have accomplished in such a short period of time. It gives us hope that our future generations are going to be strong leaders who care deeply about the world around them.”",
