  "text": "Where will Clemson football's Nate Wiggins go in 2024 NFL draft? Here are top 5 landing spots CLEMSON — [Clemson football](https://www.greenvilleonline.com/sports/clemson/)'s top prospect in this NFL draft class is cornerback Nate Wiggins. The 6-foot-2, 182-pounder defensive back recorded three interceptions, two forced fumbles, 22 pass deflections and 58 tackles as the Tigers' two-year starter in 23 games. At the NFL scouting combine, he ran the [40-yard dash in 4.28 seconds,](https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/sports/college/clemson/2024/03/01/nate-wiggins-40-time-injury-hip-clemson-football-nfl-draft-combine/72809347007/) fastest among the cornerbacks. Wiggins is a lengthy, physical cornerback who has natural instincts in reading quarterback and receiver clues. He also has an eye for the football, leading the Tigers in pass deflections in back-to-back years. Here are the top five destinations for the projected first-round pick: Nate Wiggins NFL draft projection 1: Philadelphia Eagles The Eagles' defense regressed, a year removed from making the Super Bowl. They allowed the second-most passing yards per game last season (252.7), and their best cornerbacks, Darius Slay and James Bradberry, are in their 30s. Wiggins would add a shot of youthful talent to their secondary if they select him with the 22nd overall pick. He has the physicality, speed and skills to be an early contributor. Nate Wiggins NFL draft projection 2: Jacksonville Jaguars In a quality quarterback-heavy conference and division, the Jaguars need to shore up their secondary. Tyson Campbell is in the final year of his rookie contract, and veteran Ronald Darby signed a two-year deal. As a result, they need a long-term cornerback who can shut down opposing teams' wide receivers. Wiggins would join former Clemson standouts Trevor Lawrence and Travis Etienne if Jacksonville selects him with the 17th pick. Clemson's top prospect would become a starting cornerback on the outside for a Jaguars team that allowed 239.8 passing yards a game, which ranked 26th in the NFL. Nate Wiggins NFL draft projection 3: Indianapolis Colts The Colts had one of the youngest secondaries in the NFL last season, and it showed in the final four games, with the defense ranked 30th in opposing QB completion percentage (68.9%). They re-signed veteran Kenny Moore in free agency to hold down the slot position, but they have unproven corners on the outside with 2023 second-round pick JuJu Brents; 2023 seventh-round selection Jaylon Jones; and 2022 undrafted picks Darrell Baker and Dallis Flowers. Indianapolis drafting Wiggins 15th overall would bring in a potential lockdown cornerback who would add talent in the back end and a crucial building block for the Colts, who haven't won the AFC South title since 2014.

They signed Sean Murphy-Bunting in free agency to hold down one side but need an immediate starter to handle the opposite end. Arizona can add Wiggins with its 27th pick to address the need, or nab him with its 35th overall pick in the second round if he falls. Nate Wiggins NFL draft projection 5: Detroit Lions The Lions, who reached the NFC championship game this past season, will need a boost in their secondary to get back. Despite cutting Cameron Sutton and losing safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson in free agency, they traded for Carlton Davis to strengthen their secondary but need someone opposite him. Detroit can select the best available cornerback with the 29th pick, and if Wiggins is there, he is a logical choice to fulfill its need.
