As such, delving into SEO territory is necessary: search engine optimization is well-established for a reason, and dedicated software to help you with it exists.\nPrograms to analyze your website and offer thorough information about it have been developed to handle the increasing demand for SEO tools, and SEO SpyGlass was made with that principle in mind: it parses your domains to look for backlinks, helping the user better structure their site.\nThis program was developed to crawl one's domain to search for backlinks, and the app manages to offer a wealth of well-structured information for such a complex process. Users shouldn't encounter any problem navigating through the interface: the tab-based layout smooths out the learning curve in getting attuned to a program like this.\nThe Summary tab provides an easily-digestible overview of your chosen domain: graphs providing backlinks and linking domains performance of the last year are front-and-center. The new/lost backlinks and linking domains history just below are also of aid, because they help users see where their website has been linked.\nWhile the Summary view offers valuable data on your website at a glance, accessing the other sections of your domain's Backlink Profile will further help you optimize your site. Backlinks provides the top pages that lead to your domain, and there's even an Anchor Texts feature that shows the hyperlink texts that take people to your website.\nIf you wish to compare your domain with another, the program does a good job to outline the performance differences. For instance, we noticed that our Games section is much more popular than our Windows Software one in all regards, with nearly triple the amount of backlinks.\nSEO SpyGlass is a tool whose value increases with the user's SEO knowledge: in the right hands, this is a powerful piece of software.\nWhat's new in SEO SpyGlass 6.60.13:\n- New Moz API compatibility integrated, fixed the Country factor not updating for all backlinks in SEO SpyGlass.\nRead the full changelog\nSEO SpyGlass 6.60.13add to watchlist add to download basket send us an update REPORT\n- runs on:\n-\nWindows 11\nWindows Server 2022\nWindows Server 2019\nWindows Server 2016\nWindows 10 32/64 bit\nWindows Server 2012 R2\nWindows Server 2012\nWindows 2008 R2\nWindows 8 32/64 bit\nWindows 7 32/64 bit\n- file size:\n- 579 MB\n- filename:\n- seospyglass6.60.13-jdk-x32.exe\n- main category:\nInternet\n- developer:\n-\nvisit homepage 4k Video Downloader ShareX Microsoft Teams Bitdefender Antivirus Free Windows Sandbox Launcher IrfanView 7-Zip calibre paint.net Zoom Client\n- calibre\n- paint.net\n- Zoom Client\n- 4k Video Downloader\n- ShareX\n- Microsoft Teams\n- Bitdefender Antivirus Free\n- Windows Sandbox Launcher\n- IrfanView\n- 7-Zip",
