  "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCTV) - One Tallahassee business is finally opening its doors after going more than a month without power due to last month’s tornadoes that swept through the local areas.\nA Load of Crafts on FAMU Way lost power for 35 days following the tornadoes. The grand opening for the business was pushed back three times, according to the owner Angela Dunlap.\nHowever, Dunlap shared that they had an official opening on May 31 with a generator due to their power still being out.\nAfter weeks of no power, Dunlap said the city came out only to tell her she would have to hire a licensed electrician to fix the ripped power cords in her building.\nMore Tallahassee news:\nDunlap added that she was planning to open just before the storm hit but now, after spending nearly $5,000 to stay float, its been a rough start.\n“It was stressful because we had vendors prior to the storm so I feel like I was letting them down as well as myself because I had a time frame,” Dunlap said. “It was kind of a dark period but now the sun is out and the lights are on so we’re going to move forward.”\nDunlap said she will be sharing her space with other businesses and food trucks that are also still recovering from the tornadoes.\n“I’m hoping to bring more of a community feel I want people to come in and know they can come and hang out with us, do arts and crafts classes with us come on Friday nights when we have our food trucks and enjoy the company of other people,” she added.\nTo stay up to date on all the latest news as it develops, follow WCTV on Facebook and X ( Twitter ).\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction?
