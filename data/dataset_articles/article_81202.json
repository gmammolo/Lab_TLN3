  "text": "Sui (SUI) experienced a significant 45% correction against Bitcoin after a tremendous rally in Q1 this year, according to analyst Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL). However, the analyst suggests this could present an opportunity to buy the dip. What you'll learn 👉 Trend Line Breakdown and Retest Van de Poppe’s chart [reveals](https://x.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1778426527102673204) a downward trendline connecting the highs from June to August. The price has broken down from this trendline. “SUI has seen a tremendous upwards rally in Q1, but since February it has been seeing a 45% correction on the Bitcoin valuation,” he stated. The analyst has marked an ellipse at the bottom right, noting “Potential retest is an entry on the BTC pair.” This implies a retest of this level could offer an attractive entry point for trading the SUI/BTC pair. Invalidation and Take Profit Areas Additionally, Van de Poppe has highlighted key support and resistance zones. A green “Invalidation area” represents a level where a potential long trade would be invalidated if SUI’s price drops below it. Conversely, a red “Potential take profit level” indicates a resistance zone where traders might consider taking profits if the price reaches it after a successful breakout. The analyst’s annotations also include three circles with upward arrows, suggesting areas where SUI’s price broke above prior highs – potential liquidity pool areas. The key?
