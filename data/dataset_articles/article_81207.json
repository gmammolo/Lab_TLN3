  "text": "During the last bull run, many individuals made millions by investing early in projects like Solana ($SOL), Fantom ($FTM), and Polygon ($MATIC), which yielded returns of 1200x, 650x, and 1100x, respectively. For those who missed out on these gains, there are still plenty of new projects with the potential to become the next big winners. In this article, we’ll explore eight early-stage projects that have the potential to deliver over 100x returns in 2024, as shared by analyst [Chain Mind](https://twitter.com/0xChainMind/status/1778077286652137592). What you'll learn 👉 How to Profit from New Projects To maximize your chances of achieving 100x profits from new projects, there are three key strategies to consider: - Farm the project’s airdrop - Participate in the public sale or secure a whitelist spot - Buy during the price discovery stage The market enters a “price discovery” phase after a project launches its token, determining the token’s value without clear alternatives.
