The decision to introduce multi-chain functionality highlights Metacade’s vision to create the largest Web3 gaming platform, grounded in open market principles. “We recognize that speed and low transaction costs are crucial for builders. However, game development hinges on intricate blockchain solutions,” states CEO Russell Bennett. “For Metacade to achieve genuine inclusivity, our success depends on an adaptable infrastructure, regardless of the blockchain utilized.” The multi-chain approach considers scalability for partner road maps, allowing existing projects to remain on their native chain while maintaining platform security through an optimistic-based rollup.

It offers an efficient on-ramp for gaming partners to facilitate the use of their tokens regardless of where the core of their liquidity is situated. This pivotal development future proofs Metacade’s robust, diverse, and accessible ecosystem.
