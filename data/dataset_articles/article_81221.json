  "text": "Retro. Retro never changes.\nBut boy, long-running RPG series sure can! Back when a small group of developers at Interplay Productions released\nFallout in 1997, I’m sure they couldn’t imagine they were setting the foundations for one of the most iconic RPG series of all time. From its humble beginnings as an isometric CRPG to Bethesda’s first-person RPG take on the series, Fallout has gone through several genre and tonal shifts over the years. And with the first season of a brand-new Prime Video TV show coming out, Amazon is set to bring the world of Fallout to our TV screens for the first time.\nThis makes it the perfect time to look back on the long-running series and find out exactly what it was about Fallout that set the RPG world on fire!\nFeaturing: Jonathan Logan, Abraham Kobylanski, Jimmy Turner; Edited by Jonathan Logan\nOpening and ending music by Miles Morkri\nListen and subscribe where you please, and leave a rating if you can!
