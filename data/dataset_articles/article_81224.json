  "text": "Military Times recently [reported](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2024/04/08/military-pharmacies-resume-regular-operations-after-cyberattack/) that military pharmacies are back on-line after the February cyber-attack on Change Healthcare, which forced some beneficiaries to pay full price for prescriptions at Tricare’s in-network retail pharmacies. (Affected patients, if you know any, may [file a claim for reimbursement here](https://tricare.mil/FormsClaims/Claims/PharmacyClaims).) Worldwide, the U.S. military's branches comprise more than 2.8 million people including active-duty members and civilians, who depend upon 154 military treatment facilities pharmacies in the U.S. and abroad, according to the Department of Defense. Related: last week, qAM [reported ](https://ncpa.org/newsroom/qam/2024/04/05/coupons-update-change-healthcare)Change Healthcare also provided information about coupon programs it administers with additional details, including a date-marked downloadable file with drug-by-drug BIN-PCN-Group codes, [available online](https://www.optum.com/en/csp.html). Change Healthcare also reports that the six fee-for-service Medicaid programs it administers have resumed claims processing.
