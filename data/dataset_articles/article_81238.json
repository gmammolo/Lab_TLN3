  "text": "Apple is gearing up to introduce a new chip processor to its fleet of Macs in an effort to boost waning computer sales and spotlight AI.\nBloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter who asked to remain anonymous, said the company may soon\nstart producing the M4 processor, adding that the chip would come in three main varieties. Apple, which has not announced the plans, wants every Mac model to have the chip update, the publication added.\nApple is considering a launch of the updated computers by the end of 2024 and into the beginning of 2025. The new in-house processing chip also comes at a time when Mac’s sales have declined. During the 2023 fiscal year,\nMac sales decreased by 27%.
