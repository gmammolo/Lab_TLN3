  "text": "‘Grandma Dixie’ released from hospital weeks after Greenfield tornado\nBy Pepper Purpura\nClick here for updates on this story\nDES MOINES, Iowa (\nKCCI) — Dixie Dingman, known as Grandma Dixie, was released from Iowa Methodist Medical Center Tuesday after an EF-4 tornado in Greenfield broke her back, 10 ribs, and destroyed her home.\nDingman narrowly escaped death when the tornado hit her home directly on May 21 with her inside. She was buried alive under the rubble of her home before being transported to a local hospital, then Iowa Methodist in Des Moines.\nThe 79-year-old woman spent a week in the ICU, underwent multiple surgeries, and is now recuperating in physical therapy. She credits her recovery to a healthy habit she kept up before the storm hit her home, walking 6 miles daily.\nDingman is now living with one of her daughters to continue healing.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.
