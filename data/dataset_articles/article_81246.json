  "text": "Mercedes-Benz EQS Has More Range And A Nicer Face [Share] The [EQS](https://www.autoguide.com/manufacturer/mercedes-benz/2022-mercedes-benz-eqs-range-test-review-417-miles-in-comfort), perhaps rightfully so, caught a lot of flak for its overly round Chicago-Cloud-Gate shape and odd face. One of those things changes as of 2024, with Mercedes updating the EQS’ looks, specs, and features. The most noticeable change is certainly the new face, which features a more traditional Mercedes emblem on the hood and “fins” across the grille that previously held a load of smaller Mercedes stars. The look is a little more traditional, but from a distance, it gives the EQS a more pronounced face, and we think it helps to assuage some of the criticisms levied at the car’s design when it debuted. The latest EQS sees a renewed focus on rear passenger comfort. Mercedes will offer a new Executive Interior package available on the car’s Pinnacle trim. It features a reclining rear passenger seat and allows the front passenger seat to fold forward for more legroom. Other changes include chrome accenting on the rear b-pillar climate vents and new contrast stitching and leather piping for the rear pillows, because those weren’t bougie enough already. There are more meaningful updates, too. Battery pack size rises from 108.4-kWh to 118.0 kWh. Given that, range increases as well. Mercedes claims an 11% increase in range, or around 50 miles. It’s worth noting these figures could differ slightly, as Mercedes’ figures used the European WLTP cycle to determine the new numbers. We’ll have to see if the EPA’s figures differ in any way. Finally, the automaker updated the EQS’ regenerative braking software to eke out just a little more range. Become an AutoGuide insider.
