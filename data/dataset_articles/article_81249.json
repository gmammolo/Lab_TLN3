  "text": "This stunning spec shows off coachbuilding excellence.\nThe McLaren P1, along with the other two members of the 2010s “Holy Trinity” ushered in a new era of hypercars and made for a turning point in automotive history, proving the full potential of hybrid power and the future of performance. However, a decade after it was first introduced, the McLaren P1 has been given a new look through the coachbuilder Lanzante. The result is the McLaren P1 HDK, with “HDK” standing for “High Downforce Kit.”\nThe HDK version of the McLaren P1 is inspired by the\nMcLaren F1’s available High Downforce Kit, and it not only adds a historical homage and a unique look to the legendary hybrid hypercar, but also better prepares it for on-track excellence. This McLaren P1 HDK is the result of a collaboration between Lanzante and O’Gara Coach, and it features a unique two-tone spec, which was chosen by Paris Mullins, and it’s been shown off in a new Instagram post by Lanzante and O’Gara Coach.\nThe exterior highlights the kit with a two-tone spec, combining satin-finish Supernova Silver paintwork with other parts being finished in exposed carbon fiber. Inside, the interior features another interesting spec, with Hermes Orange leather against black Alcantara. With this spec and its coachbuilt kit, this\nMcLaren P1 HDK shows that a decade-old hypercar still can impress with coachbuilding excellence.\nSource: O’Gara Coach & Lanzante via Instagram",
