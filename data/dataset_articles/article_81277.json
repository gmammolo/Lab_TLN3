  "text": "Construction Equipment Guide\n470 Maryland Drive\nFort Washington, PA 19034\n800-523-2200\nThu April 11, 2024 - National Edition\nIgnite Attachments, a manufacturer of compact equipment attachments, has introducted The Fit Finder tool, a digital tool that allows customers to find the attachments and implements that match compact equipment machine specifications for existing machines with the click of a button.\nIgnite Attachments was the first OEM attachment manufacturer to develop this type of reliable online tool, ensuring customer confidence and satisfaction even in a new digital landscape. With more than 10,000 data points from across all major compact equipment brands, the Fit Finder remains the most robust and user-friendly tool of its kind in the attachment and implement industry, according to the manufacturer.\n\"Online shopping is a staple of the modern economy,\" said Trisha Pearson, business director of Ignite Attachments. \"However, making large purchases online, like attachments, can still be nerve-wracking for many. When we set out to disrupt a stagnant industry, we knew we'd need to develop a tool that takes the guesswork out of attachment ordering and allows customers to shop with confidence. The Fit Finder provides the convenience of online shopping, available when and where it works best for customers, with a precise fit for peace of mind.\"\nPurchasing after-market attachments for existing compact equipment can be a challenging process, especially for customers looking to buy outside the carrier brand. Backed by a database of more than 10,000 relevant specs from across all major models and manufacturers, the Fit Finder eliminates the need for tedious side by side spec comparisons. Customers simply select the make and model of their existing equipment from the tool's drop-down menu. In seconds, customers are served all the Ignite products that perfectly match with the specified carrier. From there customers can either check out the details of a product or simply click \"add to cart.\"\n\"It's as easy as that\" Pearson said. \" Time is money. The more time we can save customers, the more efficient and hassle-free we can make the buying process, the more our customers benefit. The Fit Finder tool can eliminate hours of research. This convenience, paired with our transparent pricing, overall economy and direct-to-you shipping, provides significant savings.\"\nFor more information, visit www.igniteattachments.com.",
