  "text": "All cities in Montenegro have been supplied with electricity so that all consumers are supplied. This was officially announced by the director of the National Dispatch Center, Ranko Redžić, at the press conference of the Montenegrin Electric Transmission System (CGES). He said that at 12.25:XNUMX a disturbance of regional proportions occurred, affecting most of Montenegro, except for the northern municipalities, as well as most of Croatia, Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). \"We have no information about what exactly happened and what led to this, and that will be determined by the European Association of Transmission System Operators, which is part of the European Commission (EC). They will have detailed and precise information after the investigation,\" said Redžić. He could not comment on the allegations of the regional media that Montenegro is allegedly to blame for this event. He explained that it was a regional failure and that the investigation by the official body of the EC will show what happened. He said that he has no information as to why there is no water in some parts of Podgorica, and that CGES delivered electricity to the water stations on time. He also said that the human factor is not the cause of this event and that there is no need to think about it, and that such a disturbance has not happened in Montenegro in the last 30 years. He also explained that the cause could also be the green transition because that market is very active. When asked if the cause of the regional failure happened on the border between Greece and Albania, as reported by some regional media, he replied that all the records should be looked at and that it is possible that this also happened.
