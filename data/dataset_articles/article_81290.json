  "text": "A United States Army officer shares a modified combat rig that could offer service members a more optimized alternative to the traditional TAPS, or tactical assault panel system. In November, we spoke with 1st Lt. Zachary Calderone of the 25th Infantry Division during the Army's Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center, or JPMRC, training exercise in Hawaii. JPMRC is a large-scale 10-day training exercise where the US Army, along with international partners, utilizes realistic combat scenarios that prepare soldiers for battle with peer adversaries like China. Based in Oahu, the 25th Infantry Division typically trains for combat in jungle environments. On this day, Calderone's platoon was operating in the Pōhakuloa Training Area on the island of Hawaiʻi. While the tactical assault panel system is one of the Army's standard combat rigs, Calderone was tasked by his unit to test out a prototype optimized for jungle warfare. Calderone breaks down the differences between what he calls the \"jungle rig\" and the standard TAPS rig, pointing out how the new rig offers superior adjustability and breathability.
