  "text": "Students at Battle Academy have been gearing up for the solar eclipse. Teachers and staff at the school have been preparing all week to make sure students can safely witness and learn from this rare phenomenon.\n2nd and 4th-grade students teamed up together all week to work on solar eclipse projects.\n4th-grade teacher Bre Myers says it's a special moment for the students to get that chance to see an eclipse, and the project they are working on will be a memory they can keep forever.\nShe says the project describes the different stages of the eclipse.\n\"So, it explains the first step, and the second step is the second contact, and that's when nature is affected. Birds will stop singing, and animals will change behavior, and it goes on to explain what the feeling will be about. Then we go from totality and the moon moving away, and the birds will get more active and then back to what we are usually like.\"\nWhile we here in Chattanooga won't see a totality, students learned what it would look like and what would happen in nature if we did.",
