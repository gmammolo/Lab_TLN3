  "text": "The future of health care — including using artificial intelligence, combatting burnout, managing nursing workforce challenges, navigating public policies, forecasting population health, and leveraging technology to enhance the patient experience — was the key theme [Sanford Health](https://www.sanfordhealth.org/?utm_source=news.sanfordhealth.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=shn-traffic&utm_content=article-link) leaders discussed during a series of fireside chats, panels and roundtable discussions at the [Becker’s 14th Annual Meeting](https://news.sanfordhealth.org/news-release/sanford-leaders-to-take-stage-at-beckers-annual-meeting/). Seven of Sanford’s business and strategy leaders led panel conversations and keynotes during the four-day event in Chicago, organized by Becker’s Healthcare. CEOs and other leaders from systems across the country were invited to discuss growth strategies and culture. “One learning point I’m taking away is that AI is really becoming part of our practices,” Sanford Health Chief Medical Officer [Jeremy Cauwels](https://www.sanfordhealth.org/doctors/jeremy-cauwels), M.D., said. “It’s being integrated in ways that are not only intelligent and helping our patients – but also time-saving.” Senior Vice President and Chief Digital Officer [Jared Antczak](https://news.sanfordhealth.org/author/jared-antczak/) said artificial intelligence holds tremendous promise for health care if deployed safely, responsibly and transparently. “There’s so much potential for these advanced technologies but at the end of the day, they’re really only impactful and valuable if they’re designed around the people they’re intended to serve, whether those people are our workforce, clinicians, or patients and consumers,” Antczak told Sanford Health News. Martha Leclerc, vice president of corporate contracting and strategic reimbursement, said the uncertainty in Washington, D.C., is top of mind for many attendees at the conference. Leclerc was invited to speak on the economics and policies shaping the future of health care. “We’re always waiting for that next decision or issue to be resolved,” Leclerc told Sanford Health News. “That trickles down and has a big impact on all of us, especially in the rural setting. “Our conversations have included the fact that we need to continue constantly educating our elected officials, so they really understand the issues we’re facing in the field in delivering health care.” Sanford Health News caught up with each of the leaders to recap their respective panels and conversations they had with other health experts in their fields. Corporate leaders in attendance included: Jeremy Cauwels Emily Griese Erica DeBoer Brad Reimer Jared Antczak Heather Spies Martha Leclerc This is the third consecutive year Sanford Health leaders have taken part in the Becker’s Annual Meeting following its return to an in-person setting after the pandemic.
