  "text": "Eastern Acoustic Works (EAW) has announced the appointment of Raymond Tee as APAC technical sales manager, where he is the primary pre- and post-sales technical support contact for company’s APAC partners in addition to assisting James Bamlett, senior director of EMEA and APAC sales, with identifying, training and managing new partners to strengthen EAW’s network throughout the region.\n“I first worked with Raymond over 20 years ago when he was handling EAW for our Malaysian distributor,” says Bamlett. “With his vast experience in the field, I’m very glad that we are finally able to close the circle and get him back to EAW.”\nTee has held sales, technical and engineering positions at several international manufacturers, was the operations manager at a large rental company and most recently served as Powersoft’s solutions engineer for APAC.\n“With a journey spanning over two decades in the dynamic field of audiovisual (AV) technology, I’ve had the privilege of evolving alongside the industry,” Tee says. “I first worked with the EAW brand at the start of my career as a service technician and am proud to now join the team to use my extensive experience to support APAC sales.”",
