  "text": "By Edith Olmsted ,\n3 hours ago National Geographic/Bertie Gregory For the first time ever, filmmakers for National Geographic have captured the annual rite of passage many baby penguins take before they embark on their first swim: a daring leap from a towering ice shelf.\nThe astounding new footage shows approximately 700 Emperor penguin chicks gathering precariously at the top of a sheer ice cliff, and one-by-one launching themselves into the icy waters 50-feet below.\nThe footage was captured on location at Atka Bay, in Antarctica , by the BAFTA Award-winning cinematographer Bertie Gregory as part of a upcoming National Geographic production called THE SECRETS OF PENGUINS , which will air in April 2025.\nThis first-of-its-kind footage is rare because the ritual only occurs in January, when the sea surrounding the fledglings’ home is at its most volatile.\nThe announcement was a part of National Geographic’s Earth Month promotion, which can be seen as part of the ourHOME collection on Disney+.\nLearn more about the historic penguin leap at NatGeo.com .\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
