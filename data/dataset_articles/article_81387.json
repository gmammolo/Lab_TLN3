  "text": "/PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Radiant Vision Systems, a leading provider of image-based light and color measurement solutions, announces the I16-G, the latest addition to its line of ProMetric® Imaging Colorimeters. ProMetric imaging metrology solutions are used to measure properties of light that influence the visual quality of devices such as LEDs, displays, augmented and virtual reality (AR, VR) projections, and head-up displays (HUD). The benefits of imaging enable ProMetric systems to capture millions of data points simultaneously across a single field of view for extremely rapid measurement cycles. Imaging also enables spatial comparison of data points across the field of view, necessary for evaluating brightness or color uniformity, gradient, contrast, pixel-level variation, random defects, and dimensional accuracy of light source distributions and displays. ProMetric® I family of imaging colorimeters is designed to address the demands of high-volume manufacturing of displays, backlit components, and light sources. Whether expanding test coverage or increasing throughput, ProMetric I delivers the required performance for highly accurate color and luminance measurements in an automated manufacturing environment. Radiant provides the largest selection of imaging colorimeters and photometers, focusing on the specific needs of the customer when it comes to the resolution, features, and price point best suited to them. \"When it comes to light and color measurement solutions, the importance of capturing critical details in any device is essential,\" states Doug Kreysar, CEO of Radiant Vision Systems. \"ProMetric I-series imaging colorimeters, and the electronically controlled lenses supplied with them, are factory-calibrated over all possible distances and two specific aperture settings. Because the lenses are electronically controllable for focus and aperture, the colorimeter will automatically apply the appropriate flat-field correction. This reduces set up time and provides more precise measurements for manufacturers. Additionally, high-speed and high-resolution image sensors, along with a flexible system, helps us evaluate larger regions, while continuing to measure the brightness and color of each individual diode.\" The ProMetric I16-G Imaging Colorimeter uses a scientific-grade, 16.1-megapixel (5312 x 3032) image sensor to provide accurate, repeatable measurements. The resolution of this system enables pixel-level measurement of displays (LCD, OLED, microLED, and others), inter- and intra-character luminance measurement of backlit keyboards and panels, and measurement of LED luminance and color from single diodes to large arrays. This 16.1MP option provides a mid-range resolution option to round out Radiant's I series line which includes options ranging from 2MP to 61MP. New ProMetric Imaging Colorimeters and Photometers build upon the proven imaging performance that has made ProMetric systems a leading choice for manufacturing engineers, display makers, and optical designers for over 30 years.
