  "text": "West Ham United women’s team are delighted to confirm that Kirsty Smith has signed a contract extension with the Club. The Scotland international becomes the third player to extend her contract with the Club this summer after [Dagný Brynjarsdóttir](https://www.whufc.com/news/dagny-brynjarsdottir-signs-contract-extension) and [Viviane Asseyi](https://www.whufc.com/news/viviane-asseyi-extends-contract-west-ham-united). Smith has been instrumental for the Hammers since she arrived in east London from Manchester United in the summer of 2022. The full back has made 54 appearances across the last two seasons. During the 2023/24 campaign, Smith scored her first goal in Claret & Blue in a 2-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion in October and made 25 appearances over the course of the season. The experienced defender also returned to the national team setup in 2023/24, earning her 50th cap for Scotland in a 0-0 draw against Serbia in April. [Renew your Season Ticket now and watch Smith in action again in 2024/25!](https://www.whufc.com/202425-womens-team-season-tickets) Smith expressed her delight in continuing her journey with the Hammers. “I’m really happy to extend my contract at West Ham United,” she told West Ham TV. “I’ve had two great years at the Club and I’m really happy to be continuing this chapter in east London. “I love being part of this team – every time I play for West Ham and for our incredible fans is a privilege. From a personal perspective, I think I have developed as a player since being here and I want to keep working hard to help the team however I can. “I’m already excited to get back to Chadwell Heath for pre-season and I’m looking forward to another season in a West Ham shirt.” Rehanne Skinner shared her delight at Smith extending her stay in east London. “I am delighted that we have extended Kirsty’s contract,” Skinner said. “Kirsty was one of our most consistent players last season. She gives us a different dynamic to our play and provides us with great attacking options from defensive positions. “She is a hard working, experienced person who gives everything to the team and the West Ham badge. I’m sure Kirsty will continue to be a real asset to our back line and have a huge impact on the team moving forwards.” Everyone at West Ham United would like to congratulate Kirsty on her new contract.
