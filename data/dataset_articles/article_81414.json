  "text": "Modern file manager with a keen focus on usability, offering users a number of tools to more handily manage the files on their system.\n#File Manager #Folder Management #Explorer Replacement #File #Manager #Folder\nSoftpedia Review\nspecifications\nchangelog\nFree Download\nbuy now Robert Condorache\nThose looking to manage their files and folders more efficiently often choose to look to third-party software to handle such duties, even though the built-in File Explorer already does a serviceable job. The reasons to look for alternatives are understandable, as they mainly boil down to affording more power-user options to users, with a focus on efficiency.\nIt is thus clear why someone would choose to go down that path. A utility purposely geared to facilitate file management is obviously a proposition hard to pass for someone looking to go more in-depth, and that's what HiFile seeks out to do: provide a modern file manager, with enough functions to satisfy a more discerning user base.\nAiming to improve upon what File Explorer offers, the software comes with a modern design, where reachability is the name of the game. Accessing the program's functions and navigating through its interface feels quite natural, so you'll be able to freely start managing your files in a more focused manner.\nIf you've used other third-party file management solutions in the past, it won't take long for you to attune to this one. Even if you aren't really familiar with software of this kind, there's nothing to worry about.\nYou can start by heading to the directories you want to work on, and begin managing them however you like. The dual-panel layout makes it possible to work on two directories at once, and they can be as related or unrelated as you want.\nThe Search function is quite a robust one. You can specify the general location of a file you want to find, add filters to your search, as well as specify a size and modification date to narrow everything down.\nComparing two directories is likewise possible, and it works as you would expect. This can be especially useful when you're cross-checking directories that contain stills, as images will be previewed for you to see. From the same menu, users can synchronize one directory's data with another.\nSimilarly, if you're looking to cut down on storage, you may first want to take a look at duplicate data. The program can find that data for you, and help you retrieve some valuable storage space.\nThose on the lookout for a competent file manager will be able to find one in HiFile, which also makes for a surprisingly accessible solution.\nHiFile 0.9.9.11add to watchlist add to download basket send us an update REPORT\n- runs on:\n-\nWindows 11\nWindows 10 64 bit\n- file size:\n- 15.1 MB\n- main category:\nFile managers\n- developer:\n-\nvisit homepage Microsoft Teams Bitdefender Antivirus Free IrfanView Zoom Client calibre paint.net Windows Sandbox Launcher ShareX 7-Zip 4k Video Downloader\n- ShareX\n- 7-Zip\n- 4k Video Downloader\n- Microsoft Teams\n- Bitdefender Antivirus Free\n- IrfanView\n- Zoom Client\n- calibre\n- paint.net\n- Windows Sandbox Launcher",
