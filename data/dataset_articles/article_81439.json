  "text": "2K has unveiled exciting details about the gameplay modes and customisation features in the upcoming TopSpin 2K25 game. If you’ve been wondering whether you can play multiplayer with your friends on TopSpin 2K25, the answer is yes – among other things.\nDevelopers Remi Ercolani and Jesse Scott provide an overview of the player journey, starting at the TopSpin Academy where players can master core gameplay mechanics under the guidance of tennis legend John McEnroe. Basic and advanced lessons, as well as playstyle tutorials, prepare players for the challenges ahead.\nFollowing training at the academy, players can engage in Exhibition matches, either offline or online, including singles or doubles with AI or human partners. The game offers cross-platform multiplayer with skill-based matchmaking and plans for future friend matches.\nFor those ready to test their skills further, TopSpin 2K25 offers three main modes: 2K Tour, MyCAREER, and World Tour. In 2K Tour, players select licenced pros and compete online to climb the leaderboard by completing daily challenges. MyCAREER allows players to create custom MyPLAYERs and rise through the ranks by competing in various tournaments, managing fatigue, and customising their appearance and playstyle. Finally, World Tour takes MyPLAYERs online to challenge others, earn Tournament Points, and climb the global leaderboard.\nThe Deluxe and Grand Slam Editions of TopSpin 2K25 will be available on April 23, 2024, with Standard and Cross-Gen Editions launching on April 26, 2024. Pre-ordering the standard edition includes the Under the Lights Pack, featuring alternate outfits for Serena Williams and Roger Federer, the Wilson Nightfall Bundle, and Night-Time Majors.",
