  "text": "SAMSUNG GALAXY WATCH 7 March 25, 2024 at 3:13 p.m\nSamsung could release three variants of the Galaxy Watch 7 instead of the current two. This is what the leaked model numbers suggest. This is how the third model could differ.\nSamsung could release three model variants of the Galaxy Watch 7 instead of the current two. (Source: Samsung)\nSamsung is secretly working on a new generation of smartwatches and it could be bigger than any previous one. The South Korean manufacturer may present three new smartwatches in the coming months. Until now, each model generation consisted of a maximum of two models.\nThe usually well-informed fan blog SamMobile wants to find out about this. The model numbers of the next Galaxy Watch generation were leaked to this by unnamed sources. These are as follows: SM-L300/SM-L305, SM-L310/SM-L315 and SM-L700/SM-L705. The “5” at the end of a model number is intended to indicate the LTE variant, while the “0” stands for the Bluetooth version.\nGalaxy Watch 7 Pro, 7 Ultra or a square watch?\nAccording to SamMobile, it is still unclear what name the individual models will be called. We assume that the “SM-L300/SM-L305” model will be the Galaxy Watch 7 and the “SM-L310/SM-L315” model will be the Galaxy Watch 7 Classic. Finally, the similarity of the model numbers indicates that the watches are very similar. The regular and classic versions essentially only differ in appearance.\nSeveral names are conceivable for the third model. What seems most realistic to us is that Samsung is positioning the model as the successor to the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro. The South Korean manufacturer continues to sell these even after the Watch 6 is released, as the model with its long battery life is primarily aimed at outdoor fans and athletes. It would also be conceivable that Samsung would call the model the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra in the future in order to participate in the success of the Apple Watch Ultra.\nRumors have recently been circulating that Samsung will once again offer smartwatches with a square housing instead of a round one. The third model may also set itself apart from the other Galaxy Watch models thanks to a different form factor.\n” Tip: The best VPN providers for more security and data protection » Buy balcony power plant: Comparison of the best solar systems Don’t miss anything with this NETWORK WORLD Newsletter\nEvery Friday: The most informative and entertaining summary from the world of technology!\nSource link -67",
