We always push the boundaries of what’s possible and take risks to help create the future of sport together,” said John Hoke, Nike’s Chief Innovation Officer. “This summer, the difference maker is the massive energy return that Nike Air delivers to athletes. Taking what we learned from our super-shoe technology, we’re introducing new Nike Air Zoom shapes and sensations across all sports.”\nThe best of Nike’s Air innovation for this summer will debut in the\nNike Blueprint Pack, spanning footwear for track and road racing, basketball, football, skate, breakdancing and lifestyle.

Based on 4D motion-capture data, with pixel-level precision and specifically designed for each competition, the kits were inspired by the distinct identities and diverse communities of each country and sport.\nNike also\nrevealed A.I.R.— Athlete Imagined Revolution. In this co-creation project between elite athletes and Nike designers, Nike used innovative design tools to create the future of Air. The radical concepts are a view into the future of athlete co-creation, as well as the unlimited possibilities of Nike Air.\n“There are now no limits to what we can create with Nike Air,” said Hoke. “We’re obsessing new technologies like AI engines and rapid prototyping to continue exploring the unlimited possibilities. Now we can create Nike products with unprecedented fidelity, velocity and impact.”\n“We’re thrilled to celebrate another summer of sport with our incredible athletes and the product innovations that will help propel them to achieve their dreams,” said Heidi O’Neill, President, Consumer, Product and Brand, NIKE, Inc. “What you’ll see this year on the pitch, court, road or track signals a new, exciting multi-year cycle of innovation for us.
