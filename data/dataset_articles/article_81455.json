  "text": "The Shaanxi Hanfu Trading Center was officially established in Xi'an, the capital of Northwest China's Shaanxi province, on April 8, marking the first of its kind in Northwest China.\nThe center aims to gather numerous clothing enterprises in Shaanxi, striving to strengthen and expand the clothing industrial chain, making it both a trading and an experiential hub for traditional Chinese clothing styles from the Zhou (c.11th century-256 BC), Qin (221-206 BC), Han (206 BC-AD 220), and Tang (618-907) dynasties.\nBy establishing a centralized platform for the exhibition and sale of local hanfu products in Shaanxi, the center will provide a one-stop immersive consumer experience for hanfu enthusiasts.\nLadies wearing hanfu sing elegant songs at the opening ceremony.
