  "text": "High school students from Garden City High School were awarded the title of Medical Marvels in this year's 12th annual science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) research competition, hosted by [The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/about-us) and Northwell Health’s Career Services team. More than 150 first- and second-year high school students from Long Island and New York City wrote research papers and presented novel ways to tackle educational inclusion for people living with disabilities. The winning team was announced on April 10, after the finalists presented their ideas in person at the Feinstein Institutes. Students from 25 schools were tasked with the hypothetical challenge to of addressing improving the schooling experience for people with disabilities, including transportation, accessibility and curriculum. The students envisioned themselves as principals of a large junior high school and had to form a committee to outline innovative solutions to make their school more inclusive. Teams were required to submit a scientific research paper to answer key considerations, including what solutions they would put into place and how to measure success. A panel of scientists, clinicians and healthcare administrators evaluated the submissions and presentations using a five-point scale scoring rubric. The applications were judged for qualities such as innovation, clarity, approach and measurement of success. “Now in our 12th year, we have asked Long Island’s most brilliant young minds to thoughtfully address some of society's most pressing issues, like [human trafficking](https://www.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/human-trafficking-offenses-increase-62-percent) and [gun violence](https://www.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/young-gun-violence-survivors-lasting-trauma), and this year, educational inclusion,” said Lauren Pearson, director of Talent Sourcing at Northwell. “Through the Medical Marvels program, we aspire to ignite the passion of future scientists, engineers, doctors and changemakers, fostering a commitment to improving and making our communities healthier.” The winning students – who will split $1,800 – from Garden City High School included Clara Archer, Anais Bardizbanian, Cailin Gately, Alexandra Gregory, Breckin Kammerer and Giuliana Pamatat. The team proposed the idea of EyeDesk TM, which uses assistive technology, digital learning platforms and AI learning assistants to create a more accessible educational experience for students. Some of the items in the EyeDesk TM included a sensory board, live real-time speech to text, proofreading, facial recognition software, an AI assistant, illuminated buttons and a multi-function surface. “Congratulations to every student who participated in the Medical Marvels competition. Your accomplishments serve as a beacon of inspiration, reaffirming the pivotal role of STEM education in crafting a more inclusive and equitable tomorrow,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). “As these students evolve into tomorrow's innovators, I eagerly anticipate witnessing their transformation into the problem-solvers of our future.” During the in-person event, Senator Gillibrand shared a special pre-recorded message with the students. In addition, leaders across Northwell shared valuable insight around the issue of accessibility and inclusion, including a keynote address from [Chad Bouton](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/chad-bouton), professor at the Feinstein Institutes’ [Institute of Bioelectronic Medicine](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/bioelectronic-medicine). Professor Bouton, internationally known for his groundbreaking work in brain-computer interface technology, shared valuable insight on innovation and persistence in the STEM field. “The high school students of today will emerge as the future leaders in medicine, science, public health and technology,” said [Kevin J. Tracey, MD](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/kevin-j-tracey-md), president and CEO of the Feinstein Institutes and Karches Family Distinguished Chair in Medical Research. “At the Feinstein Institutes, we are honored to welcome and engage with these young Medical Marvels, drawing inspiration from their ingenuity, innovative ideas, and intelligence.” Students from Valley Stream South High School placed second while Jericho High School were third. The second place team will receive a $1,000 scholarship and the third place teams will each receive a $500 scholarship.",
