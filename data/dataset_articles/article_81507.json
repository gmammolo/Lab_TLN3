  "text": "31.6 million inhabitants of various regions of Mexico, the US and Canada can enjoy a total solar eclipse this day that will last more than 4 minutes.\nThe first area of ​​continental North America where totality of the eclipse will be seen will be the Mexican Pacific coast, at around 11:07 am (PDT). The first city in which the phenomenon began to be recorded is Mazatlán, in the state of Sinaloa.\nThe phenomenon will pass through more than 15 US states (from Texas to Maine), cross the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and end on the Canadian island of Newfoundland.\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon comes between the Sun and Earth, completely blocking the solar disk. While the event is taking place, the solar corona is visible to the naked eye.\nOne of the big differences between the 2017 eclipse and today’s is the magnetic activity of the Sun. The star has its own cycle, called the ‘solar cycle’, which lasts about 11 years. During that time, its magnetic activity waxes and wanes. The 2017 eclipse occurred near solar minimum, a low magnetic activity.\nNASA predicts that for the next eclipse there will be solar maximum, which means that there will be a greater chance of seeing streamers in the solar corona, as well as bulges (bright pink curls coming out of the Sun). At the same time, he stressed that it is possible that a coronal mass ejection could be visualized during the eclipse.\n#Total #solar #eclipse #crosses #sky #North #America #Diario #Página",
