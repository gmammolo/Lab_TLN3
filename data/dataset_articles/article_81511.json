  "text": "Grand Theft Auto VI was revealed with an incredible trailer that broke records and delighted all fans of the franchise. Some fans decided to make their own version of the trailer in the locations where Rockstar Games was inspired to create the world of the new installment. The result is a live-action trailer that delighted the community and that, surely, will also bring a smile to the developers of the title. As you can imagine, the project by youtuber Andrew Levitt caught the attention of many and currently already has thousands of views. Youtuber makes live-action version of the first trailer of GTA VI Levitt and his collaborators pored over every frame of the GTA VI trailer, which is full of interesting city details. In this way they searched for and found the places that inspired certain of the scenes in Rockstar's official video. Subsequently, they visited them to make a few recordings. In addition, they recreated the social media posts that appear in the trailer, the driving scenes, the final store robbery, and there is even a special appearance of the Florida Joker. The people who give life to Lucia and Jason, the main characters of the game, did a great job, as they recreate their personalities very well and even add funny details to the video, such as the bananas they use as guns in the final scene. The result surprised all fans of the franchise, who believe that the video captures the essence and atmosphere of GTA VI very well. We won't tell you more and we leave you the live-action trailer below:",
