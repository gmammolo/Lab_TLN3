  "text": "Is what 3 words better than GPS?\nWhat3words offers an alternative to traditional GPS coordinates, providing a simpler and more user-friendly way to communicate and navigate locations. It has its advantages over GPS, but whether it is better depends on individual needs and preferences.\nWhat is criticism of what3words?\nThe main criticism of what3words is that it is controlled by a private business and its software is patented, making it less freely usable compared to GPS coordinates.\nHow accurate is w3w?\nCompared to current street addressing systems, what3words addresses are more accurate as they pinpoint a specific 3m x 3m area. They remain fixed even if buildings or streets are redeveloped, ensuring accuracy.\nWhat is the benefit of using what3words?\nWhat3words addresses are easier to remember, say over the phone, and type. They are designed for speech recognition technology and offer a quicker and easier way to input locations into voice-enabled devices or vehicles.\nDoes anyone use what3words?\nWhat3words is used by individuals, businesses, and NGOs in almost every country worldwide, making it a widely adopted and recognized addressing system.\nDo UK police use what3words?\nOver 80% of UK emergency services, including the police, accept what3words addresses. While some services in other countries also use it, its use is not yet widespread globally. In emergency situations, it is advisable to call 999 and provide the what3words address for accurate location information.\nHow much does it cost to use what3words?\nUsing what3words is free for individuals via the app and online map. However, the company generates revenue by licensing its API to businesses that benefit commercially from using their products.\nHow do you make money with what3words?\nWhat3words monetizes its services by licensing its code for converting what3words addresses into GPS coordinates to businesses. This allows businesses to access what3words functionality through their Public API or Enterprise Suite.\nDoes Google Maps accept what3words?\nWhile Google Maps doesn’t directly integrate what3words, if provided with a what3words location, users can open it in the what3words app and choose to navigate using Google Maps. This allows users to access the exact location in Google Maps and get directions.\nCan I choose my own what3words?\nYes, individuals can choose their own what3words address based on personal preferences or specific points of interest. People often select a combination of words they like or the address of a specific useful location within a 3m x 3m square.\nWhy is what 3 words better than Google Maps?\nWhat3words and Google Maps serve different purposes. While Google Maps is primarily used for navigation and looking up points of interest, what3words excels in providing a simple and precise way to communicate exact locations, making it ideal for voice-enabled devices, phone calls, and typed inputs.\nWhy does my 3 words keep changing?\nIf multiple devices are very close to each other, they may show slight variations in the displayed 3 word addresses. This is because each device may perceive its location slightly differently. The app converts the GPS location into a 3 word address, allowing for minor variations.\nDoes what3words work without phone signal?\nThe what3words app can function without phone signal or data connection. Users can view the location of any what3words address they enter, access satellite mode, and navigate using compass mode. However, phone signal is required to share a what3words address over phone calls or text messages.\nDoes what3words work in the ocean?\nWhat3words offers 3 word addresses for every 3m square in the world’s seas and oceans, available in English and Korean. However, other what3words languages cover land and coastline areas only.\nWho runs what3words?\nWhat3words is owned by its founders, employees, and investors, including Intel Capital, Mercedes-Benz, Sony Innovation Fund, Subaru, Aramex, Deutsche Bahn, Ingka Investments, ITV AdVentures Invest, and Channel 4 Ventures.\nWhat is the longest what3words address?\nAverage what3words addresses consist of 23 characters, but the maximum length can be up to 64 characters. However, before sharing a real address, it is essential to obtain permission and ensure its legitimacy.\nWhat three words to postcode?\nConverting a postcode to a what3words address is not accurate as postcodes represent a larger area compared to the 3m square identified by a what3words address.\nHow do I find a location using what3words?\nTo find a location using what3words, enter a place name or street address into the search bar and verify the correct result. Switch to satellite mode and zoom in until the grid becomes visible. Tapping on a square in the grid reveals its corresponding what3words address. The app also allows users to view their current location.\nWhat is not allowed on Google Maps?\nGoogle Maps has strict guidelines to ensure a positive user experience. Violent or gory content involving people or animals is not allowed on the platform.\nCan you get paid to type words?\nYes, there are various typing jobs available, such as transcribing audio into text, copying information from hard copies into digital format, and data entry. Legitimate companies offer paid opportunities for these tasks.\nHow much money do you make on tick?\nTikTok pays creators around $0.02 to $0.04 for every 1,000 views through its TikTok Creator Fund. However, earnings may vary, and eligibility for the fund is based on specific criteria.\nHow does what3words actually work?\nWhat3words has divided the world into 3m squares and assigned each square a unique three-word address. These words are generated using a mathematical algorithm and remain fixed, ensuring consistency and accuracy in location identification.\nWhy is what three words free?\nWhile what3words offers its app and online map for free, it is important to note that the company is a proprietary business and licenses its services to commercial entities. The app’s accessibility and ease of use contribute to its popularity and adoption.\nIs what3words profitable?\nSince its launch, what3words has been unprofitable and has experienced increasing losses year-on-year. However, the widespread adoption and integration of its addressing system could potentially contribute to future profitability.",
