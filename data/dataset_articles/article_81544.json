  "text": "Sony has just announced the release of the new “ULT POWER SOUND” audio series, focusing on delivering heavy bass sound performance. This series includes a new headset and two Bluetooth speakers, all designed to bring a powerful bass experience to users.\nThe “ULT POWER SOUND” series features a new branding strategy with the introduction of the “ULT” pronunciation, emphasizing the focus on strong bass effects. The ULT series includes the “ULT WEAR” wireless headphones and “ULT FIELD” wireless speakers, both designed to enhance bass performance for different types of music.\nThe ULT WEAR headphones are equipped with a 40mm driver unit and a built-in V1 integrated processor to deliver impactful sound effects. They also feature an “ULT” button to switch between two levels of subwoofer mode, providing deep low-frequency bass or more powerful bass, depending on the user’s preference.\nAdditionally, the ULT WEAR headphones support active noise reduction and have a wind noise reduction structure to enhance the listening experience. They also offer a long playback time of up to 50 hours (NC OFF) and support fast charging for convenience.\nThe ULT FIELD 1 and ULT FIELD 7 Bluetooth wireless speakers are designed for portable use and powerful sound performance. The ULT FIELD 1 speaker features a lanyard for easy hanging, while the ULT FIELD 7 speaker is larger in size and can provide deep bass performance.\nBoth speakers support dual-machine connection and “Party Mode” to connect multiple speakers for a stereo playback system. The ULT FIELD 1 and 7 speakers are expected to be released in July 2024, offering flexibility and versatility for users seeking a high-quality audio experience.\nWith the release of the “ULT POWER SOUND” series, Sony continues to innovate and deliver premium audio products that cater to the needs of music lovers who appreciate heavy bass effects.",
