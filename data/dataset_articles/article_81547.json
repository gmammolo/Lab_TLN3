  "text": "New 2025 Alfa Romeo Milano Debut https://youtu.be/8sOCVipdg2U Sporty at heart, compact in size and Italian style at first sight. The wait is over. Alfa Romeo presented the new MILANO to the international press right in Milan, at the historic headquarters of the Automobile Club Milano, in an unconventional way and with a dual purpose: on the one hand, to demonstrate Alfa Romeo's new language; on the other, to confirm that visceral and proud partnership with the city where Alfa Romeo was founded in 1910 as an emblem of the perfect balance between innovation and tradition, founding characteristics that bind the brand to its hometown. Orders opened for MILANO in the \"SPECIALE\" launch version, the new gateway to the Alfa Romeo world for everyone, Alfisti fans and beyond, who has been awaiting the brand's return to the segment. To play a leading role, Alfa Romeo offers the sportiest and most exciting compact car to drive in the entire class, the only one that can enter into conversation with enthusiasts for the Giulietta and Mito and attract a new generation of Alfisti fans. Alfa Romeo MILANO is inclusive and offers everyone the opportunity to access a distinctive and attractive car. Its mission is to win over a new generation, through a new design language. Remaining steadfast is its innate aptitude for sportiness, a trait that has animated Alfa Romeo since 1910, with 'sportiness' intended as an engaging driving experience in everyday life. In a segment populated by sporty versions derived from generalist models, MILANO is proposed as a cool and unique object, combining a captivating style with the most advanced technology in terms of comfort, connectivity, and driving dynamics. Uncompromising comfort, as evidenced by the largest trunk among premium competitors (400 L). MILANO is also available in hybrid and electric, without distinctions in terms of aesthetics or equipment, because the only thing that matters is the fact it is 100% Alfa Romeo.
