For the 2025 model year, Porsche is giving the all-electric Taycan a particularly extensive update. The new versions benefit from more power, greater range, quicker acceleration and possibility of even faster charging. Porsche also sharpened the design and created greater differentiation for the Turbo models. All new Taycan versions feature a more extensive list of standard equipment and come equipped with the latest generation of the Porsche Driver Experience featuring an improved display and control concept. Both body styles will offer this extensive list of enhancements – the Taycan sports sedan, and the versatile Taycan Cross Turismo, which is available with an off-road package. In each case, four powertrain options are available, with rear- and all-wheel drive variants. The upgraded sedan and Cross Turismo versions are scheduled to arrive at Porsche Centers in the U.S. from the summer. Globally, the sports car manufacturer has produced almost 150,000 examples of the Taycan. The most important individual markets for the Taycan are currently the US, the UK, Germany and China.
