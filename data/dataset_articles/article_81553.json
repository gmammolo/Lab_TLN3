  "text": "Hyundai Mobis announced its participation in the 37th World Electric Vehicle Symposium and Exhibition (EVS37), which will take place at COEX in Seoul from April 23 for four days, where it will showcase its core technologies for future mobility. EVS37 is the world’s largest electric vehicle symposium and exhibition, rotating annually across three continents (North America, Europe, and Asia). This year, it returns to Korea for the first time in nine years, drawing significant attention. The event is dubbed the “Electric Vehicle Olympics,” with global mobility industry stakeholders participating en masse. Hyundai Mobis researchers will present dozens of papers related to electric vehicles at this symposium. It is reported that Hyundai Mobis has the highest number of participants presenting papers among the companies at EVS37. In particular, the discussion-generating demonstration car \"MOBION\" will be revealed in Korea for the first time in the exhibition space. MOBION is a concept car equipped with next-generation electric vehicle propulsion technology, the e-Corner System, and communication lighting technology. Hyundai Mobis will demonstrate sideways crab-walking movement and zero-turn rotation in place to visitors at EVS37. In addition, a wide array of core electrification technologies supporting the innovation of MOBION will be displayed. These include the electric vehicle drive motor and inverter, the EDU 3-in-1 electric drive unit, in-wheel systems, and the e-Corner System, among others. The Battery System Assembly, a critical component of electrification, will also be exhibited. Hyundai Mobis possesses a diverse portfolio of BSAs for various eco-friendly vehicles, allowing for customized responses to different manufacturers.
