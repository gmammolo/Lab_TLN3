With the new safety preference sections, users can easily access features like PIN verification and ShareMyTrip and conveniently set them to activate automatically. CARDIFF, WALES - FEBRUARY 19: In this photo illustration, a close-up of an Uber app is seen on an iPhone on February 19, 2021, in Cardiff, Wales. (Photo illustration by Matthew Horwood/Getty Images) Enhanced Safety Options for Uber Users [Uber has introduced a new safety preferences section](https://www.uber.com/newsroom/set-it-and-forget-it-how-to-maximize-your-safety-features/), simplifying access to its safety tools and allowing users to schedule their activation automatically. These safety tools include options like audio recording, which securely stores trip audio for Uber's investigative use, and [PIN verification](https://www.google.com/search?q=PIN+verification+techtimes&oq=PIN+verification+techtimes&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyCQgAEEUYORigAdIBCDI4NTlqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to ensure you're entering the correct vehicle. Additionally, you can share your live location and ride details with trusted contacts using [ShareMyTrip](https://sharetrip.net/), and Uber will be notified if a ride suddenly deviates from its intended route with [RideCheck](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/245538/20191001/uber-is-testing-audio-recording-feature-for-riders-who-feel-unsafe.htm). Users can opt to activate all safety features for every ride or customize settings based on specific times and locations. For instance, you can choose to activate ShareMyTrip only on weekends or after 9 PM or enable PIN verification when you're within 50 meters of certain bars or restaurants.

Click on \"Safety checkup\" and then \"Start setup\" under \"Safety preferences\" to add your preferred safety tools. From there, you can decide whether to schedule these preferences for all, some, or no rides. Alternatively, during a ride, you can tap on the blue shield icon for the Safety Toolkit and select \"Set up safety preferences. The new safety preferences page is currently accessible in the US, Canada, and Latin America. However, Uber plans to introduce it to additional regions in the coming months. Navigating Safety Concerns in Nighttime Activities Having a good time while being out at night should come with a sense of safety. Unfortunately, a [recent study](https://news.gallup.com/poll/544415/personal-safety-fears-three-decade-high.aspx) shows that 53% of women feel unsafe walking alone within a mile of their home after dark. Whether going on a first date or returning home after a night out with friends, women often consider safety when making choices. In recent years, Uber has implemented various safety features in response to reports of sexual assault and other unsafe incidents like [accidents and robberies. ](https://www.uber.com/en-TW/blog/kaohsiung/) Data from the company's most recent [safety report](https://uber.app.box.com/s/vkx4zgwy6sxx2t2618520xt35rix022h?uclick_id=869c4521-335f-4850-b6c2-4cf0d7fbb71c) indicates that from 2017 to 2020, Uber received 9,805 reports of sexual assault during rides and 852 reports of rape. Despite these figures, Uber claims to have observed a 38 percent decrease in sexual assaults since its initial safety report in 2018. Safety concerns, particularly those related to sexual assault, impact not only passengers but also drivers. [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22878214/uber-lyft-women-drivers-sexual-assault-harassment-safety) reported that some women have taken measures into their own hands by forming buddy systems through local Facebook groups to enhance safety. According to Michelle Dottin, a driver and advocate, there are concerns about Uber's response to driver assaults. She believes that safety measures should be comprehensive, addressing the needs of both passengers and drivers.
