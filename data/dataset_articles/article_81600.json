  "text": "The latest from Google's development of the Android operating system now brings the latest, Android 15 Beta 1, for Pixel users to download and experience for the first time. Those who are part of the program and Android 14's Beta program will automatically get the next-gen version, but there are ways to join the program and install the new OS manually. Google's Android 15 Beta 1 is Now Available for Pixel The first beta of Android 15 is now here, and it brings all the latest features and technology that was released on the developer preview released over the past two months since February. It is released under the [Android Beta for Pixel](https://www.google.com/android/beta), with Google's smartphones being the first to get the new OS. Other eligible smartphone brands will be announced for their chance to experience the beta. With this update, apps are now displayed edge-to-edge by default on the new OS, and system bars become transparent or translucent, with the content appearing behind them. App archiving and unarchiving, as seen on the developer preview, also makes its way to the beta, alongside E2eeContactKeys Manager, TalkBack Braille support, polling loop activity notifications, and enhanced app security.

Only those powered by the Google Tensor chip are eligible to join. Users only have to head to the Android Beta [website](https://www.google.com/android/beta), sign in to their Google account, and select the eligible device to run the beta. However, Google also offers a way to sideload the Android 15 by downloading [the files](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/download-ota), booting to recovery mode, using ADB sideload, connecting to a computer with the ADB tools, and rebooting the device. Other requirements include joining the Android Developer Preview 2 or Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2 before this sideload to successfully run Android 15 Beta 1. Android 15's Rumored OS Features The latest of what Google offers for smartphones is finally here, with Android 15 now available on the beta program for people to test, try, and experience what it offers. Earlier this year, there were a lot of rumors and leaks about what Android 15 will bring, and one of the top recurring information was about [ Battery Health improvements](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/300061/20231226/android-15-users-receive-updates-battery-health-3-major-points.htm) for the devices. Another rumor about Android 15 is its capability to bring satellite messaging to Android smartphones. There were massive reports that this feature would deliver a new kind of connection for users. The report claimed that these were found on the developer preview of Android 15. It said that this would be a widely usable feature and not only for emergencies. For now, Pixel users may be able to join the beta program to test out Android 15, and those who are not automatically joined may download and sideload it to their eligible Pixel device.
