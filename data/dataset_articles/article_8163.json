  "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — I-465 southbound on the city's southeast side will soon reopen. On Friday, INDOT announced their plans to roll out the reopening of the interstate after a three week closure. The closure of I-465 southbound between I-70 and I-65 on the southeast side started on May 31 as crews worked on pavement restoration and bridge work. Now, three weeks later, the road is ready for traffic again. 📍 Marion County— INDOT East Central (@INDOTEast) Here's what to expect for the reopening of the I-465 southbound lanes and ramps. 👇 We start with restriping all of the lanes to get them back to their original configuration. This is a long process - expect the lanes to steadily reopen. [pic.twitter.com/7cdXGy7Lnf] [June 21, 2024] Lanes and ramps will open between late Friday and Saturday morning. Meanwhile, lane restriping will be done slightly north of the reopening — between 46th Street and I-70. Don't breathe too easy though Hoosiers. WATCH | Indiana's Latest Headlines After a three week break, INDOT will close I-465 northbound through the same stretch. That closure is expected to start on July 12.",
