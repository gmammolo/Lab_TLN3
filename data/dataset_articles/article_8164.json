  "text": "Published 43 minutes ago\nSubmitted by Sysco\nOriginally published on June 5th on LinkedIn\nAt Sysco, our purpose is connecting the world to share food and care for one another. That’s why we’re honored to give $10,000 to the\nAmerican Red Cross during their telethon and $10,000 to the Houston Food Bank to help aid their community efforts following the recent storms in Texas. Sysco colleagues at our Global Support Center also came together to donate shelf-stable, healthy food items and decorate lunch bags for a local non-profit, Kids' Meals, Inc. which was impacted by the power outages in Houston.\nAbout Sysco\nSysco is the global leader in selling, marketing and distributing food products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other customers who prepare meals away from home. Its family of products also includes equipment and supplies for the foodservice and hospitality industries. With more than 74,000 colleagues, the company operates 334 distribution facilities worldwide and serves approximately 725,000 customer locations. For fiscal year 2023 that ended July 1, 2023, the company generated sales of more than $76 billion.
