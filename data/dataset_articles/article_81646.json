  "text": "It’s been\na long time coming, but with Fallout fever at a high right now thanks to the Prime Video series that debuted yesterday, Bethesda has finally announced plans to drop its much-anticipated current-gen update for 2015’s Fallout 4.\nThe free update update is coming on April 25th and will bring native versions of the game to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and will also offer a number of improvements including Performance and Quality modes that target 60FPS and increased resolutions, as well as improvements to stability and gameplay fixes.\nFallout 4 for PS4 and Xbox One will also be getting an update that includes stability improvements and fixes, and on PC players will be getting widescreen and ultra-widescreen support along with a number of other fixes. The game will also be coming to the Epic Games Store for the first time, and will become Steam Deck Verified.\nThe announcement is light on any other details, but there will be new Creation Club content available for free alongside this update as well, which includes some Enclave-related gear, a goofy makeshift weapon pack and some Halloween decorations.\nReturn to the Commonwealth April 25th! Learn more about the\n[#Fallout]4 next-gen update coming to console and PC, and additional free content for players in the Wasteland: [pic.twitter.com/xJ4FSbRUd6]\n— Bethesda Game Studios (@BethesdaStudios)\n[April 11, 2024]\nThe full series of Fallout is\nout now on Prime Video. RELATED: The PlayStation Store's Massive Easter Sale Has Kicked Off And Here Are The Best Deals And Games\nSet in Los Angeles a whole 200 years after a nuclear apocalypse, Fallout follows Lucy (played by Ella Purnell) as she steps out of Vault 33 into the unknown and unhinged world above.\n“Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there’s almost nothing left to have,” the show’s description reads.\n“200 years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind — and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird and highly violent universe waiting for them.”\nYou can find out more about the show and how to watch it in our full guide\nhere, and read our review of the series here.",
