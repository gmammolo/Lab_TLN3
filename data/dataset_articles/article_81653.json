  "text": "Stony Brook University Named an ASM “Milestones in Microbiology” Site\nStony Brook, N.Y. — The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) is honored to designate the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University as a “Milestones in Microbiology” site for its advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases globally. The department will be designated as a milestones site during an Oct.17, 2024, celebration and ceremony honoring noted scientists and historic first achievements.\nThe “Milestones in Microbiology” program was established by ASM to promote greater awareness and appreciation for the microbial sciences and to stimulate interest in our microbiological heritage. The award recognizes sites where major developments and pivotal discoveries occurred.\n“ASM is delighted to recognize Stony Brook University's Department of Microbiology and Immunology as a 'Milestones in Microbiology' site for its significant contributions to the microbial sciences,” said Theresa Koehler, Ph. D., ASM President. “The university’s pioneering work investigating causative agents of human diseases have had far-reaching impacts in the sciences and society at large.”\nStony Brook University is a flagship research institution of the State University of New York. Since its inception, the university’s department of microbiology and immunology has been at the forefront of microbial science research, collaborating with pharmaceutical companies, government agencies and community physicians to improve the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases around the world. Notable accomplishments include:\n- The establishment of the department of microbiology, now designated as the department of microbiology and immunology, under the leadership of Joseph Kates, Ph.D., in 1972.\n- The landmark discovery by Founding Chair Kates that viruses could package enzymes required for their replication, with the first demonstration of the vaccinia virus encapsulating the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme. This laid the groundwork for targeting viral polymerases as a widespread therapeutic strategy.\n- The first identification of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, by Jorge Benach, Ph.D., Willy Burgdorfer, Ph.D., and scientists from the Rocky Mountain Laboratory, paved the way for successful antibiotic therapies.\n- The first description of the de-novo chemical-biochemical synthesis of a virus (poliovirus) in the absence of a natural template by Eckard Wimmer, Dr. rer. nat., and the co-discovery of the human receptor for poliovirus with Vincent Racaniello, Ph.D. This marked the beginning of the total synthesis of organisms in the absence of natural templates, enabling new strategies in virus vaccine development.\nLearn more about ASM’s \"Milestones in Microbiology\" program and how to apply for \"Milestones in Microbiology\" recognition.\n###\nThe American Society for Microbiology is one of the largest professional societies dedicated to the life sciences and is composed of over 32,000 scientists and health practitioners. ASM's mission is to promote and advance the microbial sciences.\nASM advances the microbial sciences through conferences, publications, certifications, educational opportunities and advocacy efforts. It enhances laboratory capacity around the globe through training and resources. It provides a network for scientists in academia, industry and clinical settings. Additionally, ASM promotes a deeper understanding of the microbial sciences to diverse audiences.",
