  "text": "John Deere Adds SmartDetect to Select Loaders [John Deere Construction](/10712446) Editors note: This article has been updated. [John Deere](https://www.constructionequipment.com/earthmoving/company/10712446/john-deere-construction) has added its [SmartDetect](https://www.constructionequipment.com/home/news/10758398/john-deere-precision-construction-expands-tech-offering), an object detection system that enhances overall situational awareness for operators, to select [utility-class and production-class wheel loaders](https://www.constructionequipment.com/earthmoving/wheel-loaders). This summer, John Deere introduced the SmartDetect Field Kits for 444-904[ P-Tier](https://www.constructionequipment.com/earthmoving/news/10758116/deere-launches-performance-tiering-strategy) and[ X-Tier ](https://www.constructionequipment.com/earthmoving/news/21438651/how-deere-performance-tiering-strategy-is-lining-up)models. With [safety ](https://www.constructionequipment.com/topical/safety-security)being a constant concern in the construction industry, the technology aims to provide operators with greater visibility. SmartDetect achieves this awareness through strategically positioned cameras. The system includes stereo cameras that work in pairs, delivering a 3D perception view that can identify bystanders and obstacles behind the loader. The technology is complemented by a secondary [G5 display](https://www.constructionequipment.com/technology/construction-technology-software), which provides operators with a live digital feed, along with visual and audible alerts. “The camera positioning is tailored to increase and enhance a wider field of view,” Voelliger says. “In addition, automotive-style dynamic travel path lines during reverse operations and object classification notifications help keep the operator alert and informed.” SmartDetect also incorporates machine learning for increased visbility. “We had to develop an AI/CVML (computer vision machine learning) model specifically for the construction environment,” Voelliger says. “This solution relies on images taken from job sites to create real-life learnings. No two job sites are the same, and developing a dataset that performs to our customers’ expectations in various conditions was a significant challenge.” Another component of SmartDetect is its bystander alarm, designed to grab attention quickly, even in the noisy environment of a job site. “The alarm is unique and distinct, allowing it to cut through the common sounds of construction and alert crew members in real time,” says Voelliger.",
