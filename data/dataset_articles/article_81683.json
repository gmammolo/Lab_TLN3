  "text": "Amazon has revised its e-book readers. New is a Kindle with a color screen. However, it has its price. A device is set.\nThe US company Amazon has redesigned the Kindle series and now also offers an e-book reader with a color display. The company announced this. According to media reports, the company is said to have separated from a Kindle model.\nAmazon calls its color Kindle Kindle Colorsoft . According to the manufacturer, the display features “a new light guide with nitride LEDs, which, in combination with Amazon’s algorithms, improves color and increases brightness without blurring details.” Images and texts should be able to be enlarged without becoming pixelated.\nThe Kindle Colorsoft can be charged wirelessly and, according to Amazon, offers a battery life of up to 8 weeks. The price: 289.99 euros. The device will be available from October 30th.\nAmazon has also improved the Kindle Scribe . The display of the digital notebook is surrounded by a new white frame and should have a pleasant, paper-like texture.\nThis should make writing on the display feel like the user is writing something down on a piece of paper. The included stylus should also feel like a real pencil, as does the new eraser.\nAmazon wants 419.99 euros for the new Kindle Scribe. Sales start on December 4th.\nThe Kindle Paperwhite has also been improved, and is now said to be faster than previous models. Amazon writes that book pages can be changed 25 percent faster on the device.\n“The display has the highest contrast ratio of any Kindle device,” says Amazon. And although the device is thinner than previous versions, the battery life is said to be up to three months.\nThe Kindle Paperwhite is now available with 16 GB of storage space in black, jade green and pink for 179.99 euros.\nAmazon is now also offering the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition with 32 GB of storage space, optional wireless charging and a front light with automatic adjustment in the colors black metallic, jade green metallic and pink metallic for 199.99 euros.\nAmazon has also renewed the smallest e-book reader. At maximum setting, the Kindle’s display should shine 25 percent brighter than the previous model. Turning pages should be faster than before.\nThe new Kindle is available in black and matcha green. The price: 109.99 euros. The device is available now.\nAmazon has discontinued the Kindle Oasis, which is the only e-book reader from the manufacturer that still has physical buttons for turning pages. Amazon confirmed to the US magazine “The Verge” that it had said goodbye to the device.",
