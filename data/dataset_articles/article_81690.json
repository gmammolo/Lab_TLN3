  "text": "Independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board Endorsed Dose Escalation and Broadening of Eligibility Criteria; Cohort 2 Now Enrolling\nInitial Data from Cohort 1 to be Reported in December 2024\nHighlights Recently Presented Insights on Pediatric MYBPC3-associated HCM Disease Burden\nSOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Oct. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tenaya Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: TNYA), a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a mission to discover, develop and deliver potentially curative therapies that address the underlying causes of heart disease, today shared updates related to its ongoing Phase 1b/2 MyPEAK-1 clinical trial of TN-201. TN-201 is being developed for the potential treatment of MYBPC3 -associated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition caused by insufficient levels of myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C). TN-201 gene replacement therapy is designed to increase protein levels of MyBP-C to slow or even reverse the course of disease by delivering a functional copy of the MYBPC3 gene to heart muscle cells.\n\"The MyPEAK-1 study of TN-201 is primarily intended to establish the safety profile of TN-201 gene therapy, and we are pleased to report that TN-201 has an appropriate tolerability profile at the 3E13 vg/kg dose without unexpected adverse reactions,” said Whit Tingley, M.D., Ph.D., Tenaya's Chief Medical Officer. \"The DSMB's recommendation to proceed with dose escalation and endorsement to expand eligibility criteria are further positive early indicators for TN-201's safety profile and enable Tenaya to explore the utility of TN-201 in different populations. We've implemented adjustments to the protocol, including the addition of a biopsy at baseline, broadening eligibility to include obstructive HCM patients and increasing the size of the overall MyPEAK-1 study.”",
