  "text": "Remedy Games Announces FBC: Firebreak, a Multiplayer Spin-off Set in the Control Universe Alan Wake and Control developer Remedy has unveiled FBC: Firebreak, a three-player co-op multiplayer spin-off set in the same universe.\nA trailer showcased during the Xbox Partner Preview revealed an exciting first look at the gameplay. Players will take on the role of first responders within the familiar Federal Bureau of Control, revisiting iconic areas within The Oldest House , as seen in Control.\nFBC: Firebreak marks Remedy’s inaugural foray into multiplayer gaming and will receive regular updates post-launch. However, according to Remedy’s communication director Thomas Puha, it is not intended to follow a ‘game as a service’ model.\nFBC: Firebreak. Watch on YouTube “We have always focused on single-player experiences at Remedy,” Puha stated. “Rest assured, we have more single-player games in development, and they will be awesome. However, for quite some time, we’ve been eager to create a PvE multiplayer experience. Many of us here appreciate multiplayer experiences in addition to single-player. We want to explore new challenges rather than sticking to our usual formula.”\nSet after the events of Control, FBC: Firebreak will delve deeper into the Federal Bureau of Control and its various agents, showcasing more of its bizarre elements — such as lethal sticky notes and ‘objects of power’ that can be wielded as weapons, including a garden gnome.\nFBC: Firebreak is set to launch for PC and consoles in 2025, and it will be available on Xbox Game Pass on day one.\nExpert Discussion Today’s Guests: Dr. Lisa Hartman, Game Design Expert Mark Yates, Gaming Industry Analyst Sarah Kim, Technology Reviewer Discussion Highlights: Moderator: What are your thoughts on Remedy’s shift towards multiplayer with FBC: Firebreak?\nDr. Hartman: It’s an exciting evolution for Remedy. Their focus on single-player narratives has been their strength, but exploring multiplayer can offer a fresh perspective on their storytelling.\nMark Yates: I agree! While I value single-player experiences, multiplayer collaborations can foster community engagement, especially within such a mysterious universe.\nSarah Kim: The creative potential with multiplayer mechanics, especially in a universe as rich as Control, is vast. I am particularly interested in how they will balance the bizarre elements with cooperative gameplay.\nModerator: How do you see the integration of ‘objects of power’ impacting gameplay?\nDr. Hartman: It adds layers of strategy and fun! Utilizing unique weapons like a garden gnome creatively aligns with the quirky aesthetic of the Control universe.\nWe invite our readers to share their opinions on FBC: Firebreak.
