  "text": "Amazon announced three agreements on Wednesday for the development of small nuclear reactors, joining other technology giants seeking to respond to high energy demand from artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud services.\nThe online commerce giant will invest in small modular reactors (SMR), which are more compact and potentially easier to install than traditional reactors.\n“One of the easiest ways to respond to climate change is to transition our society to carbon-free sources, and nuclear energy is both carbon-free and capable of growth, making it an important area for Amazon investments,” said Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman\nAlthough a total value of investments was not detailed, Amazon reported an agreement with Energy Northwest to develop SMRs in the state of Washington, with the potential to generate 960 megawatts (MW) of energy by the beginning of 2030.\nAnother agreement for 500 million dollars was signed with X-energy, a leader in the development of SMR, for new nuclear energy projects that generate more than five gigawatts.\nAnd finally, Amazon partnered with Dominion Energy to explore an SMR project near the North Anna nuclear station in Northern Virginia, to generate at least 300 MW to meet projected increased demand.\nThis region, which is home to the largest data center in the world, has increased its energy demand to an unprecedented level due to the expansion of the sector.\nJust like Amazon, companies like Google and Microsoft have rapidly expanded the capacity of their data centers and are looking for new sources of electricity.\nBut SMR technology is still in development and for now there is no regulation for its use, so there are doubts about the deadlines for its implementation.\nNuclear energy, however, has strong detractors due to concerns about the disposal of radioactive waste, the possibility of catastrophic accidents and the high costs associated with the construction and decommissioning of plants.\nAccording to Goldman Sachs, data center energy demand is estimated to grow 160% by 2030 and AI will account for about 19% of demand by 2028.\n© Agence France-Presse",
