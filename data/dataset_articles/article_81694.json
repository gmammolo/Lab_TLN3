A limited-time community playtest is available now for PC.\nGet the first details below.\nWhat is Project ETHOS ?\nA Roguelike Hero Shooter – Shape your playstyle every match through Evolutions, powerful, semi-randomized, upgrades unique to each hero. Evolve a sniper into a close-range skirmisher, or a support role into a powerful lone wolf. Build your hero in real-time to suit your personal playstyle. Signature Extraction Mode – Drop into Trials, an ongoing, persistent fight to collect cores, extract, and unlock powerful Augments which fuel your future Trials runs. Build Your Perfect Run, or Die Trying – Discover new levels of mastery across every run as you take on the competition with new abilities, stakes, and challenges that change every match. With the clock ticking, do you safely extract with your hard-earned cores, or go big, risk it all, and see if you and your team can earn top ranking. The choice is yours. How to Access the Community Playtest?\nThe best way to learn about Project ETHOS is to play it.\n2K and 31st Union are bringing players in from the start so they can play the game themselves and be a part of the development process.\nIn the current community playtest, players will be able to play two modes:\nTrials – Our signature mode, Trials, is an ongoing, persistent fight to collect cores, extract, and unlock powerful Augments which fuel your future Trials runs.
