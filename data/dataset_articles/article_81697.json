  "text": "Eternal Strands will be available for Xbox Series via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC via PC Game Pass on day one when it launches in early 2025, developer Yellow Brick Games announced. The PC version will also be available via Epic Games Store .\n“We’re very happy to share the news with Game Pass subscribers today, and we’re convinced they will enjoy the ‘Cast and Combine’ freedom and the epic battles our game has to offer,” said Yellow Brick Games CEO Thomas Giroux in a press release. “The team is very excited for this partnership with Xbox and the opportunity this will bring to allow more players to experience Eternal Strands when it releases early next year. We can’t wait to see the players’ reactions.”\nGet the latest details below.\n“Cast and Combine” Trailer\nThe “Cast and Combine” gameplay trailer unveiled today reveals the Highland Iceclaw—a formidable, flying Epic that will challenge players to rethink their approach in combat as they dodge its chilling ice attacks or climb onto its back mid-flight with a kinetic launch.\nThe trailer also showcases how gameplay mechanics are meant to synergize, encouraging players to cast magic powers and combine them strategically for maximum effect. With this versatile magic system, players can shape their own combat style in countless ways combining frost, flame, and kinetic force to overcome the formidable Arks and Epic creatures within the Enclave. Once defeated, these enemies will respawn, providing an opportunity to challenge them in different areas with new strategies to harvest their threads or collect rare resources using new elemental combinations.\nAn Epic Arrival: Eternal Strands Heads to the Epic Games Store\nThe studio recently revealed that the game will also be available on the Epic Games Store at launch. This announcement was made during Unreal Fest in Seattle in early October, where the studio’s CTO, Louis Tremblay, delivered a talk on the complex physics systems the programming team developed on Unreal Engine 5 to achieve a high level of interactivity between the world, the Epics, and the main character, Brynn.\nWhat to Expect in Eternal Strands\nChallenge Your Creativity – Combine your growing array of magical powers and enchanted weapons on the battlefield. Highly Interactive and Breakable Environments – The world is your weapon. Burn, freeze, throw everything. Climb Every Surface – Even colossal enemies! A Beautiful World to Explore – Rich with secrets to uncover, with a warm supporting cast. Eternal Strands is due out for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store in early 2025.\nWatch the new trailer below.\nCast and Combine Trailer",
