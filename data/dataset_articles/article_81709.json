  "text": "From runway chic to the future of space mechanical engineering, Italian fashion house Prada has unveiled new designs for the next generation of spacesuits. In partnership with space industry leaders Axiom Space, the atypical collaboration is now helping NASA bridge the gap between high fashion and space exploration by creating new spacesuits for the forthcoming Artemis III lunar mission. Scheduled for a targeted launch in September of 2026, the Artemis III lunar mission will mark the first time a woman and a person of color will set foot on the Moon in the first crewed lunar exploration since December 1972. Outside of fashion, diversity, and culture, the NASA mission aims to land astronauts near the lunar South Pole , helping to push the goal forward of creating a long-term human presence on the moon and helping to prepare for similar explorations of Mars in the years ahead. NASA is no stranger to working with patterns designed with women in mind. The first modern spacesuit was crafted by a group of designers at the International Latex Corporation (ILC), best known for fabricating and constructing bras and girdles in the 1960s. First worn by Neil Armstrong during the Apollo 11 mission, designers created the A7L to protect astronauts from the harsh conditions of space and the lunar surface. The A7L spacesuit used materials such as neoprene, Beta cloth (designed to protect astronauts from high temperatures), and aluminized mylar. It was a complicated spacesuit design with several layers to ensure protection, motility, and pressure. Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada Group Chief Marketing Officer and Head of Corporate Social Responsibility, said in a statement that “Going beyond our limits is one of the company’s values that perfectly reflects the spirit of the Prada brand and my parents’ vision.” “I’m very proud of the result we’re showing today, which is just the first step in a long-term collaboration with Axiom Space,” Beretlli added. “We’ve shared our expertise on high-performance materials, features, and sewing techniques, and we learned a lot.” “I’m sure we’ll continue to explore new challenges, broaden our horizons, and build new scenarios together,” Bertelli said. The first look at the new spacesuit designs was revealed at the International Astronautical Congress in Milan and presented to the public on October 18, with a fashion installation at the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II as an extension of the IAC event. “Our elite teams have redefined spacesuit development, establishing new pathways to innovative solutions and applying a state-of-the-art design approach for the AxEMU,” said Matt Ondler, Axiom Space President, in a press release. “We have broken the mold. The Axiom Space-Prada partnership has set a new foundational model for cross-industry collaboration, further expanding what’s possible in commercial space.” With the help of Prada’s knowledge and innovation in raw materials and designs alongside the experience of the Axiom Space team, the first human exploration of the lunar south pole will bring NASA and space tourism enthusiasts around the globe closer to traveling the cosmos in style. “We are pioneering a new era in space exploration where partnerships are imperative to the commercialization of space,” said Russell Ralston, Executive Vice President of Extravehicular Activity, Axiom Space. “Partnerships build a strong, cohesive team, enabling industry experts to provide cutting-edge technology, specialized products, and services to drive innovation.” “For the first time, we are leveraging expertise in other industries to craft a better solution for space.” Chrissy Newton is a PR professional and founder of VOCAB Communications.
