  "text": "Sker Ritual: Tides of Terror DLC Now Available on Xbox Series X|S\nSummary\n- Explore the haunted shores of Sker Beach.\n- Battle terrifying new sea-spawned enemies and unlock hidden easter egg missions.\n- Play the free demo on Series X|S, with an Xbox One port coming soon.\nExplore the New Map: Tides of Terror\nThe Tides of Terror takes players to the cursed shores of Sker Beach, where shipwrecks from centuries past litter the landscape. Long-rumoured to be haunted, the island is now overrun by the vengeful forces of the sea. Once a site of gruesome experiments led by Elisabeth Williams, its infected ruins and hostile waters conceal dark secrets and mutated creatures waiting to strike.\nYou must navigate this treacherous terrain, battling sea-born monstrosities and uncovering the wreckage of failed experiments. As you fight through the sands, the caves, and the shipwrecks, each encounter reveals another piece of Sker Beach’s chilling history.\nNew Missions and Hidden Secrets Await\nTides of Terror offers a full, guided story mission that takes you through the most haunted corners of Sker Beach. For the more daring players, hidden unguided missions await. One secret mission leads to a boss fight, while another uncovers an exclusive EE music track by brothers, Joe and Gareth Lumb. These missions are designed to test your knowledge of the game and your willingness to explore every dark corner of Sker Beach.\nMeet the New Enemies of the Deep\n- Y Cracen: The colossal main boss, a sea creature with immense power, rises from the depths to end your round-based survival.\n- Lord of the Squids: This mini-boss commands the forces of the ocean, pulling the tides to his advantage with unique powers that drown anyone who stands in the way.\n- Crabs: Mutated by the island’s curse, these standard enemies are relentless in their pursuit.\nEquip Yourself with New Weapons and Perks\nNo one survives Sker Beach unarmed. The Tides of Terror DLC introduces powerful new weapons and perks to turn the tide in your favour:\n- Maelstrom: A fisherman’s Minigun that delivers devastating firepower in close-medium combat, perfect for mowing down waves of pesky crabs.\n- Auto Blunder: This automatic shotgun, inspired by the classic blunderbuss, becomes the Tidebreaker at Tier 3, unleashing massive damage on your foes.\n- More Gun: This perk adds an additional weapon slot, giving players the ability to carry three weapons into battle. It also boosts ammo capacity by 5%, with further increases for each Perk Level.\nCosmetic Masks, Weapon Skins and Battle Pass\nShow off your accomplishments with the new Pirate Crown mask, available to players who complete the main quest, the music EE, and the Hidden EE on Nightmare difficulty. Additionally, a new Battle Pass will soon introduce free cosmetics for players to grind.\nPrior to this DLC update, we added weapon skins that include a weapon XP grind for every weapon in Sker Ritual, even the special weapons! Once you’ve collected all the weapon skins you can unlock an ultimate mastery skin.\nDon’t Miss Out: Free Demo and Upcoming Xbox One Port\nIf you’re new to Sker Ritual, now is the perfect time to jump in with the free demo available on Xbox Series X|S. And for players eager to experience the game on Xbox One, stay tuned—an Xbox One port is in development and coming soon.
