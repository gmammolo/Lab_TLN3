(Nasdaq: SUPN), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases, today announced data from its exploratory open-label Phase 2a clinical study of SPN-820 in adults with major depressive disorder.

About SPN-820 SPN-820 is a first-in-class, orally active small molecule that increases the brain mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) mediated synaptic function intracellularly. SPN-820 is being developed to provide a rapid-onset antidepressant response via oral administration for adult patients with depression. The compound has a novel mechanism of action that enhances synaptic activity and cellular metabolism in the brain and has demonstrated a rapid onset of action (signal at two hours) in early clinical studies. SPN-820 is expected to provide rapid antidepressant efficacy without potential dissociative side effects. A Phase 2b clinical study of SPN-820 in approximately 227 adult patients with treatment-resistant depression is ongoing. About the SPN-820 Phase 2a Clinical Study The study is a Phase 2a open-label study in 40 subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). The primary objective of the study is to assess efficacy in MDD, as well as onset of efficacy and safety. About Supernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
