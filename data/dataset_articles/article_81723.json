  "text": "True Anomaly on Thursday said it has selected Firefly Aerospace\nto launch its Jackal spacecraft for the U.S. Space Force’s VICTUS HAZE Tactically Responsive Space (TacRS) mission expected to occur no later than fall 2025.\nFirefly will also launch two additional missions for True Anomaly between 2025 and 2027.\nThe Space Force in April awarded separate contracts to Rocket Lab [RKLB] and True Anomaly for VICTUS HAZE to demonstrate rendezvous and proximity operations with commercially-built assets to counter irresponsible behavior on orbit ( Defense Daily , April 11). True Anomaly will use an upgraded version of its Jackal autonomous orbital vehicle that can perform multi-orbit missions with a high acceleration and high delta-V propulsion system that is being developed with its propulsion supplier, Agile Space Industries.\nRocket Lab said previously it will launch its spacecraft aboard its own Electron rocket.\nThe VICTUS HAZE mission follows the VICTUS NOX TacRS mission, which involved the rapid launch of a satellite provided by a Boeing [BA] business unit aboard Firefly’s Alpha launch vehicle on Sept. 15, 2023 for a space domain awareness mission. The VICTUS NOX mission showcased launch-ready status within 24 hours of launch notice, liftoff within several hours of the launch window opening, and satellite checkout 11 hours ahead of the two-day goal ( Defense Daily , Sept. 15 and 26, 2023).\nTrue Anomaly described four phases it is executing for VICTUS HAZE: build, hot standby, launch, and on-orbit operations. The Colorado-based satellite manufacturer and software developer will complete development and testing of Jackal at its GravityWorks facility in Denver, transport it to Firefly’s SLC-2 payload processing facility at Vandenberg Space Force Base, Calif., for fueling, integration, and encapsulation in Alpha’s fairing, and then both companies will enter the hot-standby phase.\nOnce the Space Force provides the launch notice, Firefly has 24 hours to bring the payload fairing to the launch pad, mate it to Alpha, fuel the rocket, and launch within the first window. Once deployed, True Anomaly will begin on-orbit operations with Jackal that will include operating near Rocket Lab’s spacecraft.\nJason Kim, Firefly’s CEO, posted on LinkedIn that, because the company conducted the first TacRS launch for the Space Force under VICTUS NOX, “we know how to do it even better on VICTUS HAZE!”\nTrue Anomaly said the two additional launches with Firefly gives it access to responsive capacity.\n“The procurement of additional rapid, responsive launch capacity from Firefly beyond VICTUS HAZE, paired with True Anomaly’s rapid manufacturing capability, will enable standing capacity for the U.S. National Security Space enterprise to rapidly respond to mission requirements in low Earth orbit and medium Earth orbit.\nBeyond VICTUS HAZE, Space Force’s Space Systems Command has two more TacRS efforts planned, VICTUS SURGO and VICTUS SALO, which are planned for launch in late summer of early fall 2006 for the former and late 2026 for the latter. These missions, which include Impulse Space spacecraft, will leverage commercial solutions to demonstrate how pre-positioning highly maneuverable on-orbit space domain awareness assets can complement responsive launch approaches.",
