  "text": "[Instagram](http://whatstrending.com/tag/instagram) has announced a new education campaign aimed at protecting teenagers from sextortion scams, a growing threat that preys on young adults. This initiative, informed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and Thorn, seeks to help both teens and parents recognize the signs of sextortion and understand how to respond effectively if targeted. The campaign is designed to empower young people with the knowledge necessary to identify potential sextortion scams. Instagram has collaborated with leading child safety experts to create an educational video that highlights red flags, such as individuals who come on too strong, request photo exchanges, or suggest moving conversations to different apps. John Shehan, a Senior Vice President at NCMEC, remarked on the urgency of this campaign: “The dramatic rise in sextortion scams is taking a heavy toll on children and teens, with reports of online enticement increasing by over 300% from 2021 to 2023. Campaigns like this bring much-needed education to help families recognize these threats early.” The video, which reassures teens that sextortion is never their fault, provides information on taking back control from scammers. It directs viewers to a dedicated resource page, instagram.com/preventsextortion, featuring tips co-developed by Meta and Thorn, access to NCMEC’s [Take It Down tool](https://takeitdown.ncmec.org/), and live chat support from the Crisis Text Line in the U.S. To amplify the message, Instagram has enlisted popular creators that resonate with teens. These creators will share educational content, emphasizing that sextortion is never the victim’s fault and that help is available. Additionally, the campaign includes a collaboration with parent creators to educate adults about sextortion, how to recognize its signs, and the steps to take if their child falls victim to this crime. Kelbi Schnabel, Senior Manager at Thorn, noted, “Our research has shown that sextortion is on the rise and poses an increasing risk to youth. Joint initiatives like this are crucial for informing kids about the risks and empowering them to take action.” In conjunction with the education campaign, Instagram is implementing a suite of new safety features designed to further protect users from sextortion. These updates complement recent changes to [Teen Accounts](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/instagram-teen-accounts/), which provide built-in protections for younger users, limiting who can contact them and what content they see. ADVERTISEMENT Under the new measures, Instagram will enhance privacy for users identified as potentially vulnerable to sextortion. Accounts displaying suspicious behavior will be restricted from accessing followers and following lists, reducing the potential for exploitation. Additionally, new safety notices will be introduced in Instagram DMs and Messenger, alerting teens when they are interacting with someone who may be in a different country—an often-used tactic by sextortion scammers. Instagram is also introducing features to prevent the misuse of private images. Soon, users will be unable to take screenshots or record ephemeral images sent through direct messages. This update aims to give users more confidence when sharing sensitive content. Moreover, the platform will roll out a nudity protection feature globally, which will automatically blur images detected as containing nudity in DMs. This feature will be enabled by default for users under 18, providing an additional layer of security. To further support users facing issues related to sextortion, Instagram is partnering with Crisis Text Line to offer 24/7 confidential mental health support. When users report sextortion-related concerns, they will have the option to chat live with a crisis counselor. In a recent crackdown, Meta removed over 1,600 assets linked to the so-called “Yahoo Boys,” a group notorious for organizing sextortion scams. This action follows previous efforts to eliminate thousands of accounts engaging in similar activities. Meta continues to enhance its ability to identify and eliminate these harmful accounts quickly, adapting its technology to recognize patterns that indicate potential sextortion attempts. Instagram’s campaign and new safety measures signify a robust effort to combat the rising threat of sextortion. By focusing on education and prevention, the platform aims to create a safer online environment for its younger users. ADVERTISEMENT As the campaign rolls out, Instagram is committed to evolving its strategies to protect its community. This multifaceted approach not only seeks to inform and empower teens but also provides essential resources for parents, ensuring that both generations are equipped to tackle the challenges posed by sextortion scams.
