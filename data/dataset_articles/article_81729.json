  "text": "Classified in: Health , Science and technology\nSubject: PDT ALICORN Expands Virtual Primary Care for the Employer Market Through Partnership with Curai Health\nALICORN members will have access to text-based care 24/7 in all 50 states\nWASHINGTON , Oct. 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ALICORN Inc ., a leading provider of health and productivity solutions to employers and businesses, announced a partnership with Curai Health to provide chat-first virtual care. Through the partnership, Curai will empanel physicians to deliver longitudinal primary care to ALICORN members.\nCurai will provide ALICORN members with a dedicated primary care provider who will offer high-quality primary care and manage chronic conditions through asynchronous or live messaging, including refilling prescriptions, ordering labs, and making referrals. Chronic condition management programs include diabetes, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, depression, and anxiety. Curai clinicians will also support members with low-acuity mental health concerns. Members in need of urgent medical consultation can connect with a clinician at any time of day, even when the dedicated primary care provider is unavailable.\n\"It's tragic that 67 percent of bankruptcies in the US are caused by medical debt. A significant number of working people can't afford medical care resulting in complications and costs later. I understand their pain and suffering as I lost my dad prematurely due to diabetes complications. Our goal is to help employees and their families get easy access to medical care. Our program is specifically designed to offer longitudinal primary care and physician-initiated chronic condition management ? enabling employees to access the service from anywhere without any out-of-pocket costs,\" said Praveen Mooganur, CEO of ALICORN. \"Our partnership with Curai is a major step forward for how we manage our members' care and contain costs for both employees and their employers.\"\nThe partnership is expected to significantly shorten wait times to see a provider, improve referral quality, and expedite prescriptions and lab orders. The partnership's focus on connecting members with a dedicated primary care provider will also enrich the quality of care over time.\n\"Many digital health solutions are great for episodic urgent care, but few excel at providing long-term primary care,\" said Neal Khosla , CEO and Cofounder of Curai Health. \"Curai is a different kind of care provider ? we accompany patients across every leg of their healthcare journey. We're excited to partner with ALICORN because they recognize the value of longitudinal primary care.\"\nAs the pioneer in deploying machine learning into clinical workflows, Curai keeps patients engaged in their care over time, improving health outcomes and reducing costs.
