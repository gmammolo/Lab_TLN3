  "text": "You've probably heard of Oura's smart rings before, one of the best sleep and recovery trackers, but a new player entered the ring this July: Samsung. It's the first time a big tech company has produced a smart ring, the Samsung Galaxy Ring. As the name implies, it's mostly geared to Samsung users, although any Android user can use it with some limitations. Right now, the Samsung Galaxy Ring is $327.99 (originally $399.99), the lowest price it has reached since its recent release, according to price-checking tools. Samsung Galaxy Ring AI Smart Ring, Size First w\\/Sizing Kit, No App Subscription, Fitness Monitor, Sleep Tracker... $327.99 at Amazon $399.99 Save $72.00 Get Deal Get Deal $327.99 at Amazon $399.99 Save $72.00 Samsung's Galaxy Ring isn't a one-time gadget it threw at the wall to see if it would stick: it's a well-made health-monitoring product that is likely to have improved generations in the future. But as a first-generation smart ring, it's solid, according to PCMag's review, as long as you have a Samsung phone to get the most out of it. It is a solid health and sleep tracker, but the activity tracking is better left to smartwatches. The Galaxy Ring has a titanium finish with color options including gold, silver, and black. Like Oura rings, it’s a bit bulky compared to regular rings at 7 mm wide and 2.6 mm thick. Anyone wearing it can see their sleep, heart rate, and skin temperature, but Samsung users can control their phone’s camera or dismiss alarms by tapping their ring finger to their thumb twice in a row. The best part of the ring compared to the main competition, Oura rings, is that it's subscription-free. It also has a wireless charging case included and is IP68 water resistant so you can wash your hands or shower with it. The battery life will give you about six days of use and you can choose from a size five to 13. If your Android phone can run the Samsung Health app, it's compatible with the ring. If you want to access a feature called Energy Score, which gives you a score on your energy level based on sleep, diet, and activity, you'll need a Samsung phone.",
