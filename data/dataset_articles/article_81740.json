  "text": "Global nuclear power capacity is expected to grow significantly over the next decade, according to the World Energy Outlook 2024 by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The report predicts a nearly 20% increase in capacity by 2035, with China leading the expansion, accounting for almost 40% of global additions. Other countries, particularly in emerging markets, are also set to contribute to the growth as they seek reliable and low-emission electricity sources.\nNuclear power, which currently provides around 9% of global electricity, is seen as crucial for nations looking to decarbonize their power systems and enhance grid stability. The IEA highlights the role of nuclear energy in helping countries meet their net-zero targets by 2050.\nWith more reactors set to come online, uranium, the primary fuel used in nuclear plants, is likely to see increased demand. This anticipated growth may put a strain on uranium supply chains, which have been prone to volatility due to geopolitical factors and fluctuating market conditions.\n🤠🐂 #Uranium fuel demand for \" #Nuclear power additions will accelerate over the next decade\"🏎️🔥⛏️🛒 says the International #Energy Agency in their just-released World Energy Outlook 2024 📗🌏⚡⚛️📈🔮👀 45GW added per year => over 22 Million lbs #U3O8 added demand per year!🤯🏄‍♂️ https://t.co/xET2cPixmL pic.twitter.com/CSIyS0U045\n— John Quakes (@quakes99) October 16, 2024 Countries such as Canada, Kazakhstan, and Australia, major producers of uranium, are expected to benefit from this surge in demand. However, the IEA points out the need for stable and resilient supply chains to support this expansion, particularly as new nuclear projects ramp up globally.\nThe report also points to the potential for advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors (SMRs), which could start to come online by 2030, offering more flexibility and scalability in nuclear power generation. These innovations could further boost demand for uranium and other nuclear materials.",
