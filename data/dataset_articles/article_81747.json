  "text": "Tech Druski Discusses The Businesses Of His Ventures — ‘I Self-Fund Everything, And We 100% Own All Of The IP’ October 17, 2024 Edited By Cliche 0 Table of Contents\nDruski is investing in his dreams.\nDruski, born Drew Desbordes in Columbia, MD, began his journey by posting skits on Instagram under the handle druski2funny. The comedian’s social presence has continued to rise. 2020 served as a pivotal year, with his skits generating 1.5 million views and catching the attention of celebrity figures such as Jack Harlow, Odell Beckham Jr., and Drake, making a cameo in the rapper’s “Laugh Now Cry Later” (2020) video, Complex reports.\nOn Instagram alone, Druski’s following has grown to 8.2 million. Additionally, his comedic footprint has led to a net worth exceeding $1 million as of 2023. As AFROTECH™ previously mentioned, the feat is a result of ventures including live shows, tours, and partnerships with companies including teampixel, RGG Studio and SEGA, and PrizePicks.\nDespite his success, being a comedian was not initially a goal post for Druski until he found himself depressed as a student at Georgia Southern University while pursuing a career in broadcast journalism. At the time, he would distract himself with comedy and inspirational videos.\n“I don’t think I’ve been that depressed in my life, other than the semester right before I left,” Druski told Complex. “I watched a lot of Steve Harvey, who talked a lot about jumping and taking [chances]. I was relating to what he was saying. I watched a lot of Gary [Vaynerchuk], Diddy, Kevin Hart, Will Smith.”\nHe would make his exit from the university in 2017, and despite the challenges he faced in pivoting, the journey has paid off and manifested into securing ownership in the industry. He started Coulda Been Records, which is described as a satirical talent show that began in 2020 on Instagram Live. Druski is set to bring the popular show to Lagos, Nigeria, and Afrobeats star Davido appears to be a guest, an Instagram post shows.\nDruski later launched “Coulda Been House,” a TV show set to begin its second season in November 2024, through his 2023-founded company 4Lifers Entertainment, and 4Lifers Sports Agency where Florida Gators star Princely Umanmielen was the first to sign.\nThe comedian will also be expanding his content with the debut of “Coulda Been Love,” a show set to release before Valentine’s Day.\nHis growing footprint is being supported by a personal investment, he revealed to The Hollywood Reporter.\n“I self-fund everything, and we 100 percent own all of the IP for any shows that we do,” Druski said.\nSource link\nAbout Author Cliche I'm an interactive digital experience bringing you the latest in fashion, music, entertainment, art and social media & technology.
