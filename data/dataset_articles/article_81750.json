Although they have already been presented, the new jumpsuits designed by the Italian firm Prada for astronauts, they will not participate in a space mission until 2026. The fashion house teamed up with the space company Axiom Space to create the suits that, logically, offer, in addition to a much more attractive aesthetic, the security needed to return to space. step on the moon\nAs revealed by the Axiom Space company during the International Astronautical Congress held in Milan, the astronauts Those who travel to the Moon in 2026 will do so with “more comfortable and aesthetic suits.” The jumpsuits that they will wear have been made by the Italian fashion house Prada in collaboration with this space company. “Prada’s expertise has enabled the use of advanced technologies and innovative stitching methods to bridge the gap between high engineering and an aesthetically appealing white exterior, offering astronauts a greater comfort and at the same time improving the performance of the materials «, according to a statement from Axiom Space.\nSpace company Axiom Space partnered with the Italian luxury brand to provide the surface suits and spacewalk systems for astronauts participating in the mission to the Atemisa III moon, scheduled for 2026. As explained in the statement issued, along with the first images of the suits, the outer layer of the space suit, designed to reflect heat, is largely white part, as it was in the suits worn by the Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon more than 50 years ago.\nThe jumpsuit designed by Prada that will travel to the Moon in 2026.\nReuters\nThe new ones will have some modifications: such as touches of gray and some red stripes similar to those seen on Italy’s Luna Rossa America’s Cup boat, which was also designed by Prada. Matt Ondler, president of Axiom Space, commented during the presentation that the manufacture of the suit had required “extreme engineering” and “fantastic manufacturing capacity” . “They will go to places that are incredibly dangerous, extreme environments,” he said. He added that “one of the missions that NASA wants to do is to try to find water craters at the South Pole, one of the coldest places in the universe. And that’s why this suit has to be designed very intelligently.”\nThe suit aims to provide maximum comfort to astronauts, while protecting them against radiation, external pressure and providing them with the energy and oxygen they need to perform up to eight hours of moonwalks. Since he is expected to participate in the mission the first woman to step on the moon, the suits are unisex and can be adapted to different sizes.\n“We have combined engineering, science and art to produce the ultimate garments for future moonwalkers, ensuring astronauts can perform their tasks and missions safely and comfortably,” said Russell Ralston, director of the Axiom spacesuit program.\nAs explained in the statement, the design of the boots was a particular challenge, in terms of insulation and making them durable enough for the terrain. But the materials used are « confidential “said Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s marketing director and son of the fashion house’s founder, Miuccia Prada.\n#Haute #couture #reaches #Moon #Italian #brand #Prada",
