  "text": "After decades of a majority of male names among those awarded the National Research Awards the new edition turns the trend around and recognizes for the first time more women than men. Specifically, the awarded researchers represent 70% of the total list, which was announced this Thursday by the Minister of Science, Innovation and Universities (MICIU), Diana Morant. Also parity among the young winners, where the list is distributed equally between female and male names.\nThe awards have 20 modalities worth 30,000 euros each and are “the most important recognition in Spain in the field of scientific research,” according to Morant, who has also added that “excellent science not only contributes to progress and well-being of society, but also to the strengthening of our country.\nThe minister has also stressed that this “is the edition with the highest number of women awarded, since in previous years fewer female researchers were nominated.” This is due, according to the ministry, to the fact that this edition has included “measures to encourage the submission of candidatures by female researchers to the call”, requiring that institutions presenting candidatures would have to opt for at least two candidates, men. and woman. If more were submitted, 40% had to be women. On the other hand, this edition has introduced the participation of the MICIU Women and Science Unit in the 10 jury meetings with the aim of incorporating knowledge in the field of gender and science and avoiding unconscious biases.\nThe minister highlighted that, “for the first time since the awards were announced, two women have been awarded in the categories of Physical, Materials and Earth Sciences and in Medicine”, breaking with a historical anomaly. why women did not have adequate representation in these areas.\nIsabel Fariñas, Eugenio Oñate, Gloria Corpas, Carmen Ayuso, Miquel Canals, María Carmen García, Tomás Torres, Ramón Martínez, Xavier Tolsa and Núria Sebastián have been awarded the National Research Awards, which distinguish those researchers from Spain who They stand out for their career and international relevance in their respective areas of research.\nFor their part, Jerónimo Carlos Rodríguez, Víctor Vilarrasa, Cristina Blanco, Patricia Altea, Rosa María Fernández, Beatriz Pelaz, María Escudero, Aitor Villafranca, Verónica Bolón and Mar Reguant have been awarded the National Research Awards for Young People, which recognize the merit of young people – with a maximum age of 40 years – who have achieved relevant achievements in the early stages of their careers.\nIn the Santiago Ramón y Cajal modality, Isabel Fariñas, professor at the University of Valencia in the department of Cellular Biology, Functional Biology and Physical Anthropology, has been selected. He has received the award for his outstanding scientific career, recognized both nationally and internationally, and the excellence of his research with great social impact.\nHis original contributions to the biology of neurotrophic factors and neural stem cells and their applications to the treatment of neurological diseases stand out.\nFor its part, in the Juan de la Cierva category, the award was given to Ramón Martínez, professor in the Department of Chemistry of the Polytechnic University of Valencia, at the Interuniversitari Research Institute for Molecular Reconeiximent i Desenvolupament Tecnològic (IDM, center mixte UPV-UV).\nThe impact of his scientific career and its transfer in the field of chemistry and, specifically, nanotechnology and its use in sensors for medical, environmental and agri-food applications is highlighted. The jury has valued the high number of patents obtained and licensed by the winner. Likewise, the number of companies it has created is recognized, one of them being the first in the world focused on the development and commercialization of senolytics.\n#time #history #National #Research #Awards #recognize #women #men",
