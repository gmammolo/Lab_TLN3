On the left, an image from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter of several ravines in the Terra Sirenum region of Mars. The right, a ravine in the Martian region of Dao Vallis. The white areas at the edge of the gullies are thought to be areas of dusty ice similar to those modeled in the study NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona\nAn international team of researchers has just published a model according to which the ice accumulated in the mid-latitudes of Mars could allow the development of life . According to the study, recently published in ‘Communications Earth & Environment’, the thickness and…\nSession limit reached Access to Premium content is open courtesy of the establishment you are in, but right now there are too many users logged in at once.
