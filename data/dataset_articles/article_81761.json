  "text": "The Geological and Mining Institute of Spain (IGME-CSIC) will lead the international Génesis consortium, an ambitious project that seeks to address the challenges in freshwater management caused by climate change through solutions based on nature and technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) or the creation of so-called ‘digital twins’ (virtual replicas capable of emulating the operation of a physical asset in the virtual environment) of critical water infrastructures. Coordinated by IGME-CSIC researcher Alejandro García Gil, the project will have a budget of more than 10.5 million euros, a historic milestone for this scientific organization since, for the first time, it is leading an initiative of this magnitude.\nGénesis (Geologically Enhanced NaturE-based Solutions for Climate Change Resiliency of Critical Water Infrastructure) will bring together a consortium of internationally renowned specialists and entities, with a total of 19 partners from six different countries (Spain, Portugal, Cape Verde, Belgium , Greece and France). They will work together to implement strategic solutions that improve groundwater management, especially in the regions most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as the oceanic islands of Maraconesia (Canary Islands, Azores, Madeira, Cape Verde and the Savage Islands). ), where it is a limited and increasingly scarce resource. The initiative will take place between September 1 of this year and August 31, 2028.\nGiven that alterations in climatic conditions can have more negative effects on the volume of water available on islands than in continental environments, the protection of water infrastructure is today a priority, and Génesis aims to demonstrate that innovative nature-based solutions can improve their climate resilience. These are infrastructures that capture and store water (such as wells or underground galleries), wastewater ponds, wastewater treatment systems, systems that protect against extreme events (such as dams or barriers that mitigate flooding) or aquifer monitoring methods. , among others. In short, it is about effectively protecting subsoil water, improving the efficiency of its use and reusing as much as possible, also supporting social and economic activities.\nTo do this, what has been called “Deep demonstrator” will be developed, which not only demonstrates the impact of a small-scale nature-based solution, but will corroborate that nature-based proposals can work, not only on small islands, but in real large-scale conditions, so they can be integrated into island and European hydraulic infrastructures. In fact, the objective is that research in Macaronesia can be replicated in other vulnerable areas of the European Union.\nUse of all the water\nAt Génesis, a methodology has been designed that includes the entire cycle in a real operating environment, from how to capture and store water to how to protect it effectively. To achieve this, the aforementioned digital twins and AI technologies are used jointly, which allow for management adapted to the changing conditions of the environment. On the other hand, nature-based solutions include proposals such as developing infrastructure to harness water sources, such as storm runoff, treated wastewater, or irrigation return flows. “The objective is to mitigate the impacts of extreme events such as droughts, floods and forest fires and create climate resilient islands,” says García Gil.\nIt is expected that the development and subsequent implementation of these actions will favor a reduction in runoff and the consequent soil erosion, while improving water infiltration. Working with local communities will be essential, so that they implement the most efficient water management possible, so that it is sustainable over time.\n“The IGME-CSIC is proud to lead this global effort that will contribute to developing more efficient and adaptable hydraulic infrastructures, ensuring a more sustainable and resilient future for the affected communities,” concludes García Gil.\n#Genesis #improve #water #management",
