  "text": "Telephone takes a leap with its full entry into the cryptocurrency business. The telecom has announced a new virtual wallet from Bit2Me for the management of cryptocurrencies. He has thus presented the application Your Wallet which serves “to manage crypto assets in a simple and transparent way.”\n«This cryptocurrency wallet allows users to buy, sell, send and pay with a selection of cryptocurrencies that have the highest business volume in the market. The service is operated entirely by Bit2Me the first Spanish exchange registered with the Bank of Spain,” the company has indicated.\nLikewise, this is Telefónica’s first big move to bring the crypto world closer to consumers, but before they had already taken a small step in this segment. Precisely, they are shareholders of Bit2Me, the operator with which they are now partnering to launch this wallet.\nTelefónica adds that the ‘app’ “offers an accessible, secure and simple experience. It is now available for Android and iOS and to operate it will only be necessary to download the application and register with an email address and a mobile phone number. The service is aimed at any customer with a Spanish mobile number regardless of the operator of which they are a customer. The company has clarified that it will not be necessary to be a Telefónica customer but that the virtual wallet is open to the public.\nLikewise, the application gives the user a virtual card in collaboration with Mastercard with which the consumer can make payments with the cryptocurrencies they have stored. At the time of making the transaction, the ‘app’ itself converts the cryptocurrency to be able to pay the equivalent in euros.\n“Your Wallet is thus incorporated into the catalog of services and solutions of tu.com, Telefónica Innovación Digital’s commercial platform to offer the company’s most cutting-edge technological products and services,” Telefónica reported. Chema Alonso, chief digital officer of Telefónica and CEO of Telefónica Innovación Digital, stated during the presentation: «Tu.com is the platform that allows us to innovate in over-the-top digital products and services and bring them to the market quickly. It is, in reality, an incubator for innovation projects that allows us to be more disruptive and test new products that we market directly throughout the world and that we can eventually integrate into the offering of our commercial brands in the countries where Telefónica operates.\n#Telefónica #fully #enters #crypto #business #launches #virtual #wallet",
