  "text": "Yellow Brick Games’ action-adventure title Eternal Strands has looked impressive in its pre-launch showings thus far, and at the recent Xbox Partner Preview showcase, the developer once again showed off the title with a new trailer- and yes, it continues to look promising.\nEternal Strands will boast explosive, frantic combat that will see players commanding a variety of different magical abilities, from command over fire and ice elemental attacks to being able to telekinetically throw anything and everything (including yourself). Interactivity also seems to be a huge focal point here, so when the game says you can, for instance, burn or freeze everything, it seems like it means everything .\nOf course, as past trailers have confirmed, boss battles against gigantic enemies towering over you will also be a big part of Eternal Strands , and we see plenty of glimpses of that in this trailer as well, with the game continuing to show shades of Shadow of the Colossus . Check out the trailer below.\nEternal Strands is due out in early 2025 for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. Yellow Brick Games has also announced that the game will be available via Game Pass day one.",
