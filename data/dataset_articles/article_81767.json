  "text": "Presumably still riding high from the successful launch of its Silent Hill 2 remake, which sold over one million copies in its first week, Bloober Team has announced a new sci-fi survival horror game. Cronos: The New Dawn is an all-new horror experience from a studio with a great grasp of the genre. (Its past titles speak for themselves — Layers of Fear, anyone?) While Bloober Team has experience handling existing properties in survival horror games, Cronos: The New Dawn is the developer’s first attempt at original IP in the survival horror genre. It is set to launch for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox next year.\nRelated reading: DDNet Editor-in-Chief Matt wrote a glowing review of the Silent Hill 2 remake, concluding, “I am now convinced that absolutely no one on the planet loves any video game more than the entire team at Bloober Team loves Silent Hill 2.”\nCronos: The New Dawn is set in a grim world; think Eastern European Brutalism meets retro-futurist technology. The gripping story has you trying to survive a nightmarish future to save what’s left of the past. As a Traveler (and an agent for the Collective), search the wastelands of the future for time rifts that will bring you to a 19080s-era Poland where the world is suffering a cataclysmic event that altered humanity forever.\nIn the future, fight for survival against abominations that will test your reflexes and tactical skills. In the past, you must locate key people who died during the event, use your Harvester to extract their Essences, and have them come with you in the future.\nStrategy is key to your survival. The danger never ends, so you must strategize and be prepared for anything. Nightmarish creatures born from the remnants of humanity are your enemies; it will take everything you’ve got to defeat them. While in battle, the difference between life and death is one quick decision.\n“Following the success of Silent Hill 2, we are proud to present Cronos, an exciting new IP from Bloober Team,” said Piotr Babieno, CEO of Bloober Team, in a press release. “Our commitment to redefining the horror genre continues with this survival horror title, which represents a natural progression of our creative vision and our studio’s strategy. By merging the eerie atmosphere of horror with the boundless potential of science fiction, Cronos promises to deliver a fresh survival experience. We can’t wait to share it with the world in 2025.”\nDeveloped and published by Bloober Team, Cronos: The New Dawn will be released for PC via Steam/Microsoft, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series in 2025.\nBuy the hottest games with Amazon.\nBy purchasing from this link, you support DDNet.\nEach sale earns us a small commission.",
