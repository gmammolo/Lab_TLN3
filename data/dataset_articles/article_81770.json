  "text": "This Thursday afternoon at New York Comic Con, HBO announced that Dune: Prophecy — its TV series (greatly) pre-dating the film franchise — will premiere Sunday, Nov. 17 at 9/8c.\nA full trailer was also released, seen above, that better lays out the conflicts brewing for the fabled sisterhood that will become known as the Bene Gesserit.\nOrdered to series back in June 2019 — before the streamer formerly known as HBO Max had any name, and well ahead of Dune: Part One ‘s October 2021 release — the six-episode Dune: Prophecy is set 10,000 years before the ascension of Paul Atreides (played by Timothée Chalamet in the film franchise). It follows two Harkonnen sisters — played by Olivia Williams ( Counterpart ) and Emily Watson ( Chernobyl ) — as they combat forces that threaten the future of humankind.\nDune: Prophecy is inspired by the novel Sisterhood of Dune , written by Dune author Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.\nThe Dune: Prophecy cast also includes Jodhi May ( The Witcher ) as Empress Natalya, a formidable royal who united thousands of worlds in her marriage to Emperor Corrin; Travis Fimmel ( Vikings ) as Desmond Hart, a charismatic soldier with an enigmatic past; Mark Strong ( Temple ) as Emperor Javicco Corrin; plus Sarah-Sofie Boussnina ( Knightfall ), Shalom Brune-Franklin ( The Tourist ), Aoife Hinds ( Normal People ), Chloe Lea ( Foundation ), Josh Heuston ( Heartbreak High ), Edward Davis ( Sanditon ), Jade Anouka ( His Dark Materials ), Yerin Ha ( Halo ) and Faoileann Cunningham ( The Northman ).\nAlso of note, Indian superstar Tabu will recur as Sister Francesca , once a great love of the Emperor, The End of the F**king World ‘s Jessica Barden will play a young version of Watson’s character, and South Korean actress/musician Jihae will guest-star as Reverend Mother Kasha, the Emperor’s Truthsayer and confidant.\nAlison Schapker ( Altered Carbon , Westworld ) serves as showrunner on the series, ever since a February 2023 creative shift .\n“The Bene Gesserit have always been fascinating to me,” Denis Villeneuve, director of the Dune films and an EP on Dune: Prophecy , said back in 2019. “Focusing a series around that powerful order of women seemed not only relevant and inspiring, but a dynamic setting for the television series.”\nWant scoop on Dune: Prophecy , or for any other TV show ?
