  "text": "The naval combat trailer for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, shows ship to ship combat out in the open sea and in a large coliseum, ship boarding with combat, and the ship customisation menu. It also gives us a look at the pirate haven Madlantis, ruled over by Queen Michele. Her and her top team run the Pirate Coliseum which hosts the Tournament of Captains, as well as other events including Quick Skirmish, Madlantis Mania, and Swashbuckler Showdown. The story itself sees Goro Majima washes up on a remote island with no memories at all, not even his name. He embarks on a new adventure with teenage islander Noah to regain those memories and get ahead in this topsy-turvy world. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has also confirmed a new release date for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, with the game now set to be released on February 21st, 2025, bringing the release date forward by a week from the original date. It will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Source: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/P4nQLCCQnq8?si=GejzSndy6rlbRZ-1)",
