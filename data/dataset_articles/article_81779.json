  "text": "Testing uranium levels in various household items, analyzing materials through a high-powered microscope, and launching film canisters into the air with a chemical reaction were some of the activities at the Fête de la Science (Science Festival) at McMaster University on October 10. For only the fifth time outside of France, a Canadian institution hosted this youth-focused science event. McMaster welcomed more than 100 grade-school children from neighbouring communities and their families to the gathering. Jointly hosted by McMaster’s Office of International Affairs and the Faculties of Engineering and Science, in partnership with the Consulate of France in Canada, the Fête focused on the theme: Oceans of Knowledge. As Bertrand Pous, the Consul General of France in Toronto, explains, “The Fête de la Science is not just about celebrating scientific achievements; it is about inspiring the next generation of researchers, thinkers, and innovators.” Complementing the activities were two lectures by water researchers. Sarah Dickson-Anderson, professor of civil engineering and associate dean, undergraduate in the Faculty of Engineering, presented on strengthening water security in Canada’s rural, remote, and marginalized communities. Muriel Véron, Professor and Deputy Director of Phelma – the School of Engineering in Physics, Applied Physics, Electronics, and Material Science at the Grenoble Institute of Technology, presented a lecture on how the ocean connects people. Véron traveled from France to be part of the festivities, marking her return to McMaster, where she was previously a post-doctoral research associate in materials science and engineering. “The Fête symbolized McMaster’s commitment to the global exchange of knowledge for the benefit of the communities we serve,” said Bonny Ibhawoh, Vice-Provost, International Affairs at McMaster. “We were delighted to partner with the French Consulate of Canada on this educational initiative.” Wrapping up the Fête were tours for guests led by McMaster Engineering student ambassadors, featuring stops at the planetarium, the new greenhouse and the Hatch build space where Engineering clubs and teams work on their projects for competition. Earlier in the day, an awards ceremony was held for the presentation of[ l’Ordre des Palmes Académiques to Hatem Zurob,](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/news/professor-hatem-zurob-inducted-to-frances-order-of-academic-palms/) professor and chair in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.",
