Gregory Smith, with assisting in a quick knockdown of the small electrical fire in a home along Route 981 just outside New Alexandria.\n“They used a garden hose and kept the fire in check,” Kolano said.\nThe fire was sparked at about 8 a.m. by a toaster oven while the homeowner was making breakfast, according to Kolano.\nThe Smiths helped the man and his dog safely exit the home as firefighting crews were dispatched from several area departments — including New Alexandria, Bradenville, Crabtree, Blairsville, Tunnelton and Saltsburg.\n“Probably some restoration will be needed to the house, but there was no major damage,” Kolano said. “We used a minimal amount of water. There was some smoke damage in the kitchen and dining room.”\nHe said the homeowner will be temporarily staying with a family member.\nAt about 9:30 a.m., just as the first responders were finishing work at the Derry Township site, another electrical fire was reported, at a home on Route 819 in Salem.\nSince their trucks already were manned and on the road, many departments headed directly to the Salem fire before being officially dispatched.\n“They got on the scene and all did a great job,” said Forbes Road fire Chief Bob Rosatti, who was in charge at the Salem blaze.\nA utility meter was on fire on the outside of that house and spread flames to some adjacent siding and wood sheeting before firefighters were able to douse them, Rosatti said.\nTwo residents got out of the home safely, he said. West Penn Power remotely disconnected electric service and sent a technician to the scene, Rosatti said.\nNo injuries were reported in either of the fires.\nJeff Himler is a TribLive reporter covering Greater Latrobe, Ligonier Valley, Mt.
