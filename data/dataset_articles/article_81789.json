  "text": "Ours is an industry where announcements of games getting delayed never seem to take anyone by surprise, on account of how frequently they happen- which is why it’s always nice to find an outlier. Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku recently showcased a new gameplay trailer for the upcoming Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii , and announced that the action-adventure title’s release has also been brought forward by a week.\nNow, in a separate video, RGG Studio head Masayoshi Yokoyama has elaborated on the reasons behind the game releasing a week ahead of time, explaining that development is actually going better than the studio had planned.\nInterestingly enough, however, Yokoyama also seems to suggest that the game’s release date would change so that it would no longer clash with Monster Hunter Wilds , which releases on February 28, the day that Like a Dragon was previously set to come out. Of course, he did not specifically name the Capcom action RPG, but stated that RGG Studio and Sega wants players to be able to play “the game that comes after it, with peace of mind.”\n“We have decided to bring forward the release date by a week to February 21, 2025,” Yokoyama said. “Of course, this is partly because development is progressing more smoothly than expected, but we also wanted to deliver the game to players around the world as soon as possible. We wanted you to be able to play the game that comes after it, with peace of mind. With the support of everyone involved at Sega, both internal and external, we have been able to make this a reality.”\nUpon its release in February, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC.",
