  "text": "Ukraine increases drone production tenfold - Ministry of Digital Transformation Ukraine has increased drone production tenfold in 2024 compared to 2023. The priority has shifted to efficiency and cutting-edge technologies, according to the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine. The Ministry conducted a study on the drone production industry together with the Kyiv School of Economics and the Brave1 cluster. \"Ukraine’s drone industry’s production capacity increased by over 10 times in 2024 compared to 2023,\" the report stated. According to the Ministry, production capacity grew from 300,000 units in 2023 to 4 million units in 2024. The Ministry also noted that after establishing mass production, the priority shifted toward efficiency and cutting-edge technology. Experts predict that competition will lead to a consolidation of manufacturers in the coming years. \"Significant progress has been made in the development of aerial, marine, and ground drones, as well as electronic warfare systems. Key trends include the use of computer vision, 'swarm' technologies, and innovations in navigation and communication,\" the Ministry added. Drone production in Ukraine Since the beginning of the full-scale war, Ukraine has increased production of various types of drones. Drones are produced by both state-owned and private companies. Ukraine produces not only quadcopters but also strike and reconnaissance drones, as well as marine drones. According to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, [Ukraine has the capacity to produce 4 million drones per year](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/ukraine-can-produce-4-million-drones-annually-1727807656.html).",
