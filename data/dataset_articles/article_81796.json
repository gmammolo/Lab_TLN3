  "text": "During the Xbox Partner Preview event held on October 17, 2024, several highly anticipated games and expansions were revealed, giving gamers a glimpse of what to expect in the near future. From horror to sci-fi to quirky indie titles, here’s a breakdown of the most notable announcements. Wake 2: The Lake House DLC Fans of the psychological horror series Alan Wake were treated to a preview of the upcoming DLC, The Lake House. This expansion promises to dial up the horror, offering a more intense and dark experience just in time for its October 2024 release. Perfectly aligned with the Halloween season, this content is poised to give players a chilling new chapter in Alan Wake’s saga. Chronos: The New Dawn Bloober Team, the developers behind the Silent Hill 2 remake, introduced their new sci-fi horror project, Chronos: The New Dawn. The trailer teased an unsettling story featuring a bloodied monster hunter and a grandmother playing chess, suggesting a deeply eerie narrative. Slated for a 2025 release on PC and Xbox, Chronos looks to be a unique blend of psychological and cosmic horror. Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Taking the Yakuza series in a bold new direction, Like a Dragon transports players to Hawaii with a surprising pirate theme. This mix of magical realism and pirate adventure offers a vibrant and bonkers (which is very on-brand) twist to the franchise. Subnautica 2 The deep-sea survival horror game Subnautica is getting a sequel, and its reveal left fans eager for more. While the showcase only featured a cinematic trailer, Subnautica 2 promises to expand on the original’s tense underwater exploration. Set for early access in 2025 and available on Game Pass, the game will once again immerse players in the alien depths of a terrifying ocean world. Phasmophobia The hit ghost-hunting game Phasmophobia will be making its way to Xbox, launching on October 29, 2024. This highly popular co-op horror game has been a PC favorite and is expected to gain a new audience with its console release, just in time for Halloween. Mouse: P.I. For Hire A standout indie title from the showcase, Mouse: P.I. For Hire combines classic noir detective storytelling with fast-paced shooter mechanics. The game’s unique art style, reminiscent of 2D Disney cartoons, offers a nostalgic yet fresh take on the genre. It’s set to release in 2025 for Xbox Series X|S and PC. FBC: Firebreak One of the biggest surprises of the event was the announcement of FBC: Firebreak, a multiplayer co-op shooter set in the Control and Alan Wake universe. Developed by Remedy Entertainment, this game marks the studio’s first foray into multiplayer gameplay. Set in Control’s iconic Oldest House, players will team up to battle the Hiss, introducing a new dynamic to Remedy’s shared universe. It’s scheduled for a 2025 release on Xbox Series X|S and PC.
