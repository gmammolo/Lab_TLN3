  "text": "SpaceX is seeking approval for changes to Starlink that the company says will enable gigabits-per-second broadband service. in a application submitted to the US Federal Communications Commission on October 11, SpaceX claims The “requested modification and accompanying amendment will enable the Gen2 system to deliver gigabit-speed broadband, truly low-latency broadband, and ubiquitous mobile connectivity to all Americans and the billions of people around the world who still lack access to adequate broadband.\nSpaceX said it is pursuing “several small but significant updates to the orbital configuration and operating parameters for the authorization of its Gen2 space station to improve space sustainability, better respond to changing demand, and share spectrum more efficiently with other space users.” spectrum”.\nSpaceX wants to reduce the altitude of the satellites “from 525 km, 530 km and 535 km to 480 km, 485 km and 475 km altitude, respectively.” The reconfiguration will increase the “potential maximum number of orbital aircraft and satellites per aircraft” and keep the total planned number of second-generation satellites at 29,988 or less. The FCC so far approved 7,500 Gen2 satellites.\nElon Musk, CEO of SpaceX wrote On Monday, “next-generation Starlink satellites, which are so large that only Starship can launch them, will enable a 10-fold increase in bandwidth and, with reduced altitude, faster latency.”\nSpaceX promised gigabit speeds in 2016, when the satellite system was just in the planning stages and didn’t even have a name yet. “Once fully optimized through final deployment, the system will be able to provide high bandwidth (up to 1 Gbps per user) and low-latency broadband services to consumers and businesses in the US and around the world.” SpaceX told the FCC in November 2016.\nAs for actual speeds in 2024, Starlink website says that “users typically experience download speeds between 25 and 220 Mbps, with most users experiencing speeds greater than 100 Mbps. Upload speeds are typically between 5 and 20 Mbps. Latency ranges from 25 to 60 ms on land, and more than 100 ms in certain remote locations.”\nChange satellite elevation angles Another request would change satellite elevation angles to improve network performance, SpaceX said. “SpaceX is seeking to reduce its minimum elevation angle from 25 degrees to 20 degrees for satellites operating between 400 and 500 kilometers altitude,” SpaceX told the FCC. “Reducing the minimum elevation angle in this way will improve customer connectivity by allowing satellites to connect directly to more ground stations and maintain connections with ground stations for a longer period of time while flying overhead.”\nMeanwhile, upgrades to Starlink’s Gen2 satellites “will feature improved hardware that can utilize higher gain and more advanced beamforming and digital processing technologies and provide more targeted and robust coverage for U.S. consumers,” SpaceX said. .\nSpaceX is also seeking more flexible use of spectrum licenses to support its planned mobile service and current home Internet service. The company requested permission “to use Ka, V and E band frequencies for fixed or mobile satellite use cases where the US or International Frequency Allocation Table allows such dual use and where the antenna parameters would be indistinguishable.” “.",
