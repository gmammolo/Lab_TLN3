  "text": "Markey forges global alliance for cancer research LEXINGTON, Ky. (Oct. 17, 2024) — The [University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center](https://ukhealthcare.uky.edu/markey-cancer-center) helped launch the [Global Cancer Consortium](https://glocacon.org/), an innovative partnership uniting top cancer centers across continents. The new group is advancing cancer research, education, and patient care to tackle one of the world's most pressing health challenges. In 2020, Markey researcher Vivek Rangnekar, Ph.D., leveraged his international connections to create a new network for research collaboration and brought together cancer centers from the U.S. and India. The founding members included Markey, Mayo Clinic, Saroj Gupta Cancer Centre & Research Institute, Tata Memorial Centre, and Manipal Academy of Higher Education. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, the new network thrived as scientists across the world embraced virtual collaboration. When lockdowns closed labs and canceled academic conferences, the consortium became an avenue to keep researchers connected and students engaged, says Rangnekar, a professor and Alfred Cohen Chair in Oncology Research in the [UK College of Medicine](https://medicine.uky.edu/). “The pandemic accelerated our ability to connect across borders,” said Rangnekar. “Suddenly, everyone was comfortable with video calls and online collaboration. It opened new possibilities for us.” Today, the consortium has grown to eight member institutions, adding China Medical University in Taiwan, Brown University Legorreta Cancer Center and University of Kansas Cancer Center. It operates through chapters in North America, South Asia, East Asia, Europe and partner institutions in Brazil. Fostering education and collaboration Through the consortium, researchers and clinicians at member institutions can access a number of online and in-person educational seminars and conferences. The network also offers certificate programs, including a cardio-oncology certification developed with the International Cardio Oncology Society. The consortium’s annual in-person conference attracts researchers from six continents. These innovative programs have also served as a way for participants from different disciplines, institutions and parts of the world to connect. Research collaborations fostered by the consortium have already led to breakthroughs in the lab, which have been published in more than 15 research articles. Two of these articles are published in a high-impact journal. [One study](https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12943-023-01916-6) described 3D models of cancer cells, highlighting a promising way to identify new targets for drug development and help doctors choose better treatments faster. [Another collaborative research project](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37947608/) suggested a new way to predict outcomes for cervical cancer patients, which could be developed to help doctors better determine patients that may need more aggressive treatments. These joint efforts are helping the network grow by opening doors to more funding opportunities, says Mahadev Rao, Ph.D., a Global Cancer Consortium founding member at Manipal University in India. “Our faculty have actively participated in the consortium, which has enriched the collaborative atmosphere within our institution, leading to new research projects and grants working with physicians and translational research scientists across continents, resulting in joint publications,” said Rao. “Our teamwork has also inspired our graduate students and junior faculty to engage more enthusiastically in our collaborative efforts.” Global reach, local impact The consortium also focuses on community outreach and training the next generation of cancer researchers. Some of Kentucky’s successful approaches to cancer education and outreach are being adapted for use in diverse communities around the world. Many regions served by consortium members face challenges similar to those in Kentucky, such as limited access to cancer care in rural areas and the need for culturally sensitive education programs. The consortium’s Youth Science Program is modeled after Markey’s successful [Appalachian Career Training in Oncology (ACTION)](http://ukhealthcare.uky.edu/markey-cancer-center/research/action) program. ACTION provides hands-on laboratory experiences and mentorship to students from Appalachian Kentucky, helping to build a diverse pipeline of oncology professionals. The Youth Science Program adapts and expands this model for international multi-institutional settings, introducing high school and college students to cancer biology concepts and research methods while exploring the disease’s emotional and societal impacts through art activities and family discussions. Another example is a cervical cancer education and screening program in rural India, inspired by similar outreach efforts in Kentucky. This program brings cancer screenings to women who might not otherwise have access. “We’ve found that many of the strategies that work in Kentucky can be tailored to make an impact in other communities,” said Rangnekar. “Whether it’s reaching rural populations or engaging young people in cancer research, the principles are often the same — it’s about making the science accessible and relevant to local communities.” Ensuring long-term success Rangnekar and consortium colleagues have put measures in place to ensure the continuity of the consortium and its mission. The network features a tiered leadership system, including a board of trustees, an executive committee, and a youth leadership group. It also employs a “train the trainer” framework, where experienced members mentor the next generation of leaders. “The Global Cancer Consortium has brought numerous benefits back to Markey,” Rangnekar said. “Our international visibility has increased. The knowledge exchange with our global partners enhances our own practices and research capabilities, making us better equipped to serve patients in Kentucky and address cancer challenges both at home and worldwide.” UK HealthCare is the hospitals and clinics of the University of Kentucky. But it is so much more. It is more than 10,000 dedicated health care professionals committed to providing advanced subspecialty care for the most critically injured and ill patients from the Commonwealth and beyond. It also is the home of the state’s only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, a Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit that cares for the tiniest and sickest newborns, the region’s only Level 1 trauma center and Kentucky’s top hospital ranked by U.S. News & World Report. As an academic research institution, we are continuously pursuing the next generation of cures, treatments, protocols and policies. Our discoveries have the potential to change what’s medically possible within our lifetimes. Our educators and thought leaders are transforming the health care landscape as our six health professions colleges teach the next generation of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other health care professionals, spreading the highest standards of care. UK HealthCare is the power of advanced medicine committed to creating a healthier Kentucky, now and for generations to come.",
