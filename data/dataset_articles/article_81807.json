  "text": "Surgeons at UC San Diego Health now use Apple’s Vision Pro headset for minimally invasive surgeries, marking a major step in medical AR technology. Dr. Santiago Horgan, a leader in robotic surgery, believes the Vision Pro could be as transformative as previous advances. Over the last month, he and his team have used the headset in more than 20 procedures, including acid-reflux and obesity surgeries.\nEnhancing Precision and Reducing Strain\nThe Vision Pro displays vital information within the surgeon’s view, eliminating the need to look away from the patient. In traditional laparoscopic surgery, surgeons must use separate monitors for camera feeds and patient data, which can cause strain. With the Vision Pro, they can see multiple virtual screens—such as CT scans and heart rate monitors—all in one view. Dr. Horgan notes this setup has improved his accuracy and reduced physical discomfort.\nCost-Effective for Hospitals\nThe Vision Pro’s $3,499 price may seem high for consumers but is much less than standard medical monitors, which can cost up to $30,000. Dr. Christopher Longhurst, Chief Innovation Officer at UC San Diego Health, views this affordability as a significant advantage, especially for smaller hospitals. The device’s lower cost could allow more facilities to adopt advanced technology without a high financial burden.\nThe Future of AR in Medicine\nWhile the Vision Pro is not yet FDA-approved for widespread medical use, UC San Diego Health plans to continue its trials. Dr. Longhurst expects AR headsets like the Vision Pro to become standard in operating rooms worldwide. Early results show promise, suggesting AR technology could improve patient outcomes and assist healthcare professionals.\nApple’s Vision Pro isn’t the only AR device in the medical field. Other companies, like Augmedics and Vuzix, also offer headsets for surgical assistance. However, the Vision Pro stands out for its compatibility with existing systems, making it easier to integrate. As Apple and other tech companies continue to innovate, AR’s role in healthcare will likely expand, changing how surgeries are performed.",
