  "text": "Apple’s anticipated iPhone SE 4 may play a pivotal role in promoting the company’s Apple Intelligence technology. Set to launch in early 2025, the iPhone SE 4 aims to attract budget-conscious customers while introducing them to features from Apple’s flagship devices. Analysts believe that offering Apple Intelligence on a lower-cost model will help Apple reach a broader audience.\nTargeting the Affordable Market\nThe iPhone SE series has long appealed to users looking for an affordable entry into the Apple ecosystem. With the SE 4, Apple is expected to continue this trend, but with upgrades that set it apart from previous models. According to Morgan Stanley, the SE 4 will borrow features from the iPhone 14, such as an OLED display. With these improvements and Apple Intelligence, the SE 4 could become a strong alternative to older models on the market.\nExpanding Apple Intelligence\nApple Intelligence, Apple’s AI-driven technology, enhances user experience through personalization and predictive capabilities. By integrating this tech into the SE 4, Apple allows more users to experience its benefits. Analysts predict that Apple could sell 15 to 20 million SE 4 units due to the appeal of this feature alone.\nA Strategic Move for Apple\nAdding Apple Intelligence to a budget-friendly model could drive adoption and attract new users. Given that iPhone 16 sales have fallen short of expectations, the SE 4 offers a valuable opportunity for Apple to capture market share in the lower-cost smartphone segment. Moreover, the SE 4 may attract not only existing Apple users but also Android users considering a switch.\nOverall, the iPhone SE 4’s blend of affordability and advanced features reflects Apple’s strategy to make its technology accessible to a wider audience. If these predictions hold true, the SE 4 could help Apple succeed with Apple Intelligence and bring in millions of new customers in 2025.",
