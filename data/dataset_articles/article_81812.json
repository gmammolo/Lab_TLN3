  "text": "Apple’s Car Key feature, which lets users unlock and start cars with an iPhone or Apple Watch, will soon support Audi, Volvo, and Polestar. Recent code discoveries in iOS updates reveal Apple’s plans to expand Car Key compatibility. This move increases convenience for drivers of these brands, as Apple strengthens its integration with major automakers.\nExpanding Car Key’s Reach\nCurrently, Car Key works with select models from BMW, Hyundai, Genesis, BYD, and Kia. With the addition of Audi, Volvo, and Polestar, Apple aims to reach a broader audience. Car Key uses Near Field Communication (NFC) technology and stores digital keys in the Apple Wallet app. Users can lock, unlock, and start their vehicles simply by having their devices nearby.\nSimplifying Vehicle Access\nCar Key enhances convenience by allowing users to unlock their vehicles just by standing near them. It also boosts security, removing the need for traditional keys. This feature reflects Apple’s role in the growing market for connected car technology. By offering Car Key support, Apple meets the needs of tech-savvy drivers who prefer digital solutions.\nLooking Ahead\nThe exact timing for this expansion is still unknown, but the code references suggest that Apple is actively working on it. As more car brands adopt Car Key, Apple could further establish itself in automotive tech. Audi, Volvo, and Polestar drivers can look forward to a more seamless driving experience with Apple’s Car Key in the near future.",
