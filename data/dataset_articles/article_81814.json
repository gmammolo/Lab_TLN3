(NASDAQ: SUPN), a biopharmaceutical firm dedicated to addressing central nervous system (CNS) disorders, has recently unveiled remarkable data from its exploratory open-label Phase 2a clinical study concerning SPN-820 and its effects on adults experiencing major depressive disorder (MDD). This landmark study indicates rapid improvement in depressive symptoms, providing hope for those suffering from this challenging mental health condition. Overview of the Phase 2a Study The Phase 2a clinical trial involved a total of 40 participants, with 38 completing the treatment over a 10-day period. The main goal was to assess the safety and effectiveness of SPN-820, which was administered in a dosage of 2400 mg every three days in combination with existing antidepressant treatments. The findings have illustrated significant changes in patients' mental health within a short timeframe. Key Findings of the Study Results that emerged from the analysis were both encouraging and statistically significant: - Within two hours, patients experienced a clinically relevant improvement of -6.1 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-6 (HAM-D6) and -9.6 by Day 10. - On the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), scores improved by -16.6 at four hours, reaching -22.9 by Day 10. - Remarkably, suicidal ideation saw an 80% decrease, dropping from 12.5% among participants at the outset to just 2.6% by the end of the study. - What’s more, SPN-820 demonstrated a high level of tolerability among participants, with very few adverse effects reported, leading to only a 2.5% discontinuation rate. - Common side effects included headaches, feelings of nausea, drowsiness, and dizziness, while other minor effects were also noted. Insights from Leadership Jack Khattar, President and CEO of Supernus, expressed optimism about SPN-820's potential. He noted, \"These Phase 2a data reinforce our belief that SPN-820 may emerge as a new viable treatment option for depression, showing rapid effectiveness without the typical adverse effects. Our goal is to complete patient enrollment for the Phase 2b randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study soon.” Future Webcast Discussion Additionally, Supernus will hold a conference call and live webcast to discuss these findings in detail. Stakeholders and the general public can find this important information on the Company’s Investor Relations platform. About SPN-820 SPN-820 is an innovative oral therapeutic designed to augment mTORC1 activity within the brain, aiming to enhance synaptic functioning. This new treatment avenue is particularly promising due to its ability to induce rapid-onset antidepressant responses, setting it apart from traditional treatments that may take longer to show effectiveness. About Supernus Pharmaceuticals Supernus Pharmaceuticals continues to evolve its extensive portfolio, which already includes several approved medications treating conditions such as epilepsy, migraine, and ADHD. The ongoing research aims to expand their offerings into other CNS disorders, reinforcing their commitment to improving mental health and quality of life for patients.
