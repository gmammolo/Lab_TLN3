  "text": "The innovation is known to be more efficient than servos (electric motors) in terms of energy saving. In this work, a construction of oil-filled polymer tubes was used. The result is an electrohydraulic actuator. According to the scientific journal Nature Communications (NatComms), the design is driven by electrodes made of conductive material, which, when voltage is applied, are magnetized to each other due to static electricity. The action of the “muscles” resembles their analog in living nature. That is, one muscle contracts, and the other, on the contrary, lengthens. The work is controlled by special software. It is noteworthy that the energy efficiency of the new system is much better compared to servo drives. Since a motorized limb has to expend a lot of energy to maintain its position. Also, electrohydraulics is better adapted under dynamic loads and does not require the installation of sensors to track the angles of flexion of the robot limbs. Earlier it became known that a British school has created a classroom where artificial intelligence will replace teachers.",
