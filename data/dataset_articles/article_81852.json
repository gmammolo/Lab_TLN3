  "text": "BEAT Appoints Passionate New CEO Robert Eno with Multiple Breakthrough Products and Over 30 Years Bio Industry Experience • Creating First Ever Cable-Free 12-Lead ECG Capable of Capturing Cardiac Electrical Signals from Three Dimensions.\n• Technology Designed for Portable Devices to Deliver Actionable Heart Intelligence Anywhere.\n• New CEO Appointed in Preparation for US Commercialization with Extensive Experience Developing Go-To-Market Strategies for Breakthrough Products.\n• Founder Branislav Vajdic Named President to Focus on Advancing Groundbreaking Vector-Based Technology Including AI Applications.\n• Appointed Chief AI Scientist, Former Head of Data Science at Verily (Google Life Sciences) and Global Authority on AI Applications in Biosensor Technologies.\nHeartBeam, Inc. (NASDAQ: BEAT) is a medical technology company dedicated to transforming cardiac care by providing powerful cardiac insights wherever the patient is. BEAT is creating the first ever cable-free 12-lead ECG capable of capturing the heart’s electrical signals from three dimensions. This BEAT platform technology is designed to be used in portable devices that can be used wherever the patient is to deliver actionable heart intelligence. Physicians will be able to identify cardiac health trends and acute conditions and direct patients to the appropriate care – all outside of a medical facility, thus redefining the future of cardiac health management. BEAT holds 13 US and 4 international issued patents related to technology enablement.\nBEAT Appoints Robert Eno as Chief Executive Officer in Preparation for US Commercialization\nOn October 17th BEAT announced that Robert Eno has been appointed Chief Executive Officer (CEO), effective Monday, October 21, 2024. The seasoned MedTech executive joined BEAT as President in January 2023 and will lead as the Company continues to work towards securing the foundational FDA 510(k) clearance for its vector-based technology and prepares for commercialization and growth.\nAs part of the long-planned transition, Branislav Vajdic, Ph.D., BEAT Founder and current CEO, will move into the role of President. In this role, Dr. Vajdic will focus on further innovating on the groundbreaking BEAT vector-based technology, driving research and development efforts, and advancing artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n“HeartBeam is at an important inflection point and the transition comes at the right time where we can best leverage the unique strengths of each leader. Branislav’s commitment to innovation and vision of providing unprecedented cardiac insights has enabled the Company to reach this pivotal point and we will continue to benefit from his drive to unlock the transformative opportunities ahead. Likewise, Rob has spent his career growing companies with innovative technologies, based on his keen understanding of sales, strategic marketing and go-to-market strategies, while maximizing value for stakeholders, and I am confident that his deep experience will ensure the Company is well positioned for success,” said Rich Ferrari, Executive Chairman, Board of Directors for BEAT.\nThe BEAT core vector-based technology captures the heart’s electrical signals from three dimensions to provide total heart intelligence. The first application of the BEAT technology is a cable-free, credit card-sized device that is designed to be capable of synthesizing a 12-lead ECG. The BEAT system is currently under review with the FDA.\nWith over 30 years of experience, Mr. Eno, age 57, is a passionate leader who has created go-to-market strategies for multiple breakthrough products including noninvasive FFRCT for diagnosing coronary artery disease, laser cataract surgery, scanning retinal laser photocoagulation, and intravascular brachytherapy. Before joining BEAT, Mr. Eno was Chief Executive Officer of Preview Medical, a diagnostic equipment company creating a new category of real-time, in vivo tissue classification for solid tumor cancers, using machine learning and proprietary optical signals. Previously, he was Senior Vice President of Marketing for HeartFlow, leading all aspects of the marketing and product functions for a new category of personalized, noninvasive testing for heart disease, including its initial product, HeartFlow FFRCT. He has also held senior marketing and sales leadership roles at OptiMedica, NeoGuide Systems and Avantec Vascular. Mr. Eno holds an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a BA, with Honors and Distinction, from Stanford University, where he was Phi Beta Kappa.\nDr. Lance Myers Appointed as Chief AI Scientist\nOn September 24th BEAT announced the appointment of Lance Myers, PhD, a pioneer in digital health data analytics and body-worn biosensor technologies, as Chief Artificial Intelligence (AI) Scientist. In this newly created position, Dr. Myers will play a pivotal role in guiding how AI is applied to the Company’s core technology.\nMost recently, Dr. Myers served as AI Advisor to BEAT. Previously, he was the Head of Cardiovascular Devices at Verily Life Sciences (formerly Google Life Sciences), where he led a team developing a novel heart failure monitoring solution. Prior to that, he was the Head of Data Science at Verily and built a high-performance AI organization with teams in computational biology, medical device and biosensor algorithms, digital biomarkers, health informatics and digital pathology. He has also held leadership roles at XAI.health, Sentrian, VivoSense, Boston Neurosciences and Vivometrics. He currently serves as a board member for VivoSense and is on the scientific advisory boards of Acorai, XAI.health and Bryte. Dr. Myers received his PhD in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Cape Town in South Africa.\n“Being appointed as Chief AI Scientist is both an honor and an exciting challenge. The HeartBeam technology, when combined with advanced AI, has tremendous potential to unlock and deliver groundbreaking cardiac management solutions spanning diagnostics, screening, predictive analytics and closed-loop patient management – where detection, intervention and real-time measurement continually refine and optimize treatment outcomes. By leveraging longitudinal trends and increasing user data, we can uncover new insights, pushing the boundaries of AI in cardiac care and bringing transformative advancements to patients,” commented Dr. Myers.\nFor more information on $BEAT visit: www.HeartBeam.com\nDisclaimer and Disclosure: www.aibrandnetwork.com\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: HeartBeam, Inc.\nContact Person: Timothy Cruickshank\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: 408-899-4443\nAddress: 2118 Walsh Avenue Suite 210\nCity: Santa Clara\nState: CA 95050\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: www.HeartBeam.com",
