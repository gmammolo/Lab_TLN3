  "text": "The leading provider of digital asset infrastructure, Ripple and International Rescue Committee (IRC), one of the world’s most trusted humanitarian organizations helping people affected by crises to survive, recover and rebuild their lives, announced a partnership. Together, Ripple and the IRC will explore how Ripple’s cross-border payments solution and pending RLUSD stablecoin can be used in the delivery of humanitarian aid.\nRipple has pledged a $1 million multi-year commitment to help the IRC. This funding underscores their joint exploration of blockchain technology , including Ripple’s global payments network and open-sourced solutions built on XRP Ledger, in two key areas: cash relief programs and cross-border fund transfers. Ripple’s established leadership in compliant blockchain payments, combined with the IRC’s expertise in delivering impactful humanitarian aid across 40+ countries, including over $70M in cash and voucher relief, creates a powerful partnership with the potential to transform aid delivery at scale.\n“Partnering with the International Rescue Committee marks an important milestone in Ripple’s mission to leverage blockchain technology for positive global impact,” said Eric van Miltenburg, SVP of Strategic Initiatives at Ripple . “We look forward to learning from the IRC’s deep experience in delivering aid on the ground, which will help Ripple support humanitarian efforts at scale. By combining our full suite of payments solutions with the IRC’s expertise, we aim to help vulnerable communities access critical resources quickly, securely, and at scale.”\n“The IRC is committed to exploring innovative solutions that help us respond rapidly to communities impacted by humanitarian crises,” said David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee . “We’re excited to partner with Ripple, a trusted leader in blockchain payments, to explore how their technology, like stablecoins, can enhance the speed and efficiency of cash-relief, particularly in regions with limited access to traditional banking infrastructure in times of crisis.”\nThrough its Ripple Impact program, Ripple has supported numerous humanitarian organizations in expanding financial inclusion. With the UN reporting 360 million people in need of aid amid growing global crises, this collaboration with the IRC furthers that commitment by aiming to explore Ripple’s blockchain-based solutions to enhance the speed, security, and accessibility of aid delivery.",
