  "text": "Apierion’s digital medical twin technology is now for pets Apierion, the Bermudian-based global healthcare fintech company, has expanded its digital medical twin technology to the veterinary field with a DMT for pets. The company said PetDT would provide veterinarians, pet owners and service dog handlers with secure, comprehensive and standardised healthcare data for their animals. By consolidating medical records, lab results, imaging and test data into one portable, permissioned platform on the Avalanche blockchain, PetDT simplifies healthcare for household pets and working animals, providing peace of mind and improved health outcomes. Apierion said it was collaborating with leaders in veterinary research and top specialists to bring the advantages of secure, interoperable medical records to pet healthcare. The company said: “Today’s landscape for veterinary care is fragmented, with records spread across disparate systems. The robust technology stack and high transaction speeds on Avalanche uniquely enable Apierion to offer scalable solutions for immutable and secure healthcare records. “PetDT aims to standardise these records, creating a universal platform and dashboard for all medical records, labs and test results that ensures timely interventions and a more holistic approach to care.” Michael Dershem, chief executive of Apierion, said: “PetDT represents a natural progression of Apierion’s mission to standardise and secure healthcare data. Just as we are transforming human healthcare, we’re now doing the same for pets and working animals, elevating the standard of care and offering peace of mind to pet owners and professionals alike.” Need to Know [How do I clear my cache and cookies?](https://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?answer=32050) 2.
