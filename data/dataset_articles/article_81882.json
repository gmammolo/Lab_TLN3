  "text": "Google Play has greatly improved the app installation process, allowing users to update and download an unlimited number of apps at once.\nHere's What We Know Previously, users could only update or download 3 apps at a time, but that restriction has now been lifted. The new feature has been spotted on the Pixel 9 Pro XL device with Google Play version 43.1.19, although it is not available to all users yet. This innovation is especially useful for those who are customising a new device or downloading many apps at the same time.\nWait... does the Play Store now allow installing a huge amount of updates simultaneously?\nI'm not talking about 3 or 4 apps, I mean like... all of them at once?\nPixel 9 Pro XL, Play Store version 43.1.19. pic.twitter.com/RWyvNm5vgc\n- Artem Russakovskii (@ArtemR) October 16, 2024\nIn addition, Google is also testing a feature to automatically open apps after they are installed. This feature, which will be disabled by default, will automatically open a new app 5 seconds after it is installed. The new Google Play features are expected to be available to more users soon.\nSource: @ArtemR\nGoogle Play Market",
