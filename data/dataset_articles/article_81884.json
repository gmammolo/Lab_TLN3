  "text": "Palo Alto, United States, 17th October 2024, Chainwire Palo Alto, United States, October 17th, 2024, Chainwire\nAkord, a web3 platform for securing and managing data, also begins its migration to Walrus Protocol\nMysten Labs, the web3 infrastructure company, today announced that following a successful Devnet, Walrus Protocol, a decentralized storage network, has launched its public Testnet.\nWalrus Protocol stores and delivers large data files, including rich media content, audio files, video, images, PDFs and more, from any web2 or web3-based source. These large files, known as blobs, are stored quickly and efficiently by Walrus, whose storage is resilient, scalable, programmable, and secure. Walrus's public Testnet, and its Testnet token, WAL, are served by Sui as the coordination layer. Sui provides a dedicated management architecture for Walrus to store its global state and metadata offering speedy consensus, composability, and the opportunity to integrate storage into smart contracts on Sui. Walrus's Testnet launch will include:\nAPI endpoints that support deletable blobs, meaning data can be deleted.\nDedicated Walrus explorer, allowing users to search data quickly and comprehensively, built by Stakestab Inc, maker of Suiscan & Blockberry API Platform.\nFull tokenomics ecosystem for the Walrus token, WAL, including epoch management, staking and unstaking, and rewards, as well as the WAL token faucet for developers.\nWAL staking app, developed by Mysten Labs.\n\"As blockchain projects aim to become more decentralized, it has been apparent for quite some time that a decentralized storage network was needed for networks of all kinds, L1s and L2s, to support end-user applications with rich media and larger storage needs,\" said George Danezis, Chief Scientist and Co-Founder at…\nChainwire",
