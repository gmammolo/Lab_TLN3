  "text": "Scharfsinn/Shutterstock Save for later Print Download Share India has high hopes for its emerging clean hydrogen sector, both as a means to decarbonize its own economy and for potential exports. The country’s vast potential for renewable power, particularly solar, has it well positioned to be a low-cost supplier of green hydrogen, made with electrolysis fueled by carbon-free electricity. Some see India as a potential rival to China, the current global cost leader. But India is not immune to the challenges and complications that have stalled green hydrogen development in most of the rest of the world. Despite big plans domestically and growing excitement internationally, India has a long road ahead before its hydrogen ambitions can become reality. India’s hydrogen sector is still in its infancy, but the government is targeting production of 5 million-7.5 million tons of hydrogen per year by 2030. Developers are moving slowly but showing early signs of progress. AM Green Ammonia, an affiliate of Hyderabad-based energy transition group Greenko, recently announced final investment decision for a 1 million ton/yr ammonia plant in Kakinada, due to start up in 2026. The company, which aims to produce 5 million tons/yr by 2030, says it has term sheets signed with European offtakers such as Uniper and Yara for green ammonia, a hydrogen derivative and key export medium for the fuel. Singapore-based Sembcorp has started front-end engineering on a 200,000 ton/yr green ammonia plant in the port city of Tuticorin, with preliminary agreements in place to export volumes to Japan. Large Indian firms such as refiner Reliance and conglomerate Essar have each announced multibillion-dollar investments in green hydrogen projects in India.",
