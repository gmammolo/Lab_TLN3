  "text": "Date: 27 Oct, 2024 Time: 4- 5 pm Speaker: Dr. Yaocai Bai Abstract: Recycling lithium-ion batteries is crucial for a sustainable battery ecosystem. However, the complex composition of these batteries makes material recovery challenging. This presentation explores solvent-based separation processes as a promising solution. By leveraging the unique properties of various solvents, these processes can efficiently separate electrode materials (cathode and anode) from metal foils. This not only reduces the risk of cross-contamination but also provides a concentrated feedstock for further processing. The presentation will discuss the application of these processes in both end-of-life batteries and manufacturing scraps, contributing to a more circular battery economy. Biography: Dr. Yaocai Bai is an R&D Staff Scientist within the Emerging and Solid-State Batteries Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Yaocai’s research focuses on accelerating the transition to sustainable energy through materials innovation and developing sustainable processes for lithium-ion battery recycling. Yaocai has extensive research experience in materials synthesis, energy conversion and storage, battery manufacturing and recycling, in which he has published over 60 peer-reviewed journal articles and holds nine patent applications with five granted. He is also the recipient of several awards including 2024 R&D 100 award, ECS Toyota Young Investigator Award (2023), UT-Battelle Outstanding Research Output team award (2023), and ORNL Supplemental Performance Award (2023). He received a B.S. degree in Materials Chemistry from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2010, an M.S. degree in Materials Science and Engineering from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), and a Ph.D. degree in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of California, Riverside (UCR) in 2017.
