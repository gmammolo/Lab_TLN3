  "text": "The Swiss Embassy in Albania, through an official post on its website, expressed gratitude to the Academy of Sciences of Albania for hosting the symposium dedicated to Eugène Pittard, the famous Swiss figure who made significant contributions to Albania. The embassy also noted the pleasant surprise of unveiling Pittard’s bust, which is owned by the Academy. The scientific symposium titled \"Eugène Pittard, the Swiss Who Did Much for Albania\" was held at the Academy of Sciences of Albania. It was warmly welcomed by Acad. Skënder Gjinushi, President of the Academy, and the Swiss Confederation’s Ambassador to Albania, Ms. Ruth Huber. In his speech, Acad. Gjinushi praised the albanologist, archaeologist, and ethnologist Pittard for his support of the Albanian people during the most challenging period of their history, at the beginning of the 20th century. This was a time when Albania, having declared its independence in 1912, had not yet gained international recognition and was threatened with partition following the First World War. Other distinguished figures, including Prof. Dr. Neritan Ceka, Swiss archaeologist Albert Hafner, and Acad. Shaban Sinani, also honored Pittard’s invaluable contributions to Albania. /a.c/",
