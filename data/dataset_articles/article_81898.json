  "text": "Apple has just launched a new feature on Apple Music that will delight artists and their fans. From now on, musicians can transform the setlist of their concerts into an official playlist on the streaming platform.\nRelive the concert or discover the upcoming tour With this tool integrated directly into Apple Music for Artists, artists can share the live experience with their audience. Whether to allow fans to relive the concert they attended, or to give a taste of the tracks played during the upcoming tour, these playlists offer a new way to interact with listeners.\nNot only will Apple Music subscribers be able to find these playlists directly on the artist page, but they will also be highlighted on Shazam, in the concert pages on the app, as well as in Spotlight search on iOS. A great opportunity for artists to promote their tour dates and showcase their world.\nAlready adopted by the biggest names If the functionality is now open to all artists, since last year Apple Music has already offered more than 450 playlists “set lists” from stars like Taylor Swift, Beyoncé and Post Malone.\nThere is no doubt that this new possibility of easily creating playlists as close as possible to the live experience will appeal to many artists, and delight music lovers looking for new ways to discover their favorite music. A clever initiative by Apple to stand out and offer exclusive content on its platform.\nSource",
