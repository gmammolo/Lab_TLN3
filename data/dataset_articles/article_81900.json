  "text": "Commonwealth Bank has been recognised in the top five banks globally for artificial intelligence (AI) maturity, moving up one place, and maintained #1 position in APAC in the 2024 Evident AI Index Update. The Evident AI Index is an independent benchmark for artificial intelligence (AI) adoption and performance in the financial services sector. The annual Index evaluates the ongoing AI development of 50 major banks in North America, Europe and APAC to track industry-wide AI adoption and readiness. Commonwealth Bank is one of only 13 banks to have improved its position across three or more of the four pillars of Talent, Innovation, Leadership and Transparency with significant improvements in both Talent and Innovation and ranked #2 globally for leadership.
