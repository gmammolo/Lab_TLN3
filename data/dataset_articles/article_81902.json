  "text": "In the largest update for Hades 2 since the Early Access launched, the Olympic Update adds a God-like amount of new content to the game, including big additions like [new Gods and new Boons](https://gamerant.com/hades-2-best-character-designs/) alongside smaller additions like the Crossroads Renovation system. The biggest addition to Hades 2, and the namesake of the update, is the new Olympus zone. [Related ](/hades-2-all-nocturnal-arms-weapons-tools-new-olympic-update-black-coat/) [ Hades 2: All Nocturnal Arms (Weapons) & Tools ](/hades-2-all-nocturnal-arms-weapons-tools-new-olympic-update-black-coat/) Take down Chronos with this complete list of weapons and tools in Hades 2. Olympus is the mythical home of the Gods atop Mount Olympus, and until the Olympic Update players were barred from entry after a certain point – but no longer. Follow this guide to get a basic [understanding of all the new content](https://gamerant.com/hades-2-all-patch-notes-updates-hotfixes/) you can expect to find in Olympus, and to find out how to get to Olympus in Hades 2 in the first place. Hades 2 Olympus Zone Overview Enemies, Locations, Special Features, & Bosses Though this overview is very spoiler-lite, if you don't want to be spoiled on the new Olympic Update content in Hades 2 at all, skip past this section to learn how to unlock Olympus and discover all of its new additions for yourself. The first thing you will notice in terms of new Olympus content upon entering this new zone is that there is a whole new enemy type: Automatons, which are charged with [defending Olympus from invaders like Chronos'](https://gamerant.com/hades-2-chronos-boss-guide/) armies. For some reason, the Automatons have turned on Melinoë, who must now battle past them on her way up Mount Olympus. In total, there are two new minibosses that you can find in Olympus, each kitted with a unique moveset from the rest of the game's bosses, requiring different strategies to defeat. At the end of the zone you will encounter a character that has been hinted at in other parts of Hades 2, now included as the final boss of the Olympus zone. [This terrifying Titan](https://gamerant.com/hades-2-titans-role-involvement-story-explained/) is a difficult fight if you aren't prepared for a boss mechanic that requires Melinoë to memorize patterns and avoid massive areas of effect. [Related ](/hades-2-weapon-aspects-nocturnal-arms-hidden-black-coat-nyx-selene-aspect/) Elsewhere in Olympus, you may encounter two new Allies that were hinted at in the Hades 2 Olympic Update trailer and patch notes. There are also two new Familiars that can be recruited to your side, though these aren't necessarily restricted to Olympus. These two new Familiars can be found elsewhere in [both the Underworld and the Surface](https://gamerant.com/hades-2-survive-surface-route-cure-curse-guide/). In terms of other major additions, there are of course two new Gods that you can find once you reach Olympus, both of whom are returning favorites from the first Hades. These two gods retain most of their Boons with slightly reworked mechanics, so they will feel familiar if you have any experience with the first game. How To Get To Olympus In Hades 2 To get to Olympus, you must take the Surface route when leaving the Crossroads, and progress through both the first zone Ephyrea and the second, the Rift of Thessaly. At the end of the Rift of Thessaly zone you will encounter Eris as a boss barring your way forth. Until the Olympic Update for Hades 2, Olympus was just out of reach beyond this boss fight. Though we could get just about to the ultimate end of the underground route, the surface route was locked off in the first few months of Early Access. Now, though, [once you defeat Eris](https://gamerant.com/hades-2-eris-boss-guide/) in Hades 2, you will be able to progress forth and unlock the Olympus zone. This is the third zone of the Surface route in Hades 2, and after beating its final boss you will once again be barred from continuing to the final area of the Surface route, which will likely be added in a future update in the Early Access. That is assuming that the surface will have four zones to mirror the Underworld route. It may well have more than four Zones (or unlock a final, final zone for completing both halves), giving players plenty to look forward to as the Early Access continues.
