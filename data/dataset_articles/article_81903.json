  "text": "A Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition is reportedly in development. The claim comes from [Insider Gaming](http://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition/)'s Tom Henderson, an industry veteran with a strong track record. Henderson has mentioned that the special edition’s content will be sold separately to those who already own [Hogwarts Legacy](https://gamerant.com/db/video-game/harry-potter-hogwarts-legacy/), which means that fans may have to shell out money just as they would for a typical expansion. It is believed there will be about \"10-15 hours of additional content\" in Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition. This includes a main quest and multiple side quests, along with new activities and cosmetics. However, no offical details are available about what fans may actually end up receiving with this [Hogwarts Legacy DLC](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-dlc-expansion-franchise-content-playerbase-potential/). As such, it's important to jot down a detailed wish list, drawing attention to what the base game missed and building excitement about what Avalanche Software could bring with Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition. [Related ](/hogwarts-legacy-2-scope-lore-harry-potter-changes/) [ Why the Scope of Hogwarts Legacy's Sequel is Likely to Be the Same ](/hogwarts-legacy-2-scope-lore-harry-potter-changes/) Hogwarts Legacy 2 could add a good bit to the lore established in the first game, but it will still be shackled to previous Harry Potter media. Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition Could Use More In-Depth Storytelling and Exploration Player Choice and Morality System [Hogwarts Legacy’s cut Morality system](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-no-morality-system-sebastian-sallow-slytherin-choices-dialogue-why/) is perhaps fans’ most demanded feature. At present, there’s nothing that the main protagonist can do that opens up branching story paths or even different, more interesting dialogues. It’s a running joke in the community that players can Avada Kedavra any enemy in front of anyone, even a professor, and be met with nothing but indifference. The presence of a Morality system in Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition will add replayability to the story by adding depth, as simply talking to NPCs could give a different result based upon the dialogue chosen, with Avalanche maybe even changing certain questlines or removing them altogether. Players could finally get to see something new during their replays and not the same flat response. This is naturally warranted as there should be a different reception when they’re as kind as [Hogwarts founder Helga Hufflepuff](https://gamerant.com/harry-potter-hogwarts-founders-explained/) or as evil as Lord Voldemort. House-specific dialogue options emphasizing each House's traits could also be interesting, though such a change would require quite an overhaul of the base game. Exploring New and Axed Locations Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition could bring back key missing areas, whether through main or side quests. [The Triwizard Tournament to visit Beauxbatons and Durmstrang](https://gamerant.com/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-hogwarts-legacy-2-beauxbatons-durmstrang-triwizard-tournament/), St. Mungo’s upon a character’s death, the Ministry of Magic, or even a livelier Diagon Alley are all intriguing options. One of the game’s strengths is that the Forbidden Forest and the Hogwarts castle are very well constructed and explorable. However, considering that there’s much more to the Wizarding World as a whole, seeing more than barren land and tiny homesteads is important. [Related ](/hogwarts-legacy-2-time-skip-future-original-protagonist-return-teacher/) [ Hogwarts Legacy 2 Skipping Forward Would Present a Magical Opportunity For The Original's Protagonist ](/hogwarts-legacy-2-time-skip-future-original-protagonist-return-teacher/) Hogwarts Legacy 2 hasn't been announced yet, but if it included a time skip, it could mean great things for the original game's protagonist. [Salazar Slytherin’s Chamber of Secrets](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-chamber-of-secrets-basilisk-squid/), for one, is an important location that actually has a precedent for being present in Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition. The base game has the infamous girls' bathroom that houses the entrance, and players can easily access it. A Gaunt descendant also plays a prominent role in the story, not to mention the massive and scary quest areas under the castle. Given these points, it would make sense for Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition to open up more areas for players to freely experience. The Missing Companion System In the time since the base game launched, players have encountered many instances that strongly suggest that [companions in Hogwarts Legacy](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-best-companions/) were once more deeply entrenched in the storyline. There are various NPC dialogue lines that imply the main protagonist would’ve had help during select quests, whether it be for narrative or combat support. Players being able to use chosen beasts as pets/companions on their journey is something that could have existed, and arguably still should. As of now, it is unknown why the features were apparently cut, but it's very likely that fans would welcome this feature in the Definitive Edition with open arms. [Hogwarts Legacy's combat mechanics](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-sequel-combat-focus-good-why/) and story beats can often feel repetitive, and they are both areas that could be improved by a complex Companion system. Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition's Potential Side Activities and Features Multiplayer and/or Co-op Mode One of the most talked about flaws in the base game is the absence of a multiplayer mode. Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition has the chance to allow friends to play with each other, whether it’s in the form of limited co-op for the story or simple multiplayer with dueling tournaments and Battle Arenas. [The Crossed Wands activity](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-how-to-win-crossed-wands/) has already shown how fun combat can be with a partner, so adding a simple multiplayer 1v1 mode could be a worthwhile addition. While Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition making the entirety of the story co-op would be a big ask, even having the feature for special scenarios or bosses, like [summons in Elden Ring](https://gamerant.com/elden-ring-boss-fights-made-for-summons/), would go a long way. This could even make way for a much harder level of difficulty, as the challenge could increase if another player joins the session, making the Wizarding World’s threats actually feel real. Types of Collectibles and Ways to Find Them Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition’s collectible system should be an upgrade over the base version, as a big complaint that many fans have had about the base game is how one can only discover a collectible item if it's very close by. As such, the most common method of collectible hunting is to cast the Revelio spell every few meters to find loot. This is naturally tedious and hampers the immersiveness that the game’s graphics and environment strive to deliver. Adding [buyable item maps from shops in Hogwarts Legacy](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-maps-shop-minecraft-trader-collectibles-good-why/) Definitive Edition may just be the way to go. [Related ](/hogwarts-legacy-sequel-release-theory-harry-potter-day/) [ Hogwarts Legacy 2 Already Has the Perfect Release Date ](/hogwarts-legacy-sequel-release-theory-harry-potter-day/) While the year of Hogwarts Legacy 2’s release may be under speculation, the date of the game’s release could be an Occam’s razor situation. Further, the variety of collectibles could be expanded upon as well. Field Guide Pages, House Tokens, Demiguise Statues, and the like may be good, but there are more options beyond these collectibles. Being able to gather nostalgic classics like [Chocolate Frog Cards](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-harry-potter-chocolate-frogs-wiggenweld-healing/) and Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans could be satisfying for longtime fans. There could also be lesser known but fun additions, like pages from the predecessors of \"Quidditch Through the Ages\" and \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\" Make The Room of Requirement More Useful The Room of Requirement is excellent, and easily one of the most interesting parts of the castle. Still, Hogwarts Legacy arguably didn't utilize it to its maximum potential, as there could be more to the [Room of Requirement](https://gamerant.com/harry-potter-room-of-requirement/) than a standard laboratory and interior decoration, with new features on the level of the vivarium being a great way to refresh the area. Perhaps there could be collectibles that players acquire to “realize” what more the special room can do. Through this addition, they could construct evolved structures that are used to create more spells and experiment with hybrid plants and potions. There could even be a minor questline where players learn basic wandlore and craft their own rudimentary wands or staves. If these actually boosted certain types of magic, like the [wand selection at Ollivander’s](https://gamerant.com/hogwarts-legacy-which-wand-choose-customize-how-core-dragon-heartstring-unicorn-hair-phoenix-feather/) states, players would be able to evolve their playstyles. This would be especially useful for multiplayer battles to create enough variety in spellcasting to keep things fresh. Since the protagonist can cast the Unforgivables and has access to devastating levels of Ancient Magic despite being a student, new spells and different forms of casting would not be out of the realm of possibility for the Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition.",
