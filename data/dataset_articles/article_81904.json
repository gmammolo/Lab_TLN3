This collaborative effort focuses on educational development, technological innovation and community engagement, says Joey Marchand, a CBDI assistant and partnership coordinator. Marchand worked with Aaron Krapes, UW Esports Club president, and EWC Esports Head Coach Caleb Spitzer. The initiative is designed to encourage esports club and team members to enhance academic offerings at both institutions while contributing to Wyoming’s economic diversification by cultivating a skilled workforce in high-tech fields, Marchand says. “This collaboration aims to create unprecedented opportunities for students in the realms of competitive gaming and emerging technologies,” Marchand says. He says students, educators and industry partners are invited to join the venture, which aims to involve more Wyoming community colleges and schools in the future. “This cooperative effort will allow us to continue to grow the esports community at UW and across the state of Wyoming,” Krapes says. “It will also give us the opportunity to assist other colleges and high schools in developing their esports programs, with the goal of stimulating academic engagement and, most importantly, enjoying the many benefits that competitive esports allow.” In a news release issued by EWC Esports, Spitzer expressed enthusiasm for the partnership's potential impact on the state. “Esports has the incredible potential to not only reach students who might otherwise miss out on traditional sports, but to equip students to take their experiences, merging teamwork and technology, back into Wyoming,” Spitzer says. He adds that as more schools and colleges include these programs, the benefits for the state as a whole grow exponentially. Steve Lupien, the Ada Lovelace Director of CBDI, says the center is sponsoring the UW esports club’s partnership. It represents a forward-thinking approach to education and technology, combining the competitive spirit of esports with the innovative potential of blockchain and digital technologies, he says. “It aims to position Wyoming as a hub for esports excellence and technological innovation, potentially attracting new talent and industries to the state,” Lupien says. “Esports has shown that it connects students to academic programs and careers in computer science, cybersecurity, AI, robotics and blockchain.” This initiative comes at a time when both esports and blockchain technologies are seeing rapid growth and increased interest from various sectors, he says. “By joining forces, these Wyoming institutions are positioning themselves at the forefront of these emerging fields,” Lupien says. UW will participate in the EWC Fortnite Invitational Saturday, Oct. 19, starting at noon in the EWC game room. The event is in partnership with the Wyoming Army National Guard and will include teams from other Wyoming community colleges and high schools. A 2017 UW graduate, 1st Lt. Garrett Stanfill, head of the Wyoming Guard esports program, helped arrange the competition. Sponsored by CBDI, the, the event can be viewed on the official EWC Twitch stream at [https://www.twitch.tv/ewcesports](https://www.twitch.tv/ewcesports).
