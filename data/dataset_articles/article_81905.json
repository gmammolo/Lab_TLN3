  "text": "Shares of technology companies rose as one semiconductor giant alleviated concerns about artificial-intelligence prospects.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Chief Executive C.C. Wei said revenue from AI-related servers and processors was expected to triple this year. TSMC's optimistic take on AI revenue prospects quelled concerns that had arisen from Dutch semiconductor-capital equipment maker ASML's earnings report.\n\"The chip makers are the guys in the gold rush selling the shovels,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief executive of IG Market North America and president of its brokerage tastytrade. The bigger question for the current earnings season will be whether companies who have made investments in AI are seeing any return on the investment, Kinahan said.\nMicrosoft affiliate OpenAI and buyout firm Bain & Co. are expanding their pact to sell OpenAI's tools, including generative AI software ChatGPT, to clients of the Boston-based consulting firm.\nLucid Group shares fell after the electric-vehicle manufacturer said it was planning a substantial public offering and projected wider-than-anticipated losses for the third quarter.\nPrabhakar Raghavan, the most senior Google executive overseeing its search engine and ads products, is leaving the role after a four-year tenure leading the company's core moneymaking business.\nWrite to Rob Curran at rob.curran@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n10-17-24 1729ET\nShare © Dow Jones - 2024",
