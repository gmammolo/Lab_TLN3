  "text": "Regarding the topic, the director of the company’s products and services department, Yuri Ilyin, said: “The engineers in our company are studying the possibility of using artificial intelligence technologies in satellites. These technologies can help the satellites choose the images they will take independently, meaning that the satellites, for example, will automatically reject images that contain On clouds or defects, these technologies will also enable the satellites to detect terrestrial objects independently as well, and this will speed up the process of obtaining data from the satellites.\nHe added: “These technologies will enable us to benefit from satellites better, as with them the user will not obtain a large amount of data that needs to be processed, but rather he will obtain answers to his questions and the information necessary for him, as the satellite will give him coordinates and information about a specific oil leak, for example.” Example… In general, the development and application of these technologies will help the Russian space industry take a big step forward, and will increase the value of remote sensing data for the Russian economy. “I think it is important to increase the number of Russian satellites for remote sensing of the Earth, which private companies are contributing to their development.”\nIlyin noted that LLM for artificial intelligence will help form a new approach in the field of space industries, with their help it is possible to obtain the necessary information without special skills in working with remote sensing data.\nSource: Vesti\n#Russian #company #plans #artificial #intelligence #satellites",
