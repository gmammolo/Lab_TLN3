  "text": "Veolia ‘s Push for Water Treatment Dominance: A Splashy Ambition! Well, folks, let’s dive straight into this fascinating tale of ambition, innovation, and, dare I say, sheer audacity! On the heels of its “New Solutions for Water” conference in Hungary, Veolia is looking to turn heads—and maybe even some water—by announcing its aggressive plans to capitalize on the bubbling market of water treatment technology.\nNow, let’s unpack this. The water treatment market is currently valued at around 220 billion euros and grows at a steady 2% to 3% per year. That’s like watching paint dry… but with more potential for getting your hands dirty—or wet—depending on how you look at it. Veolia, however, is not content with just floating along on this gentle current. No, no! The French multinational aims to grab a massive slice of the pie with growth expectations three times that of the market. We’re talking about a staggering 6% to 10% growth per year! Someone’s clearly been drinking their economic growth juice!”\nGreenUp, Greener Plans! In their “GreenUp” 2024-2027 plan—which sounds suspiciously like a trendy smartphone feature—Veolia has set its sights high. They’re aiming for annual revenue growth of 6% to 10%, which could be the equivalent of a teenager’s growth spurt—except instead of just getting taller, they’ll be expanding their global footprint.\nAnd let’s not forget EBITDA, which is essentially Veolia’s way of saying, “Hey! Look how much money we’re making before we deal with all those pesky expenses!” The group anticipates an average annual increase in EBITDA of around 10%—and if that doesn’t make investors giddy, I don’t know what will!\nA Future Tapped and Ready Now, if you thought you’ve heard it all, fasten your seatbelts! By 2023, Veolia expects a whopping 50% increase in turnover specifically from water treatment technologies. This isn’t just growth; this is growth on steroids! Estelle Brachlianoff, the general manager (and potentially the CEO of Promises), emphasized the necessity of meeting “the growing demand in key sectors of water technologies.” It’s not just about keeping the taps running—this is about quenching the insatiable thirst of industries while staying true to sustainable resource management. Quite the balancing act, wouldn’t you say?\nMicropollutants: The Tiny Trouble Makers And speaking of staying relevant, Veolia isn’t just stopping at water treatment. Oh no! They have plans to tackle micropollutants , those pesky little environmental ninjas that just refuse to be flushed away. By 2030, the company is eyeing a billion-euro turnover in this area. How do they plan to do that? They’ve launched a novel initiative called “BeyondPFAS” – a valiant attempt to combat these eternal pollutants. Ladies and gentlemen, if you thought your last detox was intense, wait until you hear about this!\nThe Bottom Line In conclusion, it seems that Veolia is gearing up for a future where water isn’t just wet, but an exciting avenue for profit and sustainability. With ambitious growth plans, a focus on micropollutant removal, and a cheeky touch of environmental friendliness, they’re proving that sometimes, the best way to tackle problems is to dive right in. So let’s raise our glasses— filled with pure, pollutant-free water, of course—to a flourishing future in water treatment technology ! Cheers!\n(AOF) – On the occasion of its Deep Dive “New Solutions for Water” conference in Hungary this Thursday, Veolia revealed its growth ambitions to capitalize on the expected development of the water treatment technology market. According to Veolia estimates, this market today represents around 220 billion euros, growing constantly by 2% to 3% per year. Veolia thus wants to take advantage of growth in this booming sector, and ensure growth 3 times greater than that of the market, of around 6% to 10% per year.\nAs part of its “GreenUp” 2024-2027 plan, the French multinational is targeting average annual growth in turnover of 6% to 10%. It also anticipates average annual growth in Ebitda of around 10% as well as growth in the Ebitda margin (excluding projects) of around more than 300 basis points.\nThe group also expects growth in ROCE (return on capital invested).\nBy 2023, Veolia expects a 50% increase in turnover in water treatment technologies.\n“It is crucial to be able to respond to the growing demand in key sectors of water technologies in order to strengthen the competitiveness of territories and industries and to meet the challenges of sustainable resource management,” declared Estelle Brachlianoff, director general manager of Veolia.\nFurthermore, Veolia is targeting a billion turnover by 2030 in the fight against micropollutants. The group announced the launch of a pioneering offer for the treatment of PFAS (eternal pollutants due to their persistence in the environment): “BeyondPFAS”.",
