It is likely that if England and New Zealand top their pools they will avoid each other until the final, though that is yet to be confirmed by World Rugby.\nShow Full Article\nEngland, who have won 50 of their last 51 matches, the 2021 World Cup final defeat by New Zealand being the only aberration, also have Samoa in their group, but will expect to advance comfortably.\n“It is going to be a tough pool, it’s going to pose us questions,” said veteran England forward Marlie Packer. “But I think that’s really good for us because we don’t want to get into the knockout stages not having being posed questions.\n“Australia have come on leaps and bounds and (former England scrumhalf and captain) Jo Yat obviously has a lot of English history, which kind of adds to the magic of the fixture.”\nNew Zealand will give the utmost respect to Ireland, who beat them in the WXV last month and shocked them in the group stage of the 2014 World Cup. Japan and Spain complete the pool.\nCanada, runners-up in 2014, will face Scotland, Wales and Fiji, while France, who have finished third seven times but never made a final, take on Italy, South Africa and tournament debutants Brazil.\nNew Zealand have been the dominant force since the first tournament in 1991, with England (twice) and the United States the only other nations to triumph.\nNew Zealand have won the last two finals against England, who have been runners-up six times but beat New Zealand twice recently.\nThe tournament will be held across eight venues from Aug. 22-Sept. 27 with the opening game at Sunderland’s Stadium of Light.\nSix locations will hold pool matches, including Brighton and Hove, Exeter, Salford, Northampton and York. Exeter and Bristol will stage the quarter-finals with the latter also hosting both semis.\nThe final at Twickenham, London on Sept. 27 is expected to be an 82,000 sellout, which would be the biggest crowd ever to watch a women’s international.\n(Reporting by Mitch Phillips, editing by Ed Osmond)\nDisclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.
