  "text": "Mr. Nick Horsley reports\nAMERICAN SALARS REVIEWING HIGHLY PROSPECTIVE QUEBEC LITHIUM PROPERTIES IN PROXIMITY TO RECENT DISCOVERIES\nAmerican Salars Lithium Inc. has started a strategic review of multiple Canadian mineral properties prospective for lithium in close proximity to recent pegmatite (hard-rock) lithium discoveries, including Q2 Metals Corp.'s Cisco lithium project and multiple projects owned by Sayona Mining Ltd., currently Canada's only lithium producer.\nThe first project currently under review has the Billy Diamond Highway running through the property and is located approximately 150 kilometres north of Matagami, a small town that contains the closest rail link to much of James Bay, and in close proximity to Q2's Cisco property that reported drill intercepts of 215.6 metres at 1.69 per cent lithium oxide, including 64.6 m at 2.29 per cent, on Oct. 2, 2024.\nAdditional projects in proximity to Sayona Mining Ltd. are being reviewed, and will be subject to further disclosure once due diligence is completed and a deal is completed.\nAmerican Salars intends to expand its portfolio of lithium brine projects to include highly prospective lithium pegmatite properties in mining-friendly Quebec. The company's existing portfolio of lithium deposits includes two National Instrument 43-101-compliant inferred mineral resource estimates (MRE) consisting of 457,000 tonnes lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) at the Candela 2 lithium brine project and a shared MRE at the Pocitos 1 lithium brine project consisting of 760,000 tonnes LCE. The Pocitos MRE is shared with neighbouring Pocitos 2, which is not under contract or owned by American Salars; however, it is important to note that none of the drilling that makes up a partial basis for the MRE took place on the Pocitos 2 block. Both brine projects are located in Salta province, Argentina.\nRecently, mining giant Rio Tinto made an additional investment into Argentina, with an all-cash transaction to acquire Argentina lithium producer Arcadium Lithium for $6.7-billion (U.S.), making Rio Tinto the world's third-largest lithium miner.\nAmerican Salars chief executive officer and director R. Nick Horsley states: \"Our primary objective remains the acquisition of low-cost lithium brine assets in Argentina, while expanding our existing NI 43-101 lithium brine resources. We believe that Quebec-based hard-rock lithium assets can now be acquired at deeply discounted prices and advanced with critical mineral flow-though financing incentives, in anticipation of the next lithium rally.\"\nManagement cautions that the company's intent to acquire property and current strategic review do not necessarily mean that a transaction will occur. American Salars's management further cautions that past results or discoveries on properties in proximity to American Salars may not necessarily be indicative of the presence of mineralization on the company's properties.\nAmerican Salars' global lithium portfolio consists of two advanced lithium resources in Argentina and its advancing U.S. lithium asset in Nevada.\nAbout Pocitos 1 lithium deposit\nWSP Australia completed an update of the NI 43-101 report initially written by Phillip Thomas, QP, in June, 2023, and estimated on an inferred basis using a block model with 6-per-cent and 14-per-cent porosity for the clay and sand lithologies, respectively, and a mineral resource estimate (MRE) of 760,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) on the combined Pocitos 1 (800 hectares) and neighbouring Pocitos 2 block (532 hectares). American Salars does not own the neighbouring Pocitos 2 ground, which comprises 40 per cent of the gross land package that makes up the resource; however, it is notable that all drilling to date has been completed on American Salars' Pocitos 1 block.\nThe Pocitos 1 project is located approximately 10 kilometres from the township of Pocitos, where there is gas, electricity and accommodation. Pocitos 1 is approximately 800 hectares (1,977 acres) and is accessible by road. Collective exploration since 2017 totals over $2.0-million (U.S.) in project development, including surface sampling, trenching, TEM (transmission electron microscopy) and MT (magnetotelluric) geophysics, and the drilling of three wells that returned outstanding brine flow results. Locations for immediate follow-up drilling have already been identified for upcoming exploration based on the most recent MT survey.\nLithium values of 169 parts per million from drill hole PCT22-03 packer test assayed from laboratory analysis conducted by Alex Stewart were recorded during the project's December, 2022, drill campaigns. A packer sampling system was used in HQ diamond drill holes that were drilled to a depth of up to 409 metres. The flow of brine was observed to continue for more than five hours with all holes exhibiting exceptional brine flow rates. An NI 43-101 updated report completed by WSP Australia has been released on the Pocitos 1 project.\nEkosolve Ltd., a DLE (direct lithium extraction) technology company, was able to produce 99.8-per-cent purity lithium carbonate, and extraction was above 94 per cent of the contained lithium in the brine (that is, 158.86 ppm of lithium would have been recovered from 169 ppm).\nAbout Candela II lithium deposit\nThe Candela II lithium deposit is on the southern and lowest end of the Incahuasi salar, located in the province of Salta, Argentina. Candela II is situated approximately 45 kilometres from the town of Tolar Grande, 267 kilometres from Salta, and close in proximity to advanced and renowned lithium salars, such as Arizaro (Lithium Chile) and Pocitos (Hanaq). Volcanoes Cerro Aracar, Medina and Pular contribute lithium to the Incahuasi salar through aquifers.\nQualified person\nPhillip Thomas, BSc (Geol), MBusM, FAusIMM, MAIG, MAIMVA (CMV), a qualified person as defined under NI 43-101 regulations, has reviewed the technical information that forms the basis for portions of this news release and has approved the disclosure herein. Mr. Thomas is a shareholder of American Salars Lithium shares.\nAbout American Salars Lithium Inc.\nAmerican Salars Lithium is an exploration company focused on exploring and developing high-value battery metals projects to meet the demands of the advancing electric vehicle market. The company's Pocitos 1 and the Candela II lithium salar projects in Argentina both feature an NI 43-101 inferred resource.\nWe seek Safe Harbor.\n© 2024 Canjex Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.",
