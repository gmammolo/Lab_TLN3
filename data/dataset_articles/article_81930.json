  "text": "Presented amusingly by YouTuber ‘Dunkey’ of videogamedunkey fame, Animal Well is making the move over to Xbox, and in even better news, it’s available today for you to pick up and play.\nAnimal Well was developed by Billy Basso and is published by Bigmode.\nIn Animal Well, you’ll “e xplore a dense, interconnected labyrinth, and unravel its many secrets. Collect items to manipulate your environment in surprising and meaningful ways. Encounter beautiful and unsettling creatures, as you attempt to survive what lurks in the dark. There is more than what you see. “\nIt’s a puzzle platformer that is very focused on delicate design and sneakily hidden secrets, that can take quite a while to unravel. If you’re looking to get stuck in, the game is meant to available on the Xbox store today, though as of writing we’re yet to be able to find a working link for it.\nWe’ll update this story when we do.\nThe game was a big hit when it came out, and it’s currently sitting at ‘overwhelmingly positive’ on Steam , with over 13,000 reviews, so it’s great to see such a unique and interesting title make it over to the Xbox platform.\nAre you excited to play Animal Well on Xbox? Let us know in our forums or in our community Discord !",
