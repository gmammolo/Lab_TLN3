  "text": "It Takes Two was one of my favourite games back in 2021, and probably one of the best co-op games of all time. Turns out a lot of folks agreed, as it won Game of the Year at the Keighly’s – I mean, The Game Awards.\nhttps://twitter.com/HazelightGames/status/1846588233573937193 Now, years later, the game has broken a new milestone, with over 20 Million copies sold, which is pretty incredible. Writing on X (Formely Twitter) Hazelight Studios shared the following message :\n“ It Takes Two HAS SOLD OVER 20 MILLION!!! You’re the best fans in the world, how you have embraced our game is blowing our minds! We’re so grateful to every one of the millions upon millions who have enjoyed their time with Cody and May. “\nIf you haven’t played it, you can check out our review here :\nHazelight Teases New IP The game was released in partnership with Electronic Arts and their EA Originals label, and it seems that partnership is about to bear new fruit, because now Hazelight are teasing a new IP .\nhttps://twitter.com/HazelightGames/status/1846929745016987890 There are plenty of clues in the image above, and it seems we’re definitely in for another co-operatively focused titles from Hazelight. Those hoping for a sequel, perhaps ‘It Takes Three’ look like they’re going to be left wanting.\nEither way, we can’t wait to see what Hazelight and EA Originals have in store for us.",
