  "text": "I would like to congratulate the leadership of the Tbilisi Scientific-Practical Center of Infectious Pathologies and AIDS, every doctor, nurse and staff member on their new building and moving to this facility. The Prime Minister of Georgia said this in his speech at the opening ceremony of the Tbilisi Scientific-Practical Center of Infectious Pathologies and AIDS, named after Tengiz Tsertsvadze. According to the Head of Government of Georgia, this is a new 11-story building that meets the highest standards, equipped with modern technology and devices, essential for successful and high-quality medical care. “The expansion of the clinic and having its own building will allow the medical center to conduct all necessary check-ups and tests on-site. An emergency outpatient department has also been added to the clinic. Most importantly, the health of patients, our citizens, will be cared for by highly qualified medical personnel. Currently, the clinic has 352 employees, including 86 doctors and 71 nurses. I want to express my profound gratitude to each of you for your immense contribution to our society. The clinic bears the name of an outstanding doctor, scientist and educator, the late Tengiz Tsertsvadze. He was directly involved in the planning and implementation of this building\"s construction, overseeing every detail with heart and soul. Today, his spirit rejoices as this building opens, where his friends, colleagues and the doctors he trained continue their professional work in this new facility. His contribution to our country is invaluable. Thanks to his innovative approaches and achievements, Georgia is now among the leaders in the treatment of infectious diseases, AIDS, viral hepatitis and other infectious pathologies. I am confident that the team of professionals, in these improved conditions, will continue to carry forward this legacy, further developing its rich experience and making a significant contribution to the health of our citizens in the future. Congratulations once again on the opening of this remarkable building”, - said Irakli Kobakhidze. Together with Mikheil Sarjveladze, Minister of Internally Displaced Persons from the Occupied Territories, Labor, Health, and Social Affairs and Tengiz Tsertsvadze’s wife, Ana Topuria, he unveiled a memorial plaque dedicated to Tengiz Tsertsvadze. Marina Ezugbaia, Executive Director of the Tbilisi Scientific-Practical Center of Infectious Pathologies and AIDS gave a tour of the new building to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Health and the invited guests.",
