  "text": "Samsung has developed the industry's first 24-gigabit GDDR7 DRAM 17 October 2024, 22:45:19 With its high capacity and powerful performance, the 24Gb GDDR7 will be widely utilized in various fields that require high-performance memory solutions, such as data centers and AI workstations, extending beyond the traditional applications of graphics DRAM in graphics cards, gaming consoles, and autonomous driving. In addition to the advanced process node, three-level Pulse-Amplitude Modulation (PAM3) signaling is used to help achieve the industry-leading speed for graphics DRAM of 40 gigabits-per-second (Gbps), a 25% improvement over the previous version. The GDDR7’s performance can be further enhanced to up to 42.5Gbps, depending on the usage environment. Power efficiency is also enhanced by applying technologies that were previously used in mobile products to graphics DRAM for the first time. By implementing methods like clock control management and dual VDD design, unnecessary power consumption can be significantly reduced, leading to an improvement of over 30% in power efficiency. To boost operational stability during high-speed operations, the 24Gb GDDR7 minimizes current leakage by using power gating design techniques. Validation for the 24Gb GDDR7 in next-generation AI computing systems from major GPU customers will begin this year, with plans for commercialization early next year.
