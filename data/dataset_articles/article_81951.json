  "text": "Elizabeth A. Brem, MD, discusses the shift she has seen in the community setting when it comes to using bispecific antibody therapy for patients with B-cell lymphoma. Elizabeth A. Brem, MD, an assistant clinical professor in the Division of Hematology/Oncology, School of Medicine at the University of California, Irvine, discusses the shift she has seen in the community setting when it comes to using bispecific antibody therapy for patients with B-cell lymphoma. In an interview after a Case-Based Roundtable event she moderated, Brem described how community oncologists are becoming more comfortable using bispecific antibodies for their patients. This change has been assisted by longer availability and the increase in approvals for these drugs in different disease settings, such as lung and skin cancer. While bispecific antibody therapies were initially used in academic centers, more community practices are adopting these treatments. Large community networks have been able to start using them in practice more quickly and this trend suggests there will be easier access to bispecific therapies in the community setting in the future, according to Brem. TRANSCRIPTION: 0:10 | One thing that has been really interesting over the last year or 2 is, I think our community partners are getting much more comfortable with bispecific antibodies. I think both as just they have been around longer, and as these things get more approvals and other diseases, right? So, we have multiple agents available lymphomas, multiple agents available in multiple myeloma, but even for many community providers, that is still going to be a very small part of their practice. 0:37 | But now, we are getting them in small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and so I think that as these types of drugs move into the solid tumor space, our community partners are just going to get more and more comfortable with them. Because I think early on, there was a big gap there with bispecifics, where you kind of still had to go to the academic center to get them. I think I am learning that really, over the last 6 months to a year, our community sites, especially the big community networks, are getting on board with them and getting comfortable with them very, very quickly. So, it seems like the access to those drugs is only going to be easier as time goes on.
