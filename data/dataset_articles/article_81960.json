  "text": "Axiom Space/Prada\nNASA has announced that its upcoming Artemis III spacesuits are being designed by a partnership between Axiom Space and Prada .\nYes, Prada, the fashion brand that has been outfitting Caitlin Clark ever since she became the first player to be dressed by them for the 2024 WNBA Draft .\nAxiom Space and Prada unveiled this week the flight design of what is being called the Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AxEMU) spacesuit that will be used for NASA’s forthcoming Artemis III mission to the moon at the International Astronautical Congress in Milan, Italy.\nAccording to a press release , “The AxEMU incorporates multiple redundant systems and an onboard diagnostic system to ensure safety for crewmembers. The suit also uses a regenerable carbon dioxide scrubbing system and a robust cooling technology to remove heat from the system.\n“It includes advanced coatings on the helmet and visor to enhance the astronauts’ view of their surroundings, as well as custom gloves made in-house featuring several advancements over the gloves used today.\n“The spacesuit architecture includes life support systems, pressure garments, avionics and other innovative systems to meet exploration needs and expand scientific opportunities.”\nThe AxEMU will also “withstand extreme temperatures at the lunar south pole and endure the coldest temperatures in the permanently shadowed regions for at least two hours. Astronauts will be able to perform spacewalks for at least eight hours.”\nAxiom Space/Prada\nSo… what does Prada have to do with all of this?\n“Going beyond our limits is one of the company’s values that perfectly reflects the spirit of the Prada brand and my parents’ vision,” said Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada Group Chief Marketing Officer and Head of Corporate Social Responsibility.\n“I’m very proud of the result we’re showing today, which is just the first step in a long-term collaboration with Axiom Space. We’ve shared our expertise on high-performance materials, features, and sewing techniques, and we learned a lot. I’m sure we’ll continue to explore new challenges, broaden our horizons, and build new scenarios together.”\nPlus, it looks really cool.\nAxiom Space/Prada",
