  "text": "The 2025 Corvette ZR1 reached a record-breaking 233 mph with GM President Mark Reuss behind the wheel, making it America’s fastest car. The 2025 [Chevrolet Corvette ZR1](https://www.motorious.com/articles/news/2025-chevrolet-corvette-zr1/) has officially become the fastest car ever built by an American auto manufacturer. At a recent test in Papenburg, Germany, GM President Mark Reuss took the wheel and drove the Corvette ZR1 to a blistering top speed of 233 mph. This record-breaking run on the High-Speed Oval Track at ATP Automotive Testing Papenburg solidifies the Corvette ZR1’s status as a true supercar, priced at a fraction of other vehicles in its performance class. This historic achievement comes on the heels of [Corvette’s](https://www.motorious.com/articles/news/jay-leno-gets-exclusive-first-look-at-zrl/) switch to mid-engine architecture in 2020, a move that unlocked new levels of power, performance, and balance. The ZR1’s incredible top speed is powered by the most potent V8 engine ever produced by an American automaker — the 5.5-liter twin-turbocharged LT7 DOHC flat-plane crank V8. This engine produces a staggering 1,064 horsepower and 828 lb-ft of torque, all while pushing the car to record-breaking speeds. \"Setting the top-speed record in the [Corvette ZR1](https://www.motorious.com/articles/all/jfk-auto-is-selling-the-last-c6-zr1-and-the-last-c7-zr1-convertible-made-as-a-pair/) is a true triumph for Corvette and Chevrolet,\" said Reuss. \"To go over there and get it done is a testament to the power of the ZR1 and the incredibly talented team that developed and built it.\" The ZR1 set this new speed benchmark with a standard chassis and aero package, featuring carbon fiber ground effects, Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires, and aluminum wheels. In Top Speed Mode, a setting developed by Chevrolet engineers for closed course use, the car’s chassis control systems were optimized for maximum speed. Notably, this wasn’t a one-off performance. Multiple runs were conducted with five engineers and two development cars, each surpassing 230 mph. Papenburg’s conditions proved perfect for this high-speed test, as Chevrolet engineers have previously set records there with the Corvette ZR1’s sixth and seventh generations. The 2025 Corvette ZR1 offers unprecedented power and precision for an American supercar, boasting a sub-10-second quarter-mile time and over 1,200 pounds of downforce at top speed. Its record-breaking 233 mph run is just the latest achievement in Corvette’s storied legacy.",
