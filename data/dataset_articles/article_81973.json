Diagnostic Developments: XR's Growing Role in Healthcare | NEWS | It has now become evident that Extended Reality (XR) is established in the healthcare sector, particularly for training surgeons, educating about healthcare practices and anatomy, and training healthcare professionals in general. This ABI Insight does not aim to educate the reader about how XR is prominent in the healthcare setting at this point in the trendline, instead, light needs to be shed on patient care, and how XR is affecting patients, rather than the healthcare industry. PICO has been one of the top voices discussing the deployment of XR headsets, including for patient care. PICO has been focusing not only on the benefits of XR for healthcare professionals, but on dedicating XR headsets specifically for patients and what leads to optimal patient care. XR is being deployed in patient diagnostics for conditions such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), phobias, and concussions. Paired with technologies like eye tracking, XR helps clinicians detect subtle indicators that might be missed otherwise, offering more precise and early diagnoses. This combination of immersive environments and other technologies allows hospitals to provide more tailored care, improving both the accuracy of diagnoses and the overall patient experience. Timely diagnosis is a serious challenge, with the average total diagnosis time in Europe close to 5 years. Simply put, patient diagnoses are often either delayed, incorrect, or missed altogether. Ripple Effect | IMPACT | Pain management is one area where XR’s impact is particularly visible. By immersing patients in virtual environments, XR offers a distraction from pain, which research shows can significantly reduce discomfort. In fact, research shows a 93% reduction in anesthesia use when XR is employed. Moreover, 80% to 90% of patients who experience XR in pain management say they would opt to use it again. Thousands of XR devices, such as those from HypnoVR and SyncVR, are already deployed across Europe, helping patients manage both chronic and acute pain. This has led to XR becoming a viable, non-invasive alternative to traditional pain relief methods, with a wide-ranging impact on patient satisfaction and hospital resources. In physical rehabilitation, XR has proven to be just as transformative. Players like PICO and Corpus VR are integrating immersive experiences into rehab programs, creating game-like environments that encourage movement and exercise. This allows patients who may be limited by pain or injury to perform exercises they might otherwise avoid. Additionally, with wrist-based tracking technology, these devices can measure movement and provide real-time feedback, giving doctors quantifiable data on the patient’s progress. This fusion of fun and function motivates patients to engage in their recovery process, accelerating rehabilitation and improving outcomes. Beyond pain management and rehab, XR is starting to be prescribed as a therapeutic tool in mental healthcare, particularly in countries like Germany where doctors can prescribe 20-minute XR sessions for therapeutic purposes. These sessions, often monitored by healthcare systems, are showing positive results in reducing stress and anxiety, offering a new, non-invasive avenue for patient care. The combination of XR and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is another exciting frontier, where AI can analyze patient data to suggest personalized treatments while XR immerses patients in tailored therapeutic environments. This could be especially impactful in therapy for phobias, PTSD, and other mental health conditions. Perhaps one of the most important impacts of XR on hospitals is its ability to scale patient care, while maintaining privacy and security. PICO, for example, offers dedicated healthcare headsets that work offline to ensure patient data are protected. These headsets are designed specifically for healthcare environments, ensuring that privacy standards are upheld, while delivering cutting-edge treatment. From Vision to Practice | RECOMMENDATIONS | To fully harness the potential of XR in healthcare, hospitals and clinics should focus on strategic, patient-centered adoption. By focusing on these areas, hospitals can ensure they are maximizing the benefits of XR while addressing patient needs and improving overall care quality. The adoption of XR in hospitals is growing because the technology works—for both the patient and the institution. It enhances diagnostics, provides non-invasive treatment options, and makes physical and mental rehabilitation more engaging and effective. The overwhelmingly positive feedback from both hospitals and patients shows that XR is not only ready for mainstream healthcare, but is also improving the quality of care and patient outcomes at every step, including diagnostics. This transformative impact positions XR as a crucial tool in the future of healthcare and diagnostics, helping hospitals provide better care while optimizing their resources.",
