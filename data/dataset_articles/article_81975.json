Among them are new Macs, iPads, and even another new iPhone in early 2025. Here’s everything we expect Apple to unveil in the next six months:\nNew Macs are coming very soon Image source: José Adorno for BGR Apple is expected to unveil a few new Macs soon with the M4 chip. Here’s what we know:\nMacBook Pro: Apple should unveil a new generation of MacBook Pro models in the coming weeks. This product should get the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max options with at least 16GB of RAM. Some people have already gotten their hands on this product ahead of time.\nMac mini: With a redesign looking similar to an Apple TV, the M4 Mac mini should also come with an M4 Pro variant. The cheapest Mac should also get more USB-C ports, and it’s expected to be released alongside the M4 Macs.\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

It’s unclear if Apple will revamp the colors or add any other hardware changes besides the new chip.\nUSB-C accessories: We also expect Apple to upgrade the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad to USB-C. We expected to get this upgrade last year, but Cupertino could make this change now with a new iMac.\nThese Apple products could launch early next year Image source: Apple Inc. For early next year, Apple is expected to unveil even more products, which include:\niPhone SE 4: With an iPhone 14-like design, the new iPhone SE could feature Apple’s custom modem, the A18 chip, and a single main camera. This device is expected to launch in the spring.\niPad 11: With the iPhone SE 4, Apple should unveil the new base-model iPad. This fairly minor upgrade is expected to be released early next year, as Cupertino just upgraded the iPad mini and its high-end tablets.\nAirTag 2: Years after the first AirTag, Apple is expected to upgrade this item tracker . It’s unclear if it could be unveiled with new form factors. However, an improved chip and louder speakers are expected to land with this new generation.\nNew smart home product: Apple is expected to launch an Amazon Echo-like device. Some analysts say it could debut as soon as early next year . This device should pave the way to a more expensive home hub expected to be released in 2026.\nDon’t Miss : When will Apple release new M4 Macs?
