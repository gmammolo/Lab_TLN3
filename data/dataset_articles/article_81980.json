  "text": "Evereden’s new Clear Skin Teen Collection, a three-piece set, is based on feedback from parents of[ Gen Alpha ](https://www.gcimagazine.com/brands-products/sun-care/news/22893807/sunly-sun-care-built-for-generation-alpha-gen-z-and-millennials)kids and designed to address the unique[ skin care](https://www.gcimagazine.com/brands-products/skin-care/news/22866038/prose-expands-into-skin-care) challenges faced by teens. While marketing to teens is nothing new for Evereden, the brand recognized a growing demand for skin care solutions as this generation reaches important milestones in their adolescence. Since its launch in 2019, [Evereden ](https://www.ever-eden.com/collections/teens-skin-hair-care)has developed products for moms, babies and kids. Starting with skin care in 2021, the brand later expanded its production to include hair care in 2022 and playful makeup in 2023. This year, Evereden has seen a remarkable 100% revenue growth in these new categories. “We were thinking about Gen Alpha in a thoughtful, segmented way, the way a lot of adult beauty brands treat their consumers, by making sure our products were not just developed and designed for Gen Alpha, but really tested by them,” says Kimberley Ho, founder and CEO, adding, “The fact that we’ve just launched it a week ago and the bundle is already a top three SKU in the U.S. really speaks to Evereden’s ability to grow with our customer.” The Clear Skin Teen Collection includes a three-step clearing collection: a balancing cleanser, toner pads and a gel-cream moisturizer. The line was designed from Evereden just for teens ages 12 years and up. Despite the campaign mainly targeting young girls, Ho says, “We’re finding that teens, both girls and boys, are responding to the collection. I think this generation, they don’t associate as much with colors, so that’s been really freeing from a design perspective.” According to market research firm[ NielsenIQ](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/), Gen Alpha members make up about 26% of American households, but are driving 49% of growth within the skin care category. The research data from NielsenIQ also shows that brands like Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe have benefitted from Gen Alpha’s interest in skin care. Ho notes that, “A lot of the growth we’re seeing in the industry is coming from Gen Alpha. I’m not really sure what the reason is behind the flattening of other age demographics, but what we’re seeing at Evereden is a tremendous excitement to learn about skin care and to use products that are made for them. We have Gen Alpha consumers asking their millennial parents to buy Evereden—maybe the parent has heard of Evereden, maybe not. We have to speak to both the parent as well as the kid and now this changing teen.” According to the brand, Evereden has increased its TikTok following more than 550% to almost 104,000 in the past six months. In the past 60 days, it’s achieved a 6.5% engagement rate on the platform, which according to Ho is above the industry average. Ho also shared that she uses trending songs and sounds on the brands TikTok to explain how to apply its skin care products and educate young consumers on ingredients. “As we grow this teen consumer, we will be able to segment the messaging in a more clear way,” says Ho. “Someone who has only purchased a teen product will only get messages and information around things that teens care about, products or otherwise.” Ho adds, “As a result of our success in cross-pollinating product categories and selling to everyone in the family, we are profitable and have maintained tremendously low CACs, which have continued to decline from years ago…Our customer lifetime value is also above industry average due to high retention rates and our unique brand ability to speak to different people in the family.” Evereden’s Clear Skin Teen Collection is available at Sephora stores internationally and Amazon.",
