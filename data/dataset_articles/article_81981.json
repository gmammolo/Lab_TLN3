  "text": "According to the latest information, Blania, the founder of Worldcoin (WLD), formerly known as World, did not rule out the possibility of the altcoin being integrated into ChatGPT one day.\nWorldcoin, the cryptocurrency startup founded by Sam Altman, has announced a major rebranding, now referred to simply as “World.” The company, which focuses on “proving identity” through biometric verification by scanning people’s irises, made the announcement today at a live event in San Francisco, where it introduced the next generation of its iris-scanning device, known as the “Orb,” as well as other new tools.\nIn announcing the name change, co-founder and CEO Alex Blania suggested that the startup had expanded beyond its original cryptocurrency focus. “The old name just doesn’t work anymore,” he said, hinting that World aims to expand its identity and mission. While the eye-scanning technology was initially intended to distribute Worldcoins, Blania explained that this plan was never implemented.\nAt a press conference, Blania noted that while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is heavily involved with World, the two companies remain independent entities with different missions. “He’s one of our co-founders and has been since the beginning. We talk a few times a week. He’s involved in all the decisions,” he said.\nBlania did not rule out integrating World’s cryptocurrency into ChatGPT in the future, but noted that their goals remain separate for now. “Of course, he’s focused on OpenAI. How much does World’s success tie into OpenAI? I don’t think so at all. These are two very separate missions, and I think AI is going where it’s going. What we’re building here is very important infrastructure for the world, and that’s not going to change,” he said.\n*This is not investment advice.",
