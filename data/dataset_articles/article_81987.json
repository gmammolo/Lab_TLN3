  "text": "[Presperse](https://www.gcimagazine.com/brands-products/news/news/22485060/fragrance-creators-association-20650-presperse-corporation-joins-fragrance-creators-association)'s new BioSyn Bisabolol is derived from 100% biobased carbon via a sustainable fermentation process and reportedly comprises the highest purity bisabolol currently available as well as high levels of the biologically active isomer (-)-α-bisabolol. The ingredient reportedly reduces redness, itching and irritation, making the technology appropriate for sensitive skin, and offers antioxidant benefits to protect the skin from environmental stressors and premature aging. The BioSyn Bisabolol also boosts skin brightness and reduces melanin content to diminish the appearance of dark spots and even out skin tone. The ingredient is therefore appropriate at levels of 0.1-1.0% for skin, body, scalp, sun, baby, intimate care and pet care products. Bisabolol is typically found in botanicals such as chamomile. However, Presperse's biotech process reportedly makes the production of bisabol more efficient and sustainable. “BioSyn Bisabolol is the future of sensitive skin care,\" says Daphne Benderly, Ph.D., director of research and Ddevelopment at Presperse. \"Its sustainable production and proven efficacy offer brands the opportunity to meet the growing consumer demand for conscious beauty products without compromising on performance.\"",
