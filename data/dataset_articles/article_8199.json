  "text": "Patient Care 14 Puppies Saved after CT Rollover Crash Involving Downed Electrical Wires “Not all patients are human,” the fire department wrote on Facebook. Tribune Content Agency 06.21.2024 Share Heather Morrisonmasslive.com(TNS) More than a dozen puppies were saved by a Connecticut fire department after there was a rollover crash involving downed electrical wires. Only one car was involved in the rollover in Woodstock, Conn., the Muddy Brook Fire Department said. Power to the downed lines had to be cut by Eversource before officials could rescue the people and 14 puppies in the car. “Not all patients are human,” the fire department wrote, sharing photos of the puppies, including firefighters getting “puppy snuggles.” Nobody was injured in the crash. Necogg Humane Society and Gwenn Gaumond from Peake Brook Veterinary Center helped with the dogs’ veterinary care after the crash. Some of the puppies had to be taken to Tufts Veterinary Field Service in Woodstock. “Sometimes people get frustrated and upset when I’m late for appointments or need to reschedule. I promise, it’s not because I went to the beach. I’m so honored to have the best staff that always show up when I need them,” the center wrote on Facebook. ©2024 Advance Local Media LLC.
