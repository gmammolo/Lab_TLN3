  "text": "[+](javascipt:void(0);)\nYouTube has rolled out a series of updates aimed at improving user experience, driven largely by feedback from its audience. According to GSM Arena, one of the key enhancements is the introduction of a finely adjustable playback speed feature. Users can now modify playback speed in more precise increments of 0.05, as opposed to the previous 0.25 increments. While the maximum speed remains 2x, this change offers a greater degree of control for users who prefer to fine-tune their viewing experience.\nAnother major update is the expansion of the sleep timer feature, which was previously available only to Premium subscribers, but is now accessible to all users. This feature allows viewers to set the playback to stop after intervals of 10, 15, 20, 30, or 45 minutes, or even one hour. Additionally, users can opt for playback to end once the current video finishes.\nMust Read: Samsung Galaxy Ring Debuts In India\nFor iOS users, YouTube is rolling out improvements for those browsing in landscape mode, expected to launch later this year. The in-app mini-player has also been revamped to become resizable and movable, providing easier navigation across the platform.\nOther notable updates include the ability for users to create collaborative playlists and customize video thumbnails using personal photos or generative AI tools, as reported by GSM Arena. YouTube is also introducing voting capabilities on videos within playlists later this year to foster greater community engagement.\nAdditionally, badges are being added to the YouTube and YouTube Music apps on mobile, recognizing achievements such as early channel membership or successfully completing quizzes.\nYouTube is also enhancing its television experience, introducing a more cinematic feel with visual upgrades like subtle pops of pink and other design elements aimed at adding dynamism to the platform. On smart TVs, videos will automatically play as teasers when users access a channel page, allowing viewers to preview creators’ content instantly.\nAlso Read: Google Unveils AI-Powered Partnerships in India’s Healthcare, Sustainability, and Agriculture Sectors",
