  "text": "Urwerk reinvents its iconic satellite hours complication with the most ambitious retrograde system it’s devised yet. As the hour hand reaches 60, the retrograde hand makes a 240° jump and the hour satellites rotate 270°. Despite its complexity, it’s one of the most compact models in Urwerk’s current range. Horological provocateurs Urwerk have drawn from myriad inspirations for their unconventional timepieces : 1950s sports cars, medieval knight’s armour, 2001: A Space Odyssey , the Lockheed SR-71 “Blackbird” spy plane… Some of their most avant-garde pieces, however, have drawn upon the natural world for their inspiration, such as the UR-103T Tarantula, UR-202 Hammerhead, UR-100 T-Rex or the UR-CC1 King Cobra – all named after dangerous animals. Urwerk revives this tradition in 2024 with the UR-150 Scorpion, which presents a new take on the brand’s signature satellite hours that does indeed evoke a scorpion’s lighting-fast sting.\n“We’ve once again chosen an evocative nickname for our creation and the scorpion is indeed a nasty beast – yet the design of the UR-150 is gentle,” Felix Baumgartner, Urwerk co-founder and master watchmaker explains. “It’s very Urwerk… the aggressive symbolism belies the reality of the watch’s cool, calm personality.” Indeed, despite its vicious name, the UR-150 Scorpion debuts a more organic, svelter design language for the brand. “It’s an evolutionary process,” says Urwerk’s other co-founder and creative director, Martin Frei. “We like to play with lines and enjoy juxtaposing gentle curves with acute angles. Here, the profile of the case and sapphire crystal is a section of the same shape – meaning perfectly spherical – while the hand shares exactly the same curve.”\nSo, what makes the UR-150 Scorpion so exciting? In short, not only does it feature a much bigger and more ambitious retrograde seconds arc – moving from the brand’s usual 120 degrees to a 240° arc – but it also features a more complex take on the brand’s satellite hours. As the minute/hour hand hits 60, the retrograde hand makes a 240° jump and the hour satellites simultaneously rotate 270°. Some scorpion strikes are as fast as 130cm/second – the UR-150 Scorpion’s retrograde action is similarly rapid.\nUrwerk has presented Satellite collection watches with retrograde minutes displays like this before, but none that travel across such a big arc. The fact the hour satellites also rotate (across an even bigger arc than the hand) really sets the UR-150 Scorpion apart from previous models, and provides an even greater sense of visual drama. It’s very fun.\nTo necessitate these dramatic rotations, Urwerk has ditched the typical Maltese cross mechanism (also called a “Geneva drive”) they use in basically all their Satellite models’ movements for a cam and rack system in order to handle the intense speed and inertia these displays generate as well as to maintain isochronism. Urwerk relates that the UR-150 Scorpion’s UR-50.01 movement boasts the heaviest weights they’ve ever utilised in one of their calibres and that it also features a speed regulator fitted to its flywheel – a mechanism usually employed to regulate the chiming sequence on a minute repeater – which smooths the return of the retrograde hand.\nAnother cool feature of the UR-150 Scorpion’s movement is that its automatic rotor features two turbines, which are designed to work as subtle brakes for the rotor, regulating its speed, as well as absorbing shocks. They also look pretty badass, making the UR-150 Scorpion a treat to behold from both the front and the back. Despite the power demands of its complication, the UR-50.01 has a 43-hour power reserve and beats at 4Hz.\nDespite the UR-150 Scorpion’s complexity, it actually represents one of the most compact models in Urwerk’s current range, with a diameter of just under 42.5mm. The curved design of its case, which hugs the wrist, also helps it wear smaller than it might appear. Perhaps the most interesting part of its case design is its crystal, which is extremely domed, with the case and crystal seamlessly extending from the curve of the bracelet along the same arc. Frei explains that as the satellites and hours hand share the same sloping profile, this lets you read the time without having to twist your wrist.\nTwo variants of the UR-150 Scorpion will be available at launch: a “Titan” model which has a sandblasted titanium and steel case – Urwerk’s signature look – as well as a “Dark” model which adds an anthracite PVD coating for a stealthier look. Both feature red and green highlights, with the Titan sporting a green-tipped hand and the Dark a red-tipped hand. Both also come mounted on integrated black rubber woven-effect straps, which resemble the armoured abdomen of a scorpion. Call it a sting in the tale.\nUrwerk UR-150 Scorpion pricing & availability The Urwerk UR-150 Scorpion is a limited edition of 100 pieces, split between 50 Titan models and 50 Dark models.
