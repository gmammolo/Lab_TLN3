  "text": "Manipal : Manipal Centre for Biotherapeutics Research (MCBR), MAHE, Manipal has entered into partnership agreement with Kore Additive Manufacturing and Medical Reconstruction Pvt. Ltd. (KoreAMMR), Mumbai to codevelop 3D printed biotherapeutic products. KoreAMMR has leased a portion of GMP compliant facility of MCBR to codevelop the novel 3D bioprinted products along with MCBR faculty and researchers. The partnership facility was inaugurated by Dr Narayan Sabhahit, Pro Vice Chancellor – Technology and Science, MAHE, Dr P Giridhar Kini, Registrar MAHE, Mr Ravindra Doshi, Managing Director KoreAMMR and Mr Chaitanya Doshi, CEO of KoreAMMR.\nWhile signing the agreement Dr Giridhar Kini, Registrar, MAHE, and Mr Ravindra Doshi, Managing Director of KoreAMMR, lauded the partnership to develop novel products and hoped to see the codeveloped products entering the commercial market soon. MCBR founding Head and MAHE COO Dr Raviraja N S said, “signing this agreement with KoreAMMR while MCBR is celebrating 3 year of establishment is a significant milestone, and this multifaceted partnership is aimed to develop new 3D bioprinted products for biomedical applications and to train human resource needed in this niche area”.\nMr Chaithanya Joshi, CEO, KoreAMMR said “the partnership with MCBR is a crucial for KoreAMMR and we will start manufacturing for clinical trials in this facility’’.\nDr Kirthanashri, Coordinator and Associate Professor of MCBR and Group leader in 3D bioprinting said “As part of this collaborative agreement KoreAMMR employees can enrol for PhD at MAHE and work under the supervision of faculty guides at MCBR. The master’s students of MCBR can intern at KoreAMMR to complete their dissertation”.\nKoreAMMR was founded in July 2022 with the mission to make affordable 3D Bioprinted transplantable organs and is incubated at SINE IIT Bombay and RIIDL KJ Somaiya in Mumbai. The founder was inspired by Dr Anthony Atala who in the year 2011 made the first 3D Bioprinted urinary bladder and transplanted it into the patient and the patient is alive and healthy today. The main challenge faced by KoreAMMR is the time it takes to clear the regulatory pathway to use 3D Bioprinted products for medical application. By collaborating with MCBR and MAHE, KoreAMMR is expecting to complete these clinical trials within 5-7 years significantly lowering the cost and time taken to develop 3D Bioprinted products and commercialize them. KoreAMMR is also working on developing organ on chip systems with MCBR to eliminate need for animal testing in exchange of human relevant organ models for pharmaceutical drug discovery and drug testing and for personalized medicine in the field of oncology. Through this collaboration KoreAMMR and MAHE will be able to train the next generation of biotechnology and biomedical scientists and engineers to make India a global leader in the Biotechnology and Biomedical domain.\nDr Harish Kumar, Director, Corporate Relations; Dr Arun Maiya, Dean, MCHP; Dr Srinivas Mutalik, Principal MCOPS; Dr Naveen Salins, Associate Dean, KMC Manipal and others were present during the occasion.",
