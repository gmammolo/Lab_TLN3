  "text": "Catching Shiny Pokémon in Pokémon GO is always an exciting challenge for players, and getting your hands on Shiny Meloetta adds an extra thrill since it’s a rare and Mythical Pokémon. However, Shiny Meloetta is not yet directly available to catch in Pokémon GO. Instead, players can still obtain Meloetta, and if they want to transfer it to other Pokémon games like Pokémon HOME, they will need to follow some specific steps. Here’s everything you need to know about Shiny Meloetta in Pokémon GO and how to potentially get it through other means.\nCredits – SportsIllustrated Meloetta in Pokémon GO Meloetta was first introduced in Pokémon GO during the Pokémon GO Fest 2021 event. Players who participated in the “Finding Your Voice” Special Research were able to encounter Meloetta in its Aria Forme. While this event gave players a chance to catch Meloetta, it was not available as a Shiny version. As of now, Niantic, the developer of Pokémon GO, has not released a Shiny Meloetta in the game itself.\nLike other Mythical Pokémon, Meloetta is considered to be a rare encounter, and whenever it has been available in events or research, the Shiny form has remained “Shiny-locked” – meaning it couldn’t appear as a Shiny variant.\nCurrent Methods for Getting Shiny Meloetta While catching Shiny Meloetta directly in Pokémon GO isn’t possible at the moment, there are still other ways to obtain this rare Pokémon in its Shiny form in the broader Pokémon ecosystem. The primary option is to complete specific challenges in Pokémon HOME, the cloud-based storage and transfer system for Pokémon.\nRecently, a new opportunity arose where Shiny Meloetta became obtainable as a reward for completing particular Pokédex challenges in Pokémon HOME. This includes finishing the following regional Pokédexes within the app:\nPaldea Region Pokédex (Scarlet and Violet): 400 Pokémon Kitakami Pokédex : 200 Pokémon Blueberry Academy Pokédex : 243 Pokémon Players need to transfer the required Pokémon into Pokémon HOME from their games to complete these Pokédex entries. Once all the required Pokédexes are filled, players can claim Shiny Meloetta as a Mystery Gift in the Pokémon HOME app.\nSteps to Obtain Shiny Meloetta through Pokémon HOME Transfer Pokémon: First, gather and transfer Pokémon from Scarlet and Violet or other compatible titles into Pokémon HOME. You will need to make sure you have one of each required species for all three regional Pokédexes. Complete the Pokédex Entries: Ensure you have filled out each entry for the Paldea, Kitakami, and Blueberry Academy Pokédexes within Pokémon HOME. Claim the Mystery Gift: Open Pokémon HOME, navigate to the Mystery Gift section, and claim Shiny Meloetta. Once you have Shiny Meloetta in Pokémon HOME, you can then transfer it to compatible games such as Scarlet and Violet. However, transferring it back into Pokémon GO is not yet possible since Shiny Meloetta is not allowed in the game at this point.\nShiny Hunting and Odds in Pokémon GO Although you can’t currently find Shiny Meloetta directly in Pokémon GO, players can participate in various events and strategies to hunt for other Shiny Pokémon. The base Shiny rate in Pokémon GO is approximately 1 in 512 for most wild Pokémon. Certain events, such as Community Days and Raid Days, often boost these odds significantly.\nCommunity Day Events: These feature specific Pokémon with a much higher Shiny rate of about 1 in 25. Raid Events: Legendary and Mythical Pokémon available in 5-Star Raids often have Shiny odds around 1 in 20, making them one of the best opportunities for Shiny hunters. Special Research Tasks: Some tasks during limited-time events may also provide boosted Shiny rates. Will Shiny Meloetta Ever Be Available in Pokémon GO? There is always a chance that Niantic will introduce Shiny Meloetta in the future, perhaps during a special event like a Pokémon GO Fest or a specific Mythical Pokémon-themed event. If this happens, expect the Shiny odds to be increased for event ticket holders or during a limited time frame, following a pattern similar to previous events.\nFor now, players who want to add Shiny Meloetta to their collection should focus on using Pokémon HOME as described above and keep an eye out for future announcements from Niantic regarding Mythical Pokémon events in Pokémon GO.",
