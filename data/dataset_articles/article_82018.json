  "text": "Nissan is set to enter the U.S. hybrid market with its first-ever plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), the Rogue compact SUV. The Japanese automaker confirmed that the Rogue PHEV will hit dealerships in 2025, marking a significant step toward expanding Nissan’s eco-friendly offerings. This introduction comes as part of the company’s broader strategy to electrify its lineup in the U.S., a market where Nissan has already been successful with electric vehicles like the Leaf.\nThe new Rogue PHEV will share its platform and components with the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, thanks to the automaker’s partnership with Mitsubishi and Renault through the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance. Mitsubishi’s Outlander PHEV has already been well-received, giving Nissan a solid foundation for its plug-in hybrid debut. The Outlander PHEV pairs a 2.4-liter gasoline engine with two electric motors, delivering a combined 248 horsepower—likely making the Rogue PHEV significantly more powerful than its current gasoline-only counterpart.\nA More Powerful Rogue The current gasoline-only Nissan Rogue features a 201-horsepower turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine. The new plug-in hybrid variant, with its increased power output of 248 horsepower, will offer enhanced performance while still prioritizing fuel efficiency. The dual electric motors will not only boost overall horsepower but will also enable a certain amount of electric-only driving.\nThe Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, which the Rogue PHEV is expected to closely resemble, offers 28 miles of electric driving range according to EPA ratings. In real-world highway testing, it achieved around 24 miles of all-electric range, which could serve as a benchmark for the upcoming Rogue PHEV. Nissan enthusiasts can anticipate similar capabilities in the new model, though official figures for the Rogue PHEV’s electric range are yet to be confirmed.\nNissan’s Broader Electrification Plan In addition to the 2025 Rogue PHEV, Nissan is also planning to introduce its innovative e-Power hybrid technology in the U.S. by 2026. The e-Power system, which is already available in several of Nissan’s global models, offers a different approach to hybrid driving. Unlike traditional hybrids, the e-Power setup uses a gasoline engine solely to generate electricity to charge the battery, while electric motors are responsible for driving the wheels. This setup can provide a more efficient driving experience, as it avoids relying on the gas engine for propulsion.\nAlthough Nissan has not yet confirmed which models will receive the e-Power technology, industry insiders speculate that the 2025 Murano, as well as the smaller Kicks and Rogue SUVs, could be early adopters. The e-Power system could provide a perfect solution for buyers seeking the benefits of electric driving without the need to plug in the vehicle, which would appeal to those still hesitant about fully electric vehicles.\nMoving Toward an Electric Future With Nissan now focusing on both plug-in hybrids and its e-Power hybrid system, the company is positioning itself as a stronger player in the growing hybrid and EV market. The Rogue PHEV will be the first of these efforts to arrive in 2025, followed by more models adopting hybrid technology in the following years. As competition intensifies in the hybrid SUV market, Nissan’s expanded lineup will provide more choices for eco-conscious drivers in the U.S.",
