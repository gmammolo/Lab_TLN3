  "text": "Rocket Software Debuts AI Functionality to Empower Enterprise Modernization and Efficiency Oct 17, 2024 By Sydney Blanchard Rocket Software, Inc., a global technology leader in modernization software, is announcing an expansion of its Hybrid Cloud solutions with generative AI (GenAI) capabilities engineered to streamline modernization. Aimed at enhancing organizational agility and decision making, Rocket Software’s latest updates serve to close the operational gap between enterprises and an AI-powered future.Central to Rocket Software’s Hybrid Cloud solutions’ new functionality is bringing scalable, cost effective GenAI and automation to organizations without sacrificing security and compliance. Rocket Software’s expansion reflects the company’s acknowledgement that AI and automation are the keys to true proprietary efficiency—and it’s here to stay.\"A number of industries are facing increasing pressure to prioritize decision making for operational performance and risk management,\" said Michael Curry, president of data modernization at Rocket Software. “The new and enhanced products in our Hybrid Cloud solution suite accelerate application understanding, streamline data integration, and enhance productivity. With over 34 years of experience, we have a unique vantage point from which we can help organizations unlock value from core business applications, while future-proofing operations.”This release introduces three new innovations: Rocket Content Smart Chat, Rocket Enterprise Suite, and Rocket Visual COBOL.Rocket Content Smart Chat is a secure, conversational AI interface that manages sensitive document access and querying as well as unstructured data classification. This is achieved while adhering to regulatory compliance, ensuring that sensitive data is protected under robust governance standards.With Rocket Enterprise Suite, users benefit from an AI natural language assistant that facilitates code analysis while accelerating mainframe application modernization and cloud transitions. As a key capability for modernization solutions across an assortment of major Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)—such as AWS, GCP, and Microsoft Azure—Rocket Enterprise Suite boosts developer productivity with simplified code and cloud migration.Finally, Rocket Visual COBOL offers an AI natural language assistant to advance the comprehension of COBOL code. By empowering developers to learn COBOL with ease, Rocket enables these personas to modernize distributed COBOL apps by integrating them with hybrid cloud infrastructures—without sacrificing core business logic.According to Peter Rutten, research vice president, performance intensive computing, IDC, \"Following the acquisition of AMC, Rocket Software is releasing new functionality in less than six months—an uncommon move in the industry where many mature software companies tend to slow down evolution after an acquisition. This rapid progression highlights Rocket's commitment to enhancing support for mainframe and distributed COBOL application modernization and re-platforming in alignment with hybrid cloud and migration strategies.\"To learn more about Rocket Software’s latest advancements, please visit https://www.rocketsoftware.com/.",
