  "text": "Can technology help employees avoid burnout at work? One in two retail workers across Australia has revealed that they are using artificial intelligence or automation in the workplace, according to a new report from UKG. The report, which polled 252 Australian respondents, found that 50% are using AI or automation at work. That’s ahead of New Zealand's 33% but behind Singapore's 92%. Automation is the biggest benefit from AI cited by Australian retail workers, as it improves inventory management (64%), scheduling (57%), as well as time, attendance, leave, and accruals (56%). Source: UKG Workforce Institute 2024 Industry Insights Report In the wake of these benefits from AI, 57% of Australians said they would like to use the technology if it meant improving day-to-day work . In fact, the respondents said they look forward to using AI for staff management processes, inventory management, scheduling, as well as customer sentiment analysis. Source: UKG Workforce Institute 2024 Industry Insights Report Using tech to ease challenges The widespread use and strong desire to use AI among the Australian workforce comes as a quarter of respondents admitted to somewhat feeling burnt out in their current role. Among the reasons they cited for burnout include: Being understaffed (77%)- Wanting a higher salary (63%) - Poor management (49%) UKG said that technology plays a \"critical role\" in avoiding burnout in the workplace. Citing the case of City Beach, UKG said the company ensured employees were not overwhelmed by implementing a system that helped streamline task assignments, enhanced communication, and offered real-time visibility into workloads. \"Mitigating burnout and effectively managing fatigue are vital in ensuring your workforce remains energetic and efficient,\" the report reads. \"By understanding how your employees are feeling and if they are feeling supported by management, you can assess and provide the right tools and processes to alleviate fatigue.\"",
