  "text": "LOS ANGELES—SceneLocker, a cloud storage and file transfer system for adult content creators, has launched a closed Beta test at its website, SceneLocker.com. With recently mandated proof-of-age requirements in several states, SceneLocker has been designed exclusively for adults who create video content and their content storage/sharing needs.\nSceneLocker is a personal storage vault with the ability to create quick single use links to share stored files between creators and collaborators in a safe and secure way.\nMatt Slayer, a content creator and host of the \"And Now We Drink\" podcast, said, “I was constantly being asked by creators about cloud storage and file sharing solutions, a number of whom had seen their Google Drive accounts terminated without warning. I realized that there was no company that catered specifically to the adult industry. Big Tech doesn’t want out business. Big Tech does not care about us. So, I assembled a team to bring to life my vision of a system designed specifically for content creators.”\nAdult star and SceneLocker spokesperson Cherie DeVille added, “Adult content creators have consistently faced significant discrimination in all aspects of our lives, whether it’s banking, getting loans, or even the ability to store our content on the cloud. SceneLocker will revolutionize our ability to safely and confidently store our valuable assets without the constant fear of being deleted.\n“Finally, a content storage solution where we don’t have to hide in the shadows, not knowing if we’ll wake up to tens of thousands of dollars of our valuable content deleted for simply existing,\" DeVille concluded.\nThe SceneLocker system is now ready for the beta-testing phase. “This is the point where we are ready for the input of creators, where they give it a spin on their own workflows, and we take their feedback. What sets us apart from other storage platforms is, we are interested in your suggestions. If you have a good idea, and it plays, we will implement it. In return, participating testers will receive 1 terabyte of free storage for the duration of the Beta and up to a 20 percent pricing discount at launch,” Slayer noted.\nFor more information, content creators can visit the SceneLocker website.
