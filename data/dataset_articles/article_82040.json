  "text": "Alan Wake and Control developer Remedy Entertainment have a bunch of projects in the works at the moment, such as a Max Payne 1 + 2 Remake , the sequel to Control , and some more DLC for Alan Wake 2, which we recently found out is launching next week on October 22 . That's a lot of stuff to have in development at once, but Remedy isn't finished there, as it's unveiled its first ever multiplayer game : FBC Firebreak.

No Thanks, Keep Reading FBC Firebreak was announced during Xbox's recent Partner Preview showcase, and was revealed to be a first-person co-op shooter that will see you take control of a group of first responders in the Federal Bureau of Control that are tasked with dealing with dangerous and rampant threats within The Oldest House. From the trailer, we can see that the tone for this title is more on the silly side of Remedy's recent releases, as it showcases a variety of weapons that players can use to fend off supernatural forces. These weapons include standard machine guns, as well as weapons that can fire shrapnel, green goo, and what appears to be exploding gnomes. FBC Firebreak Is Not A Sequel To Control In an Xbox Wire post accompanying FBC Firebreak's announcement, director Mike Kayatta makes it explicitly clear that the game is not a sequel to Control and nor is it DLC. Despite sharing similar environments and having a distinct Control vibe, Kayatta stresses that FBC Firebreak is more of \"a spin-off\" title, but will be just as robust and in-depth as Remedy's other titles. It’s not designed to be some kind of lesser, bite-sized Control. FBC: Firebreak is its own, fully formed thing. Communications director Thomas Puha also goes into what people can expect from this title, and Puha explains that the game will be \"easy to get into\" and will have players go on \"multiple hectic co-op missions\" that will showcase Remedy's creativity. Puha also explains that Remedy doesn't really consider FBC Firebreak a service game, but they do confirm that the game will be supported with more content post launch. We didn't get a proper release date for FBC Firebreak in the game's reveal trailer, apart from the fact that the title will be launching at some point in 2025. The only platforms mentioned in the trailer are Xbox and PC, though we can probably assume that Xbox has some kind of marketing embargo in place and that the title will be coming to PS5 too. [ Control ](/tag/control/) Control puts you in the shoes of Jesse Faden, the newly installed Director of the Federal Bureau of Control. You must explore the organization's headquarters, uncovering its mysteries and contending with a supernatural force named the Hiss.",
