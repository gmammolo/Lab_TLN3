  "text": "[<< All News](https://www.dot.nd.gov/news)Thursday, October 17, 2024 - 08:50 am BISMARCK, N.D. – The North Dakota Department of Transportation (NDDOT) has released a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) to strategically support the development of convenient, accessible, reliable, and equitable electric vehicle (EV) direct current fast chargers in up to 16 communities throughout the state. The NOFO will be used to distribute North Dakota’s approximately $1.2 million from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)'s Advanced Transportation and Congestion Management Technologies Deployment (ATCMTD) Program. This program is separate from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program which is focusing on EV charges located along I-94 and I-29 in North Dakota. “This funding opportunity helps North Dakota target investment in EV charging infrastructure in communities throughout our state,” said Russ Buchholz, NDDOT project manager. “Installing fast chargers in these communities will help reduce range anxiety for EV drivers, making North Dakota more accessible to both in-state EV drivers and out-of-state tourists.” The NOFO will focus on the acquisition, design, and construction of the EV charging infrastructure. Ownership of the infrastructure will remain private. ATCMTD program funds will pay for up to 50% of the project costs, however, costs for operations and maintenance are not eligible for reimbursement. EV charging infrastructure must be located in or near one of the 16 communities identified in the NOFO. Each community is eligible for one charging station with a minimum of 2 direct current fast charging (DCFC) chargers. An interactive map is available for reference (See map). Communities include: - Williston - Watford City - Stanley - Kenmare - Minot - Coleharbor - Bowman - Linton - Ellendale - Wahpeton - Grafton - Devils Lake - Petersburg - Carrington - Harvey - Rugby The NOFO is available on the NDDOT’s ATCMTD webpage at [www.dot.nd.gov/atcmtd](https://www.dot.nd.gov/advanced-transportation-and-congestion-management-technologies-deployment). Applications are due on December 16, 2024, with notice of awards given approximately 90 days later. Applicants can submit questions to NDDOT before November 14, 2024, which will be answered on a weekly basis and posted to the NDDOT’s ATCMTD webpage. More information about the NOFO can be found on NDDOT’s ATCMTD webpage: [www.dot.nd.gov/atcmtd](https://www.dot.nd.gov/advanced-transportation-and-congestion-management-technologies-deployment).
