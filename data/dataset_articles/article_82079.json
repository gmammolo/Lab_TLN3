  "text": "Crypto exchange Kraken has launched its own wrapped bitcoin (kBTC) token, available on both Ethereum and OP Mainnet.\nBacked 1:1 with bitcoin, the token will be fully custodied in Kraken Financial’s U.S. qualified custody solution with a publicly viewable reserve wallet for transparency.\nWrapped tokens like kBTC enable assets such as bitcoin to be used in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms for trading, lending, and borrowing. Kraken’s kBTC will join the growing trend of wrapped bitcoin tokens , following the recent launch of Coinbase’s Wrapped BTC (cbBTC).\nWhile there won’t be any supported spot markets for kBTC at launch, users will be able to redeem the token for the underlying bitcoin. The minimum deposit for kBTC is 0.00026 BTC (around $15). Kraken aims to drive DeFi adoption with this launch, partnering with major DeFi apps such as Paraswap, Yearn, and Curve.\nKraken’s global head of asset growth and management, Mark Greenberg, said: “We believe in an onchain future and DeFi represents a key part of that opportunity. kBTC relies on Kraken’s long history of seamless UX and top-of-the-range security, bringing DeFi to new users and accelerating the adoption of decentralized applications.”\nA California judge ruled last month that the SEC’s case against Kraken , alleging the exchange violated federal securities laws by failing to register as a broker, clearinghouse, or exchange, will proceed to trial. Similar rulings have been issued in SEC cases against other major crypto exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase.\nThe SEC filed its lawsuit against Kraken in November 2022 in the Northern District of California, seeking a permanent injunction to prevent further securities violations, as well as disgorgement of alleged “ill-gotten gains” and other civil penalties. The SEC identified 11 tokens—ADA, ALGO, ATOM, FIL, FLOW, ICP, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, OMG, and SOL—as unregistered securities.\nKraken argues that it was never required to register with the SEC, as it does not operate as an exchange, broker-dealer, or clearing agent within the definitions set forth in the Exchange Act.",
