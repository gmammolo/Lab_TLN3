  "text": "Key Takeaways - Remedy officially unveiled its previously announced Control multiplayer spin-off during the October 2024 Xbox Partner Preview event. - The game is called FBC: Firebreak, and is a three-player co-op experience that is targeting a 2025 release for the Xbox Series X/S and PC. - FBC: Firebreak will also be a day-one Xbox Game Pass release. Remedy Entertainment has officially revealed FBC: Firebreak, its long-awaited multiplayer game set in the Control universe, which is now confirmed as a day-one Xbox Game Pass release. The [Control](https://gamerant.com/tag/control/) spin-off was showcased during the latest Xbox Partner Preview event. The game itself was originally announced in June 2021 as Project/Codename Condor. Back then, Remedy merely said that Condor would be a [multiplayer Control spin-off](https://gamerant.com/control-multiplayer-game-condor-remedy-connected-universe-rcu/) published by 505 Games. The project's official name leaked via a trademark filing back in January 2024. [Related2:35 ](/control-2-update-september-2024/) [ Remedy Entertainment Gives Positive Update On Control 2 ](/control-2-update-september-2024/) Remedy Entertainment clarifies that production of its sequel to 2019's hit action game Control is unaffected by a change to one of its partners. Nine months later, FBC: Firebreak has now been officially revealed during the [October 17 Xbox Partner Preview event](https://gamerant.com/xbox-partner-preview-october-2024-date/). Its first 87-second trailer is entirely composed of in-engine footage, which suggests that the game will offer some immensely chaotic action. As revealed by the shooter's Xbox Store listing that has gone live along with the trailer itself, FBC: Firebreak will be a cooperative experience for two or three players. The game will release for the Xbox Series X/S and PC. FBC: Firebreak Won't Be 'Bite-Sized' Control, Remedy Says Players will be asked to step into the shoes of agents of the titular Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), and take on a variety of Hiss-infected enemies. The [lore behind Control's Hiss](https://gamerant.com/remedy-control-game-hiss-facts/) is fairly elaborate, and it's unclear how much of it FBC: Firebreak intends to explain, or perhaps even expand upon. But even though beating the first entry in the franchise will undoubtedly help players understand what's going on in the upcoming multiplayer game, director Mike Kayatta insists that FBC: Firebreak is not a sequel. He's even reluctant to call it a spin-off, [noting](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/fbc-firebreak-control-xbox-partner-preview/) that the project won't be a \"lesser, bite-sized\" version of Control but rather \"its own, fully formed thing.\" The FBC: Firebreak announcement trailer revealed that the game is now targeting a 2025 release. Since 2024 is almost up, this lack of a more specific release window suggests that the co-op shooter is likelier to release in the second half of next year rather than the first. Either way, its reveal trailer has confirmed that FBC: Firebreak will be a day-one addition to Xbox Game Pass. The Control spin-off will hence further bolster Microsoft's [growing 2025 lineup of Xbox Game Pass titles](https://gamerant.com/xbox-game-pass-games-2025/), which already includes the likes of Avowed, Doom: The Dark Ages, and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers. Based on the co-op shooter's first trailer, it would appear that Remedy managed to reuse many Control locations for FBC: Firebreak. Aside from its first-ever multiplayer game, the Finnish developer is also currently working on Control 2, having confirmed as much back in late 2022. Xbox Game Pass members are currently able to play Control: Ultimate Edition, which has returned to the subscription service back in March 2024.",
