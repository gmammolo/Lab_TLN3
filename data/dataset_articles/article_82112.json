  "text": "Maine Connectivity Authority launches ‘Working Internet ASAP’ program BANGOR, Maine (WABI) - There’s about 1.5% of Maine that still doesn’t have internet access technology. That’s according to the Senior Director of program operations at [Maine Connectivity Authority](https://www.maineconnectivity.org/). That’s why they’re launching the Working Internet ASAP program. It’s one of the last steps to provide reliable internet connection to hard-to-reach locations across Maine. “After we conducted our analysis, the locations are really spread across the state,” said Brian Allenby. “There are some concentrations around Aroostook, Penobscot, and Oxford counties. But really there are some locations in every county across the state and so our goal through this program is to make an internet connection available. The option for folks to subscribe.” They will have an enrollment portal open in November on [MCA’s website](https://www.maineconnectivity.org/). If Mainers are curious if their area will qualify, head to their website, review a map and enter information for details. Copyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",
