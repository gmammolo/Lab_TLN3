  "text": "TOKYO -- Some prefectural police forces in Japan will introduce body cameras in fiscal 2025 on a trial basis to verify that officers are carrying out their duties appropriately and to provide appropriate on-site command for crowd control, the National Police Agency (NPA) announced on Oct. 17. The NPA will review how well the system works to consider full-scale introduction of body cameras nationwide. The specific prefectural police forces that will conduct the trial will be decided in the future. A total of 39 cameras will be deployed for community police in three prefectures, 18 devices for traffic police in three prefectures, and 19 for security police in nine prefectures. The camera is about the size of a business card. It is envisioned that community and traffic officers will put the device on their chest, and security officers will wear it on their chest or head. Video and audio will be recorded. A red light on the camera will turn on and officers with the equipment will wear an armband to indicate to the other party that the camera is recording. The main purpose of issuing them for community and traffic policing is to verify whether questioning and targeted crackdowns are being conducted appropriately. In principle, the cameras will always be on when officers are outdoors on duty such as during a patrol. This includes activities in public places such as train stations. On the other hand, recording will be paused when the police are receiving sexual assault consultations or entering private homes. Recording for traffic policing will mainly last for the duration of a traffic stop for a violation. The footage may reportedly be shown to violators. In security, the recorded data will be sent to the headquarters in real time to facilitate appropriate on-site command decisions. The data will be stored for about three months for community and traffic policing, and about a week for security. It will be stored on a police station's computer and elsewhere, and will be deleted when the storage period expires. It is expected that the NPA will establish guidelines for the trial operation and that each prefectural police force will formulate its general direction, with the aim of starting the trial as early as April 2025.
