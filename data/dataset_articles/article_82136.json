  "text": "Want the latest hero ship? You'll have to gamble for it! [Star Trek Online](https://stevivor.com/tag/star-trek-online/) has added [Star Trek Prodigy‘s Lamarr-class](https://stevivor.com/tag/star-trek-prodigy/), best known for the U.S.S. Voyager-A, as a gambling-based lootbox ship. Those who want a chance to fly the franchise’s newest hero ship will have to pay for Infinity boxes (or rather, keys to open them), and hope that the Lamarr-class is then bestowed upon them. As per usual, and as per the same sentiments being expressed when other hero ships like [Picard‘s Constitution III-](https://stevivor.com/news/enterprise-g-only-obtainable-through-paid-chance-in-star-trek-online/) and [Duderstadt-classes went straight to lootboxes](https://stevivor.com/news/star-trek-online-adds-picards-duderstadt-class-as-lock-box/) — players aren’t thrilled. “ nd of course its infinity promotion ship,” wrote [one user](https://ufplanets.com/showthread.php?90508-Command-the-Lamarr-Class!). “God forbid Cryptic puts anything nice in the Cstore for a change.” “Hero Ship of a new Trek show,” replied another, “business as usual for them.” [Star Trek Online](https://stevivor.com/tag/star-trek-online/) is currently available on Windows PC, Xbox One, and PS4.
