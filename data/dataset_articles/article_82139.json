  "text": "about 1 hour ago • 1 min What’s going on here? The USDA has set a new record with its corn yield forecast at 183.8 bushels per acre for 2024, echoing the rising trends last seen in 2014. This surge in production emerges amid ongoing adjustments to corn [stocks](/glossary/stock) and market speculations. What does this mean? The USDA's upbeat yield prediction is reminiscent of 2014, when yields climbed monthly to set fresh records. Despite the higher yields, ending stocks for 2023-24 are at a four-year high, yet they still fell short of expectations due to underestimated demand. There's skepticism around the USDA's forecasted 14% increase in 2024-25 stocks, indicating a cautious stance. At the Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures mirrored a similar pattern of [volatility](/glossary/volatility) from a decade ago, falling more than 9% in June 2024 amid a robust harvest outlook, before slightly rebounding in September amid global crop concerns. The mood among speculators is also shifting, as 2024's bearish positions are now easing, with money managers turning less bearish than in previous months. Why should I care? For markets: Corn's turbulent ride to stability. Investors should consider the similarities between 2014 and now, as current conditions hint at potential price rallies, particularly if 2024-25 ending stocks dip below the important 2 billion bushel threshold. Market volatility is further swayed by evolving speculative positions, pointing to possible movements as we near the year's end. The bigger picture: A familiar forecasting challenge. Globally, the impact of US yield changes is significant. As the world observes the US's bumper crop year, subtle shifts in forecasts and stock levels can trigger ripples across international markets, affecting trade balances and global food security strategies.
