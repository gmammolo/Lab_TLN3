  "text": "Partnership is expected to develop radioligand therapies based on lead-212 alpha-emitting isotopes, which offer the opportunity to destroy cancer cells with minimal damage to healthy tissue. Sanofi and Orano Med announced that they have agreed to terms on co-developing radioligand therapies (RLTs) for rare cancers. According to Sanofi, the joint venture aims to revolutionize treatment options for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers. Operating under the Orano Med brand, the collaboration will also focus on the discovery, design, and clinical development of RLTs based on lead-212 alpha-emitting isotopes, which have the potential to destroy cancer cells with little damage to healthy tissue. This agreement follows news of an exclusive licensing agreement with Orano Med and RadioMedix to advance RLTs in rare cancers with a focus on one late-stage project, AlphaMedix.1 “We are excited to partner with Orano in establishing a French pioneer that unites our respective expertise in biopharma and nuclear technology to drive groundbreaking progress in the fight against cancer. As a French biopharmaceutical company, we are deeply committed to fostering and enabling innovation in our home country. This collaboration is part of a broader effort to strengthen our ties within the scientific community, both in France and globally, with the goal of advancing the development of cutting-edge treatments for patients,” said Paul Hudson, CEO, Sanofi, in a press release. Orano stated that the investment by Sanofi is expected to strengthen the company and allow them to accelerate the development of their pipeline, leveraging the unique capabilities in the discovery and development of lead-212 based therapies. Additionally, Orano Med has developed a global industrial platform with the goal of ensuring an independent, reliable, and scalable supply of lead-212 based therapies to patients globally. Under terms of the deal, Sanofi will make an investment of approximately $325 million, a 16% equity stake in the new entity.1 “Sanofi’s partnership with Orano Med is a strong recognition of the potential of lead-212 based radioligand therapies to advance the treatment of cancers. This validates our strategy, having developed this expertise over the past 15 years, and reinforces our position as a leader in targeted alpha therapies. We look forward to combining Sanofi’s expertise with our R&D and world-class radiopharmaceutical capabilities to advance the development of potentially transformative therapies like AlphaMedix and make them available to patients in need as quickly as possible,” said Julien Dodet, president, governing board, Orano Med, in the press release. RLTs work by employing molecules labeled with radioactive isotopes that specifically bind to cancer cells, delivering localized radiation directly to the tumor or metastatic sites. According to the Advanced Radiation Centers of New York, RLTs combine the specificity of molecular targeting agents with the therapeutic efficacy of radiation, offering a promising option for treating various cancer types. Common RLTs include Xofigo and Pluvicto for prostate cancer, and Zevalin for lymphomas. In most cases, patients who are candidates for RLTs are those with advanced or metastatic cancer that expresses specific targets for the radioligands, such as bone metastases in prostate cancer for Xofigo or prostate-specific membrane antigen-positive cells for Pluvicto.2 “The success of Orano Med is an example of our group's ability to diversify beyond our core nuclear business. By applying our expertise in nuclear materials to fields like targeted alpha therapies, we are demonstrating that nuclear technology can have a positive societal impact, not just for energy and climate, but also for human health. This innovation reflects Orano's commitment to exploring new opportunities and taking bold steps to address some of the world’s most pressing challenges,” said Nicholas Maes, CEO, Orange Group, in the press release.
