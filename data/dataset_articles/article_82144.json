  "text": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) may predict the treatment effect of finerenone on the risk for hospitalization for heart failure among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes, with a greater risk reduction observed in patients with baseline LVH, according to a recent study. The findings are from a post hoc analysis of 13,026 patients in [FIDELITY](https://www.renalandurologynews.com/reports/finerenone-beneficial-in-advanced-chronic-kidney-disease/), a prespecified pooled analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter FIDELIO-DKD ( [NCT02540993](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02540993)) and FIGARO-DKD ( [NCT02545049](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02545049)) phase 3 trials. For these trials, investigators randomly assigned patients with optimized renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor therapy to receive finerenone or placebo. Overall, the [finerenone](https://www.empr.com/drug/kerendia/) arm had a significant 22% decreased for hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) compared with the placebo arm, Gerasimos Filippatos, MD, of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in Greece, and colleagues reported in ESC Heart Failure. Patients with baseline LVH, however, had a significant 68% decreased risk, whereas those without baseline LVH had a nonsignificant 14% decreased risk. Compared with the placebo arm, the finerenone-treated patients had a significant 14% and 23% decreased risk for a composite cardiovascular (CV) outcome (time to CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or HHF) and [composite kidney outcome](https://www.renalandurologynews.com/reports/finerenone-may-not-slow-kidney-function-decline-in-patients-with-heart-failure/) (time to onset of kidney failure, a sustained decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate of 57% or greater from baseline over 4 or more weeks, or kidney-related death), respectively. The risk reductions did not differ significantly based on the presence or absence of LVH. Investigators found an increased incidence of treatment-related hyperkalemia with finerenone compared with placebo. The discontinuation rates in both groups were low, however. Overall safety findings were similar in the LVH subgroups. The authors noted that further investigation is warranted to assess how finerenone modifies CV risk in this patient population. It is unknown whether LVH is merely a marker of increased risk or an indicator of heightened mineralocorticoid receptor activation that is responsive specifically to agents in this class compared to other treatments. The investigators acknowledged that a limitation of the study was the lack of standardized LVH criteria for diagnosing LVH based on electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. “It is an intriguing finding and biologically plausible. Baseline LVH could be a modifier of the effects of finerenone on CV outcomes,” said nephrologist Srinivasan Beddhu, MD, a professor and Dialysis Research Foundation Presidential Endowed Chair in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. He added, “Identifying subgroups who are most likely to benefit from the newer, but expensive therapeutic agents might help to optimize the cost-benefit ratio.” Referring to the investigators’ use of ECG for diagnosing LVH, Catherine Clase, MD, professor of medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, observed: “This doesn’t introduce bias, but means that when we think about the study, we should think about it as stratified by LVH on ECG, not as stratified by LVH. We generally don’t base treatment decisions on the results of stratified or subgroup analyses anyway, but we do use them in hypothesis generation and to help understand mechanisms.” “Patients with CKD frequently have LVH. This is a critical issue as this leads to increased cardiovascular mortality. This study adds to the growing body of evidence that targeting LVH among high cardiovascular risk CKD patients is important,” said Deepak Chandramohan, MD, an assistant professor in the Division of Nephrology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Although the discontinuation rates due to hyperkalemia in the study were low, the study reinforces the importance of monitoring for the condition, according to Dr Chandramohan.
