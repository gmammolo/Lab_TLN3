  "text": "Thirty new “hyper-fast” chargers were unveiled Thursday, Oct. 17, at the Port of Long Beach by 4 Gen Logistics. The chargers are designed to quickly power the family-owned company’s growing fleet of 79 heavy-duty electric trucks serving the Port of Long Beach — and marks the largest charging facility in a North American port to date. The chargers, capable of speeds up to 350 kilowatts, were developed in collaboration with Electrify America. The company said in a release that the unveiling marks “a significant step in 4 Gen’s commitment to a fully zero-emission fleet by 2025, positioning it as the only North American company operating over 75 zero-emission trucks (ZEVs).” It also comes, the release said, “10 years ahead of California’s Air Resources Board (CARB) mandate requiring all drayage trucks to be zero-emission by 2035.” The chargers will support the growing 4 Gen fleet, which currently consists of 79 ZEVs, including Class 8 Volvo VNRs, Kenworth T680E BEVs and Nikola hydrogen fuel cell trucks. The infrastructure is part of a broader effort to reduce emissions in Southern California, especially around the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. The first phase includes chargers across Rialto and Long Beach. “With our partners,” 4 Gen Logistics CEO David Duncan said in a written comment, “we’re proving that zero-emission transportation is not just a future goal but a reality today.” The transition goals, however, have proved challenging as both the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach encounter technology development timelines and low commercial availability; and when equipment is commercially available, it still comes with high vehicle costs. The new hyper-fast chargers are designed to enable the fleet to run multiple daily shifts between the Inland Empire and the ports. Electrify America’s $25 million “Green City” investment, focused on electrification projects in Long Beach and Wilmington, supports the first phase of the project. Speakers at Thursday’s event included U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia, Long Beach Mayor Rex Richardson, and Long Beach harbor commission Vice President Frank Colonna.",
