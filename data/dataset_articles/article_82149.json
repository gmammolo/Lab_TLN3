These sample types provide a rich and diverse pool of infectious disease diagnostic information. They contain circulating DNA, RNA, proteins, and other biomarkers that carry valuable insights into various diseases and conditions. This wealth of information enables healthcare professionals to make accurate diagnoses, monitor disease progression, and personalize treatment decisions.\nNorth America is the largest regional market for infectious disease diagnostics market.\nThe market for infectious disease diagnostics has been divided into five key geographical regions: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. In 2022, North America held the predominant portion of the infectious disease diagnostics market. The infectious disease diagnostics market in North America is well-established, with the US being a major market in this region.
