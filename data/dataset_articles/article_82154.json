  "text": "XMAR announces the launch of its online bunker trading platform, transforming fuel purchasing by connecting users with 1,500 suppliers across 500 global ports.\nLIMASSOL, CYPRUS / ACCESSWIRE / October 17, 2024 / XMAR is pleased to announce the launch of the shipping industry's first comprehensive digital bunker trading platform, now in a closed pilot phase. XMAR's AI-powered platform connects users with a network of over 1,500 verified suppliers across 500 global ports , offering a more streamlined experience for bunker fuel procurement. These figures have been sourced and verified through internal data, ensuring reliability and accuracy. With a single enquiry, users receive multiple competitive offers and gain transparency throughout the purchasing process.\nCompanies can now join the waitlist on xmar.com to experience the platform during the pilot phase. Early participants will have the chance to help fine-tune the platform while benefiting from features such as 30-day financing and simplified order management.\nSimplified and Transparent Bunker Procurement\nUnlike conventional bunker procurement platforms, XMAR is designed to offer more than just data. The platform enables users to submit one enquiry and receive multiple competitive offers, significantly reducing the effort involved in coordinating with multiple suppliers. A live chat feature is available for each order, allowing users to receive prompt responses and real-time support.\n\"XMAR provides full transparency and control over the bunker purchasing process,\" explains Christoph Stork, CEO of XMAR. \"Users can manage their orders, documents, and payment deadlines with ease while having access to 1,500 suppliers across 500 ports worldwide .

SMEs, who have often been underserved in a market dominated by larger corporations, can now access the same benefits of efficiency and cost savings through XMAR.\n\"Our goal is to level the playing field for SMEs,\" says Stork. \"With XMAR, companies can source bunker fuel more efficiently while benefiting from fewer points of contact and a streamlined process where all steps-from offer to payment-are managed in one place.\"\nFlexible Finance and Comprehensive Order Management\nIn addition to simplifying bunker fuel sourcing, XMAR also offers financial support to SMEs through flexible credit terms. This allows companies to manage cash flow more effectively while securing the best possible fuel deals. Users also benefit from having a complete record of all their orders, documents, and payment deadlines consolidated in one place, making it easier to manage their fuel sourcing operations.\nJoin the Waitlist Today\nWhile the platform is in its pilot phase, XMAR is inviting companies to join the waitlist at xmar.com and participate in shaping the future of digital bunker trading.
