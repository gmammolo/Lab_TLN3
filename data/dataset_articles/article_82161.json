  "text": "AI creative audio studio Wondercraft has released a new feature that lets users find their inner Cecil B. DeMille by giving more control to direct the AI-generated voices they select for their podcasts. The new Director Mode allows users to direct performances through a chat interface. That means they will be able to do things such as instructing the virtual AI-generated characters to adopt specific accents, emotions, and even unique speech patterns. Wondercraft says the result is that users will be able to leverage AI voices to express complex emotional narratives and subtleties with greater ease.\nUsers of the new Director Mode will give the AI voices performance instructions through a simple chat interface. Not only will then be able to guide the voice on different emotions, moods, accents, and tones, but also be able to offer creative possibilities. It says they range from telling the AI voice to “speak English with a strong French accent” to “sound excited but you’re trying to hide it,” or combine the two.\n“Users can now ask their Wondercraft voice characters to authentically act out their scripts — gasp, laugh, cheer, sound insecure, sarcastic or even speak like they have a mouthful of food in a New Jersey accent,” says Oskar Serrander, co-founder at Wondercraft. “Director Mode puts you in the coveted Director’s chair with complete control of the theatrical performance when producing ads, voice-overs or content.”\nWondercraft’s platform leverages the latest AI innovations from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and a range of large language and voice models. With the launch of Director Mode, Wondercraft becomes the first audio platform to integrate OpenAI’s newest and most advanced voice model into its production studio.\nDirector Mode taps into Wondercraft’s extensive library of voice characters and the platform’s voice cloning feature, available to Pro and Enterprise users. The combination offers virtually limitless possibilities for creating distinct, engaging audio content for advertising, video voice-overs and content.\n“With Director Mode, Wondercraft is evolving to a must-have tool in the modern marketer’s tech stack,” Serrander said. “This feature represents a big leap forward in our mission to provide fast, affordable, safe and secure pro-quality audio creation in any language for brands and creative teams.”\nDirector Mode builds on Wondercraft’s Parrot Mode, which was released earlier this year and enabled AI voices to mimic a user’s own intonations and pronunciations. Using Parrot Mode, creatives can also direct AI voices to deliver lines with a specific tone or intonation to achieve their creative vision. AI then edits the production, adjust for things like voice speed, performing voice-over retakes, and tap into a library of music and sound effects.\nAfter launching in beta in 2023, Wondercraft has already been used by over 60,000 creators, writers, entrepreneurs, advertisers and brands. In January, the company announced it had secured $3 million in seed funding. It is already being embraced by production studios including Wondery, Amazon, Acast, DAX, Paytunes, Audacia, and Otonal, among others.",
