  "text": "On the heels of its second overall victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Ferrari has unveiled its latest top-of-the-line hypercar, the F80. Equipped with a hybrid powertrain that makes a total of 1,200 horsepower, the supercar will no doubt be the terror of lap records the world over. Unusually for the brand, the F80 is not powered by a V12 engine. Instead, it gets a twin-turbo V6 and three electric motors. But don’t be disappointed, the powertrain was inspired by the automaker’s Formula One and World Endurance Championship racecars, both of which use an electrified V6. As a result, the internal combustion engine under the hood is a beast. Pumping out 900 hp on its own, the engine has the highest specific output of any Ferrari engine ever (meaning that it is pound-for-pound the most powerful engine the legendary firm has ever developed). To make it feel like a Ferrari, the engine revs to 9,000 rpm and its turbochargers can be spun up electrically to eliminate turbo lag. The electric motors help get the F80 all the way up to the 1,200 hp mark, and two are located at the front axle. With each motor powering its own wheel, the F80 can take advantage of torque vectoring technology, which helps it through the corners. The motors cannot, however, propel the car on their own because Ferrari decided that no one would want an electric-only mode for their hypercar. Further assisting it in the twisty stuff is the active suspension. This keeps the car comfortable in the real world but perfectly flat on the track. Keeping the car level when it's going fast is especially important because the F80 uses underfloor aerodynamics, just like Ferrari’s racecars. Known as the ground effect, the technique carefully channels the air passing under the car to create suction that glues it to the track, while generating much less drag than a big over body wing. Despite that, the F80 also uses a big wing on the back of the car, but it can move around to generate less drag and downforce or more of both, depending on what the driver needs. In total, the aerodynamic setup generates a massive 1,000 kg (2,204 lbs) of downforce to help the hypercar tackle corners insanely quickly. To help drivers hit apexes with precision, the F80 is the first car to feature Ferrari’s new steering wheel, which is smaller and thinner than the brand’s other wheels, making it easier to see through. The automaker adds that the unit is also shaped to make it easier to grab without gloves. Elsewhere, the interior is inspired by Ferrari’s single-seat racers, giving it an offset 1+ seating setup, and placing the driver in a laid-back position. Ferrari plans to make just 799 examples of this special hybrid hypercar.",
