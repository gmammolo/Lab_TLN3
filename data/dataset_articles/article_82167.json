  "text": "West Virginia is spending nearly $5 million to improve the state’s roadside weather stations.\nRoad Weather Information System (RWIS) stations that collect data on weather and road conditions, then transmit that information to the West Virginia Department of Transportation’s traffic management center, will be upgraded or installed by Specialty Groups Inc., according to a news release .\nOfficials said these stations will allow the state DOT to promptly alert drivers to adverse road conditions in real time, enhancing road safety.\n“RWIS is an excellent example of how the WVDOT can utilize technology to have instant access to information about local conditions to make decisions that will result in more effective management of the roadway system and provide important and timely information to motorists,” said Ted Whitmore, director of the state’s DOT’s Traffic Engineering Division.\nLand Line offers a resources page with links to traffic information in all 50 states. Gov. Jim Justice and the West Virginia Department of Transportation announced today the award of a $4.7 million contract to Specialty Groups Inc. to upgrade and install Road Weather Information System stations in West Virginia.

Jim Justice said. “We want everyone traveling in West Virginia to feel secure and prepared.”\nLand Line has compiled updated information on chain laws across the nation. In addition to alerting drivers of road conditions via WV 511 and other platforms, the roadside weather stations collect data to use in optimizing snow removal and ice control operations, as well as in creating site-specific forecasts for sections of highway, the news release said.\nCollected data also is shared with the National Weather Service for forecasting purposes.\nWVDOT operates approximately 40 Road Weather Information System stations across the state.
