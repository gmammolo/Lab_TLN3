  "text": "feel good [Peter Barr](/news/peter-barr/102158484)and [John Dobson](/news/john-dobson/10964032) In short: A \"whale orgy\" off southern WA south highlights the unusual breeding behaviour of the mammals. Southern right whales often breed in groups of up to 20 in waters off the Australian coast. What's next? Mating is a promising sign for whale species still recovering from decades of whaling. A mating frenzy captured on camera off Western Australia's south coast is a promising sign for southern right numbers still recovering from decades of whaling, according to a marine biologist. The footage shot by Albany resident Brett Peake shows a group of about six to seven whales mating in a group. Marine biologist Pia Markovic says the mating ritual is more common in southern rights than other whale species. \"You could have five whales there or you could have up to 20 whales,\" she said. \"They look to be rolling over each other and rubbing up against each other, which is pretty typical of whale sex.\" Mating led by female of species Mating can start with a female southern right putting out a call which travels underwater, Ms Markovich said. \"The males will hear that and they'll swim over and, basically, a whale orgy starts,\" she said. \"It's almost like a dance when there's physical stamina, they're agile and it's quite graceful actually.\" Ms Markovic said the female would lead, with the male \"mirroring\" her movements. It can lead to male whales fighting for attention. \"The males will push and shove, but it's relatively non-violent and they kind of just bump into each other like bumper cars,\" she said. Mating before migration south Multiple males will mate with one female, creating the best chance of impregnation. Ms Markovic said southern right whales had the largest testicles of any animal on earth. \"They can weigh up to 500kg each, so they have one tonne of testicles that are inside their body,\" she said. The whales migrate along WA’s west coast and can breed in waters from Exmouth to the South Australian border before heading to sub-Antarctic waters. Population rebounding from whaling The southern right population was estimated to be 50,000 to 70,000 in the 1700s, before whaling decimated the population. There were fewer than 300 whales left in the 1920s, according to WWF Australia. The most recent estimate has the population sitting at 3,000 or so. Albany was the last commercial whaling operation in Australia until its closure in 1978. Scientists are tracking southern rights through calcified skin markings on their heads and the population is slowly rebounding from whaling. \"It's a lot less than the original pre-whaling numbers,\" Ms Markovic said. \"But by mapping these individuals, scientists are seeing an increase about five or six per cent each year, which is fantastic.\" ABC Great Southern — local news in your inbox ABC Privacy Collection Statement .",
