  "text": "Recognizes U.S. Lunar Mission “Saviors” with Congressional Tribute\nMOREHEAD, KY (Oct. 17, 2024) – U.S. Rep. Harold “Hal” Rogers (KY-05) visited Morehead State University’s Space Science Center on Thursday to announce a federal earmark totaling nearly $10 million in Community Project Funding to broaden the region’s highly competitive deep space network. The funding will be used to enhance the two space tracking stations on campus to support future government-funded and commercial space programs.\n“The staff and students at Morehead State are now involved in some of the United States’ most innovative and historic space missions. This project will allow the space science center to support future NASA programs, including NASA’s Near Space Network, Artemis and the Moon to Mars Program,” said Congressman Rogers, chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds science-related federal agencies . “This means that students here at MSU will have first-hand access to more lunar and deep space tracking services that they cannot get anywhere else in the country.”\n“We are incredibly grateful for the support and leadership of Congressman Hal Rogers in securing this critical funding for Morehead State’s Space Science Program. His dedication to advancing science and technology in our region has been instrumental in positioning MSU as a leader in space research and exploration,” said Dr. Jay Morgan, President of Morehead State University . “This funding will allow us to expand our capabilities, provide our students with unmatched hands-on experiences, and contribute to the growing space economy in our region and in Kentucky. It’s an exciting time for Morehead State, and we thank Congressman Rogers for helping make this possible.”\nCongressman Rogers also requested a $7.5 million Community Project Funding earmark for fiscal year 2025 MSU’s Space Science Center to provide payload operations for government and commercial space stations. The funding request was approved by the House Appropriations Committee and is pending on-going budget negotiations.\n“This funding is a game-changer for Morehead State’s Space Science Program. It enables us to further enhance our research and technological capabilities, allowing our students and faculty to participate in groundbreaking projects that contribute directly to the future of space exploration,” said Dr. Ben Malphrus, Director of the MSU Space Science Center . “We’re deeply thankful to Congressman Hal Rogers for his vision and continued support, which is helping us shape the next generation of space scientists and engineers right here in Eastern Kentucky.”\nTo highlight the importance of investing in Morehead State’s work at the Space Science Center, Congressman Rogers recognized the staff and students who saved the United States’ latest mission to the moon after a troubled landing damaged the Odysseus Lander, “Odie,” cutting-off communications back to Earth.\n“Morehead State was the only conduit between NASA and the private company that sent the lunar lander to the moon to conduct research. The multi-million-dollar mission was in jeopardy of failure, until the staff and students here in our Appalachian Mountains worked around the clock for 72 hours to save that historic mission,” said Congressman Rogers. “I submitted a tribute in the Congressional Record to commemorate the team that NASA Administrator Bill Nelson dubbed as the ‘saviors’ of the nation’s first lunar landing since the Apollo era.”\nThe Congressional Record is preserved in the Library of Congress, recognizing the work of MSU staff members, Dr. Malphrus, Chloe Hart from Ashland, Emily Walter from Pikeville, Nathan Fite, Christopher Smith and Seifala Moustaffa, as well as students Mila Shearer and Carrie Bruce.\nFor more information about Congressman Rogers work in Washington and at home in Kentucky, visit halrogers.house.gov and follow him on social media.",
