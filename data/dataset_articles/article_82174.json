  "text": "Wisconsin's celestial show: Supermoon meets bright comet\nWisconsin's night sky will host a supermoon and comet, creating a stunning celestial display for stargazers.\nWisconsin's night sky will host a supermoon and comet, creating a stunning celestial display for stargazers.\nWisconsin residents are in for a celestial treat as a supermoon coincides with the appearance of a potentially bright comet.\nThe full moon on Thursday will be the third of four consecutive supermoons this year. Known as the Hunter's Moon, it will appear larger and brighter than usual due to its close proximity to Earth.\nAdding to the spectacle, Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas is also expected to be visible in the night sky.\nSkywatchers in Wisconsin can look for the comet low in the western sky after sunset.\nThe supermoon will rise in the east as twilight ends on Thursday evening. Saturn will be visible high in the southeastern sky, while the bright planet Venus will be low in the west-southwestern horizon.\n\"This should be a good season for Saturn viewing, especially through a backyard telescope,\" said Gordon Johnston, a program executive at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nAstronomers advise using binoculars or a small telescope for the best views of the comet, especially from urban areas with light pollution. The moon's brightness may interfere with comet viewing.\nStargazers are encouraged to find dark sky locations away from city lights for optimal viewing conditions.\nWhile supermoons aren't scientifically significant, the celestial effect inspires people to appreciate the beauty of the night sky.",
