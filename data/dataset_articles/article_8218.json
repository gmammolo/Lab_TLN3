  "text": "There are high hopes for Ole Miss as the 2024 college football season quickly approaches, and Ulysses Bentley IV is set to play a big role. The sixth-year running back chose to forgo the NFL Draft to exhaust his final year of eligibility with one last dance with the Rebels.\nHe is doing so in style!\nBentley has one of the best names in sports. When is the last time that you encountered someone named Ulysses? When is the last time you encountered someone who is the fourth? His combination first and last name, and suffix, is high-class and powerful.\nOf course, there is only one vehicle that matches the distinguished nature of ‘Ulysses Bentley IV’ and it has everything to do with his last name. It is only fitting that he would drive a ‘Winged B.’\nAnd as of this week, he does! Bentley is driving… a\nBentley.\nThe 23-year-old ball-carrier drove his new luxury whip on the field at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium while Kendrick Lamar’s ‘They Not Like Us’ blared in the background. If that wasn’t cool enough, Bentley’s Bentley matches Ole Miss’ slick powder blue jerseys. (Actually a much better shade!)\nIt gets even cooler!\nUlysses’ nickname is “Bentley Doo” or just “Doo.” They got him a new license plate to match.\nAdmittedly, I do not know the backstory to this vehicle. I don’t know if Bentley purchased the car with his NIL money, if it’s a lease as part of his agreement with The Grove Collective, or if it’s just for the photoshoot. The only thing that matters is that it looks sick!\nUlysses Bentley IV is flying way under the radar in the\ncollege football space. He was one of the most productive backs in the SEC last season, if not the most productive back in the SEC. That trend should continue behind an even better offensive line as the primary ball-carrier.\nHis incredible name is one thing. His on-field play is another!\nBentley is a lot like the new powder blue Bentley. Sleek, powerful, fast and luxurious!",
