  "text": "By Colin Kellaher\nMerck & Co. on Thursday reported further positive results from a late-stage study of its proposed clesrovimab vaccine aimed at protecting infants from respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, disease.\nMerck said the Phase 2b/3 pivotal study evaluating a single dose of clesrovimab administered to healthy preterm and full-term infants met all prespecified endpoints, with consistent results through both the five-month and six-month time points.\nThe Rahway, N.J., drugmaker said clesrovimab reduced the incidence of RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory infections as well as RSV-associated hospitalizations.\nRSV, a contagious virus that is the leading cause of hospitalization for healthy infants, can cause inflammation in the airways, leading to difficulty breathing.\nMerck in July reported that the study had met its primary safety and efficacy through 150 days.\nMerck said clesrovimab has the potential to become the first and only approved immunization designed to protect infants with the same single dose regardless of weight for the duration of their first RSV season. The company said it aims to make clesrovimab available for infants as early as the 2025-26 RSV season.\nWrite to Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n10-17-24 1814ET\nShare © Dow Jones - 2024",
