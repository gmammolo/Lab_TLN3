  "text": "Forgot Username or Password Date (MENAFN- Newsfile Corp) Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - October 17, 2024) - Nextleaf Solutions Ltd. (CSE: OILS) (OTCQB: OILFF) (FSE: L0MA) (\"Nextleaf\", \"OILS\", or the \"Company\") , a leading life science firm and licensed cannabis processor, is excited to announce the launch of an innovative, industry-leading virtual tour of their Coquitlam B.C. processing facility, featuring the Company's multi-patented extraction technology. The on-demand, self-guided, 4-part tour was made possible by a grant from the Canadian Digital Adoption Program (CDAP). This level of transparency into cannabis processing paired with user-navigated content is a first-of-its-kind offered in the Canadian cannabis industry. \"A sustainable industry is built on trust, legitimacy, and accessibility,\" shares Emma Andrews, CEO of Nextleaf. \"I believe we have a responsibility as pioneers in the legal landscape, and as a publicly traded company looking to rebuild confidence in the sector, to offer as much visibility as possible into how ingredients, and products are made. This sets the standard for what consumers deserve and should expect from the industry.\" Virtual Facility Tour of Nextleaf Labs Nextleaf Virtual Facility Tour To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit: The virtual facility tour includes 360-degree video at 4 tour stops: Primary Extraction, Distillation, Manufacturing, and The Vault. Within each stop along the tour are additional embedded educational videos creating a robust and engaging learning on-demand environment. The specialized 360-degree footage used in Nextleaf's virtual facility tour was filmed and edited by Ben Taft, Founder of 360 Immersion, a BC based videographer. This style of content allows the user to self-navigate; similar technology is used in applications like Google Maps. Join the virtual facility tour here: . Scaling Up Through Digital Adoption The Canadian Digital Adoption Program (CDAP) is designed to enable Canadian businesses to invest in digital strategies to improve operational efficiency, productivity, and generate business using technology. Grants offered by CDAP are now fully subscribed. \"We regularly host local partners for small-group, in-person tours, but we've always had a bigger vision to scale the impact to national reach and offer the experience on-demand,\" comments Ryan Hirsch, Senior Marketing Manager at Nextleaf. Hirsch continues, \"I've seen first-hand how this level of transparency builds trust, and because of the CDAP grant we were able to make our vision a reality. This is a backstage pass for all our stakeholders, from curious consumers to retail partners, provincial authorities to regulators, policy makers, and investors.\" Nextleaf has been actively integrating digital adoption strategies across all areas of their business to support operational effectiveness, and scaling-up for future growth. In addition to the work completed under the CDAP grant, the Company has also recently invested in ERP software for integration across inventory and accounting, and an EQMS system for quality assurance.
