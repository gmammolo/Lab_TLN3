Stakeholders said the first turbines have started spinning, feeding electricity into Victoria’s grid. When the 1.3-gigawatt wind farm reaches completion in 2027, it is expected to power 765,000 homes in Victoria and meet 9 percent of the state's current energy demand. The Golden Plains complex also will be coupled with 300 megawatts of battery-storage capacity upon completion. “Victoria is the clean energy investment capital of Australia,” said Lily D'Ambrosio, energy minister in the Parliament of Victoria, “and this project is another example of how Victoria’s ambitious renewable-energy policies are creating jobs and driving the renewables sector.\" TagEnergy, a global renewable energy enterprise, began the first stage",
