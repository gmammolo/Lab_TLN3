  "text": "Op-Ed By Dr. Sean Subas . Photo: Hurricane Milton Intensified To Cat 5 Threatening Florida’s West Coast As hurricanes Helene and Milton pound the southern U.S., the devastating physical impact is undeniable—destroyed homes, widespread power outages, and entire communities displaced. Yet, amidst this destruction, there’s an opportunity for transformation. These relentless storms shine a bright spotlight on the urgent need to overhaul our disaster forecasting tools, and at the center of this revolution is Generative AI (GenAI).\nThe current hurricane season underscores the limits of traditional forecasting tools, which, despite their advancements, still face challenges in accuracy and speed. This is where GenAI can lead the charge, offering unparalleled advancements in prediction and response. Imagine a network of GenAI-controlled drones, patrolling storm-ravaged skies in real-time, providing live data to forecast models and ensuring no critical detail is missed. These AI-driven systems can quickly assess rapidly changing weather patterns and anticipate storm shifts in ways humans simply can’t match.\nREAD: Hurricane Helene Insured Losses Climb To $1.3 Billion In Florida\nOne such application already in the works is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) use of GenAI in hurricane hunting. Their planes, designed to fly into the heart of the storm, collect invaluable data. However, traditional methods have their limits. On one mission, NOAA’s planes were violently tossed around inside Helene’s turbulent core. With GenAI, we could deploy autonomous drones, sparing pilots from these dangerous conditions while feeding real-time storm data to improve forecasting accuracy.\nGenAI doesn’t stop there. It can enhance the predictive power of our models, using vast datasets to analyze storm patterns and offer better forecasts. By processing millions of data points from previous storms, GenAI systems could predict not only a storm’s path but also its likely impact on specific regions—how much flooding to expect, what areas are most at risk of landslides, and how the winds will affect power grids.\nThis level of precision and rapidity could save countless lives. Early warnings powered by GenAI could prompt faster evacuations, better preparedness, and more effective resource allocation for affected regions. The economic savings from such accuracy could also be enormous, as governments and organizations could avoid the unnecessary expenditures that often come with over-preparing or misallocating resources.\nREAD: Florida AG Commissioner Urges USDA To Issue Disaster Declaration For Hurricane Milton Agricultural Damage\nThe power of GenAI is not just about prediction; it’s about real-time responsiveness. Drones equipped with GenAI could autonomously decide where to deliver relief supplies based on evolving storm conditions and needs. They could also guide rescue operations, detecting areas hardest hit or most in need of assistance. Such innovation could transform how we respond to natural disasters, helping us act faster and smarter.\nBut to fully harness the potential of GenAI, we need investment and collaboration across sectors. Governments, tech companies, and research institutions must work together to implement these systems and ensure they are designed for public safety, not just profit. This is an opportunity to make our world safer, more resilient, and better prepared for the storms ahead.\nThe 2024 hurricane season is a clear call to action. GenAI offers a path forward, a way to revolutionize disaster forecasting and response. It’s time we embrace this technology—not just to predict the next storm, but to protect lives in the face of nature’s fiercest challenges.\nDr. Sean Subas is an expert in AI and public policy, focusing on the intersection of technology and electoral integrity.\nPlease make a small donation to the Tampa Free Press to help sustain independent journalism .
