Players will take the role of a Traveler, exploring a wasteland ravaged by a mysterious event known as “the Change.” Players will navigate this dangerous world filled with monstrous abominations while unraveling a twisted time travel narrative.\nIn a statement, Piotr Babieno, CEO of Bloober Team, expressed the studio’s excitement:\n“Following the success of Silent Hill 2 , we are proud to present Cronos , an exciting new IP from Bloober Team. Our commitment to redefining the horror genre continues with this survival horror title, which represents a natural progression of our creative vision and our studio's strategy.

We can't wait to share it with the world in 2025.”\nCronos: The New Dawn is Blooper’s first original franchise in the survival horror genre, following the studio’s recent success with Silent Hill 2 Remake , published by Konami. Silent Hill 2 Remake sold 1 million copies in a week since the game launched on October 8, 2024.\nCronos: The New Dawn Will launch next year for Xbox Series X|S, PC, and PS5.\nWhat do you think about the Bloober’s new game?
