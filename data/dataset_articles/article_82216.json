  "text": "The highly anticipated Roblox -inspired MapleStory Worlds has finally been released outside of Asia, but one of its biggest features is noticeably absent from the release: MapleLand . For many, MapleLand is the best shot of Classic MapleStory , also known to many as OSMS or Old School MapleStory . We’ve put together everything we know about MapleLand including its release date and what players can expect on release.\nScreenshot by Destructoid Release Date – When does MapleLand release on MapleStory Worlds? Even though MapleLand was originally believed to have been a launch game on MapleStory Worlds , it appears that has changed.\nAccording to the developer, MapleLand is trying to come to the global release of MapleStory Worlds very soon after the global release , which was on October 16, 2024. The entire MapleLand game has to be translated from Korean to English in order to make the final transition to the global release of MapleStory Worlds , which shouldn’t take long.\nThe best way to keep track of the progress of MapleLand is to login to MapleStory Worlds and check the new releases section. Once MapleLand is translated and releases on MapleStory Worlds , it will surely be the most played game on the new platform.\nDetails – What is MapleLand? Now let’s talk about what MapleLand actually is. At its core, MapleLand is a creation of the classic original MapleStory that tries to replicate the experience of the original MapleStory MMORPG launch. Millions of people grew up playing MapleStory , a popular 2D sidescroller MMORPG that was released back in 2003. Since then, the game has undergone many changes in its over two-decade lifespan, leading many players to reminisce about the classic days of MapleStory , when the MMORPG was a bit more hardcore but also a bit more streamlined and rewarding.\nOn October 16, 2024, Nexon released its newest project, MapleStory Worlds , globally. Previously it was only available in South Korea, but players globally can now access MapleStory Worlds .\nIn summary, MapleStory Worlds is similar to Roblox in that it provides a tool for players to create their own worlds and even games inside of MapleStory Worlds using the popular MapleStory engine. Similar to how Roblox has a variety of many different games in various genres including RPGs, simulation games, adventure games, and more, MapleStory Worlds will let players create any sort of game they want using MapleStory systems and assets.\nThe most popular creation on the South Korea version of MapleStory Worlds is MapleLand . Created by the developer behind the most well-known MapleStory private server dev in South Korea, formerly known as Whitestar and their old school MapleStory server called OdinMS. At its core, MapleLand creates an authentic 1-to-1 classic MapleStory (OSMS) experience, allowing players to relive the original launch days of the popular MMORPG.\nAll of MapleLand is created and run through MapleStory Worlds , meaning there’s no fear of copyright infringement-style shutdowns for MapleLand , and the developer can continue to support it and build upon it, creating a World of Warcraft Classic like situation for MapleStory .\nWhether you’re looking to try the classic MapleStory experience for the first time, or looking to relive the old launch days, MapleLand via MapleStory Worlds will be the best way for you to do so.\nYou can download the MapleStory Worlds client directly from the Nexon website .",
