  "text": "USDA Announces Approval of D-SNAP for Arkansas Disaster Areas WASHINGTON, June 21, 2024 – The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced that low-income Arkansas residents recovering from the severe storms and tornadoes beginning May 24, 2024, could be eligible for a helping hand from the USDA’s Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP). Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said that approximately 2,900 households that may not normally be eligible under regular Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) rules may qualify for D-SNAP – if they meet certain criteria, including the disaster income limits and have qualifying disaster-related expenses. “USDA stands with our neighbors in Arkansas to provide vital food assistance as they deal with the aftermath of the severe storms and tornadoes,” said Secretary Vilsack. “Residents of Arkansas will benefit from this waiver as they recover from the recent devastation of storms.” To be eligible for D-SNAP, a household must either live or work in an identified disaster area, have been affected by the disaster, and meet certain D-SNAP eligibility criteria. Eligible households will receive one month of benefits – equal to the maximum monthly amount for a SNAP household of their size – that they can use to purchase groceries at SNAP-authorized stores or from [select retailers online](/snap/online) to meet their temporary food needs as they settle back home following the disaster. Arkansas will operate its D-SNAP application from June 24 through June 30, 2024. Arkansas will share additional information about D-SNAP application dates and locations through local media. The timing of D-SNAP varies with the unique circumstances of each disaster, but always begins after commercial channels of food distribution have been restored and families are able to purchase and prepare food at home. Before operating a D-SNAP, a state must ensure that the proper public information, staffing, and resources are in place. The D-SNAP announcement today is the latest USDA action taken to help Arkansas residents cope with the severe storms and its aftermath. For more information about this and other available aid, callers from Arkansas can dial 2-1-1 or 1-800-651-3493.

USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service works to end hunger and improve food and nutrition security through a suite of more than [16 nutrition assistance programs](/fns-101-fact-sheets-all), such as the school breakfast and lunch programs, WIC and SNAP. Together, these programs serve 1 in 4 Americans over the course of a year, promoting consistent and equitable access to healthy, safe, and affordable food essential to optimal health and well-being. FNS also provides science-based nutrition recommendations through the co-development of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. FNS’s report, “ [Leveraging the White House Conference to Promote and Elevate Nutrition Security: The Role of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service](/nutrition-security/fns-role),” highlights ways the agency will support the Biden-Harris Administration’s National Strategy, released in conjunction with the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health in September 2022.
