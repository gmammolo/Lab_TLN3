  "text": "The biggest and brightest supermoon of the year is rising this week.\nNASA says the moon will appear full from Tuesday evening through Friday morning. So you have plenty of time to take it in.\nHowever, there's a small window between Wednesday evening and Thursday morning when the moon will be closest to Earth, appearing most brilliant.\nWhen and where to see October's supermoon\nUnlike constellations and meteor showers, the https://sciencealert.com/supermoon is easily visible from almost any location on Earth.\n\"It is something that people can see, even if they live in a city, it's really easy to observe. You don't need special equipment,\" Jennifer L. Hoffman, director of the Chamberlin Observatory, told Business Insider.\nThe term supermoon refers to when a full, or new, moon occurs around the same time as the moon's closest approach to Earth, called perigee.\nThat's what will happen, starting Wednesday evening, which will result in a supermoon that appears about 14% brighter than average, Space.com reported.\nThe moon reaches perigee at about 8:50 p.m. ET on Wednesday. It will be 221,938 miles away – about 17,000 miles closer than average. Then, it will grow overnight, officially reaching full moon on Thursday at 7:26 a.m. ET.\nBecause of when perigee and the full moon fall, the best time to get the full effect is Wednesday or Thursday at moonrise, Wes Ryle, an astronomer with the Cincinnati Observatory, told BI.\nMoreover, when the moon is near the horizon, it creates an optical illusion where the moon looks larger because there are usually trees or buildings for a sense of scale, as opposed to when it's high in the sky.\nYou can check what time the moon will rise over the eastern horizon in your location with Time and Date's moonrise and moonset calculator.\nWhile you don't need special equipment to see the supermoon, Ryle suggests checking it out through a telescope, if you can.\n\"Just being able to see the dramatic increase in detail that comes with the telescope view is always a neat thing to experience with someone,\" he said.\nThis week's moon is the third of four consecutive supermoons this year. The next one will be in November.\nWhat makes this week's moon unique is that perigee and the full moon coincide most closely compared to the other supermoons, making it the biggest and brightest supermoon all year.\n\"This one is technically the largest supermoon of the four, edging out the one in September by just a little bit,\" Ryle said.\nThis week's full moon is also called the Hunter's Moon, taking its name from the season when animals bulk up for the cold months ahead and hunters store meat for the winter, according to the Farmers' Almanac.\nSupermoons are relatively common, so if you miss this one, you won't need to wait long for the next one. \"They do kind of pair up for a little bit and you'll tend to get a couple of supermoons in a row,\" Ryle said.\nHowever, sometimes a supermoon will coincide with a new moon, so it won't have the same effect of looking brighter than usual. This year, the four supermoons in a row are all full moons.\nIn 2025, there will be another cluster of supermoons in October, November, and December.\nThis article was originally published by Business Insider.",
