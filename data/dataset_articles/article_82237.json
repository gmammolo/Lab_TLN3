  "text": "( MENAFN - Newsfile Corp) Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - October 17, 2024) - Badlands Resources Inc. (TSXV: BLDS) (FSE: B7Q) (\" Badlands \" or the \" Company \") is pleased to announce the successful results from its fall 2023 field exploration program, identifying multiple high-grade Gold trends at the Bella Project, located in the Black Hills of South Dakota.\nNews Highlights\nFive Main High-Grade gold Trends: The company identified five main high-grade gold trends with approximately 20 km of strike length at surface through mapping and sampling. Grab Samples Returned Assays up to 20 g/t Au. Out of the 420 grab samples collected, 60 samples returned over 5 g/t Au .\nGold mineralization hosted in Banded-Iron Formation. Only 40% of the prospective mineralized unit has been prospected by the Company. Systematic Approach. The initial program has assisted in prioritizing the main targets for advanced exploration given that the mineralized unit has a surface expression of 50 km.\nDale Ginn, President and CEO of Badlands, commented, \"The initial success of the 2023 Field Program gives confidence of the gold prospectivity in the Black Hills. Historically, the Company's focus was drilling deep extensions of the Standby Mine, but these samples reinforce the high-grade gold potential at surface. Badlands will continue to advance the near surface targets through exploration efforts of the team.\"\nFigure 1 . Badlands 2023 Field Exploration Program, identifying five major gold trend at the Bella Project\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nDiscussion of Results\nThe Bella project covers a large under-explored package of banded iron formation hosted in a greenstone to amphibolite facies sedimentary and volcanic succession. The project shares striking similarities to the Homestake Mine which is located 30 km to the north. At both locations, the gold is concentrated in the local iron formation, particularly where it is has been thickened by regional folding. The iron formation at the two locations has been noted to be stratigraphically distinct but nearly identical in composition.\nBadlands collected a total of 420 rock samples to investigate prospective areas identified from Lidar and historical data. Results have highlighted five trends which the Company plans to follow up on with systematic surface sampling and possible drill targeting. These trends have been named Lookout, Standard, Cochrane, King of West, and Montezuma.\nLookout Trend\nThe Lookout trend extends 2.5 km southeast from the historic Standby Mine. The majority of samples were collected from the altered, sheered, and folded Rochford iron formation which locally encompasses the Nahant Schist and Rapid Creek Greenstone. Grab sample highlights include 19.2 g/t Au, 18.95 g/t Au, and 17.7 g/t Au.\nFigure 2 .

The north of the trend hosts the historic Standard Mine, while the south hosts the Gold King Mine. Production numbers for both mines are unknown due to incomplete records. Sampling highlights include 17.50 g/t Au and 16.15 g/t Au.\nFigure 3 .

Sampling returned anomalous results including 9.76 g/t Au and 9.39 g/t Au.\nFigure 4 .

Historic mines in the area have recovered over 1,780 ounces1 of gold. Iron formation within the area is surrounded by Poverty Gulch Slate. Anomalous results include 16.8 g/t Au and 15.6 g/t Au in grab samples.\nFigure 5 .

It is bordered by greenstone to the west and schist to the east. Anomalous results include 12.5 g/t Au.\nFigure 6 .

The samples were analyzed for gold using fire assay and ICP-AES (code Au-ICP21). Overlimit samples (>10 g/t Au) were given a gravimetric finish (codeAu-GRA21).\nThe Company also advises that the private placement announced in its news release of July 30, 2024, has been cancelled.\nAbout Badlands\nBadlands, through its wholly owned subsidiary, is a gold focused exploration company in the Black Hills, South Dakota. The Company has strategically consolidated 7,858 acres, 20 km along trend from the Homestake Mine that produced 42 million ounces of gold. The Bella Project has over 90% of exposed Banded Iron Formation not covered by sampling and is determined to explore the near surface potential.\nOn Behalf of the Board of Directors\nBADLANDS RESOURCES INC.\nR.
