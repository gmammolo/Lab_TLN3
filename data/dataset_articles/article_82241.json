  "text": "Summary\nNovember 20, 2024 | 1:00 PM – 2:30 PM ET\nSession 4: Inclusive Leadership in STEM\nLeaders in STEM have the opportunity and duty to foster environments where diverse voices are heard, valued, and included in decision-making processes, innovation, and research. They recognize the value of different perspectives and experiences in driving innovation and problem-solving.\nThe lack of diversity in STEM is amplified for positions of power. Groups that are the most underrepresented and marginalized in STEM (Black, Latino/a/X, Indigenous and people of color) are the least represented in leadership positions. In this session, we will learn about why leadership in STEM can be less diverse and how we can work together to ameliorate this issue. We will also explore strategies for being an inclusive leader that can be implemented at multiple stages of a person’s career.\nAbout the series\nThe Inclusion in STEM series delves into a few of the many topics that are essential for actively cultivating a culture of inclusion in STEM, including defining inclusion, promoting inclusive pipelines through mentorship, finding solidarity and power through joining affinity groups, being an inclusive leader, and communicating research in a way that centers inclusion, equity, and intersectionality. Learn more about the series and explore the full lineup of events.\nSponsor\nThought Partner\nPricing\nMember: Free\nNonmember: $20.00\nBy attending this session, you will receive an exclusive 50% discount applicable to any of the following events in the series.\nRegistration\nThe event is open for registration.",
