  "text": "Honor X60 Pro The X60 Pro features a stunning 6.78-inch curved OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. It has a sharp resolution of 1,224 x 2,700 pixels. The screen supports 10-bit color depth and can reach a peak of 3,000 nits, utilizing 3,840Hz high-frequency PWM dimming for smooth brightness adjustments. While it’s waterproof, it lacks an official IP rating. The X60 Pro’s Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chip is a downgrade from the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 in the previous X50 Pro. Despite this, it allows for 4K video recording, unlike the regular X60, which maxes out at 1080p. Both models sport a 108MP main camera with a 2MP depth sensor, featuring 9-to-1 pixel binning for improved low-light performance. The front camera is an 8MP sensor housed in a pill-shaped punch hole. The Pro has an under-display fingerprint reader for a modern touch. With a robust 6,600mAh battery and fast 66W charging, the X60 Pro excels in endurance, offering around 25 hours of video playback. However, gaming performance only sees a slight increase, with 10 hours compared to 9 hours on the vanilla model. The X60 Pro supports dual-SIM 5G, Wi-Fi 5, and Bluetooth 5.1. There is a two-way satellite texting through the Beidou system for reliable messaging without cell service. Honor X60 The vanilla Honor X60 features a flat 6.8-inch LCD with a lower resolution of 1,080 x 2,412 pixels and a brightness of 850 nits. It still runs at 120Hz for smooth interactions. The front camera is also an 8MP sensor, set in a circular punch hole. While it shares the same rear camera setup as the Pro, it lacks 4K video recording capabilities due to its Dimensity 7025-Ultra chipset. Gizchina News of the week This model packs a 5,800mAh battery with a modest 35W charging speed, leading to 19 hours of video playback. It offers 8GB or 12GB of RAM and storage options of 128GB, 256GB, or 512 GB. All come running on MagicOS 8.0 based on Android 14. The X60 features dual-SIM 5G, Wi-Fi 5, and benefits from Bluetooth 5.3, providing a slight edge over the Pro. However, it lacks the Pro’s satellite texting feature. Pricing and Availability The Honor X60 is available in China, starting at CNY 1,200 (approximately $170, €155, or ₹14,200) for the 8GB/128GB model. Upgrade options include the 8GB/256GB for CNY 1,400, 12GB/256GB for CNY 1,600, and the top-tier 12GB/512GB for CNY 1,800. The X60 comes in Black, Green, and Silver color options.",
