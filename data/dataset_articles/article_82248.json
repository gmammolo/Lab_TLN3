  "text": "Posted By: [DVC](/members/39166/dvc.html), 10/17/2024 6:07:43 PM For those who lived through the '60s, it was a decade of tragedy and triumph. The often deadly quest for civil rights for Black Americans was a battle well worth fighting. The tragedy of Vietnam for those of us in uniform, (personally, I was on active-duty Navy and Marines from '65 to '75), tore a generation asunder [snip] However, the one truly unifying pride all felt during that fractious decade was the world class and very public and dramatic American scientific and engineering quest to meet the great challenge of President Kennedy: Comments: Watch the video, and note the relatively large steering angles on the rocket exhaust and the relatively high tilt angles of the rocket body necessary to make the large, yet precise corrections to put he rocket where it needs to be then the rocket throttles up to stop it's descent and come to a hover as the arms grab it. Impressive. Amazing, and financially a REAL game changer.",
