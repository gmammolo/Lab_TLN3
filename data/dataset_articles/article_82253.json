  "text": "Nissan’s redesign of its two-row, midsized Murano SUV comes nearly a decade after the model’s last major update, and features smoothed-out styling and a host of new technology.\nAmong the new offerings are an optional 360-degree-view camera system for parking, a front camera to improve the driver’s forward visibility below the hoodline, and a full-color head-up display.\nIn this article Arrow link The 2025 Nissan Murano: CR's Take Outside Inside What Drives It Active Safety and Driver Assistance More on SUVs CR's New & Used Car Ratings How to Navigate Today's Elevated New-Car Prices Best Deals on SUVs You Can Buy Right Now Worst Deals on New Cars Right Now CR's Trade-In Estimator\nPerhaps most notable is the retirement of Nissan’s long-enduring 3.5-liter V6 engine in favor of a variable compression 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder. The new engine will alter its compression ratio automatically to suit the driving situation—a lower ratio when more power is needed, such as during acceleration, and a higher ratio in situations when it’s not, such as cruising on the highway. We tested this engine in the Infiniti QX50 and found that neither acceleration nor fuel economy was outstanding.\nOn top of that, the new Murano will no longer have a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). The new model will have a nine-speed automatic transmission that, based on the performance of other similar units, is likely to provide smoother, more predictable shifts. ProPilot Assist, Nissan’s enhanced adaptive cruise control, will be available in the Murano for the first time.\nThe Murano will be positioned between the compact Nissan Rogue and the full-sized Armada , and it competes with two-row SUVs like the Chevrolet Blazer and Honda Passport . It will be built at Nissan’s plant in Smyrna, Tenn., and is slated to go on sale early next year.\nHere’s what we know so far.\nWhat it competes with: Chevrolet Blazer , Honda Passport , Jeep Grand Cherokee , Kia Sorento , Mazda CX-70 , Toyota Crown Signia , Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport\nPowertrain: 241-hp, 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine; 9-speed automatic transmission; front- or all-wheel drive\nPrice: $39,000-$50,000 (estimated)\nOn sale: Spring 2025\nCR's Take The midsized SUV segment is highly competitive, and the Murano hasn’t been redesigned since 2015. This long-awaited overhaul will undoubtedly make it more relevant among a number of other compelling options. The styling, technology, and interior appointments skew noticeably toward the premium end of the scale, and may even snag the attention of people who are also looking at models from Infiniti (also built by Nissan) and Lexus (Toyota’s luxury brand).\nThe previous model’s CVT was better than most, mostly thanks to the generous torque of the old V6 engine, but it could be quirky under load. The new nine-speed automatic that replaces it may improve the driving experience. Although the V6 was a gem that caused few problems, it has been replaced with a smaller turbocharged four-cylinder that doesn’t appear to offer much in the way of fuel-economy gains. Also, Nissan’s variable compression turbo engines—of which the 2.0-liter is one—are under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after the agency’s Office of Defects Investigation received reports of engine failure, loss of power, and metal shavings in the oil pan.\nOutside Stylistically, the new Murano is completely different from its predecessor, featuring smoother lines and a sloping roofline similar to the all-electric Nissan Ariya . Two-tone paint schemes are available, as are 21-inch wheels. A visually interesting metallic arc swoops from the A-pillar to the back of the car, giving it a look that suggests it has spent time in a wind tunnel. As if to accentuate that, its rear wiper is hidden beneath the rear spoiler, the exhaust pipe tips are concealed, and the rear license plate mount is located on the lower bumper.\nLED daytime running lights—a series of strips integrated into the grille—look similar to the ones found on some Hyundais from a few years ago. A pair of slit-like LED headlamps are separated from the Murano’s grille on either side of a shiny trim strip just above it.\nThe 2025 Murano is nearly 3 inches wider than the outgoing version, and has almost an inch and a half more ground clearance. Most of the other dimensions are the same, though, meaning interior space is unlikely to change much.\nThe Murano’s rear end features a full-width LED tail lamp assembly, hidden exhaust pipe outlets, and a hidden rear wiper.

The new Murano comes standard with dual 12.3-inch display screens, one in front of the driver and the other in line with the center console.\nThe digital display in front of the driver has several display modes that can be custom-configured to the taste of the driver. The center touchscreen handles entertainment and vehicle information. Much like the Nissan Ariya , a touch strip below the center screen handles climate controls, and the push-button gear selector leaves more space free in the center console.\nThe dash features two 12.3-inch display screens, a touch-activated strip controlling heating and ventilation functions, and a push-button gear selector.

Higher-end SL and Platinum trims come with a Bose audio system.\nA power rear hatch is standard across all trims, with a motion-sensing activator standard in the top-shelf Platinum trim. Heated, electrically adjusted front seats are standard, and heated, ventilated, and massaging front seats are optional. A heated steering wheel, a panoramic moonroof, and 64-color LED ambient lighting are also available.\nElectrically controlled, heated front seats are standard, with ventilated, massaging front seats optional. Photo: Nissan Photo: Nissan\nWhat Drives It The new 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine produces 241 hp and 260 lb.-ft. of torque, compared with the outgoing V6 engine’s 260 hp and 240 lb.-ft. of torque. The new Murano is rated to tow up to 1,500 pounds—roughly the weight of a small boat or utility trailer.\nThe base SV trim features standard front-wheel drive and optional all-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is standard on SL and Platinum trims. The new Murano also features electric power steering—largely universal now—which allows the steering assistance function that makes ProPilot possible.\nExterior dimensions on the new Murano are roughly the same as the outgoing model’s, meaning interior space is likely to be about the same. Photo: Nissan Photo: Nissan\nActive Safety and Driver Assistance Regardless of trim, the Murano comes with Nissan Safety Shield 360, Nissan’s suite of active safety features, which includes automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, lane departure warning, high beam assistance, blind spot warning, rear cross traffic alert, and rear automatic braking.\nA feature called Invisible Hood View overlays a virtual image on the hood of the Murano to give drivers a camera view in front of the car to improve frontward visibility below the hoodline. This helps to avoid “frontover” incidents and shows how close the Murano is to a curb when parking, among other uses. ProPilot is available in two versions—base, and 1.1. The base ProPilot adds steering assistance to the adaptive cruise control system, while 1.1 makes it possible to use pre-entered navigation data to adjust vehicle speed ahead of curves.",
