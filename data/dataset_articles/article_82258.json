  "text": "The [Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism & Lipid Research](https://endocrinology.wustl.edu/) in the Department of Medicine has received a $2.75 million gift through the Anita Palmer Corbin Trust to establish the Anita Palmer Corbin Diabetes Research Endowed Fund. The fund augments a spendable fund to support diabetes research in the division that was previously created by Corbin, who died in 2023. Diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 10, Corbin learned early in life to meet challenges head-on. She enjoyed a more than 20-year career at St. Louis-based Ralston Purina Co., starting as a senior accountant in 1979. After holding several positions of increasing responsibility, she was named vice president and controller in 1994, becoming the first female officer in the company. Her husband, Daniel E. Corbin Jr., said that while his wife championed many causes throughout her life, diabetes research was among her top priorities. Annual payout from the endowed fund will be used to support Type 1 diabetes research conducted by [Jeffrey Millman, PhD](https://endocrinology.wustl.edu/people/jeffrey-r-millman-phd/), professor of medicine. Millman successfully converted human stem cells into insulin-producing beta cells that were able to rapidly cure diabetes in mice. He has been honing the process to improve the survival and function of insulin-producing beta cells transplanted into patients.",
