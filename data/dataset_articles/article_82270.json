  "text": "The Learning Journey in Houston, held from September 18 to 26, 2024, was exceptionally well organized in my view. It was an informative, exciting, and incredibly enlightening experience. The program was intensive, featuring a variety of lectures from renowned experts in different fields related to space architecture. I was particularly impressed by the diversity of expertise and the dedication of the speakers in conveying their knowledge. The atmosphere was very pleasant, with frequent exchanges of opinions, spontaneous debates, and discussions where students had the opportunity to ask any questions that piqued their curiosity. The wide range of topics covered allowed us to gain various insights, from general concepts to extremely specific details. This enabled us to explore aspects of space design both in depth and breadth, reinforcing our existing knowledge and expanding it further. The lectures encompassed a broad spectrum of subjects, including a historical overview of spacecraft and missions, economic opportunities and limitations in the development of the space industry, technological achievements and their applications, as well as visions and constraints within this field. Personally, I was most captivated by the lectures addressing the psychological aspects of individuals involved in space missions. We learned many important facts based on firsthand research, which are invaluable for designing for people in such exceptionally specific conditions, always considering the psychological challenges faced by individuals in confined spaces, isolation, and with specialized tasks. I was equally impressed by lectures focusing on human dimensions, body posture, and the physical and locomotor characteristics of the human body as starting points for design. We realized how both the capabilities and limitations of the human body greatly influence design in the field of space architecture. Conversations with former astronauts left a lasting impact on me, as we heard authentic impressions from individuals who were direct participants in significant events. Additionally, witnessing the training of current astronauts in the pool was another highlight that added a unique perspective to our learning experience. It was a privilege to be among such knowledgeable and erudite students. Through intra-group collaboration and cooperation, I learned a great deal. The working atmosphere was both pleasant and vibrant. Since I did not know any of the participants before this event, I truly valued the opportunity to collaborate on a project with enthusiastic and wise colleagues. Our group project was centered on combining technical achievements with the needs of the crew during both mission preparations and the missions themselves to the Moon and Mars. We developed a concept that involved using VR glasses and interactive surfaces to simulate training in different environments while fostering a closer connection between the crew and their loved ones. This project was grounded in the synthesis of knowledge we acquired during the journey, along with ideas generated through our discussions. The group work was intense yet enjoyable and productive. I also found the work of another group, which focused on developing legislation in the field of space architecture, to be extremely useful and essential for future advancements in establishing frameworks for both science and practice. The diversity of scientific fields we were exposed to during the Learning Journey inspired me to delve deeper into an area I had only superficially known before. I was particularly excited about the junctions that could serve as logical hubs to extend my existing knowledge. This includes the design of habitats in extreme conditions, minimalist interior design of spacecraft, and zoning and separation of functions in spacecraft design. Given that urbanism is my primary interest, I was especially thrilled by projects related to habitats on Mars. Projects where futuristic visions are transformed into concrete designs have always been beacons and drivers of progress for me. Witnessing such projects and hearing about their development from the authors themselves was truly a pleasure. I believe this Learning Journey and the trip to Houston have broadened my horizons, inspired me for further learning and exploration, and provided me with the opportunity to meet exceptional people. In conclusion, being in Houston, at the authentic site of events that have changed the course of human history in space exploration (and will continue to do so), held a special and extraordinary value!
