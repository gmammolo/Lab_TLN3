[...] FBC: Firebreak is its own, fully formed thing.\n-Mike Kayatta, FBC: Firebreak Game Director\nFBC: Firebreak will launch in 2025 for Xbox Series X and S, and PC, available on Xbox Game Pass from day one.\nNext 10 Best Co-op Indie Games Teamwork makes the dream work.\nVideo Games Remedy Your changes have been saved\nEmail is sent\nEmail has already been sent\nclose Please verify your email address.\nSend confirmation email close You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.\nManage Your List Follow Followed Follow with Notifications Follow Unfollow Close",
