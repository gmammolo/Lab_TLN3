  "text": "This year Ukraine increased drone production tenfold – Ministry of Digital Transformation. Drone production in Ukraine in 2024 increased tenfold compared to 2023. The primary focus is now on improving efficiency and implementing advanced technologies. This was reported by the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine on Telegram. The Ministry of Digital Transformation, together with the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) and the Brave1 cluster, conducted research on the drone production sector. «The production capacities of the Ukrainian drone industry increased more than 10 times in 2024 compared to 2023», the report said. According to the Ministry of Digital Transformation, production capacities increased from 300,000 drones in 2023 to 4 million in 2024. The ministry noted that after the introduction of mass production, the focus shifted to improving efficiency and using the latest technologies. Experts predict that manufacturers will start to merge in the coming years due to growing competition. «We are seeing significant progress in the creation of aerial, maritime, and land drones, as well as in the development of electronic warfare systems. Among the main trends are the use of computer vision technologies, 'swarming' systems, innovations in navigation and communication», added the Ministry of Digital Transformation. It should be noted that since the start of the full-scale war, Ukraine has significantly increased the production of drones of various types. They are manufactured by both state and private enterprises. Not only copters are produced in Ukraine, but also strike, reconnaissance drones, and maritime drones. The conditions of the full-scale war, in which Russia has a significant advantage in the air, forced Ukraine to actively seek new ways of confrontation. One of these methods is the development and use of unmanned aerial vehicles that can effectively neutralize Russian drones. The Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that they are constantly improving their drones to enhance their efficiency. 'Dragon drones' have become a vivid example of such adaptation. The industrial drone manufacturer Prodrone plans to supply Ukraine with drones for demining territories.
