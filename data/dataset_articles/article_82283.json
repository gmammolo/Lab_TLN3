  "text": "Today, Remedy Entertainment has unveiled FBC: Firebreak (formerly known as Project Condor), with players joining the enigmatic Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) in a three-player cooperative first-person shooter. As the Bureau’s headquarters faces a deadly and prolonged siege by otherworldly forces, only Firebreak—its most adaptable response unit—has the skills and courage to restore order. The mid-priced FBC: Firebreak will be the first self-published game from Remedy Entertainment and is scheduled to release in 2025 for PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. FBC: Firebreak will launch day one on PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate. It also launches day one onto the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog, available for all Extra and Premium members.\nFBC: Firebreak is a session-based, multiplayer PvE stand-alone experience set within the acclaimed Control universe, delivering intense cooperative online action. Featuring a set of imaginative, highly replayable missions containing a variety of surprising twists and challenges, teamwork and strategy are at the heart of the game. Remedy will update and expand FBC: Firebreak with post-launch content, with details to be revealed later.\n“With FBC: Firebreak , our team is creating a gameplay-driven experience focused on cooperative gameplay that incorporates the strange, surreal elements our fans have come to expect,” said Mike Kayatta, Game Director of FBC: Firebreak . “At Remedy, we have been looking to leverage our expertise in action and world-building in a co-op multiplayer setting, creating something that we hope is attractive to players who have not experienced our games before.”\nFBC: Firebreak immerses players in a strange and unpredictable world where Firebreakers confront crises together within the paranatural-infested halls of the Oldest House. To fend off the otherworldly threats, players use a variety of tools and abilities. Customizable “Crisis Kits” enables players to choose their weapons, tools, and powerful paranatural augments, which are strange items with very unique powers that can alter the course of the battle.\n“ FBC: Firebreak is an opportunity to try something wholly new while fans wait for Control 2 or for those new to our games,” said Juha Vainio, Executive Producer of the Control Franchise. “Though Remedy is known for narrative-driven experiences, FBC: Firebreak is a chance for the team to flip the script and try our hand at a game that focuses on high-octane action in a multiplayer setting.”\nFind out more at https://playfirebreak.com .\nThe reveal assets for FBC: Firebreak can be found here .\nFor Remedy Entertainment press releases, please sign-up here .",
