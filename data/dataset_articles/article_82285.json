Tolkien are so vast and well crafted, that, even after more than 50 years since his passing, they're still inspiring a nearly endless set of films, TV shows, and games. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is set between The Hobbit and [The Lord of the Rings](https://gamerant.com/games-best-lotr-mods/) trilogy and follows the story of Talion, a ranger who loses his family and his own life and is later resurrected by a powerful wraith by the name of Celebrimbor.

With chained attacks, stealth exploration, and aerial strikes, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor has many elements that will allow players to have a great time as Rogues. 1 The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Making A Rogue Build Is Very Fun Your comment has not been saved - Platform(s) [PC](/tag/pc/),[PlayStation 3](/tag/ps3/),[PlayStation 4](/tag/ps4/),[PlayStation 5](/tag/ps5/),[Nintendo Switch](/tag/switch/),[Xbox 360](/tag/xbox-360/),[Xbox One](/tag/xbox-one/),[Xbox Series X](/tag/xbox-series-x/),[Xbox Series S](/tag/xbox-series-s/)- Released - November 11, 2011 - Developer(s) - Bethesda Game Studios - There are potions, armors, and skills that allow players to remain undetected by most NPCs - Players can steal valuables from chests, guards, and merchant stands Lastly, there's [The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim](https://gamerant.com/skyrim-ultima-wishlist-wanted-features/). This game not only revolutionized what players thought RPGs could do back in the day, but also set a precedent for any titles that followed it. Unlike other games on this list, Skyrim not only presents players with game mechanics that allow them to play as Rogues by using stealth, but also offers them different potions, armor, and skills to be able to walk past most enemies undetected. The lockpicking mechanics are also extremely fun, and if players spend enough skill points on them, they'll be able to open any chest in seconds. Players can also steal from merchants and pickpocket guards, which isn't always recommended, but can often be a great source of income. All in all, Skyrim presents one of the best open worlds to make a Rogue build and play as one.
