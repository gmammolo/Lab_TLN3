  "text": "Cloud Software Development Engineer and Technical Lead at Intel, Arunkumar Velayutham, has published a pioneering research paper that is set to revolutionize multi-cloud strategies for corporates. Titled “ Optimizing SASE for Low Latency and High Bandwidth Applications: Techniques for Enhancing Latency-Sensitive Systems ,” the study, available in the International Journal of Intelligent Automation and Computing, presents innovative techniques for optimizing SASE systems, directly addressing the growing demands of real-time, bandwidth-heavy applications such as video conferencing, Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and real-time data analytics.\nThis research stands as a monumental advancement in cloud engineering, particularly for corporates that rely on multi-cloud solutions to drive digital transformation. In addition to improving SASE’s security structure, Velayutham’s work makes sure that it can be modified for settings that demand strict low latency and high bandwidth—necessities that are essential for companies functioning in the rapidly evolving digital market of today.\nSignificance of the Study\nEffective networking and security solutions are becoming more and more necessary as businesses adopt real-time digital services. One well-known design that combines networking and security services into a single cloud-based platform is Secure Access Service Edge (SASE). Optimizing SASE systems to manage applications with high bandwidth and speed requirements while preserving strong security has proven to be difficult, nevertheless.\nKey Takeaways\nIn the published research, Arunkumar outlines critical strategies for improving SASE performance:\nEdge Computing and Packet Optimization: Enabling faster data processing closer to the source, which is crucial for applications requiring real-time responses. Packet Optimization Techniques: Streamlining data transmission for faster and more efficient performance. Mechanisms for Traffic Prioritization: ensuring that real-time applications, such as video conferencing and Internet of Things networks, receive the bandwidth and priority they require. AI-Driven Dynamic Path Selection: Incorporating AI into SASE architecture to automate and optimize data flow, ensuring minimal latency even under heavy bandwidth demands. Advanced SD-WAN Technologies: Innovations in multipath routing and dynamic bandwidth allocation, allowing for more efficient data distribution and load balancing. These innovations help corporates manage high-bandwidth applications without sacrificing the security and flexibility that SASE provides.\nEmpowering Corporates with Multi-Cloud Solutions\nArunkumar’s research is expected to reshape how corporates approach multi-cloud solutions, particularly those relying on latency-sensitive systems. His techniques make it possible for businesses to optimize their SASE deployments without compromising the critical security features of the architecture.\nAchievements in Cloud Engineering\nArunkumar Velayutham has been a trailblazer in cloud engineering since joining Intel in 2015. His contributions include the development of the Service Function Chaining (SFC) software module for VMware’s Antrea CNI within the Kubernetes orchestration environment. This technology links and orchestrates multiple network services, providing highly customizable data traffic pathways for cloud environments.\nHis work on VMware’s Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) environment has been instrumental in optimizing data path flows and integrating Intel’s accelerated hardware to enhance performance. Through rigorous experimentation, Arunkumar identified key opportunities for optimizing SASE performance on Intel’s 3rd and 4th generation Xeon processors. His insights were adopted by VMware, further solidifying Intel’s leadership in cloud and data center technologies.\nBroader Impact on the Tech Industry\nArunkumar’s work extends beyond academic contributions. His expertise in Service Function Chaining and cloud network architecture has led to real-world advancements, including the development of Intel’s Puma Cable Modem SoC Gateway, which enables high-speed broadband solutions for millions of households across the U.S.\nHe has also collaborated with major tech firms like VMware, helping to integrate Intel’s advanced server processors into their cloud solutions. His leadership in cloud software engineering has garnered recognition both within Intel and the broader tech community, positioning him as a thought leader in cloud and multi-cloud innovations.\nAbout Arunkumar Velayutham\nWith over a decade of experience in cloud engineering, networking, and telecommunications, Arunkumar Velayutham has led multiple high-impact projects across Intel and Motorola. As a Technical Lead at Intel, he has worked on key initiatives in cloud and data center technologies, helping major companies implement scalable and secure cloud infrastructures.\nArunkumar’s contributions to multi-cloud solutions, SASE optimization, and Service Function Chaining have been recognized globally. His work continues to advance the boundaries of cloud engineering, shaping the future of how businesses manage and secure their digital infrastructures.",
