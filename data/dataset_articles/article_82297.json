  "text": "Samsung continues to develop its line of affordable smartphones and has announced the new Galaxy A16 4G.\nHere's What We Know This model is an improved version of the Galaxy A16 5G, with a slight difference in specifications, the main one being the use of the MediaTek Helio G99 processor, which is also found in the previous A15 4G model.\nThe Galaxy A16 4G features a 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display with a refresh rate of 90Hz, which provides a bright and clear picture. The smartphone has 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal storage with the possibility of expansion. For photos and videos, there are three rear cameras: a 50 MP main camera, a 5 MP ultra-wide-angle camera and a 2 MP macro camera, as well as a 13 MP front camera.\nThanks to its 5000 mAh battery, the smartphone offers a long battery life. Support for 25W fast charging allows you to quickly replenish energy, although the charger is not included.\nThe Galaxy A16 4G is IP54-rated for dust and water resistance, supports dual-SIM, NFC and a side-mounted fingerprint scanner for easy access. It runs on Android 14 and promises 6 years of OS and security updates.\nThe model will be available in three colours: grey, green and dark blue. The official launch in Europe is expected in November, the price has not yet been announced, but it will be lower than €249 for the 5G version.\nSource: Samsung",
