  "text": "Baker Hughes, Repsol To Collaborate on AI Field Automation The companies plan to develop new artificial-intelligence-powered processes and workflows to optimize oil and gas production. Baker Hughes and Repsol announced an agreement to collaborate on the development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities for automated field production. The Leucipa automated field production platform is designed to help oil and gas operators manage production and reduce carbon emissions. Repsol has used Baker Hughes’ Leucipa platform across its operations since its introduction. The new memorandum of understanding aims to deepen that relationship, Repsol said. “Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing energy production, and Leucipa enables companies to operate more efficiently to recover more from their assets,” said Amerino Gatti, executive vice president of oilfield services and equipment at Baker Hughes. “Repsol has long been a trusted collaborator, and their support has helped Leucipa develop into the industry’s most innovative and effective digital production software. We are excited to work together to accelerate the energy industry’s digital evolution.” The companies said the collaboration aims to develop and implement AI-powered automation workflows throughout Repsol’s assets, using shared knowledge, best practices, and the technical expertise of both companies to optimize production, improve efficiency, and reduce emissions.",
