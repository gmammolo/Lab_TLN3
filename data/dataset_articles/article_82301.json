  "text": "The initial success in smartphone manufacturing is gradually permeating into other electronic components and devices, with exports of laptops almost tripling in the April-August period of this financial year.\nAccording to an analysis by the ministry of Commerce and Industry, exports of laptops to the top five markets increased to $ 102.6 million in April-August from $ 37 million in the same period of the previous year. The government’s support to the personal computer manufacturing through Production Linked Incentive (PLI) and other administrative steps have supported this surge, even though from a low base.\nThe biggest market for laptops, palmtops and handhelds is the United Arab Emirates (UAE) which bought $ 64 million worth of these devices in the first five months of the financial year. Last year during the same period exports were $ 29.7 million.\nThe second biggest buyer of computers from India, Russia increased its purchases to $ 20.4 million in April-August from just $ 4.4 million in the same period of last year.
