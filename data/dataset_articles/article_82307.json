  "text": "Forgot Username or Password Date (MENAFN- News Direct) --News Direct-- Comcast is connecting more than 2,200 previously unserved homes and businesses across Madera County, California to reliable, high speed, symmetrical Internet by expanding its Network to the region, enhancing digital infrastructure, promoting economic growth, and positioning residents and local businesses for success in an increasingly digital world. The network expansion brings residents and businesses in Madera, Chowchilla and other nearby communities, Internet, mobile, entertainment and security services from Xfinity and Comcast Business services to residents and businesses for the first time. The expansion is made possible by a nearly $17 million Federal Funding Account (FFA) grant from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and private funding by Comcast. Comcast also recently announced it has received an additional $26 million FFA grant to expand its fiber-rich network in Tulare County, which will bring broadband services to nearly 6,200 unserved locations by early 2026, continuing Comcast's efforts to help close the digital divide in the Central Valley. “I'm thankful to Comcast and the CPUC for their partnership and their continued investments within our great community to bring digital access for our students, families, seniors and businesses to thrive,” said Supervisor Jordan Wamhoff, Madera County Board of Supervisors.“These investments will help bridge the digital divide many Madera County residents experience and help enhance the overall quality of life for our rural communities.” “The CPUC's decision to award Comcast the Madera County FFA grant builds on our continued efforts in working tirelessly to close the digital divide across the Central Valley,” added David Tashjian, Regional Senior Vice President of Comcast California.“This expansion will support our ongoing network expansion efforts in the Central Valley, in cities such as Biola, Planada, Caruthers, Le Grand and Gustine.
