  "text": "Reid ENT completes 50th Inspire® Therapy Procedure\nOct. 17, 2024 -- Reid ENT has completed its 50th Inspire procedure. Inspire is an FDA-approved obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treatment option for people who cannot use Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy.\nSome 22 million\nAmericans have OSA. When left untreated, it doesn't just affect one person, but\nalso those around them. OSA can cause vehicle and workplace accidents,\nworsening mood and memory, stroke, heart attack, and other serious issues.\nCPAP is the\nmain treatment for OSA, but unfortunately many people don't see benefit from or\ncan't tolerate CPAP.\nSydney Jiang,\nMD, for Reid ENT is proud to offer Inspire as another treatment option\nfor these patients.\n\"We're excited\nto have completed the 50th Inspire procedure at Reid ENT and to be able to\noffer this to our community,\" Dr. Jiang said. \"Inspire represents a significant\nadvancement in treating sleep apnea. It's clinically proven to reduce sleep\napnea events, has a high level of patient satisfaction, and has a high therapy\nadherence.\"\nInspire works\ninside the body with a patient's natural breathing process to treat sleep\napnea. Mild stimulation opens the airway during sleep, allowing oxygen to flow\nnaturally. The patient uses a small handheld remote to turn Inspire on before\nbed and off when they wake up.\nThe Inspire\nsystem is implanted during a short, outpatient procedure. The system is placed\nunder the skin of the neck and chest through two small incisions. Most patients\nreturn home the same day and take over-the-counter pain medications to manage\npain as needed. Reid completed its first Inspire system in October 2023.\nThomas Jetmore, MD, for Reid ENT recommends the device as a treatment option for patients.\n\"Our goal is to ensure that patients with obstructive sleep apnea receive the most effective, personalized care. Inspire therapy has transformed the lives of many by improving their sleep and overall quality of life,\" Dr. Jetmore said. \"We're proud to offer this treatment option and are committed to making the entire process—from consultation to post-procedure care—as smooth and supportive as possible for our patients and their families.\"\nReid Health\nwill host a free educational webinar on Inspire at 6:30 p.m. on Nov. 13 with\nthe presentation led by Dr. Jiang.
