  "text": "Level Infinite has finally dropped Age of Empires mobile today. If you’re a fan of the classic 4X RTS series, this mobile version might interest you. The devs have apparently ‘tried to’ keep the intensity of the original PC game alive as much as possible. You can expect quick battles, fast resource gathering and non-stop action in Age of Empires mobile. Build up your military, defend against enemy waves and rally with hundreds of other players to form alliances. Like Building A Dominant Empire? Age of Empires mobile has great visuals. The battlefield scenes and cityscapes are filled with incredible detail, giving off major medieval vibes. The battles are filled with real-time action across the immersive landscapes. The world in Age of Empires mobile is alive, with seasons shifting unpredictably. You might be marching your troops through a sunny field or navigating a fog-covered battlefield where enemies could pop out of nowhere. Rainstorms slow your movement, lightning can destroy your precious siege weapons and dry spells make it harder to survive. Amidst all these, you’ll see your empire rise from nothing into something. Especially when you’re commanding historical legends like Joan of Arc, Julius Caesar and Hua Mulan. The variety of civilisations you can play with is vast. You can choose from 8 civilizations, which includes the Chinese, the Romans, the Franks, the Byzantium, the Egyptians, the British, the Japanese and the Koreans. You get up to five troops to manage at once. You also get a variety of siege weapons like trebuchets, battering rams and even airships. The huge alliance battles make Age of Empires mobile fun. Thousands of players go head-to-head, trying to capture the central structures in a city transformed into a massive battlefield. So, will you grab Age of Empires mobile? It’s free to play, so check it out on the [Google Play Store. ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.proximabeta.aoemobile&hl=en_IN)Meanwhile, you can catch a glimpse of the gameplay below.
