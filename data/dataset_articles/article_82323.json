Meet Amazon's first full-color Kindle: the Kindle Colorsoft Disclaimer: When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Ready for a splash of tech magic? The all-new [Kindle Colorsoft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?&linkCode=ll1&tag=tvguide-deals60-20&linkId=2bf565965f6f6c223e9c22d24c1f7888&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) is now available at $280 on Amazon. If you've been waiting for the Kindle to step up its game, this is the moment. This is the first Kindle to feature a color display, the ultimate game-changer for reading. Think comic books, photo books, or any title where images are key — suddenly, your favorite pages are alive in a way we've never seen from an e-reader. The new 7-inch Colorsoft screen isn't just a fun gimmick. It's designed to be easy on the eyes, offering a high-contrast, paper-like feel that enhances both images and text. And with the ability to highlight your pages in vibrant shades of yellow, blue, pink, and orange, you're not just reading — you're curating your own immersive experience. Plus, with its anti-glare surface and auto-adjusting front light, this Kindle adapts whether you're soaking up the sun or curled up for some late-night reading. Amazon has also packed in some serious longevity with this one. A single charge can last up to eight weeks, and if that's not impressive enough, you can also charge wirelessly with [a dock](https://amzn.to/3A3bU7k) (sold separately). And of course, this new Kindle is waterproof, so if you're the type who likes to read by the pool or in the bath — no worries. Your stories are safe, even when splishin' and splashin'. And in true Kindle fashion, you'll have access to a mind-blowing library. With 32 GB of storage and the [Kindle Store](https://amzn.to/3A3bU7k)'s over 15 million titles, you'll never be without something to read. If you're a binge reader, adding [Kindle Unlimited](https://amzn.to/3BL0JAS) opens up a buffet of best-sellers, so you can dive into as many books as you want. And, this isn't a tablet, either, so no social media, no notifications, just pure, uninterrupted reading. Oh, and if you're curious, Amazon has also quietly rolled out preorders for a few more devices: the [Kindle Scribe](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?&linkCode=ll1&tag=tvguide-deals60-20&linkId=10dccbc0bfe322935fddffd9a8d68c08&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) (dropping Dec. 4 for $400), the new [Kindle Paperwhite](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPJYX7P?&linkCode=ll1&tag=tvguide-deals60-20&linkId=bd2d2f8d441105b4a02c1f48c08099a5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) (from $160, available now), the regular [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNV9F72P?&linkCode=ll1&tag=tvguide-deals60-20&linkId=7c7fa78cecfd04db2f37bf93a8c6ff0f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) ($110, also available now), and the [Kindle Paperwhite Kids](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPS7ZY9?&linkCode=ll1&tag=tvguide-deals60-20&linkId=71bb3d4332ba24743b4af930926d8d71&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) ($180, available now). So whether you're going for the full-color experience or sticking with the classics, Amazon's got your reading needs covered. Get the new Kindle Colorsoft now for just $280 below.
