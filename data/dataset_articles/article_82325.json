  "text": "The next Mercedes CLE 63 ditches hybrid complications, bringing back the V8 power fans have been craving. Spy shots reveal lightly disguised prototypes of the high-performance model, including two coupes and a convertible. Mercedes may offer a second powertrain for the CLE 63 alongside the V8, possibly introducing a plug-in hybrid option. Update 10/17: Mercedes has begun peeling off the layers of disguise on its 2026 AMG CLE 63 prototypes, giving us our clearest look yet at what’s to come. Our spies have caught not one, but three different cars out in the wild—two coupes and a convertible sporting a classic cloth top. Along with a slew of fresh spy shots, we’ve also got new info to share. Scroll down for the latest updates as we piece together the puzzle of Mercedes’ next big AMG.\nPhotos Baldauf The current Mercedes-AMG C63 S may boast 671 hp and torque that could theoretically tilt the Earth’s axis, but let’s not pretend the switch from a V8 to a turbocharged four-cylinder plug-in hybrid didn’t ruffle some feathers. Purists cried foul. Apparently, it seems that AMG got the memo with the upcoming CLE 63. This time, they’re not messing around by downsizing the engine and upsetting their fanbase.\nA few months back, our spy photographers caught the new CLE 63, which could arrive as a 2026MY, doing what every proper AMG should do—lapping the Nurburgring with fury. At the time, we only had visual proof. Well, that’s changed. Several CLE 63 prototypes have now been filmed up close in Europe, and the noise doesn’t lie. There’s a thumping, unmistakable V8 growl under the hood.\nRead: Mercedes-AMG CLE 63 Could Pack A Twin-Turbo V8 Punch\nWhile specific details about the V8 in these prototypes aren’t known, it’s widely expected to be the latest version of the 4.0-liter twin-turbo unit the carmaker has been using for several years now. If you’re familiar with this engine, the soundtrack alone will take you back; it has the throaty, unapologetic rumble that the four-cylinder C63 could only dream of.\nThe existing Mercedes-AMG SL 63 rocks this same engine and produces 577 hp and 590 lb-ft (800 Nm) of torque. That may be significantly less than the 671 hp and 752 lb-ft (1,018 Nm) of the C63, but it’s still plenty of power. While we’d like to see AMG’s engineers tweak this engine for use in the CLE 63 to over 600 hp, there’s no guarantee that’ll happen.\nNevertheless, the lack of a visible charging port on any of these prototypes suggests that the V8-powered models may skip any heavy-handed hybridization. That said, a mild-hybrid system is still on the table, which would improve efficiency without diluting the V8 experience.\nA Second 4-Cylinder Powertrain Option?\nThere’s also been speculation that the new CLE 63 might come with a second powertrain option , offering a choice for buyers who can’t quite make up their minds between old-school muscle and cutting-edge tech. Rumor has it that this variant could wear the E-Performance badge, potentially packing a plug-in hybrid setup similar to the one found in the C63 S E Performance .\nIn that model, a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is paired with a rear-mounted electric motor, a 6.1 kWh battery, and a fully variable all-wheel-drive system. When everything’s working in concert, this setup churns out a ridiculous 671 hp (500 kW / 680 PS) and a mind-boggling 752 lb-ft (1,018 Nm) of torque.\nSuch an option might sound, let’s say, peculiar to purists—after all, who wants to trade V8 thunder for four-cylinder hums and electric assistance? But for those willing to embrace the hybrid future, this setup would offer a Jekyll-and-Hyde personality. It’s a fascinating, if divisive, direction for AMG.\nWhen Will It Arrive?\nAs for when we’ll actually see the new CLE 63 in all its V8 glory (and possibly, its PHEV sidekick)? That’s still a mystery. Mercedes has been playing their cards close to the chest on this one, but we suspect the reveal will come sometime in 2025. Until then, all we can do is keep an ear out for more details—or, better yet, more glorious V8 growls from those prototypes.\nPhotos Baldauf",
