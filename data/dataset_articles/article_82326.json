  "text": "Instagram and Spotify can now be linked, giving you the ability to instantly save Instagram tracks to your Spotify favorites, without ever leaving Instagram itself. The new feature began rolling out globally on October 17, and it doesn’t require a Spotify Premium subscription.\nWith millions of Instagram users uploading videos every day — many accompanied by music — there’s an argument to be made that the Meta-owned social media network has become one of the most popular ways of discovering new tunes (yeah, OK, TikTok is probably No. 1 ). Until now, it’s been easy enough to tap on a recognized track in the bottom corner of a video — taking you to the song page in Instagram so you can see related videos — but not so easy to capture that track name so you can listen to it later.\nWith this new cross-app feature, you’ll now see a small Spotify “Add” button on song pages. The first time you select it, you’ll be asked to link your Spotify account. After that, you’ll get a quick notification that the track has been added to your Liked Songs playlist. And … well, that’s it really. If you want, you can switch to the Spotify app to verify the add worked, but you don’t need to — just scroll on till you find you next new favorite track.\nThe only thing that would make this feature better would be the ability to add these Instagram discoveries to a specific Spotify playlist instead of simply throwing them in the generic Liked Songs, but still, it’s a very convenient new tool.\nRecommended Videos Spotify recently launched its AI playlist creation tool , and the uber-popular streaming music service has just given us a preview of what we can expect from the year’s upcoming Spotify Wrapped . Hint: your favorite artists may be involved.\nRelated What is Pandora?

About one-third of them are on Spotify’s Premium tier .\nEditors’ Recommendations You can now design custom Spotify playlist cover art, right in the app Spotify’s AI Playlist creation tool lands in the U.S., Canada, and beyond Tidal vs. Spotify: Which music streaming service has the features you need? ‘A much better version of Spotify’ is coming, CEO says Spotify adds new, cheaper Basic plan without the audiobooks",
