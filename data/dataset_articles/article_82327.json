  "text": "Photo: Trifonov_Evgeniy / iStock / Getty Images\nBrevard County, FL - A rare celestial event is unfolding in our night sky. Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) is currently making a once-in-a-lifetime pass by the Sun and is visible to the naked eye for a limited time.\nWhile the comet was initially visible in the morning sky, its path has brought it to the evening sky, making it observable in the west shortly after sunset.\nDespite its recent social media buzz, many are still unsure how to spot this celestial wonder.\nTo spot the comet, look to the western sky just after sunset for the next few nights.\nEnsure you have a clear view of the western horizon and allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness.\nWhile a telescope or expensive equipment is not necessary, strong eyesight is recommended. However, simple sporting binoculars can aid in viewing the comet and its faint tail.\nFor those with smartphones, using the night shot setting on your camera can help capture the comet.\nThis setting takes a longer exposure, gathering more light and revealing details not visible to the naked eye.\nThe comet will be visible in the western sky at the following times:\nTonight (Thursday): 7:07 PM Friday: 7:21 PM Saturday: 7:20 PM Sunday: 7:19 PM Monday: 7:18 PM As the comet continues its journey away from the Sun, it will become dimmer each night. Therefore, now is the ideal time to observe this extraordinary celestial event before it fades from our view.",
