  "text": "Boston Dynamics y Toyota Research Institute ( TRI ) announced a new alliance to advance the development of humanoid robots by incorporating advanced artificial intelligence and cutting-edge robotic platforms. The main objective of this collaboration is to accelerate progress in general-purpose robotics and offer innovative solutions that improve people’s lives in everyday and industrial activities.\nThe technology partnership of Boston Dynamics and Toyota Research Institute This partnership lies in uniting the robot Atlas of Boston Dynamics known for its ability to perform complex tasks with extreme mobility, with large-scale behavioral models ( LBM ) from TRI, designed to improve the physical intelligence of robots. The integration of these technologies would allow explore new capabilities in humanoid robots especially in bimanual manipulation and the performance of complex physical tasks.\nRobert Playter, CEO de Boston Dynamics highlighted the impact of this alliance: “ We are excited to work together with TRI to tackle the most complex challenges in robotics. Our Atlas robot , together with TRI’s artificial intelligence, will allow us to develop new skills in robots that could revolutionize several sectors ”.\nFor his part, Gill Pratt, executive director of Toyota Research Institute highlighted the importance of implementing cutting-edge AI in highly advanced robots: “ We are at a key moment where artificial intelligence and robotics converge. Our collaboration with Boston Dynamics will allow us to amplify human capacity, improving both safety and quality of life through advanced automation ”.\nBoth companies have led the field of robotics in their respective areas. Boston Dynamics is recognized for its innovative Atlas humanoid platform, which has been developed to perform tasks that imitate human behavior with precision and efficiency. On the other hand, TRI has advanced applied AI, especially in multitasking model creation conditioned by vision and language, which allow robots to perform complex manipulations.\nThe project will focus on collecting data from the physical tasks performed by robots, to then train more advanced behavioral models. These models will be used to equip the humanoid robots with robust and agile abilities ready to be deployed in industrial and everyday environments.\nThis alliance represents an important step in the future of humanoid robotics, with implications for multiple industries, from manufacturing to healthcare. With the merger of Boston Dynamics and TRI, humanoid robots are expected to be able to perform tasks that previously seemed beyond the reach of machines, providing practical and effective solutions to improve human life.\nFollow us on social media and don’t miss any of our posts!\nYouTube LinkedIn Facebook Instagram X\nFuente: Toyota\nFoto: Boston Dynamics",
