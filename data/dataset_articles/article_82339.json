  "text": "Microsoft is significantly improving its support for passkeys within Windows 11 soon, as the new Windows Hello experience will let you choose the way you want to save user folders, and even sync with a Microsoft account or store them through 1Password, Bitwarden, or other package providers.\nA password manager API and a new third-party package mean developers can connect directly to Windows 11. The same passkey from a mobile phone can also be used to authenticate on a PC.\nMicrosoft is also rapidly redesigning the Windows Hello, including the ability to set up sync codes to your Microsoft account or save them elsewhere.\nOnce you’re set up for the first time, you can use your face, fingerprint, or PIN to authenticate with a passkey across multiple Windows 11 devices.\nNearby properties\nWindows Insiders will be able to access these new passkey features first in the coming months, and it will take some time until all Windows 11 users will be able to experience these new packages .\nMicrosoft plans to share more details about its improved support for passkeys during Windows security sessions at the Authenticate 2024 conference next week.",
