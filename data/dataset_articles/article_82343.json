  "text": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Vyalev™ (foscarbidopa/ foslevodopa) for the treatment of motor fluctuations in adults with advanced Parkinson disease (PD). Vyalev combines foscarbidopa, a prodrug of carbidopa, and foslevodopa, a prodrug of levodopa, into a solution for continuous subcutaneous (SC) 24-hour infusion. The approval was supported by data from the pivotal phase 3 M15-736 study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: [NCT04380142](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04380142?term=NCT04380142&rank=1)), as well as long-term safety and efficacy data from a 52-week, open-label phase 3 study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: [NCT03781167](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03781167)). M15-736 was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial that compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SC foscarbidopa/foslevodopa infusion to oral immediate-release (IR) carbidopa/levodopa in patients with advanced PD. Study participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive continuous SC infusion of foscarbidopa/foslevodopa and oral placebo capsules (n=74) or oral IR levodopa/carbidopa and continuous SC infusion of placebo solution (n=67). The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 12 in “on” time without troublesome dyskinesia, assessed by PD diary. Findings showed treatment with foscarbidopa/foslevodopa demonstrated statistically significant improvements from baseline in “on” time without troublesome dyskinesia compared with oral IR levodopa/carbidopa after 12 weeks (2.72 hours vs 0.97 hours, respectively; P =.0083). Additionally, there was a significant reduction in “off” time of -2.75 hours in the foscarbidopa/foslevodopa group compared with -0.96 hours in the oral IR levodopa/carbidopa group at week 12 (P =.0054). The most common adverse reactions reported with foscarbidopa/foslevodopa were infusion/catheter site reactions and infections, hallucinations, and dyskinesia. Vyalev is supplied as 120mg/2400mg of foscarbidopa/foslevodopa per 10mL solution in a single-dose vial. The Vyafuser pump used to administer Vyalev is provided separately. Patients should be trained on the proper use of Vyalev and the delivery system before starting therapy.
