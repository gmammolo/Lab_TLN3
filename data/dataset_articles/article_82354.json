The two Japanese-derived trucks sold a combined 38,205 copies this year so far, making them far less successful than the monocoque American midsize lifestyle truck. For Q3 alone, Toyota confirms 4,518 unit sales of the Tacoma Hybrid and 4,122 copies of the Tundra Hybrid. Ford highlights that its hybrid truck duo constitutes 77 percent of the hybrid truck marketshare for Q3. Ford's hybrid option for the Maverick was a far more popular option, as the EcoBoost turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder model only managed to rake in 11,740 sales within the same timeframe.\nPros Decent towing capacity for its class Sporty ride Favorable fuel consumption returns Cons Poor comfort levels Cheap-feeling interior Minimal key standard features Ford confirms that it has sold 108,996 Mavericks this year so far, with the bulk of these being the Hybrid derivative, making it one of the brand's most successful products. The Maverick has only been available on the market for a few years, but its success highlights how so many consumers value the versatility of a monocoque compact truck that fits well into urban areas with some level of durability while lightly off-roading .\nRelated Here's How Much A Fully Loaded Ford Maverick Hybrid Costs The 2025 Ford Maverick is loaded to the gills, but if you want to personalize it even further, here's how much it would cost you.\nHow Much A 2024 Ford Maverick Hybrid Costs\nFord For 2024, the Ford Maverick range currently starts at $25,670 for the base XL trim. Options include the exclusive $495 metallic paint shades, Ford's Co-Pilot360 package for $650, a $1,200 tonneau rollup box cover, or a folding one for $1,180. You can also get bed crossbars for $680 and a soft folding cover for $590. Beyond this, there are a host of accessories and pieces of equipment that you can specify based on your particular needs.\nTrim Level\nBase Price\nXL\n$25,670\nXLT\n$30,460\nLariat\n$34,240\nThe XLT is a more lifestyle-oriented derivative, boasting a $30,460 starting price. This benefits from more color options and alloy wheels. The Luxury Package adds a host of exclusive features for $2,275. You can also black-out the exterior trimmings for $1,645. The Lariat sits at the top of the range at $34,240, but it includes the Luxury Package and CoPilot as standard. You also get access to a few more optional extras.\nAdd TopSpeed to your Google News feed.\nFollow On Google News\nFord Maverick Consumption And Range Estimates\nFord As per the EPA, the Ford Maverick Hybrid returns a 42/33/37 MPG consumption estimate on the city/highway/combined cycle. Boasting a 13.8-gallon tank and 1.1 kWh lithium-ion battery, you can also expect it to cover a fairly impressive 511 miles on a single tank. The EPA estimates that you'll save up to $2,000 on fuel over five years, while spending $1,300 on gasoline every year. This equates to $2.15 for every 25 miles you drive. It will cost you $44 to fill the tank.\nCity\nHighway\nCombined\nAnnual Fuel Cost (est)\n2.0L EcoBoost\n23 MPG\n30 MPG\n26 MPG\n$1,850\n2.5L Hybrid\n42 MPG\n33 MPG\n37 MPG\n$1,300\nFor reference, the EcoBoost is the entry-level powertrain, but it does benefit from an optional all-wheel drive system. The EPA estimates the front-wheel drive variant will return a 23/30/26 MPG and cover 429 miles on a single tank, measuring 16.5 gallons. With this model, you're likely to spend $1,850 on fuel every year, equating to $750 worth of savings over five years. It'll cost you $3.06 to drive 25 miles and $52 to fill up the tank.\nReview 2024 Ford Maverick Lariat FWD Hybrid - The Compact Pickup That Thinks It's A Car Responsive, comfortable and quiet, the 2024 Ford Maverick Lariat FWD Hybrid compact pickup behaves more like a car than a truck.\n3 The Ford Maverick Hybrid Drivetrain Pushes Out 191 Horsepower\nFord The Ford Maverick Hybrid features the brand's naturally aspirated 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with one permanent-magnet motor. This generates a combined 191 horsepower and 155 pound-feet to the front wheels via a direct-drive eCVT system. Ford is finally adding an all-wheel drive option to the 2025 model year. As per the brand's claims, you can expect the Maverick Hybrid to cover a 0-60 MPH sprint in 8.0 seconds and hit a 110 MPH top speed. If you fit the optional tow package, you get access to a 4,000-pound towing capacity.\nPerformance Specifications Price $25,670 Powertrain 2.5-Liter Four-Cylinder And One Permanent-Magnet Motor Horsepower 191 HP Torque 155 LB-FT Transmission Direct-Drive eCVT Driveline Front-Wheel Drive Battery 1.1 kWh Range 511 Miles Fuel Economy 37 MPG 0-60 MPH 8.0 Seconds Top Speed 110 MPH Towing Capacity 4,000 Pounds According to Consumer Reports , Ford's hybrid mid-size truck option benefits from a 77/100 overall score, together with an 82/100 road test score and a 60/100 predicted reliability score. It also indicates that you'll experience a 5/5 owner satisfaction experience. The review highlights that the Maverick Hybrid excels at offering good fuel economy from the hybrid system, together with competent ride and handling characteristics. It does get some criticism for its poor cabin quality.\nThe NHTSA does not issue any recalls for the 2024 Maverick Hybrid, but the non-HEV variation currently has seven recalls attached to it , which include problems with the rearview camera, windshield wiper motor, software glitches, and taillights. We assume that these problems do affect the hybrid model, considering they all come off the same production line.\nWhy The Ford Maverick Hybrid's Success Will Continue In 2025\nFord The 2025 Ford Maverick will continue to rise to success thanks to several thoughtful changes that appeal to this year's market trends. As of right now, the 2.5-liter hybrid powertrain is an optionally available powertrain, with the 2.0-liter EcoBoost engine being the standard offering. For 2025, the brand has decided to swap this around in order to make the hybrid a more accessible option. This is a logical move considering a bulk of the sales already go to the hybrid derivative.\nKey Changes For The 2025 Ford Maverick Hybrid The 2025 Ford Maverick offers a new hybrid all-wheel drive option for improved traction and versatility. A 13.2-inch touchscreen with the updated Sync 4 system is now standard, including wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Maverick adds a sport-focused Lobo trim with lowered suspension, performance-tuned handling, and exclusive design elements. Off-road enthusiasts can opt for the enhanced Tremor model with trail capabilities. A fresh front-end design includes redesigned headlights and grille for a modern look. New exterior color options, including Eruption Green and Velocity Blue, expand customization. Ford justifies this decision by clarifying that the hybrid offers sufficient performance and fuel economy in relation to the EcoBoost. The addition of an optional all-wheel drive system for the Hybrid further increases its appeal and will likely be a big motivator for many potential buyers to opt for the hybrid Maverick. For 2025, Ford is also adding the Tremor package as a unique trim level for those wanting a more off-road aesthetic. It will also include the Trail Control system for enhanced traction on loose surfaces. The entire range will benefit from more in-depth towing functions via an optional package.\nFord Toyota Ford Maverick Your changes have been saved\nEmail is sent\nEmail has already been sent\nclose Please verify your email address.\nSend confirmation email close You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.\nManage Your List Follow Followed Follow with Notifications Follow Unfollow Close",
