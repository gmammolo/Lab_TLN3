  "text": "With the demand for eco-friendly materials on the rise, aluminum with its sustainable properties has become the go-to material in construction. It can be used in bridges, transportation systems, buildings, and almost anything with the word construction in it.\nBut why is that? What makes aluminum so unique?\nFor starters, 90% of all aluminum used in construction is recycled and 95% less energy is used to recycle it when compared to its primary extraction methods. It also has exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and superior thermal properties making it an ideal choice for sustainable construction.\nWhy is Aluminum Sustainable?\nSeveral qualities make aluminum an eco-friendly construction material. For instance, it can be recycled without any loss in quality, requiring 95% less energy than primary production, which substantially reduces carbon emissions compared to iron and other metals.\nWhat also adds to its sustainability are its properties such as durability and ease of use which makes it suitable for almost all construction activities, from buildings to bridges.\nProperties That Make Aluminum Sustainable Wide Choice Of Alloys Aluminum is a soft metal and is often alloyed with copper, manganese, magnesium, zinc, etc. This provides it with the desired physical and mechanical properties to withstand strong loads and makes it suitable for different construction applications.\nThe alloy mix can be further varied to enhance different properties that make it more viable for unique applications and support various shapes.\nDesign Flexibility Flexibility in construction design is critical and aluminum through the extrusion process offers an almost infinite range of forms and sections. This helps to integrate multiple functions within the same profile and also makes it easy to saw, drill, rivet, and screw.\nAluminum composite panels can be manufactured flat, curved, shaped into cassettes, or sandwiched with other materials.\nLong Service Life & Low Maintenance For a construction material to be eco-friendly and sustainable, it has to have a long service life and be immune to harmful UV rays, therefore ensuring optimal performance.\nAluminum alloys are composed in such a way that they are weatherproof, corrosion resistant, and also need minimum maintenance. Apart from enhancing the aesthetic appeal, aluminum does not require any paint or any other form of heavy upkeep.\nMultiple Surface Finishes Aluminum surfaces can be painted, anodized, or powder coated in any color without compromising its durability and an easy-to-clean surface. You can get it in multiple finishes making it suitable for residential, commercial, or industrial applications.\nHigh Strength-to-Weight Ratio Aluminum alloys have a high strength-to-weight ratio, which can meet many desired performance specifications while minimizing the dead load on the building’s supporting structure.\nThis is a major advantage, especially in cladding and roofing applications. Because of its high strength, aluminum windows, doors, and curtain wall frames can be very narrow, thus maximizing the glazed surface and solar gains for home or office buildings.\nFire Safety Aluminum , as a metal is a fire-resistant material, and therefore has been classified as a non-combustible construction material (European Fire Class A1).\nHowever, aluminum alloys do melt at around 650°C but do not release any harmful gasses. For this reason, external walls are increasingly being made of thin aluminum cladding panels.\nA recent study of the alloys used in making aluminum panels indicates that their surface treatments eg. coating or anodizing, as well as other materials used, are all neutral emitting zero harmful gasses.\nHeat Conductivity Aluminum ’s heat conduction is a major advantage when it comes to heat exchangers used in energy-efficient ventilation systems or solar thermal heat collectors.\nHowever, it can be a disadvantage in windows and facades. This drawback can be overcome by using appropriate profiles and thermal breaks made from low-conductivity material.\nFinal Thoughts Aluminum is one of the most versatile and eco-friendly materials available for construction, and in the future, we will only see more of it being used in the construction industry. It has excellent recycling capabilities, with no loss in the quality of recycled material produced.\nAdditionally, its physical and mechanical properties such as high strength to weight ratio, corrosion-free nature, and fireproofing make it an ideal material to be used in buildings, bridges, window panels, and other construction applications.",
