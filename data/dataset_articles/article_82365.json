Co-founders Sam Altman and Alex Blania hosted this exclusive gathering where they showcased innovative technologies poised to enhance user experiences in a rapidly changing digital landscape. As artificial intelligence evolves, these advancements empower individuals while fostering systems that prioritize collective benefits. Revolutionary Updates Unveiled The event launched several key updates that promise to redefine the World Network experience. Let’s take a closer look at what was disclosed. Next-Generation Orb: Redefining Human Verifications One of the standout presentations featured the unveiling of the latest Orb device, which amplifies the efficiency and scalability of World ID verifications. This revolutionary gadget, utilizing the new NVIDIA Jetson chipset, offers nearly five times the AI capabilities of its predecessor. Remarkably, its design simplifies the verification process with a 30 percent reduction in components while incorporating a removable external SD card to facilitate complete auditability. This next-generation Orb advances verification models, including flagship locations, on-demand devices, and self-service kiosks, thereby speeding up the global deployment of human verification processes. Introducing World ID 3.0 for Enhanced Privacy The launch of World ID 3.0 marks a significant milestone in user credentialing. The new features allow individuals to store details from their NFC-enabled passports on their devices securely. This facilitates age, nationality, or ownership verification without exposing full identities. Moreover, World ID 3.0 incorporates Advanced Multiparty Computation (AMPC) and the newly developed World ID Deep Face, tools designed to bolster online security and tackle fraudulent activities in digital interactions. The All-New World App 3.0 World Network introduced the revamped World App 3.0, a platform engineered to grow alongside the network's expanse. Supporting Mini Apps, this redesign allows third-party developers to integrate seamlessly with World ID, Wallet, and Contacts, all while preserving user anonymity. With additional wallet functionalities like Vault and World Pay, the app enhances both utility and security for its users. Official Launch of the World Chain Mainnet Amongst the most anticipated announcements was the launch of the World Chain mainnet. The transition of over 15 million World ID holders and app users signifies a major milestone. World Chain is unique as it is the first blockchain dedicated to prioritizing human activity and transaction efficiency. Supported by top-tier blockchain services such as Optimism and Uniswap, this initiative promises robust infrastructural support for a global user base. Worldcoin Transitions to World Network The rebranding of Worldcoin to World Network signifies a strategic shift reflecting the project's ambitious vision to drive progress for humanity. This evolution emphasizes three core components: World Chain, World ID, and World Network itself—a network engineered to ensure that human needs remain central in AI development. The Vision and Mission of World Network World Network, founded by thought leaders such as Sam Altman, Alex Blania, and Max Novendstern, aspires to create the most inclusive identity and financial public utility accessible to all. Aiming to foster a global alliance of developers, economists, and technologists, this initiative is spearheaded by the World Foundation. Their overarching goal is to drive participation and accessibility in economic systems worldwide. About Tools for Humanity Another pivotal player in this landscape is Tools for Humanity (TFH), a global technology entity committed to nurturing a fair economic system. TFH paved the way for World Network's initial development and continues to manage the World App independently from the World Foundation. The organization envisions crafting essential tools that will support the World Network's mission as it grows, spearheading advancements that align with socio-economic fairness.
