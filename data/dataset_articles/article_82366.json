  "text": "What You Should Know:\n– Google Research is taking a significant step towards reducing preventable blindness by expanding access to its AI-powered diabetic retinopathy screening model in India and Thailand.\n– This initiative aims to address the growing need for accessible and efficient screening in regions with limited access to eye care specialists.\nThe Growing Threat of Diabetic Retinopathy\nDiabetes is a global health concern, with an estimated 537 million adults living with the condition worldwide. Diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness, affects nearly half of those with diabetes. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for preserving vision, but many individuals lack access to regular screenings.\nAI as a Solution\nGoogle Research has developed an AI model that can accurately detect diabetic retinopathy. This model has already supported over 600,000 screenings in clinics around the world. To further expand its reach and impact, Google is now licensing its model to partners in India and Thailand, two countries with a significant shortage of eye care specialists.\nPartnering for Population-Scale Impact\nGoogle is collaborating with several healthcare providers and health-tech partners to bring its AI model to resource-constrained communities:\nForus Health: A leading provider of comprehensive eye care solutions in India. AuroLab: A leading diagnostics company in India. Perceptra: A Thai health tech company focused on AI-powered solutions for healthcare. These partners will work towards securing local regulatory approvals and integrating the AI model into clinical care systems. Over the next 10 years, they aim to deliver a combined 6 million AI-supported screenings at no cost to patients.\nThai Ministry of Public Health Collaboration\nGoogle is also collaborating with the Thai Ministry of Public Health’s Department of Medical Services (DMS) to implement the AI model in public sector hospitals. This collaboration will help expand access to diabetic retinopathy screening and improve patient outcomes across Thailand.\n“It seems to be just yesterday when Rajavithi Hospital and Google started collaborating on research for bringing AI to Thailand’s national diabetic retinopathy screening programs,” said Dr. Paisan Ruamviboonsuk, Retinal Specialist and Clinical Professor of Ophthalmology, Rajavithi Hospital in Thailand. “Seven years later, we’re grateful to bring this technology to Thai patients with diabetes but also Thailand’s public health system as a whole.”",
