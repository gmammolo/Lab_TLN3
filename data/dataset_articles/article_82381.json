  "text": "[Press Releases](https://www.advamed.org/industry-updates/news/) AdvaMed Concludes Record-breaking MedTech Conference 2024 Washington, D.C. – AdvaMed, the MedTech Association, just concluded its largest annual MedTech Conference to date, with a record-breaking 4,350 attendees, representing 1,926 companies from 48 countries. This year’s conference, the first to be held internationally, highlighted Canada’s role as a medtech leader and a key life sciences collaborator with the United States and global partners. “Everywhere I went, people were energetic and enthusiastic about the role of medtech in saving and improving lives,” said Scott Whitaker, AdvaMed president and CEO. “The MedTech Conference 2024 was not only the highest attended in AdvaMed history, it also was comprehensive in the topics covered, diverse in the types of companies and medtech represented, full of hands-on demonstrations, and packed with insights about how to do business locally and globally to help as many patients as possible enjoy good health. Medtech Canada was an outstanding partner in helping AdvaMed execute this successful event. We’re grateful to continue working together to better serve patients.” Kevin Lobo, Chairman and CEO of Stryker, an AdvaMed Board member, and co-chair of The MedTech Conference, played a critical role in executing this record-breaking event. As a dual citizen of Canada and the United States, Lobo has been a leader in the medtech industry across both countries, bringing unique insights and leadership to the conference. Joining him as co-chair, James Brodie, General Manager of Johnson & Johnson MedTech, leads its group of medical technology companies in Canada, further strengthening the medtech sector in the country. Brodie serves as the Chair of the Board of Directors of MedTech Canada. The event was 25% larger than any previous conference, featuring the largest representation of international delegations to date, including a strong Canadian contingent.
