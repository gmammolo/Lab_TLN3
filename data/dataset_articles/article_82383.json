  "text": "Science Applications International Corp. and Wind River will expand their partnership with the aim of developing advanced technologies for the government and the U.S. Army .\nSAIC said Tuesday the collaboration will combine various innovations, accelerate the development process and enhance system capabilities to deliver advanced technologies that the Army, government entities and independent agencies can utilize for their evolving needs.\nThe two companies will work together on integrating products and creating joint go-to-market strategies for Wind River’s software offerings. This includes DevSecOps, digital engineering, digital twins, Linux, cloud-based command and control operations, safety certifiable products and certification services.\nIn addition, the expanded partnership will bolster mission-critical systems across various applications, including lifecycle systems and engineering support.\nThe partnership between SAIC and Wind River goes back more than 10 years. The two previously worked together in supporting embedded software for the Army at Redstone Arsenal.\nJosh Jackson , executive vice president and manager of the Army business group at SAIC and a 2024 Wash100 Award winner, stated that the expanded partnership allows them to accelerate the integration of complex weapons systems. “Together, we are poised to leverage a suite of cloud-based digital engineering tools purposely designed to address the requirements in building the Army of 2030.”",
