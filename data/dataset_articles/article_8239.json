  "text": "GAINESVILLE, Fla. (WCJB) - Storms are brewing as hurricane season kicked off earlier this month. Some organizations are using this time to prepare for what’s to come. Marion Senior Services has started its food drive to keep seniors fed and safe during the season. They usually have food items prepared for seniors, but they’re trying to get a headstart on what’s to come in the following months. “We find that seniors are left alone and without food,” said Tamara Grant-Powell, Finance Director. “And knowing that during the hurricane season, we usually have loss of power, energy, things like that. We wanted to make sure that our seniors are equipped and have the food on hand needed.” The Director of Human Services says they sometimes meet senior citizens when it’s almost too late. “Often times we find individuals that are at a point of crisis so having food on hand to help and serve an immediate need is very helpful.” said Briana Kelley. Marion Senior Services also provides seniors with emergency kits that consist of a bucket, flashlights, sanitary wipes, and other items that can last for at least a week. The food drive will last throughout the entirety of hurricane season. For more information on the drive, click here . Click here to subscribe to our newsletter. Copyright 2024 WCJB.
