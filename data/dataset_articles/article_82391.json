  "text": "Stakeholders have advocated for a safe and inclusive digital ecosystem for everyone, especially vulnerable persons. This was the crux of the conversation at the 2024 online safety forum organised by Techsocietal, a non-governmental organisation (NGO). The theme of the forum, which took place in Lagos, was ‘Connected and protected: Ensuring safe digital access for all’. NGOs championing digital space safety, representatives of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and Meta attended the event. Advertisement Speaking during the panel session on online access and safety, Emmanuel Edet, the acting director of regulations and compliance at NITDA, said the government is worried about what people do with digital access. Edet said the government always seeks to provide safety in the digital space for internet users. He added that NITDA has been providing public enlightenment concerning digital space safety. Advertisement “I will start by saying that digital access is not a problem in Nigeria. The problem is meaningful digital access,” Edet said. “What is the quality of access? Beyond that access, what do people do with the kind of access that they have? “The access actually provides the kind of safety that people require. “We need to have a better conversation with the tech community. Let’s understand what our position in terms of online safety is. It is not an imported position but our local position.” Advertisement Also speaking, Juliet Ohahuru-Obiora, the programme director at the Action Against Child Sexual Abuse Initiative (ACSAI), said the internet exposes young people to many dangers. Ohahuru-Obiora noted that there is a need to put safety measures in place to protect the young population. On his part, Adeboye Adegoke, a senior programme manager at Paradigm Initiative, said there must be a clamour for digital literacy campaigns, in addition to creating access. Adegoke said some people believe and accept every piece of information they see on social media without any form of verification, adding that digital literacy is very important. Advertisement “It is not two competing issues to argue that we should protect rights while addressing safety issues online. It is not a conflict,” he said. “Let’s stop presenting the argument that once we protect rights, people are going to be unsafe, or when we want to keep people safe, we have to deprive people of their rights. We can ensure rights while also ensuring safety.” Advertisement Sylvia Musalagani, head of safety policy, Africa, Middle East, and Turkey at Meta, who joined the event virtually, said the organisation is committed to building products that consider the safety of users. Musalagani said Meta has been working with their local partners to enable the tech company to understand the “contexts of content that play out” on their platforms for safer engagement. Advertisement On her part, Chioma Agwuegbo, executive director of TechHer, said big tech companies have a duty of care to users, especially vulnerable people, as it relates to safety. Agwuegbo said big tech companies must welcome criticism from stakeholders on the safety of their products, adding that “true partnership is accountability and co-creation”. Advertisement Speaking on the sidelines of the event, Temitope Ogundipe, executive director of Techsocietal, said there is a need for strong partnerships among stakeholders to achieve safe access to the digital space for everyone. Ogundipe urged parents to actively monitor the mobile devices of their children. Add a comment",
