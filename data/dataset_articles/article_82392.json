REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo\n18 Oct 2024 04:06AM (Updated: 18 Oct 2024 12:23PM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn LOS ANGELES :Netflix picked up 5.1 million streaming subscribers in the third quarter, topping Wall Street estimates by more than 1 million, and said it expected higher customer growth around the holidays when Korean drama \"Squid Game\" returns.\nShares of Netflix rose 4.8 per cent in after-hours trading on Thursday following the earnings report. The shares have gained about 47 per cent so far this year.\nAs the pace of subscriber addition slows, Netflix has been trying to shift investor attention away from sign-ups to metrics including revenue growth and profit margins. It will stop reporting subscriber data from next year, and is touting growth in its ad-supported plans.\nThe streaming giant said on Thursday its ad-supported service accounted for more than 50 per cent of signups in the third quarter in countries where it was available.\nWall Street had expected Netflix to bring in 4 million subscribers from July through September, according to analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG. New programming during the period included murder mystery \"The Perfect Couple\" and romantic comedy \"Nobody Wants This.\"\nNetflix earned $5.40 per share in the quarter, above the consensus forecast of $5.12. Operating margin hit 30 per cent in the quarter, compared with 22 per cent a year earlier.\nRevenue rose to $9.825 billion, just ahead of the $9.769 billion consensus forecast.\n\"On the surface, Netflix is trending in all the right directions,\" said Forrester analyst Mike Proulx. \"Financially, revenue and operating margins continue to increase and expenses are down.\"\nBut while the customer additions outpaced forecasts, they were below the 8.76 million that Netflix picked up in the year-ago quarter.\n\"A steep decline in net new subscribers is what’s concerning. While there’s room for net subscriber growth internationally, in the U.S. things are getting tapped out,\" Proulx said.\nNetflix projected its customer additions for the last three months of the year - traditionally a strong period around the holidays - would outpace the September quarter, though it did not provide a number. The second season of Korean drama \"Squid Game\" is scheduled for release in late December.\n\"We're feeling really good about the business,\" Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a post-earnings video. \"We had a plan to re-accelerate the business, and we delivered on that plan.\"\n'CRAWL, WALK, RUN'\nThe company said its programming volume had picked up following disruptions from last year's Hollywood strikes. Engagement, the time spent watching Netflix, averaged two hours per day per member.\nWhile Netflix has reported subscriber gains in its ad-supported tier, it does not expect advertising to become a primary growth driver until 2026.\n\"They consistently remind us of crawl, walk, run and I think, yeah, it's still definitely the beginning,\" said Magalie Grossheim, senior equity research analyst at M Science. \"In our data, we continue to see that the selection rate for the ad-supported plan is accelerating in a lot of the mature markets.\"\nPart of the plan centers around live events including sports, a big draw for advertisers. In November, Netflix will stream a fight between YouTube star Jake Paul and Mike Tyson, followed by two National Football League games on Christmas Day.\nThe company also plans to increase prices in Spain and Italy on Friday. Earlier this month, it raised prices in a few European markets and in Japan.\nSarandos has rejected the idea of adding Netflix to a discounted bundle with other streaming services such as Walt Disney and Warner Bros Discovery.\n\"What we're focused on is adding more and more value to this package,\" Sarandos said on Thursday, calling this a \"comfortable model\" for traditional media companies.\nSource: Reuters Sign up for our newsletters Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox\nSubscribe here Get the CNA app Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories\nDownload here Get WhatsApp alerts\nJoin our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app\nJoin here Advertisement Also worth reading Content is loading...
