Warner. “I’ve been proud to work closely with the Department of Justice on the launch of these resources as we continue to honor Ashanti’s legacy and save lives.”Watch: FCC approves 'Missing and Endangered Persons' alert codeChampioned by Warner, the Ashanti Alert Act became law in 2018 after Virginia Beach woman Ashanti Billie, 19, was abducted from Norfolk and found dead in North Carolina days later in 2017.Billie was too old to receive an AMBER alert and too young for a senior alert.Back in August, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the \\\"Missing and Endangered Persons’ Emergency Alert System Code.\\\" The code was help find those outside the criteria of an AMBER alert.Watch: Lawmaker reflects on early progress of CODI Alert for missing childrenFCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel told News 3 she hopes the code will \\\"galvanize public attention to missing and endangered people of all ages who do not qualify for AMBER Alerts, including those who meet the criteria for Ashanti Alerts.\\\"",
