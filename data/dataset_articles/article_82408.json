Tonight’s supermoon will be the biggest and brightest full moon of the year.\nReferred to as the Hunter’s Moon, the full moon is set to dazzle the autumn skies at sunset. The common phenomenon has started a social media frenzy, with many in awe of how close the moon has appeared over the past few days.\nOn Thursday, the moon is expected to peak at its fullest, and a Toronto scientist gives insight on the spatial spectacle.\nWHAT IS A SUPERMOON? Humber Polytechnic educational developer and planetary scientist, Dr. Sara Mazrouei, says that a supermoon occurs when a full moon is at its closest point to Earth during its orbit. At its closest, the moon appears to be around 14 per cent larger in the sky.\n“The moon’s orbit around the Earth is not a perfect circle, it’s an ellipse. So, at some points, it comes a little bit closer to the earth, and at some point it’s a little bit further,” Mazrouei explained to Now Toronto on Thursday.\n“But when it comes at its closest to the Earth, it’s called the point of perigee, and if that happens to be when the moon is also at a full moon, we call that a supermoon.”\nMazrouei says this Hunter’s Moon is special compared to previous years, as the last time the moon was recorded to be as bright as it will be was 17 years ago.\nHOW COMMON IS THE SUPERMOON? Though the interest in supermoons seems to be becoming more popular, Mazrouei says the phenomenon is quite common. In fact, this supermoon marks the third of four consecutive supermoons this year, she says. However, she notes that each one once served historical purposes.\n“They do happen multiple times a year, and each one has a different significance,” she said.\n“The last one we had was the Harvest Moon, which happens around harvest time. This one is called Hunter’s Moon, because in the older times it was said to provide a little bit more light for hunting and getting ready for the winter. So, it’s sort of signifying different times of the year.”\nThe next one after Thursday is expected on November 15, and is referred to as the Beaver Supermoon. There are different interpretations for the meaning of the name; one is that mid-fall was the time for Indigenous tribes to set beaver traps before the swamps freeze to ensure a supply of warm winter furs, according to NASA . Another interpretation suggests that the name Beaver Moon came from how active the beavers are during the season as they prepare for winter.\n WHAT TIME WILL THE SUPERMOON BE SEEN? Mazrouei says the moon actually peaked at its fullness at 7:26 a.m. on Thursday. But non-early risers still have a chance to catch it at sunset, or moonrise, tonight. She encourages viewers to look toward the horizon at around 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time.",
