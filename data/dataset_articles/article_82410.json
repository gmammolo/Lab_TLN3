MileageWise is excited to unveil this latest benefit for both current and new app users, specifically designed to enhance the user experience and better meet the needs of small business owners. Gary Csizmadia, Head of Sales at MileageWise, provided further insight, saying: “The IRS-proof mileage log feature of MileageWise gives peace of mind to anyone needing to track business mileage. You don’t have to worry about missed trips or inaccuracies, which can be stressful when preparing taxes or facing an audit. The IRS requires detailed and accurate logs, and any gaps or discrepancies could lead to fines or denied deductions. MileageWise uses AI to check and correct up to 70 logical conflicts, ensuring your log is bulletproof. One of the coolest features is retrospective log creation. If you missed logging trips, the AI Wizard steps in, using patterns from your past driving history and data from Google Timeline to reconstruct those trips. This not only saves time but also boosts the accuracy of your log. So, even if you’ve forgotten to track a few drives, there’s no need to worry. Another important point is the tool's versatility.
