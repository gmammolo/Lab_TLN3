  "text": "Beam has released the SubSLAM X3 subsea perception system designed to support monitoring and maintenance of offshore wind farms through real-time, high-resolution 3D mapping. The development integrates artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technologies. It generates 4K resolution video and precise 3D reconstructions, Beam added, enabling inspection of underwater structures and intelligent autonomous control of underwater vehicles. The imaging and computational capabilities of SubSLAM X3 represent an upgrade on the predecessor system, SubSLAM X2, providing faster and more accurate visualization, analysis and measurement of offshore infrastructure. In addition, the new V3.0 software is said to improve the system’s ability to assist pilots in navigating difficult underwater terrains, facilitating capture of detailed 3D models. Another benefit is improved synchronization with third-party sensors including sonar fusion, expanding capabilities in various operational settings. Finally, SubSLAM X3 is more compact and lightweight than its previous version, allowing integration into smaller observation-class and larger work-class ROVs. It can operate in water depths of up to 3,000 m.",
