  "text": "In a stroke of evolutionary brilliance, dogs have made themselves indispensable to humans as workers and companions. That kind of sticktoitiveness — and those adorable faces — deserve the best when it comes to chow time. Nom Nom's line of freshly-made dog food gives your four-legged family member a balanced, nutrient-dense meal. The high-quality, protein-packed recipes are so good they can double as treats or meal toppers for a fully satisfied pup. Enjoy 50% off your first box and free shipping.\nPresented by Nom Nom.\nRowing machines engage 86% of your muscles and can burn up to 400 calories in just 20 minutes. Hydrow might be the best rower in the world, combining those workout benefits into a sleek new tech-savvy machine. Hydrow is made with commercial-grade components, with a 10-roller smooth gliding seat, and has been tested to last for over 3 million cycles. It also features a 22\" HD touchscreen monitor with a hi-fi speaker for over 5,000 workouts led by Olympians and world-class athletes, stretching beyond rowing to cover HIIT, circuit training, yoga, and more. From 10/11 to 10/20, enjoy $400 off the Pro and $200 off the Wave as part of Hydrow's Pre-Holiday Sale using codes UNCRATEWAVE and UNCRATEPRO.\nPresented by Hydrow.\nSome styling creams need heat to set. Others leave hair vulnerable to frizz and can leave hair greasy, or even damaged. OXFORDhill's Air Dry Styling Cream is formulated with 16 powerful plant-based ingredients that deliver the perfect amount of hold while actively improving hair health over time. The cream works with all hair types and textures and is silicone-free, vegan, and crafted without animal by-products or testing. Just scrunch it into wet, style, and go; when you run out, the aluminum tube is infinitely recyclable.\nPresented by OXFORDhill.\nThough they're simple-looking, few four-wheel suitcases are all that easy to maneuver, especially in a crowded, never-ending airport. When you have to get through security and from Gate A to Gate Z in a hurry, your best bet is something two-wheeled, with features meant to make zig-zagging through traffic much less stressful — and, if your bags are heavy, far less exhausting. That's where Db's stylish 90L The Hugger, a checked-bag-sized rolling suitcase with plenty of space inside (and a zipper that opens a full 360 degrees), a lightweight yet durable poly outside, and a patented mechanism designed to make carrying a bag and a backpack easier than ever before called the Hook-Up System. Simply attach one of Db's backpacks to the backside of The Hugger and the weight of two bags quickly becomes more manageable, especially since all of the weight is positioned above the wheels.\nPresented by Db.",
