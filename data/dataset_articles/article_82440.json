  "text": "Mysten Labs has launched the public testnet for Walrus Protocol, a decentralized storage network designed to store large data files such as videos, audio, and images.\nThe testnet, built on the Sui ( SUI ) blockchain, introduces several key features, including the ability to delete stored files, a staking system, and an explorer tool for users to search and manage data, according to a press release.\nDecentralized storage distributes files across multiple independent storage nodes rather than relying on a single company to store data (as with traditional cloud services), providing better security and resilience.\nWalrus Protocol uses a method that breaks large files into smaller pieces, distributing them across different locations. Even if some pieces are lost, the entire file can still be reassembled, ensuring users maintain continuous access to their data.\nYou might also like: Polymarket users jockey over $50m ‘Trump coin’ bet Walrus on Sui The Walrus testnet is powered by Sui, a blockchain that helps manage the storage system efficiently. It also supports a testnet token called WAL, which allows users to stake tokens (temporarily lock them in the system) and earn rewards for helping run the network.\nThe protocol aims to make decentralized storage fast and reliable for applications that store rich media.\nTwo notable partners, Akord and Decrypt Media, are joining Walrus. Akord is moving its secure storage platform to Walrus from Arweave, and Decrypt Media is integrating to store its media files on the network, according to the release.\nYou might also like: Crypto expert who earned $500M on Kaspa is bullish on this crypto gem under $0.001",
