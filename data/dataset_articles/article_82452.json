  "text": "The Republic of Korea (ROK) Navy has taken a significant step in enhancing its national naval security force by selecting Samsung Electronics and KT Corporation to deploy a private 5G network for its Smart Naval Port project. This marks the first deployment of its kind at a Korean Naval base and aims to improve battleship and base operation support capabilities while achieving comprehensive base defence.\nSamsung emphasized the importance of private 5G solutions for national defence sectors, highlighting the need for ultrafast speeds and hyper-connected communications to ensure foolproof and effective operation management. By building a highly reliable network dedicated to the navy, the deployment aims to increase security and reduce vulnerabilities.\nThe Korean consumer electronics giant and domestic telco will work together to build an intelligent and fully independent network infrastructure for the Republic of Korea Navy 2nd Fleet. The project, which began in the summer, is expected to be completed by December 2025. Samsung will provide its end-to-end private 5G network solution, including the private network 5G SA Compact Core, indoor and outdoor radio solutions, and network management software. These solutions will support the mid-band spectrum widely adopted for military usage.\nIn addition to providing enhanced connectivity and coverage, the deployment will focus on applying artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled connectivity solutions to support a variety of next-generation applications. These applications include a digital twin of the smart naval base, intelligent security monitoring, and a battleship operation management system. The digital twin will serve as a three-dimensional digital replica of the base, aiding in decision-making related to base resilience, efficiency, adaptability, and autonomy.\nThe intelligent security monitoring system will enhance base defence through real-time video control of operational forces, surveillance cameras for ammunition depots and armouries, and surveillance drones. This monitoring system will provide a holistic view of the base for optimal operational response in emergency situations. The battleship operation management system will integrate critical systems to streamline administrative work for navy personnel.\nSamsung Electronics vice-president, Simon Lee, expressed excitement about deploying Korea’s first private 5G network at a naval base. He highlighted the security, reliability, and commercial expertise of Samsung’s private 5G solutions, which have been trusted by various private and public sectors in countries like South Korea, the US, and Japan. The collaboration with KT Corporation underscores Samsung’s commitment to unlocking the potential of 5G to meet the diverse needs of its customers.",
