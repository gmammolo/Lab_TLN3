  "text": "\"The magnitude of benefit, trajectory of symptomatic improvement, and dependency on the number of treatment sessions showed a treatment effect similar to that found in adults,\" stated study authors. In a study that featured the largest sample to date of adolescents and young adults treated with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for major depressive disorder (MDD), TMS treatment with NeuroStar (Neuronetics) led to improvements in depressive symptoms and anxiety among in this population. The study was presented at the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) meeting in Seattle, Washington, taking place from October 14 - 19, 2024.1,2 Investigators sought to determine the outcomes of adolescents and young adults aged 12 to 21 years with depression and anxiety who were treated with TMS in community settings.1 Presenter Paul E. Croarkin, DO, MS, Professor of Psychiatry, Pediatrics, and Pharmacology, Ervin A. and Margaret C. Mueller Director, Mayo Clinic Children's Research Center, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, and authors noted data were extracted from a treatment registry of 1283 patients with MDD.1 Of these, 682 were aged 12 to 19 years and 601 were aged 20 to 21 years. The primary outcome measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ–9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD–7).1 \"Dose-response related to the number of sessions and effectiveness were compared, as well as the trajectory of symptomatic improvement over the course of treatment,\" wrote the authors in a study abstract. \"The analyses examined outcomes from patients who completed 20 or more sessions and an intent-to-treat sample.\"1 According to results, in completer sample (n = 1169) 59.4% and 36.4% me the PHQ-9 response and remission criteria, respectively. Marked dose-response effects were observed, with antidepressant effectiveness improving with longer treatment courses (F5,1277 = 19.10; [P < .0001]).1 \"The trajectory of improvement showed the greatest symptom reduction over the first 10 sessions, with no plateau before treatment termination,\" stated the study authors. In addition, there was a significant correlation between percentage change in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores (r [129] = 0.77; [P < .001]).1 “These data are robust and reinforce the positive trend adolescent psychiatrists have seen since the FDA-clearance of NeuroStar for adolescents aged 15 and up earlier this year, which is the overwhelmingly positive clinical outcomes for young patients with major depressive disorder,” said Melissa Fickey, MD, in a press release.2 Fickey, of Embracing Life Wellness Center, is an AACAP member, and board-certified child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist.2 \"With an impressive 78% response rate and 48% remission rate for this population, NeuroStar is truly making a difference in the lives of adolescents across the country struggling with depression,\" added Fickey.2 Overall, results from the study demonstrated improvement in both depressive symptoms and anxiety in adolescents and young adults, the study authors concluded.1 \"The magnitude of benefit, trajectory of symptomatic improvement, and dependency on the number of treatment sessions showed a treatment effect similar to that found in adults,\" they wrote.1 References: 1.
