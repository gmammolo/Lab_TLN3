  "text": "The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has revealed plans to upgrade the airport with hopes of transforming it into a \"world-class getaway\" with modernized terminals. It's called the [EWR Development Plan](https://www.ewrredevelopment.com/), and it calls for a complete upgrade of Terminal B to match the newly renovated Terminal A, an overhaul of the outdated roadway network, and a redesign of the delay-prone aircraft taxiway network. The Port Authority expects to begin a two- to three-year planning process in 2025 for major elements of the redevelopment, including cost projections and project delivery alternatives. Major elements of the plans to modernize the 96-year-old airport include: Terminal development: Modern, engaging, and comfortable terminals that reflect their communities are at the heart of the EWR Vision Plan. The plan calls for building a new, world-class international terminal to replace the current Terminal B, while enhancing Terminal C to improve the customer experience. Both would complement the airport’s award-winning new Terminal A that opened in January 2023, which could also see further expansion. The spacious, streamlined terminals would allow the airport to accommodate continued growth in passenger volume, while leaving space for further expansion as needed.- Airside development: The plan envisions improving the airport’s operations with a more efficient and resilient taxiway network, while accommodating the industry trend toward larger aircraft. The new network would increase parking capacity and flexibility for aircraft, while creating redundancies to minimize delays during irregular operations. It incorporates additional deicing facilities, allowing aircraft to push off from gates more quickly. It would also include the industry’s latest safety standards, increasing straight taxiway segments and minimizing the need for crossings. - Landside development: The blueprint looks to transform the airport’s vehicular and multi-modal access, prioritizing efficiency and convenience for all users. Alongside terminal buildings, frontages would be expanded to meet industry standards, providing ample space for passenger waiting, loading and unloading while minimizing walking distances. AirTrain access would be simplified, while connectivity and amenities for cyclists, pedestrians, and service vehicles would be improved. The roadway network would also be streamlined to reduce decision points and separate major flows with independent circulation for each terminal. “A modern, efficient, world-class Newark Liberty Airport is more than just a dream. We now have an actionable path forward thanks to this comprehensive vision plan,” Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole said. “As the blueprint shows, we’re ready to take a top-to-bottom look at everything from terminals to roadways to taxiways as we build EWR into a best-in-class global gateway and position it to continue serving as a vital economic engine for New Jersey and the region.” [Click here] to follow Daily Voice Roxbury-Mount Arlington and receive free news updates.",
