  "text": "Bitdefender has launched Scam Copilot, an AI-powered platform designed to combat online scams and fraud. The platform integrates with Bitdefender’s digital life protection consumer products to safeguard devices such as computers, tablets, and mobile phones. Scam Copilot targets scams and fraud across different communication channels and digital environments.\nIt enhances protection against malware, credential theft, and data breaches. A study from the Global Anti-Scam Alliance stated that global losses from scams exceeded one trillion USD in 2023. With 78% of nearly 50,000 individuals surveyed experiencing at least one scam in the preceding year, the findings underscore the urgent need for sophisticated defensive measures.\nThe emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) in AI has equipped cybercriminals with tools to create highly persuasive phishing messages efficiently. This complicates efforts for individuals to discern scam attempts independently. Scam Copilot consolidates Bitdefender’s scam detection and prevention technologies.\nIt offers real-time monitoring, detection, and alerting of scams during web browsing, emailing, and chatting. The platform leverages AI, continuously learning and adapting to new scam methodologies.\nCombatting online scams with AI Scam Copilot’s features include comprehensive fraud protection across web browsing, email services, chat applications, push notifications, and calendars. Its AI-powered chatbot provides users with practical guidance and verification of potential scams. The platform also issues geo-specific scam wave alerts to inform users of regional scam campaigns.\nRecognizing that certain demographics are more vulnerable to scams, Scam Copilot includes tailored safeguards for seniors, children, and teenagers. It adapts the platform’s response to individual user behaviors. A significant focus of Scam Copilot is educational.\nIt provides users with contextual advice aimed at increasing scam awareness, enabling them to navigate digital interactions with greater confidence. Ciprian Istrate, Senior Vice President of Operations, Consumer Solutions Group at Bitdefender, commented, “The rapid growth and sophistication of online scams has made it incredibly challenging for consumers to safeguard their digital lives. While the term ‘scam’ may sound innocuous, the consequences are far from trivial, often leading to identity theft, financial and data loss.\nScam Copilot is a true gamechanger; we have integrated our most advanced anti-scam technologies into our market leading consumer security solutions to ensure our customers remain protected as threats evolve.”\nScam Copilot is currently available as part of Bitdefender’s Ultimate Security packages and Premium Security offering. It is compatible with Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android devices.\nRelated Posts New UNESCO report highlights ocean threats The Future of Visual Programming Comparing different methods of testing your Infrastructure-as-Code Find Compilation Time of any Code and Execution Time of any Command Microsoft PowerShell Now Open Source, Available for Linux",
