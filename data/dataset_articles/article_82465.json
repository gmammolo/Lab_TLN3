  "text": "Celebrating 20 years of breakthrough environmental research and solutions The Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment marks two decades of transformative impact. The institute’s innovative approach to bringing together experts from disparate fields to tackle pressing environmental challenges has redefined the relationship between science, policy, and real-world solutions. In 2004, Facebook went live, NASA landed rovers on Mars, and a new era in solutions-oriented academic collaboration was emerging. A group of visionary Stanford faculty members — including Walter Falcon, Don Kennedy, Rosamond Naylor , Peter Vitousek , Pamela Matson , Jeffrey Koseff , and Barton “Buzz” Thompson — realized the environmental challenges facing the world were too big and complex to tackle through traditional, siloed academic approaches. They understood that the path to meaningful answers lay in bridging disciplines, combining expertise, and fostering collaboration across the university’s schools. Twenty years later, their legacy – the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment – is more vital than ever ( watch the Institute's 20th anniversary symposium ). “There were bits and pieces all over Stanford,” Matson recalled of innovative environmental research underway at the university’s seven schools. “But wouldn’t it be great if there could be something more, if the whole could be greater than the sum of the parts?” This insight, paired with the leadership of Stanford’s then-President John Hennessy and Provost John Etchemendy, and the backing of generous donors, such as Ward Woods, Bill Landreth, and Joan and Mel Lane, led to the creation of the Woods Institute. We’ve shown what’s possible when you bring together the best minds from across disciplines, focused on solutions. ” From the start, Woods led the way in bringing together researchers from fields as disparate as engineering and epidemiology through programs such as the Environmental Venture Projects (EVP), which seeds high-risk, high-reward work. Among them were projects that helped lead to more effective coastal climate adaptation, a global initiative that changed how governments and organizations account for the value of nature, and a new paradigm for tracking and treating viruses in wastewater. As founding co-directors, Koseff, an expert in fluid mechanics, and Thompson, an environmental law expert, were living examples of the Institute’s ethos. “It was incredibly important to signal to the community that this was not just a technology enterprise, this was not just a science or physical science or engineering enterprise,” Koseff said. “This involved the humanities and the social sciences. So, having co-directors that came from those two parts of the campus sent a very important signal that everybody was valued, and everybody was welcome in the Woods Institute.” \"Uncommon Dialogue | Hydropower, River Restoration, and Public Safety In 2018 we convened key stakeholders for a series of dialogues designed to advance the renewable energy and storage benefits of hydropower while enhancing the environmental and economic benefits of healthy rivers. Looking ahead, Chris Field , the Institute’s director since 2016, sees Woods as uniquely positioned to address the \"green on green conflicts\" of the next decades—balancing environmental objectives like renewable energy expansion with the preservation of ecosystems and biodiversity. Woods’ interdisciplinary model will continue to be essential as the need for climate adaptation strategies grows in areas like food, water, and infrastructure. Evidence of that enduring influence can be found in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability , the university’s first new school in 70 years when it was created in 2022.
