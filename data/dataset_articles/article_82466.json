  "text": "Government funds research into wearable technology, virtual reality and artificial intelligence to support people with drug addictions and save lives - Projects include body-worn devices which alert emergency services if overdose is expected - 11 projects across UK could be rolled out more widely if successful Thousands of lives could be saved through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and wearable technology designed to reduce drug deaths and improve outcomes. The government has awarded £12 million to projects across the UK that are researching innovative technology to support people with addictions. One of the chosen projects, called PneumoWave ALERT, pairs a chest-worn sensor that monitors breathing to a mobile device that sends out an immediate alert to nearby antidote carriers and emergency services if an overdose is detected, helping people get potentially life-saving treatment as soon as possible. Another study will look at using virtual reality to help people overcome their triggers for cocaine addiction. People will be assessed using watch-like devices to determine which cues in their environment lead to a drug craving, by measuring physical changes to the body. Virtual reality will then be used to create realistic situations to repeatedly expose people to triggers in a safe environment. Previous research shows cue exposure treatment (CET) can significantly reduce the level of craving and relapse among alcoholics, but it has not yet been fully explored for people experiencing a cocaine addiction until now. Minister for Public Health and Prevention, Andrew Gwynne said: Drug addiction devastates lives and rips apart families, and this government is committed to gripping this problem. We're determined to harness the full potential of cutting-edge technology to save thousands of lives across the country. I want the UK to lead the way in championing innovation to end the harmful effects of addiction. The research is being funded through the Addiction Healthcare Goals programme, which is run by the Office for Life Sciences (OLS). Around £12 million has been awarded to 11 projects across eight organisations in the UK. The projects were selected as part of the Reducing Drug Deaths Challenge and the NIHR i4i Addiction: Innovation for Treatment and Recovery Awards, which are being run in partnership with the Scottish government and National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR). The funding will also support research to improve the accessibility of the life-saving drug naloxone. Naloxone rapidly reverses heroin and opioid overdose but is typically available as an injection or nasal spray which have limitations and cannot always be used in time. Kings College London is looking into naloxone wafers which melt in the mouth and provide rapid access to this emergency medicine and can fit easily in a wallet or purse. Several of the projects are based in Scotland which has the highest rate of drug deaths in Europe. These include a wristband to monitor vital signs such as blood oxygen levels, heart rate and body temperature. If an overdose is suspected, the device, named \"Saving Sam\", will send out an alert to a trusted contact. This research is being run by the University of Edinburgh and NHS Fife. The technology being researched could be rolled out to more sites across the UK if successful. The projects support the government's Health Mission - building an NHS fit for the future - by helping to embed a greater focus on prevention and supporting services. It also helps establish the UK as a global leader for innovative treatments and technologies, supporting the UK's Growth Mission - for sustained economic growth, good jobs and increased productivity across the country - by inspiring healthcare companies to invest in the UK, while supporting people back into stable work. Science Minister Lord Vallance said: The UK's life sciences sector plays a critical role in finding new ways to tackle the biggest challenges facing healthcare, including the devastating impact of addiction. The Addiction Healthcare Goals Programme is testament to our commitment to bringing together researchers, clinicians, and innovators to create real change. From wearable technology to AI-powered tools, these innovative projects highlight the power of collaboration in delivering life-saving treatments. By investing in these partnerships, we are tackling addiction head-on and ensuring that cutting-edge science reaches those who need it most, improving public health across the UK. Professor Mike Lewis, NIHR's Scientific Director for Innovation, said: Innovation in managing addiction is needed to break the pattern of prison relapse and rebound and the wider impacts of addiction on society. Through the NIHR i4i Addiction: Innovation for Treatment and Recovery Awards, successful projects have been awarded funding to develop approaches to improve treatment and recovery outcomes. Interventions, including AI, that allow management in the community need this research to validate their potential so we can implement them at scale. Professor Dame Anna Dominiczak, Chief Scientific Advisor for Health, Scottish Government, said: Tackling drug-related deaths is a priority for the Scottish Government and NHS Scotland and we are committed to tackling these issues through targeted research, innovation and support. As part of phase two of the Reducing Drug Deaths Innovation Competition, funding has been awarded to develop seven prototypes aimed at reducing drug deaths. These innovative solutions include wearable sensors, digital monitoring and alert applications as well as novel antidote delivery systems. By harnessing the expertise we have in Scotland and across the rest of the UK, we can continue to develop new technologies to drive prevention initiatives. Professor Anne Lingford-Hughes, Chair of the Addiction Healthcare Goals, said: New approaches to treat drug addiction and reduce drug related deaths, particularly from overdose, are urgently needed. The Addiction Healthcare Goals programme is pleased to fund promising innovations that have brought together partnerships between industry, academia and organisations involved in delivering treatment and care for those experiencing drug addictions. Establishing such collaborations also enhances the UK's research capacity and ability to deliver novel patient research. This lays firm foundations for the UK to accelerate the development and testing of effective innovations to use in routine care to save lives, reduce harms, and benefit society.
