  "text": "Meet The ‘Radical’ Bangalore Techies Building The ‘Tesla Of India’ The future of mobility, as we know it, is being re-written by two visionaries from Bangalore, Narayan Subramaniam and Niraj Rajmohan. They are the masterminds behind [Ultraviolette Automotive](https://www.mensxp.com/auto/electric-bikes/161904-entry-level-sport-motorcycles-comparison.html), the company that’s being hailed as the Tesla of India. But who are these techies turning heads and redefining mobility? MensXP caught up with the two founders for an interview. Here’s how it went: 1. How has the market reception and customer feedback for Ultraviolette's electric motorcycles been so far? Narayan Subramaniam: We launched the F77 in April 2023, after about seven to eight years of R&D to get to that point. The market reception and customer feedback have been tremendously positive, particularly on the design and performance of the motorcycle. These were the two core aspects we aimed to disrupt entirely. The fact that the F77 looks like nothing else on the road gives it a commanding presence. The performance aspects—the tech, the acceleration, the power, the top speed—are all packaged into an experience that’s quite unlike anything riders have felt on an internal combustion (IC) engine bike. Niraj Rajmohan: Those two elements, design and performance, are real hits. They resonate strongly with our community. People who were waiting for a performance-focused electric motorcycle have been excited to finally see it in this segment. While we’ve seen performance electric cars from brands like Tesla, there hadn’t been a similar breakthrough for motorcycles. People have followed us since 2017-2018, and many of them ended up buying the bikes and being super happy about it. For us, the goal was to introduce new technologies into segments where they didn’t exist before, and the F77 has successfully done that. 2. What core values do you both hold dear, and how do they influence your decisions both personally and professionally? Narayan Subramaniam: For me, it goes back to my background as a designer. I’ve worked in the automotive industry for a long time, and one thing that always frustrated me was how India has never really been on the global map when it comes to producing desirable, high-quality products. We’ve always looked to the East or West—Japan for motorcycles, Italy for sexy cars—and that dissatisfaction drove me. I knew we had the talent, and through my work in India and abroad, I saw firsthand the caliber of our people. It’s surprising that we hadn’t created something world-class, and that’s been a driving factor for me. I wanted to change that narrative with Ultraviolette. Niraj Rajmohan: For me, the core value is problem-solving, especially from an engineering standpoint. Electric vehicles—particularly electric motorcycles—pose some really tough physics and engineering challenges, especially when you move beyond scooters into the realm of 300cc motorcycles and upwards. Solving these kinds of challenges is what excited me from the start. It's not something you solve in one shot; in our case, it took seven years. But that's what drives us—figuring out these foundational aspects of physics and engineering. Gavin: Persistence and resilience play a big role in that journey, right? Niraj Rajmohan: Absolutely. The number of setbacks along the way were numerous. There were several moments when we thought, \"Maybe this isn't possible.\" But over time, we pushed through those obstacles and eventually got to the final production stage. It took resilience, for sure. Narayan Subramaniam: I’d say one of our core values is an uncompromising approach to design and technology. That’s something we’ll hold on to, no matter what segment we enter in the future. We want Ultraviolette to be synonymous with cutting-edge design and tech, and we won’t waver from that. 3. What is your leadership philosophy? Who inspired it? Narayan Subramaniam: I’d say our leadership philosophy has been shaped by various people we’ve read about or studied—how they’ve overcome hurdles, navigated difficult phases, and led through tough circumstances. It’s not that we’ve molded ourselves after any one or two specific individuals, but rather, it’s been a learning curve. For us, leadership is about more than just verbalizing a vision—it’s about getting in there, doing the work, and leading by example. Gavin: Is the proof in the pudding? Narayan Subramaniam: Exactly. We’ve had to live by that, especially in the early days when we were just a two or three-member team back in 2016. We were responsible for everything—every department of the company. As we grew to 10 people and eventually to about 300 now, we maintained a cross-collaborative culture where both of us are involved in many areas of the business. Our hands-on involvement has always been key, especially on the technical side, but also in operational aspects. Niraj Rajmohan:That means we’re both deeply involved in what goes on across the company, from tech to operations. We believe in being hands-on, and that’s something we’ve always carried with us as leaders. 4. Do you feel that there is a challenge you face with turning people's mentality around regarding electric bikes? Niraj Rajmohan: Absolutely, and we're still trying to solve that at scale. People who get to ride the bikes experience an instant switch in their mindset—like, \"Wow, I didn’t know electric could feel this good.\" But the challenge is that you can’t get a billion people to ride the bike tomorrow, right? It's going to take time for that shift to happen, for people to realize what’s going on here. One way to address this is through test rides, but we also need to raise awareness without needing everyone to physically ride the bike. That's the challenge we're working to solve, and it’s going to require multiple approaches. We need to dispel the old notion that electric vehicles can't be powerful. Gavin: Yeah, like, it’s not just kids' play anymore. Narayan Subramaniam: Exactly. That’s a good way to phrase it. It used to be a misconception, but we’re changing that narrative. 5. Could you share some personal insights and philosophies that have driven you both in your professional and entrepreneurial journey? Niraj Rajmohan: Probably one thing my dad etched into my psychology quite a while back is, “Success is 99 percent perspiration, 1 percent inspiration.” I strongly believe in that. You can have great ideas, which are essential to get started, but when you’re working on a project as complex as this—building a high-performance electric motorcycle—it’s never a solo task. It’s about hundreds of people coming together, coordinating everything at the right time with the right motivation. Gavin: Did you find it easy to let go of problem-solving, especially since you’re so deep into it? I imagine you’d want to solve every problem yourself. Niraj Rajmohan: Oh, no! We realised early on that we can't solve everything ourselves. Now, we have professionals across various departments, but the most critical or unsolvable problems still find their way up to us. We’re still doing the same thing, just at a larger scale. But we don’t take on every problem—it’s just not possible to handle everything. Narayan Subramaniam: And to be honest, we may not always be the best people to solve every problem. We’ve built a team that can tackle those issues, but when it’s something no one else can crack, it filters up to us. 6. What were some of the major challenges you both faced while developing Ultraviolette's electric motorcycle, and how did you overcome them? Narayan Subramaniam: A significant challenge was changing the perception of electric vehicles in India. For years, people associated electric two-wheelers with low-powered, unreliable scooters. We had to break through that mindset by delivering a high-performance vehicle. It wasn’t easy. Overcoming years of market skepticism took a lot of persistence and proving the F77’s capabilities through test rides and demonstrations. Niraj Rajmohan: Technically, solving the physics behind a high-performance electric motorcycle was difficult. We had to solve problems that had never been solved in India before. It took us seven years to overcome these challenges, but we were driven by the belief that if we cracked it, we’d be able to change the entire electric vehicle narrative in India. 7. Niraj, Narayan, how do you deal with self-doubt and setbacks in your journey so far? Narayan Subramaniam: I'd say we’ve never really faced self-doubt because we’re very open-minded. We’re always open to someone telling us there’s a better way to do something. You typically face self-doubt when you’re too stubborn, and then you start questioning, \"Am I doing things the right way?\" But I think we’ve been fluid enough in our approach to avoid that. During our journey, we’ve been open to getting feedback or ideas from multiple sources—our team, people outside the ecosystem, advisors, and even our families. Gavin: So you’re saying you bring your personal life into it as well? Do you allow family input into the decision-making process? Narayan Subramaniam: Absolutely. We haven’t had the luxury to separate the two. (laughs) Niraj Rajmohan: Yeah, it's true. The number of things we’re solving at any given time consumes all of our energy and focus. There’s no off switch—it's always on. And that’s been the case for the last seven years with Ultraviolette. Narayan Subramaniam: For example, during some of our early investor meetings, we got feedback like, “Why don’t you guys just import from another country and start selling? You can think about R&D later.” But we had to be confident and say, “No, that’s not what we’re here to do.” There may be 100 other companies doing that, but it’s not our path. Niraj Rajmohan: Exactly. These kinds of situations helped us build guardrails against unnecessary self-doubt. You meet hundreds of people, and not all of them will share your vision. But that doesn’t mean you change your vision. It’s about finding the right people, which took us hundreds—if not a thousand—meetings to find the right set of backers. It felt difficult, but it was always solvable. 8. What does a typical day in your life look like, and how do you stay productive and motivated? Do you have any particular rituals or belief systems that help you get in the zone? Narayan Subramaniam: Our joke at the office is that once you step in, it feels like you’re in a Mumbai local train—just getting swept along with everything happening around you. We don’t have a strict routine; every day guides us. While it may seem overwhelming, we enjoy the process of problem-solving, and that keeps us motivated. Niraj Rajmohan: It's not like there's a set routine once we enter the workplace. It flows. The day guides us more than us trying to control how the day is shaping up. 9. Can you share a defining moment in your career that significantly impacted your approach to building Ultraviolette? Niraj Rajmohan: One defining moment for us was when we built the first set of prototypes between 2017 and 2019. We used to take the bikes out for a spin in a part of Bangalore called Jayanagar. Even back then, we knew we were onto something because we set really high aspirations for ourselves. We didn't have a budget for formal racetracks or testing tracks, so we just raced on the roads and set targets—like identifying four specific bikes we needed to be faster than. Every day, we’d improve by half a second or a quarter second, then go back to the shop to tweak things. Narayan Subramaniam: And the office was on the first floor, with no service elevator, so it took eight people to carry the bikes up and down. It was a lot of hard work, but also fun. On Sundays, we’d go to Nice Road on the outskirts of the city at 5 a.m. to fine-tune the bikes. Every Sunday, we’d try to shave off 0.1 of a second. It sounds small, but that kind of progress felt like a win. Over time, we realized we were faster than all the internal combustion (IC) engines on the road. Niraj Rajmohan: Another defining moment came right before the launch in November 2019. We had been working on the bikes for about four or five years at that point, and we wanted some outside feedback. So, we organized focus groups with different biking clubs and groups to show them the bikes for the first time. Narayan Subramaniam: During one of these meetings, we had this last-minute idea to offer pre-bookings for 10,000 INR, even though the bike was still a few months away from being ready. We weren’t sure if people would go for it, but in the first group, three people immediately put down 10k to pre-book. One guy wasn’t even invited—he was a friend of someone who was invited—and he paid 10k on the spot, joking that he didn’t know how he was going to explain this expensive “idli” breakfast to his dad. Another person didn’t have the full amount and said, “I’ve only got 5k today; I’ll bring the rest next week.” It showed us just how strongly we’d struck an emotional chord with people. Niraj Rajmohan: And all of these people, those who signed up in 2019, ended up buying the bikes when we finally launched them last year. That entire experience really showed us the emotional connection people had with the product, and it was a huge moment for us as a company. 10. What are your views on work-life balance? Is it possible to maintain a work-life balance while leading a high-paced tech company? Narayan Subramaniam: Obviously, I think there needs to be some sense of work-life balance. But when you're working on such ambitious tasks, it’s really hard to draw a clear line of separation. Solving these kinds of problems consumes your mind to the point where you can’t just switch off. Ideally, in the future, we’d like to achieve a more even distribution of time—maybe not outsource responsibilities, because we still enjoy it—but have a little more free time. Gavin: What would you do with that free time? Besides putting it back into Ultraviolette, what would you do for yourself? Narayan Subramaniam: I don’t know. Honestly, if you’re creating something that’s never been done before, you can’t really talk about work-life balance. I’m clear on that. Niraj Rajmohan: I’m still hopeful, though! (laughs) Narayan Subramaniam: (Laughs) No, but we genuinely enjoy what we do, so it doesn’t get too frustrating. 11. What are your future plans for Ultraviolette? Narayan Subramaniam: Maybe we can start by giving you an idea of the kind of companies we admire and the vision we have for Ultraviolette. In the early 2000s, Sony was one of the first companies to disrupt consumer tech. They brought innovation, particularly with products like the Walkman. Sony in the 90s and early 2000s was huge, but eventually, Apple took over with their own reinventions. Then, there’s Nike—a company that has reinvented itself multiple times and stayed relevant across design, lifestyle, and tech. Gavin: Yeah, Nike was big in sport, tech, and lifestyle. Remember when they had Nike ID where you could customize your own sneakers? Narayan Subramaniam: Exactly. These are the companies that excite us. We appreciate certain aspects of companies like BMW or Ferrari, but we don’t want to build an automobile-centric brand like that. We're more focused on creating products that blend cutting-edge design with lifestyle and technology. Niraj Rajmohan: For us, the goal has always been to scale internationally. The F77 was designed with that global market in mind, and now we’re moving toward that international roadmap. The F77 was always meant to be viable in markets like Europe, the US, and other parts of Southeast Asia. We're excited to take this next step and expand the brand beyond India. 12. What do you think of the legacy companies’ views on the future of motorcycles and how do you see the market evolving – will we see the responsibility of innovation move to newer companies? Narayan Subramaniam: We’ve been faced with naysayers both from within and outside the industry. The legacy companies have ceded ground by saying Indian brands only are relevant up to a certain threshold and that their partner brands would hold the mantle above a certain price point or a performance band. We don’t believe this – we should have India put up the best of what it can offer in terms of design-led, tech-enabled performance. Coming to the specific comments made in the recent past, we in the auto industry are privileged to be in the public eye all throughout – our products/brands are tested in the public eye – we can make it interesting! We can bring the best of what we have to offer, and we invite all our competitors to put up what they have to offer in terms of what Indian R&D and Engineering has had to offer over the last few years. We can settle it machine vs machine (!) for us to figure who really is pushing the boundaries of tech & innovation in India. The Future of Mobility Needless to say, Narayan and Niraj’s journey from techies to trailblazers is nothing short of inspirational. Through Ultraviolette they’re redefining the future of electric mobility in India! [MensXP Mr India 2014](/tag/mensxp-mr-india-2014.html)",
