  "text": "We recently received the [6.3-inch Pixel 9 Pro from Google](https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/2024/08/13/google-pixel-9-pro-pro-xl-pro-fold/), and after spending some hands-on time with it, it’s clear that this is just another member of this year’s Pixel family that is making the case for the best choice for Android users. Let’s dive into what’s new for the Pixel 9 Pro this year. Display & Design The 6.3-inch OLED display is one of the brightest we’ve tested—it really shines, especially in direct sunlight. We’re talking 3,000 max nits brightness (iPhone 16 series is 2,000 max nits), which is incredibly bright. The resolution is sharp, offering QHD+ (1440 x 3120 at 495 ppi) quality with a smooth 120 Hz refresh rate. The Pixel 9 Pro feels just right in the hand—it’s not too large to manage one-handed. The Rose Quartz colour, available only in the [256GB storage option in Canada for $1,479](https://store.google.com/ca/product/pixel_9_pro?hl=en-GB), is a beautiful light creamy rose that adds a unique, stylish flair. It’s a refreshing change from the standard smartphone colours, with the matte finish adding a touch of sophistication. Power & Performance The Pixel 9 Pro is powered by Google’s new Tensor G3 chip, which is designed to optimize AI and machine learning tasks. It’s a powerhouse for everyday use, from multitasking to demanding apps and gaming. The phone also boasts 16GB of RAM, up from the 12GB in last year’s Pixel 8 Pro. Below is the Pixel 9 Pro in its matching silicone case, which is thin and offers full coverage even for the rear camera bump. Storage options start at 128GB, but as mentioned, the Rose Quartz model only comes in the 256GB version, giving you ample space for photos, videos, and apps, while there’s also a 512GB option for Hazel and Obsidian. The battery is a solid 4,700mAh (same as Pixel 9), which comfortably lasts a full day with regular use. Plus, with 30W wired fast charging and wireless charging support, you’ll spend less time tethered to a charger. Camera System Google’s Pixel phones are known for their camera performance, and the Pixel 9 Pro continues this tradition. It features a triple-camera setup with a 50MP main sensor, 48MP ultra-wide lens, and a 48MP telephoto lens offering 5x optical zoom. Night Sight, which has been refined over the years, continues to impress, producing clear, vivid photos in low light. On the front, there’s a 12MP selfie camera that handles well in various lighting conditions, and Google’s AI-powered image processing does wonders in enhancing photos with minimal effort. This front camera is wide enough for your selfies and is better than the wide angle on Apple’s iPhones. Pictures taken with the Pixel 9 Pro looked great, and photos were snapped quickly. There’s not much to say as we live in a time where all smartphone cameras are pretty darn good at the moment. Software & Features [Running on Android 14](https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/2023/10/30/google-fixing-android-14-storage-bug-pixel/), the Pixel 9 Pro offers the latest Android experience ([well, Android 15 is now rolling out](https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/2024/10/15/google-rolling-out-android-15-pixel-devices/)) with clean, fast software, free from bloat. The Pixel-exclusive features, like real-time translation, call screening, and adaptive battery management, are all enhanced by Google’s Tensor G3, making everyday tasks more seamless and efficient. One of the standout features is the phone’s advanced AI and machine learning capabilities. Google Assistant is snappier, real-time transcription is faster, and camera modes like Magic Eraser, which removes unwanted objects from photos, work effortlessly. Gemini is just so powerful on Pixel devices. The Add Me feature is so fun and easy to use, as it lets you get added to any photo, stitched in using AI. Family photos will never be the same—this time you’ll actually be a part of the picture (yes, you do matter!). Security is also a focus, with the Pixel 9 Pro featuring an under-display fingerprint sensor, along with Face Unlock, both of which are fast and reliable. Where’s our under-display fingerprint sensor for the iPhone? [Here are pictures of the Pixel 9](https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/2024/10/06/google-pixel-9-pixel-buds-pro-2-hands-on/) beside the Pixel 9 Pro. Both phones are essentially the same size, but the 9 Pro has three cameras on the back: Looking at the front it’s hard to tell which phone is which: Once you look at the sides, you’ll see a matte aluminum finish on the Pixel 9, while the Pixel 9 Pro is a polished metal frame. Both phones look pretty darn good: Final Thoughts With its super bright and crisp display, top-tier camera system, and the newest Tensor G3 chip, the Pixel 9 Pro is again one of the best Android phones to consider, since you get updates first directly from Google. The 6.3-inch version we tested is comfortable to use and incredibly bright, making it perfect for media and outdoor use. The Rose Quartz variant adds a unique, stylish touch. The phone feels well-made and premium. For anyone in the market for a premium smartphone with a powerful AI-driven experience, the Pixel 9 Pro is definitely one to consider, if you have $1,349 to spare (for starters anyways) for a premium device. You get 7 years of software updates guaranteed from Google for Pixel 9 series devices. Keep an eye out for Black Friday sales or wait six months and you’ll find these on discount ahead of next year’s models.",
