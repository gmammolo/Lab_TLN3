  "text": "FBI Arrests SEC Hacker Behind Fake Bitcoin ETF Approval Tweet The [FBI arrested](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/fbi-arrests-alabama-man-january-2024-sec-x-hack-spiked-value-bitcoin) a hacker, Eric Council Jr., for his role in hacking the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) X account in January 2024. Council Jr., just 25 years old, was part of a scheme that posted a fake message claiming that the SEC had approved Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This tweet caused Bitcoin’s price to surge by over $1,000. Unfortunately, this fake news didn’t last long, and the Bitcoin price dropped dramatically after the SEC clarified that no such approval had happened. SEC Targeted Through SIM Swap Attack The attack on the SEC’s X account was carried out through a SIM swap. A SIM swap is when a hacker transfers a victim’s phone number to their own SIM card. This allows the hacker to bypass two-factor authentication, a security measure many use to protect their accounts. Council Jr. and his team used this method to gain access to the SEC’s account. Once they had control, they posted the fake Bitcoin ETF approval, which led to temporary chaos in the market. Bitcoin’s Price Manipulation After the SEC Hack As soon as the fake SEC tweet hit X, Bitcoin’s price jumped by $1,000, catching the attention of the entire crypto community. People rushed to buy more Bitcoin, thinking the ETF approval was legit. However, within just 15 minutes, SEC Chair Gary Gensler tweeted a correction, saying the SEC had not approved any Bitcoin ETFs. After the SEC regained control of their X account, Bitcoin’s price plunged by $2,000, leaving traders in shock. The incident shows just how sensitive the crypto market is to news and tweets. SEC’s Role in Bitcoin ETF Approval Ironically, only a day after the fake post, the SEC did approve several [Bitcoin ETFs](https://walletinvestor.com/magazinadmin/bitcoin-etfs-surge-with-massive-inflows/). But the damage caused by the fake tweet was already done. Many investors had already made hasty decisions based on the fraudulent post. The SEC plays a crucial role in regulating the financial markets, including crypto, so any misleading information from their official channels can cause massive price swings. FBI Investigation Uncovers Bitcoin Payments to Hacker The FBI found out that Council Jr. received payment in Bitcoin for his role in the hack. His online searches, including “SECGOV hack” and “how can I know if the FBI is investigating me,” raised red flags during the investigation. He is facing serious charges for identity theft and fraud. The case highlights the ongoing battle between regulators like the SEC and cybercriminals targeting the crypto world. The FBI is actively pursuing other conspirators in the case.
