  "text": "iOS 18.1 is on the way, and with it comes a powerful new feature called notification summaries, part of Apple’s new Apple Intelligence tools. This feature will change how notifications work, making them more useful by summarizing content with the help of AI. One of the best uses of these summaries is in the Apple Card and spending apps. Here’s why it’s a game-changer for managing expenses and income.\nWhat Are Notification Summaries? In iOS 18.1, notification summaries will be an optional feature powered by Apple Intelligence. When turned on, notifications from your apps will provide smarter, AI-generated summaries. Instead of seeing just a few lines of an email or message, you’ll get a quick, more detailed snapshot of the important information.\nFor instance, in the Mail or Messages apps, Apple Intelligence will summarize the entire message or email instead of only showing the first few lines. This saves time, letting you see the key information without having to open each notification.\nSummaries for Spending with Apple Card in iOS 18.1 One of the most useful aspects of this feature is for tracking your Apple Card spending. Apple Intelligence will automatically total your expenses from multiple Wallet notifications. Instead of getting separate notifications for each transaction, the AI summarizes them in a single, easy-to-read notification.\nFor example, let’s say you make three Apple Card purchases. Instead of three separate alerts, iOS 18.1 will combine them into one summary. Apple Intelligence even totals the amounts for you. So, if you spent $13.83, $7.44, and $13.62, you would get a single notification saying:\nMultiple purchases at Walt Disney World and others, totalling $34.89\nThis feature isn’t just limited to the Apple Card. It works with any app that sends dollar amounts in its notifications, like spending apps or even apps like Venmo, where you might receive payments. Apple Intelligence will gather all the notifications, add the amounts, and present the total, saving you the trouble of calculating it yourself.\nA Handy Tool for Managing Money While totaling amounts manually isn’t difficult, having Apple Intelligence do it for you is a convenient way to stay on top of your finances. This feature will give you a clearer picture of your spending or income, helping you stay more organized without any extra effort.\nNotification summaries make it easier to track recent expenses, and the added benefit of automatic tallying means you’re always aware of your daily spending. Whether you’re managing your Apple Card or using other spending apps, this new feature in iOS 18.1 will help streamline your financial life.\nAre you excited to try out notification summaries? Let us know how you might use it to manage your notifications or track your spending!",
