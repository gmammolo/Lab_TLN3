  "text": "Samsung continues to work on the world’s first 10-core smartphone processor. Exynos 2500, which appeared in a mysterious Samsung device a month ago, appeared in the Geekbench test. Accordingly, Exynos 2500 will come with three main high performance cores. Here is the flagship processor with ten cores and the core structure revealed. Samsung Exynos 2500 processor will use three high-performance main cores Mobile processors have been available with eight cores for many years. Even Apple processors have a six-core structure. Samsung, on the contrary to its competitors, will come up with a ten-core structure. Previously, information about the Samsung Exynos 2500 processor revealed that there would be a single main core in the processor. However, according to new Geekbench data, Exynos 2500 will come with three main performance cores. According to this data, Exynos 2500 will come with three Cortex-X925 cores, ARM’s highest performance core architecture. The operating speed of these main cores is 2.95 GHz. The chip will also include five ARM Cortex-A725 cores. The operating speed of these cores is 2.25 GHz. A-520 efficiency cores running at 1.75 GHz are added to this octa-core structure, making the processor ten-core. On the GPU side, there is a significant difference from the first Exynos 2500 processor structure. Accordingly, it was also revealed that two additional cores running at 1.3 GHz were added to the AMD Radeon-based Xclipse 950 GPU. In this sense, the Exynos 2500 processor, which we probably encountered before, was probably a trial version of the processor. It is expected that the 950, which is still ahead of the old Xclipse 940 in terms of performance, will further erode the difference with its competitors with its new structure. Samsung used 3nm fabrication production process for Exynos 2500. However, Samsung has some disadvantages, especially in the 3nm fabrication process. According to recent reports, the efficiency of Samsung’s 3nm fabrication process varies between 10 percent and 20 percent. This very low rate means that 80 percent to 90 percent of the processors produced may be damaged and unable to work properly. Samsung’s inability to increase the efficiency in processor production will cause the Exynos 2500 processor to be used only in certain countries. In other words, there is a high probability that we will see the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 processor in the US, Canada and western European countries in the Samsung S25 series. Do you think Samsung can close the big gap between the Exynos 2500 processor performance data and its competitors? We are waiting for your comments",
