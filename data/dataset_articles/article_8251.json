  "text": "Two Ky. National Guardsmen receive Medal for Valor for actions during eastern Kentucky floods LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - Two Kentucky national guardsmen were awarded with the Medal of Valor in Frankfort for their heroic efforts when Eastern Kentucky saw historic flooding. The deadly flooding in July 2022 wiped away communities, killing 39 people. The community saw bravery through the lifesaving actions of the Kentucky National Guard. The adjutant general of Kentucky said at least two lives were saved thanks to the heroic actions of Sergeant First Class Jeremy Lowe and Staff Sergeant Ryan Hunter. The pair of flight paramedics came down from a chopper, broke through the roof of the home, formed a human chain, and then saved two people who were already in chest-deep water. As the two stood in the Capitol Rotunda pinned with the Medal for Valor, they continued to show how selfless they are, thanking everyone around them. “Standing here before you, profoundly humbled by this great honor, this award is just not recognition of two flight paramedics,” Lowe said. “It’s the testament to the extraordinary teamwork, bravery, and dedication of countless individuals and organizations that united during the devastating floods.” This honor doesn’t happen often. The state has only recognized guardsmen with the Medal of Valor seven other times in the past 20 years. Copyright 2024 WAVE. All rights reserved.",
