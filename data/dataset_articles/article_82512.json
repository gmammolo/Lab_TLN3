Connect Twitch & Battle.net accounts and claim reward in Collections. Anniversary event offers various rewards until Jan 7, 2025. World of Warcraft just revealed the Sand Scarab pet as a new Twitch Drop for the MMO’s 20th anniversary update. Players who watch four hours of any World of Warcraft stream on Twitch from October 22 through November 5 can add this old TCG reward to their collection of battle pets.\nOctober 22 is going to be a big day for World of Warcraft . It marks the arrival of Patch 11.0.5 – a sizable content update introducing a bunch of balance adjustments, quality of life improvements, and an expansion to the classes Dracthyr characters can choose from. Were that not exciting enough, it also marks the beginning of WoW ’s 20th anniversary celebration event , which introduces tons of new activities and rewards for fans to enjoy.\nRelated World of Warcraft Reveals New 12-Month Subscription Offer World of Warcraft debuts a new 12-month subscription offer full of fantastic new mounts and pets for both The War Within and Cataclysm Classic.\n1 However, there is another World of Warcraft item players can get starting October 22 that doesn’t even require them to play the game. Once World of Warcraft Patch 11.0.5 goes live , fans can earn a Twitch Drop to celebrate the new release. Those who connect their Twitch and Battle.net accounts, then watch four hours of any WoW content on the streaming service before November 5, can earn the Sand Scarab battle pet, which will be automatically delivered to their Collections tab once they claim the reward.\nWorld of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Twitch Drop Close Players must first connect their Twitch and Battle.net accounts via the Connections page on Twitch. From October 22 through November 5, watch four hours of World of Warcraft content on any Twitch channel to earn the Sand Scarab pet. Claim the drop from the Twitch inventory page. Log into World of Warcraft , open up the Pets tab on the Collections interface, and unwrap the new gift. The Sand Scarab is a golden beetle battle pet originally acquired via a loot card from the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game . Though the old TCG has since been discontinued for a while, cards with valid codes can still be purchased online and redeemed, with some of the rarest loot cards running for thousands of dollars. That said, the Sand Scarab card was a pretty common card from the Tomb of the Forgotten set, so it only sold for about $10 before this promotion.\nPlayers will have plenty of other rewards to earn during World of Warcraft ’s 20th anniversary event as well. Updated Tier 2 raid armor sets, old anniversary rewards, new titles, battle pets, and a collection of transmogs inspired by the real-life Blizzard service awards can all be acquired during the celebration, so fans will have to collect as much as they can before the event ends on January 7, 2025.\nYour Rating 10 stars 9 stars 8 stars 7 stars 6 star 5 stars 4 stars 3 stars 2 stars 1 star Rate Now 0 /10\nYour comment has not been saved\n8.6 /10 World of Warcraft: The War Within\nIn this opening chapter of The Worldsoul Saga, you’ll journey through never-before-seen subterranean worlds filled with hidden wonders and lurking perils, down to the dark depths of the Nerubian empire, where the inscrutable Harbinger of the Void has gathered her arachnid forces to bring Azeroth to its knees.\nFranchise Warcraft Base Game World of Warcraft Platform(s) PC Released August 26, 2024 Developer(s) Blizzard Publisher(s) Blizzard Genre MMORPG Expand See at Battle.Net Video Games World of Warcraft Warcraft Your changes have been saved\nEmail is sent\nEmail has already been sent\nclose Please verify your email address.\nSend confirmation email close You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics.\nManage Your List Follow Followed Follow with Notifications Follow Unfollow We hope you like the items we recommend and discuss!
