  "text": "YouTube Music is making it clear that the future of streaming is about more than just passive listening. [YouTube Music](https://www.headphonesty.com/2021/03/review-youtube-music/) is [rolling out major updates](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-features-and-updates-2024/) that transform how users interact with the platform. These changes are part of a broader initiative, with over two dozen improvements being introduced across YouTube’s various platforms. The updates focus on enhancing the overall YouTube experience while offering specific enhancements to YouTube Music. Here’s what you need to know: Playlist Collaboration and Custom Thumbnails Collaborative playlists have always been a [great selling point for YouTube Music](https://www.headphonesty.com/2024/05/find-song-on-youtube-music-humming-phone/), and the platform seems to be leaning on that with the new update. Case in point: a key feature is the option for users to collaborate more easily. Users can invite friends or family to add songs by simply sharing a link or a QR code. This small accessibility update makes the collaborative process more seamless. Additionally, users can customize playlist thumbnails. They can choose images from their camera roll or use [YouTube’s generative AI](https://www.headphonesty.com/2024/07/youtube-music-tests-new-ai-radio-feature/) to create them (sort of like [Apple Music’s AI Artwork feature](https://www.headphonesty.com/2024/07/ai-artworks-coming-apple-music-playlists/)). For AI-generated thumbnails, users can tap “Create with AI,” pick a theme, and choose from AI-powered creations. But, other tools like text, filters, and stickers can also help users personalize their playlists even further. Sleep Timer and Miniplayer Enhancements The update also includes a Sleep Timer, which allows users to set a timer that pauses playback after a set time. [Previously exclusive to Premium users](https://www.yugatech.com/news/youtube-premium-launches-sleep-timer-feature/), this feature is now available to everyone. That’s great news for those who listen to music, podcasts, or watch videos before bed! YouTube’s Miniplayer has also been improved, particularly in the main YouTube mobile app. Users can now resize and move the miniplayer while browsing other content. In other words, you can [search for more content](https://www.headphonesty.com/2024/05/give-youtube-music-chance/) to add to your queue while already watching a video, making multitasking smoother. Interaction: Badges and Voting on Playlists Another fun feature allows users to earn badges for being top listeners of favorite artists via the “You” tab. Users can also earn badges for creator interaction, like having their comments hearted by creators. A new voting feature also allows users and their friends to vote on songs in shared playlists. This helps curate the best playlist content and allows creators to engage their audiences by letting viewers rank their favorite videos. Why These Changes Matter These updates are part of YouTube Music’s effort to give users more control over their experience. Allowing people to personalize, collaborate, and vote on playlist content [makes the platform feel more personal](https://www.headphonesty.com/2024/09/switching-youtube-music-spotify/). This level of interaction [helps YouTube Music stand out](https://www.headphonesty.com/2024/09/spotify-youtube-music-winning/) in a competitive streaming market by focusing on user preferences. The changes extend beyond just YouTube Music, with visual improvements across the entire YouTube ecosystem. These enhancements aim to simplify the app and help users focus on content. For instance, the [YouTube TV app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.unplugged&hl=en) is getting visual updates, including new pops of pink and other dynamic touches. Immersive channel pages on YouTube TV now also feature auto-playing video teasers when visiting a creator’s channel, providing a more engaging browsing experience. Plus, the new features may hint at more interactive updates in the future. As digital platforms continue to evolve, it’s clear that the future of music streaming will go beyond passive listening. Instead, it will likely prioritize dynamic, personalized, [and social experiences](https://www.fastcompany.com/91145706/for-gen-z-music-is-its-own-social-media) that keep users more deeply connected to both the music and the platform itself.",
