  "text": "Good quality content in 2024 is pretty much reliant on two main things, great ideas and quality gear to capture it. Whilst there are some specialised pieces of equipment geared towards content creators from some relatively new names in audio, having an industry stalwart such as Shure in the content creator game is kind of a big deal and with it a sense of legitimacy, especially when it comes to the requirements of audio equipment in this particular corner of the market. Having released some pretty exciting gear over the past few years such as the MV7+podcasting mic and the MV6 USB gaming mic, Shure have been making serious strides in the content creator world with these products being quickly adopted by many, but the pro audio veterans aren’t stopping there. Catch up on all the latest music gear reviews [here.](https://mixdownmag.com.au/reviews/) Having been established in broadcast for decades, namely with the iconic SM7B being a mainstay in this sphere, it’s no surprise with the epic rise of podcasting and other varieties of online content that these mics alone can be spotted in the studio spaces of some of the biggest names in podcasting. Whilst this has secured the brand’s name in this space, for the countless creatives who don’t have the luxury of a dedicated studio space, let alone the budget for one let alone a handful of these microphones, the SM7B may not be the most suitable option. With so much content being created in various locations and audiences still expecting “studio quality” production value, more compact, elegant and quality audio solutions have become a priority for those creating on the move. Shure have certainly recognised this and their new line of MoveMic solutions speaks to this directly. Far from being a compact lavalier mic, the new MoveMic is a compact clip-on mic system which boasts high fidelity audio transmitted wirelessly, direct to a connected device. Coming in three options being the MoveMic One, MoveMic Two and MoveMic Two Receiver Kit, each option caters to a variety of users from the solo creator/instructor, through to interviewers/journalists or the full kit for videographers and higher production needs. Designed by the same team of engineers behind Shure’s legendary wireless microphone systems which are used day-in day-out by some of the world’s bigger touring artists, festivals, production houses and venues, these petite little microphones mean business. Providing the ability to capture 2-channels of audio at 48kHz via Bluetooth is pretty wild and being spec’d with a 30m range is particularly impressive for field recordings and on location shoots where the capture device, be it a connected phone, computer or the MoveMic receiver (which is cold shoe mountable for easy attachment to cameras) is set up a distance away from the mics. What’s more, MoveMic transmits via Bluetooth, making setup for an interview or video shoot incredibly fast, alleviating the need to work with and attach cumbersome transmitters, a massive plus. Capturing audio from the MoveMic is equally as convenient as it seems the Shure team have gone to lengths to make this system as streamlined and user friendly as possible being able to near instantly start recording directing to your phone via one of the ShurePlus MOTIV apps. But for those with existing gear, setups and associated apps, simply connecting the MoveMic receiver via the included 3.5mm cable to a camera or via USB-C to a phone or computer is equally as easy and simple to set up. MoveMic Two Receiver Kit In practice, the MoveMic Two Receiver Kit really is dead simple to use. Wanting to see the differences between the ShurePlus MOTIV apps, I downloaded both the audio and video apps. Both were a breeze to set up and use immediately, pairing with the mics straight away I was recording in no time. The presets available for speech and singers I found were a solid starting point, with the ability to quickly tweak settings further with convenient control over gain, high pass filter, EQ and compression. Having the mics connected to my phone to BlueTooth via the app there was some latency, as to be expected when monitoring with headphones, but this wasn’t a big deal and in reality when using these mics for the intended scenarios you’d typically just be checking monitoring for levels and tweaking a couple of settings before hitting record anyway. Both apps are well laid out, intuitive and incredibly easy to use, with clear indications for input level, metering, input monitoring and muting of the mics. The ability to custom name the connected mics both within the app and on the MoveMic receiver as well as the captured media is super useful too, helping keep track of things in editing and post. The noise reduction feature works really well, and as for the audio quality, it’s pretty damn impressive. Voice was incredibly clear and I didn’t find it was overly hyped or brittle sounding, but rather nicely isolated, crisp, detailed and polished, with little or no need for further processing. This neat mic kit is a game changer for content creators and for those needing an affordable high quality solution for their audio needs particularly for those creating content on the move need not look further. The convenient carry pouch makes the MoveMic Receiver Kit ideal for throwing in the backpack or production kit with all the included accessories being practical, well thought out and never feeling overdone. With a total of 24 hours record time available (8 hours per mic with 2 charges from the charging case) there’s very little the MoveMic Receiver Kit doesn’t cover, if only it could take care of editing your content too.
