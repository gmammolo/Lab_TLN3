  "text": "Home Business Broadband Broadband News Politics Alabama receives federal approval to deploy $1.4 billion broadband expansion plan By Grayson Everett October 17, 2024 Share Facebook Twitter Email (monsitj/iStock, YHN) Alabama’s $1.4 billion proposal to expand high-speed internet has been approved by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs (ADECA) proudly reported on Thursday.\nThe funding, which comes through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program, or BEAD, was initially announced in 2023. As part of the federal requirements, Alabama and the other states submitted proposals for deploying the BEAD funds to connect communities across Alabama with reliable high-speed internet access\nSince 2018, the state has invested more than $500 million in broadband infrastructure projects. Once completed, the over 200 projects are expected to connect an estimated 140,000 households, businesses, and community anchor institutions like schools and libraries.\nWith approval of the plan, ADECA says the state will begin launching the next phase. Alabama will open a process in 2025 to receive applications from internet service providers for projects targeting unserved households and businesses across all 67 counties. The funds will focus on “last-mile” projects that connect homes and businesses to service.\n“From the beginning, my goal to expand access to high-speed internet to every area of Alabama has been a team effort, and our plan to utilize these substantial BEAD funds to close the gap in broadband coverage is no different,” Governor Kay Ivey said.\n“ADECA, lawmakers, local leaders, and internet service providers each play a valuable role to ensure all of Alabama is connected. I commend all our partners in the approval of the plan and look forward to rolling out this funding in 2025.”\nRELATED: Be Linked Alabama: Interactive map lights up broadband growth\nADECA’s Alabama Digital Expansion Division is also managing funding from the American Rescue Plan Act and through the Alabama Broadband Accessibility Fund.\n“High-speed broadband internet access is key to the success of students, families, small businesses, and industries across our nation. With continued state-federal and public-private partnerships making strategic investments in closing the digital divide, more Alabamians will have the opportunity to achieve their American Dream,” U.S. Senator Katie Britt said.\n“I appreciate the leadership of Governor Ivey and ADECA in advancing this tailored plan for our state. I’ve always said we need to put Alabama first, and Governor Ivey is doing just that. I look forward to seeing how increased connectivity elevates our state and our communities long into the future.”\nThe funds are focused on permanent fiber infrastructure, for which the federal BEAD program prioritizes funding. Alabama’s broadband expansion strategy has also prioritized fiber-optic networks to ensure the infrastructure not only meets current needs, but also serves communities well into the future.\nGrayson Everett is the state and political editor for Yellowhammer News.
