  "text": "by Cristina Rojas October 17th 2024 Share Facebook Twitter Portland State is among the newest members of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR).UCAR, which manages the federally funded National Center for Atmospheric Research, is a nonprofit consortium of 131 colleges and universities focused on research and training in Earth system science.Members, who represent virtually all the major Earth system science education programs in North America, guide UCAR’s overall direction, ensuring they meet the most urgent needs of the research and education community. PSU now has a seat at the table to elect trustees and serve on a number of governance and advisory committees.Paul Loikith, an associate professor of geography and director of PSU’s Climate Science Lab, says PSU’s inclusion is exciting.“This recognizes PSU's contribution to Earth system science education and research,” he said. “It opens up some funding opportunities as well as educational opportunities for students, including internships and visits from scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.”PSU joins McMaster University, Tuskegee University, University of California, Riverside, and University of California, Santa Barbara, as UCAR’s newest member institutions.
