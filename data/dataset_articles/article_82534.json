  "text": "October's Hunter's Moon appeared at its peak on Thursday night, in what was the closest supermoon to Earth this year. Plenty of Australian star-gazers enjoyed the sight, including these ones at North Bondi in Sydney's east. The supermoon at Bondi loomed at its largest just before 10.30pm on Thursday. The glowigng orb was also seen across all other states and territories. Coming in the lead-up to Halloween, the supermoon provided extra spookiness in London. It provided a glowing backdrop for the Halloween light trail at Kew Gardens in the British capital. These two Japanese students enjoyed watching the event from a bench on the banks of the Sumida River in Tokyo. They looked on as the supermoon shone behind the Tokyo Skytree in the Japanese city. A spider web was silhouetted against a supermoon in the northern Indian town of Dharamshala. This girl played on the outskirts of Srinagar, in Kashmir as the supermoon rose behind the Zabarwan hills. Berlin residents watched as the supermoon appeared next to the German capital's massive television tower. And it helped illuminate another Berlin icon, the famous Brandenburg Gate. Astronomical observatories were the place to be for many star-gazers. Here at the Jakarta planetarium, Indonesians got a chance for a close-up view through a telescope. This full moon is considered the third of four consecutive supermoons expected this year, the US space agency NASA says. It's show here rising beyond buildings in Kansas City in the US Mid West. Elsewhere in the US, the supermoon coincided with the Texas State Fair in Dallas. Patrons watched it rise next to a giant Big Tex sign. A flock of birds fly in front of the full moon over the city centre in Tallinn, in the Baltic state of Estonia. The supermoon was shrouded by cloud over Beirut, the capital of Lebanon. While many people associate the Hunter's Moon with being orange in colour, it appeared a shade of gold when it rose behind the Camlica mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. The famous Shwedagon Pagoda in Thadingyut, Myanmar, was illuminated by the supermoon. The lunar event came at the end Buddhist Lent.",
