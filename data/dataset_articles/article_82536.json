  "text": "[LUCID Launches Triton2 EVS Event-Based 2.5GigE Camera ] The IMX636 and IMX637 sensors combine Sony’s CMOS image sensor technology with Prophesee’s unique event-based Metavision® sensing technologies. With these event-based vision sensors, individual pixels trigger events in response to changes in luminance. Each event contains pixel coordinates and a microsecond-resolution timestamp, making them distinct from traditional frame-based cameras. Richmond, BC, Canada - October 17, 2024 - LUCID Vision Labs, Inc., a leading designer and manufacturer of industrial cameras, today announced the launch of the new Triton2 EVS event-based 2.5GigE camera, featuring the IMX636 and IMX637 event-based vision sensors, realized in collaboration between Sony and Prophesee. \"Event-based vision opens up new industrial applications by significantly improving performance, lowering power consumption, and providing a more flexible solution for machine vision applications such as motion analysis, vibration monitoring, object tracking, optical flow, autonomous driving, and high-speed detection,\" says Rod Barman, Founder and President of LUCID Vision Labs. \"With the launch of the new Triton2 EVS event-based camera, we're expanding our advanced sensing technologies and are excited about the potential it brings to a wider range of industrial applications.\" \"We've established a very productive relationship with LUCID to enable the full potential of our event-based sensors in their high-performance machine vision systems,\" said Luca Verre co-founder and CEO of Prophesee. \"The Triton2 EVS camera showcases the exceptional performance, efficiency, and usability of our technology. We're very proud of helping enable a new era of high-speed, low-latency vision solutions that significantly enhance productivity, accuracy, and versatility for a range of industrial applications.\" The Triton2's Factory Tough™ design offers IP67 protection, Power over Ethernet (PoE) and provides protection against shock, vibration, water, dust, and electromagnetic interference. It features Active Sensor Alignment for superior optical performance, a compact 44 x 29 mm form factor, M12 Ethernet and M8 general purpose I/O connectors for a robust connection, industrial EMC immunity and a wide ambient temperature range of -20°C to 50°C. Designed for seamless integration, the 2.5GBASE-T Triton2 enables rapid data transfer rates of 300 MB/s and supports standard CAT5e and CAT6 cables up to 100 meters. The Triton2 EVS camera is compatible with LUCID's own Arena® SDK and Prophesee's Metavision® SDK. The Triton2 EVS TRT009S-EC and TRT003S-EC models are now available for order.
