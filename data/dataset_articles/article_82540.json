  "text": "Publisher WhisperGames and developer KEIZO have officially released ASTLIBRA Gaiden: The Cave of Phantom Mist will be released for Nintendo Switch on October 17, 2024.\nThis DLC for the original game was released for PC via Steam in February, but this Switch version will be a standalone purchase that does not require one to own the original game.\nSTLIBRA Gaiden: The Cave of Phantom Mist is an additional side story to ASTLIBRA featuring a fresh protagonist in a roguelike-style adventure. In this expansion, players take control of the baker’s daughter, who steps out of her reclusive life to rescue her town’s missing Guild members after they disappear, leaving her with no choice but to fight in order to save her ill sister. The side story introduces more than 20 hours of gameplay in procedurally generated dungeons where players face dynamic challenges.\nThe game offers multiple ways to strengthen the new protagonist, such as skill upgrades, gear selection, and a focus on magic-based combat abilities. Players will use this new magic to defeat enemies and push through the game’s randomly generated dungeons. The game’s side-scrolling action, familiar to fans of classic JRPGs, combines slashing and smashing enemies while building stamina for Possession Skills. These devastating skills play a key role in facing enormous bosses that dominate the screen, each requiring strategic thinking and upgrades to be defeated.\nThe narrative unfolds around the young protagonist as she ventures beyond her usual life of sweeping in front of her family’s bakery, driven by love for her sister and newfound bravery. As with the core game, the side story maintains the charm of ASTLIBRA ‘s retro-inspired combat and progression mechanics.\nIf you want to learn more about ASTLIBRA Revision , check out our reviews of the base game and the Gaiden DLC .",
