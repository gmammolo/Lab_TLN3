  "text": "CORSAIR has unveiled its latest innovation in PC cooling with the new iCUE LINK RX MAX Fan Serie s , offering powerful airflow and quieter operation. Announced on October 17, 2024 , these 30mm-thick fans are designed to improve cooling performance across both 120mm and 140mm sizes, available with or without RGB lighting. The fans promise enhanced static pressure and superior cooling efficiency, thanks to their thicker design and advanced features.\nEnhanced Performance for High-End Cooling Needs\nThe iCUE LINK RX MAX fans are 20% thicker than standard 25mm fans, allowing them to move more air at slower speeds while reducing noise levels. The RX120 MAX model operates between 400 and 2,000 RPM with an impressive 4.2mm-H2O static pressure , making it ideal for pushing air through dense radiators. The RX140 MAX runs at 300 to 1,600 RPM with 2.4mm-H2O static pressure , providing strong cooling for a variety of high-performance components.\nCORSAIR has also integrated AirGuide Technology into the design, focusing airflow precisely where it’s needed most. This enhances both cooling efficiency and overall performance, ensuring that high-end gaming PCs and workstations maintain optimal temperatures even under heavy workloads.\nDurability Meets Silent Operation\nThe Magnetic Dome bearing in the RX MAX fans ensures long-lasting performance while minimizing noise. Whether opting for the non-RGB or RGB variants, all fans come equipped with built-in temperature sensors, allowing users to customize their cooling profiles through iCUE software . This level of control enables precise fan curves, offering a perfect balance between cooling efficiency and noise reduction.\nSleek Design with RGB Options\nThe iCUE LINK RX MAX fans are available in both black and white for the RGB models, allowing users to match their aesthetic preferences. The non-RGB models come in black only, providing a sleek, understated look for those focused purely on performance. Each RGB-enabled fan features eight RGB LEDs and a built-in side window, offering users even more visual customization options for their setups. With CORSAIR’s iCUE LINK technology , multiple fans can be easily connected and managed through a single hub, simplifying the installation process.\nSingle-Cable Installation with Starter Kits\nThe fans are available as single units or as part of a Starter Kit , which includes either three 120mm fans or two 140mm fans along with the iCUE LINK Hub . This all-in-one solution provides users with a tidy, single-cable installation, reducing clutter and improving cable management in even the most complex PC builds.\nAvailability and Pricing\nThe CORSAIR iCUE LINK RX MAX Fan Series is available now through the CORSAIR webstore and authorized retailers worldwide. All models are backed by a five-year warranty and come with CORSAIR’s renowned customer service and technical support. For detailed pricing, visit the CORSAIR website or contact your local CORSAIR sales representative.",
