We can’t wait to share it with the world in 2025.”\nSet in a twisted time-travel narrative, Cronos: The New Dawn takes players to an unforgiving post-apocalyptic future in 1980s Poland. You assume the role of a Traveler , an agent of the enigmatic Collective , tasked with extracting selected individuals who didn’t survive the apocalypse from the past.\nTo fulfill the Collective’s mission, players must navigate a deadly wasteland created by a cataclysmic event known as the Change . The environment is filled with monstrous abominations that will test combat abilities and survival skills.\nWe’ll keep you updated on the development of Cronos: The New Dawn.",
