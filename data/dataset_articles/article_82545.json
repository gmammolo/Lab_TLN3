  "text": "Coastal ecosystems are being targeted by eyes in the sky as part of an ongoing effort to monitor and protect, seagrasses, saltmarshes and mangroves across the state's estuaries. NSW Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) Fisheries Research Scientist Dr Daniel Swadling said the state-wide mapping project is using drones to capture images of these challenging environments. \"Accessing remote saltmarsh and mangrove areas is no easy task, due to the challenging environments. Some sites are so remote that they can't be accessed by boat or 4WD,\" Dr Swadling said. \"By using drone technology, the team can capture high-resolution phot ographs of these areas which is crucial for tracking changes in these habitats and assessing their overall condition. \"These images are then compared to preliminary maps created from aerial imagery, a process known as validation, which helps ensure the accuracy of the habitat data.\" Dr Swadling said a recent mapping expedition in the Clarence River demonstrated the benefits of blending technology with the natural habitat. \"Because of the difficulty in accessing some of these areas, we were able to obtain 'Extended Visual Line of Sight' (EVLOS) endorsements. This approval allows drone pilots to fly beyond the usual visual line of sight. With EVLOS, we could photograph areas up to 1.5 kilometres away, well beyond standard drone operating limits,\" Dr Swadling said. \"Mapping estuarine habitats is a key component of the Marine Estate Management Strategy (MEMS) and vital for safeguarding the future of NSW's estuaries by providing data to protect these ecosystems for future generations.\" The NSW Estuarine Habitat Monitoring and Threat Assessment Project is conducted by DPIRD Fisheries and funded via the NSW Marine Estate Management Strategy. An updated map of the Clarence River estuary will soon be available to the public via the Estuarine Habitat Dashboard and Fisheries Spatial Data Portal .
