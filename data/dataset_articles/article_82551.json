  "text": "In his opening remarks, Dr Michael emphasised the importance of collaboration with all sectors when mainstreaming biodiversity.\n“ Mainstreaming biodiversity requires collective efforts and increased collaboration from all sectors of society—state actors, the private sector, civil society, indigenous peoples, and citizens. This integrated approach is essential for the success of biodiversity conservation and restoration .”, said Dr Sivendra Michael, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change.\nDelivering her remarks, Ms. Elodie Vitalis, Head of the AFD office in Fiji highlighted the critical role of biodiversity in combating global environmental challenges. AFD is leading efforts to fund and implement France’s official development assistance through loans, grants, and knowledge-sharing. In the Pacific, its focus remains on biodiversity conservation and climate change.\n“ Our ambition at AFD is to align sectoral greening policies with national biodiversity strategies ,” said Ms. Elodie Vitalis, Head of the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) office in Fiji. “ We aim to generate projects that not only attract funding from AFD and other donors but also provide tangible benefits to communities and ecosystems alike. The BIODEV2030 initiative directly supports AFD’s goal of reaching €1 billion in co-benefits and co-funding for biodiversity by 2025 .”\nPhase I of the BIODEV2030 project laid a strong foundation, with significant achievements made in securing voluntary biodiversity commitments from stakeholders in the kava sector of Cakaudrove Province. Moving into Phase II, the focus will expand to include sustainable exploitation of marine and inland fisheries, as well as the continued development of the kava sector.\nThe Ministry of Environment, in its role as the focal point for the Convention on Biological Diversity, has been integral to the success of Phase I, alongside the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Ministry of Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry of Forestry, all of whom continue to support biodiversity integration across sectors.\nH.E Ms. Julie Le Saos, Ambassador of France to the Republic of Fiji reiterated the commitment made by the Government of France towards the phase II of the BIODEV2030 project.\n“ In light of this positive results, and two weeks before COP16 on Biodiversity in Cali, Colombia, I am happy to say that France’s political commitment is to renew its support to the project in its second Phase, which will focus on territorial-level action and working on sectorial policies that impact biodiversity .”, said H.E Ms. Julie Le Saos, Ambassador of France to the Republic of Fiji\nPhase II will emphasise policy reforms to better integrate biodiversity into public policy and promote sustainable coastal fisheries. It aims to foster competitive and inclusive industries while maintaining ecosystem protection.\nThe launch also highlighted the importance of adopting a Talanoa spirit, encouraging open dialogue and collaborative solutions to ensure that biodiversity is prioritized in funding and policy decisions.\nIn conjunction with the launch, a video was presented that showcased the accomplishments of Phase I in the Cakaudrove Province and also outlined the plans for Phase II. Later in the day, a national workshop brought together stakeholders from the kava and fisheries sectors. This workshop aimed to support reforms in sectoral policies to enhance biodiversity conservation.\nParticipants endorsed a Charter of Principles for effective multi-stakeholder engagement, ensuring that all voices are heard, and mutual respect is maintained. Additionally, the workshop facilitated discussions on public policy instruments relevant to agriculture and coastal fisheries, focusing on strategies to amend practices that negatively impact biodiversity.\nImplemented by IUCN and WWF France, coordinated by Expertise France and financed by AFD, the BIODEV2030 project is a key initiative designed to support the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework across 15 countries, with Fiji standing proudly as the only participating Pacific nation. This event comes just two weeks ahead of the COP 16 Biodiversity conference in Colombia, positioning Fiji at the forefront of regional biodiversity conservation efforts.\nThe BIODEV2030 project is a testament to Fiji's leadership in biodiversity conservation and sustainable development, creating a resilient environment for future generations.",
