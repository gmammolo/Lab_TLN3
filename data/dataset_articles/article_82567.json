  "text": "Key Takeaways - Subnautica 2 was announced at the Xbox Partner Preview. - Early access is coming via Xbox in early 2025. - It will be a singleplayer-focused experience with the option for 4-player multiplayer. Subnautica 2, the follow-up to Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero, was announced at today's Xbox Partner Preview with a cinematic trailer. The game will be entering early access via the Xbox Game Preview program in early 2025 and will be available on Game Pass on day one. In Subnautica 2, you'll be able to play with up to four players in cooperative multiplayer. According to an article by Unknown Worlds Entertainment's community manager Donya Abramo on Xbox Wire , Subnautica 2 will take place in a setting \"beyond Planet 4546B\" and allow you to \"explore lush new environments, encounter fascinating creatures around every corner, and uncover the secrets at the core of this mysterious planet.\" A Return To The Deep \"As we build up to the release of Subnautica 2 (Game Preview) in 2025, we'll be sharing even more about what to expect from the game. From new and improved tools, vehicles, and base building, to a whole host of creatures big and small, the likes of which have never been seen before!\" the post reads. Unknown Worlds had previously announced that early access may be coming in 2024, but we now know for sure that we'll be able to head back into the depths early next year. There had been murmurings that Subnautica 2 would be a live-service title , but Krafton clarified that this wasn't the case and that the game would be \"singleplayer-focused with a co-op mode\" with additional content scheduled to arrive post-release, but not traditional live-service elements. According to an internal document, the sequel is also leaving behind the Unity engine in favour of Unreal Engine 5, but that wasn't touched upon in today's announcement. The original Subnautica was released in 2014 and became an indie darling as players enjoyed a fresh take on the survival crafting genre. Unknown Worlds followed up Subnautica with a spin-off, Subnautica: Below Zero in 2019. Below Zero would add more land-based areas to explore, a switch-up from its predecessor. Subnautica 2 is set for release at an unknown date in \"early 2025.\" A survivor of a crash onto a large, oceanic planet, Subnautica sees you try to survive. You must gather materials you need to explore, build a base, and figure out the planet's past.",
