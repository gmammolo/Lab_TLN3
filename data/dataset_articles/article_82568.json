  "text": "Silent Hill 2 Remake and The Medium developer Bloober Team has announced a brand-new third-person survival horror game called Cronos: The New Dawn, launching next year for Xbox Series X/S and PC.

As the name suggests, Cronos is a \"twisted time travel story\". In the reveal during the Xbox Partner Preview, we saw a strange astronaut-styled character sitting with an old woman in her home, playing chess, interspersed with clips of the strange spaceman exploring a trippy rundown future while fighting Necromorph-like enemies. Details are scarce right now about what we can expect, but the YouTube description tells us that it's \"Set in a grim world where Eastern European brutalism meets retro-futurist technology\". We got a very brief snippet of gameplay right at the end of the trailer, showing the player walking through ruins at night with corpses sprouting from the rubble, but it cuts to black right before an encounter with one of the enemies. Screenshots on the Steam page give us a bit more to chew on, with a strange pod illuminated in red, a swirling orange storm in the sky above crumbling buildings playing fast and loose with the laws of gravity, and the player in a metro car aiming at one of the strange, humanoid monsters. It all looks very Dead Space . Cronus in Greek mythology is the Titan leader and father to Zeus, while Chronos is the Greek god of time. Bloober's new game appears to be taking inspiration from both legends. Bloober Team is coming hot off the press with the Silent Hill 2 remake, which sold a staggering one million copies in just three days . Despite trepadation surrounding the remake, given Bloober's less favourable recent releases like Layers of Fears, it was a major hit with reviewers, garnering an aggregate score of 87 on OpenCritic . Fingers crossed Cronos is more Silent Hill 2 Remake than Blair Witch, eh? You can wishlist Cronos: The New Dawn here .",
