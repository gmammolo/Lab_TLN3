  "text": "by Tanya Gazdik , 62 minutes ago\nPrada and commercial space company Axiom Space are partnering on what might be the most stylish spacesuit ever.\n“Unveiled during the International Astronautical Congress in Milan on Wednesday, the mostly white suits feature a cropped torso and stone-gray patches across the elbows and knees,” according to CNN Style . “Although conspicuously free of branding or logos, the designs do include red accent lines across the forearms, waist and ‘portable life system backpacks,’ which nod to Prada’s sub-brand, Linea Rossa.”\nThe new suit will be worn for NASA’s Artemis III moon mission in 2026, marking the first return to the moon by a human since 1972.\n“The modernized suits are meant foremost to keep astronauts safe in the throes of space’s harsh environment, with improved mobility from earlier designs as a close second mandate,” according to NPR . “The suit is one size fits all and includes lights, an HD camera, 4G/LTE communications, and in-suit nutrition.”\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nPrada reached out to Axiom, which had just bid for the NASA contract, several years ago. This isn’t the first time the fashion world and space have overlapped.\n“Past Prada employees who worked on Linea Rossa have moved on to jobs at SpaceX and Boeing,” according to The New York Times . “At the same time, the brand’s expertise in crafting made-to-order, personalized garments proved to be an asset when crafting made-to-order, personalized spacesuits.”\nThe stylish suits will be worn by the first woman on the moon and the first person of color, according to Vogue .\n\"We are witnessing the beginning of a new era, as the internet was in the 1980s,\" said Lorenzo Bertelli, chief marketing officer of Prada, according to Wired . \"Today access to space is still something for the few, but just as in computing, in a few years prices will come down. Everyone should indulge in the beauty of an adventure.\"",
