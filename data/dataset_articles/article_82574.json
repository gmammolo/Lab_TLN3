  "text": "As I have said in the past, I’m a big fan of the Elevation Lab AirTag accessories . In my experience, they are easily the best and put most of those cheapie plastic models to shame. That might suggest we are talking bout a bunch of overpriced premium solutions here, but, while they might be a touch more than the bargain bin options out there, they are very much not. We are talking about nearly indestructible AirTag mounts, many of which completely waterproof, in the $9 and $10 range when they are on sale like they are today. So be sure to head below and have at them while we are seeing up to 20% price drops across the lineup. Here are some of our favorite models that are seeing price drops right now: - TagVault AirTag Cat Collar Mount $10 (Reg. $13) - TagVault AirTag Wallet Holder $9 (Reg. $10) - TagVault AirTag Magnetic Case from $15 (Reg. $18+) - TagVault Fabric Mount from $13 (Reg. $14+) - TagVault Bike v2 $30 (Reg. $35) - TagVault Adhesive Surface https://amzn.to/3yxVeB0 - TagVault Pet $16 (Reg. $20) - 4-pack Orignal Waterproof TagVault $26.50 (Reg. $37) - And even more … And here are some of the brand’s latest speciality releases designed for particular use case scenarios – magnetic, safety pin-style, specifically for bag straps, and so on: Elevation Lab debuts new lockable AirTag Security Mount with key starting Elevation Lab TagVault Dual Pin Discreet – an AirTag holder for bags, clothes, and more Keep your living room lions secure with Elevation Lab’s new AirTag cat collar mount Elevation Lab debuts its ‘first’ leather custom snap-closure AirTag wallet mount Elevation Lab intros new AirTag safety pin mounts with launch deals ElevationLab intros new hidden TagVault Mountain Bike AirTag holder TagVault Adhesive Surface features: - The indestructible AirTag surface mount. - Installs in seconds with premium 3M VHB adhesive. - Holds extremely strong to clean & flat surfaces (alcohol pad included).
