  "text": "The original CRKD Nitro Deck took the Switch world by storm a couple years ago now as one of, if not, the best handheld controller alternatives on the market. While you can still score the perfectly capable original model on Amazon down at $50, earlier this CRKD released a new updated and enhanced model known as the Nitro Deck+ and we are now tracking the first chance to save on it via Amazon. Head below for the discounted pricing and more details on the upgrades.\nCRKD Nitro Deck+ deals:\n***Note: Be sure to clip the on-page coupons. These deals come courtesy of trusted Amazon seller Freemode Go – a storefront that has been serving up official deals on Nitro Decks for well over a year.\n- CRKD Nitro Deck+\n$63 (Reg. $70)- Clear white and clear black\n- CRKD Nitro Deck+\n$72 (Reg. $70)- With included HDMI Adapter\n- Clear white and clear black\nWhile the original Nitro Deck is still a great Switch controller, complete with swappable thumbstick toppers, re-mappable back buttons, and “zero stick drift” Hall Effect action, the Nitro Deck+ includes all of that and takes it up a notch from there.\nAs detailed in our launch coverage of the new plus model, some of the highlight enhancements here include a symmetrical thumbstick layout, fully programmable Sidekick buttons, and an HDMI adapter allowing you to play in Docked Mode while connected to a TV.”\nGet a complete rundown of what’s new right here.\nNitro Deck+ handheld Switch controller features:\nThe Nitro Deck+ handheld pro controller for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch OLED Model has Hall Effect Sensor thumbsticks and Triggers which offers no stick drift and precise controls, enhancing the longevity of your controller while elevating your gaming experience on Nintendo Switch. Now with “Pro style” symmetrical thumbstick layout for enhanced comfort. Program your Nitro Deck+ back buttons, or your brand new “side kicks” how you wish.
