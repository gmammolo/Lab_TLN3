  "text": "Tonix Pharmaceuticals Receives First Contract Payment from U.S. Department of Defense for Accelerated Development of Broad-Spectrum Antivirals with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Tonix Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: TNXP) has received its first payment from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) under a contract worth up to $34 million over five years. The funding aims to develop broad-spectrum antiviral agents for protecting military personnel in biological threat environments. This non-dilutive funding supports Tonix's ongoing research to advance its antiviral discovery program. The contract will accelerate the development of Tonix's broad-spectrum antiviral program, focusing on phosphatase inhibitors targeting CD45. The company plans to optimize lead compounds for therapeutic intervention against biothreat agents. Tonix will utilize its research facilities, including a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) lab at its research and development center in Frederick, Md., to carry out this work. - Secured a contract worth up to $34 million over five years from the U.S. Department of Defense - Received first payment under the DTRA contract, providing non-dilutive funding - Validation of Tonix's antiviral discovery program by a government agency - Access to state-of-the-art research facilities, including a BSL-3 lab, for project execution - None. Insights The The focus on broad-spectrum antivirals for military personnel has dual-use potential, with applications in both defense and civilian markets. The CD45 inhibitor approach is innovative, aiming to balance antiviral efficacy with safety. If successful, this could lead to a valuable pipeline asset. Tonix's BSL-3 lab and strategic location near the U.S. biodefense research hub are strong assets, potentially facilitating future collaborations and contracts. However, investors should note that drug development is inherently risky and success is not guaranteed despite government backing. This contract signifies the DoD's increasing focus on biodefense, reflecting growing concerns about biological threats in military operations. The The contract's structure, with milestone-based payments, aligns well with the drug development process. It reduces financial risk for Tonix while allowing the DoD to monitor progress closely. The potential for a broad-spectrum antiviral is particularly valuable for military applications, where rapid response to unknown pathogens is critical. If successful, this project could position Tonix as a key player in the biodefense sector, potentially leading to additional government contracts. However, the highly specialized nature of this work may limit immediate commercial applications outside of government use. First payment received under Tonix’s contract with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), for up to CHATHAM, N.J., Oct. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. (Nasdaq: TNXP) (Tonix or the Company), a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company with marketed products and a pipeline of development candidates, received its first payment from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), an agency within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), to develop small molecule broad-spectrum antiviral agents for the prevention or treatment of infections to improve the medical readiness of military personnel in biological threat environments. The previously announced award from DTRA is for up to “This award provides important validation and substantial non-dilutive funding for our ongoing research to advance our antiviral discovery program,” said Seth Lederman, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Tonix Pharmaceuticals “With biological adaptations and mutations happening to viruses rapidly across the globe, this research will be crucial in order to protect lives in the event biological threats are introduced onto the battlefield.” The Tonix will utilize its state-of-the-art research laboratory capabilities, including a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) lab at its research and development center (RDC) facility located in Frederick, Md., as well as experienced personnel in-house. The RDC is located in Maryland’s ‘I-270 biotech corridor’ and is close to the center of the U.S. biodefense research community.
