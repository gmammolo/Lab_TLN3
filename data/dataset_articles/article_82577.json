  "text": "Seabourn, renowned for its ultra-luxury voyages and expedition travel, has made a groundbreaking discovery during a submarine dive near Alejandro Selkirk Island in Chile’s Juan Fernández Archipelago. On October 14, 2024, the Seabourn Pursuit, the brand’s latest purpose-built expedition vessel, uncovered the long-lost Titania, a German supply ship that had been missing for 110 years. Resting 95 meters beneath the ocean’s surface, this astonishing find marks the first sighting of the Titania since it was deliberately sunk in 1914.\n“Experiences like these are a testament to the spirit of expedition, and this discovery is nothing short of historic,” said Robin West, vice president and general manager of expeditions at Seabourn. “Seabourn’s expeditions and particularly our submarine explorations often take our guests to places where no other human has ever explored. I am so incredibly proud of our expedition team for delivering this once-in-a-lifetime and truly unforgettable ‘Seabourn Moment’ to our guests and the local community on Selkirk Island.”\nThe discovery of the Titania was made possible by the submarine team’s dedicated research and close collaboration with local communities, creating a truly one-of-a-kind experience for guests. Led by Submarine Pilot Mauricio Fernandez, the team—comprised of Kieran Buckley, Henrik Enckell, and Isaac Yebra—partnered with local fisherman Gino Perez, who had long heard tales about the Titania’s possible location. Perez joined the dive, assisting the team in pinpointing the suspected wreck site. Under ideal weather conditions, the team uncovered the Titania 95 meters below the surface, roughly 4.25 nautical miles off Selkirk’s northwest coast. Following the discovery, the island’s harbor master confirmed that no previous diver or submarine had ever explored the wreck.\nFernandez shared how the emotion in the submarine was palpable. “We were there witnessing history, and our guests had the chance to be a part of this discovery of Titania and the first to see this ship after she sank to the bottom of the ocean 110 years ago. This was truly a special moment of discovery and a perfect example of how Seabourn expeditions continue to provide our guests with incredible Seabourn Moments throughout each journey.”\nGuests described the feeling when they saw Titania for the first time: “It was almost magical. It really was quite extraordinary,” said Irene Blum, a guest who was in the submarine during the discovery.\nIt was particularly emotional for Perez, who shared, “I imagined this ship so many times and now I can see where she is, how she looks like and how she is resting at the bottom. Thank you so much, my father manages this sector of the island, this means a lot to us and our family history. This is extraordinary.”\nThe Titania was deliberately scuttled on November 19, 1914, and stories of the wreck have been passed down through generations. Although fishermen occasionally found metal fragments in their lobster traps, believed to be from the vessel, the wreck’s exact location had remained undiscovered until now.\nUnveiling the South Pacific: Seabourn Pursuit’s Extraordinary Itineraries\nDuring one of Seabourn Pursuit’s remarkable South Pacific voyages, a historic discovery was made, further enhancing the allure of these adventurous journeys. Spanning over 4,000 miles, these itineraries take guests on an exploration of the rich and remote regions of Melanesia, French Polynesia, and San Antonio, Chile. Along the way, passengers have the unique opportunity to explore some of the world’s most isolated treasures, such as the Juan Fernandez Archipelago off Chile’s coast, spend time on the enigmatic Easter Island, visit the volcanic Pitcairn Islands, and venture into the remote Yasawa Islands of Fiji.\nBuilding on the success of these thrilling adventures, Seabourn Pursuit is set to offer similar deployments in 2025, featuring four exclusive voyages. These include two 20-day journeys, one departing from San Antonio, Chile to Papeete, Tahiti on March 18, 2025, and another from Papeete to San Antonio on October 10, 2025. Additionally, an 18-day voyage from Papeete to Sydney is scheduled to depart on April 7, 2025, and a 16-day Remote Shores of New Guinea & Indonesia voyage will set sail from Sydney to Darwin on April 24, 2025.\nUnforgettable Submarine Adventures with Seabourn\nA highlight of Seabourn Pursuit’s expeditions is the opportunity to embark on unforgettable submarine experiences. Both Seabourn Pursuit and its sister ship, Seabourn Venture, are equipped with two custom-built, state-of-the-art submarines designed to offer guests an extraordinary perspective beneath the ocean’s surface. These submarines allow for a once-in-a-lifetime exploration of surreal underwater landscapes, from the icy depths of Antarctic waters to the vibrant, marine life-filled reefs in tropical seas.\nIn select destinations, guests can dive into unexplored locations, possibly being among the first humans to set eyes on these hidden realms. Seated in two clear acrylic spheres, flanking the pilot’s station, passengers enjoy an awe-inspiring view with virtually undistorted sightlines in every direction. Each sphere contains three passenger seats mounted on a rotating platform, allowing for the best possible viewing experience.\nSubmarine dives are offered on select itineraries, including Seabourn Pursuit’s South Pacific sailings from March through October 2025, and are available for an additional charge. Operated by highly trained pilots, Seabourn’s submarines are built to the highest safety standards, certified by Lloyd’s Register and undergoing annual external inspections. These advanced submarines are designed with multiple safety features, including a safety buoy and a maximum diving depth of 300 meters (less than 1,000 feet). Throughout each dive, a surface boat remains in constant communication with the submarine, ensuring a safe and seamless experience.\nA New Level of Adventure Awaits\nWith its upcoming 2025 voyages and unparalleled submarine explorations, Seabourn Pursuit offers guests the ultimate opportunity to experience the wonders of the South Pacific like never before. Whether discovering historic shipwrecks or witnessing the vibrant marine life in untouched underwater worlds, Seabourn continues to set the standard for ultra-luxury adventure travel, providing guests with experiences they will treasure for a lifetime.",
