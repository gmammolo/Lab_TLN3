  "text": "Subaru has shared more details of its new Strong Hybrid (S:HEV) system, which promises more power, greater range and improved fuel economy than its existing hybrid system.\\n\\nThe next-generation Forester, due in Australia in 2025, had already been confirmed to get the S:HEV powertrain.\\n\\nNow, Subaru in Japan has confirmed a S:HEV version of the Crosstrek, which will launch there in December 2024.\\n\\nThe S:HEV powertrain uses technology from hybrid leader Toyota.\\n\\n100s of new car deals are available through CarExpert right now. Get the experts on your side and score a great deal. Browse now.\\n\\n“Our focus is initially introducing this next-generation hybrid technology to Australians with the new generation Forester in 2025,” a spokesperson for Subaru Australia told CarExpert.\\n\\n“However, we are always looking at enhancing the Subaru product offerings and expanding choices for our Australian customers.”\\n\\nSubaru says the Crosstrek S:HEV will use a 2.5-litre Boxer four-cylinder engine – up from a 2.0-litre in the brand’s current hybrids – paired with a series-parallel hybrid system and symmetrical all-wheel drive.\\n\\nThe Crosstrek S:HEV will offer a claimed 1000km of range per tank.\\n\\nNext-generation Forester\\n\\nUp front there’s a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster with hybrid-specific readouts, while in the back there’s a 100V/1500W power outlet allowing you to power external appliances.\\n\\nAutomotive News shared some more details on the S:HEV powertrain, which is claimed to deliver 50 per cent more driving range and a 20 per cent improvement in fuel economy.\\n\\nThe larger engine produces 116kW of power. It’s mated to an 88kW electric motor and a 1kWh/260V battery, up from 0.6kWh/188V.\\n\\nThe current Forester Hybrid’s electric motor produces just 12kW and 66Nm, while its 2.0-litre engine produces 100kW and 196Nm.\\n\\nNo combined system power or torque figure is available for the new S:HEV powertrain, but Subaru claims it shaves 2.1 seconds off the 0-100km/h time.\\n\\nThe longer range is also aided through the use of a larger 64L fuel tank, up from 49L.\\n\\nFor context, the outgoing Forester Hybrid uses a claimed 6.7L/100km on the combined cycle, just 0.7L/100km more than the 2.5-litre petrol-powered model and well adrift of the 4.7L-4.8L/100km claims of the rival Toyota RAV4 Hybrid.\\n\\nWhile Subaru’s hybrids can’t match class-leaders for economy, the brand said earlier this year it’s working to increase supply of its electrified models in Australia, noting demand for the Forester Hybrid has been growing.\\n\\nMORE: Everything Subaru ForesterMORE: Everything Subaru Crosstrek",
