  "text": "Quick Links\nFor those with mobility disabilities, traveling can be far more challenging than one might expect, as there are very few industry tools available that allow one to understand what aircraft may be able to accommodate wheelchairs and mobility devices. United Airlines, however, attempted to address many of these challenges when it launched its wheelchair sizing tool earlier this year, hoping to expand accessibility by providing passengers with a quick way to understand which aircraft will be able to fit their mobility devices.\nGet all the latest\n[aviation news](/tag/aviation-news/)\nfrom Simple Flying! For months now, United Airlines passengers have been able to examine whether their wheelchairs will be able to fit onboard an aircraft they are going to fly on during the booking process, providing them with a simple way to explore their accessibility options. As expected, the new system has significantly improved the travel experience for those who require mobility accommodations, as per the latest data released by United.\nAccording to statistics from the airline, more than 20,000 customers have already used the industry-leading tool since it was launched towards the end of April 2024. The carrier has also been able to incorporate the results of dozens of feedback surveys, allowing it to improve its customer satisfaction ratings by nearly 4%.\nA new strategic partnership\nUnited also announced today that it would be launching a new collaboration with the United Spinal Association, hoping that the organization will be able to leverage its expertise to\nbest support the carrier with its accessibility initiatives. United's leadership team has been quick to note its excitement following today's announcement, with Dan Kinzelman, the carrier's Chief Commercial Officer, sharing the following words:\n\"The early success of our digital sizing tool is an encouraging development in our ongoing efforts to find more ways to improve the travel experience for customers of all abilities.\"\nThe executive also added his excitement about United's new collaboration with the United Spinal Association, praising the organization's ability to develop impactful solutions. Furthermore, Kinzelman indicated that he looked forward to utilizing the valuable feedback to better meet the needs of United customers.\nThe carrier's new wheelchair tool was also introduced alongside a new policy that allowed customers to seek a refund if they were forced to pay for a more expensive flight to accommodate their wheelchair. Other recent United accessibility initiatives include all the following:\n- Providing ramp agents with mobile technology that allows them to follow specific instructions for loading wheelchairs\n- The airline was the first US carrier to add Braille to aircraft interiors\n- United seatback screens feature an array of accessibility features, including closed captions\nThe United Spinal Association is equally excited by the launch of this new partnership\nAs one of America's leading organizations that supports individuals with mobility disabilities, the United Spinal Association is excited to begin helping United deliver on many of its sustainability objectives.\nIn a statement, Vincenzo Piscopo, the CEO and President of the organization, said as follows:\n\"I am thrilled about this collaboration with United Airlines. I commend their commitment to making the travel experience more accessible for people with disabilities and their decision to choose United Spinal Association as a partner in this journey.\"\nPiscopo went on to add that this partnership demonstrates a major step being taken towards making accessible travel a reality. Furthermore, the executive noted that every additional collaboration of this kind will continue to help improve the travel experience for those with mobility disabilities.\n[Related ](/southwest-damages-basketball-team-wheelchairs/) [ Southwest Airlines Accused Of Damaging Wheelchair Basketball Team's Chairs Before Tournament ](/southwest-damages-basketball-team-wheelchairs/)\nThe carrier has since made sure disabled customers have a better experience in the future.",
