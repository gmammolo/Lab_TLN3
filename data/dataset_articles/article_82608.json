  "text": "TSA unveils new identity verification tech at ANC security checkpoints ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - New identity verification technology is being rolled out at Anchorage‘s Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) says facial matching technology will be used to verify a traveler’s identity during the process of security screening, prior to boarding a plane. The next time a traveler arrives at the airport for security screening, they can expect to see a Credential Authentication Technology (CAT) machine, which is equipped to take a real-time image of the traveler. The new machines are similar to the first generation CAT machines, but have cameras that compare the photo on a traveler’s identification with their real-time photo. “We know that we can enhance the job that TSA officers have been doing since the inception of the agency, but by using this technology, it gives them an extra tool to make sure that the traveler standing in front of them is the one that is featured on the photo ID, which is the one that has been vetted to ensure that they don’t pose a security risk,” explained TSA spokesperson Lorie Dankers. Dankers said that the photo is completely optional. Travelers are permitted to opt out in favor of an alternative identify verification process that is lengthier. “[A traveler’s] photo is only used for immediate identity verification,” she added. “It’s never used for any other purpose. It’s that real-time photo compared against the photo on — whatever you’re presenting as your photo ID.” She says that the technology is expected to improve safety while also speeding up the security process, as travelers won’t need to present a boarding pass along with identification. “Your biographical information, as well as your flight information, will appear on screen,” Dankers said. “And that’s all done with technology. “All the traveler has to do is hand over that photo ID. So it’s very simple, very streamlined, and so it does keep the line moving.” According to Dankers, the CAT machine cameras are accurate to roughly 99.7%. She said that the camera is able to take into account changes in a person, like weight gain or loss, facial hair or lack thereof. “The camera captures a wide shot of the traveler, and then it crops it down to its face, and that ensures that the traveler doesn’t have to position in just the right place in front of the camera,” she explained. “It’s really a very flexible technology.” The new CAT machines are coming to airports nationwide. Each TSA officer is receiving six hours of classroom training and two hours of on-the-job training to get familiar with the new technology. “We’re so happy that [the new technology has] come to Alaska,” Dankers said. “You’re going to see it soon in Juneau, as well as here at Anchorage, so keep an eye for it.” Copyright 2024 KTUU.
