  "text": "HBO has finally announced the release date and released the first full trailer for «Dune: The Prophecy» — prequel to Denis Villeneuve’s films.\nThe series is set 10,000 years before the events of «Dune» and tells the story of the formation of the mystical order of the Bene Gesserit, led by the Harkonnen sisters Vali (Emily Watson) and Tula (Olivia Williams). The cast also includes Mark Strong (Emperor Javikko), Chris Mason (swordmaster Keiran Atrid), Josh Huston (Constantine Corrino), Jodie May (Empress Natalia), Sarah-Sophie Boussnina (Princess Inez) and Travis Fimmel (the mysterious Desmond Hart).\nFrank Herbert has written a total of five sequel novels to «Dune» (the first of which is, «Messiah» already in the works by Denis Villeneuve), while his son Brian, together with Kevin J. Anderson, created a series of prequels after the writer’s death — including «The Order of the Sisters of Dune», which formed the basis of the series «Dune: The Prophecy».\nThe book was adapted for the television version by screenwriters Diane Ademu-John, Leah Benavidez, Jordan Goldberg and Carlito Rodriguez, while the directors were Anna Fester («Lou»), John Cameron («Severance») and Richard J. Lewis («Highly Dangerous»). The series has a long and difficult development history, including numerous showrunner changes and creative reboots: in November 2022, Diane Ademu-John stopped working as a co-creator of the series but remained as an executive producer, and in 2023, director Eugene Rank («Chernobyl») and one of the main roles, actress Shirley Henderson, left the project. Eventually, Alison Schapker became the showrunner.\nThe series «Dune: The» Prophecy will debut on HBO with the first episode on November 17 (probably also on Megogo MEGOGO is the exclusive partner of Warner Bros. Discovery's exclusive partner for HBO and Max in Ukraine with Ukrainian dubbing) — the rest of the six episodes will be released every Sunday.",
