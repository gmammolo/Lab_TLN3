  "text": "Titusville Police Safely Locate Missing Woman With Dementia\nBy\nSpace Coast Daily // June 21, 2024\nMissing Woman had tracking device/bracelet funded by BCSO Project Life Saver program\nBREVARD COUNTY, TITUSVILLE, FLORIDA – A Titusville woman reported missing has been found safe and uninjured on Friday, according to police.\n“Titusville Police Department (TPD) Officers responded to a call on Friday, at approximately 2:30 p.m. by a concerned spouse of a 76-year-old woman, who was receiving services from a business at Titus Landing, a premier shopping venue located at the intersection of South Washington Avenue and Harrison Street,” said Amy Matthews of the Titusville Police Department.\nAt the time he went to pick her up, she was nowhere to be found after her scheduled appointment was completed.\nOfficers responded immediately to the call for service and proceeded with a door-to-door business search within the shopping venue along with coordination of the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) STAR Helicopter.\nThe missing woman, a registered recipient of a tracking device/bracelet funded by the BCSO Project Life Saver program, which helps locate wandering patients who suffer from cognitive disabilities such as dementia, was signaling her presence within the Titus Landing vicinity via her tracking bracelet from the transmitter connecting to the STAR helicopter personnel.\nAfter receiving critical location information, Titusville Police were able to locate the woman near the movie theater within an hour of her reported disappearance.\n“Responding to a missing community member immediately becomes our highest response priority”, said acting TPD Patrol Lieutenant Mark Jennings.\n“This positive outcome can be attributed to the swift action from Titus Landing businesses, BSCO, and our TPD Officers, who invested multiple resources to successfully locate the missing woman”, added Jennings.\nFor more information on BCSO’s Project Life Saver Program,\nClick Here.",
