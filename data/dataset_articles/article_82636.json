By Anula Wiwatowska Oct 18, 2024 1 min read Share Article With the release of the Roomba Combo 10 Max robovac, iRobot now holds one of only three Matter compatible robot vacuum cleaners available in Australia. The latest model joins the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra , and Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo, in enabling the Matter 1.2 standard making it compatible with Matter Hubs, including Apple Home devices.\nMatter support allows robot vacuums to participate in automations, scenes, and use compatible voice assistants such as Siri to control basic functions of the device. While the protocol doesn’t support mapping, users can control primary functions without needing to utilise the manufacturer app. Despite the protocol being enabled, support isn’t currently available for any of the Matter enabled devices , but will be within Q4, 2024.\nApart from Matter support, the Combo 10 Max follows many of the same trends other flagship robot vacuums have this year. It comes equipped with a fully self-sufficient docking station including self-emptying, mop water refills and removal, self cleaning mop pads, and drying at the dock. The vacuum itself has dual rollers for less tangled hair, and a removable and washable microfibre mopping pad. It does however lack any specialty edge mopping which has become prevalent across devices such as the S8 MaxV Ultra, and Dreame X40 Ultra .\nThe device also has some clever features like Enhanced Dirt Detect which is able to recognise large concentrations of debris, and adapt cleaning based on what it finds. Coupled with its mapping technology, Dirt Detect automatically prioritises rooms it knows to need extra cleaning, and will even wash the mop before heading to that space to give it the best fighting chance.\nRoomba Combo 10 Max is currently available to pre-order , with orders shipping from October 24th. The recommended retail price is $2,199, and all pre-orders will come with a bonus Roomba 692 robot vacuum, and free shipping.\n\\\\ More from Reviews.org",
