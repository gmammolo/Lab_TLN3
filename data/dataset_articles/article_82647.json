  "text": "Today we are announcing that eligible U.S. users can now use Venmo to fund their accounts on MoonPay. Now, Venmo’s more than 60 million monthly active users can seamlessly fund transactions on the MoonPay platform using their Venmo balance or linked bank account, credit card, or debit card in Venmo. This integration gives consumers a new way to use their Venmo accounts and offers MoonPay users the safety and convenience users have come to know from Venmo. The Venmo integration comes on the heels of PayPal’s integration with MoonPay which gives users the ability to fund their accounts on MoonPay via PayPal. Venmo is rolling out now to be used by MoonPay users and its extensive partner network in the United States. This functionality will not be available for MoonPay users in New York or Texas.
