  "text": "Itanagar: The second joint scientific expedition to Khangri Glacier in Tawang district was flagged off by Arunachal chief secretary (CS) Manish Kumar Gupta on Thursday. Centre for Earth Sciences & Himalayan Studies director (CES&HS) Tana Tage said, the expedition team consists of scientists, research associates, and technical officers from the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), Goa, CES&HS Itanagar, and researchers from IIT-Roorkee.“The Arunachal Himalayas are ecologically sensitive and face significant challenges related to climate change, including glacial melting, changes in freshwater availability, and the risk of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods,” Tage said. He added that the understanding of these dynamics are crucial for ensuring the sustainability of local ecosystems, economies, and communities dwelling in high altitudes.Tage said the aim of the expedition is to conduct in-depth glaciological and cryosphere studies in the Arunachal Himalayas, hydrological changes and their impact on the region’s ecosystem. Also various scientific activities like measuring glacier flow discharge, riverbed profiling, steam ice drilling and installation of water level markers and stacks for long-term observation would be conducted. Tage further said the team will also identify a suitable location to establish a permanent base camp as part of the Polar and Cryosphere Studies (PACER), which will serve as a logistical hub for future glaciological studies in the region, with a focus on the Khangri Glacier and other glaciers in Arunachal. He added that they will also engage in mass balance studies, which are crucial for understanding the gain and loss of ice mass from the glacier system. We also published the following articles recentlyKyrgyzstan opens rare probe into glacier destructionKyrgyzstan has initiated a criminal investigation into a private company's illegal destruction of glacial ice in the southern Osh region for a road to a coal mine. Glaciers in the country, crucial for freshwater, are at risk due to climate change and mining. This action underscores growing concerns over water shortages in Central Asia.114174395Researchers study Vijayanagara inscription in BarkurUnique research on two Vijayanagara-Tuluva inscriptions at Bhandarakeri Mutt in Barkur reveals historical details about Jain tradition and land donations dating back to the reigns of Krishnadevaraya and Achyutaraya. The study offers new insights into regional governance and religious practices, providing valuable timelines and context for Tulunadu's history.114176860Apple researchers conduct study on AIs reasoning ability in mathematics: What they foundApple researchers found that large language models (LLMs) show significant variability in mathematical reasoning when presented with different versions of the same question. They discovered that LLMs rely on pattern-matching rather than true logical reasoning, leading to inconsistent performance, especially in complex tasks. This calls into question the reliability of current metrics used to evaluate LLMs.114173142",
