  "text": "Google Just Made It Even Easier to Find the Cheapest Flights A new dedicated feature on the search platform will show the cheapest flights available for your next trip. [| Marco Bottigelli/Moment/Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/crowd-of-people-in-galleria-vittorio-emanuele-ii-at-royalty-free-image/1669837323?phrase=travel+destination&searchscope=image%2Cfilm&adppopup=true) [| Marco Bottigelli/Moment/Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/crowd-of-people-in-galleria-vittorio-emanuele-ii-at-royalty-free-image/1669837323?phrase=travel+destination&searchscope=image%2Cfilm&adppopup=true) I think it is great that Google Flights has a ton of features. They are all so cool. But if I am honest with myself and everyone else, my sole focus when using the platform is finding the absolute [cheapest flight possible](https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/best-tips-for-finding-cheap-flights). If there were a \"standing room only\" option, I'd complain endlessly about it, but I'd also take full advantage of it if it meant saving a couple hundred bucks on a roundtrip ticket. That said, I am very interested in Google's newest feature, which will make finding the cheapest flights easier. The new Google Flights feature is a \"Cheapest\" tab that will put all the cheapest flights in one spot. \"When you search with Google Flights, the best options appear at the top of the results, based on a mix of price and convenience,\" a Google [statement ](https://blog.google/products/search/google-flights-cheapest-tab/)about the new feature reads. \"But sometimes, there might be cheaper options available for those of you who are willing to give up some convenience for the best deal.\" Now, there will be a tab for the best flights based on departing times, number of layovers, and other factors, as well as a tab for the cheapest flights. That second tab will only consider the price. In the image above, you can see the example on the mobile version. If you are a [Millennial](https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/booking-flights-mobile-desktop-internet-debate) and prefer booking on your laptop or desktop, the feature will also be available there. The \"Cheapest\" tab will feature what Google calls \"more…creative itineraries, like longer layovers, self-transfers or purchasing different legs of the trip through multiple airlines or booking sites.\" If you are willing to spend 30 hours getting from San Francisco to Paris, that is the tab for you. If you don't book through multiple airlines or [longer layovers](https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/time-needed-to-leave-airport-during-layover)—or maybe even prefer them—you can find significant travel savings by using the option. The feature will be rolling out globally over the next few weeks, so if you're looking for cheap flights before then, you can use some of the other money-saving [Google Flights ](https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/google-flights-travel-hack-cheapest-airfare-tiktok)[hacks](https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/google-flights-travel-hack-cheapest-airfare-tiktok) that are available now.
