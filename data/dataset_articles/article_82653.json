However, the real savings kick in with larger bundles.\nPurchasing three or more products simultaneously unlocks a 15% discount. Such as, combining a Samsung Galaxy S25, a Galaxy Tab S10+, and a Galaxy Watch7 yields a savings of 7,840 CZK, effectively making the watch “free.”\nMaximizing Savings: Combining Discounts and Bonuses The 15% discount isn’t the only avenue for savings.
