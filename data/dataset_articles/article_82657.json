  "text": "Summary\n- TikTok updated desktop features to include a floating mini-player and horizontal live streaming.\n- The desktop interface has a modular layout to reduce distractions and a new Collections feature.\n- Elsewhere, Instagram is preparing to launch a standalone Reels app to compete more directly with TikTok.\nYouTube's been chasing TikTok's audience for years. TikTok hardly invented short-form social video (remember Vine?), but it certainly popularized it in a way no platform had before. Shorts videos were YouTube's attempt to capture some of that TikTok magic — if you spend any time watching Shorts, you'll surely see plenty of content pulled directly from TikTok and reposted on YouTube.\nNow, TikTok's making a grab for some of YouTube's bread and butter with updated desktop features. TikTok already had a desktop interface, but with its latest round of updates, the short-form platform is picking up a few features that should look familiar to YouTube users.\nAs TikTok has shared on its blog, the desktop interface accessible at TikTok.com has been revamped with a handful of features you might find useful if you're accessing the short-form video service from your desk. There's a new floating mini-player sort of like the one YouTube offers when you navigate away from a video. Unlike on YouTube, though, TikTok's floating player can be freely moved around your desktop and over other windows, making it closer to Google Meet's floating video window implementation. The mini-player is only available on desktop inside the Chrome browser.\nTikTok's also picking up horizontal live streaming. You'll be able to watch these landscape-orientation videos full-screen on desktop, and also on mobile by rotating your device. TikTok also mentions an improved \"modular layout\" to reduce distractions and facilitate \"seamless feed exploration,\" and a new Collections fetaure that lets you save videos into multiple custom categories.\nNew features available right now\nAll of the features above are available at TikTok.com right now. The platform's not becoming a desktop-first experience, by any means, but these recent changes should make its desktop interface a little more user-friendly.\nIn other TikTok news, Instagram may be making a more direct play for TikTok's audience by splitting off its Reels into a separate app. According to The Information, Instagram is internally preparing to launch a standalone Reels app that'll be more directly competitive with TikTok.",
