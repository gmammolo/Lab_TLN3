  "text": "Mr. Olivier Roussy Newton reports\nBTQ TECHNOLOGIES AWARDED MITACS ELEVATE GRANT TO ADVANCE CUTTING-EDGE QUANTUM SIMULATION RESEARCH\nBTQ Technologies Corp. is participating as an industry partner in the Mitacs Elevate postdoctoral fellowship program funding advanced research on reducing resource requirements for quantum simulation. This collaboration reflects BTQ's commitment to fostering academic partnerships and accelerating quantum computing advancements.\nThe research project, titled \"Exploiting the Structure of Quantum Hamiltonians to Reduce the Resource Requirements for Quantum Simulation,\" has been awarded a $158,000 Mitacs Elevate grant. Led by Dr. Aleksei Uvarov, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto's Department of Physical and Environmental Sciences, and supervised by Prof. Artur Izmaylov, the project will focus on optimizing quantum algorithms for more efficient simulation of complex quantum systems.\nAs an industry partner, BTQ is supporting the research to develop novel computational techniques, including linear combination of unitaries block encoding, tensor decomposition optimizations and spectral range reduction. These innovations have the potential to enhance the scalability of quantum simulations, making them more viable for real-world applications in quantum chemistry, materials science and secure communications.\n\"At BTQ Technologies, we recognize that industry-academic collaboration is key to unlocking the full potential of quantum computing,\" said Olivier Roussy Newton, chief executive officer at BTQ Technologies. \"By conducting this research, we are investing in breakthrough technologies that could lead to more efficient quantum simulation methods, ultimately advancing the development of quantum-secure solutions.\"\nMitacs, a national non-profit organization, connects top researchers with industry partners to drive innovation in Canada. Through this partnership, BTQ is helping bridge the gap between theoretical quantum research and practical, real-world applications, reinforcing its leadership in the quantum security sector.\nAbout BTQ Technologies Corp.\nBTQ was founded by a group of postquantum security experts with an interest in addressing the urgent security threat posed by large-scale quantum computers. With the support of leading research institutes and universities, BTQ has an extensive technology portfolio and commercialization platform focused on accelerating quantum advantage.\nWe seek Safe Harbor.\n© 2025 Canjex Publishing Ltd.
