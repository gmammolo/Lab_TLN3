  "text": "Despite the ongoing cryptocurrency selloff, Standard Chartered is standing by its bold prediction that Bitcoin (BTC) will hit $500,000 during Donald Trump's current presidency.\nBitcoin's price has continued to slide, now down 1.85% in the past 24 hours to $84,408.8 as of 12:43 PM ET. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap has dropped more than 20% from its all-time high of just over $109,000, reached on Jan. 20—Trump's inauguration day.\nDespite the downturn, Standard Chartered analysts see Bitcoin hitting $200,000 by the end of 2025, followed by a gradual climb toward $500,000. While some investors fear a potential new “crypto winter”, the bank remains bullish, calling the recent drop a temporary setback.\nStandard Chartered's crypto team points to rising institutional adoption and “regulatory clarity” from the Trump administration as key factors that could reduce volatility and fuel Bitcoin's long-term rally.",
