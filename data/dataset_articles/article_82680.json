  "text": "Deepal Australia has announced a series of updates for its all-electric S07 SUV, addressing customer feedback as the brand looks to strengthen its position in the Australian market.\nThe company says Changan Automobile, which owns the Deepal brand, has worked quickly to refine several aspects of the vehicle including extending service intervals and improving driver assistance features.\nOne of the most significant changes is a revision to the service schedule. Deepal has extended the S07's service interval from 10,000km to 20,000km while retaining the 12-month time-based interval.\nThe brand has also scrapped the previously planned 5000km initial service, saying its engineering analysis shows these changes won't impact reliability.\nHundreds of new car deals are available through CarExpert right now. Get the experts on your side and score a great deal. Browse now.\nDeepal is also tweaking its Driver Monitoring System (DMS) to better suit Australian expectations. Updates to the alert system will be pushed to vehicles after final local testing.\nMeanwhile, changes to the adaptive cruise control (ACC) and Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control (IACC) functions will focus on refining how the system slows down for bends.\nDeepal says the speed reduction function will be decoupled between ACC and IACC, aiming for smoother and more consistent adjustments.\nCormac Cafolla, general manager of Deepal Australia, says these latest refinements demonstrate the brand's commitment to evolving its product for local drivers.\n\"In just two months, our OEM partner has shown a strong commitment to Australian drivers by responding quickly and thoughtfully to customer feedback. With Changan Automobile's scale and expertise, we have the ability to move fast and address the needs of Australian consumers,\" he said.\nAccording to the brand's distributor, Inchcape Australia, the brand will continue to \"listen, learn, and grow\" as it adapts Deepal vehicles to meet Australian buyers' expectations.\nThe updates are expected to be rolled out to existing vehicles via software updates, though the exact timing has not yet been confirmed.\nDeepal launched locally in late 2024, offering the S07 as a fully electric mid-sized SUV.\nThe brand is owned by Changan Automobile, one of China's largest carmakers, and is positioning itself as a high-tech alternative in the growing EV space.\nMORE: Everything Deepal S07\nContent originally sourced from: CarExpert.com.au",
