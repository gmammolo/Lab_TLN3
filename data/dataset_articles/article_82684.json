  "text": "Chinese brand Deepal has locked in the electric S05 SUV for Australia, due here during the second half of 2025.\nThis move follows the launch of the larger S07 SUV and Deepal's commitment to expanding its electric vehicle (EV) lineup in Australia under the Inchcape distributorship.\nThe Deepal S05 is set to compete directly with established models such as the BYD Atto 3, offering Australian consumers a new option in the fast-growing small electric SUV segment.\nMeasuring 4620mm in length, 1900mm in width, and 1600mm in height, with a wheelbase of 2880mm, the S05 maintains the Deepal family look with a modern exterior design that includes features like frameless windows and hidden door handles.\nCompared to the BYD Atto 3, the S05 has a 160mm longer wheelbase.\nHundreds of new car deals are available through CarExpert right now. Get the experts on your side and score a great deal. Browse now.\nAlthough exact details are yet to be officially confirmed for the Australian market, the Deepal S05 offers two powertrain options in other markets.\nThe pure electric variant has a 175kW/320Nm rear-mounted electric motor, delivering 320Nm of torque, powered by a 56.12kWh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery.\nIt boasts an estimated range of up to 510 kilometres on the CLTC cycle.\nThe S05 also comes in a range-extended electric vehicle (EREV) version, which combines a 1.5-litre petrol engine acting as a generator with a 160kW electric motor.\nThis gives it a pure electric range of approximately 200 kilometres and a total range exceeding 1200 kilometres when utilising both power sources.\nInside the cabin, the S05 boasts a 15.4-inch central touchscreen powered by the Qualcomm SA8155P chip, running Deepal OS 3.0.\nLike a Tesla, there's no traditional instrument cluster but, unlike a Tesla, a useful head-up display (HUD) provides drivers with essential information directly on the windshield.\nDepending on the variant, the interior design includes a two-tone colour scheme with chrome accents, hidden air vents, and a panoramic sunroof.\nThe confirmation of another Deepal model will add to the growing list of new Chinese vehicles appearing in 2025, with brands such as MG, Chery, GWM, and BYD, as well as newcomers like Zeekr, Leapmotor, and Aion, all set to expand their lineups.\nAdditional information regarding the S05's specifications, pricing, and availability will be available toward the end of March.\nContent originally sourced from: CarExpert.com.au",
