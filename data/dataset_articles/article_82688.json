  "text": "Research\nZynamite Supplementation Linked to Improved Information Processing, Cognitive Performance: Study\nThe water-soluble mango leaf extract was linked to significant improvements in cognitive tests after a single dose compared to placebo.\nA new clinical study found that supplementing with Zynamite, a mango leaf extract produced by Nektium Pharma and distributed by PLT Health Solutions, was associated with improvements over placebo on cognitive tests, the companies reported.\nThe domains in which participants saw significant improvements included processing speed, complex task handling, and mental flexibility, and the supplement was also linked to better mood compared to placebo.\nZynamite and Zynamite S, the standard and water-soluble versions of the ingredient, are each standardized to a 60% concentration of the bioactive compound mangiferin, and previous studies have linked the ingredient to improvements in energy and cognitive performance.\n“Our customers asked us for a water-soluble form of the award-winning ingredient and our partner Nektium Pharma delivered. This ingredient dramatically changes the range of finished products that can include Zynamite. As a solutions provider, we see value in developing new clinical data on each product grade so our customers could bring innovation to consumers with confidence. Zynamite offers rapid, sustained cognitive support relevant to target groups like students and working professionals. The enhanced cognitive function may help people tackle complex tasks and solve problems. Improved alertness, attention, and focus for up to 5 hours, can help people stay on track during classes, studying, or at work. Zynamite has also been shown to help manage tension and emotional discomfort, providing a sense of calm, even during demanding situations. The rapid, sustained effects can contribute to extended focus and productivity sessions.”\nStudy Details\nAccording to PLT and Nektium, the study involved 120 healthy university students who were given a single dose of 100 mg of Zynamite S, 150 mg of Zynamite S, or a matching placebo, and were then assessed three times over a five hour period. The study was conducted in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design with a seven-day washout period between tests.\nAccording to the study, subjects that took either dose of Zynamite S saw significant improvements in processing speed, focus, attention, cognitive flexibility, and the ability to manage tasks. Outside of performance benefits, subjects taking the supplement also reportedly had improved mood, reduced tension, and enhanced energy. These effects were pronounced up to five hours after ingestion.\nIt was important to study the potential cognitive effects of Zynamite S at a low dose over a short time frame, said Laura Lopez, PhD, head of product research, development, and innovation at Nektium. “The results of this study certainly demonstrate that using Zynamite S is ‘experiential.’ Cognitive performance and mood improvements were shown over the course of a single morning in subjects undergoing a demanding battery of tests.”\n“These results will resonate with consumers who want to experience their benefits quickly,” said Jeremy Appleton, ND, director of medical and scientific affairs at PLT. “We are excited to have research on this new galenic form that delivers rapid, experiential benefits across many important domains of cognitive performance and mental well-being.”\nZynamite S can add value to energy, sports, hydration, and other types of functional benefits, said Steve Fink, PLT’s vice president of marketing. “Zynamite S is designed for use in applications such as RTDs and shots where solubility, neutral taste, heat stability, and transparency in solution are key. Botanical ingredients are often difficult to formulate, because of taste and solubility issues that can make them challenging for use in beverage formulations. Nektium is at the forefront in optimizing botanicals using smart delivery technology. This technology breakthrough for optimized performance in beverages will have a meaningful impact on the industry.”",
