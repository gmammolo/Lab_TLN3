  "text": "Two Aussie startups revealed new funding rounds this week and they have two things in common: they were both founded in Queensland, and they are both powered by AI.\nKeep reading to learn more about Springboards and Tendl.\nSpringboards: $5 million L-R: Springboards co-founders Pip Bingemann and Amy Tucker, with CTO Kieran Browne. Source: supplied Noosa-founded startup Springboards leads this week’s startup funding round-up with $5 million in seed funding from leading VC fund Blackbird Ventures.\nFounded by advertising industry veterans Amy Tucker and Pip Bingemann, Springboards bills itself as an “AI-powered platform built to accelerate creativity in advertising”.\nThe Springboards platform offers agencies nine AI-powered tools that have been designed to bolster creativity at every point in the advertising process. This includes helping teams uncover insights, generate ideas, validate concepts and design campaigns.\nAccording to the company — which has participated in a Google for Startups Accelerator program for Australian AI startups and has been named a pitch finalist for SXSW in Austin, Texas next month — its tech can generate between 10 to 30 times more creative diversity than leading AI platforms OpenAI , Anthropic and Gemini combined.\nThe startup officially launched this week but its platform is already being used by more than 120 advertising agencies globally. According to reports , the company has a pre-money valuation of more than $20 million.\n“Creativity in advertising is under siege,” said Tucker in a statement provided to SmartCompany .\n“Shrinking margins, skyrocketing pitching costs, and ever-higher client expectations are threatening the craft. We built Springboards to help creatives do what they do best: think big, explore boldly, and stay original.”\nTendl: $2 million L-R: Tidal Ventures principal investor Fee Barry and Tendl CEO and founder Laurie Nicol. Source: supplied Queensland AI-powered tendering platform Tendl also revealed it has secured new funding this week, after completing a $2 million pre-seed funding round led by local VC firm Tidal Ventures.\nStartmate, 77 Partners, Brisbane Angels and Aussie Angels also participated in the round for the startup, which was founded in 2024 by CEO Laurie Nicol.\nTendl, which is based in Toowoomba, is an AI-based platform that is designed to make it easier, and faster, for businesses to write, submit and complete government tenders through automated workflows.\nNicol told SmartCompany earlier this week that he plans to use the new funding to expand Tendl’s development team, while also expanding Tendl’s operations both in Australia and overseas.\n“Up until now, I’ve been solo. Before this investment, I did everything in the business. I wrote the software, I spoke to customers and I did all the marketing,” he said.\n“So it’s that opportunity to really grow the team and hire some more domain-specific experts, people who can help to run the engineering team, build the tool, and allow me to go and pursue the sales side of things.\nRead more .\nNever miss a story: sign up to SmartCompany’s free daily newsletter and find our best stories on LinkedIn.",
