  "text": "The career for the development of artificial intelligence does not stop accelerating. In November 2022 we witnessed the launch of GPT-3.5, the model that laid the Chatgpt bases and marked a turning point in the conversational. Almost two years later, we are faced with the arrival of GPT-4.5, a new evolution that aims to continue expanding the limits of this promising technology.\nWe are facing a transition model between GPT-4O and GPT-5, but with a key role in OpenAi’s strategy. The company has decided that GPT-4.5 will be the last one without incorporating “chain of thought”, giving way to a new generation with incorporated reasoning capabilities. This change seeks to improve the clarity of his family of products, which has become complex over time.\nA more advanced model, with greater emotional intelligence AI is reaching a point where we no longer settle for having models capable of solving complex problems. They improve programming, science, engineering and mathematics is very good, but we look for models that can interact more spontaneously with humans. This makes us understand OpenAi with GPT-4.5.\nHis new language model is presented as the greatest and most advanced published by the startup to date. The researchers affirm that it is not only more natural, but their knowledge base has expanded to face complex challenges in various scientific disciplines, while improving their ability to solve logical problems.\nGPT-4.5 wants to stand out for its emotional intelligence, and in a recent test it has proven to live up to it. A member of the OpenAI team tested his abilities by sending him a message full of emotion. With a natural tone and without hiding his anger, he explained that a friend had canceled him at the last minute and asked for help to write a message that reflected his discomfort.\nChatgpt with GPT-4.5 detects that the user is frustrated and, instead of enlivening the anger, he suggests a calmer and diplomatic message to express his discomfort without damaging friendship: “Hello, the truth is that it has annoyed me a lot that the plans have been canceled again, I really wanted to see you. Can we talk about what is happening?”\nTo achieve this change, Openai has modified its focus on creating models. Not radically, but incorporating new supervision techniques together with traditional methods such as supervised fine adjustment (SFT) and learning by reinforcement based on human feedback (RLHF), which were already fundamental in the development of GPT-4.\nIn development.\nImages | OpenAI\nIn Xataka | Alexa+, first impressions: the explosion of AI feels great to the Amazon assistant. But there are also many unknowns",
