  "text": "Outdoor TV antenna making strong comeback – US Households Cut the Cord: OTA Antennas and Streaming Redefine TV Entertainment By: AB Newswire February 27, 2025 at 17:04 PM EST The Resurgence of OTA Antennas in U.S. Households\nThe household entertainment landscape is shifting for US families. After three decades of cable and satellite subscriptions dominating the market, households are transitioning back to Over-the-Air (OTA) antenna ( https://www.usawireless.tv/antennateam ) programming in combination with streaming services for cost-effective and customized experience.\nOffering local sports, news and major network broadcasts, OTA was once the primary way households received television entertainment with OTA antennas installed in over 90% of households during the 70s and 80s. With the rise of cable and satellite TV, many households have transitioned over for more programming and higher quality. However this trend is changing as households are cutting their cords for OTA and streaming. With the Federal Communications Commission mandating broadcasting transition from analog to digital, improvements in OTA technology and high costs of cable subscriptions, many households are switching back to OTA antennas to save money while still enjoying their favorite shows. According to the 2023 Horowitz Research’s 'State of Media' study ( https://www.horowitzresearch.com/syndicated-research/state-of-media-disruption-and-change/) , households with digital television antennas have increased from 14% to 18% and are expected to increase further. In addition, the research has noted that 58% of antenna owners also want news and information specific to their community.\nThe Cost-Saving Advantage of OTA TV\nOne of the most compelling reasons for the resurgence of OTA antennas is cost savings. As costs of living are on the rise in the US, many families are re-evaluating whether they need all the channels offered by cable. While OTA antennas only provide local programming, households wanting any specific programming can pick and choose streaming from popular services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+.\nCompared to a cable subscription which locks them in with more channels and programming than they can realistically consume, households are able to cut their monthly costs significantly and recoup the costs of installations within a few months to a year through savings.\nThe Role of Linear Programming\nAs on-demand streaming makes up the bulk of TV consumption, millions of households still tune in to linear programming including news, sports and major events. In Nielsen’s 2023 study, a little under 50% of US household TV consumption is linear TV ( https://www.warc.com/content/feed/us-linear-tv-falls- beneath-50-of-tv-time/en-GB/8535).\nThe full picture on linear TV is limited as data collected is much more sophisticated compared to digital and streaming. This makes OTA stats potentially underrepresented in industry studies making the true appeal potentially much higher in the shifting household media consumption landscape.\nInstallation and Usage\nThe process for setting up an OTA antenna is relatively simple and fast. For urban inner-city households, an indoor antenna can be mounted indoors on walls or windows and might suffice, giving them a connection to a broadcast tower within 1-5 miles. However, those living in areas a bit further from transmission sources and for those desiring a much higher quality of video reception should turn their focus toward a high-quality outdoor antenna with installation done by professionals. The Antenna Team at USA Wireless ( https://www.usawireless.tv/antennateam) , with over 30 years experience installing\nresidential TV systems, can help households add free OTA channels to their program viewing options. For a one-time cost to have the pros at AntennaTeam.com come to your home and install a brand-new high-quality outdoor antenna, you add thousands of free shows, sports, news, movies and more round the clock, day and night every day of the year for years to come.\nConclusion\nOTA antennas are making a comeback in US households and it is fueled by a growing desire for cost- effective, high-quality entertainment options. As cable costs continue to rise, households are starting to re-evaluate whether they need all the channels offered by cable and are turning to OTA for local pr ogramming supplemented with on-demand streaming at a fraction of the cable subscription costs.
