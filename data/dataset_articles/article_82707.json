  "text": "ZHIYUN Launches AI Tracking Technology for Smartphone Gimbals\nWith the insatiable demand for timely video content, video creators now need to produce compelling, pro-quality video, on demand, with lightweight equipment, and a small crew – often only one person. This challenge seemed impossible, but ZHIYUN has developed AI that controls smartphone gimbals to help any creator produce professional video that’s ready to broadcast – or even to livestream. The technology produces astounding results for Vlogs, outdoor sports, and live streaming, as well as general video shooting. The rapid growth of the short video, live streaming, and Vlog markets has led to an increasing demand for more efficient and intelligent video creation tools. So, responding to this market demand, ZHIYUN is introducing innovative AI tracking technology to enhance the creation experience and efficiency for content creators.\nAn AI solution that makes professional videos\nAt the core of ZHIYUN’s AI video tech is smart tracking and gesture recognition. This capability allows a smart ZHIYUN gimbal to keep the subject in view, and respond instantly to user demands. The technology is now so sophisticated that the star of the video can also be the director. Whether vlogging solo or capturing action shots, the AI tracker becomes the user’s personal camera operator, ensuring perfect video quality, even when the user is far from the camera.\nThe AI tracking unit installs easily onto popular ZHIYUN gimbals, such as the SMOOTH 5S AI and CINEPEER CQ5 smartphone stabilizers. It only takes a second for users to place the compact AI tracker onto the magnetizing slot on the gimbal phone clamp.\nIntuitive gesture control makes users into directors\nThe AI tracker contains its own independent camera that is dedicated to recognizing gestures, and controlling the gimbal to keep the subject in the shot. The system does not only follow the subject of the video, but frames and focuses the subject perfectly and responsively. This technology allows for automatic target following, without the need to connect to an external app.\nZHIYUN’s AI produces impressive results with barely any effort from the user. But, when users want more control to get a stunning shot, the system also enables user control of the gimbal and camera through simple hand gestures.\nFor example, a simple ‘OK’ signal (circled thumb and forefinger) tells the gimbal and camera to track the user. A raised palm tells it to stop tracking. There are also simple gestures for common requirements, such as following a subject without keeping it in the centre of the frame, or to count down a few seconds before starting filming. These gestures are recognized with either hand.\nFront and back camera AI tracking\nSimply rotate the tracker 180° to switch the camera direction to provide either front camera orrear camera following. The independent tracker will continue to follow and frame the subject, and to respond to hand gestures.\nNo matter what happens, the AI technology will stay glued to the subject, with sophisticated features like re-identification and recovery tracking after re-framing the shot. The result is perfect video without hassle.\nFind out more\nTo purchase AI tracker, please visit: geni.us/pr-AITRACKER\nTo purchase SMOOTH 5S AI, please visit: geni.us/pr-SM5SAI\nTo purchase CINEPEER CQ5, please visit: geni.us/pr-CQ5\nTo purchase from ZHIYUN store, please visit: geni.us/ZHIYUN-Store-PR\nTo purchase from Amazon, please visit: geni.us/AMZ-Store-PR-Sales",
