  "text": "Sony announces FE 400-800mm and FE 16mm F1.8 G lens\nSony announces the FE 16mm F1.8 G (SEL16F18G), a premium G Lens™ that combines the expressive power of a high-resolution ultra-wide angle with high portability thanks to its compact, lightweight design, allowing creators to express their creativity in an extensive range of still and video shooting scenes. When paired with the latest Sony Alpha™ series cameras this lens is great for scenery, architecture, starry skies and more, whilst also offering outstanding close-up capabilities alongside precise and quiet AF (autofocus).\nOutstanding resolution at ultra-wide 16 mm angles of view\nThe FE 16mm F1.8 G is an ideal lens for creating dynamic and spectacular wide-angle perspectives. The optical design includes two AA (Advanced Aspherical) elements for stunning image resolution at all apertures. One Super ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass element and three ED elements suppress chromatic aberration right out to the image periphery, whilst an optimised coating minimises flare and ghosting.\nSupreme G Lens bokeh and outstanding close-up performance\nThis new G Lens delivers stunning bokeh with its large F1.8 maximum aperture, 11-blade circular aperture. Close-up performance is excellent with a minimum focus distance of 0.15 m/0.5 ft and maximum magnification of 0.25x when using AF (0.13 m/0.43 ft, 0.30x for MF). All of this makes it possible to capture unique wide-angle perspectives with deep, exquisite bokeh.\nLarge-aperture ultra-wide performance in a compact lens\nThe use of aspherical lens elements in the FE 16mm F1.8 G, including Sony’s high-precision AA (Advanced Aspherical) lens, has made it possible to create a full-frame ultra-wide lens that is a compact 73.8 x 75 mm (3 x 3 inch) and weighs just 304 g (10.8 oz). It is small, lightweight, and mobile whilst delivering spectacular imaging performance for a wide range of subjects including landscapes, architecture, starry skies, and more.\nFast, precise autofocus supports high-level imaging\nTwo XD (extreme dynamic) linear motors ensure fast, precise AF and tracking. A control algorithm developed specifically for the XD linear motors achieves enhanced response that largely negates delay and vibration that are likely to occur when driving a large-diameter focus lens group, for exceptionally quiet, low-vibration operation. All of this makes it possible for the FE 16mm F1.8 G to capture important moments when shooting active, fast-moving subjects.\nRefined, stable performance for video\nThe FE 16mm F1.8 G’s advanced lens technology reduces focus breathing for smooth video footage. The breathing compensation function[i] provided in compatible Alpha bodies is also supported, and in-body Active Mode[ii] image stabilisation can make it easy to capture stable wide-angle video whilst walking. What’s more, the new lens accepts standard 67 mm front filter and is easy to balance on a gimbal.\nComprehensive control and solid reliability\nA focus ring, focus hold button, focus mode switch, aperture ring, and iris lock switch are provided and alternative functions can be assigned to the focus hold button. The aperture ring provides hands-on control, while a click ON/OFF switch adds versatility, and a Focus mode switch allows instant autofocus/manual switching. Lastly, a dust and moisture resistant design[iii] and fluorine front-element coating maximises reliability and durability.\nPricing and Availability\nThe FE 16mm F1.8 G will be available in April 2025 for approximately €1,000 EUR at a variety of Sony’s authorised dealers.\nSony announces the FE 400-800mm F6.3-8 G OSS (SEL400800G) - Sony’s first[i] 800 mm super-telephoto zoom G Lens. This brand-new Alpha lens flaunts high resolution performance across the entire zoom range, beautiful bokeh, as well as fast, precise, and accurate AF (autofocus). In addition, the inner-zoom design, which minimises change in the center of gravity, allows for stable framing. It is also compatible with the separately sold 1.4x and 2x teleconverter[ii] that can extend the maximum focal length to 1600 mm making this lens ideal for shooting birds, wildlife, sports, aircraft and landscapes.\n“At Sony, the needs of photographers and creators are always prioritised so we are very proud to introduce the FE 400-800MM F6.3-8 G OSS - the longest focal length in the Sony E-mount lens line-up,” said Yann Salmon Legagneur, Head of IP&S Marketing, Sony Europe. “With premium G Lens quality and an innovative design, this super-telephoto zoom lens delivers outstanding image quality at all focal lengths, even up to 1600 mm with a 2x teleconverter.”\nGo long with the Alpha lens of 800 mm super telephoto zoom\nThe FE 400-800mm F6.3-8 G OSS is the Alpha lens to cover a 400 mm to800 mm super telephoto range and can even be extended to a maximum focal length of 1600 mm with a 2x teleconverter. With an inner-zoom mechanism, the length of the lens does not change, so the center of gravity remains almost unchanged for stable handling and control. The lens features a smooth, easy zoom ring rotation for precise zooming, whilst careful design prevents any accidental focal length changes.\nBeautiful rendering and natural bokeh throughout the zoom range\nThe FE 400-800mm F6.3-8 G OSS has an 11-blade circular aperture that helps to create beautiful ball bokeh in smooth, creamy background when shooting with a narrow depth of field. Six ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass elements effectively control chromatic aberration, whilst flare and ghosting in backlit conditions are also thoroughly suppressed for beautiful photography.\nFast, precise AF captures even the quickest subjects\nTwo precision linear motors drive the FE 400-800mm F6.3-8 G OSS’s focus group for fast, accurate focusing. Tracking keeps up with the 120 fps[iii] maximum burst speed of the Alpha 9 III, and quiet operation expands the array of possibilities. A focus range switch (FULL/10m-NEAR/¥-8m) can also be used to optimise control for different subject distances. Focus breathing is suppressed for refined movie quality.\nSolid support for handheld or tripod-mounted shooting\nThe FE 400-800mm F6.3-8 G OSS can easily be used handheld without shake-induced blur by the built-in Optical SteadyShot TM image stabilisation. What’s more, stabilisation is even better with an Alpha body that includes image stabilisation. Durable components, optimised balance, and a non-removable foot maximises reliability and performance. And when using a tripod, the tripod mount foot can be quickly rotated for horizontal or vertical orientation, that supports a wide range of shooting subjects.\nHigh-level control and reliability for any situation\nThree focus hold buttons at 90° increments around the FE 400-800mm F6.3-8 G OSS ’s barrel allow easy access in any orientation and other functions can be assigned to the buttons as needed. The internal zoom and a dust and moisture resistant[iv] design maximises reliability with a front element that has a fluorine coating that repels contaminants and makes the lens easier to clean. Additionally, Full-time DMF automatically engages manual focus when the focus ring is operated, making it easy to apply fine manual adjustments or change the focus entirely. Lastly, the lens hood has a new design with a lock button and filter opening for easy operation.\nPricing and Availability\nThe FE 400-800mm F6.3-8 G OSS will be available in March 2025 for approximately €3,000 EUR at a variety of Sony’s authorised dealers.",
