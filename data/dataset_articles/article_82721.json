  "text": "February 27, 2025\nHow to start a club basketball league with AI\nBall smarter by starting a club basketball league with AI. Get guidance on designing logos, scheduling, and more.\nLearn more\nIf you find interviews tricky or want to get better at answering job interview practice questions, learn how to make AI your job interview coach.\nAI is a powerful resource when it comes to preparing for job interviews. One benefit is that generative AI tailors interview support to a specific job. When you share a job description, AI knows the kinds of questions your interviewer may ask and what questions you should ask the interviewer.

While practicing for an interview with a friend or loved one is often useful, some people find it more intimidating. When you practice for a job interview with AI, it’s easier to relax and answer questions without worrying about what the other person thinks of you. Finally, AI is a 24/7 resource. AI will serve as your interview helper in a pinch, answering any of your questions in seconds or simulating an interview with you on the spot.\nElevate your writing and collaborate with others - anywhere, anytime\nSimulating an interview with AI beforehand may help you feel less nervous and more prepared. Prompt AI to ask you job interview questions and tell it you’ll answer each one. Then, ask AI to rate your response or provide feedback. Here are example prompts to make AI your job interview simulator:\nAsk AI for job interview practice questions if you don’t want to spend time on a full interview simulation. This is also a great way to gather questions if a friend needs assistance with their upcoming interview and wants you to act as a mock interviewer. Prepare for your interview with these prompts:\nAt the end of your interview, the interviewer will likely ask if you have any questions for them. Use this time to get to know the role or company and express your interest in it. Try these example prompts, and feel free to modify them:\nNow that you know how to prepare for an interview with AI, you’ll feel more confident before going into one. Find out more ways to progress your career with AI—see how to write resumes and cover letters or write better emails.\nIt’s the Office you know, plus the tools to help you work better together, so you can get more done—anytime, anywhere.",
