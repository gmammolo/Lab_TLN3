It’s like how I felt about to deliver a baby,” King said. “I thought I wanted to open myself up to new adventures and step out of my comfort zone.”\nPrior to making her decision, King said she consulted with her children and Oprah Winfrey before accepting a seat on the rocket.\n“Once Kirby and Will and Oprah was fine with it, I was fine,” King said. “I thought Oprah would say no, no. She said, ‘I think if you don’t do it, when they all come back and you had the opportunity to do it, you will be kicking yourself.’ She’s right.”\ntoBlue Origin, the mission marks the 31st flight in its history, with 52 people having already blasted off with the program,\nincludingStar Trek actor William Shatner.\nThe company notes this is the first all-female flight crew since 1963, when Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova took a solo spaceflight.\nThe NS-31 mission is set to launch this spring.",
