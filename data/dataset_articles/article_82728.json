  "text": "Yakuza games typically feature a large cast of characters, and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is no exception. There are dozens of characters Goro Majima can recruit to join the Goro Pirates, including both new and returning faces. In addition, there are rival pirate crews, Honolulu shopkeepers, inhabitants of the peaceful Rich Island, and many more. But one group of characters is among Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's best: the animals who Goro Majima can rescue and bring to the \"Goro Animal Kingdom\" on Rich Island.\nRelated\nHow Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii’s Substories Enrich Goro Majima’s Character Arc\nLike a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii’s substories are a pivotal part of the game's overarching narrative, as they help flesh out Majima's character.\nEach Animal Has A Unique Personality And Rescue Scene\nThroughout the game, Goro Majima is given the option to rescue various animals around Hawaii. These range from cats and dogs to birds and even a chimpanzee. Once an animal has been rescued, it moves to the Goro Kingdom, where it can be fed things like Pet Food in exchange for items such as cooking ingredients. However, these animals do more than simply provide Majima with ingredients to use at the Goro Goro Kitchen. Each one has its own distinct personality, shown through its rescue scene and the name Goro or Noah gives it.\nEach animal stands out and truly feels unique. Allure the cat is a fancy, pampered feline previously owned by a hostess, and will only join the Goro Kingdom if Majima approaches her in his Goromi disguise. Gourmand the dog has fancy tastes and will eat only Wild-Caught Sashimi. And CoCo, the chimpanzee whose origins are extremely unclear, is a tricky fellow who will not approach Majima until he has exhausted every available dialogue and action option.\nSeeing Majima interact with, rescue, and name these animals - and later feed them in his Kingdom - is truly heartwarming. It shows a softer side to the rough-and-tumble yakuza turned pirate captain, as he is unfailingly kind and gentle towards every creature he rescues. Even those which give him trouble, like Zoomies the dog - who needs to be chased around Shipper's Wharf before he joins up - are offered a new home in the Goro Kingdom without question. Seeing Majima as an animal lover is a new side to this iconic and beloved character, as Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii truly lets players get to know him in a way they never had before.\nGoro The Tiger Cub Is The Star Of The Show\nOf course, the most iconic and memorable of the many animal characters encountered throughout Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is Goro, the tiger cub who serves as Majima and Noah Rich's companion throughout the game. Goro - who shares a name with Majima out of pure coincidence, as Noah simply thought he \"looked like a Goro\" - is the king of the Goro Kingdom, a benevolent ruler who treats all his subjects with kindness and fairness.\nUnlike the other animals, Goro does not stay in the Kingdom, but accompanies Majima on his journeys throughout Honolulu, Madlantis, and on the open sea. He can help out Majima in many ways: he can catch insects and other ingredients for use in the Goro Goro Kitchen, and even participates in combat. One of the biggest examples of Majima's soft side for animals is the fact that he can dress Goro up to match him, giving him a hat, eye patch, or adorable bow. This adorable tiger cub has quickly become one of the most memorable and popular characters in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, a role he absolutely deserves for his usefulness, adorable relationship with his owners, and cute appearance - especially when dressed up.\n-\nOpenCritic Reviews - Top Critic Rating: 81/100 Critics Recommend: 84%\n- Released\n- February 21, 2025\n- ESRB\n- Mature 17+ // Blood, Intense Violence, Partial Nudity, Sexual Themes, Strong Language, Use of Alcohol\n- Developer(s)\n-\nRyu Ga Gotoku Studio - Publisher(s)\n-\nSega",
