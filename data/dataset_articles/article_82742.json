  "text": "Pursuing further testing, Eman took Zaina to <a href=\"https://account.allinahealth.org/locations/54\">Allina Health Coon Rapids Clinic</a> to see her pediatrician, <a href=\"https://account.allinahealth.org/providers/20145\">Abigail Thomas, DO</a>. Dr. Thomas astutely recommended lab tests to check for gluten intolerance, also known as Celiac Disease. Zaina’s labs showed elevated levels indicating gluten intolerance, but the most accurate way to officially diagnose Celiac Disease is through an endoscopy and biopsy of the intestinal lining.\nAfter the procedure, Zaina’s biopsy confirmed her doctor’s suspicions: she had Celiac Disease. This began the family’s next journey which included revamping Zaina’s diet and removing everything containing gluten from her meals.\n“To be honest, it was the first time I’d ever seen it,” admitted Eman, having never experienced gluten sensitivity or Celiac Disease herself or within her family. Eman realized she wasn’t up to speed on gluten intolerance and began putting in the hard work to learn more. “I started to educate myself to see how we can prevent and improve it.” Eman learned what foods Zaina should avoid and what she should eat, but even after strictly eliminating all gluten in her diet, Zaina’s stomach pain and constipation persisted, and she was having trouble gaining weight.\nA friend of the family referred Eman and Zaina to <a href=\"https://account.allinahealth.org/providers/20365\">Allison Golnik, MD, MPH</a>, a specialist in pediatrics and <a href=\"https://account.allinahealth.org/services/857\">integrative medicine</a> at <a href=\"https://account.allinahealth.org/locations/118\">Allina Health Bandana Square Clinic</a>. Dr. Golnik and the clinic’s functional integrative nutritionist, <a href=\"https://account.allinahealth.org/providers/20238\">Jennifer Barnes, MS, LN</a>, went to work determining how to help Zaina.\nThe team at Allina Health looked at Zaina through a <a href=\"https://account.allinahealth.org/services/857\">functional medicine</a> lens. For celiac disease, this includes having genes for celiac, eating foods with gluten and having increased intestinal permeability. They focused on supporting intestinal permeability and integrity. They used her history and labs to consider vitamin and nutritional deficiencies that could be contributing to her discomfort and constipation.\n“We prescribed supplements to support immune system balancing, energy production, healthy stooling and appetite support,” Dr. Golnik explained. “We also used mucogenic herbs to support gastrointestinal tract integrity and focused on eating foods that support her microbiome and body cells.”\n“Dr. Golnik changed everything for me!” proclaimed Eman. After learning how food impacted Zaina’s cellular health, Eman and her family made huge dietary changes in their home. They got rid of all ultra-processed and junk foods, increased water intake and did more home cooking.\n“From peanut butter to pasta, I changed everything for the whole family,” Eman explained. “It’s a lot of work, but we decided to do it last year and I see a lot of improvement.”\nTwo years later, Zaina is now six years old and in kindergarten. She has spent the last year eating clean, gluten free food, thanks to her mother’s determination and planning. Eman packs her lunches and snacks and keeps up with providing clean food for her family.\nZaina’s constipation and pain are no longer issues, and she is gaining weight well. Eman notes the changes have helped the rest of the family, too. “We know what the problem is now. I haven’t heard any complaining. Nothing.” said Eman.\n“Now I feel much better,” she said. Prior to the changes, Zaina couldn’t participate in many childhood activities due to stomach pain and weakness. Now, she is thriving in gymnastics and swim lessons and enjoying the outdoors.\nTo Eman, seeing her daughter without pain is a relief, and she hopes Zaina’s story can inspire others to look at a holistic perspective of health.",
