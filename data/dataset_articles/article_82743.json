  "text": "PASIR GUDANG, Malaysia , Feb. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Arkema, a leader in specialty materials, has expanded its bio-attributed offer with ISCC PLUS certification of its acrylic and liquid polyester resins (OFPE) production site in Pasir Gudang, Malaysia . This certification is part of the company's global Mass Balance * offer roadmap. It will support its customers across many industries in the region with more sustainable solutions for fast growing application areas including coatings, adhesives for new energies, green mobility, living comfort, infrastructure efficiency and more.\n\" This certification expands the availability of Arkema advanced liquid resins solutions from renewable origin with a lower product carbon footprint. It offers a new range of bio-attributed materials, reinforcing the already existing bio-based resins and additives offer containing up to 100% biobased content, \" said Yoon Hock CHONG - Managing Director ACRM Coating Solutions Southeast Asia.\nThe ISCC PLUS certification of products made at the Arkema manufacturing site in Pasir Gudang follows certifications in the US, in Europe and in China . Arkema's strategy is to progressively introduce a complete range of bio-attributed specialty resins and additives, including high solids, waterborne, UV/LED/EB , and polyester powders.\nTo learn more about mass balance and other ISCC PLUS certifications announcements from Arkema Coating Solutions: Changshu (China) , Nansha (China) , Villers-Saint-Paul ( France ) , Clear Lake (US ), Sant Celoni ( Spain ), Taixing (China) , Carling ( France ) .\n* Mass balance provides manufacturers with a methodology to track the certified materials as they move along the value chain and attribute the inputs of a production process, to outputs of that production process through certified bookkeeping. This distinct accounting method verifies that the certified feedstock has replaced an equivalent quantity of fossil raw materials at the beginning of the supply chain and can be attributed to the product-to-be-sold, ensuring that both input and output are balanced. [source ISCC]\nA bio-attributed content indicates that the use of a biobased feedstock has been ascribed using a mass-balance methodology. The bio-attributed content is the % breakdown based on the ISCC+ methodology calculation. It is a clear distinction to materials in which the biobased content can be verified using the radiocarbon method. [Source Arkema]\nBuilding on its unique set of expertise in materials science, Arkema offers a portfolio of first-class technologies to address evergrowing demand for new and sustainable materials.
