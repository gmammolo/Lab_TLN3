  "text": "A six-women crew including pop star Katy Perry and journalist Gayle King will embark on a trip out of this world in the spring, Blue Origin announced Thursday.\nSkip to end of carousel\nclick here. To subscribe to the Style Memo newsletter,\nclick here.\nKing also announced her involvement in the trip while co-hosting “CBS Mornings” on Thursday, complete with a movie-trailer-esque video.\n“This was never my dream. It was never my dream,” King said. “And somebody said, ‘Maybe you need to have new dreams, Gayle.’ … I don’t know how to explain being terrified and excited at the same time.”\nThe broadcast journalist said she was offered a spot on the trip around Thanksgiving this past year and decided to accept after getting approval from her best friend, Oprah Winfrey, and two kids, Kirby Bumpus and Will Bumpus Jr.\nThe crew is rounded out by Lauren Sánchez, Bezos’s fiancée and the trip’s leader; Aisha Bowe, a Bahamian American aerospace engineer; Amanda Nguyen, a civil rights activist set to be the first Vietnamese woman to travel to space; and Kerianne Flynn, a film producer known for independent movies “Lilly” (2024), “The Automatic Hate” (2015) and “This Changes Everything” (2018).\nBlue Origin didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe New Shepard rocket and spacecraft had traveled to space more than a dozen times without people on board by the time Blue Origin began taking passengers.\nBezos; his younger brother, Mark Bezos; aviator Wally Funk; and Oliver Daemen, who became the youngest space traveler ever, were in the inaugural cohort launched into space in 2021. Since then, the company has flown 52 people into space, including Star Trek actor William Shatner, Shepard’s daughter Laura Shepard Churchley, and television personality and former NFL star Michael Strahan.\nThe spacecraft can carry up to six people to an altitude of more than 60 miles, where they experience a few minutes of weightlessness and view Earth from above the atmosphere. It was temporarily grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration due to an engine failure during an uncrewed launch in 2022, but it was redesigned and resumed flights a little over a year later.\nThe company, based just outside Seattle, has set its sights on expanding space tourism, which Jeff Bezos, a lifelong space enthusiast, has said is “the most important work I’m doing.”\nThis month, the company announced plans to lay off 10 percent of its workforce, cutting the jobs to compete with Elon Musk’s SpaceX.\nChristian Davenport contributed to this report.",
