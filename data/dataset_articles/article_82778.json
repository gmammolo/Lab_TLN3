  "text": "Igor Lednev, a chemist at the University at Albany, is pioneering a new laser-based technology to enhance forensic investigations involving gunshot residue.\nHis research, which combines Raman spectroscopy with machine learning, aims to provide a faster, more accurate, and non-destructive method for analyzing crime scene evidence.\nLednev's work received a significant boost with a $556,572 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice in January. Lednev said,\nGunshot residue is a complex mixture of particles, including partially burned propellant, primer, and cartridge case materials, that is left behind on hands, clothing, and surfaces following a firearm discharge. It provides crucial evidence in shooting-related cases.\nThe current methods for detecting gunshot residue are often costly, time-consuming, and destructive to samples. Lednev's technology, however, offers a unique solution.\nRaman spectroscopy, a non-destructive chemical analysis, shines monochromatic light on a sample and measures the scattered radiation, producing a unique spectrum akin to a fingerprint.\nThis method allows for nearly instantaneous results while preserving the sample for future testing.\nThe DOJ funding will enable Lednev's lab to test their technique on gunshot residue trapped in common fabrics, which are frequently overlooked in investigations.\nThe research will expand to include small traces of evidence from other surfaces, collected using adhesive methods. Lednev said,\nWe have developed a two-step method for the detection and identification of gunshot residue, first using a highly sensitive fluorescence hyperspectral imaging of a sample area to detect potential particles, followed by confirmatory identification of particles using Raman spectroscopy. Once identification is achieved, we can further our analysis including determining other important information such as the type of ammunition and/or ammunition manufacturer.\nLednev's team, which includes several UAlbany graduate students, plans to develop a portable instrument for on-site crime scene analysis. Lednev said,\nConsidering that handheld Raman spectroscopic instruments are already commercially available, we envision our technology will become portable in the future and put into the hands of investigators at crime scenes.\nThe National Institute of Justice grant will support Lednev's research for the next five years, in collaboration with the New York State Police Forensic Investigation Center in Albany and the Onondaga County Center for Forensic Sciences in Syracuse.\nLednev's lab has been at the forefront of using Raman spectroscopy for forensic purposes for over a decade, with continuous funding from the NIJ, over 60 peer-reviewed articles, and three U.S. patents.\nSupreMEtric LLC, a startup founded by Lednev, focuses on identifying body fluid traces at crime scenes and has received over $1 million from the National Science Foundation to commercialize the technology. Lednev said,\nWe have made significant progress in the development of another tool that can detect and identify body fluid traces for forensic purposes. SupreMEtric LLC is commercializing this patented technology now. We’d like to see our body fluid and gun residue analysis combined into a single instrument, making it a really powerful forensic tool.",
