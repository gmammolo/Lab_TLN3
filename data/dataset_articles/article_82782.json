  "text": "Black Salt Games has announced that Dredge has become available on iOS and Android from today: the game can be downloaded for free from the App Store and Google Play, and you can try it before you decide whether to purchase a full version.\nThe development team has reduced the price of the game exactly twice to launch, that is, now its unlock on iOS will cost 14.99 euros, and on Android – a little cheaper – 12.99 euros.\nIn addition to the Dredge basic campaign, the mobile version also gives access to its two additions, namely The Pale Reach and The Iron Rig, which add new scenarios and cost 4.99 and 9.99 euros, respectively.\nThe developers published a video demonstrating the sensory system for managing the mobile version of the game, which looks rather honed.",
