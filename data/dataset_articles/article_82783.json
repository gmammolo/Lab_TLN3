  "text": "Exciting Drill Results at CV5 Pegmatite Boost Feasibility Study Plans\nHenry TurnerUpdated: 02-27-2025 05:12 PM\nSignificant Developments at the CV5 Pegmatite\nRecent drilling at the CV5 pegmatite has revealed wide, high-grade intercepts that are set to support the upcoming feasibility study and maiden ore reserve estimates from Patriot Battery Metals Inc. This impressive data comes from their extensive summer and fall 2024 in-fill drill program, which focused on the lithium-rich pegmatite.\nOverview of Drill Results\nHighlights from the program include notable intersections such as 153.8 meters at 2.00% Li2O, comprising a high-grade segment of 55.4 meters at 3.42% Li2O (CV24-733). Other significant intercepts reported are:\n- 142.9 meters at 1.77% Li2O, with highlights of 35.2 meters at 3.36% Li2O (CV24-719).\n- 186.0 meters at 1.08% Li2O, including 11.3 meters at 4.27% Li2O (CV24-704).\n- 129.8 meters at 1.36% Li2O, featuring 22.4 meters at 2.45% Li2O (CV24-688).\n- 142.3 meters at 1.12% Li2O, with a segment of 55.2 meters at 2.19% Li2O (CV24-769).\n- Additional intercepts of 118.4 meters at 1.27% Li2O, 101.9 meters at 1.75% Li2O, and many more are also reported.\nCompletion of the Drill Campaign\nThe recent batch of assay results from 98 drill holes, totaling 31,513 meters, concludes the data collection from a total of 431 holes, which sum up to 128,052 meters. These assays are essential for preparing the feasibility study along with inadequate ore reserve estimates for the CV5 pegmatite, targeted for completion in Q3-2025. The team at Patriot is thrilled to confirm that all necessary resource, geotechnical, and hydrogeological drilling is complete.\nPatriot’s Achievements in Lithium Exploration\nAs of now, Patriot Battery Metals has successfully executed 793 drill holes across the Shaakichiuwaanaan Property, accumulating over 233,884 meters of drilling effort. This makes it possible to claim the largest hard rock lithium resource in the Americas in less than three years, showcasing the company's commitment to innovation and exploration.\nExpert Insights\nDarren L. Smith, Vice President of Exploration at Patriot, expressed optimism regarding the drill program's results. He shared, \"The fall 2024 in-fill drill program at CV5 ended robustly, resulting in over ten well-mineralized intercepts exceeding 100 meters. Achieving this milestone on schedule and under budget demonstrates our team's dedication and efficiency.\" He also mentioned the collaboration with independent consultants, progressing geological models to support the forthcoming mineral resource update.\nMoving Forward: The Road to Feasibility Study\nThe outcomes of these drills not only enhance resource confidence but also lay the groundwork for the feasibility study alongside the maiden ore reserve for the CV5 pegmatite. Mr. Smith emphasized, “Our plans remain on target for Q3-2025, aiming to present a mineral resource update that reflects this exciting phase of development for Patriot Battery Metals.”\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the significance of the recent drill results at CV5?\nThe drill results provide critical data necessary for the feasibility study, indicating substantial lithium mineralization, which is crucial for planning future mining activities.\nWhen will the feasibility study results be released?\nThe feasibility study is scheduled for completion in Q3-2025, following the recent drill assessments and data collection.\nHow many drill holes have been completed at CV5?\nA total of 431 drill holes have been executed at CV5, amounting to 128,052 meters of drilling.\nWho is Darren L. Smith?\nDarren L. Smith is the Vice President of Exploration at Patriot Battery Metals, overseeing the exploration and development projects at the CV5 pegmatite and other sites.\nWhat is the next step for Patriot Battery Metals?\nFollowing the completion of drilling, the focus will shift to data analysis and preparing for the feasibility study and ore reserve estimates for the next phases of the CV5 project.\nAbout The Author\nContact Henry Turner privately here.
