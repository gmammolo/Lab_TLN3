  "text": "There are many AI tools targeted at learning, and surprisingly, Google's AI Studio isn't one of them. But don't be mistaken; AI Studio is a fantastic learning tool. I gave it a try to be my personal tutor, and I was blown away.\nWhat Is Google's AI Studio?\nGoogle's AI Studio is an all-in-one web-based platform that allows developers to build and experiment with different large language models (LLMs) from Google powered by Gemini. If you've heard of Gemini, Google's competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT, you're halfway there in understanding what AI Studio is all about.\nWhile the platform targets developers building products using different APIs from Google's Gemini LLM, AI Studio's web-based nature means you don't need to be a developer like me to experience its fantastic features.\nAI Studio has several features available, including the ability to ask questions and tune your AI model. It also has a unique feature called Stream Realtime that allows live interaction with Gemini in different ways, including text, voice, video, and even screen sharing. The latter makes AI Studio one of the many\nessential AI tools students need.\nUsing Google's AI Studio as My Tutor\nThe key feature that I use to make AI Studio my tutor is Stream Realtime. With its live interaction capabilities, using Stream Realtime for learning is like having a professional expert beside you. To get started, select Stream Realtime in the left tab of AI Studio.\nWith this tab selected, AI Studio provides three main options: talk to Gemini, show Gemini what you're looking at via the webcam, or share your screen. Of course, you can also type something in the chat for text-based interaction, but I prefer screen sharing as it makes the experience more interactive and personalized, which is crucial for learning.\nLet's say you want to learn to do simple calculations on Google Sheets. The first thing you'll do is open a sheet with sample data in Google Sheets in a different tab. Then, you select the Share your screen option in the Stream Realtime tab. Afterward, select an appropriate option for sharing: a tab, window, or the whole screen. At the same time, ensure you grant Gemini permission to access your microphone for audio input. Then, open the Google Sheet tab.\nOnce you do that, confirm if Gemini can see your screen by talking directly to your device. After the confirmation, you can ask Gemini anything you need help with in the spreadsheet, and it will give you step-by-step instructions on how to do it.\nFor instance, you can see Gemini confirming that it can see my screen above and is even smart enough to tell that I have a spreadsheet open.\nAfter that, you can ask Gemini anything you want to do in the spreadsheet, and it'll guide you just like an expert sitting next to you would. While you can already\nuse Gemini in Google Sheets, AI Studio is better than the built-in integration. The only downside as of this writing is Google limits sessions to ten minutes, which can be limiting depending on what you need help with.\nAI Studio Is an Incredible Tool for Both Learning and Work\nThe example I've used above for learning how to do calculations in Google Sheets is just an example. The fact that AI Studio can see your screen means it can help you with almost anything. For instance, if you work as an accountant, you can use some help from AI Studio to guide you in performing some tasks.\nIf you're a student, AI Studio's live interaction feature can help you understand scientific papers more easily and even sharpen your presentation skills. All you need to do is share what you're working on using Stream Realtime's screen-sharing feature, and Gemini will offer assistance with nearly everything you may need help with on your device.\nRelated\nGoogle's Gemini Is Underrated, and There Are 5 Reasons to Try It Out\nDon't sleep on Google Gemini and its extensive set of features.\nAfter using Google's AI Studio to learn how to perform calculations in Google Sheets and decipher scientific papers on LLMs full of jargon, I can vouch for it as an indispensable tool for learning almost anything. The next time I want to learn something new, I'll incorporate AI Studio to make the process easier and more enjoyable.",
