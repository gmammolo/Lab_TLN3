  "text": "GlobalFoundries has expanded its work with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on silicon photonics.\nThis follows ST’s entry into the silicon photonics market for AI chips to use photonic interconnect to reduce power consumption and increase interconnect performance.\nThe new master research agreement will cover critical semiconductor technologies at the MIT’s Microsystems Technology Laboratories (MTL) and GF’s research and development team, GF Labs.\nThe initial research focus is on AI and other applications with the first projects using GF’s differentiated silicon photonics technology, which monolithically integrates RF SOI, CMOS, and optical features on a single chip with its 22FDX platform for ultra-low power consumption for intelligent devices at the edge.\nGF is also currently producing the Omega photonic chipset for PsiQuantum to build a quantum computer with a million qubits.\nST heads back into silicon photonics with mass production at Crolles “The collaboration between MIT MTL and GF exemplifies the power of academia-industry cooperation in tackling the most pressing challenges in semiconductor research,” said Tomás Palacios, MTL Director and Clarence J. LeBel Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Palacios will serve as the MIT faculty lead for this research initiative.\n“By bringing together MIT’s world-renowned capabilities with GF’s leading semiconductor platforms, we are positioned to drive significant research advancements in GF’s essential chip technologies for AI,” said Gregg Bartlett, chief technology officer at GF. “This collaboration underscores our commitment to innovation and highlights our dedication to developing the next generation of talent in the semiconductor industry. Together, we will research transformative solutions in the industry.”\n“This collaboration allows MIT’s exceptional research community to leverage GlobalFoundries’s wide range of industry domain experts and advanced process technologies to drive exciting innovations in microelectronics across domains—while preparing our students to take on leading roles in the workforce of the future,” said Prof Anantha Chandrakasan, dean of MIT’s School of Engineering and chief innovation and strategy officer.\nMIT staff are active participants in GF’s University Partnership Program focused on joint semiconductor research and prototyping and the two work together in several workforce development initiatives, including through the Northeast Microelectronics Coalition, a US Department of Defense Microelectronics Commons Hub.\nmtl.mit.edu",
