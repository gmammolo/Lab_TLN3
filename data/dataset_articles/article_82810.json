  "text": "Hades 2's early access has so content on offer that it almost feels like a completed game. Like its predecessor, Hades 2 includes many small references and Easter Eggs from Greek mythology, but it also includes several references to its own canon, which diverges from commonly established Greek myths at times to avoid some awkward scenarios. This isn't a problem, as there are many differing versions of Greek myths, and Supergiant's own version doesn't directly contradict anything from the original myths. It does, however, introduce a seemingly original character in the form of the Supportive Shade.\nThe Supportive Shade is a recurring character in Hades, and appears in the arena in Elysium as the only shade that consistently supports Zagreus. In Hades 2's Warsong Update, the Supportive Shade makes a return in the Fields of Mourning, where Melinoe can speak to them and acknowledges them as the same shade. As Persephone's father was a mortal farmer, there's a popular fan theory that the Supportive Shade is Zagreus and Melinoe's maternal grandfather, an idea which may be explored in Hades 2.\nRelated\nHades 2: 5 Most Teased Events For the Full Release\nA list of events that may or may not be fated for Hades 2.\nSupergiant's Hades and Myth\nOne particular myth that has several deviations in Greek mythology is the matter of Persephone's parents. While her mother is always Demeter, the goddess of the seasons, her father changes depending on the origin of the myth, with her father usually being either Zeus or a random mortal man. Supergiant's canon for Hades has Persephone being the child of Demeter and a mortal man, making Zagreus and Melinoe a quarter mortal. Zagreus' mortality is evident in that he bleeds red blood, rather than the golden ichor more typical of the gods, and is designated as the God of Blood and Life.\nThe Supportive Shade is first encountered in Hades when Zagreus fights Theseus in Elysium's arena. The Supportive Shade is the only shade in the crowd who consistently supports Zagreus, and has a banner of Zagreus it brandishes in support of him. The Supportive Shade makes a reappearance in Hades 2 in the Fields of Mourning after Melinoe's battle with Cerberus, and appears close to the exit. Melinoe acknowledges that the shade used to dwell in Elysium, and can interact with them on subsequent runs. Eventually, Melinoe can invite the Supportive Shade to the Crossroads.\nThe Supportive Shade in Hades 2\nThe Supportive Shade made their reappearance within the Warsong Update. Alongside this update came new decorations for the Crossroads called \"Toolset, Farmer's\", with the description, \"Claimed to have once belonged to a mortal farmer who knew the goddess of the seasons\". This is very likely a reference to Zagreus and Melinoe's mortal grandfather. When selected, Melinoe doesn't show any recognition that these could have been her grandfather's, and doesn't seem to be aware that her grandfather was a mortal at all.\nTo bring back the Supportive Shade in the same update that introduced a Crossroads upgrade that references Melinoe's grandfather could be a coincidence, but it does give credibility to the popular fan theory that the Supportive Shade is Zagreus and Melinoe's mortal grandfather. As the main conflict of Hades 2 is about defeating their other grandfather, the Titan of Time, it would be wonderfully charming for Melinoe to have her other grandfather offer her unconditional love and support. Melinoe is known in the myths as a goddess of shades and, as the rest of her immediate family has been locked away, having her develop a connection with her mortal grandfather as a shade would be a great reference to her special connection with shades, while simoltaneously giving her a part of her family back.\n-\nOpenCritic Reviews - Top Critic Rating: 90/100 Critics Recommend: 100%\n- Released\n- May 6, 2024\n- ESRB\n- t\n- Developer(s)\n-\nSupergiant Games - Publisher(s)\n-\nSupergiant Games",
