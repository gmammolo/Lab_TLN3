  "text": "Full episode: Apple's biggest product releases through the years Apple’s marketing machine is almost as effective as its skilled engineers. In this LiveNOW & Then episode, we look back at how the media has covered the tech company, from its IPO in 1980 to its iconic status today.\nApple products have reached a certain stratosphere among consumers, a level that&apos;s enviable and somewhat unattainable by other technology firms.\nWhen Apple pushes a product, consumers immediately flock to stores to grab it – so much so that crowds attract media attention. It&apos;s not only because of their design, but how Apple products have seemingly revolutionized everyday life.\nTimeline:\nHere&apos;s a look at the list of Apple products through the decades and how they transformed daily life:\nJune 1977, the Apple II From the archives: Apple Computer's 1980 IPO Apple went public back on December 12, 1980. Here's a look back at KTVU-TV's coverage of the event, along with a look at how Apple II computers were being used in the classroom -- a novelty at the time.\nThe Apple II was an improved version of the Apple I computer kit, and started the boom in personal computer sales, according to the National Museum of American History .\nIt was also the first computer to be widely used in schools across the U.S. For millions of today&apos;s adults, their first experience with a computer of any kind came with a version of the Apple II in their classroom – often playing Oregon Trail, Carmen Sandiego, or Odell Lake.\nJanuary 1984, the Macintosh Computer Apple Macintosh computer in 1984 (Credit: KTTV)\nHeralded by a now-most famous TV commercial , the Macintosh computer lived up to the revolutionary promise made by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs during its 1984 unveiling. Among other things, the Mac ushered in the era of the graphical user interface (known as \"GUI\" in tech parlance) and the mouse.\nIn many ways, it was the first realization of Jobs’ vision to turn computers into \"a bicycle of the mind.\"\nAugust 1998, the iMac From the archives: Reviewing the iMac in 1999 We now know Apple's all-in-one iMac marked an important milestone for the company. But what did people think of the colorful computer back when it debuted? Here's a look at FOX 2 Detroit's hands-on review of the iMac. Originally aired December 20, 1999.\nApple redesigned the desktop computer when it released the iMac. The all-in-one colorful egg stood out in bright contrast to the beige, rectangular PCs that Apple was competing with, and was one of the first products that helped rebrand Apple as a hip alternative for a new generation.\nFrom a technical perspective, it was the first mainstream computer that did not include the traditional floppy disk drive. Instead, it was an early adopter of the USB port.\nOctober 2001, the iPod Although it wasn’t the first of its kind, the iPod changed the way people thought about digital music players just like Jimi Hendrix changed the way people thought about the guitar.\nThe iPod was compact, stylish, and initially capable of storing up to 1,000 songs (the capacity would extend far beyond that of the first model in 2001).\nApple Computer Inc. unveiled a new portable music player, the iPod MP3 music player October 23, 2001 at an event in Cupertino, Calif. (Photo Courtesy of Apple Corp. via Getty Images)\nExpand It then spawned the iTunes store, which provided a legal way to buy and download music at a time of rampant MP3 piracy. The device also signaled Apple might evolve into something more than a computer maker.\nJanuary 2007, the iPhone A customer walks into the new Apple store holding a picture of Tim Cook as she is welcomed by the store staff at the Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) on June 22, 2024, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.(Photo by Annice Lyn/Getty Images)\nIt’s difficult to overstate how much the iPhone has changed the world. In technical terms, it introduced the convenience of touchscreens at the time that a physical keyboard was still all the rage on the top-selling smartphone – the BlackBerry – when Jobs first took out what was all-in-one computer, camera and music player out of his pocket in 2007.\nA year later, Apple would open a store that would make it common to think there must be an app for just about anything, render the BlackBerry obsolete and make smartphones indispensable.\nRELATED: Apple reportedly working on foldable and thinner iPhone models\nSeptember 2014, the Apple Watch The Apple Watch created a device that made it possible to wear something akin to a smartphone on your wrist because it included cellular capability.\nIt also offered some of the same apps people use on their smartphones. Apple initially marketed its smartwatch almost like a fashion accessory before pivoting once it realized that its fitness and health-tracking features were the tools that people seemed to find most valuable.\nApple announces new AI features for iPhone, Mac Artificial intelligence expert Phil Siegel joins LiveNOW's Andrew Craft to discuss Apple's new AI features for its products.\nRELATED: Watch: Apple Watch SOS alert leads rescuers to injured skiers after 1,000-foot fall\nSeptember 2016, Airpods The AirPods helped popularize wireless headphones with an Apple chip that provided more reliable and stable connections with devices while making it easy to shift from one gadget to another.\nThe product also served another key purpose for Apple: AirPods quickly muted the initial outrage of the company’s decision to remove the headphone jack from iPhones in 2016 while creating another lucrative sales channel.\nApple's influence on generations Big picture view:\nApple has a long history of designing products that aren’t the first to be introduced in a particular category but still redefine the market.\nFOX 4&apos;s Steve Noviello has covered consumer products and said Apple has garnered a brand loyalty that none of its competitors have achieved, even though they push similar products.\n\"I use my iPhone or really any phone at this point to make payments,\" he said in an interview with FOX Television Stations. \"I pay my mortgage on it. I book my airline travel. I send pictures, I take pictures, I communicate with people. It monitors my heart health.\n\"I mean, it really is amazing what technology has done,\" he continued.",
