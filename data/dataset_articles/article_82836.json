  "text": "SNK has announced one of its beloved fighting games from The King of Fighters franchise is coming to PS5 with trophy support. Additionally, players that already own it can upgrade to the new version for a couple bucks.\nThe King of Fighters 98 gets PS5 version with trophies ACA2NEOGEO The King of Fighters ’98 is available on PS5 today. The ACA2NEOGEO series from SNK attempts to faithfully recreate some of its best arcade games. This particular version actually has a Network Mode that allows players to fight online, which was not available in the ACA version of the game for PS4.\n“The King of Fighters ’98 is a fighting game released by SNK in 1998,” reads the official description. “In the previous installment KOF ’97, the story of the ‘Orochi Saga’ reached its exciting conclusion. As a result, the next entry in the series The King of Fighters ’98 was released as a dream match version of The King of Fighters Series. It is one of the most popular and well known versions of the game, partially thanks to the many balance changes that received high praise from fans around the world.”\nPS5 players that don’t currently own King of Fighters 98 can grab the game on the PS Store for $9.99. However, owners of the PS4 version can get the game for just $2.99.\nArguably more important than online functionality is trophy support. The PS5 version of The King of Fighters 98 has trophies, including the coveted Platinum.\nThe King of Fighters 98 PS5 Trophy List Unlock All Trophies (Platinum) ORIGINAL MODE START (Bronze) [ORIGINAL MODE] Score 50,000 points (Bronze) [ORIGINAL MODE] Score 100,000 points (Silver) [ORIGINAL MODE] Score 150,000 points (Gold) HI SCORE MODE START (Bronze) [HI SCORE MODE] Score 30,000 points (Bronze) [HI SCORE MODE] Score 50,000 points (Silver) [HI SCORE MODE] Score 100,000 points (Gold) HI SCORE MODE Player (Gold) CARAVAN MODE START (Bronze) [CARAVAN MODE] Score 40,000 points (Bronze) [CARAVAN MODE] Score 60,000 points (Silver) [CARAVAN MODE] Score 80,000 points (Gold) CARAVAN MODE Player (Gold) TIME ATTACK MODE START (Bronze) CheckPoint 2 (Bronze) CheckPoint 3 (Silver) CheckPoint 4 (Gold) TIME ATTACK MODE Player (Gold) Register in all modes (Gold)",
