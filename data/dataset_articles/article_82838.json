The company is releasing a research preview of GPT‑4.5 that’s a step forward in scaling up pre-training and post-training. The latest model improves its ability to recognize patterns, draw connections, and generate creative insights without reasoning.\nOpenAI revealed that as per early testing, interacting with GPT‑4.5 feels more natural. It has broader knowledge base, improved ability to follow user intent, and greater “EQ” make it useful for tasks like improving writing, programming, and solving practical problems.\nGPT‑4.5 as a research preview\n“We also expect it to hallucinate less. We’re sharing GPT‑4.5 as a research preview to better understand its [strengths](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/operator-openai-phd-level-super-agent) and limitations,” said the company in a statement.\n“We’re still exploring what it’s capable of and are eager to see how people use it in ways we might not have expected.”\nThe company advanced AI capabilities by scaling two complementary paradigms, unsupervised learning and reasoning.\nScaling reasoning teaches models to think and produce a chain of thought\nOpenAI revealed that scaling [reasoning](https://interestingengineering.com/culture/openai-accuses-deepseek-of-data-theft) teaches models to think and produce a chain of thought before they respond, allowing them to tackle complex STEM or logic problems. Models like OpenAI o1 and OpenAI o3‑mini advance this paradigm. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, increases world model accuracy and intuition, according to [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-4-5/).\nThe company underlined that GPT‑4.5 is an example of scaling unsupervised learning by scaling up compute and data, along with architecture and optimization innovations.\nBroader knowledge and deeper understanding\nThe result is a model that has broader knowledge and a deeper understanding of the world, leading to reduced hallucinations and more reliability across a wide range of topics, as per the OpenAI.\n“As we scale our models and they solve more complex problems, it becomes increasingly important to teach them a greater understanding of human needs and intent,” said the company.\n“For GPT‑4.5, we developed new, scalable techniques that enable training larger and more powerful models with data derived from smaller models. These techniques improve GPT‑4.5’s steerability, understanding of nuance, and natural conversation.”\nOpen AI also revealed that GPT‑4.5 has a better understanding of what humans mean and interprets subtle cues or implicit expectations with greater nuance and “EQ”. GPT‑4.5 also shows stronger aesthetic intuition and creativity. It excels at helping with writing and design, according to the company.\nRECOMMENDED ARTICLES\n“GPT-4.5 is ready! good news: It is the first model that feels like talking to a thoughtful person to me. i have had several moments where i’ve sat back in my chair and been astonished at getting actually good advice from an AI,” [said](https://x.com/sama/status/1895203654103351462?s=46) Sam Altman.\nHe also revealed that it is a giant, expensive model.\n“We really wanted to launch it to plus and pro at the same time, but we’ve been growing a lot and are out of GPUs. we will add tens of thousands of GPUs next week and roll it out to the plus tier then. (hundreds of thousands coming soon, and i’m pretty sure y’all will use every one we can rack up),” added Altman.\nABOUT THE EDITOR\n[Prabhat Ranjan Mishra](https://interestingengineering.com/author/prabhat-ranjan-mishra) Prabhat, an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication, is a tech and defense journalist.
