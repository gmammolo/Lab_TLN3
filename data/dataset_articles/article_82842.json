  "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Exabits, the baselayer for AI compute for enterprises and a supplier to decentralized cloud compute companies and GAIB, the first economic layer for AI and compute financialization, creating a new type of yield bearing assets backed by real AI demands, today announced a strategic partnership to revolutionize how GPU infrastructure is acquired, scaled, and monetized. By combining Exabits' high-performance AI compute technology with GAIB's tokenized GPU investment platform, this partnership will unlock new capital flows, expand GPU accessibility, and provide investors with a direct stake in the growing AI compute economy.\nThe collaboration addresses a critical challenge in AI and cloud computing-the high cost and limited access to high-performance GPUs. With demand for AI compute skyrocketing, Exabits and GAIB are introducing a scalable investment model that allows institutions, enterprises, and investors to participate in the growth of AI compute infrastructure through tokenized GPU assets.\nTransforming GPU Compute into a High-Value Investment Asset\nGPUs are the core infrastructure powering AI, machine learning, and high-performance computing, yet access remains concentrated among a few large cloud providers. The Exabits-GAIB partnership introduces a new financial model that enables:",
