  "text": "OpenAI on Thursday released a research preview of GPT‑4.5—our largest and best model for chat yet. GPT‑4.5 is a step forward in scaling up pre-training and post-training, OpenAI says in a blog post. By scaling unsupervised learning, GPT‑4.5 improves its ability to recognize patterns, draw connections, and generate creative insights without reasoning.\nOpenAI:\nEarly testing shows that interacting with GPT‑4.5 feels more natural. Its broader knowledge base, improved ability to follow user intent, and greater “EQ” make it useful for tasks like improving writing, programming, and solving practical problems. We also expect it to hallucinate less.\nWe’re sharing GPT‑4.5 as a research preview to better understand its strengths and limitations. We’re still exploring what it’s capable of and are eager to see how people use it in ways we might not have expected.\nGPT‑4.5 is an example of scaling unsupervised learning by scaling up compute and data, along with architecture and optimization innovations. The result is a model that has broader knowledge and a deeper understanding of the world, leading to reduced hallucinations and more reliability across a wide range of topics.\nCombining deep understanding of the world with improved collaboration results in a model that integrates ideas naturally in warm and intuitive conversations that are more attuned to human collaboration. GPT‑4.5 has a better understanding of what humans mean and interprets subtle cues or implicit expectations with greater nuance and “EQ”. GPT‑4.5 also shows stronger aesthetic intuition and creativity. It excels at helping with writing and design…\nWith every new order of magnitude of compute comes novel capabilities. GPT‑4.5 is a model at the frontier of what is possible in unsupervised learning. We continue to be surprised by the creativity of the community in uncovering new abilities and unexpected use cases. With GPT‑4.5, we invite you to explore the frontier of unsupervised learning and uncover novel capabilities with us.\nMacDailyNews Note: Starting today, ChatGPT Pro users will be able to select GPT‑4.5 in the model picker on web, mobile, and desktop. OpenAI will begin rolling out to Plus and Team users next week, then to Enterprise and Edu users the following week.\nPlease help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.
