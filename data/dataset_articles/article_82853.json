  "text": "Skywatchers are in for a spectacular celestial event this week as seven planets—Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Venus, Neptune, Mercury, and Saturn—briefly align in the evening sky.\nThis rare phenomenon, known as a planetary parade, will not be visible this clearly again until 2040.\nThe best chance to witness this stunning alignment will be just after sunset on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.\nOf the seven planets, four—Venus, Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury—will be visible to the naked eye.\nVenus and Jupiter, the brightest of the group, will be the easiest to spot, while Mars will stand out with its signature reddish glow. Saturn, positioned low on the horizon, may be trickier to see, and Uranus and Neptune will require a telescope for a clear view.\nAlthough the planets will be aligned, the window of visibility will be brief, so timing is essential.\nDr. Edward Bloomer, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, explained, “There’s a rare opportunity to have seven planets in essentially a convenient place for you to look for them.”\nHowever, the alignment won’t last long. As the sun sets, Saturn and Mercury will quickly set behind the horizon, making them particularly difficult to spot.\n“You really only have a few minutes after sunset to catch them before they drop below the horizon,” Dr. Bloomer added.\nAfter that, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars will remain visible for a much longer time.\nFor the best view, it’s recommended to head to a location with a clear, unobstructed horizon and minimal light pollution. Given the timing of the event, skywatchers should plan to be in place just after sunset for the best chance to see all seven planets in their brief alignment.\nThis planetary parade provides a rare opportunity to witness the mechanics of our solar system in action, with planets orbiting the Sun within a similar flat plane.\nAs they orbit at different speeds and distances from the Sun, their alignment appears as a stunning visual display, even though they are separated by vast distances in space.\nThe planets’ orbital paths often align from Earth’s perspective, offering us a fleeting but unforgettable glimpse of the solar system’s structure.\nSource: Express Tribune",
