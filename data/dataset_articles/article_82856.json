  "text": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo. , Feb. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Innospec (NASDAQ: IOSP), a leading global specialty chemicals company, today announces a partnership with UNESCO International Institute for Higher Education (IESALC) to launch an educational program aimed at improving access to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education for indigenous students in Brazil . The main outcome of the project will consist of a course on sustainable development and STEM – co-designed by indigenous and non-indigenous students and researchers—integrating indigenous knowledge and science applied to sustainability practices to empower diverse voices in STEM education. This initiative will directly train 40 indigenous students, with its ripple effects benefiting an additional 200 individuals.\nAccording to 2022 data from IBGE and INEP, more than 46,000 indigenous people were enrolled in higher education which is almost five times the number recorded in 2011. However, despite this significant improvement, indigenous voices remain underrepresented in Brazil’s educational system.\nBy collaborating with the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil , the program responds to the objectives expressed by indigenous students during the recent Regional Conference on Higher Education (CRES+5) for more involvement in STEM education. This aim is aligned with the UN’s new Pact for the Future , which emphasizes protecting and enhancing indigenous knowledge.\nVali Jerome, President of Fuel Specialties at Innospec said, “We have operated in Brazil since 2011 and today employ more than 300 people. As a STEM-focused employer, we are pleased that the number of indigenous university students is increasing. We are honored to work alongside UNESCO to continue to broaden STEM education, training and professional opportunities for indigenous students in Brazil.”\nFind out more about this partnership here: https://innospecsustainability.com/social/key-social-partnerships/supporting-indigenous-stem-education-in-latin-america/\nAbout Innospec Inc.\nInnospec Inc. is an international specialty chemicals company with approximately 2,400 employees in 22 countries.
