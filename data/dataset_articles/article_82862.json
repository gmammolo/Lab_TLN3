  "text": "Topline Artificial intelligence powerhouse OpenAI announced its latest chat model Thursday, starting a limited roll out of GPT-4.5, which OpenAI chief Sam Altman called a “giant” and “expensive” model that “feels like talking to a thoughtful person.”\nKey Facts OpenAI called GPT-4.5 its “largest and most knowledgeable model yet” in a document summarizing the new chatbot, saying user interaction with it feels more natural.\nOpenAI said the new model features a broader knowledge base, better emotional intelligence and improved contextual understanding, noting the improvements make it well-suited for problem-solving, writing and programming tasks.\nThe new model supposedly has fewer hallucinations— a common euphemism for when AI models produce inaccurate or misleading results.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts : We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\nHow Powerful Is Gpt-4.5? GPT-4.5 has more than 10 times the amount of computational efficiency of GPT-4, according to the document, which means it takes less time and resources to solve a problem.\nWho Can Use Gpt-4.5? GPT-4.5 is only available to users subscribed to ChatGPT Pro, a $200 per month plan that gives users the highest level of access to OpenAI’s products. Altman said in a tweet OpenAI wanted to launch the new model on the ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Pro plans simultaneously, but could not due to a shortage of graphics processing units needed to support such a rollout. Altman added OpenAI will add tens of thousands of GPUs next week, allowing for GPT-4.5 to become available on the ChatGPT Plus plan, which is $20 per month.\nForbes Valuation We estimate Altman’s net worth at $1.1 billion , a figure established through the CEO’s investments in Reddit, Stripe and fusion power company Helion.\nKey Background The release of GPT-4.5 comes a little less than two years after OpenAI launched GPT-4 and just a few weeks after the company revealed “ Operator ,” an AI assistant designed to carry out tasks on the internet for users like grocery orders, ticket purchases and lecture downloads. OpenAI is also eyeing a funding round that could double its value to an eye-popping $340 billion. The funding round, if completed, would place OpenAI’s valuation far above competitors like the Elon Musk-owned xAI (valued at roughly $50 billion) and Amazon-backed AI firm Anthropic, which valued at $18 billion and is reportedly in talks for a funding round that would boost its valuation to $60 billion.\nFurther Reading OpenAI Eyeing Funding Round That Would Double Its Value, Report Says (Forbes)\nOpenAI’s ‘Operator’: What We Know About New AI Assistant Capable Of Ordering Groceries, Making Reservations (Forbes)\nWhat We Know About XAI As It Bolsters Itself For AI Race—With $6 Billion In New Funding (Forbes)",
