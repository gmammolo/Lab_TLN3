  "text": "MWC25 Barcelona is set to showcase groundbreaking advancements in AI, 5G and the future of mobile connectivity. As the world’s top telecom leaders, innovators and tech giants gather next week, all eyes will be on how artificial intelligence is reshaping the industry — from AI-driven networks to the next generation of edge computing.\nOne of the most anticipated developments this year is the growing role of telcos in AI edge applications, a shift that could redefine their business models. Industry players, including Qualcomm Inc., Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp., are gearing up to demonstrate how AI and 5G are converging to unlock new revenue opportunities, streamline networks and accelerate innovation. This includes the launch of a new alliance this month involving firms such as Qualcomm Inc. and Intel Corp. to facilitate an open, harmonized and aligned ecosystem for IoT.\nIndustry observers, such as Chris Lewis , founder and managing director of Lewis Insight Ltd., have seen an evolution in the telco industry as the influence of IT expands. “We used to be an industry that was always self-contained,” Lewis said in an interview with theCUBE. “What the IT world is teaching us, the cloud world is teaching us and the AI world is teaching us is that you’ve got to be more open.”\nTheCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio, will be in Barcelona for coverage of MWC25 Barcelona March 3-6. TheCUBE’s coverage will include interviews with key industry executives and analysts who will explore the intersection of hardware innovation with the rise of edge devices, while examining the latest mobile tech in AI, 5G, IoT and sustainability. (* Disclosure below.)\nSpotlight on AI edge at MWC25 A key development that will be closely followed at MWC this year is the role of telcos in what is expected to be an explosion in AI edge applications . The growth of AI at the edge received further attention earlier this month when Cisco Systems Inc. Chief Executive Chuck Robbins noted during an earnings call that European telco operators were looking to deliver AI as-a-service and that “we see of lot of them planning for AI edge applications.”\nDelivery of AI applications at the edge will require processors to handle the workloads. Along with network powerhouses such as Cisco Systems Inc., silicon providers will likely be in the spotlight at MWC as well. At last year’s gathering, chipmakers Qualcomm Technologies Inc. and Broadcom Inc. were significant participants, demonstrating new capabilities in areas such as mmWave deployment for 5G and software-defined edge technologies for telcos.\nChip giant Nvidia Corp. is expected to expand on its own telco-based initiatives. During its November AI Summit in Japan, Nvidia revealed that SoftBank Group had successfully piloted the world’s first combined AI and 5G telecom network using the chipmaker’s AI Aerial accelerated computing platform. This advancement could open revenue streams potentially worth billions to telecom operators if they can generate inference revenue from an AI-based radio access network, according to Nvidia.\n“Service provider success is critical to the health of the tech sector,” said Zeus Kerravala , principal analyst at ZK Research. “Over the past several decades, the telcos have been continually marginalized to the point where most of their services are considered commodities. With the rise of cloud, mobility and AI, the world has become network-centric, putting service providers in their strongest position for a long time.”\nTheCUBE event livestream Don’t miss theCUBE’s coverage of MWC25 Barcelona event March 3-6.
