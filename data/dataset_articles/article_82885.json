  "text": "Seismic has announced its Winter 2025 Product Release, introducing new AI-assisted solutions to support revenue leaders and their teams in enhancing efficiency and alignment across go-to-market (GTM) operations.\nThe Winter 2025 Release includes features such as \"Aura Copilot,\" which now integrates with Slack and Microsoft Teams to deliver real-time responses within these platforms. This service aims to streamline customer engagement processes by enabling representatives to access information more efficiently.\nFlexible page layouts have been introduced to enhance content accessibility for sellers, allowing marketing and enablement teams to design pages that better organise information. This is intended to aid sellers in locating necessary resources swiftly, and teams can now use Aura Copilot to accelerate page creation in multiple languages.\nEnhancements to Seismic Programs have been made with the introduction of advanced analytics and programme management tools. These updates aim to offer deeper insights into the impact of enablement initiatives, showcasing clearer rep behaviour and programme effectiveness.\nSeismic for Meetings includes AI-powered features to expedite deal cycles by providing intelligent meeting summaries and key takeaways, facilitating the review of calls and identification of subsequent steps.\nLastly, enhancements to Seismic Skills introduce more intuitive dashboards and expanded assessment options. These improvements are designed to provide better visibility into individual rep progress, contributing to more effective skill development and coaching programs.\nAlex Josephs, Director of Sales Enablement Experience at IBM, spoke on the impact of Seismic Pages on their enablement strategy. Josephs said, \"At IBM, we rely on Seismic Pages as the foundation of our enablement strategy, ensuring sellers and business partners have access to consistent, easily navigable sales kits. These kits form the backbone of our Seismic implementation, with a handful of active sales plays guiding our most strategic go-to-market initiatives. These plays, built entirely on Pages, are easily accessible and help align sellers on high-priority products and campaigns. All of it is built on Pages, and it's core to what we do with Seismic.\"\nIn a recent report by Seismic, it was revealed that 95% of GTM leaders experienced improved efficiency, alongside 90% reporting faster time to market and 88% acknowledging optimised operations after integrating AI-powered tools into their processes.\nChief Product Officer at Seismic, Krish Mantripragada, stated, \"Effective enablement is about connecting strategy to execution – but it shouldn't stop there. Revenue leaders must also clearly articulate enablement ROI and be able to scale top behaviours and content across teams and business units. The Seismic Enablement Cloud is the only all-in-one enablement platform for revenue teams to align GTM priorities, centralise insights, and gain full visibility into how enablement programmes impact business outcomes.\"\nThe Winter 2025 Release by Seismic follows the company's recognition in G2's 2025 list of Best Sales Software. Additionally, Seismic recently announced the return of its Seismic City Tours, a series of industry events open to the global enablement community, including its customers and partners, taking place in cities such as London, New York City, and Sydney.",
