  "text": "UND symposium on AI and humanities set for Friday\nThe AI and Human Innovation Showcase will feature presentations from humanities faculty and staff on how they're incorporating artificial intelligence into their work.\nGRAND FORKS – UND will host an all-day symposium Friday examining the intersection of the humanities and artificial intelligence.\nThe AI and Human Innovation Showcase is set to bring together students, faculty and staff to discuss advancements in artificial intelligence and explore its use across the humanities.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“The hope of the showcase is to provide a platform to say what's happening in the world of AI,” read a statement attributed to Emily Cherry Oliver, a theater arts professor and co-director of UND’s AI and Human Development Initiative. “If you’re terrified of AI, that’s totally fine. But maybe you can come, listen to the ways that people are using it and say, ‘Oh, this isn’t so scary.’”\nSarah Newman, director of Art and Education at Harvard’s metaLAB, will deliver a virtual keynote address at the start of the morning session.\nThat will be followed by a panel of UND students and staff including Shelbie Wittie, dean of the College of Education and Human Development to respond to Newman’s presentation and discuss their own work.\nThe afternoon will see 25 “lightning round” presentations from humanities students and faculty showing how they’re incorporating AI into their work.\nThe AI and Human Innovation Showcase will take place from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 28, at the Henry Ballroom in UND’s Memorial Union.\nADVERTISEMENT",
