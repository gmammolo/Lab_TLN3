The Project would be constructed on land already zoned for heavy industrial use and strategically located near transmission lines, utility infrastructure, carbon sequestration, and fiber in Alberta's Industrial Heartland.\nThe GLEC is managed by Kineticor, which successfully developed, constructed, and currently operates the 900 MW Cascade Power Plant near Edson, Alberta.\n\"We are excited to be partnering with Kineticor and for the opportunity to further extend our value chain to provide power to a promising new Alberta-based data centre industry,\" said Stu Taylor, Pembina's Senior Vice President & Corporate Development Officer. \"In addition to our direct investment in Greenlight, Pembina is well positioned to leverage its existing and future asset base to further support the project. The proximity of our Alliance Pipeline offers a potential opportunity to provide natural gas supply to the GLEC, and the potential future development of the Alberta Carbon Grid may provide a future emissions reduction solution.\"\n\"We are thrilled to partner with Pembina on this transformative project,\" said Andrew Plaunt, CEO of Kineticor. \"Alberta's Industrial Heartland is one of the best locations in the province to facilitate a project of this magnitude given the large land base, robust grid infrastructure, and potential for decarbonization solutions over time. By partnering with Pembina, we can leverage and combine our individual strengths and experience in major infrastructure projects to bring all the pieces together to develop a world class facility.\"\nPower Generation to Support Alberta's Growing Data Centre Demand\nThe GLEC is one of the largest and most advanced baseload power developments in Alberta. Designed to meet the increasing electricity needs driven by the province's growing data centre industry, the facility will be developed in modular phases of approximately 450 MW each to scale with market demand, up to a maximum initial nameplate design of 1,800 MW. The power generation facility is currently in Stage 3 of the Alberta Electric System Operator (\"AESO\") interconnection process, and is progressing through permitting, design, and contracting. GLEC has the optionality to supply power to a co-located data centre or feed directly into Alberta's power grid to support data centre loads across the province.\nData Centre Development and Power Offtake Agreements\nGreenlight is well progressed on an 1,800 MW load application with the AESO on the lands surrounding the GLEC and is targeting grid interconnection in early 2027. Greenlight is actively engaging with numerous customers regarding locating their data centres on GLEC lands and/or procuring long-term power offtake from the Project. GLEC offers prospective customers speed to market and ample ability to scale their growth with reliable and cost-effective power supply. Located near Edmonton, AB which has a highly skilled local labour force, GLEC is an ideal site to execute a project of this scale, all while driving investment and innovation in Alberta.\nSupporting Alberta's Vision for a Thriving Data Centre Industry\nThe Government of Alberta has set an ambitious target of attracting $100 billion in data centre investments by 2030, encouraging developers to \"bring their own power.\" Pembina and Kineticor are committed to supporting this vision by delivering reliable and cost-effective power solutions at scale to data centres looking to locate in the province.\nAbout Kineticor Asset ManagementKineticor Asset Management is a leading developer, manager, and operator of power generation facilities within Alberta.
