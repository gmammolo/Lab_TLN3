  "text": "Scientists at the Crops Research Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR-CRI) and Arima Farms Ghana, a leading agricultural company, have launched the Ghana Wheat Initiative aimed at promoting domestic wheat production.\nThe initiative was launched at a field day event at the Fumesua campus of the CSIR-CRI, where 326 wheat germplasm – a collection of wheat plants that includes wild relatives used to improve wheat varieties – were showcased.\nThe initiative introduces Wheat Pride 999, developed by Greenpride (India), alongside other varieties, carefully selected for heat and drought tolerance, zinc, iron and protein biofortified, high yields and climate resilience.\nThese varieties have undergone rigorous testing across six regions and agro-ecological zones of Ghana and have shown promising results.\nThe initiative seeks to reduce imports of the grain and create economic opportunities for farmers.\nSpeaking at the launch, Managing Director of Arima Farms Ghana, Saalai Manikam, emphasised the initiative would accelerate the country’s efforts towards self-sufficiency and improve food security and nutrition in Ghana.\n“Today, we take a bold step toward Ghana’s food security with the launch of the Ghana Wheat Initiative. This project is a call to action, and we invite all stakeholders to join us in achieving wheat self-sufficiency and empowering our farmers,” she said.\nAccording to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) report, Ghana imports wheat annually from Canada ($147 million), Russia ($58.2 million), Lithuania ($14.6 million), France ($10.5 million), and Ukraine ($10.1 million).\nThe wheat import market continues to grow rapidly for Ghana, with a population growth of over 30 million people coupled with fast urbanisation.\nUnfortunately, the Russia-Ukraine war and the cessation of the black sea grain deal have negatively hindered wheat grain exports from these parts of the world.\nThe initiative will create economic opportunities for farmers, rural communities and processors and enhance the competitiveness of Ghana’s wheat sector.\nThe project received partnerships from the Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, the Indian High Commission, Ghana, the West and Central Africa Wheat Network (WECAWHEAT), the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana, and the Catholic Relief Services (CRS).",
