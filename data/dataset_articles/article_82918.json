  "text": "2 025 is set to be a year jam-packed with exceptional games to play on PC, and whether your setup is bang up to date or not there’ll be something on this list to pique your interest. From frenetic first-person shooters and story-driven RPGs, to action-adventures and co-operative roguelikes, this rundown provides a slice of the best that’s to come.\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows\nFinally capitalising on the appetite for games set in feudal Japan, the latest Assassin’s Creed whisks players back to 16 th century Iga province plus Kyoto, Kobe, and Osaka. In Shadows , you’ll be switching your time between night-loving shinobi Naoe and brute force swordsman Yasuke, the real-life first non-Japanese samurai. A brutal civil war’s culminating phase leaves chaos reigning over the land, yet our two protagonists share common destinies as a new era ushers in.\nMonster Hunter Wilds\nThe thrill of tracking humungous beasts returns in open-world Monster Hunter Wilds , the latest entry in one of gaming’s most glowing genres. In what is sure to be the most visually impressive Monster Hunter yet, relentless storms and dynamic weather shape a dangerous environment; you and your squad of up to three will need to harness all your skills and determination if you’re to successfully slice the game’s freshest creatures into monster meat.\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater\nWith a leaked release date pin-pointing August 28 th as Snake’s return to Soviet-era swampland, summer can’t come soon enough. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater maintains the original’s narrative paranoia but revamps gameplay via fine-tuning movement and aiming, with quality-of-life improvements in the shape of Snake’s newfound ability to crouch walk ensuring this remake is more than just a healthy dose of hi-res re-decoration.\nDOOM: The Dark Ages\nWhat a way to make DOOM even more heavy metal than to whisk us back to blood-stained medieval hell, witnessing the Doom Slayer’s rage first-hand in this prequel to 2016’s reboot. Watch as he rips and tears through gothic imps and armour-clad cacodemons with guitar shredding ferocity, his shield-come-chainsaw a brutal new addition to an arsenal which, gracefully, eschews primitive weaponry in favour of devastating body mulchers like the Super Shotgun.\nStellar Blade\nCapitalising on Steam’s growing share of the AAA market and buoyed by excellent sales for fellow Asian action-adventure Black Myth: Wukong , Stellar Blade developer Shift Up have confirmed the PS5-exclusive is coming to PC in 2025. Delivering stylish hack-and-slash alongside awesome world design, the Korean effort was a throwback to games like Metal Gear Rising . Still, if you love Sekiro’s dodge-parry swordplay but wish it were more accessible then look no further than Stellar Blade .\nThe Outer Worlds 2\nMore of the same isn’t always a bad thing. Take The Outer Worlds 2 , the follow-up to the 2019 sci-fi RPG outlier. Here, instead of reinventing the wheel, we’ll be treated to new frontiers, deeper options for character customisation, more complex NPC and companions, and a heavy narrative whereby meaningful choices determine the fate of the galaxy, more of the same but more expertly presented.\nNinja Gaiden 4\nThe hack-and-slash trailblazer returns in 2025 with trademark intense yet surgically precise combat demanding skill and strategy to execute. A visually stunning cyberpunk-esque backdrop brings Ninja Gaiden 4 bang up to date too, a vibrant playground for young protégé – and newcomer to the series – Yakumo to revel within. Team Ninja aren’t forgetting the series’ legacy though. Series mainstay Ryu Hayabusa returns, and the pair will embark on a voyage to rid a near-future Tokyo of an ancient curse.\nMafia: The Old Country\nServing as both a mob drama reboot and gritty origin story, Mafia: The Old Country focuses on organised crime’s early days in 1900s Sicily, a countryside of rugged beauty which contrasts with grime-ridden cities, where expertise with stiletto blades is integral to surviving an unforgiving criminal underworld. Swearing allegiance to the Torrisi family, players assume command of antihero Enzo Favara in what Hangar 13 assure us is a period-correct mobster movie-alike, with its eye for authenticity extending beyond handgun detail to including localised Sicilian voice acting.\nDying Light: The Beast\nTransporting you to crystalline country resort Castor Woods in a standalone adventure set a decade plus after events of prior mainline titles, Dying Light: The Beast joins up with Kyle Crane – hero of the first game – after he’s escaped from years of inhumane imprisonment and experimentation. With a score to settle against his captors, Crane finds himself imbued with zombie DNA granting him beast-like power to rip unholy retribution whilst piecing together the vestiges of society.\nElden Ring Nightreign\nFromSoftware assure us they’re not following trends with the upcoming co-operative roguelike spin-off of their genre-defying open-world epic Elden Ring . Elden Ring Nightreign tasks a trio of intrepid explorers with surviving a three day-and-night cycle in the unbridled Limveld, a locale steeped in tough as nails creatures, complex lore, and relics, collecting the latter of which enhancing character skills that can be carried over to subsequent runs.\nCrimson Desert\nOpen world ARPG Crimson Desert has suffered a handful of delays during production, but with all signs pointing to a 2025 release the time is nearly upon us to step into the wonderous continent Pywel and discover if studio Pearl Abyss have managed to seamlessly blend their influence of fifteen different RPGs into one coherent whole. Indeed, Crimson Desert has playfully been dubbed ‘ Assassin’s Fantasy 15: Elder Witcher’s Scrolls of Tsushima’, which at the very least supports the game’s claim of multiple regions, each possessing unique cultures and traditions.\nChernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone\nMuch like The Outer Worlds 2 , survival horror sequel Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone expands on much which many enjoyed in the first game. Promised here is deeper non-linear storytelling, a broader, more interest cast of characters, harsher combat, and – new to the sequel – a vast open world Zone, a place so uncannily alike to the real-life Chornobyl exclusion zone, replete with all manner of physics-bending anomaly to harness or side-step depending on how daring you feel.\nThe Last of Us Part II Remastered\nCoinciding with the TV release of The Last of Us season 2 we have The Last of Us Part II Remastered , a decidedly more brutal depiction of post-apocalyptic America following 2013’s cordyceps outbreak. Ellie’s a little older, she’s fuelled with rage, and hellbent on seeing her revenge mission following a tragic event through to completion no matter the cost. Excellent new characters and a deeply immersive Seattle as backdrop elevate The Last of Us Part II to one of the greatest gaming sequels ever.\nThe First Berserker: Khazan\nHardcore action RPG The First Berserker: Khazan, based on the Dungeon Fighter Online universe, is an origin story focusing on the The First Berzerker named, you guessed it, Khazan set 800 years before DnF. The intricate, engaging combat melding with strategic, hard-won battling looks supreme, but perhaps most eye-catching is the game’s comic book aesthetic which brings a unique feel to the well-trodden fayre of slicing and dicing.\nKilling Floor 3\nIn Killing Floor 3 , you – either on your own or in a squad of up to six players – partake in a last-ditch resistance to save the future of humanity from hordes of bioengineered monsters released by an evil megacorporation. Supporting the frenzied horror action is the chance to earn dosh, unlock skills, and access an awesome arsenal of weaponry which – including shotguns, flamethrowers, and katanas – can be customised via hundreds of mods and gadgets.",
