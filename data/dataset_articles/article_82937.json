  "text": "Mr. Steve Harpur reports\nPROGRESSIVE PLANET KICKS OFF PLANT MODERNIZATION WITH ROBOTICS INVESTMENT\nProgressive Planet Solutions Inc. has commenced its investments in robotics as part of a systematic, phased approach to modernizing its plant operations.\nProgressive Planet recently completed a planned shutdown of its plant to upgrade its legacy PLC system with a modern one. This upgrade laid the foundation for further investments in robotics and automation.\nThe first phase of plant upgrades has commenced with an estimated final cost of less than $500,000. The new robotics system, expected to be delivered in September, 2025, will be integrated into Progressive Planet's two largest production lines.\n\"We are advancing automation and maximizing efficiency,\" shared Andrew Towsley, vice-president of operations. \"This upgrade is a huge step in modernizing our packaging operations. By replacing our 17-year-old legacy system with new state-of-the-art robotics, we are increasing throughput and eliminating more manual palletization. The new system enables us to run both our animal care product line and our powder product line simultaneously, significantly improving efficiency. This advancement streamlines workflow, optimizes packaging speed, and allows us to robotically palletize more products with greater precision and reliability.\"\n\"This marks a significant milestone in our commitment to modernizing operations and increase efficiency,\" said Steve Harpur, Progressive Planet chief executive officer. \"With this investment in robotics, we are not just upgrading equipment -- we are positioning Progressive Planet for long-term growth and enhanced productivity.\"\nProgressive Planet remains committed to continuously improving its operations to remain competitive by investing in best available technologies.\nAbout Progressive Planet Solutions Inc.\nProgressive Planet, based in Kamloops, B.C., is redefining sustainability with its products for a healthy planet.
