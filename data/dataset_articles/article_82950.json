  "text": "Chevy S10 SS was already equipped with a 5.3L LS V8, but it’s got quite a bit more punch now thanks to this fresh swap. As many Bow Tie fans undoubtedly remember , GM offered a performance-focused version of its compact pickup – dubbed the Chevy S10 SS – from 1994-1998, though only a few thousand were built in each of those model years. The Chevy S10 SS got the 4.3-liter Vortec V6 as standard – making between 180-200 horsepower depending on the year – along with a two-inch lowered suspension, unique bodywork, and the ZQ8 Sport Suspension package. However, the folks behind the YouTube channel Bluu Racing recently opted to give their S10 SS a bit more in terms of motivation.\nIn this 12-ish minute long video, we get to see those folks swap a 6.0-liter LS V8 into their Chevy S10 SS, in fact, right after the donor block was cleaned up by a local machine shop. The block also got new cam bearings, along with a crank from a 5.3-liter powerplant.\nThe pistons and bearings go in next, after which it’s time to get this mill installed in its new home. This is a pretty easy process, but our host notes that you’ll want to be careful not to hit the crossmember if it isn’t notched, and in this case, not having the heads and headers in installed beforehand makes the process easier.\nDespite this, the oil pan doesn’t have a ton of clearance, but if it fits, its ships, as they say. With the heads on, we can see there’s a clearance issue with the valve covers and coil pack, however. Next up is the fueling system, which our host runs new lines for, after which he installs the new Holley EFI setup on top, as well as the headers. After all of this is complete, it’s time to test fire the new engine, and it starts right up with no hesitation.\nNow, it’s time to button everything up by installing a new driveshaft, and take the thing for a test drive – which reveals that the brakes on this Chevy S10 SS aren’t exactly ready to handle all the newfound power it has.\nRegardless, this compact pickup is now much gnarlier than even before – it already had a 5.3 swap prior to this change – but the owner has plumbed in a shot of nitrous as well, just in case he needs it. All of this work ultimately pays off at the end of the clip, as we get to see this pickup run an impressive 11.39-second quarter-mile at 118 mph – not too shabby, we’d say.\nJoin the Chevrolet Forums now!",
