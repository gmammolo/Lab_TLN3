  "text": "Reports Q4 revenue $4M, consensus $3.95M. “Our customers have made important progress in validating the differentiated value of deep, unbiased proteomics at scale throughout the year, and I’m thrilled that the momentum is growing despite the challenging macroeconomic environment” said Omid Farokhzad, chair and CEO of Seer (SEER). “We saw a surge in customer publications, strong demand for STAC, and we expanded upon our partnership with Thermo Fisher Scientific to accelerate adoption of our Proteograph Product Suite. I believe we are well-positioned for a stronger year in 2025 and my confidence in our platform, our value proposition, and the immense opportunity ahead has never been greater.”\nPublished first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
