  "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Lithium Corp. (\"American Lithium” or the \"Company”) (TSX-V:LI | OTCQX:AMLIF | Frankfurt:5LA1) is pleased to announce an updated Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE”) for the Tonopah Lithium Claims (\"TLC”) project, located in the Esmerelda lithium district northwest of Tonopah, Nevada. The updated MRE has successfully converted Indicated Resources to the Measured category, increasing Measured Resources 47% from the previous 2023 MRE at TLC. The resource block model has been further refined, increasing the confidence of the TLC resource. The vast majority of resources used in the 2024 PEA Mine Plan are now within the more reliable Measured Resource footprint.\nThe updated MRE was completed by Stantec Consulting Services Inc. of Salt Lake City, UT and is based on an additional 44 drill holes drilled since the previously filed January 2023 MRE.\nHighlights : (see Table 1 February 2025 TLC MRE & Table 2 Previous January 2023 TLC MRE, below)\nLink to: Figure 1 - TLC Project Updated Mineral Resource Block Outline and Drill Hole Location Map (also see below)\nMeasured Resource - 6.17 Mt Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (\"LCE”) (1,365 Mt @ 849 ppm Li); increase of 47% contained LCE versus 2023 MRE Indicated Resource - 2.39 Mt LCE (553 Mt @ 808 ppm Li); decrease of 48% versus 2023 MRE Measured + Indicated Resource - 8.56 Mt LCE (1,918 Mt @ 839 ppm Li); 3% decrease from 2023 MRE Inferred Resource - 1.44 Mt LCE (345 Mt @ 780 ppm Li); 22% decrease from 2023 MRE American Lithium Interim CEO, Alex Tsakumis states : \"We are very pleased with the newly established and upgraded Measured Resource footprint at TLC as it not only increases the resource confidence level in the Measured category but also represents the core of the 2024 PEA Mine Plan. Our focus remains on diligently and prudently advancing our projects as we prepare for an anticipated recovery in the battery metals market.”",
