  "text": "OpenAI is launching GPT-4.5 today, its newest and largest AI language model. GPT-4.5 will be available as a research preview for ChatGPT Pro users to start. OpenAI is calling the release its “most knowledgable model yet.” but its not a frontier model and might not perform as well as o1 or o3-mini, The Verge reported.\nGPT-4.5 will have better writing capabilities, improved world knowledge, and what OpenAI calls a “refined personality over previous models.” OpenAI says interacting with GPT 4.5 will feel more “natural,” adding that the model is better at recognizing patterns and drawing connections, making it ideal for writing, programming, and “solving practical problems.”\nHowever, OpenAI notes that it won’t introduce enough new capabilities to be considered a frontier model. “GPT-4.5 is not a frontier model, but it is OpenAI’s largest LLM, improving on GPT-4’s computational efficiency by more than 10x,” OpenAI says in a document that leaked ahead of its announcement.\n“It does not introduce 7 net-new frontier capabilities compared to previous reasoning releases and its performance is below that of o1, o3-mini, and deep research on most preparedness evaluations.”\nCNBC reported: OpenAI on Thursday announced the research preview of GPT-4.5, a general-purpose large language model. It will initially be open to software developers and people with ChatGPT Pro subscriptions.\nThe model presents inaccurate information less frequently than predecessors, OpenAI said in a blog post.\n“Early testing shows that interacting with GPT-4.5 feels more natural. Its broader knowledge base, improved ability to follow user intent, and greater ‘EQ’ make it useful for tasks like improving writing, programming and solving practical problems,” OpenAI wrote. GPT-4.5 demonstrated a lower hallucination rate than OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o1 models in one test, the company said in a report accompanying Thursday’s release.\nThe release nevertheless represents progress for one of the most highly prized startups in the world. Last month CNBC reported that OpenAI was in discussions on a $40 billion funding round at $350 billion valuation.\nVentureBeat reported: It’s here: OpenAI has announced the release of GBT-4.5, a research preview of its latest and most powerful language model (LLM) for chat applications — yet pointedly, the company says specifically in the model’s system card (a report outlining its capabilities, which leaked early online.)\n“GPT-4.5 is not a frontier model, but it is OpenAI’s largest LLM, improving in GPT-4’s computational efficiency by more than 10x”\nIt’s also not a “reasoning model,” the new class of models offered by OpenAI, DeepSeek, Anthropic, and many others that produce “chains-of-thought,” or stream-of-consciousness like text block in which they reflect on their own assumptions and conclusions to try and catch errors before serving up responses /outputs to users. It’s still more of a classical LLM.",
