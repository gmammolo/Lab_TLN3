  "text": "Researchers have trained an AI framework to read chest X-rays by mimicking the eye movements of radiologists, according to a paper published Dec. 12 in Artificial Intelligence in Medicine.\nThe framework is called ItpCtrl-AI, which stands for interpretable and controllable artificial intelligence, and is \"transparent and highly accurate,\" according to a Feb. 25 news release from Fayetteville-based University of Arkansas.\nA heat map was created from recordings of radiologists' eye movements as they reviewed chest X-rays. The heat map was then used to teach the AI tool where to search for abnormalities, the release said.\nThe researchers are now working with Houston-based University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to train ItpCtrl-AI on CT scan interpretation.\nRead the full study here.",
