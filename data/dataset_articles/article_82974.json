  "text": "Photon-counting detectors developed by University of Houston researchers may lead to more advanced medical imaging diagnostics, according to a study published Dec. 30 in the Journal of Medical Imaging.\nThe technology, which is still in the research and development phase, allows for \"for more precise 3D visualization of different tissues and contrast agents by capturing X-rays at multiple energy levels simultaneously,\" according to a Feb. 25 news release from the university.\n\"This could improve cancer detection,\" study author Mini Das, PhD, a professor at the University of Houston, said in the release. \"If you inject two different contrast agents — one targeting a tumor and another targeting inflammation — you could see where each one accumulates.\"\nRead the full study here.",
