  "text": "Read Previous Post\nWaverly Students Reach for the Stars in Balloon Drop Challenge\nGalactic Night Owls and Gold Mind classes at The Waverly School furthered their astronomy studies by participating in one of the year’s most exciting events. Students worked in teams to design and construct “space vehicles” capable of safely transporting a water balloon when dropped from the Elementary School balcony. The challenge encouraged collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving as students aimed to protect their balloon during the descent. Reflecting on the experience, one student shared, “The balloon drop was a fun opportunity to make friends and socialize with people you had never talked to before.”\nThe Waverly School, 67 W. Bellevue Drive, Pasadena, (626) 792-5940 or visit thewaverlyschool.org.",
