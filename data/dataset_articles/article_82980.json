  "text": "Extreme Networks has announced the upcoming general availability of Extreme Platform ONE for MSPs.\nBuilt on an AI-driven multi-tenant architecture, consumption-based billing and poolable licensing, Extreme Platform ONE aims to enable MSPs to manage customers at scale.\nExtreme Platform ONE helps MSPs manage licenses, performance, and service interruptions within a single workspace, reducing the time and IT staff needed. Leveraging Extreme Platform ONE’s AI Core, MSPs can tap into deep automation powered by conversational, interactive, and autonomous AI agents.\nWith a consumption-based billing model, Extreme also aims to helps eliminate upfront costs and ensures cost predictability, with poolable licensing allowing MSPs to dynamically allocate and reassign licenses across devices, locations, or customers.\nExtreme currently has more than 40 MSP partners.\nExtreme Networks chief product and technology officer Nabil Bukhari said the consumption license grants full control over distribution, activation, and management.\n“Platform ONE boosts productivity by unifying everything into a single collaborative workspace. This streamlined approach empowers MSPs to drive efficiency and growth with greater speed and simplicity,” he said.",
