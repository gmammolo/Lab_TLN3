  "text": "Adelaide-based telecommunications provider Myriota has expanded its connectivity portfolio with the launch of Myriota HyperPulse, a 3GPP 5G-based Narrowband Non-Terrestrial Network (NB-NTN) service.\nThe solution was built in partnership with satellite infrastructure company Viasat and is the first of its kind to be powered by Viasat’s leasing capability, which allows partners like Myriota to scale their satellite connectivity footprint up or down depending on demand.\nIt is intended that Myriota HyperPulse customers will benefit from Viasat’s geostationary L-band network and 3GPP-compliant spectrum, along with Myriota’s hybrid network management platform and power optimised LPWA (low power, wide area) satellite connectivity technology.\nBuilding on Myriota’s commercially available UltraLite service, Myriota HyperPulse expands the solution base to deliver connectivity designed for sensing, tracking, and remote management applications, with combined standards compatibility, battery-only energy efficiency and regular, near-real time reporting.\nMyriota’s Early Adopter Program (EAP) is now open, and the company is accepting applications for the first cohort of development partners to access the Myriota HyperPulse service from April 2025.\nMyriota CEO Ben Cade said the global market for satellite-based communications networks is constantly advancing through technical breakthroughs and network expansions.\n“Building on more than a decade of experience in delivering highly secure and power efficient direct-to-satellite solutions, Myriota HyperPulse, in partnership with Viasat, reinforces how leaders in respective fields can collaborate to support our customers as they apply our unique sensor-based connectivity with their deep customer understanding to deliver disruptive, new approaches to solve crucial problems,” he said.\nIn December 2024, Myriota announced a $50 million funding round to fund expansion of its Adelaide workforce and enhance its Internet of Things connectivity platform and infrastructure.",
