  "text": "Bessent: the deal between the USA and Ukraine on rare earth metals is ready\nThe US-Ukraine deal on rare earth metals is ready, negotiations on it are no longer underway, said the head of the US Treasury, Scott Bessent.\nThe US Treasury Secretary noted that all the formulations have already been fixed.\n\"All that's left are the signatures of President Trump and.. Zelensky,\" Fox News journalist Edward Lawrence wrote on the social network.\nThe White House previously stated that the United States expects to receive $20 billion from the metals deal with Ukraine.\nMeanwhile, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, in an interview with American blogger Mario Naufalu, noted that Russia may be alarmed by the deal between Ukraine and the United States on metals.",
