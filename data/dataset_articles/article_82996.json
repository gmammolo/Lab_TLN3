  "text": "News Article\nFebruary 27, 2025 Study Finds Radon Exposure Increases Odds of Gestational Diabetes Key Takeaways Higher radon exposure is linked to increased gestational diabetes risk in nulliparous pregnant individuals, with a 37% increase in odds at levels ≥2 pCi/L. The study examined interactions between radon, smoking, and PM2.5, finding increased GD odds in high-radon and high-PM2.5 or smoking environments. Radon exposure may induce oxidative stress, inflammation, and placental damage, contributing to gestational diabetes development. Further research is needed to confirm findings and assess individual-level residential radon exposure impacts on gestational diabetes risk. SHOW MORE Radon exposure during pregnancy was significantly linked to increased odds of gestational diabetes.\nNew study findings published in JAMA Network Open announced that higher radon exposure is linked with greater odds of developing gestational diabetes (GD) among nulliparous pregnant individuals, emphasizing the importance and awareness needed around environmental risk factors in maternal health strategies. 1,2\nImage credit: tonefotografia | stock.adobe.com\n“Our primary objective was to examine the association between county-level radon exposure and the risk of GD in a large, racially and ethnically diverse sample of pregnant individuals in the US. We also explored the interactions of radon exposure with smoking and PM 2.5 given the potential shared pathways related to the development of GD,” the study authors said in a news release. 1\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, GD impacts approximately 10% of pregnancies annually in the US. 1 Similar to other types of diabetes, GD affects how the cells use glucose, causing high blood sugar that affects the health of the pregnancy and offspring. While symptoms of GD often go unnoticed, they can present as increased thirst and more frequent urination. 2 GD could also increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease among mothers and increase the risk of childhood obesity. 1\nEnvironmental influences like fine particle matter air pollutants (PM 2.5 ) and smoking have been greatly recognized and connected with GD risk, suggesting a potential link between radon and GD; however, evidence involving radon exposure to GD is limited. The radioactive gas seeps into homes and is known to cause lung cancer, emphasizing the need to establish other potential health risks it can trigger. 1\nThe researchers conducted a multicenter, population-based cohort study using data from the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b) cohort, which included nulliparous pregnant participants from 8 US clinical centers between October 2010 and September 2013. A total of 9107 individuals were included and analyzed from September 2023 to January 2024. Among the 9107 individuals, 3782 individuals never used tobacco. 1\nThe study authors noted that Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory compiled county-level radon data from the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) home assessments, categorizing exposure into 3 levels: under 1, 1 to under 2, and 2 or more picocuries (pCi/L). To investigate potential shared biological pathways, the study further categorized participants by combined radon and smoking status, as well as combined radon and PM 2.5 levels. 1\nClinical diagnosis of GD was measured based on the glucose tolerance test (GTT) and information from medical record abstraction. Additionally, various logistic regression models were used to evaluate the connection between radon exposure and GD. 1\nThe results demonstrated that among nulliparous pregnant individuals, the average county-level radon concentration was 1.6 pCi/L, with 4.2% experiencing GD. After adjustments, individuals in counties with radon levels of 2 pCi/L or higher showed 37% increased odds of GD (OR 1.37, CI 1.02-1.84), which remained similar after accounting for PM 2.5 (OR 1.36, CI 1.00-1.86). 1\nFurther results demonstrated that ever smokers in high-radon counties had 209% increased odds of GD (OR 2.09, CI 1.41-3.11), and those in high-radon and high-PM 2.5 counties had 193% increased odds (OR 1.93, CI 1.31-2.83), although interactions between these factors were not statistically significant. 1\nThe findings suggest a significant link between county-level radon exposure during pregnancy and increased odds of GD, especially when combined with high PM 2.5 levels or smoking. The results highlighted radon’s ability to induce oxidative stress, inflammation, and potential placental damage as contributing factors to GD. However, the study authors noted that further research is needed to confirm the findings and assess individual-level residential radon exposure. 1\nREFERENCES 1.
