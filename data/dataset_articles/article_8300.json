According to the Kentucky Guard, the two are being honored for \"gallantry while conducting lifesaving rescue operations under perilous, life-threatening conditions.\"\nDuring the missions, 241 personnel were rescued, 47 of which were hoist missions like those conducted by Lowe and Hunter’s crew.\nCovering Kentucky\nUrban County Council approves grant funds for social services agencies Erin Rosas 4:49 PM, Jun 21, 2024\nBoth guardsmen told LEX 18 that the conditions in eastern Kentucky were unlike anything they've experienced before.\n\"I have been in three different combat zones, responded to multiple natural disasters - hurricanes, floods, tornadoes - and that was the worst devastation,\" said Lowe.\n“The only comparison I have to that is going after Hurricane Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico.
