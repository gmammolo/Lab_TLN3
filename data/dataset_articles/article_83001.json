  "text": "In the groundbreaking production Out of This World by Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey®, CAST Group’s innovative BlackTrax real-time tracking system played a pivotal role in revolutionizing live entertainment. With a cast of 100 circus performers, many wore special BlackTrax beacons that allowed our cutting-edge technology to track their movements with absolute precision. This enabled programmable spotlights to follow each performer in real time, eliminating human error and illuminating them in a more theatrical, immersive way. By seamlessly integrating with lighting, video, and automation systems, BlackTrax created synchronized effects that responded instantly to the action on stage — setting a new standard for live show production. We’re incredibly proud to have been part of this reimagining of an iconic circus, pushing the boundaries of creativity and innovation.",
