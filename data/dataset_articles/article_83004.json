  "text": "Mazda is no longer just about nimble sports cars and quirky rotary engines. The Japanese automaker has successfully transitioned into the SUV-dominated market, smashing its 1986 U.S. sales record of 379,883 vehicles by an impressive 45,000 units in 2024. With a total of 424,382 cars sold, Mazda’s strategic shift toward premium SUVs and an improved customer experience is paying off in a big way.\nSUVs Lead Mazda’s Growth Mazda’s pivot towards SUVs has been a calculated move. Of the 12 models the company sells in the U.S., eight are SUVs, reflecting the overwhelming market demand. Tom Donnelly, CEO of Mazda’s North American operations, recently spoke to U.S. News & World Report about how the company’s marketing efforts and product strategy have fueled this success.\nA key driver of Mazda’s growth is its ability to appeal to different consumer segments within the SUV market. Take the CX-5 and CX-50, for example—both models might seem to target the same segment, but they cater to distinct demographics. “We view the CX-5 as more urban and sophisticated, whereas [the] CX-50—because of the styling, some of the characteristics and whether it’s a Meridian edition—has more of an outdoorsy feel,” Donnelly explained. This diversification allows Mazda to compete with established brands like Subaru while maintaining a more upscale image.\nA Premium Customer Experience But Mazda’s transformation goes beyond just SUVs. Over the past decade, the company has been rolling out its “Retail Evolution” initiative, revamping its dealerships to create a more premium buying experience. The new dealership design features open spaces, extensive glass elements, and a transparent service process. Mechanics now record video inspections of vehicles to explain necessary repairs, reducing customer frustration over unexpected bills. While only 70% of Mazda dealers have adopted these changes, they accounted for 90% of the brand’s total sales in 2023—proving that a better customer experience leads to stronger loyalty and sales.\nThe Risks and Rewards of an Upmarket Move Mazda’s push upmarket is not without its risks. Typically, when a brand aims for a more premium image, it risks losing customers unwilling to pay higher prices. However, a combination of factors—including supply constraints pushing up vehicle prices and a post-pandemic boom in adventure-oriented lifestyles—has helped Mazda make the transition successfully.\nSports Car Heritage Lives On Despite the SUV dominance, Mazda enthusiasts can rest assured that the brand’s sports car heritage is not forgotten. The Mazda3 sedan saw a 40% year-over-year sales increase in a struggling sedan market. Meanwhile, Donnelly reassured fans that the beloved Miata is here to stay. “It’s absolutely a halo vehicle for us that goes beyond sales contributions,” he said, hinting at future plans while referencing the positive reception of the Iconic SP concept car from the 2023 Japan Mobility Show. While he didn’t confirm an electrified Miata, he urged fans to “stay tuned.”\nThe Rotary Engine’s Potential Comeback Perhaps most exciting for longtime Mazda loyalists is the company’s continued investment in the rotary engine. A dedicated engineering team is working on bringing back this iconic technology, potentially in a new sports car. While details remain scarce, Mazda’s commitment to innovation suggests that enthusiasts may have something to look forward to.\nLooking Ahead Mazda’s ability to evolve without completely abandoning its roots is a testament to its strategic vision. By embracing SUVs and refining its customer experience while keeping its sports car legacy alive, Mazda is setting itself up for long-term success. The brand’s record-breaking 2024 sales are just the beginning of a new chapter that promises to blend adventure, sophistication, and driving passion in equal measure.",
