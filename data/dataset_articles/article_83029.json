  "text": "Classified in: Science and technology , Business\nSubject: ERN Nelnet Reports Fourth Quarter 2024 Results\nLINCOLN, Neb. , Feb. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Nelnet (NYSE: NNI) today reported GAAP net income of $63.2 million , or $1.73 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with a GAAP net loss of $7.9 million , or $0.21 per share, for the same period a year ago.\nNet income, excluding derivative market value adjustments 1 , was $52.7 million , or $1.44 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with a net loss of $0.7 million , or $0.02 per share, for the same period in 2023.\n\"We are pleased with the results in the fourth quarter of 2024 and optimistic about the opportunities ahead in 2025,\" said Jeff Noordhoek , chief executive officer of Nelnet. \"This past year was a record-breaking one for Nelnet Business Services, one of our three core businesses. For Nelnet Diversified Services, 2024 was a year of strategic reinvestment as we transitioned to the new federal servicing contract and expanded our private loan servicing portfolio. Nelnet Financial Services focused on consolidation and alignment as part of our strategy to diversify assets and offset earnings from our legacy student loan portfolio. Our results reflect a balanced mix of success across different segments - exactly what we expect from a diversified company.\"\nNelnet has four reportable operating segments, earning interest income on loans in its Asset Generation and Management (AGM) and Nelnet Bank segments, both part of the company's Nelnet Financial Services (NFS) division, and fee-based revenue in its Loan Servicing and Systems (referred to as Nelnet Diversified Services (NDS)) and Education Technology Services and Payments (referred to as Nelnet Business Services (NBS)) segments. Other business activities and operating segments that are not reportable and not part of the NFS division are combined and included in Corporate Activities.\nAsset Generation and Management\nThe AGM operating segment reported loan and investment net interest income of $48.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with $35.6 million for the same period a year ago. The increase in 2024 was due an increase in loan spread 2 , offset by the anticipated runoff of the legacy Federal Family Education Loan Program loan portfolio. The average balance of loans outstanding decreased from $12.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023 to $9.4 billion for the same period in 2024.\nAGM recognized a provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2024 of $13.5 million ( $10.3 million after tax), compared with $0.4 million ( $0.3 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 2023. Provision for loan losses was primarily impacted by establishing an initial allowance for consumer loans acquired during the fourth quarter of 2024. AGM also recognized a non-cash provision expense of $4.6 million ( $3.5 million after tax) during the fourth quarter of 2024 related to the company's ownership of beneficial interest in loan securitizations.\nIn addition, AGM recognized income of $8.3 million ( $6.3 million after tax) related to changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, compared with a loss of $4.9 million ( $3.7 million after tax) for the same period in 2023. AGM recognized net income after tax of $25.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with $17.2 million for the same period in 2023.",
