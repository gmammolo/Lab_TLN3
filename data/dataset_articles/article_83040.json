  "text": "It’s official: AI has transcended hype\nFrom tech trend to essential tool—AI is reshaping industries and the entire communications landscape.\nLast February, we published research analyzing how three technologies—AI, the Metaverse and NFTs—took different paths in public conversation. In their early months, all three rocketed out of the gate… but only AI had staying power.\nOne year later, our team re-ran the numbers and guess what? The AI hype train didn’t just keep going—it firewalled the throttle. Just look above at what happened to the right of the dashed line, which was the graph one year ago!\nThe latest data on Google Search trends shows AI interest has completely eclipsed other major tech buzzwords and the gap has only widened.\nWhy? Because AI isn’t just hype—it’s transforming industries in real-time. Unlike NFTs, which had their speculative boom-and-bust, or the Metaverse, which still struggles to find its mainstream purpose, AI is delivering tangible, world-changing results that transcend not only industry but the gap between B2B and B2C communications.\nConsider:\n- GenAI: Tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney and Claude are reinventing content creation—from writing to art to code.\n- Enterprise Adoption: Businesses are integrating AI to automate workflows, boost productivity and make better decisions.\n- AI in Daily Life: From customer service chatbots to AI-powered search, AI is fast on its way to becoming an everyday utility, not just a novelty.\nThe real question now isn’t whether AI interest will level off before the next time we run the numbers (because it won’t). It’s how much bigger can it get?\nWhat This Means for Communicators\nWe can’t help but apply this AI momentum to the thing we do – help brands and organizations communicate, so here are a few trends we’re following closer to home:\n- Transforming Storytelling: AI is enabling hyper-personalized content (both in creation and delivery) and data-driven messaging, allowing brands to connect with audiences in more meaningful ways.\n- Shaping Media Strategies: AI-powered analytics are refining how communicators measure impact, predict trends and optimize outreach efforts.\n- Enhancing Crisis Communications: With real-time monitoring and sentiment analysis, AI helps communicators anticipate and manage brand reputation more effectively.\n- Redefining Audience Engagement: From AI-generated content to chatbots handling real-time interactions, AI is changing how brands interact with stakeholders.\nFor communication professionals navigating this AI-driven landscape, the data presents a clear directive: AI is no longer optional—it is essential. Here are three ways that communicators can stay ahead:\n- Integrate AI Tools: Leverage AI-driven analytics, sentiment analysis and automation to enhance strategy and execution.\n- Experiment with AI-Generated Content: Test AI-driven copywriting, video generation and personalization to refine messaging and engagement.\n- Invent, then invent again: AI’s evolution is rapid. Communicators must remain agile, continuously learning and experimenting with new capabilities.\nWhile other tech fads come and go, AI will continue to reshape how brands tell their stories, connect with audiences and measure success.\nAI isn’t just a tool for efficiency—it’s a strategic imperative. Communicators who embrace AI today will be the ones shaping the conversations of tomorrow.\n(Rita Herbstman and Maddie Blanz from our TRUE Global Intelligence practice contributed to this article, as did designer Josh Kirk.)",
