  "text": "|\n(last updated 27 Feb 2025)\n> See also Current Issues for\nA study performed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on behalf of the Buenos Aires Province Secretariat of Environmental Policy (SPA) found that the uranium concentration in 10 of 51 samples taken exceeds 20 micrograms per liter, which is the limit established by the Province. The average concentration in those wells was 26 micrograms, reaching almost 35 micrograms per liter in one case. (Clarín Nov. 12, 2005)\n> View details (SPA - in Spanish)\nThe Argentinian nuclear regulatory authority (ARN ) maintains that (a) the uranium detected was natural rather than enriched uranium, (b) the concentrations found are within the range of values naturally found in the area, (c) the Argentinian standard of 100 µg U/L is appropriate for radiation protection - ignoring the fact that the WHO provisional guideline of 15 µg/L was established for the chemical toxicity of uranium.\n> See also Greenpeace Argentina (in Spanish)\nAfter reiterated complaints, the Buenos Aires Province Secretariat of Environmental Policy is planning to investigate if \"genetic mutations\" exist in residents living near the Centro Atómico Ezeiza. (Diario Uno de Mendoza June 26, 2006)\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Authority (ARN), through its director Raúl Racana, maintained that the waters of the Buenos Aires agglomeration neighbouring the Nuclear center of Ezeiza, are not contaminated. He assured that there \"exists total security for the population\" of Ezeiza and the environs.\nThe position of the ARN was set out to Clarín as a result of a special report published Sunday 19 of July, where it was revealed that the investigation on the possible contamination of the Puelche aquifer with uranium takes up to 9 years of delay. According to a report ordered by the judge of the cause, the aquifers would have received uranium residues of the Nuclear center, becoming a serious risk for approximately one million inhabitants of Ezeiza, Esteban Echeverría and La Matanza.\n(Clarín July 30, 2009)\n> View older issues\n|",
