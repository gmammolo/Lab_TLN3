  "text": "You’ve just moved into a new neighborhood. You don’t know much about the area, or\nany of your neighbors. One day, your worst nightmare becomes a reality. You turn around for\njust a second and your child is gone. In your panic you grab your phone, ready to ask your\nneighbors for help. You quickly realize you have no one to call. For Huntington resident Michael Hartofilis, the founder of a new neighborhood app\ncalled Howl, this terrifying situation was his reality. “My daughter ran off. She was lost briefly from our property, and I had no means of\nconnecting with the neighbors on my street when we just moved into our home. I didn&#39;t have\nanyone’s phone number.” This moment made Hartofilis realize that many emergencies need a quicker response, and\nfrom there his idea for Howl was formed. The new product officially launched in the Huntington\ncommunity two weeks ago and has attracted more than 1,000 users. Howl started as a security alert system that allowed users to utilize voice assistants like\nAlexa, Google Home, or Siri to create a specific sound and warn emergency contacts in the case\nof a medical emergency or home invasion. “We wanted to create a way for people to engage with their immediate community,\nwhether it’s for emergencies, lost pets, or even just organizing playdates for kids,” Hartofilis\nsaid. Two years ago, the brand took a pivot and headed in a more user-friendly direction. It\ntook on the look and feel of a social media platform. Hartofilis plans to use Howl to encourage in-\nperson interactions between neighbors. Howl’s user growth reflects the new software’s success. In 2021, Howl had around 4,500\nusers. As it evolved, the app reached 8,000 users before the complete transition. With the change\nin product positioning, the growth is basically starting over again, he said. “We have in our plan is to grow town by town and you know the street by street so when\na user signs up, they see that neighbors on their street neighbors in their town are also on the\nplatform and these are the people that they want to engage.” Howl’s growth is currently attributed to word-of-mouth and localized promotion.\nWith the app still lacking popularity in other places, the Howl team has adopted a\nmarketing strategy that is as localized as possible. If a user downloads the app and finds out their\nneighbors aren’t on the platform, the user experience will greatly diminish. Howl’s most central function is promoting interaction between neighbors. Users can share\ninformation, organize events, and find lost pets on this platform, as well as create a Howl alert\nwhich notifies neighbors on the block and within a one-mile radius. When signing up, to ensure safety, users must provide proof of their address. Howl\nensures that all user interactions are based on real identities to avoid spam.\nHowl plans to roll out a new “Events feature” in two to three weeks. “This event feature where you can schedule a public event and see all the verified\nneighbors interested in joining they can RSVP,” Hartofilis said. The events feature will allow users to create, post, and participate in local events. Users\ncan post event details on the platform so that other neighbors can know more about the event and\nsign up for events directly. The aim of this feature is to help people connect in the real world.\nHowl’s goal is to become a resource for community engagement and local socialization,\nthat neighborhoods can’t live without.
