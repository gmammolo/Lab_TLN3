  "text": "Law360 (subscription) has published an in-depth profile on Lieff Cabraser’s Privacy & Cybersecurity Law practice group as part of its recognition of the firm as a 2024 “Cybersecurity & Privacy Law Practice Group of the Year.” The feature highlights the firm’s leadership in groundbreaking internet privacy and data security litigation, including major settlements with some of the world’s largest tech companies.\nIn one case, Lieff Cabraser secured a $115 million settlement with Oracle, addressing allegations that the company unlawfully collected and sold detailed electronic profiles of internet users without consent. The settlement, which required Oracle to overhaul its data collection practices, set a critical precedent by confirming that the unauthorized collection of personal data can carry significant liability.\nIn another key victory, the firm helped negotiate a $62 million settlement with Google over claims that the tech giant illegally tracked and stored smartphone users’ private location information, even after users disabled the “location history” feature. The deal also required Google to implement significant privacy reforms, including policies to automatically delete location information after 18 months.\n“These settlements are important because they both act as a deterrent and stand as statements that this kind of conduct is actionable,” noted Michael W. Sobol, partner and chair of Lieff Cabraser’s Cybersecurity & Privacy practice group. “We have to get a handle on what’s going on with our data, and private citizens and private attorneys have an important role to play in that.”\nRead the full profile on Law360’s website (subscription).\nAbout Lieff Cabraser\nDescribed by The American Lawyer as “one of the nation’s premier plaintiffs’ firms,” Lieff Cabraser enjoys a national reputation for professional integrity and the successful prosecution of our clients’ claims.
