  "text": "Marvell Technol...on Thu, 02/27/2025 - 14:40\nMarvell has once again been honored with a variety of Lightwave+BTR Innovation Reviews high scores. A panel of experts from the optical communications community recognized five products from Marvell’s portfolio as among the best in the industry.\nMarvell has once again been honored with a variety of Lightwave+BTR Innovation Reviews high scores. A panel of experts from the optical communications community recognized five products from Marvell’s portfolio as among the best in the industry.\n“On behalf of the Lightwave+BTR Innovation Reviews, I would like to congratulate Marvell on again achieving a well-deserved honoree status for multiple products,” said Lightwave+BTR Editor-in-Chief Sean Buckley. “This is a very competitive program allowing us to showcase and applaud the most innovative products that significantly impact the industry. It says a lot that Marvell is consistently recognized by these experts for its innovation.”\nThe reviews gave top scores to:\nMarvell Structera CXL Product Line This product line brings the power of Compute Express Link (CXL®) to the memory bandwidth and capacity challenges faced by today's data center operators. The Structera A family of near-memory accelerators enables optimal compute and memory scaling. It integrates 16 processor cores and is optimized to improve the performance of high memory-bandwidth applications such as DLRM. The Structera X family of memory-expansion controllers maximizes performance and addresses sustainability. It is the first to support up to 12 DDR4 memory modules, enabling module recycling to reduce e-waste and maximize server memory capacity for applications such as in-memory databases.\nSpica Gen2-T 5 nm Transmit-Only 800G PAM4 Optical DSP\nThe industry’s first 5nm 800 Gbps transmit-only PAM4 optical DSP. Designed for transmit retimed optical modules (TRO modules), Spica Gen2-T can reduce the power consumption of 800 Gbps optical modules by more than 40% while maintaining interoperability with conventional optical modules and IEEE 802.3 compliant host devices.\nMarvell Alaska A 1.6T PAM4 DSP for Active Electrical Cables\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning applications are driving greater connectivity bandwidth requirements between AI accelerators, server to top-of-rack links and switch-to-switch interconnects within data center racks. The latest addition to the Alaska A family is built on 5nm process and leverages industry-leading Marvell PAM4 DSP technology to enable short-reach copper interconnect solutions that meet the growing bandwidth requirements of accelerated infrastructure. According to 650 Group,\nthe AEC silicon market is expected to grow at 64% per yearto reach $1 billion by 2028, with DSPs powering AECs to reach nearly 40 million units per year.\nMarvell Nova 2 1.6 Tbps PAM4 Optical DSP The industry’s first 1.6 Tbps PAM4 optical DSP features 200 Gbps electrical and optical interfaces to meet the escalating performance demands of accelerated infrastructure, generative AI, and high-performance computing. These optical DSPs enable module manufacturers to develop a wide range of industry-standard form factor optical modules that deliver 2x more bandwidth than current 800 Gbps optical modules for the transition to 200G interfaces in accelerated infrastructure. Doubling optical module and interface bandwidth greatly increases the amount of network traffic that can be managed within the same physical space, thereby paving a pathway to scale capacity and increase return on infrastructure investments. Integrated laser drivers optimize power dissipation and transmit performance.\nMarvell Alaska P PCIe Retimer Product Line This line of PCIe Gen 6 and CXL 3 retimers is built on a 10-year history of Marvell PAM4 technology leadership. Higher bandwidth and faster data rates limit the physical reach signals can travel reliably, reducing the distance connections can span. These retimers address the problem by compensating for signal degradations and regenerating the signal to deliver reliable communication over the physical distances required for connections between GPUs and CPUs within an AI server, between GPUs on different boards, or between CPUs and a pool of shared memory enabled by CXL, among other use cases.",
