  "text": "Saratoga County psychiatrist stimulating brain to treat depression\nA local psychiatrist is taking a unique approach to treating depression at his Saratoga County practice.\nManuel Astruc, M.D. & Associates provides Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Therapy.\nIt’s a non-invasive treatment option proven to show significant results by directly stimulating deeper and broader areas of the brain, effectively treating depression, and much faster than before, according to the Saratoga County Chamber of Commerce.\n“So people are able to get incredible results for their depression over 5 days, instead of 6 weeks plus,” he said.\nTMS therapy is most effective for medication-resistant patients who experience little to no symptom relief through antidepressants and psychotherapy.\nReducing the total treatment time makes this therapy more affordable and accessible for patients.\n“What’s really exciting about the 5 in 5 program, our five days, five hours a day program is that it’s made this accessible to a much larger group of people,” he said.\nAstruc, who has been practicing in the Saratoga Springs area for more than 20 years, says this transformative therapy has very few side effects.",
