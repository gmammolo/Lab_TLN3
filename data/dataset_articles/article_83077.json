  "text": "Katy Perry performs during the Super Bowl halftime show at University of Phoenix Stadium on Feb. 1, 2015, in Glendale, Ariz. Now she'll be in space but for real this time. Elsa/Getty Images hide caption\ntoggle caption Elsa/Getty Images Have you ever thought to yourself, Man, I wish some notable women in pop culture would go explore space sometime soon ? Well, fear not dear reader, because your dreams are coming true.\nThree things to know: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' space exploration company Blue Origin announced its next human flight for its New Shepard program Thursday. The 11-minute suborbital flight is scheduled for sometime this spring.\nThe crew was selected by Bezos' fiancée and journalist Lauren Sánchez, who will be joined on the spacecraft by Katy Perry, Gayle King and other notable figures: scientist Amanda Nguyen, entrepreneur Aisha Bowe and filmmaker Kerianne Flynn.\nBlue Origin says that this is the 11th human flight for the New Shepard program, and the 31st in its history. This is also the first all-female flight crew since Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova's solo spaceflight in 1963. Sponsor Message",
