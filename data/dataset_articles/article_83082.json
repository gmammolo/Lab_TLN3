  "text": "AMD RX 9070 Series GPU launch imminent: Retailers Prepare with Preliminary Pricing Retailers such as Newegg and MicroCenter are gearing up for the launch of AMD’s RX 9070 series GPUs, which is expected tomorrow.This RDNA 4 GPU launch follows a “discrete” unveiling at CES 2025, where AMD surprised manny by not revealing specific details about the lineup. Now, almost two months later, AMD is slated to showcase the next-generation GPU series in full, prompting retailers to list RDNA 4 GPUs on their platforms, offering a glimpse into potential pricing. The anticipation is building as consumers await official specifications and performance metrics.\nPublished: May 28, 2025\nMicroCenter Lists Preliminary Prices for AMD’s RDNA 4 GPUs MicroCenter has provided early insights into potential pricing by listing several RDNA 4 GPUs. It’s important to note that these retail prices might be placeholder values, at least for some listings. The listings include both RX 9070 XT and non-XT variants from various manufacturers, offering a range of options for consumers.\nImage Credits: Olrak_29 The ASRock Triple fan variant of the Radeon RX 9070 XT is listed as the cheapest, priced at $699. The non-XT counterpart is listed for $649, indicating a slight price difference between the two models. However, one RX 9070 XT listing shows a price of $1,100, which is likely a placeholder value. The variety in pricing suggests different features and performance levels across the board.\nASRock AMD Radeon RX 9070 CL Triple Fan: $649.99 Sapphire Technology AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT PULSE Triple Fan: $899.99 ASRock AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT SL Triple Fan: $699.99 ASUS AMD radeon RX 9070 XT Prime Overclocked Triple Fan: $1,049.99 XFX AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Swift Triple Fan: $729.99 PowerColor AMD Radeon RX 9070 Reaper Triple Fan: $1,099.99 Gigabyte AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Gaming Overclocked Triple Fan: $899.99 PowerColor AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Reaper Triple Fan: $1,100.00 These prices are not yet official, and final details are expected tomorrow when AMD showcases the RDNA 4 lineup. The range in listed prices suggests that manufacturers are positioning their cards differently based on features like cooling and overclocking capabilities. Consumers are advised to await official announcements before making purchasing decisions.\nNewegg Lists RDNA 4 GPUs in Pre-Built Systems Along with MicroCenter, Newegg has also listed the new GPUs, but in pre-built systems from iBUYPOWER and AVGPC. The maximum configuration includes the ryzen 7 9700X and AMD’s flagship RDNA 4 GPU, priced at $1,799. This configuration also includes 32 GB of DDR5 memory and a 1 TB SSD, offering a high-performance package for gamers and content creators.\nEstimates suggest that the flagship model in this pre-built configuration is priced around $650-$700, which seems justified given the overall system specifications. This provides another data point for potential pricing of the standalone GPUs. The inclusion of these GPUs in pre-built systems indicates their readiness for market integration.\nPerformance Expectations and Market positioning The Radeon RX 9070 XT is expected to be a strong competitor in the high-end GPU market.Recent reports indicate that the Radeon RX 9070 XT rivals NVIDIA’s RTX 4080 in Furmark stress tests. Given that the RTX 4080 is available for over $1,000,this positions the RX 9070 XT as a competitive option,especially if the preliminary pricing holds true. This could potentially disrupt the existing market dynamics.\nIt’s important to note that these comparisons are based on synthetic performance benchmarks. Real-world gaming performance and driver optimizations will ultimately determine the RX 9070 XT’s true competitive standing. Gamers should consider waiting for self-reliant reviews and benchmarks before drawing definitive conclusions.\nAnticipation builds for Official Launch The official launch of AMD’s RDNA 4 GPUs is highly anticipated. The company is expected to provide detailed specifications, performance metrics, and official pricing for the entire lineup. The “hype created over the past weeks” suggests that mainstream GPU consumers are in for a treat,with potential for important performance gains and competitive pricing. The launch is poised to be a major event in the GPU market.\nAMD is set to showcase the RDNA 4 lineup tomorrow, and the industry is watching closely to see how Team Red positions its new GPUs against the competition. The preliminary pricing from retailers like MicroCenter and Newegg offers a tantalizing glimpse into what consumers can expect. The coming days will reveal the true potential of the RX 9070 series.\nAMD RX 9070 Series: Is This the GPU to Finally Topple NVIDIA’s Reign?
