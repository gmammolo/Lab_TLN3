Genomic pathway analysis helps identify genetic markers linked to diseases, allowing pharmaceutical companies to develop targeted therapies. Investments in genomics-based solutions drive innovation across pharmaceuticals, agritech, and synthetic biology. Proteomics tools are being deployed to research and analyse biomarkers, understand disease mechanisms, and in bioforensics.\nDeliverables: Products vs. Services The product segment led the U.S. genomics market, with extensive use of instruments and techniques such as polymerase chain reactions (PCR). In 2024, the PCR sector held the largest market share, driven by its decreasing cost and high demand in hospitals, clinics, and ambulatory centers. PCR is used in the lab to create several copies of particular DNA.\nThe services segment is anticipated to grow with the highest CAGR during the studied years. The development of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is enabling companies to outsource projects that require high-throughput and cost-effective sequencing, making large-scale genomic analysis feasible. The cost of sequencing a human genome has dropped substantially, from US$100 million in 2001 to under US$200, making it widely accessible. Lower-cost services have allowed sequencing technologies to be accessible in clinical diagnostics, precision medicine, and consumer genomics. Increasing use of sequencing for cancer genomics, rare disease diagnostics, and pharmacogenomics is driving demand. Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing (WGS/WES) are now more common in hospitals and research institutions.\nEnd-Use: Academic & Government Institutes Dominate The academic & government Institutes segment dominated the market. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other U.S. agencies provide notable funding for genomics research. Programs like the All of Us Research Program and the Cancer Genome Atlas drive large-scale genomic studies. Federal support for genomics-based precision medicine and disease research fuels institutional dominance. Universities and research centers conduct early-stage genomics research,identifying disease pathways and novel drug targets. Research centers drive innovation in next-generation sequencing (NGS), CRISPR gene editing, and single-cell genomics. Institutions like the Broad institute and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory are leading advancements in computational genomics and synthetic biology. With strong government backing, advanced research capabilities, and extensive industry collaborations, research centers, academia, and government institutes remain the dominant force in the U.S.genomics market, driving innovation and large-scale genomic initiatives.\nThe hospitals & clinics segment is growing rapidly in the U.S. genomics market in 2024. Hospitals increasingly use genomics to tailor treatments based on a patient’s genetic profile, improving efficacy and reducing side effects. Pharmacogenomics helps doctors prescribe the right drugs at the right dose, reducing adverse reactions. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) allows oncologists to detect cancer mutations and choose targeted therapies (e.g., immunotherapies like keytruda). Hospitals are integrating liquid biopsy tests for non-invasive cancer screening and monitoring. Genomic sequencing is used to track and manage infectious diseases like COVID-19, tuberculosis, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Hospitals rely on microbial genomics for outbreak surveillance and infection control.U.S. healthcare policies are increasingly covering genomic testing for cancer, rare diseases, and prenatal care.\nRecent Developments in the U.S. Genomics Market Several key developments highlight the dynamism of the U.S. genomics market:\nIn February 2025, PATHOMIQ, Inc., partnered with Myriad Genetics, Inc., granting Myriad exclusive licensing rights to PATHOMIQ’s AI technology platform for prostate cancer, PATHOMIQ_PRAD, in the US.This collaboration aims to change how physicians treat cancer patients through machine learning and AI-enabled diagnostics. Also in February 2025, 10x Genomics, Inc., unveiled new product developments at\nAI: the Genomic Revolution – Unlocking personalized Medicine and Drug Discovery Is the convergence of artificial intelligence and genomics poised to revolutionize healthcare as we know it? The answer,quite simply,is a resounding yes.\nInterviewer: Dr. Evelyn Reed, a leading expert in genomic medicine, welcome to World Today News. Your work focuses on the intersection of AI and genomics. Could you begin by explaining the transformative impact of AI on genomics, particularly within the U.S. market?\nDr. Reed: The request of artificial intelligence to genomics is indeed transformative. AI’s power lies in its ability to sift through the massive datasets generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and other high-throughput genomic technologies. this allows for pattern recognition and the identification of subtle genetic variations—mutations, polymorphisms, and epigenetic changes—which would be impractical to detect using conventional methods. the U.S. market is a leader in this field due to significant investments in research and development, coupled with a robust healthcare infrastructure.
