Analysts, on average, were expecting $221.1 million.\n“There’s a marginal cost to Max, and that marginal cost is we call generative AI models to power what is the most important part of Max, which is the video call, and that did have about a 100-basis-point impact to gross margin,” Chief Financial Officer Matt Skaruppa told Reuters.\n“The first priority is innovating as quickly as possible, experimenting as quickly as possible to drive more engagement, and then the costs will come down over time.”\nThe firm also forecast adjusted core profit between $259.9 million and $274 million this year, below estimates of $272.1 million, largely due to costs related to its AI video call features.\nThe company said chatter around the TikTok ban in January and a marketing campaign in which the app’s mascot, Duo, faked his death and returned led to a jump in users in February.\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)\nDisclaimer: This report is auto generated from the Reuters news service.
