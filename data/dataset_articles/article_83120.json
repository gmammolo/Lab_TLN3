  "text": "On February 21st, the Department hosted its annual Research Day in the Frank Forward Building, celebrating the innovative research and efforts of our graduate students and researchers. The event kicked off at 10 am with opening remarks from the Department Head – Dr. Daan Maijer and the Associate Head of Graduate Programs – Dr. Ben Britton.\nThe day featured over 15 engaging oral presentations, complemented by breaks between sessions, allowing for a good mix of discussions and interaction. The day was filled with a dynamic atmosphere throughout the day – thanks to the audiences, who provided thoughtful questions and constructive feedback.\nDuring the productive lunch session, poster presentation segment gave researchers the opportunity to network in small groups and exchange ideas. The presentations highlighted the interdisciplinary nature of our department’s research clusters, reflecting our ongoing commitment to bridging fundamental research with real-world applications.\nThe event concluded with a celebration of our peers who received the major Graduate Awards and Scholarships to recognize their outstanding contributions to the field.\nAs research in materials engineering continues to evolve, such event plays a crucial role in fostering collaboration and innovation. We look forward to future gatherings where we can come together to share insights, inspire one another, and collectively shape the future of materials.",
