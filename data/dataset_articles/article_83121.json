  "text": "Classified in: Health , Science and technology\nSubject: TRI Foresight Diagnostics Expands Strategic Partnership with Allogene Therapeutics to Advance Joint Development Activities Outside of the U.S. Across Europe, UK, Canada and Australia\n- Expanded collaboration agreement with Allogene includes investment for further MRD assay development, clinical sample testing, milestone payments, and international expansion\nBOULDER, Colo. , Feb. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Foresight Diagnostics (\"the Company\"), a leader in ultra-sensitive minimal residual disease detection technology, today announced an expanded strategic collaboration with Allogene Therapeutics, Inc. to include the development of the Company's minimal residual disease (MRD) assay as a companion diagnostic to identify patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) for the treatment of cemacabtagene ansegedleucel (cema-cel) in Allogene's ALPHA3 clinical trial.\nUnder the strategic collaboration, Allogene and Foresight will work together to support the development of Foresight Diagnostics' MRD assay in the EU, UK, Canada and Australia in support of Allogene's clinical development of cema-cel. Cema-cel is being studied in the groundbreaking randomized controlled pivotal ALPHA3 trial as part of a first-line (1L) treatment to improve the cure rate in patients with LBCL. In the ALPHA3 trial, patients who achieve remission following initial treatment but remain positive for MRD, identified by using Foresight CLARITY tm IUO assay, will have an opportunity to receive cema-cel as a one-time consolidation dose to prevent disease recurrence.\n\"We are excited about our expanded collaboration with Allogene which will enable development of our MRD assay beyond the U.S.,\" said Sandra Close , PhD, Foresight Diagnostics' Chief Operations and Compliance Officer. \"This is an important milestone as we continue to support our biopharma partners implementing MRD-driven clinical trials globally.\"\nAbout Foresight Diagnostics\nForesight Diagnostics is a privately held cancer diagnostics company and CLIA-certified laboratory. Its liquid biopsy platform, Foresight CLARITYtm, is a novel assay that measures minimal residual disease (MRD) with reported detection limits in parts per million. The improved sensitivity of Foresight CLARITYtm has the potential to provide actionable information to physicians and biopharmaceutical companies to enable more personalized treatment approaches for patients with solid tumor and hematologic malignancies. For more information, please visit foresight-dx.com and follow us on X, LinkedIn, and Bluesky . Foresight CLARITYtm IUO is an investigational device. Limited by United States Law to investigational use.\nSOURCE Foresight Diagnostics, Inc.",
