  "text": "As artificial intelligence has become more popular in the academic setting, Texas Tech professors and students have found numerous ways to utilize AI in the classroom.\nMahedi Hasan, a Tech doctoral student and professor researching cyber-infrastructure and misinformation, said students continue to utilize AI tools despite attempts by instructors to restrict usage.\n“A lot of professors try to say that you cannot use AI, but the students will still be using it frequently in different forms,” Hasan said. “Maybe they are not saying they are using AI, but they will still find ways to use it.”\nVarious platforms, such as ChatGPT, Grammarly and QuillBot offer numerous functions for users, including idea brainstorming, essay writing, data analysis and note taking.\n“I would say AI can be a positive in the classroom, but only when using AI ethically,” Hasan said. “So, if you are writing a paper or an assignment, be sure that you are giving credit to AI or mention how you used it.”\nMatt Lengel, a second-year mechanical engineering major from Dallas, said he uses AI to assist in getting a start on assignments but does not rely on it for full completion.\n“I have used AI in a sense of plugging in some information and asking if it can help me with a start for an essay, or to help me think of some sort of introduction that I can use and build off of that,” Lengel said. “I don’t plagiarize off whatever an AI bot gives me, but I use it more as a resource.”\nIn a survey conducted by Statistica in 2024, 86 percent of global students utilized AI in their coursework in some way, and almost a fourth of polled students used AI daily.\nLengel also said AI can be detrimental or beneficial for learning depending on how it is used.\n“I think whether or not AI is positive or negative has to do with how a person uses it,” Lengel said. “If you just plug something into a bot and completely just take whatever it says and not use any of your thinking on it, then I think it can negatively affect you.”\nIn not knowing where data is being pulled from, Hasan said AI could diminish the accuracy in one’s work.\n“Some of the biggest risks with AI usage is misinformation and plagiarism,” Hasan said. “It provides random information where you don't know who the inventor of that work is or who provided it. This tool could make you lose credibility in your work.”\nHasan said when using AI, it is important to double check work along with performing fact checks on listed information.\n“You can use AI for assisting with some work, but you can’t just have it doing the work for you,” Hasan said. “It could be the assistant, but it cannot be the owner of the work. Be sure to verify or double check sources, research the terms the AI lists and always cite the AI and give it credit.”\nKeira Petty, a first-year architecture major from Boerne, said relying on AI for ideas rather than oneself can negatively affect critical thinking skills.\n“I think AI kind of diminishes your ability to think your own thoughts in a way,” Petty said. “For example, if you use it to write your essay for you, you're not the one coming up with those ideas; you're giving it a thesis, but it's doing all the work for you.”\nAccording to the Tech Student Code of Conduct, plagiarism includes the uncited usage of words, ideas, data or other media that are not one’s own. Cheating is defined as the utilization of resources and platforms not otherwise approved by administrators.",
