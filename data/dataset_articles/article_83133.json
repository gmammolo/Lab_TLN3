  "text": "Photo Credit: Getty Images\nFaurecia (Nanterre, France) — a Forvia Group brand — as well as Michelin (Clermont-Ferrand, France) and Stellantis (Hoofddorp, Netherlands) have begun exclusive negotiations for Stellantis to acquire a substantial stake in Symbio, a zero-emissions hydrogen mobility company, in order to become a significant player along with existing shareholders Faurecia and Michelin.\n“Symbio’s technical roadmap perfectly matches with Stellantis’ hydrogen roll-out plans in Europe and in the U.S.,” Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares says. “This move will foster the speed of development to bring low-emission products to our customers, beyond traditional electric vehicles.”",
