  "text": "Photo Credit: ZeroAvia/Kate Barabanova\nOn Jan. 19 ZeroAvia (Kemble, U.K.) flew what the company claims to be the largest aircraft in the world to be powered by a hydrogen-electric engine. The zero-emission aviation company took to the skies for the maiden flight of its 19-seat Dornier 228 testbed aircraft, retrofitted with a full-size prototype hydrogen-electric powertrain on the left wing of the aircraft.\nThe flight took place from the company’s R&D facility at Cotswold Airport in Gloucestershire, U.K., and lasted 10 minutes. At 1:35 p.m. GMT the aircraft completed taxi, takeoff, a full pattern circuit and landing. The landmark flight forms part of the HyFlyer II project, a major R&D program backed by the UK government’s flagship ATI Program, which targets development of a 600-kilowatt powertrain to support 9-19 seat aircraft worldwide with zero-emission flight.",
