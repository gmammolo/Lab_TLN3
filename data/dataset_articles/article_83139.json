  "text": "Blackwell AI chip rollout fuels Nvidia’s revenue surge\nSurging Blackwell chip orders ease concerns about a slowdown in AI demand, strengthening Nvidia’s growth outlook.\nNvidia has forecast strong growth for the first quarter, reinforcing confidence in the booming demand for AI chips. Orders for the company’s new Blackwell semiconductors were described as ‘amazing’, with CEO Jensen Huang stating that AI is advancing rapidly.\nInvestors had raised concerns last month after Chinese startup DeepSeek claimed to have developed cost-efficient AI models, but Nvidia’s results eased doubts.\nAnalysts had expressed scepticism about the transition to Blackwell and competition from DeepSeek, but the latest figures reassured investors.\nMargins remain under pressure, with Nvidia forecasting a slight drop to 71% in the first quarter, below Wall Street estimates. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress expects a recovery later in the year as production scales up and costs decline.\nDespite some concerns about oversupply in AI infrastructure, Chinese firms have reportedly increased orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chip, further supporting demand.\nNvidia’s fourth-quarter revenue rose 78% to $39.3 billion, surpassing expectations. Data centre sales surged 93% to $35.6 billion, continuing strong growth from the previous quarter.\nInvestors remain focused on Nvidia’s ability to maintain momentum in a competitive AI landscape, particularly as tech giants like Microsoft and Meta commit substantial investments to AI expansion.\nFor more information on these topics, visit diplomacy.edu.",
