  "text": "CoreWeave, a cloud computing firm backed by chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), is reportedly close to filing its $4 billion initial public offering (IPO), which could happen as soon as next week. According to Bloomberg, the company is seeking a valuation of $35 billion or more. This move comes after CoreWeave added a $650 million credit line to its balance sheet in October in order to improve its financial position.\nAs a specialized cloud services provider, CoreWeave leases access to Nvidia’s AI chips from its 14 data centers. The company was founded in 2017 and was the first to join Nvidia’s Partner Network. CoreWeave seems like it is well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for cloud-based AI services thanks to its strong backing and growing financial resources.\nIn fact, CoreWeave has already raised a significant amount of funding, which includes $12.7 billion in equity and debt financing. Notably, the company secured $2.3 billion in debt financing in August 2023 in a deal backed by Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips. With its plans to go public in 2025, CoreWeave is looking to further expand its operation.\nIs NVDA a Good Stock to Buy?\nAlthough you can’t invest in CoreWeave yet, you can invest in Nvidia. When turning to Wall Street, analysts remain bullish on NVDA stock, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. After a 57% rally in its share price over the past year, the average NVDA price target of $178.66 per share implies an upside potential of 46.4% from current levels.",
