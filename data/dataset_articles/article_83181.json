  "text": "The Brief Chicagoan Elaine Hyde fulfilled her lifelong dream of space travel, joining a six-person crew for a 10-minute Blue Origin flight. Hyde made history as the first Australian woman and Singapore-born person to travel to space. Blue Origin announced its next mission will feature an all-female crew, including pop star Katy Perry and CBS anchor Gayle King, launching this spring. CHICAGO - A Chicago woman has just returned from Blue Origins' latest space flight.\nWhat we know:\nElaine Hyde, founder of Chicago Star Media, has dreamed of outer space since she was a little girl.\nHer dream became a reality Tuesday when she joined a six-person crew for a 10-minute, 3-second flight to space.\n\"It's infused me with a new perspective of how to see life and new ideas can form. I've spent a lifetime dreaming about going to space. I've tried to imagine myself there countless times. However, going there, realizing it's real, now I've got this new energy in me to, to imagine and dream of future possibilities that could not have been done before,\" said Hyde.\nHyde, a dual citizen of the United States and Australia, made history as the first Australian woman and Singapore-born person to journey to space.\nAll-Female Crew:\nOn Thursday, Blue Origin announced its next flight will feature an all-female crew.\nPop star Katy Perry, CBS anchor Gayle King, and Lauren Sanchez, the fiancé of Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos, are set to be part of the team.\nThey will be joined by former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerrianne Flynn.\nThe mission will mark the 11th human flight for Blue Origin’s New Shepard Program and the 31st in the company’s history.\nWhat's next:\nSo far, Blue Origin’s New Shepard Program has flown 52 people to the internationally recognized boundary of space.\nThis all-female crew will be the first since cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova’s solo space flight in 1963.\nThe crew is set to launch this spring.",
