  "text": "Fortnite offers second chance for players who received lifetime bans by Ryan Lemay Published: Feb 27, 2025, 21:45\nSave for later\nSave for later Epic Games Fortnite players who are currently serving a ban have been given a second chance by Epic Games.\nIn December, Epic Games restructured the rules for competing in FNCS Divisional Cups and other competitive Fortnite tournaments for cash prizes to combat cheating.\nThis included ramping up legal action against cheaters. For example, Epic Games filed a lawsuit against a player who used cheating software and hardware during a tournament.\nThen, the devs went one step further and had a cheater post an apology video after receiving a permanent ban for unfairly qualifying for FNCS. In addition, the player forfeited prize money earned in the tournament, and Epic donated it to charity.\nArticle continues after ad Epic Games has taken a hard stance against cheating, but that doesn’t mean the developers don’t believe players deserve a second chance.\nFortnite offers a lifeline to banned players Epic Games Epic Games announced, “Starting in April, we’ll be moving to a one-year matchmaking ban for first-time cheating offenses, allowing former cheaters to learn from their mistakes while still punishing and deterring cheating. A second offense will result in a lifetime ban.”\nArticle continues after ad During the first ban, players can log in and use text and voice chat with other players but cannot matchmake or spectate.\nArticle continues after ad As part of the new policy, cheating bans that have been in effect for over a year will be lifted. Here is an explanation for all of the new rules.\nPlayers who have used cheats: One-year matchmaking ban for the first offense, lifetime ban for the second.\n Players who have used cheats and participate in tournaments: One-year matchmaking ban + immediate lifetime ban from tournaments + potential loss of past tournament winnings. A second offense of using cheats will result in a lifetime ban.\n Players who have sold cheats or broken other rules resulting in a lifetime ban: Nothing changes. The lifetime ban is still in effect.
