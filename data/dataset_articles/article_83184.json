  "text": "News\nDeutsche Telekom Joins Injective Blockchain as Network Validator\nDeutsche Telekom, the parent company of T-Mobile, has become a validator for Injective, a high-speed interoperable Layer 1 blockchain focused on decentralized finance (DeFi), according to an announcement made Thursday. This addition represents Deutsche Telekom's continued expansion into the cryptocurrency space, according to a report from Block.\nAs a validator, Deutsche Telekom will help secure the Injective network and validate transactions. The telecommunications giant will receive a portion of the network's staking rewards and transaction fees, which can total over 10% APY depending on network conditions.\n\"We are thrilled to have one of the world's leading telecommunications companies partnering with Injective to help secure our network and validate transactions,\" said Injective CEO Eric Chen in a statement. Chen added that this partnership demonstrates how Web3 is becoming \"more institutional and fully integrated into society.\"\nInjective began as a Cosmos-based decentralized exchange operating on a dedicated appchain that utilized cross-chain bridges to enable trading across various platforms, including Ethereum and Polkadot. The protocol was among the first to implement an order book model rather than an automated market maker like Uniswap for managing liquidity. Notably, Injective was incubated by Binance and has received backing from several prominent investors including:\n- Jump Crypto\n- Pantera\n- Mark Cuban\nDeutsche Telekom, headquartered in Bonn, Germany, serves over 250 million customers worldwide through its mobile, broadband, and fixed-line services, including its U.S. operations through T-Mobile. The company has been building a substantial presence in the cryptocurrency sector since at least 2020, primarily as a validator. Deutsche Telekom currently operates or has operated validators on multiple blockchain networks including Polygon, Polkadot, Chainlink, Celo, Flow, and more recently, NEAR. The company has also made strategic investments in several of these chains' native tokens.\nBeyond its validator roles, Deutsche Telekom has established itself in the blockchain space as a node operator for Ethereum, Bitcoin, and the Lightning network. Last year, the telecommunications company launched a Bitcoin mining pilot project with Bankhaus Metzler that uses renewable energy sources.\nBroader Context in U.S. State Legislation\nDeutsche Telekom's move into Injective validation comes as U.S. states are increasingly exploring blockchain adoption. Oklahoma's State House Committee recently advanced the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill (House Bill 1203) with a 12-2 majority vote. The legislation, if passed by the full House, would permit the state treasury to invest 10% of public funds in Bitcoin and other digital assets with market values exceeding $500 billion. This development coincides with Bitcoin trading below $90,000, having fallen 6.78% on February 25 before making a slight recovery to $89,236.\nMarket Movements Among Major Investment Firms\nThe institutional interest exemplified by Deutsche Telekom's validator role reflects broader industry trends. Ark Invest recently purchased 41,032 Coinbase shares worth $8.7 million for its Next Generation Internet ETF, while simultaneously selling $8.6 million of its own spot Bitcoin ETF during the recent market decline. This balanced approach demonstrates how large institutions are diversifying their crypto exposure across different segments of the blockchain ecosystem, similar to how Deutsche Telekom has expanded its validator operations across multiple networks while making strategic token investments.",
