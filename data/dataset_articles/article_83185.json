  "text": "Blue Origin says its next spaceflight is set to make history.\nWith celebrities such as Katy Perry, Lauren Sánchez and Gayle King on board, the all-woman crew will fly into space when the New Shepard spacecraft launches from the West Texas desert this spring. The company says it's the first all-woman flight since the Soviet Union's Valentina Tereshkova’s solo spaceflight in 1963.\nThe flight comes as Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin continues to become a major player in the commercial space industry – competing with the likes of Elon Musk's SpaceX for NASA's business as well as the business of other private companies.\nDuring the 11-minute journey, the crew of the New Shepard will soar past the \"Kármán line,\" the internationally recognized boundary of space, experiencing several minutes of weightlessness and witnessing views of Earth through windows that take up more than one-third of the capsule’s surface area.\nhttps://www.yahoo.com/news/celebrities-headed-space-historic-woman-135020649.html",
