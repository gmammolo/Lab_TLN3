  "text": "Improved application selection\nWe're making it easier to choose the correct application type right from the start. After clicking \"Start an application,\" you'll see clear options for:\n- New business application\n- Replacement, conversion or option\n- Special quote application\n- Supplementary application\nRemember: For external replacements (non-Sun Life business), select New business application. For internal Sun Life replacements or conversions, always choose Replacement, conversion or option.\nUnderwriting evidence collection method\nWhen eligible for Instant Approval (IA) or Straight Through Underwriting (STU), using the default Non-medical option can lead to faster processing times. If you select Tele-interview in these scenarios, you'll now see a warning pop-up to comfirm this is your intended choice.\nThese updates will help reduce unnecessary delays and improve overall application processing times.
