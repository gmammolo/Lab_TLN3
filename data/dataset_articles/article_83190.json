  "text": "Xperi says its DTS AutoStage global installed base of vehicles has topped 10 million cars, doubling on a year-over-year basis and exceeding the company’s target as it tries to lay the groundwork for future monetization-based revenue streams.\nThe company announced its Connected Car achievements during its fourth-quarter and full-year results, which were announced Wednesday.\n“Overall, it was a positive quarter of execution for our independent media platform strategy, and we look forward to beginning to turn the corner on monetization growth as we progress through the year,” Xperi CEO and Director Jon Kirchner said on a call with analysts. “Our Connected Car business saw continued footprint momentum during the quarter. For DTS AutoStage, we now have a footprint of over 10 million vehicles, which exceeds our original goal of seven million.\n“Additionally, by adding a Japanese automotive brand in the quarter, we met our goal of three incremental DTS AutoStage design wins, including one that included video service powered by TiVo. Several new models of AutoStage launched in the quarter from six brands including BMW, Hyundai, Mercedes, and Nissan.”\nXperi reported a slight increase in 2024 revenue, adjusted for divested businesses, with growth in IPTV and Connected Car segments offsetting declines in legacy solutions. The company doubled its year-over-year adjusted EBITDA, reflecting its successful business transformation and improved profitability.\nGoing forward, Xperi aims to further expand its Smart TV and connected car footprints. It has increased its footprint goal on DTS AutoStage to more than 15 million cars, producing over $20 million in revenue. The company projects 2025 revenue of $480 million to $500 million.\nXperi says HR Radio has been implemented in more than 110 million vehicles, and that penetration is approaching 60% of new cars shipped each year in North America.\n“We closed the 2024 fiscal year on a strong operational note, making significant strides in expanding our independent media platform footprint across Smart TV, connected car, and video-over-broadband,” Kirchner said. “This progress validates the value proposition of our independent media platform and further demonstrates how Xperi is enhancing the way people discover, watch, and enjoy their favorite content.”\nMeanwhile, Xperi said it reached a TiVo OS milestone of more than 2 million activated Smart TVs and ended last year with 2.6 million video-over-broadband (IPTV) subscriber households, up 37% year over year.\nXperi also said it repurchased $10 million of its common stock in Q4 2024 at an average price of $9.57.\n“Looking ahead to 2025, we will maintain our focus on growing revenue within our strategic initiatives, including by expanding our Smart TV footprint, accelerating deployment of TiVo video-over-broadband, and growing our DTS AutoStage footprint,” Kirchner said. “As our user base of connected devices expands, the scale and unique audiences we reach is expected to create significant monetization opportunities.”",
