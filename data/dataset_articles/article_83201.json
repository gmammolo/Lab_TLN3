This landmark initiative provides dedicated access to AI learning tools, creating new opportunities for the next generation to thrive in today’s hyper-personalised world.\nEng. Eranga Weeraratna, Deputy Minister of Digital Economy, stated, “SLT-MOBITEL’s Hello AI package aligns with the government’s national vision for digital transformation and AI adoption. As Sri Lanka strives to advance in the global digital economy, initiatives such as this play a crucial role in democratising access to advanced technologies. By empowering youth with affordable access to AI tools and educational platforms, we can build a digitally skilled workforce to drive Sri Lanka’s future economic growth.”\nThe pioneering Hello AI package, priced at just Rs 799, offers an unprecedented 40GB of data—20GB anytime and 20GB nighttime—along with an additional dedicated 10GB for accessing leading AI and educational platforms, including ChatGPT, Deepseek, Claude, Copilot, Coursera, Udemy, and Canva. The package also includes 200 minutes of free calls to any network, making it a comprehensive solution for young users.\nExclusively designed to meet the growing demand for AI-powered tools among students and young professionals, the package ensures users can explore and learn without concerns about regular data consumption. The nighttime data allocation further facilitates extended learning sessions during off-peak hours.\nSpeaking at the launch ceremony, Dr. Mothilal De Silva, Chairman of the SLT-MOBITEL Group, explained, “The launch of Hello AI illustrates SLT-MOBITEL’s evolution beyond traditional telecommunications into a catalyst for digital transformation. By making advanced AI tools and educational platforms accessible to Sri Lankan youth at an affordable price, SLT-MOBITEL is fostering skills development and innovation. This initiative reflects our commitment to preparing the next generation for an AI-driven future, ensuring they can compete and succeed in the global digital economy.”\nWith Hello AI, SLT-MOBITEL aims to provide Sri Lankan youth aged 16–25 with a gateway to future learning and innovation. As the first telecom provider in Sri Lanka to offer specialised data access to AI platforms, SLT-MOBITEL seeks to empower the next generation by enhancing their skills and keeping them competitive in an AI-driven world.\nThe Hello AI package caters to students exploring AI tools for academic projects, young professionals looking to upskill, creative individuals using AI-powered design tools, and aspiring developers and tech enthusiasts. By making advanced learning tools accessible to all youth segments at an affordable price, the package reinforces SLT-MOBITEL’s commitment to driving digital inclusion and innovation in Sri Lanka.",
