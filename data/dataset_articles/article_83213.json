  "text": "Korea’s leading auto, electronics giants expand partnership with series of collaboration announcements\nKia has partnered with Samsung Electronics to advance the digital experience of the former’s Platform Beyond Vehicle, or PBV, offerings by integrating the latter’s internet of things, or IoT, solutions into the Kia PBVs, the automaker said Thursday.\nAccording to Kia, the two signed a memorandum of understanding during Kia’s 2025 EV Day held in Tarragona, Spain, on Monday to mark the latest collaboration announcement between Korea’s two leading conglomerates -- Hyundai Motor Group and Samsung Group -- after they consecutively unveiled a series of plans to work together in robot-dedicated batteries and smart factories earlier this week.\nUnder the agreement, Samsung’s business-to-business IoT platform -- SmartThings Pro -- will be applied to Kia PBVs to enable automated connectivity with business spaces. This solution is expected to help business customers integrate and manage IoT-enabled appliances without complex installations, allowing users to set up certain routines based on the destination entered into the vehicle’s infotainment system.\nFor example, if a bakery owner were to set a wholesale market as her destination in a Kia PBV, the pre-programmed routine would automatically activate an ingredient purchase mode so that the car’s internal cooling system makes sure the purchased food stays fresh during the drive.\nAfter visiting the market, the bakery owner could set her own store as the next destination in the PBV to activate a commute mode that turns on the air conditioning, signage and other equipment in the store while producing a to-do list as the system checks the inventory.\nWhile on the road after business hours, the bakery owner could also activate a closing mode that ensures devices in the shop are turned off, energy-saving measures are applied and security features are engaged. The system sends real-time notifications to the PBV if unusual activities or system malfunctions are detected.\nA guesthouse owner, meanwhile, could activate an unmanned operation mode that enables remote check-in and check-out, unlocks room doors for visitors and controls electronic devices.\n“Kia PBVs are designed to be more than just vehicles -- they are intelligent business solutions that connect seamlessly with digital ecosystems,” said Kim Sang-dae, head of Kia’s PBV Division.\n\"We anticipate that our business collaboration with Samsung, leveraging its AI B2B solution SmartThings Pro, will extend the vehicle user experience for our business customers beyond PBVs into the broader IoT ecosystem. This partnership is expected to create new opportunities to bring value to the customer.\"\nOn top of the examples already mentioned, the collaboration between Kia and Samsung is expected to yield other IoT solutions specifically customized to the needs of PBV drivers across a range of industries in global markets.\n\"By integrating SmartThings Pro into Kia PBVs, we plan to present an intelligent new way for businesses to connect to their customers,\" said Park Chan-woo, executive vice president of the B2B Integrated Offering Center at Samsung Electronics.\n\"We will provide an optimized, integrated store management experience based on customized solutions to cater to a range of B2B customers, including the self-employed and small business owners.\"\nDuring the EV Day event, Kia unveiled the PV5, its first PBV model, along with the latest versions of the EV4 and EV2 concept cars.\nBy Kan Hyeong-woo (hwkan@heraldcorp.com)",
