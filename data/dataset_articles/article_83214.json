  "text": "After a successful Kickstarter campaign that surpassed its goal by 500 percent, Full On Lighting has released its first product–the MB6 mountain bike light–for general ordering. Designed for night riding, the US$385 light kicks out more than 6000 lumens in a near 180-degree pattern for increased peripheral awareness, the Victoria, Canada-based company says. With its Active Light Control mode, the MB6 uses an accelerometer to automatically adjust brightness and beam angle based on the user’s speed. Courtesy Full On Lighting “One problem with the lights currently on the market is that the majority of them focus the light in the centre, which causes tunnel vision,” Full On Lighting said on its Kickstarter page. “Our sense of speed and spatial awareness come from our peripheral vision, and the current bike lights didn’t do a good job of filling the riders entire field of view.” The 74Wh external battery lasts an average of 2.5 hours in Manual High mode, and up to 22 hours in Manual Hangout Mode (275 lumens). Full On Lighting says it went with a cabled battery as opposed to an internal battery for heat management, longer run time and weight balance. Additionally, the battery can be quickly swapped out and doubles as a USB-C port charger. The light comes with flat and curved GoPro-style mounts for attachment to helmets or bikes. The light portion weighs less than 120g. Full On Lighting raised CA $53,895 from 117 backers with a goal of $10,000. Backers received a 30-percent discount, and Full On Lighting announced on Jan. 24 that all Kickstarter orders have been shipped. Full On Lighting was founded in 2023 by Sean Bourguin, who previously founded First Light Technologies Ltd. solar lighting company. An avid mountain biker, Bourguin and his team of three developed and fund-raised the MB6 through 2024. More information about the MB6 can be found here .",
