  "text": "OpenAI has started rolling out GPT-4.5, its most powerful AI model for chat, with Pro users gaining access first, followed by Plus and Team users next week, and Enterprise and Edu users the week after.\nThe company said on Thursday that GPT-4.5 is a major step forward, offering a more natural and intuitive user experience with improved ability to understand intent, recognize patterns, and generate creative insights. Just take a look at the example ask below from a user wanting to generate a text message reply to a friend:\nAccording to OpenAI, early testing shows GPT-4.5 feels more fluid and responsive, making it more effective for tasks like writing, coding, and problem-solving. The model has an expanded knowledge base with real-time search access, supports file and image uploads, and includes canvas tools for working on writing and code. There’s one downside for now, and that is multimodal features like Voice Mode, video, and screen sharing are not yet available in GPT-4.5.\nThis release comes after xAI released Grok 3, which it dubbed the “smarted AI in the world”. Let the ongoing AI wars continue.\nOpenAI says GPT-4.5 marks an important step in scaling AI training through improved unsupervised learning techniques. The company aims to further refine the user experience, with a long-term goal of making AI tools work seamlessly in everyday life. We’re still at the beginning of this AI wave and it’s getting scarier by the day, as generative AI is getting smarter and even more human-like.\nCheck out the OpenAI team giving a demo of GPT-4.5 below:\nToday we’re releasing a research preview of GPT-4.5—our largest and best model for chat yet.\nRolling out now to all ChatGPT Pro users, followed by Plus and Team users next week, then Enterprise and Edu users the following week.\n[pic.twitter.com/br5win5OEB]— OpenAI (@OpenAI)\n[February 27, 2025]",
