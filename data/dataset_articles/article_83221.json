  "text": "Shares of SoundHound AI (SOUN) jumped in after-hours trading after the voice AI software company reported earnings for its fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. Earnings per share came in at -$0.05, which beat analysts’ consensus estimate of -$0.10 per share. In addition, sales increased by 101% year-over-year, with revenue hitting $34.5 million. This also beat analysts’ expectations of $33.7 million.\nCEO and Co-Founder of SoundHound AI, Keyvan Mohajer, attributed the company’s success to major customer wins and expanding partnerships. Indeed, some major customers include Burger King UK and Lucid Motors (LCID).\nSoundHound Updates Guidance\nLooking forward, management has provided the following updated guidance for 2025:\n- FY25 revenue between $157 million to $177 million versus estimates of $165.3 million\nAs you can see, guidance was better than expected, with the midpoint figure of $167 million surpassing consensus estimates. This, combined with the firm’s solid Q4 results, led to the after-hours gain.\nInvestor Sentiment for SOUN Stock\nThe sentiment among TipRanks investors is currently very negative. Out of the 789,147 portfolios tracked by TipRanks, 2.2% hold SOUN stock. In addition, the average portfolio weighting allocated towards SOUN among those who do have a position is 5.14%. This suggests that investors in the company are fairly confident about its future. However, in the past 30 days, the percentage change in the number of portfolios holding the stock fell by 1.2%.\nIs SOUN Stock a Good Investment?\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on SOUN stock based on two Buys, two Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 45% rally in its share price over the past year, the average SOUN price target of $16.50 per share implies 79.1% upside potential. However, it’s worth noting that estimates will likely change following today’s earnings report.",
