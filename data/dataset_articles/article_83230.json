  "text": "The correction of errors is, all good expert will tell us, the great challenge of quantum computer science. Qued, extremely sensitive to environmental disturbances such as vibrations, heat or electromagnetic interference, require complex mechanisms to maintain their quantum state. Traditional approaches require significant resources, which still make the development of large -scale quantum computers prohibitive.",
