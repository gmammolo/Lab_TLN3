  "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Netflix has acquired the wildly popular Audible Originals podcast Impact Winter, to be developed for series with Hunger Games helmer Francis Lawrence directing. The series is created by Travis Beacham, whose script work includes Carnival Row, Pacific Rim and Clash of the Titans.\nThe ambition of the series is 30 Days of Night meets The Last of Us. A comet hits the earth and the results are apocalyptic. As a result, the sun is blocked out, and humans become pitted against vampires. The way in is two sisters who find themselves on opposite sides of the war.\nThe bestselling podcast plays out on the order of an old radio teleplay like War of the Worlds by Orson Welles. The podcast has three seasons with a fourth coming, and has racked up nearly 6 million subscribers.\nWatch on Deadline\nNetflix had no comment on the deal.\nSkybound and Anonymous Content are the studios. The executive producers are Beacham, Lawrence, Cameron MacConomy, Rick Jacobs, Glenn Geller, Cliff Roberts, Bard Dorros and Zack Hayden.\nLawrence is repped by CAA and 3Arts; Beacham is UTA, Anonymous Content and Syndicate Entertainment.",
