  "text": "The Google app’s Song Search capability is excellent and finally has a history shortcut to see past lookups. It’s available today in Google for iOS, but Song Search history can be accessed by anyone on the web.\nLaunching Song Search on iOS reveals a new history button in the top-right corner. This takes you to a “Recent Song Searches” page that shows your last 10 results. This includes Song Search in Circle to Search and every other instance of the feature.\nEach card features album artwork (if available), song name, artist, and when the search was performed. A tap opens Google Search and the song’s Knowledge Panel.\nAt the bottom of this page is a “Show Full History” button that opens myactivity.google.com to a “Song Search” filter. This history goes back years (2017 in my case) and might have been available this entire time. Newer entries include the original audio input used.\nVisit myactivity.google.com/myactivity?product=17 directly to start browsing.\nThis prominent shortcut to history is a nice addition, though having to first start a Song Search to access results in “Listened to unrecognized song” appearing in My Activity. A direct shortcut, possibly in the Google app’s Saved tab would be nice.\nMore on Song Search:",
