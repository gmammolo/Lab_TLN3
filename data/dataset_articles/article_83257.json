  "text": "Summary\n- MercurySteam is back with Blades of Fire, reminiscent of Lords of Shadow art style.\n- The game features a unique weapon forging system and offers tactical combat options.\n- Blades of Fire promises over 50 enemy types, intricate settings, and a companion character.\nRemember MercurySteam, the Spanish video game studio that became prominent thanks to Castlevania: Lords of Shadow? The studio is back in the action genre with its new game, Blades of Fire, which was revealed today.\nBased on the trailer revealed today, the studio looks to be bringing back the art style from Lords of Shadow. Publisher 505 Games has also detailed the game's story and features.\nRelated\n Castlevania: Nocturne's New Season 2 Trailer Reminds Us Why It's The Best Anime On Netflix\nCastlevania: Nocturne's second season looks like it's going to be as excellent as the rest of the series. Here's why.\nBlades of Fire Brings the Familiar Lords of Shadow Look\nPer the press release, \"Step forward Aran de Lira, the last hero who can wield steel, and Adso, a young scholar whose knowledge of lost myths and sacred tongues may shape their fate. Learn how to craft near limitless weapon variations in the game’s unique ‘weapons forging’ system and bring the Queen to her knees. Combine countless alloys, hilts, runes, blades and pummelling edges to craft and perfect the ultimate evil-slaying weapon. Every enemy type will pose unique challenges – every weapon you create will meet those challenges!\"\nKey Features:\nTHE DIVINE METAL: You are Aran de Lira, firstborn of the King’s Ward. The newly crowned Queen Nerea has cast a spell that turns steel into stone. Only her army of abominations wield the divine metal against which other blades shatter.\nTHE FORGE: Find Forge Scrolls, develop your forging skills and craft your weapon to suit your fighting style. The chosen weapon family and the materials you create it from will affect characteristics such as weight, length, durability, penetration and edge quality.\nCHOOSE YOUR WEAPON: Choose between seven different weapon families and over 30 unique Forge Scrolls, which allow almost infinite weapon combinations. Your choice of weapon will be crucial when facing your enemy!\nTACTICAL COMBAT: A unique and challenging combat system which allows you to attack specific body parts of the enemy. Slash, stab or bludgeon enemies depending on the situation and what the enemy is equipped with. Only the right weapon will allow you to overcome the enemy’s armour.\nYOU ARE NOT ALONE: Adso is Aran’s companion, a curious scholar drawn into the hero’s journey by fate. Though no warrior, his keen mind and ancient knowledge will prove invaluable. He observes, learns, and chronicles their path, offering insights that may turn the tide of battle. Most importantly, he speaks the lost tongue of the divine forgers—a key to unlocking the mysteries ahead.\nBE ON GUARD: Over 50 enemy types, including the Queen’s guards, creatures, undead and more. Each enemy has its own unique attack style, weapon, and armour setup.\nA WORLD FULL OF MYSTERY: Aran and Adso embark on an uncertain mission. The objective is clear, but the path is full of dangers, mysteries and epic settings such as huge castles, maze-like palaces and more. You will know only what our heroes know, your intuition and courage must fill in the rest.\nRelated\n 15 Best Anime Like Castlevania\nVenture beyond Castlevania to discover anime like Chainsaw Man, Goblin Slayer, and the Blood of Zeus.\nWhile MercurySteam released games after Castlevania: Lords of Shadows, it didn't quite catch on in terms of critical and commercial appeal.\nLords of Shadow was released in 2010 for the PS3, Xbox 360, and PC and was a reimagined take on the Castlevania franchise. It was a great action game with an amazing story. Our review then highlighted the game's bosses and cinematics as part of the appeal.\nUnfortunately, its sequel, Lords of Shadow 2, was not only marred by technical issues, but even the gameplay didn't live up to its potential, which our review noted as well, giving it a 5.5/10 score. Rounding out the trilogy was Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate, which didn't even get a home console release, and was relegated to the Nintendo DS.\nWill MercurySteam be able to bring back its past glory with Blade of Fire? It seems to be on the right track. Luckily, we won't have to wait long, as the game will be available on May 22 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC (via Epic Games Store) for $59.99.\nRelated\n 10 Best Vampire Manga, Ranked\nDive into some of the best vampire manga series like Hellsing, Seraph of the End, and Blood+ for a thrilling read.\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadow\n- Franchise\nCastlevania- Released\n- October 5, 2010\n- Developer(s)\n- Multiplayer\n- Local Multiplayer",
