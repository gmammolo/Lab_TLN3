  "text": "VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESS Newswire / February 27, 2025 / Onco-Innovations Limited (CSE: ONCO )(OTCQB: ONNVF )(Frankfurt: W1H ,WKN: A3EKSZ ) (\" Onco \" or the \" Company \") is pleased to provide information regarding its wholly-owned subsidiary, Inka Health (\"Inka\"), which has made significant strides in advancing AI-driven oncology research by leading a transformative study protocol 1 published in medRxiv in September 2024 , focused on AI-generated synthetic patient models. This innovative research aims to advance the study of oncology by creating synthetic patient data, thereby leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to overcome critical challenges, particularly in the study of rare cancers where traditional patient data is often unavailable or difficult to obtain.\nThe study, entitled, \" External Control Arm with Synthetic Real-world Data for Comparative Oncology using Single Trial Arm Evidence (ECLIPSE): A Case Study using Lung-MAP S1400I \" is led by Dr. Winson Cheung, Medical Advisor at Inka Health and Professor of Medicine at the University of Calgary, and brought together an esteemed team of oncology experts, including Inka Health co-founders Dr. Paul Arora and Dr. Alind Gupta, along with a consortium of world-renowned cancer researchers and private sector partners (Subsalt and Quantify Health). This exciting initiative seeks to develop synthetic patient cohorts using AI technology, a core element of digital twin technology, to address gaps in oncology research and accelerate clinical trial design by quickly generating comparator arms for trials. The Company believes that this is particularly critical in the rare cancer setting where randomizing patients to control arms (comparison groups without the new treatment) 2 is often infeasible. Ultimately, this approach aims to improve the pace and effectiveness of cancer treatments.\nThis study, led by Inka Health, has the potential to impact not only Onco-Innovation's cancer research but also the broader healthcare landscape by providing a scalable, data-driven solution to the challenges of studying rare and hard-to-treat cancers. As part of this ongoing initiative, Inka is working to expand its proprietary AI-driven platform, SynoGraph, which enhances patient stratification, improves clinical trial efficiency, and advances precision oncology solutions. By incorporating synthetic real-world data, SynoGraph aims to offer the pharmaceutical and biotech industries a powerful tool to speed up drug development and regulatory processes.\n\" The ability to create synthetic patient models using AI is an exciting milestone for oncology research. Traditional data limitations have long hindered progress, especially for rare cancers where patient data is scarce. With this technology, we can simulate diverse patient populations, with the potential to improve how clinical trials are designed, \" said Paul Arora, CEO of Inka Health.\n\"AI-driven synthetic patient models represent a potentially major leap in oncology research. By generating high-fidelity digital replicas of real patients, we can overcome data gaps that have historically slowed advancements, particularly for rare cancers and underrepresented populations. This approach has the potential to enhance clinical trial design, optimize treatment strategies, and accelerate the development of life-saving therapies, \" said Winson Cheung, Professor of Medicine at the University of Calgary and Medical Advisor at Inka Health.\nAbout Onco-Innovations Limited\nOnco-Innovations is a Canadian-based company dedicated to cancer research and treatment, specializing in oncology.
