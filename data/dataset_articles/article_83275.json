  "text": "Litecoin has surged over 9% in the past 24 hours, buoyed by the announcement of its official “.ltc” domain extension and robust technical indicators, pushing the price above $131. With growing Litecoin ETF optimism, improved performance against Bitcoin, and rising network fundamentals, analysts are eyeing a breakout to $160 by March.\nQuick Take\n-\nLTC has risen around 4.3% in the past 24 hours and by nearly 14% in the last 30 days, following the domain extension announcement.\n-\nThe emerging inverse head and shoulders pattern points to a potential breakout above $130, targeting $160 by March.\n-\nThe LTC/BTC pair has climbed approximately 40% YTD, significantly outperforming\nEthereumandSolana. -\nLitecoin’s all-time high\nhashrateand reduced miner selling pressure signal enhanced network security and confidence. -\nHigh approval odds for a Litecoin ETF (up to 90% likelihood) are driving renewed institutional and retail interest.\nDomain Extension Sparks Market Optimism\nSource: X\nOn February 25, 2025, Litecoin made waves in the crypto community with the launch of its official “.ltc” domain extension, unveiled in partnership with Unstoppable Domains. This innovative feature mirrors Ethereum’s popular .eth domains and aims to transform user experience by enabling the registration of personalized, blockchain-based addresses, which simplifies transactions and minimizes errors associated with long alphanumeric wallet addresses.\nThe market has responded robustly—LTC’s price witnessed a nearly 22% surge since the announcement, underscoring investor confidence in this strategic enhancement.\nPolymarket Anticipates 75% Likelihood of Litecoin ETF Approval\nLitecoin ETF approval likelihood crosses 76% on Polymarket | Source: Polymarket\nAdding another layer of bullish sentiment, optimism around a potential Litecoin ETF has been intensifying among both institutional and retail investors. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst recently indicated a 90% likelihood of a Litecoin-based ETF approval in 2025, and betting platforms like Polymarket have priced the odds at around 76% by the end of the year.\nWith regulatory nods already emerging—evidenced by the US Securities and Exchange Commission acknowledging CoinShares’ spot Litecoin ETF filings—the anticipation of an ETF approval is seen as a key catalyst that could significantly boost liquidity and open the door to a broader range of investors entering the Litecoin market.\nLTC Traders Anticipate Bullish Breakout Above $130\nLTC/USDT price chart | Source: KuCoin\nLitecoin’s price action over the past days has been characterized by a V-shaped recovery—bouncing from lows around $106 to current levels above $131. Open interest trends and rising whale accumulation underscore the renewed trader confidence, even as the broader crypto market faces a challenging sell-off. Indicators like the 4-hour RSI climbing into bullish territory further support the notion that LTC’s asymmetric rally could be gaining momentum.\nTechnical charts reveal that Litecoin is nearing a classic inverse head and shoulders (IH&S) pattern, a bullish reversal formation. Traders are watching for a decisive breakout above the $130 neckline, which could propel the price toward a target of approximately $160 by March. Meanwhile, optimism surrounding a potential Litecoin ETF is high—with Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst suggesting a 90% likelihood of approval in 2025—further fueling bullish sentiment.\nLTC vs. BTC Performance: Litecoin’s Strength Against Bitcoin\nLitecoin’s relative performance against Bitcoin has been particularly notable this year. The LTC/BTC pair has surged by around 40% year-to-date, outperforming major competitors like Ethereum and Solana, which have seen significant declines against Bitcoin. This performance underlines Litecoin’s growing market dominance amid a broader market downturn.\nLTC Hashrate Cross 2.4 PH/s, Signals On-Chain Resilience and Miner Confidence\nLitecoin’s hashrate on the rise | Source: CoinWarz\nBeyond technical patterns and ETF buzz, Litecoin is showing robust network fundamentals. The hashrate recently hit an all-time high of 2.47 PH/s, signaling heightened miner confidence and increased network security. Additionally, on-chain data indicates that miners are accumulating LTC and reducing selling pressure, setting the stage for a potential supply squeeze.\nRead more: How to Mine Litecoins: The Ultimate Guide to Litecoin Mining\nLitecoin’s Future Outlook and Risks\nWhile the bullish indicators are strong, Litecoin’s upward momentum depends on sustaining the breakout above key technical resistance levels. A failure to maintain levels above $130 could trigger a retest of support near $123.80 and $120.41. However, with solid network fundamentals, rising trader interest, and ETF optimism, LTC appears well-positioned for a potential rally in the coming months.\nLitecoin’s multifaceted strengths—from innovative domain solutions to technical and on-chain resilience—continue to set it apart in a volatile crypto landscape, positioning it as a promising asset as the market evolves.",
