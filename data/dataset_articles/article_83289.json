  "text": "It is highly unusual for a drug that has not yet received regulatory approval to be recommended for prescription in clinical settings.\nThe guideline classifies the clinical evidence supporting Rivoceranib + Camrelizumab as “Level of Evidence I,” the highest rating. It strongly recommends this combination as a first-line treatment for liver cancer patients with relatively preserved liver function.\nAdditionally, the guideline also recommends other first-line therapies, including Bevacizumab + Atezolizumab and Durvalumab + Tremelimumab. However, it specifies that patients with a history or risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding undergoing Bevacizumab-based therapy must undergo screening procedures beforehand. This reflects the necessity of conducting endoscopic examinations before prescribing Bevacizumab due to its high risk of causing GI bleeding.\nHan Yong-hae, chief technology officer of HLB Group, stated “With regulatory approval imminent, ESMO’s strong recommendation for Rivoceranib + Camrelizumab as a first-line liver cancer treatment signifies that HLB’s therapy has been internationally recognized as a standard treatment. This is a positive signal not only for obtaining EMA and FDA approvals but also for its inclusion in the NCCN guidelines.”",
