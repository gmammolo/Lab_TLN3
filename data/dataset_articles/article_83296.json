This includes Screen Time, Find My, Communication Saftey, Communication Limits, and more.\nOver this year, Apple is introducing new features to build on its commitment to user privacy, security, and safety for children:\nMake it even easier for parents to set up Child Accounts that underlie many of our parental controls.\nPut parents in control by allowing them to share information about the age range of their kids with apps to enable developers to provide only age-appropriate content, all without needing to share their birthdate or other sensitive information.\nAnd further enhance parents' insight and control over their kids' experiences by updating our age ratings, adding more useful information on product pages, and making browsing safer on the App Store.\nChild Accounts\nFirst, Apple is building on its Child Accounts feature with several key improvements.
