  "text": "Genetic study reveals how extreme heat can accelerate ageing in older adults\nMPost28 Feb 2025 12:27 AM IST\nMPost28 Feb 2025 12:27 AM IST\nNew Delhi: A genetic study has shown how exposure to extreme heat can alter the way genes express themselves, and potentially accelerate ageing among older adults.\nExtreme heat has been linked to negative health outcomes, including heart disease and increased mortality. However, its impact on biological ageing remains unclear, researchers at the University of Southern California, US, said.\nPeople living in neighbourhoods experiencing more days of high heat show greater biological ageing on an average than residents of cooler regions, senior author Jennifer Ailshire, a professor of gerontology and sociology at the University of Southern California, said.\n“It’s really about the combination of heat and humidity, particularly for older adults, because older adults don’t sweat the same way. We start to lose our ability to have the skin-cooling effect that comes from that evaporation of sweat,” she explained.\nBiological age reflects the body’s functioning at the molecular, cellular, and organ levels. A higher biological age relative to chronological age (based on birth date) is considered a risk factor for various health conditions.\nThe study, published in the journal Science Advances, analysed blood samples from more than 3,600 adults aged 56 and above, over a six-year study period from 2010 to 2016.\nThe team analysed the samples for the way genes are turned ‘on’ or ‘off’ by a common epigenetic process called DNA methylation. An epigenetic process is how information stored in a gene gets translated into observable behaviour.\nPatterns in DNA methylation helped the researchers estimate the participants’ biological ages at each time point, changes in which were compared with their location’s history of heat index and heat days, as reported by the US’ National Weather Service.\n“Participants living in areas where heat days, as defined as ‘Extreme Caution’ or higher levels (over 32 degrees Celsius), occur half the year, such as Phoenix (in the state of) Arizona, experienced up to 14 months of additional biological ageing compared to those living in areas with fewer than 10 heat days per year,” co-author Eunyoung Choi, a postdoctoral scholar at the university said.\nThe link between extreme heat exposure and accelerated ageing remained significant regardless of socioeconomic and demographic differences, as well as lifestyle factors like physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking, the researchers said.\n“Just because you live in an area with more heat days, you’re aging faster biologically,” Choi said.\nThe authors wrote, “We demonstrated that short, mid, and long-term ambient outdoor heat can significantly accelerate epigenetic aging within a diverse, nationally representative cohort of older adults.”",
