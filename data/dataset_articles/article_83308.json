  "text": "Soon, it is expected that Samsung launches its new accessible tablet model: the Galaxy Tab S10 Fe. At this stage, the official information is scarce, but we will already know some leaks about what to expect from this new tablet.\nHighlight for the “jump” on the screen and the RAM\nIt should be noted that the series should come out with two different models: the Galaxy Tab S10 Fe and the Galaxy Tab S10 Fe+. Two of the main improvements to be felt in this Samsung series have to do with the screen, RAM and storage capacity.\nAs explained by Notebook Checkthe standard version screen should keep the 10.9 inches of the previous version. The S10 Fe+ model, on the other hand, should jump from the 12.4 S9 Fe+ to 13.1 inches.\nIn this way, as the same source of information refers, the “S10 Fe+” version will be higher than the Galaxy Tab S10+, which has a 12.4 inch screen. It remains to be clarified if the screens will be AMOLED or LCD.\nIn terms of memory, the international press has advanced that the RAM could rise up to 12 GB of RAM and storage up to 256 GB.\nOther possibilities for the Galaxy Tab S10 Fe\nIn addition to the previously mentioned aspects, it is estimated that the Galaxy Tab S10 Fe can be powered by an Exynos 1580 processor. To add to this, it is expected to have an optional pen, 5G IP68 resistance against water and dust.\nAs Aroged previously reported, Samsung has published a teaser about the upcoming mobile phones. This is presumably the A26, A36 and A56, where they will go from 4 years of updates to the age of 6. It wouldn’t be strange that with the Galaxy Tab S10 Fe happen the same thing.\nOnce again, it is never too much to reinforce that the data is not yet made official by Samsung. Until the launch happens, you can always find for sale, in Amazon Spain, the previous generation.",
