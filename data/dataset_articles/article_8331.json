  "text": "YUMA, AZ (AZFamily) — A Southern Arizona woman is thanking the community after a fire ravaged the Extended Hands Thrift Store in Yuma over the weekend. The fire was caught on security cameras. It showed the thrift store’s backyard fully engulfed in flames. Thankfully, firefighters stopped the fire before it reached the main storefront. But the fire destroyed all donated goods stored in storage units. “When I looked out to the yard, I said, all the inventory is gone. We have nothing. Everything is smoke damaged,” said Sherry Whitworth, the store’s owner. Whitworth opened the store over a decade ago, which helps veterans, underserved people and active military. Whitworth said their most important mission is to help active military members and their families. Every year, a dinner is held to help provide free bicycles to military families’ children and offer vouchers for the thrift store. Since the fire destroyed all their donated bikes, it jeopardized the dinner. But now, the community is stepping up to keep the tradition going. In total, more than a dozen bikes have been donated. “I just know how happy the kids are and excited when they get them,” she said. “With what the community is doing, we almost doubled the bicycles we had,” Sherry hopes to be back open by September, but until then, she is thanking the community. “Amazing, we love you, we love serving you and we’re so grateful that you’re loving us back right now,” she said.
