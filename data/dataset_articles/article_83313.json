So, how does Roamless stack up in terms of price, coverage, and overall experience? Let’s break it down.\n1. Pricing While Roamless offers flexibility and affordable data rates, it doesn’t include unlimited data options . For example, their eSIM for Lisbon looks like this:\n1 GB for $2.45 2 GB for $4.90 3 GB for $7.35 5 GB for $12.25 And 10 GB for $24.50 You only pay for the data you use , so you don’t have to worry about expiration dates. And if you need more data, simply add funds to your Roamless wallet to purchase additional data.\nRoamless eSIM for USA is available in preset fixed-data plans. Source: Roamless 2. Network coverage and quality Roamless offers eSIMs in 187 destinations, connecting to many major eSIM carriers for broader coverage.\nIn Lisbon, for example, it connects to MEO (5G) and NOS (5G), two of Portugal’s major networks.\nHowever, like all eSIM providers, the experience depends on the carrier’s network quality in specific locations. If you’re traveling to remote or rural areas, coverage may vary.\nRoamless offers eSIM across 187 destinations. Source: Roamless 🛜 Not sure how much data you need?

Customer service and technical support Roamless offers support through their troubleshooting FAQs and a feedback form users can fill in on the website and app.\nHowever, it doesn’t feature chatbots, call centers, or other direct support channels. This can have a say on response times and customer satisfaction. Roamless’ 3.3-star rating on Google Play Store is impacted by some reviews that address slow customer service response times.\n4. Roamless app review Roamless offers a dedicated app for iOS and Android. The app allows users to purchase and add funds to their eSIM via credit or debit card, which are converted into GB of data.\nAvailable top-up options include $5, $10, $20, and $50 , with the amount of data varying based on destination. Users can also purchase call credits in the app.\neSIM activation is straightforward, with clear instructions provided. The app includes a data usage dashboard where users can track their usage for the current day, month, and previous month. However, detailed historical data is not available.\nFor support, users can submit a feedback form within the app, as there are no direct contact lines available .\nSome users had a positive experience, describing the installation process as “very easy and straightforward.”\nHowever, not everyone shares the same enthusiasm. Another user criticized the app for being “ very slow ” and plagued by “ too many forced updates .” He pointed out that even simple tasks like checking your balance often required yet another unnecessary update, making the app frustrating to use.\nRoamless mobile app. Source: Roamless 5. Roamless member program If you’re new to Roamless, you can kick things off with a nice little bonus. You’ll get $20 in credits for just $10.
