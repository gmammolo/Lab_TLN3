  "text": "As automotive technology continues to evolve, Nissan has become a front-runner in integrating advanced features into its vehicles.

Available in models such as the Nissan Rogue and Pathfinder, Intelligent AWD adjusts power between the front and rear wheels to enhance traction and stability.\nHow It Works : The system continuously monitors road conditions and can adjust the distribution of power to the wheels that need it most.
