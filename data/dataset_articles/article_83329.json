  "text": "Infinix has been preparing to unveil its latest mid-range smartphone lineup, the Note 50 series, and we now have a confirmed launch date. The highly anticipated Note 50 series will be released on March 3 in Indonesia as a successor to the Note 40 series that was released last year.\nThe smartphone maker officially announced the launch date through a teaser posted on their Instagram account . While Infinix hasn’t specified how many models will be included in the lineup, industry sources suggest we could see multiple variants, including the Note 50X, Note 50, Note 50 Pro, and Note 50 Pro+ 5G.\nThe Infinix Note 50 Pro model has already appeared on Indonesia’s SDPPI certification website with the model number X6855, confirming at least one of the variants in the upcoming series.\nDesign and Specifications The teaser trailer provides a glimpse of one model’s camera module, revealing a triple camera setup on the rear. While complete specifications remain under wraps, an FCC listing has shared some details about the base Note 50 model. These include:\n9mm thickness NFC support Dual-band WiFi connectivity 45W wired fast charging capability AI Features Infinix has emphasized that the Note 50 series will come equipped with their AI technology, bringing useful AI-powered tools to users. Specific details about these AI features haven’t been disclosed yet, though rumor has it that Infinix has integrated DeepSeek-R1 into its voice assistant, Folax.\nHow Does the Note 50 Series Compare to the Note 40 Series? For comparison, last year’s Infinix Note 40 Pro 5G featured:\nA 6nm MediaTek Dimensity 7020 chip 5,000 mAh battery 6.78-inch curved 3D AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate 108-megapixel primary camera 32-megapixel selfie camera Whether the Note 50 series will build upon these specifications or introduce some bigger (and hopefully better) changes remains to be seen.\nPricing and global availability details have yet to be announced, but with the launch just days away, more information about the Infinix Note 50 series is expected to emerge soon.",
