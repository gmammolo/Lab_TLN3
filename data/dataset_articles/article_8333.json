  "text": "First heat-related deaths this year reported in Idaho [CHRISTINA LORDS / Idaho Capital Sun]() | June 21, 2024 2:30 PM The first two heat-related deaths in Idaho this year have been reported to the Division of Public Health. Both Idaho residents were over the age of 60, according to a press release Friday. “Please stay safe if you head outdoors this summer,” said Dr. Christine Hahn, Idaho public health medical director. “Stay hydrated, wear sunscreen and a hat with a brim, and be aware that even if it’s cool in the morning, temperatures can rise a lot during the day this time of year.” Temperatures this weekend are forecast to get close to 100 degrees in the southern areas of Idaho and in the 80s in North Idaho. Late June and early July usually ushers in the hot weather season in Idaho, and Idahoans should take precautions to ensure they stay safe, the release said. Anyone can get heat-related illness, but those at greater risk are young children, older adults and people who are overweight or have underlying health conditions or take certain medications that reduce the body’s ability to stay cool, the release said. Be aware of symptoms of heat-related illness and how to treat them The most serious type of heat-related illness is heatstroke, a medical emergency. Symptoms may include high body temperature, hot red skin, confusion or seizures, nausea, dizziness and fainting. If someone experiences these symptoms and cannot quickly get medical care, call 911 right away. Move to a cooler place and use cool wet cloths or ice on the head, neck, armpits and groin, or soak clothing with cool water or give a cool bath to help lower body temperature. Speed cooling with a fan. Do not give a person with heatstroke anything to drink, as they may not be able to swallow correctly and could inhale the fluid instead of swallowing it, the release said. Health officials recommend trying to stay cool on hot days by wearing lightweight, loose-fitting clothing; limit outdoor activity to the coolest hours of morning and evening; drink plenty of fluids; avoid alcohol and drinks with high caffeine or sugar and wear a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses and wear sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher.",
