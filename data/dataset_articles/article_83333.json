  "text": "VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESS Newswire / February 27, 2025 / Onco-Innovations Limited (CSE:ONCO)(OTCQB:ONNVF)(Frankfurt:W1H,WKN: A3EKSZ) (\"Onco\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide information regarding its wholly-owned subsidiary, Inka Health (\"Inka\"), which has made significant strides in advancing AI-driven oncology research by leading a transformative study protocol1 published in medRxiv in September 2024, focused on AI-generated synthetic patient models. This innovative research aims to advance the study of oncology by creating synthetic patient data, thereby leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to overcome critical challenges, particularly in the study of rare cancers where traditional patient data is often unavailable or difficult to obtain.\nThe study, entitled, \"External Control Arm with Synthetic Real-world Data for Comparative Oncology using Single Trial Arm Evidence (ECLIPSE): A Case Study using Lung-MAP S1400I\" is led by Dr. Winson Cheung, Medical Advisor at Inka Health and Professor of Medicine at the University of Calgary, and brought together an esteemed team of oncology experts, including Inka Health co-founders Dr. Paul Arora and Dr. Alind Gupta, along with a consortium of world-renowned cancer researchers and private sector partners (Subsalt and Quantify Health). This exciting initiative seeks to develop synthetic patient cohorts using AI technology, a core element of digital twin technology, to address gaps in oncology research and accelerate clinical trial design by quickly generating comparator arms for trials. The Company believes that this is particularly critical in the rare cancer setting where randomizing patients to control arms (comparison groups without the new treatment)2 is often infeasible. Ultimately, this approach aims to improve the pace and effectiveness of cancer treatments.",
