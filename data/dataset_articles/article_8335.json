  "text": "DANVILLE, Va. ( [WFXR](https://www.wfxrtv.com/))– Relief efforts provided by God’s Pit Crew are currently heading down to Roswell, New Mexico, to help the Ruidoso village impacted by a deadly wildfire outbreak. Over 7,000 members in the area were given an evacuation order on Monday, June 17, with the notice on the community’s website stating ‘GO NOW: Do not attempt to gather belongings or protect your home. Evacuate immediately.’ In response, God’s Pit Crew is sending a full semi-load of Blessing Buckets, which are five-gallon containing non-perishable food, water, hygiene items, first-aid kits, flashlights, Bibles, and handwritten notes of encouragement. The truck left God’s Pit Crew’s location in Danville on Thursday, June 20 and is traveling over 1,700 miles to New Mexico. The supplies will be distributed by officials in the area to anyone in need. “It’s heartbreaking to have so many people have to drop everything in an instant and leave behind all they have to escape the approaching fire,” remarked [Chris Chiles,](https://godspitcrew.org/our-team/) God’s Pit Crew Immediate Disaster Response Coordinator. “This is a horrible scene that is 0% contained at the moment.” God’s Pit Crew’s President, [Randy Johnson](https://godspitcrew.org/our-team/), says he hopes that these items will bring hope to the people of Ruidoso. “We are praying for everyone impacted by this devasting fire, and we pray that supplies our ministry is sending will bring needed relief in such a terrifying time,” said Johnson. So far in 2024, the non-profit organization has responded to 10 major disaster situations throughout the country and delivered 19 tractor-trailer loads of relief to disaster victims.
