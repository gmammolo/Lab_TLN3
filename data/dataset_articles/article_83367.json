  "text": "Commentary\nPodcast\nDr Bardia discusses the FDA approval of T-DXd for patients with unresectable or metastatic, hormone receptor–positive, HER2-low/-ultralow breast cancer.\nWelcome to OncLive On Air®!

In both digital and print formats, OncLive covers every angle of oncology practice, from new technology to treatment advances to important regulatory decisions.\nIn today’s episode, we had the pleasure of speaking with Aditya Bardia, MD, MPH, FASCO, about the FDA approval of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd; Enhertu) for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic, hormone receptor–positive, HER2-low or -ultralow breast cancer, as determined by an FDA-approved test, that has progressed on at least 1 endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting. Dr Bardia serves as a professor in the Department of Medicine in the Division of Hematology/Oncology and is the director of Translational Research Integration at the UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.\nIn our exclusive interview, Dr Bardia discussed the significance of this approval, findings from the pivotal DESTINY-Breast06 trial (NCT04494425), and what this new indication for T-DXd means for the future of HER2 testing in breast cancer.\n___\nThat’s all we have for today!
