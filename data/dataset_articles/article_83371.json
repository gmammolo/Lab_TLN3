  "text": "HiMod Advanced Composite Bearing Plus. Photo Credit: Trelleborg Sealing Solutions\nTrelleborg Sealing Solutions (Trelleborg, Sweden) launches its latest lightweight thermoplastic composite bearing, the HiMod Advanced Composite Bearing Plus , an enhanced dual-layer bearing with a low-friction modified polyetheretherketone (PEEK) layer that reduces friction and increases wear performance for use in bearing, wear ring and bushing applications.\nManufactured using Trelleborg’s patented automated fiber placement (AFP) technology, a thin low-friction liner is bonded to the inner diameters and can be added to the outer diameters of the bearing to create a high-quality solution for use in a wide range of industries. According to the company, HiMod Advanced Composite Bearing Plus will not seize or gall, unlike metal bearings, to reduce the likelihood of pump damage in chemical processing applications, has a low coefficient of friction and can withstand extreme temperature ranges.",
