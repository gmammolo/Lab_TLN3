  "text": "The University of Michigan (U-M), renowned for its rich legacy in transportation safety research, is embarking on a significant initiative to merge its expertise in connected and automated vehicle technologies with a renewed focus on saving lives. This endeavor marks a notable expansion of the University’s Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) as it incorporates the Mcity public/private partnership and test facility. Effective from March 1, this organizational shift is positioned to transform the landscape of mobility technology research and testing, enhancing safety measures for the future of transportation.\nAt the helm of this transformative expansion is Henry Liu, who has been leading Mcity since 2022. Liu, a distinguished professor of civil and environmental engineering, articulates the potential this merger holds for amplifying the impact of their work. He emphasizes that while UMTRI contributes invaluable research focused on safety, Mcity’s unique testing capabilities will complement this by facilitating the development of cutting-edge technologies. This collaborative approach is designed to extend beyond engineering advancements, addressing the societal impacts and human factors associated with transportation innovations.\nThe transition is significant not only because it brings a synergistic approach to transportation safety but also because it brings together the historical legacies of UMTRI and Mcity. UMTRI, recognized for launching substantial safety research initiatives, will be guided by Liu, succeeding James Sayer, who has led the institute for nearly a decade. Under Sayer’s leadership, the institute has made considerable strides in reducing roadway fatalities, correlating its research with real-world vehicle safety developments.\nMcity, established in 2015 as the world’s inaugural purpose-built test track for connected and automated vehicles, represents a substantial investment in the future of transportation safety. The collaboration that produced this facility illustrates a commitment from academia, industry giants, and government bodies to reshape the way vehicles are tested in increasingly complex urban environments. Sayer’s assertion that their trajectory in road safety has now come full circle underscores the urgent need to reevaluate strategies in light of the staggering number of fatalities occurring each year.\nDuring the 1960s, traffic fatalities surged alarmingly as vehicle ownership rose and cars became faster and more powerful. In response, a consortium of federal agencies and automotive manufacturers, including Ford and GM, established UMTRI’s predecessor to specifically address traffic safety concerns. Over the years, the institute’s research has been pivotal in achieving a 35% estimated decrease in roadway fatalities per capita, which underlines the effectiveness of early safety innovations and ongoing research.\nAs automakers accelerate their focus on connected and automated technologies, UMTRI’s methodologies for crash analysis and safety research have attracted significant attention. This includes pioneering efforts in connected vehicle deployments that collectively encompassed millions of miles driven by thousands of participants. These studies have provided invaluable insights into how technology can substantially mitigate the risks posed by impaired and distracted driving.\nAmong the notable advancements initiated at UMTRI are developments in crash test dummy technology and occupant safety systems. During the 1970s, enhancements to the realism of crash test dummies facilitated a deeper understanding of human physiology and safety needs in vehicle design. This research has had enduring impacts, serving as foundational elements for vehicle safety systems like airbags, child safety seats, and seatbelt technologies.\nUMTRI’s research extended into discomforting statistics around roadway safety in the early 1990s, prompting researchers to introduce an array of data-driven solutions. Notably, their investigations culminated in the establishment of the International Roughness Index, which has become vital for evaluating road quality and safety. By ensuring that vehicles are optimized not only for performance but also for safety in diverse environments, UMTRI has laid the groundwork for safer roads globally.\nAs the industry continues to pivot toward automation, the recent focus on connected vehicle data in real-world settings has become pivotal. UMTRI’s partnership with federal transport agencies to implement large-scale connected vehicle deployments demonstrates a proactive approach to integrating technology into safety protocols. The earlier Safety Pilot Model Deployment revealed the potential for connected vehicles to decrease unimpaired crashes by an astounding 80%, setting the stage for further enhancements in safety protocols.\nMcity’s test facility is an exemplar of a proactive approach to developing automated technologies. Encompassing 32 acres designed to simulate urban and suburban environments, the facility affords researchers and manufacturers a controlled environment to rigorously test and validate new mobility technologies. This testing mechanism not only provides safety assurances but also creates a benchmark for the deployment of emerging automated systems that prioritize user safety.\nThe current intersection of UMTRI and Mcity signifies an unprecedented leap towards comprehensively addressing the challenges of road safety. Liu’s outlook suggests that innovative automation is crucial in significantly reducing roadway fatalities. Thus, the collaboration seeks to focus not solely on the technological enhancement of vehicles but also on evolving safety designs to protect occupants in an automated context, considering factors like seating positions and safety restraints.\nAs the landscape of transportation evolves, U-M’s Transportation Research Institute and Mcity are reaching a pivotal moment framed by an escalating public safety crisis. Each year, more than 40,000 individuals lose their lives on U.S. roads, compelling a collective reevaluation of safety strategies. Current governmental frameworks are recognizing this epidemic and advocating for the integration of automated technologies as part of a comprehensive solution. The need for collaborative and systemic approaches to transportation safety cannot be overstated, highlighting the importance of research that not only innovates but also informs policy and practice in a rapidly changing landscape.\nIn conclusion, U-M’s emphasis on merging the strengths of UMTRI and Mcity illustrates a forward-thinking approach to developing safer transportation solutions. As researchers navigate the complexities of integrating automated technologies into everyday driving, their focus remains steadfast on creating an environment that prioritizes safety and well-being. By fostering partnerships within the education, industry, and government sectors, U-M is poised to drive the future of transportation safety into previously uncharted territories.\nSubject of Research : Integration of Transportation Safety Research and Automated Vehicle Technologies\nArticle Title : The Future of Safe Transportation: University of Michigan Integrates UMTRI and Mcity\nNews Publication Date : March 1, 2023\nWeb References : https://www.umtri.umich.edu, https://mcity.umich.edu\nReferences : National Safety Council, 2023 NRC data, U.S. Department of Transportation\nImage Credits : University of Michigan\nKeywords",
