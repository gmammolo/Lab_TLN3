  "text": "Unveiling Mars’ Watery Past: A New Perspective For many years, scientists studying Mars have suspected the presence of water on the planet, a theory supported by images captured by NASA’s “Mariner 9” mission in the 1970s, which revealed dry channels. Despite this, debates have persisted regarding the nature and longevity of this water.\nWhile some climate models suggest that any surface water on Mars was quickly frozen under ice caps, recent findings published in Science Advances on January 15 offer a contrasting narrative.\nImages from NASA’s Curiosity rover have uncovered formations known as “wave ripples,” resembling small hills found at the bottom of lakes on Earth. This discovery suggests that liquid water once flowed on Mars’ surface,exposed too the atmosphere.\nThese intriguing formations were discovered in a basin within Gale Crater , an area explored by the Curiosity rover as August 2012.\n“Wave ripples form exclusively under open water influenced by wind,” explains Claire M. de Leeuw, a sedimentologist at Caltech and lead author of the study.\nBy examining the height and spacing of these ripples, scientists estimated the size of the ancient lake. The ripples, standing about 6 mm tall and spaced 4 to 5 cm apart, indicate they formed in shallow lakes no deeper than two meters.\nThese dry lake beds are estimated to be around 3.7 billion years old, suggesting Mars once had a dense, warm atmosphere capable of sustaining liquid water for extended periods, longer than previously believed.\nThis revelation has significant implications, as de Leeuw notes: “Increased evidence of liquid water raises the possibility that Mars could have supported microbial life in it’s past.”\nThus, the potential for life to have developed on Mars may have been greater than once thought.\nOver billions of years, Mars lost much of its atmosphere and surface water. Scientists attribute this to the planet’s loss of its magnetic field, leaving it vulnerable to solar radiation. The intense solar wind stripped away much of the Martian atmosphere, causing carbon dioxide and water to evaporate into space, resulting in the icy desert landscape we see today.\nsource: Live Science\nmarkdown\nNew Tests That Support the Possibility of Life on Mars\nThe age-old question of whether humans are alone in the universe has long captured the creativity of scientists and dreamers alike. In recent years, advancements in space technology and research have brought us closer to answering this profound question, especially through new tests and findings on Mars.
