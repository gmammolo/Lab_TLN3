  "text": "The BYD Shark 6 dual-cab ute is a five-star car, according to the Australasian New Car Assessment program (ANCAP).\nThe plug-in hybrid workhorse performed strongly in physical crash tests and has plenty of active driver aids and its maximum five-star rating matches its more established, and top selling, rivals.\nIt received a solid 85 per cent score for adult occupant protection, which is better than the Ford Ranger (84 per cent) but lower than the Mitsubishi Triton (86 per cent) and Toyota HiLux (96 per cent).\nIt was marked down as ANCAP deemed the driver chest and neck protection just adequate during some crash tests for the driver and adequate for rear passenger’s neck and just marginal for chest protection.\nIt scored a whopping 95 per cent in the child occupant protection field, which beats its rivals the Toyota HiLux (87 per cent), Mitsubishi Triton (89 per cent) and Ford Ranger (93 per cent)\nANCAP boss Carla Hoorweg said the top score continued BYD’s run of five star cars and showed new brands were putting safety first.\n“With five of BYD’s current local models having now earned top ANCAP safety ratings, it's evident that new manufacturers are prioritising safety as they enter the market to align with consumer demands,” said Ms Hoorweg.\n“Following the recently rated GWM Cannon Alpha hybrid ute, we expect to see an increase in electrified options in the utility space. And so far, they’re meeting the mark.”\nThe BYD Shark has made waves in Australia, it has beat big name players such as Ford, Toyota and Mitsubishi to market with a plug-in hybrid ute.\nBYD didn’t report official sales data last month for the Shark 6, but the brand said it already held between 5000 and 6000 orders for the vehicle, and said it expects to add in excess of 10,000 sales before the end of 2025.\n\"We're very happy with where Shark is, this month [February] will be a record month,\" said CEO of BYD importer EVDirect, David Smitherman, to CarsGuide.\n\"The ultimate way to validate anything is the scoreboard. It's going to be north of 15,000 (sales this year).\"\nFord has confirmed a plug-in hybrid Ranger ute is headed here this year, but no official word from Toyota or Mitsubishi yet.",
