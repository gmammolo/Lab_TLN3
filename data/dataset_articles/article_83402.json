  "text": "Kick-off at Sony of a new luminous great angle and with a fixed focal length: the FE 16 mm f/1.8 G. Compact, this objective is aimed at the photo of architecture, landscape, vloggers, or lovers of stylized portraits.\nA huge 400-800 mm zoom on one side; A large 16 mm compact angle of the other. In terms of full -format objectives, Sony is doing eclecticism this week. And since we have already talked about the promising FE 400-800mm F6.3-8 G OSS, let’s now dwell on the new FE 16 mm f/1.8 G.\nTo go further\nPhoto lenses: Understanding everything about the different optics for your camera\nAlso unveiled on the occasion of the CP+ 2025 show, underlines Phototrendthis new fixed focal length optics are housed between the FE 14 mm f/1.8 GM models and 20 mm f/1.8 g already available at Sony, with the particularity of offering sufficiently collected dimensions (73.8 x 75 mm and 304 grams) to elegantly mount on one of the full compact formats of the brand, such as the Alpha 7C II, for example.\nA condensed format that does not prevent the inclusion of several manual commands, including a focusing ring, a diaphragm control ring, an AF / MF switch, a configurable button, and an iris locking latch.\nA new goal expected in spring\nOn the optical level, this new FE 16 mm f/1.8 g has 15 elements (including 1 Super ED glass, 3 ED glasses as well as 3 aspirial lenses) articulated in 12 groups.\nThese specifications are supposed to limit both chromatic aberration, but also focus breathing During video capture. The automatic focus is also supported by two XD linear motors (with a minimum distance from oscillating focus between 15 to 13 cm depending on the mode chosen), and as for the large opening to f/1.8, it is managed by a diaphragm with 11 strips.\nSource : Sony\nSource : Sony\nSource : Sony\nSource : Sony\nSony also explains that she worked to reduce the distortion inherent in his grand angle as much as possible, whether in JPEG or RAW, through automatically applied correction profiles in the case.\nNot stabilized, this new FE 16 mm f/1.8 g objective, on the other hand, offers resistance to dust and humidity, and is compatible with filters with a diameter of 67 mm. He will arrive on the market in April 2025, at a price set at 999 euros in France.\nEcperating guests and thrilling subjects! Our Unlock show is to find one Wednesday in two live, from 5 to 7 p.m. on Twitch. Also think of reruns on YouTube!\n(tagstotranslate) Objective",
