  "text": "Wake up, y'all. There's a new app in town. And yes, it's a little similar to Pokemon Go. Remember how the app had us all out on the streets and interacting with nature, albeit via our phones?\nThis new app called Touch Grass is making strides in the world of social media, especially for those who are too fidgety with their phones and are trying to ground themselves as much as possible.\nFor the unversed, all those who download this app will be blocked from accessing social media unless they go outside and scan a photo of themselves touching grass in the app. You then get the option of choosing which app you wish to unlock.\nFans have since begun reacting to this idea hilariously, and we've rounded up all of the best ones for you. Heads up, some of these are bound to leave you in splits.\nDisclaimer: This piece reflects the writer's opinion; the reader's discretion is advised.\nFans react to an app that forces you to go outside and touch some grass in order to access social media: Read more\nCheck out what one user hilariously, though scarily, pointed out:\n\"We are doomed..living in one of this weird sci-fi.\"\nThe comments didn't end there, though. Check out what the others are saying:\n\"What happens when you’re snowed out,\"[someone jokingly asked.]\n\"What kind of world are we living in where people need an application to remind them to go outside?\"[another hilariously probed.]\n\"We were supposed to have flying cars by now,\"[one X user humorously pointed out.]\n\"Definitely something that i don't need,\"[one more chimed in.]\nEven more chimed in with some funny comments, though scores online were seemingly in disbelief that we live in a world where we need an app to tell us we have to go outside for the day:\n\"What if you are in a bad neighborhood,\"[one user jokingly asked.]\n\"Was beginning to forget what that was,\"[someone else quipped.]\n\"I will plant a garden inside my room,\"[another creative user shared.]\n\"Does Minecraft grass count?\"[an X user asked, albeit satirically.]\nOne user had a creative solution to a creative problem:\nYet another posed a question about the state of affairs once if it was winter, though they also had a humorous GIF to go with it:\nDownload the app and let us know what you think!\nYour perspective matters!\nStart the conversation",
