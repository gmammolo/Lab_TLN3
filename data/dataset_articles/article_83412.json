  "text": "Kia has detailed the PV5 EV, ahead of its launch in the second half of the year. It offers 43.3, 51.5, and 71.2 kWh battery packs and has a range of up to 249 miles. A dizzying array of configurations will be available, but all have a 161 hp motor. Following a preview earlier this month, Kia has released details and initial specifications for their new PV5 van. It’s the first member of their Platform Beyond Vehicle lineup and will be offered in passenger, cargo, and chassis cab configurations.\nStarting with the PV5 Passenger, it features three-rows of seats and can seamlessly transition between personal and business use. Kia also noted they worked closely with Uber to address customer pain points and this means the van will be “able to serve multiple use cases for riders and should be eligible for multiple Uber product categories.”\nMore: 2026 Kia EV4 Arrives To Take On The Tesla Model 3 And VW ID.3\nThe PV5 Cargo will be offered in Standard, Long, and High-Roof configurations that offer up to 180.1 cubic feet (5,100 liters) of cargo space. The Standard and Long variants have two front seats, although a third seat is available. The model also offers an optional L-track mounting system for the cargo area.\nThe PV5 Chassis Cab is based on the PV5 Cargo, but comes “supplied as an incomplete vehicle.” Kia said it’s envisioned to be transformed into everything from a drop side truck to a refrigerated van.\nIn terms of size, the Passenger and Cargo Long variants measure 184.8 inches (4,695 mm) long and have a 117.9-inch (2,995 mm) wheelbase. This makes the vans 10.6 inches (269 mm) shorter than the US-spec Volkswagen ID.Buzz , but only 0.7 inches (18 mm) smaller than the short wheelbase version offered in Europe.\nA Minimalist And Flexible Interior\nGiven that the PV5 is designed for business, it shouldn’t be surprising that the cabin is about as exciting as watching paint dry. There’s a minimalist dashboard with a 7-inch digital instrument cluster and a 12.9-inch infotainment system running Android Automotive OS. They’re joined by a pillar-like center stack as well as a two-spoke steering wheel with a column-mounted shifter.\nWhile the interior isn’t visually interesting, it offers extensive customization. As part of this effort, there are AddGear modular accessories that “resemble tailored furniture.” There are also a host of options and passenger-focused models offer multiple storage compartments as well as heated second-row seats.\nA New Platform With Multiple Batteries\nThe PV5 rides on the Electric-Global Modular Platform for Service (E-GMP.S), which builds on the existing E-GMP architecture . However, it’s more fleet focused and standardizes essential components – such as batteries and motors – to reduce costs and streamline development.\nFurthermore, E-GMP.S is an electric skateboard platform. This allows for “diverse upper body designs to be integrated into a flat base.” Speaking of which, Kia has developed a Flexible Body System that allows for Passenger, Cargo, Chassis-Cab, Wheelchair Accessible, and Family vehicles as well as Crew, Drop Side, Box Van, Freezer Box, Prime, and Light Camper configurations.\nThe PV5 will be offered with a 43.3 kWh LFP battery pack as well as 51.5 and 71.2 kWh NCM batteries. With the latter, the PV5 Passenger has a range of up to 249 miles (400 km) under the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure. When it comes time to charge, a 30 minute stop can take the battery from 10% to 80%.\nAll models appear to be powered by a front-mounted motor developing 161 hp (120 kW / 163 PS) and 184 lb-ft (250 Nm) of torque. However, we can expect to learn more details closer to launch.\nThe PV5 will go on sale in Europe and South Korea in the second half of the year. The van will then arrive in “other markets” in 2026.",
