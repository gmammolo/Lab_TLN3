By bringing the HCAd gene therapy platform fully in-house, Pacira gains complete control over its development pipeline while avoiding the\nThis transaction accelerates Pacira's \"5x30\" strategic transformation from a specialty pharmaceutical company into an innovation-driven biopharmaceutical organization. The HCAd platform's ability to deliver large and multiple gene constructs locally represents a technological differentiator in the competitive landscape of non-opioid pain management, potentially addressing root causes rather than symptoms.\nWith chronic pain affecting\nWhile the transaction appears strategically sound, investors should monitor integration progress, R&D expense trajectory, and clinical development timelines as Pacira works to leverage this platform across multiple musculoskeletal indications and potential partnership opportunities outside its core focus.\nPacira's acquisition of GQ Bio's high-capacity adenoviral (HCAd) vector platform represents a technologically differentiated approach to genetic medicine delivery. Unlike conventional adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to ~4.7kb of genetic cargo, HCAd vectors can accommodate up to 36kb of genetic material - allowing delivery of larger therapeutic genes or multiple gene constructs simultaneously, a critical advantage for addressing complex musculoskeletal conditions.\nThe platform's local delivery approach is particularly noteworthy for musculoskeletal applications. By administering genetic payloads directly to affected joints or tissues rather than systemically, this approach potentially mitigates the immunogenicity concerns that have challenged other gene therapy modalities. Local administration may also enable more precise dosing and reduce off-target effects, addressing key safety hurdles that have slowed adoption of genetic medicines.\nPCRX-201's advancement to Phase 2 trials for osteoarthritis represents an important clinical validation milestone. The candidate likely delivers therapeutic genes that modulate inflammatory pathways or stimulate cartilage regeneration - addressing disease biology rather than merely masking symptoms as current treatments do.\nFrom a manufacturing perspective, the HCAd platform could offer scalability advantages over other gene therapy vectors. Adenoviral vectors typically yield higher titers in production systems compared to AAV, potentially reducing manufacturing costs and improving commercial viability.\nThe acquisition positions Pacira competitively against other companies exploring genetic approaches to musculoskeletal conditions, including Flexion Therapeutics (acquired by Pacira in 2021), Bone Therapeutics, and Kolon TissueGene. The full integration of this platform gives Pacira end-to-end control over development, potentially accelerating timelines while reducing dependency on external technology partners.\nWhile promising, investors should recognize the regulatory complexities associated with gene therapy products. Pacira will need to address potential concerns about long-term safety, durability of effect, and manufacturing consistency as programs advance through clinical development.\n-- Advances Pacira’s “5x30” path to becoming an innovative biopharmaceutical organization --\n-- Adds novel, high-capacity, local-delivery platform for the development of genetic medicines with disease-modifying potential for prevalent musculoskeletal diseases with significant unmet needs --\n-- Brings preclinical portfolio and research and development talent --\n-- Provides expected near-term and long-term financial benefits with elimination of future milestone payments --\nPARSIPPANY, N.J., Feb. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pacira BioSciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: PCRX), the industry leader in its commitment to deliver innovative, non-opioid pain therapies to transform the lives of patients, today announced it has acquired the remaining 81 percent equity stake of GQ Bio Therapeutics GmbH for approximately\nGQ Bio is a privately held biopharmaceutical company with a novel, high-capacity, local-delivery platform that makes genetic medicines more efficient and enables the use of large and multiple gene constructs. GQ Bio also brings to Pacira a preclinical portfolio of assets with disease-modifying potential in prevalent musculoskeletal diseases, and research and development talent.\n“We are confident that this transaction will enhance our ability to address unmet patient needs, while building on our 5x30 plan to transition into an innovative biopharmaceutical organization,” said Frank D. Lee, chief executive officer of Pacira. “We have seen GQ Bio’s platform generate encouraging clinical data with PCRX-201 in osteoarthritis, underscoring the potential of this novel platform.”\n“Beyond the lead indication in osteoarthritis, we believe the HCAd platform has great potential to solidify Pacira as a leading developer of new treatments for musculoskeletal pain and adjacencies by addressing the underlying cause of chronic pain using a targeted molecular approach. With nearly 1 in 4 Americans currently suffering from chronic pain, there is a critical need to address this national epidemic. Additionally, we see great potential for partnering in areas outside of our therapeutic focus to extend the HCAd platform into other conditions of high unmet need where local administration of a genetic medicine is warranted,” continued Mr. Lee.\nTransaction Details\nPacira intends to maintain GQ Bio’s operations and invest in its HCAd gene therapy vector platform and innovative products built on the platform, leveraging Pacira’s clinical, regulatory and commercial capabilities.\nThe transaction provides Pacira with substantial expected financial benefits by eliminating its obligations for up to\nAbout the HCAd Platform\nGQ Bio’s HCAd vector platform solves many of the challenges in the field of genetic medicine that have prevented its utilization in treating common diseases like osteoarthritis. Key features include:\n- The HCAd vector is much more efficient at delivering genes into cells compared to many other gene therapies that rely on adenovirus associated virus, or AAV, vectors. As a result, the desired effect can be achieved with much smaller doses.\n- The vector used in the HCAd platform can carry up to 30,000 base pairs of DNA, which enables gene therapy with multiple or larger genes compared to AAV vectors.\n- Genetic medicines based on the HCAd platform can be administered locally and have the potential for redosing at therapeutically appropriate intervals.\n- Lower dose levels and efficient delivery of genes into cells means that thousands of doses can be produced in a single batch. As a result, therapies built on the HCAd platform are expected to have a commercially attractive and viable cost of goods profile.\nAbout the HCAd Pipeline\nPacira’s novel product candidate PCRX-201 (enekinragene inzadenovec), originally developed by GQ Bio, features an innovative HCAd-based design. PCRX-201 is in clinical development for osteoarthritis of the knee. PCRX-201 is injected locally into the knee joint to boost cellular production of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and block IL-1 pathway activation, significantly reducing chronic inflammation. PCRX-201’s unique design also features an inflammation-responsive promoter to only produce IL-1Ra when needed, mimicking how the body naturally responds to inflammation.\nAt the American College of Rheumatology meeting in November 2024, Pacira reported promising data from a large Phase 1 study in which PCRX-201 provided sustained improvements in knee pain, stiffness, and function through two years following local administration, with a well-tolerated safety profile. The Company is preparing to initiate a randomized, double-blind Phase 2 study of PCRX-201 for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee which recently opened for enrollment.\nIn addition to preclinical product candidates based on the HCAd vector platform, the two companies have identified numerous well-validated cytokines that could be the basis for additional locally administered genetic therapies using the HCAd platform.\nAbout Pacira\nPacira delivers innovative, non-opioid pain therapies to transform the lives of patients. Pacira has three commercial-stage non-opioid treatments: EXPAREL® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension), a long-acting local analgesic currently approved for infiltration, fascial plane block, and as an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block, an adductor canal nerve block, and a sciatic nerve block in the popliteal fossa for postsurgical pain management; ZILRETTA® (triamcinolone acetonide extended-release injectable suspension), an extended-release, intra-articular injection indicated for the management of osteoarthritis knee pain; and iovera®º, a novel, handheld device for delivering immediate, long-acting, drug-free pain control using precise, controlled doses of cold temperature to a targeted nerve.
