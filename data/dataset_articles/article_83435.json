  "text": "The PS3 emulation on Android could soon get the surprise of a new RPCS3 port, aPS3e.\nWhile this is not the first attempt at bringing RPCS3 to Android—an earlier port was developed by the creator of the Nintendo Switch emulator Sudachi—another, more credible developer is now working on a fresh port.\nNamed simply RPCS3-Android, this project is spearheaded by DH, one of the original founders of the RPCS3 emulator. (via Android Authority )\nDH played a crucial role in the emulator’s early development, co-founding the project in 2011 and laying the groundwork for the most advanced PS3 emulator available.\nHowever, they departed in 2016 to focus on RPCSX, a PlayStation 4 emulator. Since DH’s departure, RPCS3 has continued to evolve under a team of dedicated full-time and part-time developers.\nNew PS3 emulator from RPCS3 for Android could be in the works Interestingly, the current RPCS3 development team has previously expressed little interest in creating an Android version of the emulator. Their reluctance stems from the toxicity within the Android emulation community.\nDespite this stance, an ARM version of RPCS3 was officially released in December of last year.\nThis development has now paved the way for DH’s new project, which is expected to deliver a more stable and legitimate PS3 emulation experience than its predecessors.\nThe arrival of RPCS3-Android is particularly notable given the controversy surrounding aPS3e, which was built on stolen code and violated multiple open-source licenses.\nDespite gaining attention, the aPS3e project ultimately faced backlash after its developer was caught soliciting donations for work that largely consisted of repurposed code from the RPCS3 ARM build.\nConsequently, GitHub removed aPS3e’s repository, and its credibility within the emulation community has suffered.\nCurrently, RPCS3-Android is still in early development, and a finished build is not yet available. It may take weeks or even months before the emulator is usable.\nHowever, with a respected and knowledgeable developer leading the effort, reliable PS3 emulation on Android could finally become a reality in 2025.\nAre you looking forward to this emulator?
