  "text": "\"Its track record is characterised by constantly adapting to market demands and a firm commitment to technological innovation\"\nZeatz revolutionises industry with precision systems for aeronautics, energy and machinery with the help of TECNALIA\nZeatz, a company founded in 1962 in Itziar, Gipuzkoa, has evolved from a manufacturer of universal dividing heads to become a benchmark in customised solutions for sectors such as machine tools, capital goods, aeronautics and energy. Its track record is characterised by constantly adapting to market demands and a firm commitment to technological innovation.\nAccording to Edgar Oria, CEO of Zeatz, \"the experience acquired over the years has enabled us to take on large-scale projects\". With a team of around twenty people, the company offers customers flexible and specific solutions while maintaining a focus on customisation and efficiency.\nZeatz has increased its innovation capacity with the help of TECNALIA\nThis cooperation has enabled it to integrate advanced technologies into its products, such as thermal offsetting and digital footprints. A prime example is the recent development of a high-capacity physical cyber dividing head, designed to improve accuracy and functionality in complex industrial processes.\nZeatz is currently immersed in large-scale projects, such as the design of 4th and 5th axis dividing heads with palletising systems and large milling and turning dividing heads, which can reach 4,000 to 6,000 mm. These developments address customers’ increasing demand for more robust and versatile equipment to increase productivity.\nThese dividing heads enable a part to be machined, i.e. cut, drilled or moulded, to be positioned with extreme precision. They are essential in the manufacture of complex components, such as:\n- Aeronautical parts, where maximum precision in angles and cuts is required.\n- Components for the energy sector, such as turbines or industrial gears.\n- Advanced machinery, increasing production efficiency and quality.\nThese systems help ensure that every manufactured part complies with exact tolerances, which is vital in industries in which a slight error can compromise the safety or performance of the final product\nZeatz proves that a combination of expertise, technological adaptation and strategic collaboration is key to remaining a leader in the advanced manufacturing industry, consolidating its position as a trusted partner in the creation of customised and efficient solutions.",
