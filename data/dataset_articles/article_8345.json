  "text": "Srinagar, Jun 22: Jammu and Kashmir’s Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha Saturday said the Administration and the Security Forces have made special arrangements for the successful conduct of Amarnath Yatra and this year the pilgrimage will be smoother than previous years. “Today, Pratham Puja of Baba Amarnath has concluded and the annual pilgrimage will start on June 29. This year, the administration and the security forces have made special arrangements for the smooth conduct of pilgrimage. A multi-layer security grid is in place for the peaceful Yatra,” the LG told a selected group of reporters at Rajbhawan here, as per news agency—Kashmir News Observer (KNO). He said that the road stretch leading to the cave shrine has been upgraded by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) to ensure hassle free movement of pilgrims. The LG urged the people of Kashmir to keep their age-old tradition of supporting and facilitating the Yatra alive and hoped that this year’s Yatra will be smoother and more successful than previous years. “Peaceful and smooth pilgrimage helps create a good image of J&K in the country and the world,” he said.",
