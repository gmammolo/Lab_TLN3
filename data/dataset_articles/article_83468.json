  "text": "FIRST Robotics Duluth Regionals take over the DECC\nHigh school students from all across 8 different states are putting their robots to the test at the FIRST Robotics Duluth Regional Competition.\nFrom Thursday through Saturday will have the opportunity to present their hard work after an intense six weeks of designing, building and programming their robot in the FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics Competition.\nThis year the DECC is hosting 110 teams, with more than 2,500 students competing. Winners at the Duluth Regionals will earn a spot the international FIRST Championship to be held in Houston, Texas.\nThis years game is underwater themed. The robots can score in a multitude of ways but mostly they are trying to put PCV pipes on the “coral reef” and then try to pick up the “algae” and put it up in a net.",
