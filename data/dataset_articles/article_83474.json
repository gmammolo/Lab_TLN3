  "text": "Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet service has emerged as a potential solution for the Federal Aviation Administration’s aging air traffic control systems, with the agency testing the technology even as Democratic lawmakers raised conflict of interest concerns.\nStarlink’s internet terminals are being tested at multiple FAA sites for a possible air traffic control upgrade, according to CBS News.\nStarlink appears poised to take over the $2 billion contract given to telecom provider Verizon in 2023, with Verizon tasked with implementing fiber optic cables to replace the aging, ground-based communications system currently in place.\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy has confirmed that the agency is reviewing various proposals, but said no final decisions have been made.\nEarlier this week, Elon Musk criticized the existing air traffic control network, posting on X that the “Verizon system is not working and so is putting air travelers at serious risk.”\nSoon after, he clarified that the “ancient system” he was referring to was created by defense contractor L3Harris and that Verizon’s new replacement technology is “not yet operational.”\nVerizon spokesman Kevin Israel told reporters that the company is “working on building the next generation system for the FAA,” adding that they are “at the beginning of a multiyear contract to replace antiquated, legacy systems.”\nBloomberg News reported that Musk recently approved the shipment of 4,000 Starlink terminals to the FAA for potential testing, citing an individual familiar with the matter.\nSome Democrats are concerned that this represents a conflict of interest for the administration, as Musk is heavily involved in the administration and donated more than a quarter billion dollars to the Trump 2024 campaign.\n“How much richer will Elon get with an FAA contract to another one of his companies? My ELON MUSK Act would stop this blatant corruption,” Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) wrote on X.\nHowever, the FAA clarified in a Monday statement that they have been testing Starlink satellites “since the prior administration to increase reliability at remote sites.”",
