  "text": "Glass fiber-reinforced thermoplastic boat mold. Photo Credit: Arkema\nIn collaboration with milling and tooling company Merritt Precision (Merritt Island, Fla., U.S.), a Correct Craft company, Arkema (King of Prussia, Pa., U.S.) unveils its first entirely recyclable glass fiber composite mold using Elium liquid thermoplastic resin. The recyclable resin has been meticulously tailored for infusion processes of sizable components with low viscosity, long reactivity and a low exothermic reaction. While its use extends to diverse mold types, Elium resin is particularly suited for the marine sector, catering to the fabrication of composite watercraft .\nFollowing IBEX 2023 in Tampa, Fla., U.S., Elium will be made commercially available. “The qualities inherent in the fully recyclable composite mold are not only beneficial for the ecosystem but also meet the needs of our manufacturing process,” Greg Warren, Merritt Precision’s technical director of operations, says.",
