  "text": "Ukrainian developers invited to NATO Innovation Challenge for the first time.\nThe Ministry of Defense reported that NATO has allowed developers and scientists from Ukraine to participate in the hackathon aimed at addressing common threats for the first Time.\nThe event will take place on March 27, 2025, in the city of Bydgoszcz (Poland), and it can also be joined online. This year's hackathon theme is countering guided aerial bombs (GAB), as reported by the Ministry of Defense.\nNATO Innovation Challenge is a hackathon organized by NATO's Innovation Hub (Allied Command Transformation) and member states of the Alliance. The competition allows scientific associations, individual innovators, or startups to showcase themselves and promote collaboration between NATO and industry representatives.\n'Enemy GABs are one of the biggest threats to Ukrainian military forces on the front lines and Ukrainian cities. It is important that this topic is key for the upcoming NATO hackathon. This demonstrates that we are in the same security context as the Alliance,' said Deputy Minister of Defense Valeriy Churkin.\nPreviously, only representatives from NATO member states could participate in the NATO Innovation Challenge. This year, representatives from Ukraine have also been allowed to participate.\nRead also",
