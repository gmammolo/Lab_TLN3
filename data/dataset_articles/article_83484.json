  "text": "The New Zealand operation of global IT infrastructure services provider Kyndryl returned to profit in the year ending 31 March, 2024, according to accounts posted with the Companies Office this month.\nWhile total sales declined from $78.2 million to $75 million, profit rallied from a $7.1 million loss in 2023 into the black by $7.8 million.\nThat turnaround was delivered courtesy of significantly lower cost of sales, down from $84.1 million to $62.2 million.\nThe accounts also reveal the price T4 Group paid for Kyndryl’s East Tamaki data centre last year: $5.7 million.\nKyndryl NZ could not comment specifically on the results, but did provide a general business update.\nAfter joining the business last April, country leader Jo Healey had been working with local customers to plan the next phase of their technology transformation journeys, drawing on use-cases from Kyndryl’s global expertise in banking and insurance, retail and education.\nIn November 2024, the company also appointed Kimberley Marlay as head of alliances and strategic partnerships for A/NZ.\n“As cloud continues to be a strong area of growth for Kyndryl locally and there is an increasing shift towards a hybrid cloud model, Kimberley is focused on deepening our joint value propositions with the hyperscalers,” Healey said.\nOrganisations were still investing in their mission-critical IT infrastructure, she said.\n“Our business is not discretionary, as evidenced in our last earnings call with reports of 20 per cent growth in five of our six practice areas globally.\n“We’re seeing this in New Zealand through the conversations we’re having with customers and the demand for Kyndryl to continue providing technology services.”\n“There was an appetite to invest in secure and resilient systems particularly in industries such as financial services where Kyndryl had a “strong footprint”, Healey said.\nThe rise of hybrid cloud also allowed businesses to share data between their on-premises infrastructure and the cloud, hosted in new hyperscaler facilities that were significantly more energy efficient and cost effective than their older, subscale counterparts.\n“This evolution presents an opportunity for companies like Kyndryl to embrace a more flexible and reliable way of managing data center operations — and ultimately position us to better meet our customers’ growing business needs for decades to come,” Healey said.",
