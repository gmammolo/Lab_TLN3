  "text": "Chorus has renewed its field services agreements with long-standing partners Downer NZ and UCG in deals worth around $1 billion.\nWhile Downer and UCG will lead core network activities, Chorus said large-scale build projects remained open to other providers.\nVentia, for example, was currently delivering a fibre rollout to approximately 10,000 premises across 59 communities by mid-2025.\nThe renewed agreements build on ones inked in 2022 and run through to 2032 and 2035 respectively. They will support build, maintenance, and connection activities across Chorus’ critical broadband network.\nFrom April, Downer NZ will manage network activities across the South Island and lower North Island under a seven-year contract while UCG will continue to oversee work in the upper North Island.\nChorus GM of customer and network operations Marcus Wofinden said the agreements provided the stability necessary for a rapidly evolving industry.\n“We ran a robust process considering different options to deliver sustainable outcomes beyond the expected retirement of the copper network by 2030,” he said.\n“This is yet another major investment in New Zealand’s digital infrastructure, reinforcing fibre as the gold standard for connectivity, delivering benefits that extend far beyond the broadband network itself.”\nDowner told the market the contract was valued at more than $550 million and expanded the scope of the current deal, which Downer has held since 2022.\nThe scope of work covered construction and augmentation of the fibre network, copper and fibre network maintenance and restoration, customer connections, and maintenance in single dwelling, multi-dwelling and commercial premises.\n“We look forward to furthering our partnership with Chorus to provide end-to-end technology and communications solutions, and are committed to enhancing Chorus customers’ experience as they connect to the network or have faults repaired,” Downer chief executive Peter Tompkins said.\nUCG chief executrive Ralf Luna also welcomed his company’s contract extension.\n“UCG has been an important partner to Chorus for more than a decade as we have supported the game-changing rollout of New Zealand’s broadband fibre network,” he said.\n“We will continue to have responsibility for activities in the upper North Island, and welcome the extension of our existing full scope contract to 2035, and possibly beyond.”\nHaving a sustainable business pathway for the next decade was of strong benefit to UCG’s employees, delivery partners and customers, he said.",
