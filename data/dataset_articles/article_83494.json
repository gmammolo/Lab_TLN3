  "text": "- cross-posted to:\nhackernews@lemmy.bestiver.se\n- cross-posted to:\nhackernews@lemmy.bestiver.se\nI’m not well versed in C&C, but it’s always good to see more games open sourced.\nlog in or registerto comment.\nThis is brilliant! :) aw, I hope it benefits the OpenRA developers and means more fun things to play eventually :)\nWait… this is EA… are they okay? This is very unlike them\nI hope everyone’s SSDs have enough SPACE\nTo use the compiled binaries, you must own the game\nWas expecting a catch. Still good for modding I guess\nAnyone know if this is a technologically-enforced “must” or just a “pretty please”?\nOpen source does not mean that the intellectual property is free. There’s a lot of good that comes from this, and it’s not like those games are expensive.\nThough do also note that of these four, TD and RA1 were already made freeware years ago.\nI realize. Intellectual property is an icky concept IMO but I know not everyone agrees\nIntellectual property is what allows them to make these games GPL.\nThe entire series is on sale on Steam right now for $6 if that helps.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1213210/Command__Conquer_Remastered_Collection/That’s only the HD remaster of TD and RA1.\nIt’s about thyme!\nNo matter what you think of EA, this is fantastic news.\nPerhaps why this feels like them trying to save face.\nThis feels more like some o.g. Command and conquer devs who have worked at EA for a long time that are passionate about the franchise. There was no big PR release, no product tie in or announcement, no media campaign.\nRecovering and restoring the source code for these titles was made possible through the combined efforts of EA technical director Brian Barnes, Respawn producer Jim Vessella, and Luke Feenan, a long-standing member of the C&C community who was involved in the development of the Command & Conquer Remastered Collection.\nhttps://www.polygon.com/news/531365/command-and-conquer-open-source-code-eaIIRC, a few years ago EA hired some of the original devs, put them in charge of the franchise, and then went very hands-off, but with very little budget. So far they’ve done this, and a very reasonably priced 4K remaster of TD and RA1.\nAh well I’m glad to see the devs sticking to their passions. I’m sure they’re proud of this move.\nWith that said, I’m still surprised EA didn’t try to capitalize on it somehow.\nOn what?\nJust in general. EA has a lot to around for.\nExtremely rare EA win\nOpen sourcing old games is awesome for video game preservation.\nOld games being open sourced is a trend I can get behind.\nFuck EA but cool move - if they keep being not shit for long enough I might consider their products again.\nDoubt they can keep it up.\nI’m ready for a zero hour remake!\nIm now just happy that it’s far more likely for a clean 60fps mod that’s not locked behind someone’s patreon\nIt’s a kick ass game but some of the tropes didn’t age well.\nAk47s for everyone!\nCan I at least have some shoes?\nEA ? Did I read right ?\nMmmmm pre-standard C++\nRENEGADE!!!\nLoved Renegade so much. Played the shit out of the MP back in the day.\nThat game seemed so underappreciated. I would be thrilled if I could have another LAN party with it.\nWell I’m very excited to see the injection of life this hopefully gives c&c modding\nI wonder how many of the old guard are still around, I’m glad the cncnet project is still going strong",
