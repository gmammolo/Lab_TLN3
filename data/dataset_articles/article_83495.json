Construction is in final stage, with construction of ward and intensive care unit nearing completion.\nAccording to officials, hospital administration has approved proposal to govt for recruitment of seven doctors and 10 technical staff for liver transplant services through advertisement. Additionally, 10 ICU beds are being prepared for bone marrow transplant services, while six ICU beds each are being set up for liver and kidney transplants.\nThey said liver transplant services will also ease burden on King George's Medical University, currently the only govt institute in the region offering such services.\nCurrently, RMLIMS offers kidney transplant services, conducting over 150 kidney transplants successfully. A senior official said the institute planned to centralise all transplant services on a dedicated floor in the super specialty building to streamline patient care. \"We are hopeful the recruitment process would be complete by end of Jun and by Jul services would start,\" said a senior official.\nDirector MLIMS Prof C M Singh said the expansion will enhance the institute's capacity to provide advanced medical care, benefiting patients requiring complex transplant procedures.\nStay updated with breaking news , bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march .\nEnd of Article FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Tired of too many ads? go ad free now Trending Stories In City Entire Website Tired of too many ads? go ad free now",
