  "text": "Automakers have been redefining themselves as tech firms, with brands debuting cars at events like CES over traditional affairs like the Detroit Auto Show. That should not be too surprising. Producing vehicle hardware is costly and complicated and generates little profit with a single purchase. Introducing software requires comparatively little profit and can be a consistent source of revenue — especially if you get buyers hooked on subscription plans they forget about.\nGeneral Motors has been bullish about promoting Super Cruise, its Level 2 hands-free driving technology. GM CEO Mary Barra told Automotive News that the brand expects Super Cruise to earn $2 billion in revenue annually within five years.\nRelated\nWhy GM's Super Cruise Is The Best Autonomous Tech I've Tested In My Career\nAfter testing every carmaker's autonomous driving technology, I can safely say that GM Super Cruise is by far the best there is.\nGM Expects a Lot More People to Use Super Cruise\nSuper Cruise began as a niche product on high-end Cadillac trims. However, the technology has now proliferated throughout the company's brand portfolio, particularly with EVs. GM estimates that the number of Super Cruise-equipped vehicles on the road will jump from around 360,000 to 720,000 by year's end.\nGM noted a 20 percent conversion to subscription rate after 18,000 owners had their three-year trials expire. The brand expects that percentage to increase as the pool widens to pickup drivers taking advantage of Super Cruise working while towing. Even if the rate remains static, a few thousand subscribers in 2025 could easily become a few hundred thousand by 2030.\nSuper Cruise Is the Best Level 2 Autonomous Driving System\nNearly every automaker has debuted some form of an automated highway driving system. But GM's Super Cruise, which we've tested in multiple vehicles, performs the best. Super Cruise is legitimately hands-free. It works consistently, smoothly and intuitively — while towing and in heavy traffic.\nSuper Cruise may lack some functionality, like Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving operation off highways. However, GM ensures that when it implements a feature, it works. Even the most skeptical and cantankerous car journalists will sing Super Cruise's praises and use it in real life with their families in tow.\nTopSpeed's Take\nCar buyers instinctively dislike and distrust in-car subscription plans. BMW, notably, has sparked backlashes by charging for relatively mundane features like heated seats and access to Apple Carplay, which owners could previously access for free. But Super Cruise may be a better use of subscription plans.\nSuper Cruise provides a premium service for the expenditure. So, it feels less like BMW nickel-and-diming after an owner dropped $80,000-plus on an X5 crossover. And buyers — if they think a bit harder about it — may appreciate the flexibility. Most buyers won't hold onto their vehicles for 10 years. So, paying a $250 per year subscription plan may save money over buying Super Cruise up front. And the owner who uses Super Cruise on one road trip per year should appreciate being able to sign up for one month for $25.",
