  "text": "Ras Ajai on a wave Ras Ajai has done a lot of legwork in the past six months helping to promote Bob Marley: One Love, the successful Paramount Pictures biopic. He has a small role as Claudius Massop, the West Kingston enforcer who was a close friend of the reggae legend. While excited about his first major acting gig, the New York-based Ras Ajai is also known for his music. He recently completed a 20-date tour of the United States with Sean Paul, whose Dutty Rock camp he has been a member for six years. The dreadlocked deejay is one of eight acts on the Inviting rhythm, a compilation album produced by Most Wanted Records. His song on the project is Well Misbehave. “It was introduced to me by [singjay] Izrel while we were doing some writing for a album we are working on and I decided I had to be a part of it. A rhythm of this magnitude can benefit a artiste by being present with a quality song that people will remember as well as consider synonymous with it,” said Ras Ajai. Born Brian Todd Boucher, the Waterford-reared artiste has been recording music since 2008. His previous songs include Di Ras Hot, Vice Grip, and Buss A Bubble (with Sean Paul). The Inviting rhythm, which also has songs by Izrel, Kiprich, Mr Banging, and Dancehall Police, is scheduled for release in July. Ras Ajai enjoyed playing Massop, who was controversially killed by police in Kingston in 1979. He had no professional acting experience going into production, and initially auditioned for the role of Alvin “Seeco” Patterson, the percussionist who was a member of Marley’s band. “Being in the movie has most definitely changed my life, it’s been a whirlwind experience. Being in the spaces I’ve been in, and being recognised by people you grew up wishing to be like, to then rub shoulders. It’s been a blessing,” he said.",
