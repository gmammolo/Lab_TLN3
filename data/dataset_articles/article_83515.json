  "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s recent decision to ban Red No. 3 — a synthetic dye linked to cancer in animal studies — may leave some food manufacturers searching for safer alternatives. Groundbreaking research from The Ohio State University College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences (CFAES) offers a promising solution.\nMonica Giusti, a distinguished professor and associate department chair in the CFAES Department of Food Science and Technology, has pioneered research on anthocyanins — natural pigments responsible for the vibrant hues in fruits like blackberries, red cabbage, and grapes. These compounds present an exciting opportunity to replace synthetic dyes while potentially offering health benefits.\n“Consumers increasingly demand clean labels and natural ingredients, and the FDA’s decision highlights the urgency of innovation in this area,” said Giusti, who is also a Fellow in the National Academy of Inventors. “Anthocyanins are not just natural replacements; they also have health-promoting properties.”\nThese pigments deliver rich, stable shades of red, orange, and yellow and are a functional, sustainable alternative to synthetic dyes like Red No. 3.\nScience behind the color\nGiusti’s work focuses on extracting anthocyanins and improving their stability for a range of food applications. Traditional, natural colorants often degrade under heat, light, or exposure to common additives like vitamin C, but her team has produced pyranoanthocyanins — compounds that maintain their vibrancy under challenging conditions.\n“By understanding the chemistry of anthocyanins and their interaction with different food matrices, we can create products that meet industry needs while aligning with consumer preferences for healthier options,” Giusti said.\nHer research has led to colorants suitable for beverages, confections, and baked goods, all tailored to withstand real-world food processing conditions.\n“Losing Red No. 3 creates challenges for the food industry, but it’s also an opportunity to innovate and provide consumers with better options,” Giusti said. “Anthocyanins aren’t just a natural replacement; they bring added nutritional benefits that synthetic dyes can’t offer.”\nMeeting industry needs\nAs public awareness of artificial additives grows, food companies face mounting pressure to find clean-label solutions without compromising performance or shelf life. Giusti’s research bridges this gap, offering versatile, natural alternatives that deliver reliable results.\n“Anthocyanins align with what today’s consumers value: transparency, natural origins, and even health benefits,” Giusti said.\nHer lab’s work has been adopted by companies integrating anthocyanin-based colorants into products ranging from beverages to baked goods. Key applications include the following.\n- Beverages: Creating vibrant hues for fruit juices and sports drinks while adding antioxidants\n- Confections: Replacing synthetic dyes in gummies and hard candies\n- Baked goods: Developing heat-stable pigments that retain their color through baking\n“Replacing Red No. 3 is about more than aesthetics; it’s about transforming how we think about food additives,” Giusti said.\nTailored solutions\nOne unique aspect of Giusti’s work is her collaboration with food manufacturers to customize solutions for specific challenges.\n“Whether it’s a stable red for a beverage or a heat-resistant pigment for baked goods, we can develop tailored solutions,” she said.\nHer team also partners with agricultural producers to repurpose underutilized crops — those that don’t meet fresh-market standards — into sources of natural colorants.\n“It’s about adding value throughout the supply chain, from farm to table, and finding sustainable ways to produce colorants,” Giusti said.\nThe lab’s support extends beyond science, assisting companies in navigating regulatory hurdles to bring new colorants to market.\n“This collaborative effort benefits everyone — from farmers and manufacturers to consumers seeking safer, healthier products,” she said.\nA vision for the future\nWhile addressing immediate industry needs, Giusti envisions broader impacts. She hopes to establish a natural color research center at Ohio State, where scientists and industry leaders can collaborate to advance natural dye technology.\n“This transition away from synthetic dyes is an incredible opportunity — not just to meet consumer demand for clean-label ingredients, but to introduce compounds with potential health benefits,” Giusti said.\nHer work also includes developing blue colorants, which are particularly challenging to achieve in acidic foods, further establishing her lab as a leader in natural pigment research.\nBeyond Red No. 3\nWhile the FDA’s ban on Red No. 3 addresses safety concerns, Giusti emphasizes that synthetic dyes served a purpose.\n“They’ve been widely used because they work,” she said. “But if we can offer better alternatives — compounds that are safe, natural, and even beneficial — why wouldn’t we use them?”\nThe FDA’s decision presents a challenge and an opportunity for the food industry.\n“There are already many natural options available,” Giusti said. “And if companies can’t find the right fit, we’re here to help them innovate.”\nShaping the future of food\nGiusti’s work exemplifies how academic research can address real-world challenges. Her lab collaborates with companies of all sizes, resolves technical issues, and explores untapped potential in natural pigments to advance sustainable food solutions.\n“At Ohio State, we’re not just solving today’s problems; we’re shaping the future of food,” Giusti said.\nAs the industry moves toward safer, cleaner alternatives, Giusti’s research offers a vibrant path forward — prioritizing health, sustainability, and the colors consumers love.\nFor more information about Giusti’s research on anthocyanins and their applications, visit u.osu.edu/giustilab/.\nMonica Giusti\n614-247-8016\ngiusti.6@osu.edu",
