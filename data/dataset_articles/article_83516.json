  "text": "Lingenfelter Performance Engineering is a top name in Chevrolet tuning, not to mention being a talented modifier of other General Motors vehicles. The company’s latest project is something unusual, though.\nThe company takes the latest Chevrolet Corvette C8 and dumps the original 6.2-liter V8 in favor of a naturally aspirated 7.0-liter eight-cylinder powerplant. Rather than the base model, the company selects the hybrid-assisted E-Ray for this engine swap. The company calls this conversion the Eliminator Spec S.\nLingenfelter’s 7.0-liter V-8 produces a claimed 700 horsepower and 600 pound-feet of torque at the crankshaft. The company recently put one on a dynamometer to see how much power goes to the wheels. Watch the test, below.\nRelated\nHere's How Much A Fully-Loaded Chevy Corvette ZR1 Costs (In Both Trim Levels)\nThe customizable Build And Buy Configurator is now live for the 2025 Chevy Corvette ZR1.\nSee What Lingenfelter’s Big Block Corvette Can Do\nLingenfelter offers this performance package on the base C8 Stingray and the electrified E-Ray. This video shows that the massive engine alone sends 577 horsepower and 528 pound-feet of torque at the wheels. The table below compares these figures to Chevy’s other models of the new ‘Vette.\nKeep in mind that the standard Corvette C8 Stingray uses a 6.2-liter V8, making 490 horsepower in the entry-level model. Callaway fits an engine that displaces considerably more at 7.0 liters.\nIn addition to the increased size, Callaway’s engine features a variety of strengthened and modified pieces. The tuner contributes improved H-beam connecting rods and an upgraded crankshaft. Plus, there are Mahle pistons, a revised camshaft, and revisions to the powertrain’s oiling system.\nThe larger, naturally aspirated engine makes Callaway’s modified Corvette sound like a vintage muscle car. As the driver presses the accelerator, the exhaust note transitions from a growl at low rpms to a roar as the revs rise.\nRelated\nHere’s How Much A Fully Loaded 2025 Chevy Corvette Costs\nDiscover the price of a fully loaded 2025 Chevy Corvette, breaking down all the top features and packages that make this sports car truly stand out.\nAn Expensive Upgrade\nThis engine upgrade is a fairly expensive modification to a C8 Corvette. The kit costs $29,950, which includes installation and the core charge discount. However, there are several upgrades that most customers would want. For example, the listed options include an enlarged throttle body, cold-air intake, improved axles, and two exhaust choices.\nA base 2025 Corvette Stingray starts at $69,995, meaning Lingenfelter’s upgrade would take the vehicle’s price to around $100,000. The factory’s own E-Ray, Z06 and ZR1 models cost even more.\nTuning the C8 Corvette is already a big business, and companies are finding ways to extract a significant amount of power from the various versions of their V-8 powerplants. For example, Yenko is introducing a twin-turbo kit that pushes the engine output to 1,250 horsepower.\nRelated\n10 Key Differences Between The Chevy Corvette ZR1 and Corvette Z06\nCheck out key differences between the new Chevy Corvette ZR1 and Corvette Z06.\nTopSpeed’s Take\nCorvette tuning is among the most exciting aspects of the current aftermarket industry. It seems like every few weeks we see a company introduce a new, more powerful tune. If folks want a performance vehicle to modify, the C8 seems like one of the most popular products on the scene right now.",
