  "text": "Bosch drove a care equipped with its bold brake-by-wire system for 2,000 miles in 6 days—and survived. Here's how the bold technology works. Bosch made its bones building reliable, best-in-class power tools. But you might not know that the German brand has also had a mobility division for over a century, developing industry-leading braking and steering systems. Now, Bosch's latest invention, brake-by-wire, eliminates the \"mechanical\" connections from the brake pedal to the brakes.\nIf that gives you pause, brake-by-wire testing is working—so far—on public roads. Bosch's development team, based in Abstatt, Germany, recently took the technology onto the open road using a Nissan Ariya (modified with Bosch brake-by-wire) to tackle a 2,050-mile, six-day road trip from southern Germany to the brand's winter test center in northern Sweden.\n\"With our first long-distance test, we impressively demonstrated that we can bring a real brake-by-wire system safely and successfully from the track to the road,\" Hagen Kuckert, the project manager for the by-wire brake actuator, said in a recent Bosch press release.\nAutomakers have taken notice of brake-by-wire benefits, as Bosch has reportedly received multiple orders already. The technology will officially launch this fall, with the German brand forecasting 5.5 million vehicles to be equipped with brake-by-wire by 2030.\nWhat Is Brake-by-Wire?\nPh. Courtesy Bosch\nThere's a misnomer that \"digital\" braking is a wireless system with zero physical connection. Bosch markets its system as brake-by-wire, meaning there's a wire connecting the brake pedal to an electronic controller instead of a hydraulic hose coupled to a brake caliper. This means the system's logic doesn't change that much—or at all. Pressing the brake pedal sends an electronic signal to the braking system instead of sending hydraulic fluid.…\nMatt Crisara",
