  "text": "The discovery more than doubled the number of intermediate-mass black holes we'd seen before. Intermediate-mass black holes—somewhere between stellar-mass and supermassive—are the rarest type of black hole in the universe.\n300 of these elusive black holes were recently observed by NSF NOIRLab's DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument).\nWhile some are the active galactic nuclei of dwarf galaxies, most are thought to have been the seeds of what are now supermassive black holes.\nSome black holes are supermassive beasts up to tens of billions of times the mass of our Sun. Then, there are stellar-mass black holes, which top out at a few solar masses. So... what fills the void in between?\nOne of the rarest types of black holes in the universe are intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Sometimes referred to as \"missing link\" black holes, these cosmic gaping maws—which can be anywhere from about 100 to 100,000 solar masses in size—have proved difficult to find. Recently, however, NSF NOIRLab's Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has been able to detect 300 more of them. DESI also detected active black holes in many dwarf galaxies, which are exactly what they sound like—rather small black holes with only a handful of stars (if you could call thousands to several billion a handful) scattered around.\nRelated Story Will We Really Reach Singularity in 12 Months?\nOnly between 100 and 150 IMBHs were known, until now. Using the new data, a research team led by Ragadeepika Pucha from the University of Utah wanted to find out what intermediate-mass black holes can tell us about black hole formation.\nSupermassive black holes…\nElizabeth Rayne",
