  "text": "By harnessing the unique auditory capabilities of these insects, scientists hope to revolutionize the capabilities of disaster relief efforts. Mosquito antennae are complex structures that transduce sound into electrical signals, which are then zapped to the brain.\nDifferent mosquito species have antennae structured to pick up different sounds, such as frog calls or the sound of female wingbeats.\nIn the future, the antennae of what we think of as pests could inspire both soundproofing and sound-detecting materials.\nMosquitoes. We swat them, spray them, and otherwise try to get rid of them by any means necessary. But it turns out that these insects—which have been little more than insufferable pest to humanity for most of our existence—might actually be useful for something.\nHypersensitive mosquito antennae are able to pick up specific signals, even through the buzz of their noisy wingbeats, and a team of researchers hoped that finding out how they do it could inspire soundproofing materials and super-sensors. The interdisciplinary team, led by Pablo Zavattieri and Ximena Bernal of Purdue University, zoomed in on the antennae of two mosquito species using microscopy and CT scanning. What they saw were complex structures built to optimize sound detection.\nAedes aegypti and Uranotaenia lowii are mosquito species which use the acute hearing capabilities of their antennae for different purposes. Ae. aegypti males seek out potential mates by listening for female wingbeats, and U. lowii females (which need a blood meal to lay eggs) hunt for frogs to prey…\nElizabeth Rayne",
