  "text": "Starwood Property Trust ( STWD Quick Quote STWD - Free Report ) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.46 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.58 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.35%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this commercial real estate investment trust would post earnings of $0.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.48, delivering a surprise of 4.35%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\nStarwood Property Trust , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust industry, posted revenues of $454.39 million for the quarter ended December 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.73%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $522.28 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\nStarwood Property Trust shares have added about 5.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.3%.\nWhat's Next for Starwood Property Trust? While Starwood Property Trust has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nAhead of this earnings release , the estimate revisions trend for Starwood Property Trust: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.50 on $468 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.97 on $1.88 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust is currently in the bottom 34% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\nOne other stock from the same industry, ACRES Commercial ( ACR Quick Quote ACR - Free Report ) , is yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2024. The results are expected to be released on March 5.\nThis commercial real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.22 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -60%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nACRES Commercial's revenues are expected to be $10.2 million, down 23.7% from the year-ago quarter.",
