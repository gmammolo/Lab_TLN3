  "text": "(Reuters) - Autodesk forecast annual revenue and profit above Wall Street estimates on Thursday, boosted by strong demand for its design and engineering software across industries such as construction and manufacturing.\nThe company also said it would reduce its workforce by about 9%, representing roughly 1,350 employees, and laid out plans to invest more heavily in cloud and artificial intelligence, adding that it would reallocate resources towards those areas.\nCompanies across sectors such as architecture, engineering, construction and product design are making extensive use of Autodesk's 3D design solutions, with the software maker's artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities further driving spending on its products.\nAutodesk saw a 23% jump in total billings to $2.11 billion in the fourth quarter ended January 31.\nThe company's international operations have particularly shown strength, while analysts have also noted that the company was outpacing peers in the manufacturing sector, driven by the performance of its 'Fusion' design software.\nShares of the San Francisco, California-based company were up about 2% in extended trading.\nAutodesk expects full-year revenue between $6.90 billion and $6.97 billion, largely above analysts' average estimate of $6.90 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.\nIt projected an adjusted profit between $9.34 and $9.67 per share for its fiscal year 2026, also above the $9.24 per share estimated by analysts.\nThe company reported total revenue of $1.64 billion in the fourth quarter, up 12% from last year and above analysts' average estimate of $1.63 billion. It posted an adjusted profit of $2.29 per share, beating estimates of $2.14 per share.\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Mohammed Safi Shamsi)\nCopyright 2025 Thomson Reuters .\nJoin the Conversation See Comments Tags: United States\nRead More",
