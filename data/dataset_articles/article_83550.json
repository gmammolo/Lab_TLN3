  "text": "So this is wild. Simply smelling a cup of coffee can give you the same energy boost as drinking it. Maybe. New research suggests it might.\nDr. Supriya Rao explains in a story posted at Delish.com that certain scents can stimulate the brain and “enhance alertness,” some of them even help us focus and boost our energy. A recent study from Reviva Coffee links five scents to increased energy levels. Smelling these things in the morning could help kickstart your day.\nLemongrass - This scent stimulates both dopamine and serotonin, which can improve your mood, as well as focus and alertness. According to another recent study, just inhaling lemongrass oil improved reaction times. Lemongrass can also decrease brain fog and promote mental clarity.\nCoffee beans - Even if you don’t drink the stuff, just smelling roasted coffee beans can make your brain more alert without ever taking a sip. Functional Nutrition Specialist Jennifer Nicole Bianchini explains, \"The simple act of inhaling the scent of coffee activates the central nervous system and increases alertness by triggering dopamine pathways—our feel good neurotransmitters—in the brain.\"\nPeppermint - Menthol, the active ingredient in peppermint, activates parts of the brain that improve attention span, alertness and learning capacity. It may even help lower the release of cortisol, which helps lower stress.\nOrange - The scent of this citrus is known to instantly boost our mood and improve attention.\nChocolate - It’s not just the taste we love, the scent of chocolate stimulates the reward center in the brain, which causes the release of dopamine, giving us a big boost of happiness. Bianchini says the smell of chocolate can even improve cognitive function, too.\nSee more from Delish.com HERE .",
