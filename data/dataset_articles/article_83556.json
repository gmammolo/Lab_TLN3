  "text": "By Semafor Africa\nPhotos: Wikimedia Commons\nThe share of renewables in Africa’s power generation mix will jump to more than 40% by 2030, up from 27% today, according to a new report.\nGeothermal and hydropower energy are leading the way in East and West Africa, which boast cleaner energy sources than the continent’s more fossil fuel-heavy north and south.\nBut there is much untapped potential in solar and wind energy , said a new report by the African Energy Chamber, a South Africa-based advocacy group, along with scope to drastically increase hydropower generation.\nHydropower has been the largest renewable energy source on the continent to date, contributing up to 90% of the power mix in countries such as Ethiopia and DR Congo.",
