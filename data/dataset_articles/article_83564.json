  "text": "I took a 2025 Isuzu MU-X off-roading, and it blew my mind\nI went off-roading for the first time in the new 2025 Isuzu MU-X and what I learned was eye-opening. Here's what I found...\nHaving tried almost every type of driving discipline, the last thing I had to cross off my list was off-roading – which is why when the opportunity came to take the updated 2025 Isuzu MU-X off the beaten track, I jumped at the chance.\nAnd boy was I thrown in the deep end.\nI'm not exactly sure why off-roading is the last thing I've undertaken. I think it's the fear of getting stuck somewhere or maybe how easy it is to damage your car when crawling through some tough terrain.\nRegardless, Isuzu Australia had mapped out a route through the Black Duck Valley 4x4 Park in East Haldon, Queensland, to take a stock LS-M MU-X through some rough terrain.\nWhat's new for the 2025 Isuzu MU-X?\nUpdates to the exterior of the 2025 Isuzu MU-X are mostly cosmetic, with the front and rear both getting new headlights/tail-lights, a refreshed grille and bumpers.\nThere have also been updates to the interior – with a bigger infotainment screen in the entry-level LS-M variant and upgraded units in all other versions.\nThere's also a new flagship grade – the X-Terrain, which features 20-inch alloy wheels, red and grey stitching across the leather-accented interior, piano black and silver interior accents, red LED ambient interior lighting, black wheel arch flares, lower body side skirts and an underbody spoiler, as well as an exclusive slate grey metallic colour paint.\nMechanically, small changes have been made to the suspension across the entire range. A 2mm increase in piston size and revised valving promise more high-speed stability and comfort.\nRough Terrain Mode (RTM), an off-road-centric traction-control system, has been refined to work in tandem with the rear differential lock. This means traction control on the front with constant mechanical traction on the rear.\nTo read more about pricing and updates for the facelifted model, head here.\nIs the 2025 model any good off-road?\nDriving the two hours inland from Brisbane, the nerves started to set in. I remembered all those videos I had seen online of amateur off-roaders flipping their cars trying to climb through some ruts and rubble, as well as thinking about the fact that we are taking cars that came off the factory floor a few weeks prior on some rough tracks.\nWe got familiar with the new MU-X, flicking through all the little buttons that should, in theory, help us clear some rough terrain.\nLooking closely at its specification, the MU-X can hop over some serious terrain with a 235mm (230mm for the LS-M) ground clearance, besting many rivals including the Ford Everest (except the Tremor grade), some of the Land Rover Defender's range, and some of the Toyota LandCruiser Prado's range.\nI will admit, it seemed slightly worrying to look down at the tyres and see highway rubber instead of all-terrain tyres, but the people at Isuzu assured us it would be fine.\nNo modifications were made to the cars before we headed off into the 4x4 park. We deflated the tyres to 24psi, a little higher than what you'd normally deflate to. However, it was the happy medium between gaining enough traction to get over the loose stuff while still having enough ground clearance and no worries of debeading the tyre.\nI jumped in the X-Terrain to start the day, adjusted my seating position much higher and more forward than I usually would, switched it to four-wheel-drive high-range, and headed up the mountain.\nWe didn't get far before it was time to switch to 4x4 low-range, which, if you don't know, puts the gearbox into a reduction gear with a 2.482:1 ratio. Essentially that makes your gears around 2.5 times shorter but multiplies your torque by that amount, giving you more grunt to crawl up hills.\nClimbing through some tight sections, I switched on the new camera system that is fitted to the higher-grade LS-T and X-Terrain models. While the selling point was to negate tight spots in a car park, I'm surprised how well it actually works for off-roading.\nEven though my head was nearly touching the roof, I couldn't see over the bonnet. But activating the front camera not only meant I could see around corners better, but I could also spot tall rocks and potential hazards under the car.\nWithin about 10 minutes of light off-roading, we reached a section where we could play with the diff lock and the revised Rough Terrain Mode.\nAs opposed to some other brands that use what's called an 'E-locker', which can either mean that the rear differential simulates a locked diff by actuating the brakes on the side of least resistance to send power to the other wheel or use clutches in a limited-slip diff that doesn't fully lock the diff, the MU-X uses a mechanical locker.\nBy clicking the diff lock button and driving forward, the rear differential locks in place and ensures that power is going to both rear wheels at all times. We were also encouraged to use the new Rough Terrain Mode (RTM).\nThe RTM works similarly to the aforementioned E-locker and is essentially traction control with extra steps. Whereas an open differential would send power to a wheel with the least traction and resistance, the RTM sends torque to the wheel with the most traction. However, while conventional traction control would cut all engine power, the RTM does allow for some slip so you can climb up obstacles smoothly.\nWith RTM and rear diff lock engaged, it was my turn to attempt something. I would probably turn around and walk the other way if I was faced with it on foot. The spotters helped to guide me through some ruts, but the car did the majority of the work.\nIt's an understatement to say I'm shocked at how well something that is normally seen dropping the kids off to soccer practice tackled this terrain. No momentum was needed, as, at all times, the MU-X had a wheel off the ground but could still get going from a standstill.\nYou hear the comment that cars are driving themselves now, and while that statement may be true when it comes to features such as lane-assist and adaptive cruise control, the 2025 Isuzu MU-X seems to fall in a similar but different category. It provides this sort of technology that makes things that used to be possible only in a purpose-built off-roader, now possible in an SUV straight out of the box.\nYou have two engine options for the MU-X – the 1.9-litre that was introduced for the SUV in 2024 and the legendary 3.0-litre 4JJ.\nThe LS-T and X-Terrain come with a 3.0-litre only, while the LS-U comes with a choice between the 3.0-litre in 4x2 or 4x4 or the 1.9-litre in 4x4 only. The LS-M can be optioned with a 1.9-litre or 3.0-litre in both 4x4 and 4x2.\nIn terms of power, the 3.0-litre turbo-diesel has the same old reliable 4J engine that has undergone a plethora of changes over its lifetime and has seriously proven itself in terms of reliability on the Australian market.\nI think the thing that shocks me the most about the MU-X is how basic the engine is to drive. Yes, it has 450Nm of torque, but the throttle mapping applies it calmly and easily. This not only makes it easy to control your throttle application by climbing up steep, loose terrain, but it also makes the car more comfortable to drive on the road.\nJumping into the LS-M, which now only comes with a 1.9-litre (4x4 and 4x2), there surprisingly isn't a noticeable difference between the two engines. You lack 100Nm of torque, but the way the throttle is configured makes it feel relatively similar off-road.\nAgain, the base model is seriously capable of handling a few rough sections. The fact that I was comfortable taking a brand-new car through things I wouldn't take my personal car through is saying something, and the mighty 1.9 did it with zero issues or zero complaints.\nIt's always a bit difficult writing about things that do their job well. It would be easy to pick on the MU-X if it struggled through the route we mapped out, but it didn't. It made the trails we hit feel almost boring, which is high praise for a car that may never see action even on gravel with most of its customers.\nThe 2025 Isuzu MU-X is sort of the medical shoe of cars. It's basic but does its job right and well, especially when you look at others in the category with their tiny engines outputting big power, 10-speed gearboxes, multi-clutch plates, and independent rear suspension – there's just too much to go wrong on those cars.\nIn comparison, the MU-X has everything off-roaders want: a tough live rear axle, a simple six-speed transmission, two capable and proven engines, a diff lock, and traction control. Sure, it has its gadgets, such as cameras and sensors, but when all else ages, the bones of the MU-X will still be the same tough gear that you want, proving that simplicity will always be better when it comes to off-roading.\nHonestly, with a small suspension lift, some A/T tyres and maybe a winch, you would have more than enough to take the MU-X seriously off-road. It's a pretty impressive piece of equipment that is seemingly one of the last of the 'simple is better' generation.\nHow much is the 2025 Isuzu MU-X?\n- MU-X LS-M 1.9L 4x2 – $48,400 ($46,990 drive-away)\n- MU-X LS-M 1.9L 4x4 – $54,400\n- MU-X LS-U 1.9L 4x4 – $61,400\n- MU-X LS-M 3.0L 4x2 – $50,400\n- MU-X LS-U 3.0L 4x2 – $57,400\n- MU-X LS-T 3.0L 4x2 – $65,400\n- MU-X LS-M 3.0L 4x4 – $56,400\n- MU-X LS-U 3.0L 4x4 – $63,400\n- MU-X LS-T 3.0L 4x4 – $71,400 ($69,990 drive-away)\n- MU-X X-Terrain 3.0L 4x4 – $74,400 ($73,990 drive-away)\nNote: All prices above exclude on-road costs unless otherwise stated.",
