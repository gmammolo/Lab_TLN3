  "text": "NASA's stranded astronauts issued a powerful five-word message to Americans concerned about their health and safety Thursday morning. NASA's stranded astronauts have given a rare interview in which they addressed concerns about their health and safety.\nSunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, who were only supposed to spend eight days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) when they arrived on June 6, spoke to Good Morning about their extended stay on Thursday.\nWhen asked if they had a message for people who have been worried about them, Wilmore said: 'We're thankful for your support.'\nThe interview comes just days after Elon Musk said the Starliner crew was abandoned in space by the Biden administration for 'political reasons.'\nWhen asked about Musk's remarks, Wilmore said: 'Political reasons — I have not heard that. I'm not sure that that could be the case based on what I know.'\nHe also explained that he and Williams do not view themselves as 'stranded', saying: 'That's not how we feel.'\nThe two astronauts have now been on the ISS for 266 days. They're currently scheduled to return to Earth on a SpaceX spacecraft in March, but by that time, they will have spent more than nine months in space.\nDuring a Thursday interview with Good Morning America, NASA's stranded astronauts issued a powerful five-word message to Americans: 'We're thankful for your support'\nAmericans have been concerned about Williams and Wilmore since their capsule, Boeing's Starliner, was plagued with issues while taking them to the ISS.\nNASA and Boeing spent months trying to fix helium leaks and other issues, but the craft was eventually deemed unsafe and sent back to Earth in September without the pair.\n'There's many ways to characterize it, stranded I don't think is one of them,' Wilmore told GMA.\n'We came up here with a plan to test out the spacecraft and return. The plan changed.\n'We also…\nEllyn Lapointe",
