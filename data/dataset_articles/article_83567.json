  "text": "Claude 3.7 Sonnet: New AI model promises to “reason” better than the famous and classic ChatGPT!\nA startup anthropic, a direct rival of OpenAI, has just launched its latest new model of artificial intelligence: Claude 3.7 Sonnet. The difference? The promise of reason better, follow instructions more accurately and be much more efficient for programmers, according to the Uol website.\nHybrid AI: Fast thinking and enhanced reasoning\nSecond Jared Kaplan, co-founder of Anthropic, the Claude 3.7 Sonnet goes beyond quick answers. He is a model hybrid, Ou seja, can give instant answers or “think” for longer to solve complex questions, analyze data and write more sophisticated texts.\nBut what changes in practice?\n✔️ More intelligence in programming: Best for developers to code.\n✔️ Increased accuracy: Follows instructions more exactly.\n✔️ Advanced reasoning: Answers difficult questions with improved logic.\n✔️ Long and detailed texts: Greater ability to organize and structure complex content.\nOpenAI vs Anthropic: The New AI Battle\nIn recent months, the dispute between Claude e Chat GPT became even more intense. OpenAI launched GPT-4o, a model that promises to be more human by demonstrating the steps of his “thought”.\nAlready Anthropic innovates in AI autonomy with the function “Computer Use”, allowing Claude access the internet, browse websites and even use programs like a human being.\nThe companies Google, Meta and the Chinese DeepSeek are also racing to master generative AI. The model DeepSeek R1, recently launched, promises very high quality at a lower cost, challenging the giants in the sector.",
