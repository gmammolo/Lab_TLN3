  "text": "New highly anticipated feature allows payments without opening the bank's app! Check out how contactless Pix will work\nFrom next time on Friday (28), Brazilians will be able to use the Pix by approximation, making payments even faster and more practical! Now it will be possible make transfers just by touching your cell phone to the machine, as already happens with credit and debit cards, according to the CNN website.\nThe new eliminates the need to access the bank application to carry out the transaction, making the process more agile and efficient.\nHow does contactless pix work?\n✔️ The user must add Pix to the mobile phone's digital wallet (Google Pay, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, among others).\n✔️ At the time of payment, simply bring the cell phone closer to the machine, review the transaction details and confirm.\n✔️ The maximum value allowed will be R$ 500 per operation, but the user can set smaller or daily limits.\n✔️ Banks, digital wallets and machines are not required to offer the functionality, so it is important to check with your financial institution.\nWill traditional pix end?\nNo! O Pix by proximity is just one extra option. Traditional forms of payment via Pix key and QR Code will continue to exist normally.\n🔹 At first, the function will be available just for Android devices and users of banks participating in the Open Finance.\n🔹 The project began testing in October 2023 in some stores Brasilia and Sao Paulo. Now, the functionality is beginning to be expanded throughout Brazil.\nAdvantages of contactless pix\n✅ faster: You don't need to open the bank app.\n✅ More practicality: It works like a contactless card.\n✅ More safety: Transaction protected by mobile authentication.\n???? Check with your bank and enable this new feature to make your payments easier! 💳📲",
