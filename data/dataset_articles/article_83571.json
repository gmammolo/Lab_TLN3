  "text": "Russian scientists successfully revived 24,000-year-old micro-organisms, bdelloid rotifers, from Siberian permafrost, showcasing the marvel of cryptobiosis. Scientists have revived 24,000-year-old bdelloid rotifer microworms.\nThe rotifers were frozen in permafrost in a long-term cryptobiotic state.\nLessons from these and other revived organisms could help farms on Mars.\nWe promise this isn't as sinister as it sounds: Russian scientists have revived and cloned 24,000-year-old zombies.\nDon't worry—this isn't a Walking Dead situation. The undead organisms in questions are called bdelloid rotifers, or microscopic \"wheel animals\" named for their circular mouths surrounded by tiny hairs. Like the more charismatic tardigrade, bdelloid rotifers are extremophiles —organisms that can withstand astonishing conditions like red-hot undersea vents or the vacuum of space.\nFor this experiment, the scientists went to Siberia and carved off a slice of permafrost, the term for ground that permanently stays frozen. This particular area has been frozen since at least the end of the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago).\nThe scientists took the frozen rotifers and thawed them gently, at which point the rotifers began to just live…\nCaroline Delbert",
