  "text": "Molecular Research Core Facility Honors Student Scientists\nFebruary 27, 2025\nThe science and creativity of students while looking down the eyepiece of a microscope is being highlighted at Idaho State University. Recently, ISU’s Molecular Research Core Facility named the winners of its first-ever student microscopy image competition.\nThe contest asked students to submit their best images taken while working in a research lab at Idaho State or on their own time as hobby microscopists. Entries were judged on their creativity and originality and the accompanying description or image’s impact on their research.\n“We were beyond impressed with all the images submitted for our first student microscopy image competition,” said Lisa McDougall, research associate with the MRCF. “The student researchers at ISU are doing amazing work, and the images were all so interesting that we had a difficult time picking winners.”\nThe winning photo, “Volcanic Evolution,” was taken by David Cavell, a geology master’s student. It features crystals of the mineral olivine collected as part of his research into the geochemistry of Sixmile Butte. The now-dormant volcano is located south of Arco, and last erupted over 100,000 years ago.\n“For myself, winning the MRCF image competition is really awesome,” Cavell said. “I hope this helps others in our ISU community and beyond the campus become curious about the rocks beneath their feet and think about how they formed and how they got to where they are today. Although geosciences is a rigorous science, I see it as learning and translating the story of the Earth. Each rock, mineral, and process we observe and study is another chapter that is the story of our planet.Rounding out the top three was an image of a banana plant phytolith–a silica-based structure found in some plants– by Rebecca Hazard, and a photo of the inner workings of a mouse pancreas showing blood vessels, insulin-related cells, and more by Brooke Wheeler.\nAdditionally, MRCF and Office for Research staff presented ISU President Robert Wagner and Marty Blair, vice president for research and economic development, with ties emblazoned with images from the competition.\n“Our student researchers have demonstrated exceptional skill in this competition and I'm incredibly proud of their work,” said Wagner. “This competition gave them an opportunity to showcase their talent and participate in the innovative spirit of ISU.”\n“What one ISU student scientist observes under a microscope is now available for all of us to see,” said Blair. “These innovative and creative students are finding unique ways to share and explain their discoveries with us.”The MRCF was created at Idaho State in 1994 and assists researchers spanning the fields of molecular genetics, microbiology, physiology, anatomy, and more from ISU and across the nation in preparing their samples for analysis. It also provides microscopy services using highly specialized microscopes.\nFor more information on Idaho State’s Molecular Research Core Facility, visit isu.edu/mrcf/.\nCategories:",
