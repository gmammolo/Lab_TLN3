  "text": "How to Build the Right Infrastructure for AI\nAI is transforming life as we know it. But the promise of AI will never be realized without a new approach to the underlying infrastructure that supplies the extraordinary compute demands of AI. IDC has crafted a blueprint of key digital infrastructure requirements that can guide platform engineers as they look for answers. A powerful capability that can deliver the results that many are seeking is the ability to rapidly provision GPU clusters automatically for both AI training and inference workloads. It’s a tall order, however, IT decision-makers are finding Vultr technology capable of meeting these demanding requirements.\nSpeakers\nKevin Cochrane\nChief Marketing Officer\nVultr\nChief Marketing Officer\nVultr\nDave McCarthy\nResearch Vice President, Cloud and Edge Infrastructure\nIDC\nResearch Vice President, Cloud and Edge Infrastructure\nIDC\nStan Gibson\nContributing Editor\nCIO Marketing Services\nContributing Editor\nCIO Marketing Services",
