  "text": "Forza Horizon 5 is one more Xbox exclusive that will soon find its way on the rival PlayStation console. The official release date has been revealed, and it is April 25, 2025.\nWhen Forza Horizon 5 was announced for PlayStation 5 in January, player reactions were quite mixed. Fans of great games welcomed the news, seeing it as a step toward ending the pointless console war. Meanwhile, die-hard Xbox and PlayStation loyalists were furious that \"their exclusives\" were making their way to other platforms.\nFollowing the cross-platform releases of Hi-Fi Rush, Crash Bandicoot, and several other former exclusives—along with the announcement that Bethesda’s upcoming Doom: Dark Ages will launch on PlayStation 5—the confirmation of Forza Horizon 5 further reinforces the hope that the landscape of console exclusivity is changing for the better.\nToday, the official announcement came in the form of a trailer on PlayStation's official YouTube channel, revealing Forza Horizon 5 along with its release date: April 25, 2025.\nThe official trailer description reads: \"Dive into Horizon Realms! Explore 12 Evolving Worlds: 11 previously limited-time only locations and the completely new Horizon Stadium Circuit.\"\nThe PlayStation 5 version of Forza Horizon will have some specialties as well, as it is announced. The game will feature PlayStation trophies, in-game badges, and accolades. As it is said, for the first time ever, earning accolades will reward us with various cars, which we'll be able to use later in the game.\nAlso, the description says that we will be able to play the game solo and with friends from all the platforms, meaning Forza Horizon 5 will probably support the cross-play option.\nForza Horizon 5 was originally released back in 2021 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC and was one of the best-rated racing games ever by players and critics alike.\nDON'T MISS!\nPlayStation announced Forza Horizon 5 release date\nPlayStation announced Forza Horizon 5 release date\nForza Horizon 5 is one more Xbox exclusive that will soon find its way on the rival PlayStation console.
