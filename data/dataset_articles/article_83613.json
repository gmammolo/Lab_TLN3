  "text": "How Indianapolis Teaches Ethical AI to Government Workers\nFollowing an internal survey that exposed a significant lack of artificial intelligence policy awareness, Indianapolis and Marion County are providing AI training through a partnership with InnovateUS.\nThe city of Indianapolis and Marion County, Ind., have teamed up with a nonprofit to provide AI training for city and county employees after an internal survey revealed most employees were in the dark about their own agency’s AI policies.\nThe Indianapolis and Marion County partnership will offer free introductory AI training, as well as an internally developed data classification course that needs to be completed in order for employees to qualify for a M365 Copilot license. Copilot is an AI-powered productivity tool integrated into Microsoft applications such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint and can help accomplish tasks like generating emails and reports, creating presentations and analyzing data.\n\"This partnership with InnovateUS establishes a strong foundation for our AI journey, equipping city-county employees with critical knowledge about AI, its potential, challenges, and ethical considerations,\" said Collin Hill, chief information officer for the city of Indianapolis and Marion County, in a\nThe City-County Council conducted an\nThe results revealed that of the more than 600 employees polled, fewer than 19 percent were aware that the city-county had an\nThe survey also revealed that just fewer than half of employees (43 percent) reported having used an AI-driven tool; of that group, about a third (27 percent) admitted to using an AI-driven tool at work.\nEmployees were also asked how they used AI at work, revealing some where using the technology to correspond with residents (17 percent) or run data analysis (22 percent), highlighting the need for comprehensive data security and safety training. A larger portion (28 percent) reported using AI in \"other\" ways with no clear insight into the involvement and data and security in their processes.\nIn late 2023, the City-County Council created the AI Commission to review current AI practices, gather information and make policy recommendations for responsible AI use within Indianapolis and Marion County government agencies.\nMoving forward, the commission has\nInnovateUS, aiming to inform government employees about AI, has worked with several other government agencies includingNew Jersey,MarylandandCaliforniato promote the responsible adoption of AI within government work by prioritizing ethics and clarifying the need for human oversight in AI-driven systems.The Indianapolis and Marion County partnership will offer free introductory AI training, as well as an internally developed data classification course that needs to be completed in order for employees to qualify for a M365 Copilot license.

Additionally, nearly half were not aware of the different levels of data classification, and what types of data are appropriate for use in an AI tool.Employees were also asked how they used AI at work, revealing some where using the technology to correspond with residents (17 percent) or run data analysis (22 percent), highlighting the need for comprehensive data security and safety training.
