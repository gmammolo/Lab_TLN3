  "text": "Image: Maxar Space Systems – Tranche 1 Tracking Layer On-orbit Render. Photo: Business Wire\nMaxar Space Systems delivered the first of 16 spacecraft buses to L3Harris Technologies for the Space Development Agency (SDA)’s Tranche 1 Tracking Layer program, Maxar announced on Feb. 27.\nUsing the Maxar’s 300 platform, the bus was designed to advance the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA). Manufactured in California, the bus was transported to Florida for L3Harris to complete integration and testing before launch.\nThe initial contract between Maxar and L3Harris was established in August 2022 to design and produce spacecraft platforms for SDA’s Tranche 1 Tracking Layer.\nThe Tranche 1 Tracking Layer satellites aim to enhance global detection, warning, and tracking, of conventional and advanced missile threats, including hypersonic missile systems. In addition, Maxar is also designing and manufacturing 18 additional buses for L3Harris for SDA’s Tranche 2 Tracking Layer program .\nMaxar Space Systems CEO Chris Johnson commented: “Successfully delivering this first spacecraft bus underscores the expertise of our team and the trust our partners place in us to help strengthen national security. We’re proud to play a role in advancing innovation and ensuring readiness for the challenges of tomorrow.”",
