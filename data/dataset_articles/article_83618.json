  "text": "We all associate Microsoft Copilot with Windows computers. This is the company’s flagship AI platform, and it’s going to be a big part of Windows going forward. However, it doesn’t mean that it’s locked to Windows, as Microsoft released the Copilot app for Mac computers.\nThis was a pretty surprising bit of news, but it shouldn’t really be. Microsoft is looking to expand Copilot to as many people as possible. SO, this involves putting its AI on competing platforms. Google pushed the Gemini app to iOS, so anything is possible.\nMac computers just got the Copilot app\nThis application won’t exactly grant your computer a ton of on-device AI capabilities. However, it’s great to use if you’re an Apple Mac user and you happen to use Copilot through Bing. Also, it’s perfect if you’re curious about Copilot and you want to see what it’s all about.\nWhen you open the app, it will be a gateway to the web version of Copilot. So, you’ll be able to send prompts, generate images, and more. There won’t really be anything all that different from what you can do on Windows. There are companies working on on-device AI tools that will completely redefine how you use your device. However, there are some applications that just give you quick access to a chatbot. Just like the web version, you can also upload images.\nAccessing the chatbot will be extremely easy, as you’ll be able to summon it via a keyboard shortcut. All you have to do is press Command + Space.\nRight now, Copilot on Mac computers is available in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada. We know that it’s going to make it to more regions.\nSo, this isn’t going to be much different from what you can get from other platforms. Be that as it may, it still brings a pretty powerful experience.",
