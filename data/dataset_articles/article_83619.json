  "text": "Things are looking quite favorable in the crypto market. Aptos’ price has surged to $5.82, thanks to an unofficial community takeover (CTO). Trading activity and buying interest have also increased as the coin continues to capture the attention of influencers. Meanwhile, MNT has reemerged after a short period of dip, with the latest Mantle price analysis hinting at a smooth upward path.\nAdding to the excitement, BlockDAG (BDAG), which has raised over $199 million in presale with over 18.6 billion coins sold, is set to list on 10 major Centralized Exchanges (CEXs). These highly awaited listings are set to boost its current batch 27 price of $0.0248 per coin to a whopping $20 by 2027, unlocking massive ROIs for holders who join the network’s presale now!\nCommunity Takeover Triggers Aptos Price Surge\nFollowing a recent Aptos price surge, APT is currently residing at $5.82. And guess what triggered it? An unofficial community takeover (CTO) led by crypto influencer BuzzlamicJihad. Most community takeover happens with abandoned projects, but Aptos is actively being developed.\nThe CTO started in October 2024, with people using memes and catchphrases like “Aptos lookin’ good here,” which spiked social media engagement and buying interest. This Aptos price surge comes after hitting a low of $5.50, a price level strongly defended by buyers. Trading activity has spiked by 13.42% and continues to get a great deal of attention from influencers. And the new CEO, Avery Ching is in full support of this, referring to BuzzlamicJihad as the “GOAT.”\nMantle Price Analysis: What’s Next After a 3.76% Surge?\nDespite a brief dip, Mantle (MNT) has rebounded, showcasing resilience with a 3.76% price increase and $121.4 million in trading volume over the past 24 hours. With a market cap of $3.557 billion, and market dominance of 0.1157%, Mantle is slowly but surely marking its presence in the crypto world.\nAdditionally, Mantle’s price analysis signals the potential for continued growth, with SMA and RSI supporting this possibility. If Mantle holds firm against the resistance level of $1.2730, it could soar high and set new records.\nBlockDAG’s CEX Listings Near—Here’s What $20 Forecast Means for Holders\nThere is hardly a way that a crypto enthusiast hasn’t heard about BlockDAG. This emerging altcoin giant has been garnering consistent institutional confidence since its presale began—raising $199 million and selling over 18.6 billion coins, marking its position as a breakout crypto of this year.\nNow, things are about to take an exciting new turn for BlockDAG buyers as the coin prepares to launch on 10 major Centralized Exchanges (CEXs). Having made an impressive mark in the crypto world already, BDAG will likely witness mass adoption once it lists on these exchanges, expanding its reach to millions of traders worldwide. This widespread adoption will also significantly boost the credibility and liquidity of the coin, as the BDAG community expands.\nThe price of BlockDAG has already seen impressive growth so far, experiencing a 2380% jump since its first crypto presale batch. But the real game is just about to begin. The coin is currently priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27 and once it launches its mainnet in 2025, its price is set to surge significantly, potentially even reaching $20 by 2027.\nThese numbers highlight how quickly BDAG is growing, with no signs of slowing down. This message is perfectly captured in the network’s newly released CGI video, where a laser shoots into the sky—a metaphor for BDAG’s ambition to go beyond limits, aiming for the sky—or perhaps even the Moon!\nDecision Time\nThe Aptos price surge continues to gain steam, with an increase in traction on social media and buying interest. Meanwhile, Mantle is establishing a presence in the crypto market, with a market dominance of 0.1157%. To make things better for Mantle, price analysis suggests continued bullish momentum for the coin.\nWhile established players see an upward trend, BlockDAG, which has raised over $199 million across just 27 presale batches, is set to accelerate its journey by listing on 10 major CEXs. While early adopters of this breakout crypto are already seeing a 2380% price surge, listing on CEXs could further take its price to $20 in the next two years. So for crypto enthusiasts looking for the next big thing, BlockDAG is the perfect opportunity—especially while it’s still priced at just $0.0248 per coin!\nDisclaimer: TheNewsCrypto does not endorse any content on this page.
