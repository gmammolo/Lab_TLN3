You can upload images, generate images and text, use the shortcut launcher, dark mode, and try Think Deeper.\nMicrosoft Copilot is the AI companion for everyday life. Talking with Copilot is an easy way to learn, grow and gain confidence, all with the help of the OpenAI and Microsoft AI models.\nTalk to your AI assistant and get a fresh perspective on your ideas. Use Copilot as a space to air your thoughts and get the support you need, when you need it.\nWhile there are no in-app purchases in the Microsoft Copilot, it does offer both free and paid service tiers Users can pay $20 per month to have access to the latest AI models.\nThe Microsoft Copilot app is a free download from the Mac App Store .
