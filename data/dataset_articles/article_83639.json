  "text": "Split the difference A Google Chrome Canary beta build has revealed a new split-screen feature\nIt's been updated twice and renamed since it was first discovered\nIt's not available to the public yet, but is expected to release soon\nThe latest beta build of Google Chrome features brand-new split-screen functionality. This feature lets you use two windows in a single tab and even dynamically change the size of the windows for enhanced productivity.\nUncovered by X user Leopeva64, the new Google Chrome split-screen feature appears to be now known as \"Show side-by-side\". However, it was first available in the drop-down menu as \"Split tab with active tab\".\nNaming conventions aside, the functionality is identical between the two beta updates; you can merge two windows in the browser under one larger tab, and then you're able to resize the two sides, which means you won't have to manually drag two windows snapped together or swap tabs out.\nWhile confirmed to not be fully functional yet, plans are in place for the handle (space between the tabs) to be resizable as well. With a larger dividing gap, you can better separate the two tabs or minimize the gap completely for a seamless encompassing…\nAleksha McLoughlin",
