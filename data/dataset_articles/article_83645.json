Now, the studio has released a revised roadmap that gets much more specific.\nFirst up, a major update is coming on May 8th. 11 bit simply says this update will \"adjust the City's management, paying homage to the order established by the first New Londoners\". How mysterious!\nAs well as the major new update and the console port release timing, 11 bit studios also announced a broad release window for Frostpunk 2's first DLC Spectrum. It's launching in fall, apparently.\nUnfortunately, both the Aurora DLC and Frostpunk 2's as-yet-unnamed third major expansion still don't have release windows more specific than this year and next, respectively, but at least we know roughly when the first one's coming.\nWhen Frostpunk 2 does arrive on consoles, it'll be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.
