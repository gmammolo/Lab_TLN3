  "text": "Publisher Reef Entertainment and developer Bitmap Bureau have announced Terminator 2D: No Fate, a gritty sidescroller in which you must put a stop to the T-1000 and foil Skynet's plans before the human race is destroyed.\nThe game will allow you to play as either Sarah Connor or Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 as you fight to stop the shapeshifting android, memorably played by Robert Patrick in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (and in the\nupcoming Mortal Kombat 1 DLC).\nTerminator 2D: No Fate's story will blend \"iconic scenes\" from the aforementioned Terminator 2 with \"original scenarios and multiple endings\", which sounds like a rather unique mixture.\nIn the trailer, we can see Terminator 2 scenes like Sarah Connor working out in her hospital room, Arnie's T-800 duking it out with thugs in a dingy bar, and, of course, that iconic truck chase sequence.\nWe also see how the gameplay will work, and it looks like Terminator 2D: No Fate will take on a sort of Contra-style run-and-gun feel; we can see Connor snap-aiming in various directions, Contra-style, as well as lots of fast-paced action rendered in crisp pixel art.\nOverall, Terminator...",
