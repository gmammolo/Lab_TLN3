  "text": "Expanded MURR facility aims to attract global nuclear medicine experts to Columbia by Ryan Smith\nWed, April 2nd 2025 at 6:11 PM 6 VIEW ALL PHOTOS \"MURR is developing new radioisotopes for the latest cancer treatments, finding ways to ensure those isotopes can be delivered to specific cancer cells. And these technologies are changing how cancers are being treated, and we are saving lives daily.\" (KRCG) TOPICS:\nMURR Nuclear medicine Research reactor Radioactive isotopes Cancer treatments University of Missouri Collaboration Lutetium 177 The highest-powered university research reactor in the country is expanding.\nOfficials held a ribbon cutting today at the research reactor north building, dubbed \"MURR West.\"\n\"In our entire history, nearly 60 years. We came online in 1966. This is by far the largest expansion we have ever had. We must continue discovering new radioactive isotopes and helping industry partners commercialize them and get them to patients,” explained Matt Sandford, the executive director of the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR).\nThe $20 million three-story expansion will provide much-needed space for researchers at the MURR facility and increase opportunities for collaboration with industry partners.\n\"The people that work here are experts and respected worldwide for what they can do. And what the researchers need most right now is space to do the research, more experiments, and more partnerships to develop these technologies,” Sanford said.\nMURR focuses on research, medical isotope production, and advancing nuclear medicine.\n\"MURR is developing new radioisotopes for the latest cancer treatments, finding ways to ensure those isotopes can be delivered to specific cancer cells. And these technologies are changing how cancers are being treated, and we are saving lives daily,\" Sanford said.\nSanford says the facility's demand has increased due to recent regulation changes by the FDA allowing more drugs to use Lutetium 177, a radioactive isotope produced at MURR.\n“We are expanding those technologies to new research and production to those isotopes here at the University of Missouri,” Sanford said.\nWith \"MURR West\" now complete, Sanford hopes to bring some of the world's top experts in advancing nuclear medicine to Columbia.\n\"Now that this building is complete, they'll be interested in coming here and partnering with the experts at MURR and the University of Missouri to help bring their new technologies to life,\" Sanford said.\nStay Connected Like Us Follow Us sbg-envelope\nNewsletter Sign up /sign-up\n© 2025 Sinclair, Inc.
