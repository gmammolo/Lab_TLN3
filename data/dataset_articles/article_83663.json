  "text": "New research suggests that getting vaccinated against shingles might offer protection against dementia.\nShingles is a a painful and debilitating condition that occurrs in people who have had chickenpox, when the varicella zoster virus — which causes both conditions — reactivates in the body.\nThe new research, published Wednesday in Nature, analysed data from more than 280,000 older adults in Wales and found people who received the original shingles live virus vaccine were 20 per cent less likely to develop dementia of any type than those who were not vaccinated.\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\nPrevious research has found an association between the Shingrix shingles vaccine, which replaced the live virus version in 2020, and a lower risk of dementia, especially in women.\nBut that link wasn’t considered as strong because that study design couldn’t account for potential differences between those who were vaccinated and those who were not, such as the possibility that the vaccinated people might have been healthier overall.\nShingrix, which targets a tiny bit of viral DNA, turned out to have a longer lasting effect than the original vaccine.\nThe new study was possible because of an unusual public health policy in Wales that provided a “natural experiment” to explore the potential impact of the vaccine on dementia risk.\nThe rollout of the vaccine in Wales on September 1, 2013, was offered to people who were 79 on that date, but not to people who had turned 80.\nThat allowed the German and Stanford University researchers to compare two groups of people with similar health characteristics who differed only by one week in age.\nThis meant the two groups were essentially the same except the vaccine was available to the younger population but not the older, Stanford University assistant professor of medicine, and a senior author of the study, Dr Pascal Geldsetzer said.\nWhat’s exciting about the study is that it’s essentially like a randomised controlled trial, considered the gold standard in research, he said.\n‘A pretty strong effect’\nThe way the original vaccine was rolled out in Wales provided a unique opportunity, Columbia University Aging Centre professor of epidemiology Allison Aiello said.\n“It’s like having a control group compared to a treated group,” Aiello, who was not associated with the new research, said.\n“What’s interesting is the finding of 20 per cent protection. That is a pretty strong effect, which does fit with other research suggesting that herpes viruses might have an influence on dementia.”\nScientists don’t know exactly how the chickenpox virus raises the risk of dementia.\nIt’s been shown that reactivation of the virus can lead to the accumulation of aberrant proteins associated with Alzheimer’s, for example, Geldsetzer said.\nIt’s also possible that the virus might spark a reactivation of herpes simplex, which earlier research has linked to dementia.\nHerpes viruses never completely go away but instead lurk in the body until the immune system weakens.\nAgeing leads to a natural weakening of the immune system that can allow the virus to resurface as shingles, a nasty side effect of chickenpox.\nThe age effect is why the shingles vaccine has been offered only to people age 50 and older in the US. It’s given as two doses, two to six months apart.\nHerpes viruses, including oral and genital herpes simplex, appear to have the ability to get into the central nervous system, experts said.\nIn fact, a 2024 study found among 70-year-olds without dementia at the outset, older adults with a herpes simplex diagnosis were more than twice as likely as uninfected people to develop dementia over a 15-year follow-up.\nHerpes simplex can wreak havoc if it passes through the blood-brain barrier. It can cause inflammation of both the meninges (meningitis) and the brain (encephalitis). Both can be fatal.\nNot the first study, but limitations exist\nBolstering the case for the shingles vaccine protecting against dementia were the findings from a study published in Nature Medicine in 2024 that analysed medical records from more than 100,000 patients.\nThat analysis suggested the newer shingles vaccine was associated with even better protection against dementia.\nIn that study, researchers also investigated whether two other vaccines — for influenza and tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis — had any impact on the risk for dementia. They did not.\nDr Aarati Didwania, a professor of medicine and medical education at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, said that the most important take-home message from the Stanford study is that getting vaccinated might lower the risk for dementia, said\nExactly how the vaccines might protect against dementia isn’t clear, Didwania said. “But it’s an intriguing question,” she added. “Is it by decreasing inflammation or preventing the virus from reactivating?”\nThere’s certainly a good reason for getting vaccinated, Didwania said.\n“Shingles is a terrible, painful and debilitating condition that can lead to horrendous long-term pain,” she said.\nThere are limitations to the new study.\nWhile it indicates the benefit of the vaccine in a real-world setting, it’s not the same as a randomised controlled trial, Vanderbilt University Medical Centre professor of infectious diseases Dr William Schaffner said.\nBut it wouldn’t be ethical to randomly assign people to get the vaccine or not, he said.\n“It’s provocative, interesting and exciting,” he said of the research.\nIt’s possible that the US Food and Drug Administration could review research linking shingles vaccines to a lower risk of dementia and allow the drug company to add that indication to the label, Schaffner said.\nEven if that doesn’t happen, doctors can use the study findings to convince patients to choose to be vaccinated.\n“Clearly there are lots of people 50 and over who have not received the vaccine,” he said.\n“If you say there are some data that suggest the vaccine might prevent some cases of dementia, people might be persuaded.”\nStream free on",
