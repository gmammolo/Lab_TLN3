  "text": "A recent Samsung workshop gave me an up-close look at the company's 2025 Neo QLED TV lineup, and I walked away impressed. Kerry Wan/ZDNET\nThe TV launch season is upon us, and Samsung is among the first brands to put out its 2025 lineup of visual goodness. I recently had the opportunity to scope out some new TVs at one of Samsung's satellite laboratories in New Jersey, putting every upcoming model through the ringer and seeing just how well they stack up to the company's early-year claims.\nAlso: I spent hours testing Samsung's new flagship soundbar - it gave my Sonos a run for its money\nBelow are my initial takeaways (read: this isn't a review) on the company's Neo QLED 4K and 8K models, which are up for preorder now, as well as the new Vision AI features that underpin the 2025 viewing experience.\nSamsung's 'Vision AI' is hard to deny\nKerry Wan/ZDNET\nUnsurprisingly, a major emphasis at the workshop was Samsung's latest artificial intelligence tech, Vision AI, which is integrated into all the company's new TVs. While Vision AI's capabilities span the user experience, from browsing and searching to watching foreign movies, the following caught my attention the most.\nReal-time subtitle translations\nAre you a fan of foreign films? Sometimes, the most obscure (and best) international movies lack English subtitles. Vision AI is a near-instant translator for seven different languages on new Samsung TVs. While this isn't necessarily a new feature in tech -- several Android smartphones, including Samsung's own, already support live transcriptions -- the ability to do this from the comfort of your couch or bed is very useful.\nAlso: Having trouble hearing whispery TV dialogue? I found 3 ways to fix that\nWe have good reason to believe that number will expand after future updates since Samsung's latest mobile devices already support translation of 13 languages through its \"Live Translate\" feature.\nOnscreen 'Click to Search'\nI often find myself pausing a show to look up information on my iPhone to identify an actor, a set's filming location, or a song playing in the background.…\nChris Bayer",
