  "text": "Andrea and Leo\nAndrea & Leo couture is a premier dress designer based in Los Angeles, California. They have over 200,000 gowns in stock for all special occasions including homecoming, prom, cocktail and formal evening wear events. They also specialize in wedding looks, including [mother of the bride](https://www.newyorkdress.com/collections/mother-of-the-bride) and bridesmaid designs. They pride themselves on their vast selection, impeccable silhouettes and stunning fabric and color combinations. Andrea & Leo gowns focus on elegance and dazzle for each and every woman, with varied price points in order to reach as many women as possible.\nWhimsy & Romance\nThe couture house of Andrea & Leo have been creating fabulous, fashionable gowns since 2006. Their unique style focuses on everyday whimsy and soft romance. Many Andrea & Leo dresses feature designs inspired by the natural world. Soft petal and ornamental blossoms are stitched along bodies and into the skirts of flowy dresses. Their dresses also feature delicate brocade or lace work, adding a vintage romance into many of their more ornate pieces.\nCouture Colors\nAndrea & Leo couture collections come in an array of colors, spanning the entire spectrum from pastels to hot pinks. Perhaps their color choices could best be broken down into three categories: nude with exquisite detailing, pastels with classic forms and vibrant colors in bolder designs.\nTheir nude-colored dresses with intricate beadwork draw the eye to an elongated female form. The color is minimal and elegant and timeless enough for any occasion, whether its prom, a cocktail party or a black-tie event. The highly-detailed beading and crystal work also creates flattering patterns across the bodice, neckline and flowing parts of the dress.\nOf course, Andrea & Leo dresses take the nude look a bit more colorful with a range of pastel options. Their pastel palette features gorgeous petal pinks, dove greys, cornflower blues, pale peaches and demure golds. These dresses are often in classic forms such as A-lines and sheaths, hugging the body at the bodice then flowing more loosely further down the legs.\nThe designs at Andrea & Leo couture also include bolder colors for those looking to stand out. The color palette here ranges from jewel tones such as emerald and ruby and sapphire, to hot pinks. No matter what color you’re looking for, Andrea & Leo dresses are sure to have an option which will suit you perfectly.\nStyles for Every Shape\nAndrea & Leo gowns come in all shapes, cut to flatter the female figure. Their full catalog of dress options include the ever-popular and immensely flattering sweetheart neckline as well as sexy deep-V necklines. For those looking for something a bit different, straight across, high and halter necklines are available as well. Their dresses also feature many varied types of straps, including fine spaghetti straps, off-the-shoulder and sleeveless options for women looking to flaunt their shoulders and arms. Cap sleeve and long sleeves are available as well for looks that are elongated and demure.\nAs for body shapes, Andrea & Leo gowns truly cater to every feminine form. Their collections feature many A-line dresses which are excellent for drawing the eye to the smallest part of the frame and helping to create the illusion of curves. Trumpet and mermaid style hemlines are also popular, adding volume to the bottom of the dress in order to balance out fuller figures or just add that unique flair. Ball gowns with beautiful skirts are also popular, creating romantic silhouettes perfect for any formal occasion.\nFind the Perfect Andrea & Leo for You\nAndrea & Leo dresses are available in over 200,000 styles in their Los Angeles store. However, for those farther away, looking for their perfect Andrea & Leo gown, NewYorkDress is the answer.
