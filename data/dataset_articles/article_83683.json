  "text": "The Webb Space Telescope has captured pictures of the asteroid that caused a stir earlier this year when it topped Earth’s hit list.\nDiscovered late last year, the asteroid 2024 YR4 was predicted at one point to have a 3% chance of smacking Earth in 2032.\nAdditional observations prompted scientists to reduce the threat to virtually zero, where it remains.\nBut there is a slight chance it could hit the Moon then.\nThe asteroid swings our way every four years.\nNasa and the European Space Agency released the photos – showing the asteroid as a fuzzy dot – on Wednesday.\nWebb confirmed the asteroid is nearly 200ft (60 metres) across, or about the height of a 15-storey building, according to the two space agencies.\nIt is the smallest object ever observed by the observatory, the biggest and most powerful ever sent into space.\nJohns Hopkins University astronomer Andrew Rivkin said the observations by Webb served as “invaluable” practice for other asteroids that may threaten us down the road.\nGround telescopes have also tracked this particular space rock over the past few months.\nAll this “gives us a window to understand what other objects the size of 2024 YR4 are like, including the next one that might be heading our way”, Mr Rivkin, who helped with the observations, said in a statement.\nHouse Rules\nWe do not moderate comments, but we expect readers to adhere to certain rules in the interests of open and accountable debate.\nRead the rules here\nYou must verify your phone number before you can comment.\nPlease enter your phone number below, and a verification code will be sent to you by text message.\nPlease enter the six-digit verification code sent to you by SMS.\n[Didn’t receive a code?
