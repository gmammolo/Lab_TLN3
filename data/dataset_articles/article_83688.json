  "text": "The ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition is a new take on the iconic workhorse line, with a new design concept and features aimed at MacBook users. ZDNET's key takeaways Lenovo's first-edition ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition 14-inch is available now, starting at $1,239 for the lowest-tier configuration.\nIt's an experimental evolution of the ThinkPad line, exchanging some of the most defining features for a new sleek form factor and bold design.\nThe entry configuration only comes with 256GB of storage, which is not sufficient for a laptop in this price range. View now at Lenovo\nWhen I first saw Lenovo's ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition at CES in January of 2025, I praised its bold design elements -- a striking departure from the norms of the ThinkPad line. There's no TrackPoint, a noticeable lack of I/O, and a minimalist trackpad that looks nothing like the X1 Carbon -- its (significantly more expensive) older sibling.\nNow that I've been using it for a few weeks, it's become one of my favorite laptops of the year for its versatility, brilliant display, and fantastic battery. In a sense, the X9 Aura Edition is a ThinkPad that has evolved to a new form, keeping some of what we love about the iconic lineup but elaborating on a new vision, as well.\nAlso: After years with Windows, I used the MacBook Air M4 for one week. Here's how it went\nBut I should also mention that there is some friction here. First, if you're a ThinkPad enjoyer, it's easy to feel like Lenovo is abandoning the line's core features, but the X9 Aura Edition seems to be more of an experiment than a sweeping redefinition of the flagship family.\nThere's an obvious resemblance to the MacBook, and the Aura Edition features are definitely engineered to speak to the Apple user (or refugee). I've covered them extensively since the tap-to-share functionality spurred hordes of participants to slam their smartphones against the first Aura Edition laptops last year, and they're all still here, but more like bonus features rather than flagship headliners.\nBesides photo and file sharing capabilities designed to mirror Apple's AirDrop experience, Aura Edition laptops…\nKyle Kucharski",
