  "text": "CyberQP, a leading provider of access management solutions, has launched its Zero Trust Helpdesk Security Platform—combining QGuard for Privileged Access Management (PAM) and QDesk for End-User Access Management (EUAM). This unified solution helps IT teams reduce risk, improve efficiency, and eliminate standing privileges across the organization.\nGame-Changing Access Control\nA key innovation of the platform is End-User Elevation , which allows users to gain temporary admin access without persistent privileges. By automating approval processes and monitoring activity in real-time, CyberQP dramatically reduces attack surfaces while maintaining security and compliance.\n“We built this platform to address major security gaps caused by always-on access,” said Mateo Barraza, CEO & Co-Founder of CyberQP. “With QGuard and QDesk, businesses can finally enforce true Zero Trust principles across their environments.”\nPlatform Highlights\nJust-in-Time Access: Grant technicians and users time-limited access only when needed—no standing privileges, no exposed passwords. Credential Rotation: Automatically rotate credentials to prevent stale logins and reduce vulnerability to attacks. Self-Service Tools: End users can reset passwords and manage accounts without technician intervention, cutting down ticket volume and costs. Helpdesk Verification: Instantly verify user identities to prevent social engineering and fraud. Comprehensive Visibility: A unified dashboard delivers insights across privileged and end-user access activity. CyberQP integrates with PSA platforms including ConnectWise, Datto Autotask, and Halo PSA, and meets key compliance and cyber insurance requirements with SOC 2 Type 2 certification.\nAvailability\nThe CyberQP Zero Trust Helpdesk Security Platform is available now.
