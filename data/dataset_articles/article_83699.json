  "text": "The best part? This long-awaited feature works with Firefox's popular new Vertical Tabs layout. Mozilla / Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET\nMove over, Chrome. Watch out, Edge. Firefox has finally caught up with the competition courtesy of a helpful new skill.\nNow baked into the latest version of Mozilla's browser is the long-awaited Tab Groups. Yes, that means you can organize related web pages into specific groups to keep track of them more easily and prevent the Tab bar from getting too crowded.\nHow to use Tab Groups in Firefox\nTo use Tab Groups, make sure you are running Firefox version 137 or higher. To check, click the hamburger icon at the upper right, select Help and then click About Firefox. The latest version automatically downloads and installs, prompting you to restart the browser.\nAlso: The Firefox I loved is gone - how to protect your privacy on it now\nFor now, the new feature is still in the rollout phase, which means it is not available to all Firefox users yet. Give it a few days and it should eventually pop up. OK, but how do you actually use Tab Groups?\nOpen two or more related web pages, maybe some stories on ZDNET. Move the tab of one page on top of the other. If the Tab Groups option is accessible, the tab you are moving takes on a dark blue border. At that point, let go of your mouse button or touchpad. A small \"Create tab group\" window prompts you to name the group and assign a color. After you have done both, tap Done.\nYou then see a tab with the name and color you assigned. Select the tab to open the group and see the web pages inside. Select it again to close the group. With the group open, simply click on each…\nLance Whitney",
