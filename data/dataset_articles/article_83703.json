  "text": "ORONO — The University of Maine celebrated a milestone Wednesday with the opening of its new robotic cow milking facility.\nLocated at Witter Farm on the university’s Orono campus, the facility is only the third of its kind in Maine.\nAccording to a study conducted by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, the rising cost of labor and supplies—combined with flatlining revenue—has forced many dairy farms across the state to close.\nWitter Farm Superintendent Patricia Henderson said robotic milking machines could help address this issue.\n“Do we pay our grain bill or do we pay our employees this month? And this is really going to help those farms understand the investment in robotics and how to help bridge that gap in their challenges,” said Henderson.\nHenderson said the machine works by allowing cows to choose when they’re milked.\n“She walks into the stanchion. It will ID her by her ear tag. And it will know exactly who it is, how much milk she’s making, what she did, you know, six hours before, and exactly where the teat placement is on her udder,” said Henderson.\nMary Castonguay, an Organic Valley dairy farmer and board member of the Maine Dairy Industry Association, agrees the new technology will help address the labor shortage.\n“It’s hard to find good, reliable help. And a lot of farms are turning to robots for milking,” said Castonguay.\nThe new facility also benefits students involved in the program, who were previously tasked with milking the university’s 35 cows twice a day. Now, they can focus on skills that will be more beneficial for their careers.\n“Rather than our students doing actual milking and all the labor-intensive parts of the dairy farm, now they get to learn the robotics side of it, which is going to help them for future careers and stuff because, obviously, the industry is going robotic. So we’re going to need to train people who know and understand robotics if this is the industry they want to go into,” said Henderson.\nHenderson said they anticipate giving the cows 24-hour access to the machine will increase milk productivity by about 15 percent.\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Alex Schley Reporter\nAuthor email Follow Alex Schley Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!
