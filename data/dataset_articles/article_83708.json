  "text": "CyberQP Releases Groundbreaking Zero Trust Helpdesk Security Platform to Eliminate Standing Privileges\nCyberQP Releases Groundbreaking Zero Trust Helpdesk Security Platform to Eliminate Standing Privileges\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CyberQP, a leading provider of access management solutions, has launched its Zero Trust Helpdesk Security Platform—combining QGuard for Privileged Access Management (PAM) and QDesk for End-User Access Management (EUAM). This unified solution helps IT teams reduce risk, improve efficiency, and eliminate standing privileges across the organization.\nEliminate Standing Privileges and Secure Your Helpdesk with CyberQP's Zero Trust Platform.\n[Share]\nGame-Changing Access Control\nA key innovation of the platform is End-User Elevation, which allows users to gain temporary admin access without persistent privileges. By automating approval processes and monitoring activity in real-time, CyberQP dramatically reduces attack surfaces while maintaining security and compliance.\n“We built this platform to address major security gaps caused by always-on access,” said Mateo Barraza, CEO & Co-Founder of CyberQP. “With QGuard and QDesk, businesses can finally enforce true Zero Trust principles across their environments.”\nPlatform Highlights\n- Just-in-Time Access: Grant technicians and users time-limited access only when needed—no standing privileges, no exposed passwords.\n- Credential Rotation: Automatically rotate credentials to prevent stale logins and reduce vulnerability to attacks.\n- Self-Service Tools: End users can reset passwords and manage accounts without technician intervention, cutting down ticket volume and costs.\n- Helpdesk Verification: Instantly verify user identities to prevent social engineering and fraud.\n- Comprehensive Visibility: A unified dashboard delivers insights across privileged and end-user access activity.\nCyberQP integrates with PSA platforms including ConnectWise, Datto Autotask, and Halo PSA, and meets key compliance and cyber insurance requirements with SOC 2 Type 2 certification.\nAvailability\nThe CyberQP Zero Trust Helpdesk Security Platform is available now. For more information or to request a demo, visit www.cyberqp.com.\nAbout CyberQP\nCyberQP simplifies access management by eliminating standing privileges and enabling secure, efficient workflows for IT teams.
