  "text": "New Nintendo games revealed for the Switch brings new entries to the Mario Kart and Donkey Kong franchises, while changing up the formula.\nDuring this morning’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, gamers got a look at a bunch of ports (and Switch enhanced titles) coming to the new console. But we also got two entirely new games from the company’s stable of franchises thanks to Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza .\nWhile getting new games in these series are great, it’s more exciting to see Nintendo is pushing them to do something different from what we’ve expected. Mario Kart World is taking the beloved racing franchise into an open-world setting, while Donkey Kong has a fresh look and making a long-awaited return to 3D platforming!\nPut the pedal to the metal in Mario Kart World, a brand-new experience set in a vast interconnected environment. Race seamlessly across connected courses that deliver Mario Kart racing like never before. Twenty-four drivers can compete in a race. Participate in the new Knockout Tour mode, where you’ll barrel through back-to-back courses and checkpoints, with no pit stops along the way. If a player doesn’t make it to each checkpoint at a high-enough placement, they will be eliminated. And in Free Roam, it’s possible to go off the racetrack and drive in any direction you wish, explore areas that pique your interest and take some photos at scenic spots with a group of friends.\nGet ready for Donkey Kong Bananza, a brand-new 3D platforming action adventure – available exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2. Crash, bash, and climb through nearly everything in DK’s path and tear off chunks of terrain to swing around and throw in groundbreaking exploration. The more that is demolished with powerful punches, the more areas open up to discover.\nMario Kart World will be a launch title for the system (June 5th) and even getting a special, focused Nintendo Direct in a couple weeks (April 17th). Donkey Kong Bananza will arrive the following month on July 17th.",
