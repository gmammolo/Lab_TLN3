  "text": "Donkey Kong is getting a makeover. As spotted in the first fleeting Mario Kart World glimpses fans saw in the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal teaser from January , DK has a new design. This fresh look was revealed in full during today’s Nintendo Direct when the gorilla’s new game, Donkey Kong Bananza , was shown off. It’ll launch on Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17, 2025. Give it a glimpse:\nDonkey Kong Bananza is the character’s first 3D platformer since 1999’s Donkey Kong 64 . It’s been 26 years, but fans will finally be able to take the character into a fresh adventure in the third dimension. For this escapade, DK will be able to smash through a destructible underground environment. It seems that demolishing DK’s surroundings is a big part of exploration in Bananza .\nSpeaking of his new look… When DK made his debut on the silver screen in The Super Mario Bros. Movie , he was noticeably different looking than in the games. Miyamoto attributed this during a Nintendo Direct broadcast for the film to wanting to make DK a more “comical personality” and to give him a “design reminiscent of the original character.” That look has apparently been adapted and carried over to Mario Kart World and DK Bananza . This writer is a bit torn, but it’s growing on me. But what do you think, dear readers? Let us know your thoughts on the redesign and the game down below!\nSource: Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 Broadcast 04.02.25",
