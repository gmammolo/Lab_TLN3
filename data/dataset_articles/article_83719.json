  "text": "KITCHENER, ON / ACCESS Newswire / April 2, 2025 / Vitaliti Technologies Inc. has officially launched with a transformative healthcare platform that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to power a unique remote patient monitoring (RPM) ecosystem. Founded in Vancouver, Canada, this multi-award-winning company provides solutions designed to improve patient care, reduce costs, and make healthcare delivery easier for everyone involved.\nVitaliti Platform Currently valued at $3 million CAD, Vitaliti offers investors an exciting opportunity. The company already has paying customers and strong partnerships. With proven technology and a clear path for growth, Vitaliti stands out in the quickly expanding field of virtual care powered by artificial intelligence.\nMeeting the Growing Need for Virtual Care\nThe demand for virtual healthcare services is growing rapidly. As populations age, more people are living with chronic illnesses and recovering from complex surgeries. Traditional healthcare systems in North America struggle to provide timely and efficient care to everyone. Vitaliti Technologies AI takes in data from remote patient monitoring devices and delivers clinical decision-support solutions that can autonomously predict poor surgical outcomes, improve medication adherence, and screen for deadly respiratory diseases.\nWorking together, Vitaliti software and proprietary medical devices are designed to reduce hospital length of stay after surgery, medication errors, post-surgical complications, and deaths. Readmissions and ER visits are also reduced, making care much more efficient. Doctors respond with high satisfaction scores and word-of-mouth referrals.\nProven to Perform and Easy to Use\nVitaliti's technology isn't just promising; it's scientifically proven. Independent studies show that their RPM system performs better than competitors' products. Patients also like using it. High patient satisfaction means users trust the technology, leading to higher compliance and better overall results.\nThe company's commitment to research and development is evident in the 14 patents it holds, 8 of which are specifically related to AI applications. Additional patents in the United States and around the world are pending.\nLeading the Industry Through Innovation\nVitaliti Technologies is recognized as a Canadian leader in AI and virtual care. They have been named Startup of the Year for Innovation and earned Canada's first-ever XPRIZE, along with an Edison Award, Fast Company's \"World Changing Idea,\" and a 2022 Top Innovator Award from Canadian Business. These awards confirm the forward-looking nature of Vitaliti's technology.\nReal-World Impact and Global Reach\nVitaliti Technologies is currently powering the Vision-2 global clinical study of up to 20,000 patients at McMaster University's Population Health Research Institute. This large-scale research project focuses on improving patient outcomes after surgery. Academic partnerships allow Vitaliti to prove the value of its products on the road to regulatory approval.\nGenerating Revenue and Growing Quickly\nUnlike most technology startups, Vitaliti is generating revenue from Day One. As part of the Vision-2 project, they have secured contracts to supply their platform to 8 hospitals in 4 countries so far. This immediate success proves there's a strong demand for Vitaliti's AI technology.\nLooking ahead, Vitaliti is set for rapid growth. The company expects revenues to grow from approximately $450,000 in 2025 to a profitable $3 million by 2027. New partnerships and large contracts planned for the near future will help accelerate this growth.\nA Unique Investment Opportunity\nFor investors interested in the rapidly growing fields of AI and machine learning, Vitaliti Technologies presents an appealing opportunity. With its modest current valuation, investors have the chance to get in early with a proven, successful company.\nVitaliti Technologies blends award-winning products, scientific validation, and satisfied customers to redefine healthcare. By investing now, backers can become part of a company that not only addresses today's healthcare challenges but also shapes the future of medical care.\nAbout Vitaliti Technologies Inc.\nVitaliti Technologies Inc. is a medical AI company that specializes in remote patient monitoring (RPM) and automated healthcare solutions. Located in Vancouver, BC, Canada, the company was founded by Robert Kaul, Dr. Gaurav Puri, and Dr. Constantine Zachos.\nCompany Information\nCompany Name : Vitaliti Technologies Inc.\nWebsite : https://vitalititech.com/\nEmail : robert.kaul@vitalititech.com\nAddress : 202-72 Victoria St. South Kitchener, ON N2G 4Y9 Canada\nSOURCE: Vitaliti Technologies Inc.\nView the original press release on ACCESS Newswire\nStock Quote API & Stock News API supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nand .",
