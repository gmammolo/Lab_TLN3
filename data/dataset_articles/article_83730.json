  "text": "Content creators reign supreme in today’s digital world, driving trends and shaping culture with vogue ideas and engaging content. From viral videos to chart-topping music, the internet has become a playground for talent, offering limitless opportunities for individuals to share their creations with the world.\nYet, behind this seemingly democratized ecosystem lies a complex web of challenges that often leave creators struggling to reap the full rewards of their labor. Numerous layers of intermediaries and platforms take a significant cut of earnings, and the threat of unauthorized use and piracy frequently leaves creators shortchanged and vulnerable.\nBut what if there was a new platform that changes how creators share their content — one that’s truly safe and financially beneficial? This is what California-based technology company Teklium is delivering with its new content creation platform , EQC One.\nEQC One, founded by Jason Ho, aims to transform online interactions between content creators and digital talents. The platform seeks to create a more equitable and progressive internet environment. It empowers creators by confirming they receive proper recognition and fair compensation, while also protecting their content.\nContent Creation: What is the Problem? The need for EQC One stems from the inherent problems plaguing the current content creation field. While the internet has undoubtedly democratized content creation, it has also introduced challenges that undermine the value and integrity of creators’ work.\nMany creators lose up to 70% or more of their earnings to platform fees, with multiple layers of platforms, distributors, and intermediaries taking a significant portion of the profits. Moreover, the widespread availability also risks their work being duplicated and misused without permission.\nTeklium recognizes these challenges and aims to find a solution with EQC One. The platform is built on a vision of a progressive internet that prioritizes creators and younger generations over dominant entities. Ho explains, “The internet should be a place where talent thrives without interference from algorithms or exploitation by larger players. EQC One is our way of giving creators the tools they need to succeed on their own terms.”\nThe Solution: How EQC One Works EQC One operates on a foundation of inventive technologies and principles designed to build a secure and equitable ecosystem for content creation. At its core, the platform utilizes a secure proprietary digital currency to facilitate all transactions within the network. This currency is the exclusive medium of exchange for content sales, subscriptions, and other services on EQC One.\nHo explains that service providers, such as content distributors, earn this digital money through certified Proof of Work (PoW) contributions, which validate their efforts in delivering content and maintaining the platform’s infrastructure.\nEQCertificate is a security feature for EQC One. It certifies transactions and validates PoWs for server providers. This mechanism certifies integrity and trust in all interactions on the platform.\nThis establishes a secure and transparent environment where creators can confidently transact and share their content without fear of fraud or manipulation. Ho explains, “In every transaction, EQCertificate verifies the identity of senders and receivers within the EQC One network. Verifying confirms data integrity and protection from cyberattacks like eavesdropping, interception, and forging. It guarantees security for data flows over the network.”\nA Platform Designed with Creators in Mind EQC One is more than just a transactional platform; it’s a haven for creators seeking financial independence and security for their work. Charging only 0.5% on transactions allows content providers to retain 99.5% of their earnings, a stark contrast to traditional platforms that take significant cuts from creators’ revenues.\nThe platform also prohibits algorithms from filtering or unfairly promoting content, relying instead on transparent metrics like downloads, ratings, or recommendations from trusted critics. This method makes certain that merit determines visibility rather than opaque algorithms that often favor more prominent players.\nMoreover, EQC One enforces strict identity verification for all users to eliminate anonymity-driven issues like trolling or unauthorized content usage. This policy fosters accountability while removing the need for censorship, a principle central to Teklium’s vision of an open yet secure internet.\nEQC One also introduces its read-once function, which certifies content from photos, videos, music, or any artwork that can only be accessed once, regardless of the number of copies that may exist online or offline. Ho mentions that after a single read, all other copies of the data become invalid, rendering them unusable. This clever feature gives creators unparalleled control over their content, preventing unauthorized duplication and distribution while enabling creators to keep full control over who they authorize to access their work.\nHo emphasizes, “Creators pour their hearts into their craft. With EQC One, we’re giving them a space where their talent is respected and rewarded fairly.”\nStart of New Era in Content Creation Teklium recognizes the power of content creation and its ability to shape culture and society. EQC One eliminates the barriers that hinder safe and rewarding content creation, and replaces it with a platform where talent can shine without exploitation.\nHo and the whole EQC One team look forward to unlocking a new era of creativity and innovation. Ho believes that EQC One can open new opportunities for professionals across industries, allowing them to exchange ideas, services, inventions, and products that will benefit both content creators and audiences.",
