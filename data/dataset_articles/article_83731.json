  "text": "Ageless Innovation developed animatronic pets about 10 years ago.\n\"Purrs and meows, it lifts its paw, adorable,\" said Colleen McMichael, whose mom had one during her last few years of life.\n\"It brought her such joy,\" said McMichael.\nNow, after raising enough money, she is adopting out dozens of these life like felines to the residents here at the Loft at Linn memory care unit in East Providence in memory of her mom, Peggy Clavin, who spent her last six months there. Her robotic cat, 'kitty,' always near by.\n\"And she took this cat everywhere, she took it to the dining room, she took it when we went out. She just loved this cat,\" recalled McMichael.\n\"All of our products were designed with older adults, not just for them but with them,\" said Ted Fischer, CEO and co-founder of Ageless Innovation. They developed these interactive companions, paying close attention to the details. For instance, when a cat purrs.\n\"We have a technology called vibra purr that simulates that action,\" said Fischer.\n\"We're in about 25 countries and we've got about 700,000 of them that have been adopted around the world.\"\n\"I think this is amazing,\" said Kara Ruffel. She helped her dad, Don Curran, adopt his new companion. And he already has a name.\n\"George. He wants it to be a boy and named it George,\" said Ruffel.\nJanet, another resident, named her cat Pearl.\n\"She looks like a pearl,\" said Janet as she was grooming her new feline.\n\"It's just amazing to see how they bond,\" said Donna McGowan, executive director of the Alzheimer's Association of Rhode Island. She calls this the best kind of pet therapy.\n\"It brings back somebody, way back in their earlier lifetime where it brought them great comfort and it brings them great comfort now,\" said McGowan.",
