  "text": "WORLD\nAncient Pompeii tomb yields stunning sculptures of priestess\nAccording to a latest article, The Guardian features that archaeologists have uncovered remarkable sculptures of a man and a woman, believed to depict a prominent priestess, during excavations at a grand tomb in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii.\nThe nearly lifesize figures were found in a tomb featuring multiple burial niches along a large wall in the necropolis of Porta Sarno, one of the main gateways to the ancient city. Pompeii, famously buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79, continues to offer significant archaeological discoveries.\nExperts suggest that the woman in the sculpture may have been a notable local figure, possibly a priestess of Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture, fertility, and motherhood. This theory is supported by the intricate jewelry and accessories depicted in the sculpture, including earrings, rings, bracelets, and especially a crescent-shaped lunula pendant hanging from her necklace.\nThe female figure is shown wearing a veil and a large cloak over a tunic, while the male figure is draped in a toga. However, experts caution against assuming the two figures represent a married couple, as no inscriptions accompany the statues.\nGabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Pompeii archaeological park, explained, “Because she really looks like a very important woman in the local elite, there is also this idea that she could have been a priestess of Ceres, holding these plants and what appears to be a papyrus roll.”\nThe woman is depicted holding laurel leaves, a symbol traditionally used in Roman rituals to purify and bless spaces by dispersing incense and smoke from aromatic herbs.\nZuchtriegel also noted that funerary sculptures of this kind often do not represent couples. \"This could be her husband, but it could also be her son,\" he said, emphasizing that the lack of inscriptions leaves the relationship uncertain.\nThe sculptures are currently being restored and will be displayed in Pompeii starting April 16. The excavations at the Porta Sarno necropolis are a joint project with the European University of Valencia, continuing to reveal insights into the diverse society of Pompeii.\nBy Naila Huseynova",
