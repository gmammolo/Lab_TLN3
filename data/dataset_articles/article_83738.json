  "text": "Luxury Presence has introduced Private Listings Hub, an invitation-only platform designed to help real estate agents promote off-market and pre-market listings with greater control and discretion.\nThe platform allows agents to decide how and when to share listings , from limiting visibility to their brokerage to broadening exposure across the Luxury Presence network.\nThe tool matches listings against more than 300,000 active buyer needs, drawing from a network of high-performing agents who handle more than $300 billion in annual sales.\nIt also aligns with recent clarifications to the National Association of Realtors’ Clear Cooperation Policy , enabling the selective sharing of “office exclusives” and pre-market promotions under new delayed marketing status provisions.\n“For luxury agents whose clients demand privacy, Private Listings Hub provides a versatile way to market off-market and pre-market properties,” said Malte Kramer , CEO of Luxury Presence. “You can share within your brokerage only, automatically match with agents who have qualified buyers, handpick a shortlist of agents, or broadcast to everyone on our platform.”\nAgents can control listing visibility, filter buyer matches and receive notifications for relevant off-market opportunities. The platform builds on Luxury Presence’s earlier Brokerage Listing Network release, offering brokerages and agents compliant solutions for handling private listings.\n“I work with many high-profile clients who value privacy, so having the option to market privately on the Luxury Presence platform is a huge advantage,” said Jade Mills, a top-producing agent with more than $9 billion in career sales.\nThe platform will roll out to Luxury Presence customers over the next three weeks and will later become available to qualified agents outside the network.\nIn January, Concierge Auctions entered a co-marketing partnership with Luxury Presence, offering Luxury Presence clients the ability to promote upcoming auctions.",
