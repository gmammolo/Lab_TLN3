  "text": "Health care companies rose as traders rotated back into high-risk biotech firms.\nFederal drug regulators missed the deadline for making a key decision regarding a Covid-19 vaccine from Novavax, days after the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine chief was pushed out.\nNovavax ticked up, but remained deep in the red for the year to date. The Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit against three large pharmacy-benefit managers over insulin prices -- Cigna's Express Scripts, UnitedHealth Group's Optum Rx and CVS Health's CVS Caremark -- is on hold after President Trump fired two of the agency's commissioners.\nPlanned Parenthood is closing clinics and facing more financial strains as Republican control of Washington opens new avenues for weakening the abortion provider.\nWrite to Rob Curran at rob.curran@dowjones.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n04-02-25 1741ET\nShare © Dow Jones - 2025",
