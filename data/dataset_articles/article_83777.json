  "text": "Mr. Francis Letourneau reports\nNURAN ANNOUNCES 20 NEW SITES IN MARCH\nNuran Wireless Inc. established 20 new network sites in rural Africa in the month of March, 2025.\nNuran previously targeted 42 new sites for the month of March. Twenty-one towers currently in inventory in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remain in transit, delaying their deployment. Nuran is monitoring the situation daily and hopes to resolve the issue in the coming days.\nThe addition of these 20 new sites marks another important step toward reaching positive EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Nuran has deployed 40 new sites so far in 2025 with a target of 204 by the end of June. This short-term delay should not impact the targeted goal.\nCurrent live sites continue their growth trajectory, leading to increased revenue per site. This has resulted in Nuran having already reached its revenue forecast for this reporting period.\nNuran remains focused on executing its expansion plans and maintaining network growth as a top priority. The company will continue to scale its operations in key markets across Africa, further contributing to economic and social development by bringing connectivity to remote areas.\nAbout Nuran Wireless Inc.\nNuran Wireless is a leading rural telecommunications company that meets the growing demand for wireless network coverage in remote and rural regions around the globe. With its affordable and innovative scalable solutions of 2G, 3G and 4G technologies, Nuran Wireless offers a new possibility for more than one billion people to communicate effectively over long distances efficiently and affordably. \"Bridging the digital divide, one connection at a time.\"\nWe seek Safe Harbor.\n© 2025 Canjex Publishing Ltd.
