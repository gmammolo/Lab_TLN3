  "text": "Harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, researchers have developed a groundbreaking tool to revolutionize melanoma treatment. This article explores how this innovative AI predicts patient response to immunotherapy , offering a potential leap forward in personalized cancer care. Learn how this technology could dramatically improve treatment outcomes by tailoring therapies to individual patient needs.\nAI Tool Predicts Immunotherapy Response in Melanoma Patients, Offering Hope for Targeted Treatment Mexico City – A groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) tool, developed by researchers at the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), promises too revolutionize melanoma treatment by predicting patient response to immunotherapy. This innovative technology analyzes clinical data to determine whether a patient’s skin cancer will respond to immunotherapy, a treatment that harnesses the body’s immune cells to fight cancer.\nThe Science Behind the Prediction The research team, led by Dr. Laura Cecilia Bonifaz alfonzo, head of the IMSS Health Research Coordination, created an automatic learning model. This model quantifies immune system populations and analyzes their relationship with immunotherapy response. The goal is to differentiate between patients who will respond positively to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and those who will not.\nImmunotherapy Explained Immunotherapy works by helping the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Cancer cells sometiems evade the immune system using receptors and inhibitory molecules.Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy removes these “brakes,” allowing the immune system to effectively target and destroy cancer cells.\nDr. Bonifaz Alfonzo emphasized the potential impact of this tool:\nThe idea is that our project can support the choice of the doctor’s treatment, that is, that the doctor can do this test and with this decide whether it is adequate that this therapy occurs or find an choice strategy.\nDr. Laura Cecilia Bonifaz Alfonzo, Head of IMSS Health Research Coordination\nprecision Medicine: A Personalized Approach The IMSS reports that this AI tool will enable doctors to more accurately determine the most effective treatment for each cancer patient. This aligns with the principles of precision medicine, where treatments are tailored to the individual characteristics of each patient’s disease.\nSaraí Gisel de León Rodríguez, a science teacher and associated researcher in the Medical Research Unit in Immunology of the Pediatrics Hospital of the National Medical Center 21st, highlighted the broader applications of this research:\nThe objective of this research is to generate a test that helps the best choice of treatment and thus treat patients with melanoma and other types of tumors, such as:\nbreast cancer Lung cancer How the AI Works: Detecting and Analyzing Cells The AI is used to detect and classify cells within tissue samples, determining their type (e.g., A, B, or C) and whether they indicate a positive or negative prognosis. This involves analyzing various data points and employing different methodologies to extract cellular data.\nDe León Rodríguez elaborated on the process:\nIn this way we can obtain various images that represent what he is doing with the patient and thus be able to evaluate whether or not to respond to immunotherapy.\nSaraí gisel de León Rodríguez, Science Teacher and Associated Researcher\nThe team has developed a test to identify patients who will respond to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy in melanoma, a highly aggressive skin cancer with a five-year survival rate of less than 30% in advanced stages.\nthe Promise of Immunotherapy and the Need for Predictive Tools While immunotherapy has shown remarkable success, with studies reporting a median overall survival of approximately 72 months compared to the 10 months typically seen with chemotherapy, approximately 40% of patients do not respond to the treatment. This underscores the critical need for tools that can predict treatment response.\nDe León Rodríguez emphasized the importance of understanding the immune system’s interaction with melanoma:\nWe have raised the importance of characterizing the immune system, and also their contact with melanoma and distinguishing in this way which patient will respond or will not respond to immunotherapy. We do this through different methodologies.\nSaraí Gisel de león Rodríguez, Science Teacher and Associated Researcher\nthe IMSS research group has been working with patient biopsies, performing immunofluorescence to evaluate the cells present in the tissue.\nThese immunofluorescences help us evaluate which cells are present in the tissue and evaluate what these are, we use methodologies based on artificial intelligence.\nSaraí Gisel de León Rodríguez, Science Teacher and Associated Researcher\nLooking Ahead: Expanding the Application of AI in Cancer treatment The ultimate goal is to provide more precise treatment for patients, ensuring they recieve the therapy that is most likely to be effective. This approach is not limited to melanoma; the researchers aim to extend it to other tumors, such as breast and lung cancer, that are also susceptible to immunotherapy.\nde León Rodríguez envisions a future where AI-driven diagnostics play a crucial role in cancer care:\nnot only keep melanoma, which is this neoplasia originated in the skin, but to transfer it to other types of tumors such as breast cancer, lung, etc., which are susceptible to the use of this same therapy.\nPrevention is Key Early diagnosis is crucial for improving prognosis. The researchers emphasize the importance of regular skin checks and prompt evaluation of any suspicious moles.",
