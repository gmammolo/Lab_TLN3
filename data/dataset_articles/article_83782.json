  "text": "LISD student makes breakthrough in cancer research\nLAREDO, Tex. (KGNS) - A student from Laredo is achieving a medical breakthrough that could aid in the fight against cancer.\nTexas A&M International University student and Garcia Early College Senior Pablo Guzman is making his mark in biomedical research.\nAt just 17 years old, Guzman and his team are developing a potential treatment for a specific type of cancer, which has already been recognized by the American Chemical Society.\nAfter losing three family members to cancer, Guzman dedicated himself to learning more about the disease in hopes of one day helping others diagnosed with it.\nWith extensive research and lab work, Guzman and his team developed a treatment similar to a nicotine patch that may be effective in treating skin cancer.\n“I thought, ‘Well, something that we could do is have it deliver some sort of chemotherapy instead.’ Currently, chemotherapy has a big drawback in that it requires a big dosage, and that has a few problems. The tumor can build resistance to chemo, so you need higher dosages. My thought process was, ‘Let’s reduce the dosage needed,’ and we’ve been at the lab trying to solve that. We’ve had excellent results,“ Guzman said.\nGuzman is scheduled to graduate this year and plans to attend Texas A&M University in College Station. He intends to stay in touch with his research team and continue building on the work they have already started.\nHe is scheduled to hold a conference on April 11, during which he will present his findings to students and fellow researchers.\nIn a separate article, we learn more from Guzman about his research and his academic journey.\nFor more headlines, click here.\nCopyright 2025 KGNS.
