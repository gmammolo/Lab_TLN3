  "text": "If you are a fan of Stardew Valley but sometimes wished it had more horror elements, then you are in luck as this upcoming release is free to try out right now.\nCombining the farming sim elements of Stardew Valley with the horror themes found in Resident Evil, We Harvest Shadows is an upcoming first-person farming horror allegory from developer David Wehle.\nCheck out the trailer for Stardew Valley below!\nThis single-player title will see you become a recluse, build up your farm, and survive the lonely nights - and its demo is now available to try out for free courtesy of Steam.\nAdvert\nWe Harvest Shadows will see players take on the role of Garrett, a man who once lived in the city but has now found himself in charge of an abandoned farm.\nHe thinks the world just may be better off without him in it and so this emotional narrative adventure is so much more than your average farming simulator.\nEspecially as when the night draws close, Garrett no longer feels alone; is something really stalking him from the shadows?\nBy day, you will fix up your house, care for livestock, improve the land and explore the hundreds of acres that you now find yourself surrounded by.\nAdvert\n“Taking inspiration both from slow-burn P.T.-style psychological horror games and Edith Finch-style personal first-person titles, this game plays on poignant horror themes to gradually imagine a terrifying vision that Garrett must save himself from—until the soul-shaking end,” the official synopsis reads.\nWith slow-burn horror (no reliance on jump scares here), a gorgeous cinematic soundtrack, survival elements that don't just rely on hunger and thirst, and even a story that will see you needing to piece together Garrett’s past, this farming simulator is not one to miss out on.\nWe Harvest Shadows has not yet received a full release date but it is now available to download as a free demo over on Steam.\nTopics: Steam, Resident Evil, Stardew Valley, PC",
