Join us for smart, insightful posts and conversations about where the energy industry is and where it is going.\nShared Link\nNew Ways To Sequester Carbon Despite Retreat From Climate Change Action\n- Apr 2, 2025 7:12 pm GMT\nRapid decarbonization is the purpose of the burgeoning carbon capture industry. Companies are looking at how to remove mainly CO2 from the air and water. The companies want to make it profitable. Currently, the cost per captured ton of CO2 is prohibitive. To invent cheaper solutions, universities are coming to the rescue, where academics are looking to mimic natural processes and use commonly found materials that have high adsorbent CO2 properties.\nNew Ways To Sequester Carbon Despite Retreat From Climate Change Action\nCarbon capture is an offshoot of the energy industry and manufacturing. Rapid decarbonization has produced many potential business models but the cost per ton of captured CO2 remains prohibitive. Researchers at Stanford and Ben Gurion Universities, however, have each come up with low-cost CCS solutions that emulate and accelerate natural weathering processes.\nGet Published - Build a Following\nThe Energy Central Power Industry Network® is based on one core idea - power industry professionals helping each other and advancing the industry by sharing and learning from each other.\nIf you have an experience or insight to share or have learned something from a conference or seminar, your peers and colleagues on Energy Central want to hear about it. It's also easy to share a link to an article you've liked or an industry resource that you think would be helpful.",
