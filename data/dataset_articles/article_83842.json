  "text": "YouTube is the most-widely used video streaming service in the world with a net worth of $550 billion currently, making it the king of all media. The video streaming service, due to its variety of content, is also poised to become the leader of all video content media in revenue generation and screen timing in 2025 as per the statistics.\nAccording to the analyst Michael Nathanson at MoffettNathanson , YouTube was the second-largest company by revenue in 2024 with a generated revenue of $54.2 billion, just behind Disney, which the company is in a position to replace as the top most company in 2025. Moreover, in the past 12 months, for the second time in February 2025, YouTube became the largest aggregate TV content source in the US as per the screening time. Which means that it surpassed even the giants, like Disney, Fox Corp, Paramount Global, Netflix etc.\nAccording to Nathanson's analysis, if YouTube remains on the same trajectory, it will grow even further in 2025, allowing it to even become the premier streaming aggregator. The numbers surely do indicate this end result. YouTube generated $36.15 billion in ad revenue in 2024 alone, and its subscription revenue in the 12-month period until September 2024 topped at $15 billion. YouTube TV service has become the biggest online TV service in the USA with more than 8 million subscribers; plus, its YouTube music and premium services have crossed 125 million subscribers. He says that YouTube will have 10% of the share of the $85 billion TV industry by the end of 2026 and will surely become the leader in the industry.\nNathanson also predicts that YouTube operating income, which was $7.8 billion in 2024, will likely grow to $10.2 billion this year and will grow further to $13.8 billion in 2027, with operating margin increasing from 14% to 16% and then 18% respectively. This he says will be due to more subscriptions and better subscription rates.\nAnother factor that will increase YouTube subscribers and help it in increasing its revenue is better smart devices and faster internet. In the upcoming years, better versions of the existing smartphones will enter the market which will be faster and will expand the scope of online streaming services. Also, new ways to give access to faster internet are replacing the existing ones, like the Starlink project by Elon Musk. Such technologies will give access to the internet to areas where the internet is still unknown. Both will force people to prefer online services like Youtube to traditional TV due to its convenience and variety it offers, thus increasing its subscribers.\nImage: DIW-Aigen\nRead next: OpenAI Anticipates Delays in New Image Generation Tool for ChatGPT Due to Capacity Challenges",
