  "text": "Get hype!\nThe Duskbloods was announced last night during the Nintendo Direct, a FromSoftware Switch 2 exclusive title that’s expected in 2026.\nBeyond the trailer — which also confirms the game is multiplayer — not much else about the title was shared, though Nintendo and FromSoftware will detail more about the game from 6 April here in Australia.\nFor now, check out the trailer below.\nPretty neat, eh? What do you make of The Duskbloods at this stage?\nWe’ll have more on The Duskbloods as news becomes available.\nThis article may contain affiliate links, meaning we could earn a small commission if you click-through and make a purchase.
