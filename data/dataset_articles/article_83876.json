  "text": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has applauded the wave of artificial intelligence adoption in India, calling it “amazing to watch.” In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Altman expressed admiration for the country’s pace of innovation, saying, “We love to see the explosion of creativity—India is outpacing the world.” His remarks have since gone viral, reflecting the growing influence of Indian developers, startups, and creators in the global AI space.\nThe acknowledgment comes at a time when India has been witnessing a surge in AI-based products, platforms, and applications—from government initiatives to grassroots tech startups building world-class tools powered by artificial intelligence.\nwhat's happening with ai adoption in india right now is amazing to watch.\nwe love to see the explosion of creativity–india is outpacing the world.\n— Sam Altman (@sama) April 2, 2025\nMeanwhile, the Ghibli-style AI art trend is taking over the internet\nAs Altman’s tweet gained traction, another development stirred the AI community—Studio Ghibli-style AI art, generated using OpenAI’s latest 4o Image Generation tool, is dominating online trends. The tool, available within ChatGPT, allows users to produce animation-style imagery reminiscent of Ghibli films, and the feature’s popularity has resulted in overwhelming server demand.\nOpenAI CEO responds to ChatGPT’s heavy usage surge\nReacting to the sudden spike in ChatGPT usage, Altman posted another update cautioning users about performance issues. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he noted.\nHe even humorously added, “Working as fast we can to really get stuff humming; if anyone has GPU capacity in 100k chunks we can get asap please call!”\nChatGPT crosses 150 million users milestone\nChatGPT has now surpassed 150 million users, and features like Ghibli-style image generation are playing a big role in attracting a new wave of creative users globally. However, this viral usage has also forced OpenAI to implement usage limits on its tools to ensure performance stability.\nAltman’s recent remarks, both in admiration of India’s AI boom and in response to global usage challenges, show how rapidly the AI landscape is evolving—and how India is becoming a central figure in that growth.",
