  "text": "Altcoin\nEOS crypto rallies 20% – What’s behind the surge and can it last?\n- EOS rallied over 20%, driven by rebranding to Vaulta, high staking yields, and bullish derivatives\n- Social Dominance spiked but then cooled off; EOS price still holds steady with strong buying pressure\n[EOS [EOS]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions) is making waves in the market, rallying over 20% and leaving traders buzzing about its transformation into Vaulta.\nWith staking yields poised to outshine\n[Ethereum[ETH]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions) and [Solana[SOL]](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions) and derivatives traders betting big on more upside, EOS is shedding its stagnant past and stepping into the spotlight. But is the hype sustainable, or will profit-taking put a lid on the gains?\nCatalysts behind EOS’s surge\nThe recent EOS crypto rally can be traced to three key factors. First, the buzz around EOS’s impending rebranding to Vaulta is drawing investor attention.\nSet to launch by the end of May 2025, Vaulta aims to transform EOS into a blockchain-powered banking hub, complete with a new ticker and continued integration with exSat, the Bitcoin banking solutions.\nSecondly, the introduction of a staking yield of around 17% for the new Vaulta token is significantly higher than Ethereum’s 2.03% and Solana’s 5.14%, supported by a reward pool of roughly 250 million tokens.\nLastly, derivatives traders are showing growing confidence in EOS. According to data from CoinGlass, Open Interest (OI) in EOS futures has seen a sharp rise, reaching a recent high of approximately $170 million.\nThis represents a significant jump from the $90 million level recorded just a few weeks ago, signaling strong bullish sentiment.\nAdditionally, the data highlights EOS’s price rallying alongside the increase in OI, suggesting that traders are positioning themselves for further gains, driven by the ongoing rebranding excitement and attractive staking incentives.\nThe crowd is taking notice\nEOS’s Social Dominance has also seen a notable rise following the surge in derivatives activity. Santiment data reveals that the metric jumped to nearly 2.8% as EOS’s price climbed above $0.80, reaching its highest level in months.\nThis increase in social activity highlights the growing alignment between retail and institutional interest, driven by anticipation of the upcoming Vaulta rebranding.\nHowever, Social Dominance has since cooled off to around 0.35%, suggesting that while the initial buzz was intense, it may be tapering off.\nStill, the price remains resilient, hinting that the rally’s momentum could persist if social sentiment picks up again.",
