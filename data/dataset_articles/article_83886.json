  "text": "M.A.D. Skincare’s professional, non-invasive CARBONETIX Skin Rejuvenation System mitigates oxidative stress that can damage skin, causing premature aging and contributing to skin cancer. Instead, M.A.D. Skincare’s new system creates a skin environment that’s friendly to active ingredients and helps maximize micronutrient absorption for a more radiant tone and texture.\nWhat can CARBONETIX do?\nStrap in–M.A.D.’s new skin care system improves cellular respiration, detoxes, hydrates, brightens and reduces the appearance of wrinkles (oh my!) for longevity you’ll see and feel. CARBONETIX brings benefits that are more than just skin-deep, boosting circulation and activating regenerative processes at the cellular level for a healthier barrier, which means healthier, more resilient skin for clients. As if that wasn’t enough, M.A.D. Skin care’s new system improves antioxidant defenses to support cellular health for additional well-aging support.\nHow does CARBONETIX work?\nThe key is the magnesium and citric acid combo hidden in the activator powder, which triggers the release of free hydrogen. This chemical reaction grants access to active compounds that purify for more hydrated skin, which can be especially beneficial for clients with skin conditions that are prone to irritation, like eczema or rosacea. The gel’s active ingredients then trigger the one-two chain reactions that infuse skin with elastin and collagen to diminish the appearance of wrinkles, ß-White to target hyperpigmentation and Niacinamide for a renewed glow.\nWith its unique dual-chemical reactions to neutralize free radicals, CARBONETIX is a great way to nurture the longevity of clients’ skin. Estheticians can build skin up starting at the cellular level with M.A.D. Skincare’s CARBONETIX Skin Rejuvenating System.",
