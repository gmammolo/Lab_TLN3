  "text": "Breadcrumb\n-\nHome -\nResource Library - Tackling Black Carbon: How To Unlock Fast Climate and Clean Air Benefits\nReducing black carbon alongside other super pollutants is the fastest, most effective way to achieve near-immediate climate gains while improving air quality, public health, and the economy. The case for action is clear – proven solutions exist to cut emissions rapidly and at scale, but greater attention and urgency are essential.\nFocusing on the sources of black carbon, characterised by dirty fuels and inefficient burning, offers an opportunity to deliver substantial climate, health, and social justice benefits at pace. By prioritising the most affected regions and communities, ranging from the billions of people relying on polluting fuels in their homes to Arctic Indigenous Populations and those living in wildfire-prone areas, we can make significant strides in both mitigating climate change and improving quality of life. Alongside deep decarbonisation, a targeted focus on black carbon draws together action on climate change and clean air, allowing efforts in one area to amplify progress in the other.",
