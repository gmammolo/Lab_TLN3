  "text": "A new, Melbourne-made exhibition will explore the history of videogames and support the next generation of game developers - thanks to the Allan Labor Government.\nMinister for Creative Industries Colin Brooks today announced Game Worlds, a new exhibition that will premiere at ACMI - Australia's national museum of screen culture - in September.\nFrom the pioneering games of the 1970s through to today's hit titles, the exhibition will include original concept art, rare objects, playable demos and never before seen designs from games like World of Warcraft, The Sims, and Neopets.\nAligned with the exhibition, ACMI will also invite Australian creators to submit their ideas for commissions of up to $10,000 to create browser-based 'microgames', which will be exhibited at ACMI and visitors will be able to play for the duration of Game Worlds. Applications for the commissions open today and close 5 May.\nIt is the third major videogames exhibition staged by ACMI after 2008's Game On and 2012's Game Masters, which toured the world and was seen by 1.1 million people. It comes hot on the heels of 2024's Honk! Untitled Goose Exhibition, which celebrated the Melbourne-made global smash.\nVictoria is the epicentre of game development in Australia, home to 44 per cent of the country's games studios and 57 per cent of its games workforce, as well as the Asia Pacific's largest games industry event - Melbourne International Games Week. Local studios are creating games that are played by millions around the world.\nGame Worlds will run from 18 September 2025 to 8 February 2026, alongside a program of film screenings, talks, community nights, accessibility programs, family activities and exclusive industry and fan events.\nTickets go on pre-sale 3 July and on sale to the general public on 17 July at acmi.net.au. To apply or find out more about the microgame commission visit https://www.acmi.net.au/collection-preservation/commissions/micro game.\nAs stated by Minister for Creative Industries Colin Brooks\n\"Videogame fans of all ages are going to love Game Worlds, which continues ACMI's track record of showcasing digital games and supporting our homegrown games industry.\"\n\"Digital games are big business for our state and the Allan Labor Government is proud to back this exhibition and support our next generation of game developers including through the microgames commissions program.\"\nAs stated by ACMI Director and CEO Seb Chan\n\"Game Worlds celebrates the evolution of this century's defining artform. It builds on ACMI's long-term support of the Australian videogame sector through preservation, education, industry partnerships, our dedicated Games Lab, and our experience in making videogame exhibitions.\"\nhere.",
