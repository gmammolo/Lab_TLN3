  "text": "A new version of the MLPerf tests simulates how fast a chatbot might respond to prompts. MLCommons\nNvidia's general-purpose GPU chips have once again made a nearly clean sweep of one of the most popular benchmarks for measuring chip performance in artificial intelligence, this time with a new focus on generative AI applications such as large language models (LLMs).\nThere wasn't much competition.\nSystems put together by SuperMicro, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, and others -- packed with as many as eight Nvidia chips -- on Wednesday took most of the top honors in the MLPerf benchmark test organized by the MLCommons, an industry consortium.\nAlso: With AI models clobbering every benchmark, it's time for human evaluation\nThe test, measuring how fast machines can produce tokens, process queries, or output samples of data -- known as AI inference -- is the fifth installment of the prediction-making benchmark that has been going on for years.\nThis time, the MLCommons updated the speed tests with two tests representing common generative AI uses. One test is how fast the chips perform on Meta's open-source LLM Llama 3.1 405b, which is one of the larger gen AI programs in common use.\nThe MLCommons also added an interactive version of Meta's smaller Llama 2 70b. That test is meant to simulate what happens with a chatbot, where response time is a factor. The machines are tested for how fast they generate the first token of output from the language model, to simulate the need for a quick response when someone has typed a prompt.\nA third new test measures the speed of processing graph neural networks, which are problems composed of a bunch of entities and…\nTiernan Ray",
