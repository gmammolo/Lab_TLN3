  "text": "Crypto markets are back in motion, helped along by increased interest from institutions and fresh liquidity from everyday traders. As the environment turns more optimistic, some altcoins are starting to break away from the noise—driven by real use cases and steady development.\nRight now, BlockDAG, XRP, Binance Coin, and Toncoin are building their own momentum. Some are gaining from early-stage traction, others from long-standing influence. But together, they’re all part of the conversation around the best crypto to buy now.\nBlockDAG has put itself on the map with a different approach. It uses a hybrid model, mixing Proof-of-Work and DAG technology to let multiple miners handle transactions at once. That setup helps speed things up and keeps network fees low.\nWhat caught the community’s attention recently was its Keynote 3 on March 28. This update wasn’t just a standard project briefing—it gave a clear view of what’s been done, what’s coming, and how the entire setup works. Features like the BlockDAG Academy were also introduced, providing even more clarity to users and developers.\nSince the presale kicked off, BlockDAG has raised more than $210 million and sold over 19 billion coins. Its token price moved from $0.001 to $0.0248, marking a massive 2,380% jump from its starting point. That alone is enough to make people pay attention.\nBig steps are still ahead, including the Token Generation Event, a mainnet rollout, and listings on major exchanges. With those milestones on the horizon, BlockDAG’s current position makes it one of the best crypto options to watch right now—especially for those looking for projects with proven demand and a strong technical foundation.\nXRP isn’t just a name from past bull runs. Its core use—speeding up cross-border payments—still gives it value. Developed by Ripple Labs, it lets users convert between currencies at a lower cost and faster pace than most traditional platforms.\nRight now, XRP is hovering around $2.26. Some market watchers think it could reach $3, while others are pointing toward a dip to $1.07 if pressure builds. Its use in the payments world helps keep it relevant, even when markets cool off. For anyone trying to weigh up the best crypto to buy now, XRP still brings solid use and familiarity.\nBNB began as a way to cut fees on Binance’s exchange but has since grown into something far bigger. People now use it for everything from travel bookings to retail payments, and it’s become a key part of Binance’s overall platform.\nBNB is currently trading at roughly $630.79. Some forecasts suggest it could go over $1,000 within a year. The demand stays steady, partly because BNB plays a central role in Binance’s regular operations. If you’re comparing long-term hold options, this one still earns a spot in conversations about the best crypto to buy now.\nToncoin’s roots go back to Telegram, and its goal is to make digital transactions quicker and more convenient. It powers The Open Network and helps users send and receive funds without friction.\nTrading at around $3.96, Toncoin has recently seen a boost in trading volume, passing $384 million over a 24-hour span. A $400 million fundraising round also added fuel to the fire. Some believe Toncoin could rise another 60% as adoption grows. For those scanning the market for new ideas, TON brings a mix of big backing and fresh energy.\nEach of these altcoins has its own angle. XRP continues to serve cross-border transactions. Binance Coin powers a giant exchange and its services. Toncoin benefits from being connected to one of the world’s largest messaging apps.\nBut BlockDAG brings something that stands out—a proven 2,380% gain, over $210 million in presale raised, and new features backed by a clearly explained roadmap. With its Keynote 3 release laying out the path ahead and a rising number of users already involved, BDAG may be the best crypto to buy now based on current potential and growth alone.\nJoin our WhatsApp Channel to get the latest news, exclusives and videos on WhatsApp\n________",
