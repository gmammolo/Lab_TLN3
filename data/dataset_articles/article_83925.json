  "text": "BlockDAG Rewards Previous Buyers with 150% Bonus, While XRP and SOL Gear Up for Growth After facing dips, both XRP and Solana (SOL) are now showing signs of recovery. Solana (SOL) posted a 14% gain over the past week, moving past important price points that could signal more gains. XRP also shows promise. The latest XRP price prediction indicates that after a period of price swings, the coin may be set for an upward move, with resistance ahead at $2.50.\nMeanwhile, presale favorite BlockDAG (BDAG) is turning heads with a special offer. It’s giving every past buyer a 150% retroactive bonus . Anyone who purchased BDAG without receiving a bonus will now get 150% extra. This unexpected boost has thrilled buyers and drawn in new supporters, pushing total presale funds past $210 million.\nXRP Price Prediction: Could It Reach $3 or Fall Below $2? XRP has shown major price movement in recent weeks. Over the last month and a half, it has fluctuated between $2.03 and $2.76. After peaking at $2.76 in mid-February, it slid down to $2.03 in early March, then began recovering again. As of March 24, 2025, XRP is priced at $2.43.\nKey levels to watch in the XRP price prediction are $2.03 for support and $2.50 for resistance. If the price can push above $2.50, analysts believe it could aim for $2.76 again or even rise to $3.00. But if it dips below $2.30, there’s a chance it could head back to $2.10 or $2.00, which would be a warning sign of more downside.\nSolana (SOL) Price Surge: 14% Weekly Jump Breaks Resistance Solana has had a strong week. Its price climbed 14%, hitting $142.53. Trading volumes also jumped by nearly 95%, reaching over $2.67 billion. Open interest in SOL futures increased by 8.6%, hitting $5 billion. This strong Solana (SOL) price surge pushed the coin past the $137 resistance level, a key barrier many were watching.\nCrypto analyst Crypto Curb mentioned that this move could mark the start of a new uptrend, especially since it ends a long period of falling prices. If this trend continues, SOL could be heading for a new target of $420. Still, it may take some time before we know if this rally has real staying power.\nBlockDAG Brings a 150% Bonus for All Previous Purchases, AMA Update Confirms BlockDAG recently held an AMA session that gave the community a chance to ask questions and get updates on the project’s future. The most exciting news? A new reward system offering a 150% bonus on all past BDAG purchases. The bonus applies to those who didn’t receive any earlier rewards or got less than 150%.\nFor example, if someone previously received only 50% or 100%, their bonus will be adjusted to a total of 150%. However, anyone who has already received more than 150% won’t be included in this round. The team also plans to fix any past errors related to bonus distributions.\nThis bonus plan has created a positive buzz across the community. It shows that BlockDAG values those who supported the project early on. Now, anyone who missed earlier offers can still claim 150% more BDAG —at no additional cost.\nBlockDAG’s community-first approach is clearly working. Its presale has now raised over $210 million and is heading toward a $600 million target. With BDAG priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, market experts suggest it could hit $1 in 2025. That’s a possible 3932% return for those getting in now, making BDAG a serious player among the top decentralized crypto projects.\nWhat’s the Top Decentralized Crypto to Watch in 2025? XRP has potential, but its future remains tied to whether it can break past $2.50 or hold above $2.30. The XRP price prediction hints at either a move to $3 or a drop below $2.00 if support fails. Solana, on the other hand, has already shown signs of strength with its 14% weekly rise. The Solana (SOL) price surge also broke major resistance, and analysts see a chance for further growth.\nStill, when it comes to high returns, BlockDAG leads the pack. Touted as the next $1 token of 2025, BDAG offers early buyers a rare opportunity. With the 150% bonus now extended to past buyers, the chance to earn even more is now on the table. This offer not only boosts profits but also confirms BlockDAG’s focus on fairness and long-term value, placing it among the top decentralized crypto projects to watch right now.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nDisclaimer: The text above is an advertorial article that is not part of Coincu.com editorial content.
