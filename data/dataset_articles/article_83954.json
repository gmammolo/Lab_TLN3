For better or worse, everyone will be starting The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered simultaneously on PC.\nWithout diving into spoilers,The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered's story is one of its best-selling points, so if you haven't played the first game, it's probably better to start with that before diving into this one.\nRelated\n Sony Backs Down On PSN Requirement For The Last Of Us 2, Spider-Man 2 And More\nIs this it, or are more games getting the same treatment?\nAside from dropping the PlayStation Network requirement in order to play the game on PC, Sony is also adding a few extras to the PC launch of TLOU2 Remastered on PC. Thankfully, console owners won't be left out, as they're also getting a game update tomorrow to add in new trophies and more.\nIf you're wondering if the game is worth the purchase price, read our review where we state, \"In a lot of ways, The Last of Us Part II will make you angry, it will upset you, and it will break your heart as much as its glimpses of warmth and humanity will lift your spirits.\" The game is also Steam Deck verified, so if you plan on playing it on your portable device, it should work without a hitch.\nAside from the game's launch and a new patch for console owners, Season 2 of HBO's The Last of Us TV show is premiering this month. While we don't know how many seasons the show will run, the showrunners assure people that they won't go the Game of Thrones route, which is comforting to hear.\nRelated\n Neil Druckmann Reveals Zombie Horror Icon \"Hated\" The Last Of Us When He First Pitched It In School\nIn a recent discussion, Neil Druckmann, the creator of The Last Of Us, described the project's rocky start and its success at Naughty Dog.",
