  "text": "AUSTIN (KXAN)— Artificial Intelligence is a part of our everyday lives, and it’s not going anywhere. In fact, we’re seeing more of it.\nIt’s why Huston-Tillotson University is hosting an HBCU AI conference and training summit this week.\nThere’s the hope to bridge the gap between technology and diverse representation. A young leader among the crowd doing just that, is Harmony School of Endeavor Senior Maurice Fox. He was was invited to speak about a social justice AI chat bot he helped create.\n“It’s pretty much designed to help culturally diverse individuals, like, kind of understand their rights,” Fox said. “Let’s say you got pulled over by the police…just whatever like you need help with, that’s what it’s there for.”\nIt’s things like this that those leading the conference hope will help diversify the AI space.\nEducators, students and industry leaders alike are discussing various topics at the conference, including exploring strategic ways to make AI more inclusive as it continuously changes.\n“When I’m in these tech spaces, far too often I don’t see people that look like me,” Meme Styles, co-chair of the conference and book author, said. “That has a lot to do with the inaccessibility of technology and the inaccessibility of kind of getting into the spaces of AI.”\nStyles said they designed the conference and invited various community partners to help attendees get a better grasp on AI, to help them keep up with it. “People are being pushed out of jobs…it’s about building the relationship that they need with AI in order to be sustained,” Styles said. Styles presented her new book , which she used AI to create the cover’s artwork. It’s interactive visuals and hands-on experiences like this, Styles said will go a long way.\nFox will be doing a live show and tell on his AI chat bot on Thursday.\n“I’m a little nervous,” he said with a slight laugh.\nHe’s one of the youngest speakers at the conference, and is already making an impact in the revolutionary space. For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to KXAN Austin.",
