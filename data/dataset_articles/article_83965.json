  "text": "Northeastern and Anthropic to lead in responsible AI innovation in higher education\nThe partnership will help transform teaching, research and business operations across Northeastern’s global enterprise — and serve as a model for AI in higher education.\nOn Wednesday, Anthropic, a global leader in artificial intelligence, announced a strategic partnership with Northeastern to co-design and develop a roadmap for the future of higher education.\nAnthropic said they are working with Northeastern to design and build best practices for AI integration in higher education, including new AI-powered tools, and frameworks for responsible AI adoption.\n“We believe AI will have a profound impact on all facets of education, and as a leading frontier AI lab, we are committed to delivering responsible AI access to students, faculty and administrators,” said Daniela Amodei, president and co-founder of Anthropic. “By working collaboratively with Northeastern, we aim to enhance the learning experience and contribute to the development of AI-powered educational tools that are safe, transparent and impactful.”\nThe partnership aligns with Northeastern’s commitment to embrace AI throughout its academic enterprise and to prepare students for multiple careers in the age of artificial intelligence.\nThe partnership will pilot co-designed and co-developed innovations using Anthropic’s leading AI technology to transform teaching, research and business operations across Northeastern’s global enterprise — and serve as a model for AI in higher education.\n“We are incredibly excited to partner with Anthropic in our goal to transform teaching, learning, research and operations through AI innovation to be the world’s leading AI-enabled university,” said Javed Aslam, Northeastern chief of artificial intelligence.\n“AI is a tool that will empower our students, faculty and staff, and together with Anthropic we will develop and provide the tools, resources and training that they need to effectively integrate AI into their work. We are also committed to the responsible use of AI and proud to work alongside a partner that shares this fundamental commitment.”\nThe university is also rolling out\nAnthropic’s Claude for Education, the latest platform to provide secure, reliable AI access across the enterprise. Students, faculty and staff will use Claude to refine bold ideas, analyze complex data sets, summarize information and produce innovative — and ethically responsible — solutions.\nFor faculty members like John Wihbey, an associate professor of media innovation and technology at Northeastern, this partnership is a game-changer. Wihbey is already incorporating generative AI tools like Claude — Anthropic’s most capable AI platform — into his curriculum and sees immense potential for AI to enhance learning.\n“Anthropic has developed AI products that are at the top of the field, particularly in areas like writing and coding,” Wihbey said. “The company is also known for its strong commitment to both innovation and safety. This formal partnership will provide our students and faculty with greater access to new tools, training, and functionality, allowing us to develop best practices for teaching and learning with AI.”\nEditor’s Picks\nHow teens make decisions: Juliet Davidow’s research sheds light on motivation and the adolescent mind\nHow teens make decisions: Juliet Davidow’s research sheds light on motivation and the adolescent mind\nElon Musk’s embrace of Donald Trump is damaging Tesla, new research shows\nElon Musk’s embrace of Donald Trump is damaging Tesla, new research shows\nFar-right party could use Marine Le Pen election ban as part of battle plan for power in France, says Northeastern expert\nFar-right party could use Marine Le Pen election ban as part of battle plan for power in France, says Northeastern expert\nNortheastern’s Retro Mobile Gaming Database is a landmark effort in games preservation\nNortheastern’s Retro Mobile Gaming Database is a landmark effort in games preservation\nThis Northeastern biotech CEO and graduate researcher is developing therapeutics to help improve people’s gut health\nThis Northeastern biotech CEO and graduate researcher is developing therapeutics to help improve people’s gut health\nAs part of the collaboration, all students, faculty and staff across Northeastern’s 13 global campuses will get free access to a premier version of Claude.\nNortheastern Ph.D. student and doctoral fellow Caleb Okereke is already experiencing the benefits of using Claude in his research.\nClaude is known for its excellence in code generation, visual reasoning and processing speed. The premium version of Claude also has more capabilities than free versions of many other large language models in tasks such as text generation, research support and summarization.\n“Being able to integrate Claude into my research is incredible,” Okereke said. “It has completely changed how I approach my work, helping me refine and crystallize some of my most foundational ideas. AI is evolving fast, and having access to a tool like this is essential for keeping up with that change and making the most of what’s possible.”\nOkereke believes that Northeastern’s leadership in AI education extends beyond simply adapting to AI — it is about shaping its future.\n“There’s a chance for us as students, using a product like Claude, to contribute beyond just adapting AI — we can play a role in defining and shaping its possibilities,” he said.\nThe university was also the first in the U.S. to develop an entire academic plan — Northeastern 2025 — focused on AI and its implications for the future of learning.\nNortheastern President Joseph E. Aoun, a thought leader in AI and higher education, authored “\nRobot-Proof,” the definitive book on the future of learning in an AI-driven world. A second edition, released by MIT Press in August 2024, further explores AI’s evolving role in education and the workforce.",
