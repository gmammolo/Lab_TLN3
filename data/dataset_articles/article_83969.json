  "text": "- Stay COTI is the beginning of a movement that will paves the way for the next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, and creatives.\n- It will provide a playground for innovation in which anybody may build on blockchain and thrive.\nFollowing the successful launch of the mainnet, COTI is now entering an exciting new phase, which is focused on expanding the ecosystem and generating significant activity throughout the network.\nStay COTI is a new community hub that is being released as part of this next step. It provides everyone, including those who do not have any prior knowledge with coding, with the help they need in order to create on COTI by utilizing straightforward AI prompts.\nIt is with the assistance of artificial intelligence that we are transforming the Web3 builder experience from one of complicated coding to one of straightforward creation with the introduction of Stay COTI. As a result of artificial intelligence, a new toolkit of natural language prompts that do not need coding has emerged, which welcomes a new generation of builders: individuals who have huge ideas but no technical expertise. Stay COTI is, at its heart, a platform that provides these builders with assistance as they bring their ideas to life. This assistance may come in the form of artificial intelligence tools, hands-on coaching, financing, marketing, community build sessions, and other activities.\nStay COTI is the beginning of a movement that will paves the way for the next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, and creatives. It will provide a playground for innovation in which anybody may build on blockchain and thrive.\nStay COTI: Built by You, for You\nStay COTI participants will have the opportunity to apply for financial and marketing assistance to assist them in bringing their ideas to fruition, thanks to the $50 million ABC Fund that is backed by COTI. Stay COTI is able to assist you with getting your own decentralized application (dApp) on COTI, a private non-fungible token (NFT) with confidential character qualities, an artificial intelligence agent for predictive analytics, a live event, or something else totally off the ground.\nKey components of Stay COTI include:\n- No-code Tools: Through hands-on supervision and mentoring, you will get the opportunity to experiment with the most recent no-code tooling and processes in order to bring your ideas to life.\n- Vibe Coding events: These hybrid gatherings, which will be conducted in cities and conferences all over the world, will bring together builders, creators, and ambassadors to brainstorm and create new initiatives. The first event will take place this week in Bangkok, and it will be followed by more hybrid gatherings that will take place online and in person.\n- Demos: As a source of motivation for eager builders who are interested in using COTI’s ground-breaking privacy features in real-world experiences, demonstrations will display real-world instances of decentralized applications (dApps) and integrations.\n- Live Build Sessions: These sessions, which are broadcast on a weekly basis, provide a hangout that is engaging, entertaining, and experimental. They are conducted by experienced builders who are both within and outside of the COTI ecosystem.\n- Grants and funding: The experimental spirit of early Web3 is being channeled by COTI, which is bringing back the ‘WAGMI’. Obtaining funding enables the COTI ecosystem to provide opportunities for experimentation, building, the organization of events, and the development of ideas and initiatives in conjunction with partner blockchains.\n- Problem-Solving Build Circles: There will be focused, blocker-based sessions that will link participants who are not technically savvy with technical mentors in order to solve typical issues that are experienced while working with AI technologies in a collaborative manner.\n- Plugins for Privacy-on-Demand: By using plugins for Privacy-on-Demand, COTI is able to be used across more than seventy blockchains, hence assisting builders in bringing privacy to projects that are part of the larger ecosystem.\nAs builders experiment with quick engineering and COTI’s privacy capabilities, Stay COTI is intended to release a wave of new use cases that may be taken advantage of later on. It is planned that the website\nstay.coti.io will serve as a central center for coordination, replete with an ideas board that will allow users to vote for the most compelling ideas and participate in the most recent Vibe Coding sessions and events.\nAny Chain, Any Community\nInteroperability and collaboration are two concepts that are deeply ingrained in the Stay COTI mindset. Developers working on popular chains, such as Solana, Cardano, Base, Arbitrum, and both EVM and non-EVM chains, will now able to exploit COTI’s privacy layer for use cases ranging from decentralized identity to decentralized finance to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and more. This will be accomplished using the Privacy-on-Demand framework.\nStay COTI will bring back a spirit of collaboration that Web3 has, in some parts, lost. This will be accomplished by providing creators, developers, and communities across numerous blockchain ecosystems with the ability to collaborate.\nLaunching with Vibe Coding in Bangkok\nThis will be the first big activation of Stay COTI, and it will take place in Bangkok on April 2 and 3. Members of the COTI community are getting together for a\nVibe Coding session and community hangout. This event will include two days of building in order to investigate what is possible when artificial intelligence and human creativity come together. The event is open to both novices and seasoned professionals, and it places an emphasis on quick ideation and experimentation. Artificial intelligence will take on a significant portion of the technical load, making it accessible to anybody who has a vision or concept.\nParticipants will be able to enter a prize draw, which will include incentives such as grant funds, participation in COTI events, and marketing help.\nThere will also be notable ecosystem sponsors present, including\nBancor, Band Protocol, Codex, Crafter, UCTalent Labs, and ChainsAtlas. These organizations will provide possibilities for cooperation, as well as mentoring and resources.\nBuilding for a Human-First Future\nThe doors to the future of Web3 are wide open as a result of the emergence of artificial intelligence.\nThis is your opportunity to create, develop, and thrive in a network that was designed for everyone, regardless of whether you are a builder, a visionary, or simply someone who enjoys experimenting with the many technologies that are now available.",
