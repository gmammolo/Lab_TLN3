  "text": "Wednesday was the official reveal of the Switch 2. Nintendo revealed that its next console will come out on June 5 and have a starting price of $450. In its hour-long Nintendo Direct, a lot of games were shown and I can safely say I'm excited.\nThe Switch 2 looks like it's going to have a lot of support from third-party developers to go along with Nintendo's spectacular first-party games. This means the new Switch will hit the ground running as its launch lineup already looks good, but there's going to be even more must-buy games after its launch.\nThese are a few of the games I'm most excited about:\nThe Duskbloods\nArguably, the biggest surprise of Wednesday's show was The Duskbloods from popular developer FromSoftware. The studio behind Dark Souls and Elden Ring is making an exclusive game for the Switch 2, and it looks remarkably like its last exclusive game, Bloodborne. There are still many questions about the game, but this is easily going to be the most anticipated game for 2026.\nHollow Knight: Silksong\nHollow Knight from developer Team Cherry was a cult hit when it came out in 2017. Back in 2019, the developer revealed it was doing a sequel called Hollow Knight: Silksong that would focus on Hornet, a rival turned ally of the Knight who was the hero of the first game. Only a few seconds were shown during the stream, but this clip excited fans as it was confirmation that the game exists after years of silence from the developer.\nMario Kart World\nIf there's one franchise that is a must-buy, it would be Mario Kart. With the new game, Mario Kart World, the kart racing game goes to an open-world game, letting players travel anywhere. The game looks like so much fun, and I'm looking to buy the Switch 2 Mario Kart World Bundle when the console launches.\nDonkey Kong Bananza\nOne of the franchises I wrote that Nintendo forgot about was Donkey Kong, so I was happy to see it come back on the Switch 2. Donkey Kong Bananza is a new 3D platforming game featuring the Nintendo mascot, and it looks like something brand-new and not just another entry in the Donkey Kong Country franchise. Nintendo did give a release date of July 17 for Donkey Kong's new game, and I can't wait.\nElden Ring Tarnished Edition\nFromSoftware had a double whammy of games during the Switch 2 Direct. Even though this is a port of Elden Ring, the Tarnished Edition includes the original game as well as the DLC, Shadows of the Erdtree.\nCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition\nCyberpunk 2077 is an amazing game and having that playable on a handheld console will be a sight to see. It took multiple patches to get the games to run smoothly on the Steam Deck, but if it can run well right out of the box on the Switch 2, it will be a game to pick up.\nProject 007\nThis was another surprise from the Nintendo Direct stream. IO Interactive is developing the new Bond game, but not much other than the working title has been revealed. Still, with a studio like IO Interactive working on the game, it's easy to be excited for another Bond game.\nHere are some of the other games shown on Wednesday that I'm excited for:\n- Sid Meier's Civilization VII (Nintendo Switch 2 Edition)\n- Split Fiction\n- Street Fighter 6\n- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Nintendo Switch 2 Edition)\n- The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Nintendo Switch 2 Edition)\n- Yakuza 0 Director's Cut\n- Shadow Labyrinth (Nintendo Switch 2 Edition)\n- Nobunaga's Ambition: Awakening Complete Edition\n- Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4\n- Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment\n- Marvel Cosmic Invasion\n- Pokémon Legends: Z-A (Nintendo Switch 2 Edition)\n- Borderlands 4\n- Kirby Air Riders\n- Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (Nintendo Switch 2 Edition)\nThe Switch 2 launches on June 5, and preorders will be available at retailers starting on April 9. To prevent scalpers from buying most of the Switch 2 stock, Nintendo implemented some interesting requirements for those who want to buy a Switch 2 from the company.",
