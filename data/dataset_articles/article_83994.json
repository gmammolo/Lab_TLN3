  "text": "English tuning giants Severn Valley Motorsport have created the ultimate Navara by transplanting the VR35DETT engine from the R 35 GT-R, in lieu of the pedestrian 2.3-litre turbo-diesel.\nThe work goes far beyond a mere transplant, with power bumped up to 800hp (596kW). Plenty of other tuning options are available too, with the company claiming that a face-melting 1500hp(1120kW) is also available if your wallet is fat enough.\nThis NP300 also adopts the GT-R’s dual-clutch transmission and all-wheel drive drivetrain, with the capability of installing a manual gearbox also being mentioned.\nExternally, a deep chin front end and bodykit with matt and red highlights completes the visual package and sets the tradies’ favourite apart from the worksite special.\nAs one might expect, the price for this insanity is stratospheric; £175,000 (AU$328,000), for something which would make a Maloo wet its bed and destroy its bedliner in the process.\nLuke Anthony from the company said: “we are open to the craziest of ideas”, so sky’s the limit when it comes to turning the Navara workhorse into a mind-blowingly fast machine. Speaking of which, there is no mention of performance figures or quarter mile times at this point.\nThis Navara is not the only vehicle to feature a GT-R driveline swap; the famous Nissan Juke-R came with the twin-turbo engine, installed and engineered for fun by Nissan Europe engineers.",
