  "text": "Founded by Gema Cabañero (Forbes Women 2024), a renowned expert in aesthetics and anti-aging, 180 the concept is a Spanish brand at the forefront of advanced nutricosmetic solutions. With over 30 years of dedicated research into the biological and cellular processes of aging, Cabañero has developed the High Precision Aesthetic Method in 6D®, a comprehensive approach that addresses the internal biological factors contributing to external aesthetic concerns. This method integrates insights from nutrition, aesthetics, pharmacy, biology, and chemistry, creating personalized anti-aging regimens tailored to individual needs.\nA Visionary Recognized for Scientific Excellence\nGema Cabañero's pioneering work in the beauty and wellness industry has earned her prestigious accolades, including the Collaborative Innovation Excellence Award from Spain’s National Research Council (CSIC). This recognition highlights her authority in developing scientifically-backed beauty solutions.\nThrough extensive clinical research involving thousands of cases, Gema identified that visible aging signs, such as skin laxity and bone loss, are driven by a cascade of dysfunctions in cellular organelles and macromolecular metabolism imbalances.\nRather than focusing on isolated aging markers, she pioneered a systemic intervention model, integrating insights from 12 key aging hallmarks into the development of the 6-Dimensional Nutritional System. To further strengthen the scientific foundation of her work,Gema collaborated with Nobel Prize-winning scientists George F. Smoot and Randy W. Schekman, aswell as scientists associated with CSIC research groups. These collaborations cement 180 the concept as a leader in scientific anti-aging innovation.\nH6 2.0 's New Efficacy: The Three-Dimensional Anti-Aging Network\nAt the core of H6 Capsules 2.0 is the Three-Dimensional Anti-Aging Network, designed to support facial bone structure longevity through three fundamental pillars:\n1. Stabilization\nThe upgraded HGH Activation Complex 2.0 works to stimulate endogenous growth hormone production. This addresses age-related bone density loss, reinforcing facial structure and providing a stable foundation for youthful contours.\n2. Lifting\nThe proprietary Isometric-Lifting Group restores dermal-fascial anchoring, enhancing the skin-fiber elasticity and mechanical stability necessary for a firmer, sculpted facial contour.\n3. Cellular Noutriment\nThe Cell Plant System 2.0 targets mitochondria, optimizing cellular metabolism and reversing mitochondrial dysfunction. This process improves skin vitality and helps maintain a youthful appearance by addressing the root causes of aging at the cellular level.\nEvidence: Clinically Proven Results\nThe effectiveness of H6 Capsules 2.0 has been validated by SGS, a global leader in scientific testing and certification. In a 28-day clinical study with 56 female participants, aged 30 to 60, visible contour lifting was achieved, with significant improvements in skin firmness and elasticity. The results confirm:\n- Visible contour lifting in just 28 days, with measurable improvements in skin firmness and elasticity.\nThis clinical validation provides real-world evidence that further solidifies 180 the concept’s position as a leader in nutricosmetic innovation and underscores the integration of scientific expertise in developing anti-aging solutions.\nShaping the Future of Nutricosmetic Solutions\nThe launch of H6 Capsules 2.0 marks a significant shift in 180 the concept’s approach, from general oral beauty to a highly specialized strategy focusing on bone structure anti-aging. By introducing its Six-Dimensional Nutritional Positioning System, the brand leads the next evolution in the nutricosmetic industry, setting a new standard for precision anti-aging.\nThis approach moves beyond superficial skincare and aims for a more holistic rejuvenation, with a focus on scientific rigor, Nobel Prize collaborations, and real-world clinical validation.\nFor more details, visit 180 the concept Official Website: WWW.180theconcept.com\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Globalnewsonline\nContact Person: Hysan Jiang\nEmail: Send Email\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: http://www.globalnewsonline.info/\nStock Quote API & Stock News API supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nand .",
