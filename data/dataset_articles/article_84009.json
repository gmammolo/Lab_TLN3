This teed up a day of Switch 2 reveals that include its June 5 release date, a $450 price, its specs, and its initial game lineup that extends from launch into 2026 .\nThe console will be further buoyed by having Mario Kart World as a launch title, which will go on sale in either a $500 bundle with the Switch 2 or on its own for $80 -- making the open-world racing game one of Nintendo&apos;s most expensive yet. Other games announced, such as Donkey Kong Bananza, are being priced around $70, which matches the cost of 2023&apos;s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. That Zelda game and Breath of the Wild are among the original Switch titles that will get enhanced Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades , a premium upgrade allowing players to get new features, modes and graphical enhancements that take advantage of the newer system&apos;s capabilities.\nHere are the top highlights from Nintendo&apos;s console event, all of the games we&apos;ve heard about so far (including new titles, Nintendo Switch 2 Edition titles and GameCube games coming to Nintendo Switch Online ) and all of our coverage so far. You can also check out our Nintendo Switch 2 live blog for even more updates about the Switch 2 as we learn them.\nNintendo Switch 2 Direct Live Recap: Launches June 5, $450 and More Nintendo Switch 2 Priced at $450, Coming June 5 How to Preorder Nintendo Switch 2: All Store Links All Nintendo Switch 2 Launch Games Coming Day One Nintendo Is Taking on Scalpers With a Genius Switch 2 Purchase Rule What You Need to Know About Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Games Switch 2 Specs vs. Switch 1 Specs: How Nintendo&apos;s Consoles Compare Every New Feature in Switch 2 Joy-Cons and Pro Controller\nGameCube Games Are Coming to Switch Online: Here&apos;s the List Nintendo Switch 2: What We Didn&apos;t Get During Nintendo Direct 2025 Mario Kart Goes Open-World With Mario Kart World The Duskbloods Is New FromSoftware Gaming Action Coming to Switch 2 in 2026 The Nintendo Switch 2 Is Almost Here, Grab Some Games From Just $20 to Celebrate Yes, Silksong Is Coming in 2025, as Revealed in Switch 2 Nintendo Direct Mario, Pokemon and More Will Get Free Nintendo Switch 2 Updates Switch 2&apos;s Zelda Notes Could Revolutionize Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Wait for the Switch 2 Before Playing These 3 Nintendo Games Nintendo Switch 2: Here&apos;s Why I Won&apos;t Be Upgrading as a Fan of Cozy Games The Switch 2 Is Almost Here and You Need a Specific Type of MicroSD Card - Here&apos;s Where to Find Them Nintendo Switch 2 console The Nintendo Switch 2&apos;s specs saw a noticeable technical bump over the Switch. The Nintendo Switch 2 has a 7.9-inch, 1080p resolution LCD that supports a 120Hz refresh rate -- matching what we now see on most Android phones. When the Switch 2 is docked, compatible games can run in 4K resolution. The new dock also includes a cooling fan.\nThe Switch 2 comes with 256GB of internal storage, and the new Switch 2 Game Cards will load games faster. For digital libraries, however, the Switch 2 will only work with microSD Express cards, which are different from the microSD cards that are compatible with the prior Nintendo Switch. Nintendo will have a Software Transfer feature available to help move games and data from the original Switch to the Switch 2.\nWatch this: Switch 2 Detailed: What You Need to Know 07:18 The new Joy-Con for the controllers will support mouse controls, and a new C button will be part of a new GameChat communication feature that allows both voice and video chat. There&apos;s also a Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, allowing players to see each other.\nThe Switch 2 also adds a second USB-C port to the top of the system, which Nintendo says can help connect its new camera accessory or charge the console when playing in tabletop mode. Nintendo also revealed a new Switch 2 Pro Controller with the C button and customizable GL and GR buttons on the back.\nFollowing the presentation, Nintendo unveiled the system&apos;s price of $450 in the US. It will also sell the Switch 2 bundled with a digital version of Mario Kart World for $500.\nNintendo Mario Kart World Mario Kart World removes its traditional boundaries and lets drivers roam freely across an entire world of race courses. The game will get its own Nintendo Direct later this month, where we&apos;ll see additional details, but we already know it&apos;ll include traditional races and a Free Roam mode, much like in the Forza Horizon series .\nGetting the game bundled for an extra $50 on the cost of the Switch 2 might be the move if you are interested in the game, because Nintendo announced on its website that standalone copies of Mario Kart World will cost $80 .\nNintendo/Screenshot by CNET Joy-Con 2 C button and GameChat Nintendo&apos;s rolling out its new C button across several new Switch 2 controllers . The button will be used for the new GameChat communication features without a headset. The button will be used alongside a microphone on the console itself, which Nintendo says can be used whether it&apos;s docked to a TV or in handheld mode.\nWatch this: Live Video Chat Comes to the Nintendo Switch 2 05:43 In its teaser video, Nintendo promises the microphone will be able to cancel out loud background noises. GameChat will also work with a Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, allowing video chat and various camera-based game modes in supported titles. GameChat will be free at launch through March 31, 2026.\nNintendo/Screenshot by CNET Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games upgrade titles The Nintendo Switch 2 will play three types of games: original Switch games, Switch 2 games and Switch 2 Edition games that will receive substantial enhancements. For many of these Switch 2 Edition games, you&apos;ll need to buy an upgrade pack if you own the original for Switch. Many of them will get more than just enhanced graphics in the upgrade; for example, Super Mario Party Jamboree will get new games that support the new Joy-Cons&apos; mouse controls, audio recognition and video camera gameplay options through the Switch 2 Camera.\nOther Nintendo Switch games that are getting Switch 2 Edition options include The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Metroid Prime 4 Beyond and Pokemon Legends: Z-A. Enhancements vary: The Zelda games will start working with a companion phone app for maps and sending schematics to friends, while Kirby will get a new story that&apos;s exclusive to the Switch 2 Edition. On the third-party side, Civilization 7 will get mouse controls.\nNintendo did not announce what upgrade packs will cost. However, some Switch games will get free updates that will improve performance or enhance features when playing them on the Switch 2. The Switch games getting these updates include:\nArms Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker Super Mario Odyssey Super Mario 3D World + Bowser&apos;s Fury Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics The Legend of Zelda: Link&apos;s Awakening The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Game Builder Garage New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe Pokemon Scarlet Pokemon Violet Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is a new game set in the world of Zelda that tells the story that leads into The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. This appears to be similar to how Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity told the story of a war that led to the events of Breath of the Wild. The teaser shows Zelda discovering that she&apos;s arrived in the past of Hyrule, and the game will expand on how she gets involved in the corresponding Imprisonment War.\nNintendo Switch 2 games Several other first- and third-party games were spotlighted during the Switch 2 Direct. These include Donkey Bananza, one of the first 3D platforming games featuring DK since 1999&apos;s Donkey Kong 64. Kirby will also return to the racing genre in Kirby Air Riders, which comes more than 20 years after the GameCube racer Kirby&apos;s Air Ride. DragXDrive will use mouse controls to control a futuristic wheelchair basketball game in which players will simulate push and pull motions to control their character.\nAn onslaught of Switch 2 third-party games were quickly shuffled through during the Direct, which I list below. An unnamed James Bond game is in development at Hitman studio IO Interactive, as is a darker title from Elden Ring creator FromSoftware called The Duskbloods , which will be exclusive to the Switch 2.\nThe full list of announced Nintendo Switch 2 games includes:\nBorderlands 4 Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Deltarune Donkey Kong Bananza Drag x Drive EA Sports FC EA Sports Madden NFL Elden Ring Tarnished Edition Enter the Gungeon 2 Fast Fusion Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade Fortnite Hades 2 Hitman World of Assassination -- Signature Edition Hogwarts Legacy Hollow Knight: Silksong Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Kirby Air Riders Kirby and the Forgotten Land -- Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and Star-Crossed World Kunitsu-Gai: Path of the Goddess Mario Kart World Metroid Prime 4: Beyond -- Nintendo Switch 2 Edition NBA 2K Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Nobunaga&apos;s Ambition: Awakening Complete Edition Pokemon Legends: Z-A -- Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Project 007 Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma -- Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Sid Meier&apos;s Civilization 7 -- Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Split Fiction Star Wars Outlaws Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions Street Fighter 6 Super Mario Party Jamboree -- Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and Jamboree TV Survival Kids The Duskbloods The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild -- Nintendo Switch 2 Edition The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom -- Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Tony Hawk&apos;s Pro Skater 3 and 4 WWE 2K Yakuza 0 Definitive Edition Among these titles, you can see the full list of June 5 Switch 2 launch day games here .\nNintendo GameCube library coming to Switch 2 The Nintendo Switch Online game library will add GameCube games to the Switch 2 . On launch day, these games will initially include The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, SoulCalibur 2 and F-Zero GX, with each game getting enhanced graphics. Online multiplayer will also be added to certain titles. Super Mario Sunshine, Super Mario Strikers and Luigi&apos;s Mansion are among the games set to arrive later. At launch, Nintendo will also sell a GameCube controller, which will be wireless and include a C button for GameChat.",
