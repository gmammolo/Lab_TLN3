  "text": "MOBERLY — More than 30 planes flew in and out of Omar N. Bradley Regional Airport in Moberly for the sixth stop in the 47th annual Air Race Classic.\nForty-seven aircrafts are still in the race, which spans approximately 2,400 miles across the country. The race is exclusively for teams of two women pilots with ages ranging from 17 to the oldest pilot at 95 years old.\nThe race is classified as a handicapped race, meaning there are planes of different types and speeds, and each type of plane is assigned a handicap speed. Each team's goal is to beat their plane's handicap speed by the most. The team who beats their plane handicap speed by the most is the winner.\n\"That system allows all of us to race together, which has been a really, really exciting time,\" said Piper aircraft pilot Carly Shukiar.\nPiper aircraft pilots Carly Schukiar (right) and Lucy Freeman (left) prepare their plane for the journey to Oklahoma at the airport in Moberly during the 2024 Air Race Classic.\nRyan Blakely, KOMU 8 Reporter Along with trying to record a fast time, pilots also share another goal: to be an inspiration for young girls in aviation.\nSuccess!
