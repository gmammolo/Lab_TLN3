  "text": "Nintendo has announced details for the highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2, marking the company's first new console since the original Switch in 2017. Priced at $450, the Switch 2 will be available starting June 5. It will be sold separately or as part of a bundle with the new game \"Mario Kart World,\" designed specifically for the Switch 2.\nThe Switch 2 retains the hybrid design of its predecessor, allowing gameplay both on-the-go and connected to a TV. It features a larger 1080p LCD screen with up to 120 frames per second and HDR support, although some may miss the OLED screen. The console supports 4K resolution when docked and offers 256GB of storage, expandable via microSD express cards.\nNew Joy-Con controllers are heavier and attach magnetically to the screen. They can also function as a computer mouse in compatible games, thanks to gyro controls. A new \"GameChat\" feature allows voice communication during gameplay, free until March 2026.\nIn addition to \"Mario Kart World,\" the Switch 2 will support games from other developers, including \"Hades 2,\" \"Elden Ring,\" and \"Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition.\" A new Zelda game, \"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,\" will also be released.",
