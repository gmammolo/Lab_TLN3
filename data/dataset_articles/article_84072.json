  "text": "NEWARK (WABC) -- New Jersey is fighting back against deceptive AI photos, videos and audio known as deepfakes.\nOn Wednesday, Governor Phil Murphy signed legislation that establishes civil and criminal penalties for people who produce the material.\nThe new law was partially inspired by an incident at a high school where a student used AI to place their classmates' photos on pornographic images.\n16-year-old Francesca took her fight to lawmakers after being the target of an explicit AI-generated deepfake image.\n\"This law is for every woman and teen dismissed with nothing happening or just move on,\" Francesca Mani said.\nTwo years ago, she and 29 other students found out a boy at Westfield High posted pornographic images that were not real.\nHe was suspended for a day, but Mani refused to settle and she went on a mission.\n\"There are boys using this technology, but there are also criminals and pedophiles and just creeps altogether. So it's a bigger issue than that the lack of laws and legislation really meant something to Francesca,\" her mom Dorota Mani said.\nGovernor Murphy signed the new law making posting non-consensual deepfakes a crime in New Jersey.\nHe says it is needed to keep young people safe.\n\"Just about any bad actor can use artificial intelligence at any time to produce hyperrealistic images and videos that could exploit children, teenagers and frankly anyone,\" Murphy said.\nThe hope is that New Jersey's law will become a federal law.\nThe law also addresses the issue of AI deepfakes being used in politics to deceive voters.\n\"Deepfakes are a powerful tool for deception capable of undermining public trust,\" New Jersey Lt. Governor Tahesha Way said.\n\"Francesca, your case and cases like yours frankly brought to light a gap in our criminal laws and in our civil laws that left our residents vulnerable to real harm,\" New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin said.\nThis new law contains very serious penalties for perpetrators, including up to 5 years behind bars and a $30,000 fine.\n* Get Eyewitness News Delivered\n* Follow us on YouTube\n* More local news\n* Send us a news tip\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts\nSubmit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?
