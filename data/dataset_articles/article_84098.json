  "text": "Two Harvard roommates are using an AI-driven matching process to connect Hispanic immigrants with job opportunities suited to their skills. For many Hispanic immigrants arriving in the US, securing employment is far more complex than simply submitting a CV. Language barriers, complex applications, and limited access to technology often make the process overwhelming—even for those legally authorised to work. In a system that fails to accommodate one of the country's fastest-growing demographics, two Colombian entrepreneurs saw an opportunity to make a difference. Their Miami-based start-up, Ponte, is using AI and WhatsApp to revolutionise job access for Hispanic immigrants—and they're only just getting started.\nHow Ponte Targets Its Audience\nPonte connects workers with jobs in the hospitality, construction and retail sectors—industries where Hispanic immigrants are already heavily represented. To reach these workers, the platform employs a focused marketing strategy that uses Facebook and Instagram ads, and crucially, WhatsApp, which is widely used among the Hispanic population. The result? A 95% Hispanic user base with more than 60,000 jobseekers on the platform.\nPonte is not a staffing agency. It does not employ workers directly, nor does it take a cut of their wages from day one. Instead, employers are only charged 10% of the monthly salary for up to 12 months—but only after the worker has been employed for at least 30 days. This success-based model makes the platform risk-free for both jobseekers and employers.\nAI-Driven Matching and Trust-Building\nFor employers, Ponte offers more than just access to labour—it provides pre-screened, vetted candidates with verified work authorisation. Using voice-based AI interviews and WhatsApp communication, Ponte ensures that applicants match…\nAndrea Tode Jimenez",
