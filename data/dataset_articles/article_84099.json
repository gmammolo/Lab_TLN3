  "text": "Lotus is gearing up to launch the latest versions of the Eletre and Emeya this summer. The updated models have new 600 and 900 variants as well as established trim levels. The Emeya 900 has a dual-motor all-wheel drive system with a combined output of 905 hp. Lotus is gearing up to launch the 2026 Eletre and Emeya this summer, and the company has announced a handful of welcome changes. While the updates aren’t too dramatic, they better communicate power and equipment.\nAs part of the change, there are new “600” and “900” monikers. The former has a dual-motor all-wheel drive system with 603 hp (450 kW / 612 PS), while the latter boasts 905 hp (675 kW / 918 PS).\nMore: Lotus Eletre Priced At A Shocking $229,900 Due To New Chinese EV Tariffs\nThat isn’t the only revision as Lotus has established six “clearly defined trim levels” called the 600, 600 GT, 600 GT SE, 600 Sport SE, 900 Sport, and 900 Sport Carbon. While the availability of these trims varies by market, they help to establish a hierarchy.\nThe entry-level Eletre 600 comes equipped with LED lighting units, 20-inch wheels, and an active air suspension. They’re joined by a 29-inch head-up display, a 15-speaker audio system, and a four-zone climate control system. Customers will also find a Jasper interior with LotusWear Performance Fabric seats.\nThe 600 GT adds larger 22-inch wheels, six-piston brake calipers, highway assist, and a parking package. The 600 GT SE goes even further with an electrochromic glass roof, illuminated side sills, adjustable ambient lighting, and an upgraded 23-speaker audio system. The 600 Sport SE takes things in a more dynamic direction thanks to a handling package, an active rear spoiler, soft-close doors, and upgraded front seats featuring ventilation and massage functions.\nThe Eletre 900 Sport is essentially a high-performance and decontented version of the Sport SE, while the 900 Sport Carbon adds interior and exterior carbon fiber trim, a composite hood, soft-close doors, and the aforementioned front seats.\nThe Emeya trims are largely identical, but the model has a larger 51-inch head-up display as well as different wheels that appear to max out at 21-inches.\nAside from the new names and trims, the Eletre features a revised color palette. It now includes Akoya White and Zenith White.\nIn terms of performance, the Emeya 600 accelerates from 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) in 4.15 seconds before hitting a top speed of 155 mph (250 km/h). Likewise, the Eletre 600 hits 62 mph (100 km/h) in 4.5 seconds and can eventually top out at 159 mph (256 km/h).\nThe 900 variants have the same top speeds, but the Emeya 900 hits 62 mph (100 km/h) in a mere 2.78 seconds. The Eletre 900 accomplishes the task shortly thereafter at 2.95 seconds.\nThe Emeya has a 102 kWh battery pack that allows for a WLTP range of up to 379 miles (610 km). The Eletre’s 112 kWh unit allows for a slightly less impressive range of 373 miles (600 km).\nBoth models are currently available to order and UK pricing starts at £84,990 for both the Eletre and Emeya.",
