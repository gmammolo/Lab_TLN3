One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Giga-Byte Technology (TWSE:2376) so let's look a bit deeper.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Giga-Byte Technology is:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.17 = NT$13b ÷ (NT$111b - NT$37b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\nTherefore, Giga-Byte Technology has an ROCE of 17%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.5% generated by the Tech industry.\n Check out our latest analysis for Giga-Byte Technology\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Giga-Byte Technology compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Giga-Byte Technology .\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\nThe trends we've noticed at Giga-Byte Technology are quite reassuring. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 17%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 196% more capital is being employed now too. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.\nOur Take On Giga-Byte Technology's ROCE\nTo sum it up, Giga-Byte Technology has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And a remarkable 526% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.\nOne more thing: We've identified 2 warning signs with Giga-Byte Technology (at least 1 which doesn't sit too well with us) , and understanding these would certainly be useful.\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\nNew: Manage All Your Stock Portfolios in One Place\nWe've created the ultimate portfolio companion for stock investors, and it's free.\n• Connect an unlimited number of Portfolios and see your total in one currency\n• Be alerted to new Warning Signs or Risks via email or mobile\n• Track the Fair Value of your stocks\nTry a Demo Portfolio for Free\nHave feedback on this article?
