  "text": "WEDNESDAY, April 2, 2025 (HealthDay News) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Qfitlia (fitusiran) for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with hemophilia A or hemophilia B, with or without factor VIII or IX inhibitors (neutralizing antibodies). Subcutaneous Qfitlia does not replace the missing coagulation factor VIII or IX, but reduces the amount of the protein antithrombin, leading to an increase in thrombin, an enzyme critical for blood clotting. Dosing starts at once every two months and is based on the FDA-cleared INNOVANCE Antithrombin companion diagnostic test (Siemens). Fixed dosing of Qfitlia is not approved due to excessive clotting risk. Qfitlia has a boxed warning for thrombotic events and gallbladder disease. The most common side effects reported were viral infection, nasopharyngitis, and bacterial infection. Javascript is required for you to be able to read premium content.
