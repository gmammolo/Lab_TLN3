  "text": "TAMPA, Fla. — Life-like is the word heard often inside the SynDaver building in Tampa.\nWhat You Need To Know SynDaver , a Tampa based company, produces synthetic anatomy technology\nThe human and animal models are designed for both general education and medical training, and can be equipped to simulate specialized surgical procedures\nThis technology is designed to replace traditional cadavers and eliminate the need for live animal use in training and education The company’s synthetic human and animal models are widely used in medical device testing, veterinary training, and STEM education programs around the globe Human and animal models are built to such anatomical likeness that future doctors and veterinarians practice on them during their educational years.\n“This is about as lifelike as you’re going to get, right? \"Our synthetic tissue model that you see here, comprised mostly of water, salt and fibers, but the ideal thing here is that the tissues actually mimic live tissue,” said SynDaver's VP of global sales and marketing Tom Ewing.\nSynDaver sells these models for classroom use in general education and for medical training. The models can even be used to simulate specialized surgical procedures.\nOne of the main reasons for synthetic models like this in the medical world is to replace cadavers.\nEach model is handmade by artisans that work at SynDaver. The company’s newest model, the G2 SynTissue Anatomy model is built with a new type of synthetic tissue. It also has abdominal vasculature, improved organs and even ligaments.\nThis type of medical education is becoming more and more prevalent.\nAs for cost, it varies depending on the model. The newest one is in the ballpark of $75,000.\nSynDaver says they do now have financial options, with its new partner Blue Street Capitol.\nFor more information about SynDaver or the company’s products, visit the company's website .",
