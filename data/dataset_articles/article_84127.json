  "text": "Summary\n- PS5 system update increases wishlist slots from 100 to 188, a small but welcome quality-of-life addition.\n- Changelog of PS5 system update includes activity details, Unicode 16.0 emojis support, and improved system performance.\n- Sony's new PS5 firmware patch aims to enhance system usability, with rumors of a Gears of War Collection release in August.\nWhile it's normal for Sony to release firmware updates to the PlayStation 5, we usually get a changelog of what has changed, unless it's your standard stability update.\nThe latest system patch by Sony for the PS5 added a host of improvements, and tucked underneath is another quality-of-life addition that might have gone unnoticed.\nRelated\n Rumor: Gears of War Collection Loaded Into PlayStation Store Backend, But One Major Feature Is Missing\nGears of War Collection has allegedly been uploaded on the PlayStation Store backend and is set for release in August.\nPlayStation Store Functionality Improved With Latest PS5 System Update\nOne redditor spotted a minor but welcome change in the new PS5 firmware patch that was undocumented. Before, gamers were limited to 100 games on their PSN wishlists, and after the patch, it has since been increased to 188.\nIt's nothing groundbreaking, but it's still a nice improvement.\nThe official changelog of that update included:\n- We’ve made it simpler to view details about activities.\n- Activity details are now fully displayed on cards.\n- Potential spoilers will still be hidden.\n- Unicode 16.0 emojis are now supported. You can use them in your messages.\n- When you set the parental controls’ restriction level to Late Teens or Older, Communication and User-Generated Content will now default to Restrict. If you have previously set the level to Late Teens or Older, your previous settings will not be affected and it will be shown as Customize.\n- We’ve improved system software performance and stability.\n- We’ve improved the messages and usability on some screens.\nIf you don't use the PSN Store's wishlist feature, it's essentially a \"deal watcher\" of some sort. When someone adds a game to their wishlist, they will be notified if that game gets a sale. However, a specific game variant needs to be wishlisted. If you wishlist the base game, and it's Deluxe Edition gets the discount, you won't be notified. The added slots with the system update should let players be a bit more liberal in the games they add.\nRelated\n PlayStation Gamers Should Check Their Emails For A Freebie They Might Not Know Exists\nPS4 and PS5 gamers might have overlooked a freebie from PlayStation that some are just noticing now.\nThere's no word on when the next PS5 system update is due for release, or what will be in it, though Sony did announce a new beta program last month, which aims to have PS5 and PC players test out upcoming firmware patches.\nIf you're looking to snag a PS5, one retailer has a special sale on the PS5 slim that even has one heck of a freebie. There's also the PSN Store Spring sale ongoing now that has games discounted by up to 70% off.\nRelated\n PlayStation Plus Extra's Latest Games Lineup Pulls Sony Out Of 3-Month Funk\nMarch's PS Plus games proved popular enough to see a significant uptick in subscriptions.",
