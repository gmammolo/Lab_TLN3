  "text": "Ripple has integrated RLUSD into its enterprise-grade cross-border payments platform, Ripple Payments, amid a 118% monthly growth in its market cap.\nThe move expands US-pegged RLUSD’s utility within Ripple’s global transaction infrastructure and coincides with the token’s listing on Kraken , further increasing access to institutional and retail users.\nBased on Artemis data , RLUSD’s market cap jumped to nearly $200 million in March, three months after its rollout in December 2024 .\nAdditionally, the stablecoin’s monthly transfer volume increased from $466 million to over $720 million last month, a 54.6% growth.\nCross-border payments with RLUSD The integration with Ripple Payments is part of a phased rollout. Select customers, including BKK Forex and iSend, are already utilizing RLUSD for cross-border treasury operations.\nRipple’s SVP of stablecoins, Jack McDonald, said RLUSD is increasingly being used across crypto-native and traditional finance markets, including as collateral for tokenized real-world assets.\nThe announcement noted that RLUSD is tailored for institutional flows, unlike retail-focused stablecoins. Ripple plans to expand RLUSD’s role in its payment system to additional enterprise customers over time.\nKraken listing extends market access Kraken’s listing of RLUSD marks the token’s availability on another major centralized exchange, joining previous LMAX Digital, Bitstamp, Zero Hash, and Bullish listings.\nThe listing broadens RLUSD’s market footprint and enables individual traders to access the asset through a trusted US exchange.\nIn January, Ripple partnered with Chainlink to add RLUSD data feeds to the decentralized finance ecosystem, enhancing its use by retail.\nThe integration of RLUSD into Ripple Payments and its listing on Kraken also reflect Ripple’s broader effort to bridge crypto infrastructure with regulated financial markets.",
