Impressive, right?\nThe 9 also looks the part – it has a broad stance which is enhanced by 134 LED daytime running lights up the front and a large front grille.\nInside, you’ll find a 24.6-inch display sprawled across the dashboard, which is divided into an infotainment touchscreen and an instrument panel.\nThe car also features heated and ventilated seats, a huge sunroof, a Sony surround sound system, and double-glazed windows – making that low price point all the more impressive.\nDISCOVER SBX CARS:\nThe global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie\nClaire Reid is a journalist who hails from the UK but is now living in New Zealand.
