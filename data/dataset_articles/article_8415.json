  "text": "Las Vegas man gets free HVAC system after no air conditioning for a year LAS VEGAS, Nev. (FOX5) - As Southern Nevada once again braces for triple digit temperatures, it is crucial to remain indoors and stay in air conditioning. However, many people in the Las Vegas Valley are without that necessity. On Friday, an organization called Rebuilding Together Southern Nevada stepped up gave a local man a new HVAC system. “No money no honey,” is the motto 74-year-old Ben tells FOX5 he lives by. However, things are about to get a little sweeter and cooler for him. “It is very hot very terrible,” he said. “Afternoon it is like a oven inside.” Ben has been without air conditioning for a year and tells FOX5 he takes up to three showers a day just to stay cool inside his mobile home. “Not having air for over a year is something I couldn’t even fathom,” Danny Hundly with Bull Dog Air Conditioning and Heating said. “The furnace in this home is from the 70s.” Hundly and Bob Cleveland with Rebuilding Together Southern Nevada stepped in to help Ben. “We came out and qualified him as being low income and we are able to replace his air conditioner at no cost,” Cleveland said. Cleveland said Ben was just one of many in Southern Nevada waiting for some relief. “It’s desperate, we have a waiting list in every one of the municipality,” Cleveland said. Cleveland tells FOX5 he believes there are many who don’t know about his organization. But with the help of his neighbor, Ben was able to trust that the organization was legitimate. Rebuilding Together Southern Nevada said they started off helping 200 people a year, but this year they have helped 1,000 residents and expect that number to grow. To qualify for help from them you must be either low income, a home owner, a veteran, disabled, or a senior. You could learn more [ here](https://rtsnv.org/). Copyright 2024 KVVU.
