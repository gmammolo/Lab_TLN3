  "text": "United States, April 2, 2025 -- Art and technology are no longer separate worlds — they are converging to shape the future of spatial experiences. At the forefront of this transformation is Yevhen BROKHIN, the founder of Collab, whose phygital art solutions push the boundaries of how people interact with environments. By seamlessly integrating physical and digital elements, BROKHIN crafts immersive experiences for private residences, luxury hotels, wellness centers, hospitals, and brand showrooms, contributing to a new paradigm in contemporary art and design.\nPhygital art — the fusion of physical and digital realities — has become a defining force in contemporary art and design. At the same time, the term was first introduced by Momentum in 2013, and its true potential is only now being realized, thanks to rapid technological evolution and the growing demand for immersive, data-driven experiences. Unlike the speculative NFT market, phygital art offers tangible, interactive installations that have already demonstrated lasting value in real-world settings. While platforms like OpenSea have faced challenges, the demand for art that bridges tangible and intangible experiences has surged. According to Art Basel and UBS research, collectors increasingly value the combination of physical artworks with digital interactivity, creating a unique opportunity for artists like Yevhen BROKHIN to pioneer new creative frontiers.\nThe driving force behind Collab is Yevhen BROKHIN — widely regarded as a visionary artist and an early adopter of generative art practices who have harnessed algorithms and Data Painting to create truly unique art experiences and connect with audiences on a profound level. Collab’s Media Frames, merging artistic experimentation with real-time responsiveness, reflects this approach. These frames are constantly evolving, shaped by real-time data and personal narratives. BROKHIN transforms static spaces into responsive environments by merging algorithmic precision with human emotion. He delivers bespoke art that resonates deeply with individuals and enhances the ambiance of any space.\nIn 2024, Collab played a central role in Nuanu City — an ambitious solarpunk urban concept in Bali. Collaborating with architects and immersive tech artists, BROKHIN helped transform entire districts into interactive, revenue-generating cultural destinations, showcasing how phygital art can shape the identity of future cities. One of the central works in this initiative was Earth Sentinels — a pair of 14-meter sculptures by Daniel Popper, enhanced by BROKHIN’s multimedia layer using projection mapping, light, and sound.\n“It’s the kind of beauty that shows people and politicians — who may disregard art as ‘nice to have’ and the artist as a subclass — the true power and importance of art and artists,” said entrepreneur Kyle Kesterson, reflecting on BROKHIN’s impact in Nuanu.\nCollab’s phygital art solutions are designed to elevate a wide range of environments, offering tailored experiences that align with the unique needs of each setting:\n- Private Residences: Art that breathes. In homes, Collab’s Media Frames provide homeowners with dynamic, personalized art that adapts to their preferences and moods. These frames transform living spaces into immersive galleries, enriching everyday life with visually captivating displays.\n- Hotels: Enhancing hospitality spaces through artistic and technological integration . By seamlessly integrating with a hotel’s brand identity, Collab’s artworks turn lobbies, suites, and common areas into captivating experiences guests will never forget.\n- Wellness Centers: Collab’s art promotes relaxation and mindfulness in wellness spaces. Inspired by nature and soothing aesthetics, these artworks contribute to a calming atmosphere, supporting emotional well-being and enhancing the overall wellness experience.\n- Hospitals: Thanks to Collab's art installations, hospitals are no longer sterile environments. Research shows that art can reduce stress and improve patient recovery, and BROKHIN’s phygital art brings warmth and comfort to healthcare settings.\n- Brand Showrooms: Collab’s Media Frames offer brands a powerful tool to amplify identity and engage customers. BROKHIN’s work enhances customer engagement and sets brands apart in competitive markets by showcasing brand narratives through dynamic, interactive art.\nCollab isn’t just contributing to the evolution of art — it’s changing how people experience space. With Yevhen BROKHIN at the helm, phygital art is no longer a speculative concept; it is fast becoming a standard in experiential design. By merging the physical and digital realms, BROKHIN redefines artistic expression and influences how individuals engage with environments. Collab’s commitment to innovation and personalized experiences ensures that phygital art will remain a driving force in the art and design industries for years.\nA vivid example is Meduza — a 7000-square-foot hologram developed with Placebo25, currently the largest in Europe. Featuring contributions from over 15 international artists, it set a new benchmark in large-scale immersive media.\nCollab’s mission extends beyond aesthetics. A 2023 digital art initiative led by BROKHIN in collaboration with the duo 404.zero raised over $6.6 million to support children with special needs, illustrating how phygital art can create measurable social impact.\nContact Info:\nName: Nataliya Zozulya\nEmail: Send Email\nOrganization: Yevhen BROKHIN - Collab\nWebsite: https://collab.wtf\nRelease ID: 89156563\nIn case of encountering any inaccuracies, problems, or queries arising from the content shared in this press release that necessitate action, or if you require assistance with a press release takedown, we urge you to notify us at error@releasecontact.com (it is important to note that this email is the authorized channel for such matters, sending multiple emails to multiple addresses does not necessarily help expedite your request).
