  "text": "Season 3 of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 gives players a blast from the past as not only does fan favorite character Jason Hudson make a return, but Verdansk, the original Battle Royale map for Warzone , makes its long-awaited return to celebrate the game’s 5th birthday. Along with the inclusion of a brand-new Zombies map, this season is packed with new content. Among this content is a new Battle Pass with over 100 items to unlock. Before jumping headfirst into the new season, players will want to know what to expect in the new Battle Pass, so allow me to break it down! This guide will provide a full list of all the content in the Season 3 Battle Pass of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone .\nFull List of All Season 3 Battle Pass Content In Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3 of Black Ops 6 continues using the new Page System for its Battle Pass. This system was first implemented in Season 1 and sees the Pass divided into several pages. Each Page has several rewards, with each Page having at least 1 Free Tier reward, which will unlock even if you haven’t purchased any version of the premium Battle Pass. The Battle Pass starts with a single Page available, with each subsequent Page being unlocked after a certain number of items are claimed. Players will be able to use Battle Pass Tokens to unlock each item. If the Auto Unlock feature is enabled, items will be unlocked each time a Token is acquired in chronological order, similar to a class Battle Pass. If this feature is off, players can unlock items in any order as long as the Page is unlocked. One thing that does remain from the Sector’s system is the HVT reward. This high-tier item can be unlocked when players complete an entire Page and then use a Token.\nThe Black Ops 6 Season 3 Battle Pass also has a BlackCell version. This premium version of the Battle Pass must be bought with real money and not CoD Points. It gives those willing to buy a collection of exclusive rewards and everything else that comes with the regular Battle Pass. Upon buying the Battle Pass, players will get 1,100 CoD Points, 20 Tier Skips, an exclusive Operator, Finishing Move, and even a Clan Tag. With the BlackCell, there will also be unique Skins for every HVT Operator Skin and Weapon Blueprint. The BlackCell also comes with a single BlackCell Instant Page Unlock Token, which allows players to pick one locked Page and gain access to it without having to reach its requirements.\nBelow is the full list of every item available in the Season 3 Battle Pass for Black Ops 6 and Warzone broken down by Page:\nBlackCell Page: Unlocked instantly if BlackCell is purchased 10% XP Boost 1,100 CoD Points Emote: Martial Arts XM4 Weapon Blueprint: Energy Siphon Finishing Move: Goodest Boy BlackCell Clan Tag HVT- Operator: R0-Z3 Page 0 (Earned for Purchasing the Battle Pass): Battle Pass XP Bonus: 10% Boost to Battle Pass Progression Weapon Sticker: Day Ones Finishing Move: Package Received Saug Weapon Blueprint: Marbled HVT- Operator: Mace ( Mace BlackCell ) Page 1 (Instantly Unlocked): Spray: Tank Fire (Free Tier) Marine SP Weapon Blueprint: Trench Wrecker Emote: Juggler 1 Hour Double XP Token Hand Cannon Skin: Heavy Issue and Calling Card: Burning Obstacles Emblem: Jungle Warfare HVT- Feng 82 Weapon Blueprint: Conflict Victor ( Conflict Victor BlackCell ) Page 2 (Requires 3 items to be claimed): 100 CoD Points (Free Tier) Weapon Charm: Tagged Up Nuchaku Weapon Blueprint: Rebarchuck TR2 Weapon Blueprint: Old Timer 30-Minute Double Weapon XP Token Optic Reticle: Oval Cap and Gobblegum: 3x Free Fire HVT- Operator : Hudson( Hudson BlackCell ) Page 3 (Requires 7 items to be claimed): Ames 85 Weapon Blueprint: Most Wanted MVP Emblem: Hatchling Calling Card: Chopper Popper Weapon Sticker: Crowned 30-Minute Double XP Token (Free Tier) Spray: Woods Stance HVT- New Weapon: HDR Sniper Rifle Page 4 (Requires 11 items to be claimed): 1 Hour Double Weapon XP Token Combat Axe Skin: Severed Steel 100 CoD Points Cypher 091 Weapon Blueprint: Bandaged Weapon Charm: Quad Support (Free Tier) Calling Card: Engage Hostiles!
