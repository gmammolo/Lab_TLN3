  "text": "This article contains spoilers from One Piece's Egghead arc.\nSummary\n- One Piece's massive success ensures future spin-offs are likely due to its legendary status in Japan.\n- Oda plans to draw a spinoff manga focusing on the character of Garp to delve into his relationships.\n- Even after the main story ends, Oda will continue to expand on the One Piece world with new characters and stories.\nEiichiro Oda, the creator of One Piece, has built a world so massive that he's never too short of amazing ideas to drive the story forward. Oda has maintained quality writing consistently for about three decades, but now, slowly, the series is coming to a close.\nRelated\nOne Piece: The D Clan Traitor In The Void Century, Explained\nThe Void Century is still full of mysteries. A traitor in the D clan led to its downfall.\nOne Piece has now entered the Final Saga and in a few years, the story is most definitely going to come to an end. Once it does end, fans won't have much to look forward to, but Oda definitely has plans of his own that will keep them excited.\nWhy One Piece Will Continue With Spin-offs\n- One Piece Is A Massive IP\n- Oda Plans Some Big Spinoffs\nOne Piece being in its final saga only means that the story is inevitably going to come to an end sooner rather than later. Of course, the final saga is not going to be short at all and fans still have years worth of content ahead of them, especially since Oda is now taking more breaks than ever before. However, that still doesn't change the fact that the series ends in a few years. Once Oda does wrap up One Piece, he will most likely want to relax and spend some time with his family after spending the majority of his life working on the serialization of the story. However, eventually, Oda will drop side stories every now and then. This is most certainly going to be the case for two reasons.\nI will end One Piece when I want to. — Oda\nThe first reason is that One Piece is Japan's biggest manga series in history. This story is legendary in every respect and fans know how Shueisha treats its big series. Dragon Ball ended decades ago but it is still continuing to this day. Naruto ended a decade ago and it still has side stories and whatnot. One Piece is far bigger as far as Japan is concerned and there's absolutely no way its mammoth status isn't going to be capitalized upon. One Piece cannot die, no matter what.\nOf course, this doesn't mean there will be pointless One Piece content and that Oda won't be involved in the things. In fact, Oda himself will be drawing side stories in the future, as he's confirmed before.\nOda's Plans For A Garp Story\nOda Has Many Characters He Wants To Elaborate Upon\nOne Piece's main story might end, but the world is ever-expanding and it'll never truly end. Fans will most definitely see Oda drop side stories himself and he's said so in the past as well.\nAbout spin-offs, I came up with a magnificent story about Garp. I'd like to draw his relationship with Akainu, Aokiji, Smoker, Hina, Coby, Cipher Pol, and Roger. — Eiichiro Oda\nClearly, Oda wants to draw side stories and in his mind, Garp would make an excellent protagonist of this story. Oda loves Garp and his complex character would be the best to drive this side story forward in his opinion.\nRelated\nOne Piece: Why Luffy Is Actually An Alien, Explained\nLuffy could be an alien. He has a deep connection to the moon in One Piece.\nOda would expand upon the character of Garp in many ways. Despite being a Marine, Garp doesn't adhere to the Celestial Dragons and considers them to be the scum of the world. He follows his own brand of justice and delivers it in his own way. Garp is very special not just to Oda but also to the fans. His complex relationships with many characters of the world make him unique, and just as Oda mentioned, this side story would give fans a good look at how he shaped his connections with the likes of Kuzan and Sakazuki, two of the leading figures within the Navy, and the up-and-coming generation, which includes the likes of Smoker and Hina.\nGarp And The Roger's Relationships Explored\nCuriously enough, Oda also wants to explore Garp's relationship with the Cipher Pol, which is an organization that works directly for the Celestial Dragons. Clearly, he wouldn't have a high impression of this organization. Most of all, Oda would highlight Garp's relationship with Roger, which is something that fans are dying to see.\nThese elements alone would make the story worth investing in and it just goes to show that even when One Piece ends, Oda can take new approaches through different characters and add further depth to the world of One Piece.\nOne Piece chapter 1145 will be out very soon, later this week. As usual, One Piece is going to drop on the upcoming Sunday. In Japan, One Piece drops at 12AM JST on Monday. However, the vast majority of international readers will see the chapter available on April 6. The official release date of One Piece Chapter 1145 is April 6, 2025. Fans can read the chapter for free on Manga Plus.\nOne Piece\n- Release Date\n- October 20, 1999\n- Network\n- Fuji TV\n- Directors\n- Hiroaki Miyamoto, Konosuke Uda, Junji Shimizu, Satoshi Itō, Munehisa Sakai, Katsumi Tokoro, Yutaka Nakajima, Yoshihiro Ueda, Kenichi Takeshita, Yoko Ikeda, Ryota Nakamura, Hiroyuki Kakudou, Takahiro Imamura, Toshihiro Maeya, Yûji Endô, Nozomu Shishido, Hidehiko Kadota, Sumio Watanabe, Harume Kosaka, Yasuhiro Tanabe, Yukihiko Nakao, Keisuke Onishi, Junichi Fujise, Hiroyuki Satou\n- Writers\n- Jin Tanaka, Akiko Inoue, Junki Takegami, Shinzo Fujita, Shouji Yonemura, Yoshiyuki Suga, Atsuhiro Tomioka, Hirohiko Uesaka, Michiru Shimada, Isao Murayama, Takuya Masumoto, Yoichi Takahashi, Momoka Toyoda\n- Franchise(s)\n-\nOne Piece\nCast\n-\nMayumi TanakaMonkey D.
