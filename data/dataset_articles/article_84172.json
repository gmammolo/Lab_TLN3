  "text": "Director General Daniel Alvarez, left, and John Kutsch. (Photo: TEA)\nRepresentatives of El Salvador’s government and the Thorium Energy Alliance have signed a memorandum of understanding to promote El Salvador’s plan for renewable energy through thorium.\nThe document was signed on March 14 by Daniel Alvarez, director general of energy, hydrocarbons, and mines, and John Kutsch, executive director of the Thorium Energy Alliance, at the El Salvador embassy in Washington, D.C. The signing was witnessed by Milena Mayorga, El Salvador’s ambassador to the United States.\nThe purpose of the agreement is to formally establish the framework for cooperation between the Thorium Energy Alliance and El Salvador to develop a strategic plan to deploy thorium-powered reactors and thermal energy storage systems. Thorium is a naturally occurring element that can be used as fuel to generate electricity in advanced nuclear reactors.\nThey said it: “I am pleased to announce the launch of this innovative project that will revolutionize the energy landscape of El Salvador,” said Alvarez.\nKutsch added, “The leadership of El Salvador is rising and taking the bold steps necessary to ensure access to abundant and reliable energy, with the goal of ensuring a future of prosperity or all.\"\nMayorga noted, “Through this effort, we are fulfilling President Nayib Bukele's mandate to consolidate the diversification strategy of our energy matrix to improve the economy and well-being of our citizens.\"\nEl Salvador’s energy: Currently, the bulk of the country’s electric power comes from fossil fuels, but gains are being made by hydropower, biomass, solar, and geothermal energy.\nEl Salvador uses about 6 million MWh of electric energy per year, according to WorldDate.info .\nAbout the Alliance: The Thorium Energy Alliance is an education-focused organization composed of scientists and engineers who are committed to reducing the cost of energy, increasing the availability of critical materials, and protecting the environment.",
