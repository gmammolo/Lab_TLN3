  "text": "US 7,800-ton nuclear submarine bolsters attack with more torpedo tubes, advanced tech\nThe vessel can go to a maximum depth of 800+ ft and offers a speed of 25+ knots (28+ miles per hour).\nThe United States is set to commission its fast-attack nuclear-powered submarine built using the latest technology on April 5. The USS Iowa will be commissioned by the US Navy in Groton, Connecticut.\nThe Virginia-class submarine took six years in the making. It was named after the state of Iowa in June 2023 by former Iowa first-lady Christie Vilsack, the ship’s sponsor.\nThe USS Iowa, which has a displacement of 7,800 tons of water, will be the first fast-attack submarine specifically designed and built to provide the privacy and accommodations females require.\nQuiet movement, sensitive sonar\nThe SSN 797 submarine offers quiet movement, and it’s equipped with sensitive sonar to track other subs and warships.\nThe vessel has four torpedo tubes and two Virginia Payload Tubes (VPT), each capable of holding six vertical-launch Tomahawk missiles that can strike targets over 1,200 miles away.\nThe vessel has photonics masts carrying thermal imaging and low-light cameras; replacing the telescope. It’s equipped with a nuclear reactor, which powers the submarine for a 30+ year lifespan. Its pump jet propulsion allows the vessel to move more quietly.\nWith a length of 377 ft, the vessel can go to a maximum depth of 800+ ft and offers a speed of 25+ knots (28+ miles per hour).\n“The USS Iowa Commissioning Committee raised money for the last five or six years for this week’s events and to provide upgrades to the boat that aren’t a part of the building process,” said Tom Hudson, a U.S. Navy Veteran and an executive director of the USS Iowa Commissioning Committee.\n“For example: where the crew eats and where they watch movies and things like that. We’re getting them ice cream machines. We’re getting them movie projectors. We’re getting them gaming stations. So when they’re out to sea, and they’re gone for 90, 100, 200 days at a time, they can have increased and improved quality of life.”\nSeveral ships named for Iowa in US history\nThe USS Iowa submarine is the latest of several ships named for Iowa in the nation’s history.\nAn Iowa steamship was used to transport troops in the Civil War. The battleship USS Iowa BB-4 saw service in the Spanish-American War of 1898 and the USS Iowa BB-61, “The Gray Ghost,” served in World War II, Korea and in the 1980s through 1990 patrolling the Persian Gulf. The state of Iowa paid $3 million toward the BB-61’s preservation before it was opened for public tours in 2012. Visiting Iowans may tour “The Gray Ghost” for free by simply displaying an Iowa driver license or state identification.\nRECOMMENDED ARTICLES\nThe official crest of the new USS Iowa submarine (SSN-797) is designed to visually represent the ship throughout its lifecycle. It’s a key element to Iowa’s identity. Filled with symbolism representing the state of Iowa as well as the storied battleship BB61, SSN797’s crest is worth learning about.\nThe Shield features the Iowa state seal in the background bordered by teak decking, symbolizing the teak deck boards aboard USS Iowa (BB-61) with the text “USS IOWA” above and “SSN 797” below, which is encircled by gold cord with 47 silver stars. These silver stars represent the 47 sailors who tragically lost their lives during the Number Two 16-inch gun turret explosion on April 19, 1989. On top of this is the profile of the state of Iowa adorned with the colors of the Iowa state flag.\nABOUT THE EDITOR\nPrabhat Ranjan Mishra Prabhat, an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication, is a tech and defense journalist.
