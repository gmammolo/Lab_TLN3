  "text": "Editor's Note: The following contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 6 of Surface.\nFrom the start of Surface Season 2, Tess (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) — now, once again, going by Sophie — has been on a relentless quest to uncover her past, returning to London to investigate the truth about her mother’s death while infiltrating the powerful Huntley family. As Sophie pieces together the mystery, she comes to a startling realization: the Huntleys’ secrets run deep, and she has been one of them all along.\nIn Episode 6, \"Atonement,\" Sophie finally confronts Henry Huntley (Rupert Graves), the man she has uncovered as her biological father. After carefully working her way into the Huntley family by getting closer to Eliza (Millie Brady) and Quinn (Phil Dunster), the facade shatters when the truth is exposed. This pivotal moment drives the story forward with shocking revelations while showcasing standout performances, marking a turning point in Sophie’s quest for the truth and leaving both her and the audience questioning what comes next.\nSophie Finally Confronts Henry in Season 2, Episode 6 of 'Surface'\nUncertain of who she can trust, Sophie reaches out to James (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) and shares the shocking revelation — her real name is Sophie Huntley. She now knows the Huntleys tried to erase her, giving her the name Tess and sending her away after her mother's death. Feeling vulnerable, she struggles to understand why she would have hurt James the way she did. Despite everything, James obviously still loves her and always gravitates toward caring for her — something Jackson-Cohen portrays with effortless sincerity. Though his motives aren’t entirely pure, given that he’s still trying to recover his money, the moment between them is sweet.\nWhen Sophie finally reaches out to Henry, he agrees to meet with her privately, giving her hope that she may finally get answers. But Henry doesn’t make it easy. Instead of showing up, he sends his lawyer, Richard (John Macmillan), who presents her with a contract and a substantial payout to ensure her silence. This calculated move makes it clear that Henry — or the powerful family he belongs to — will go to great lengths to keep certain truths buried. Frustrated and unwilling to be cast aside, Sophie refuses to take the offer and seeks comfort in James. While she has been manipulative in the past, this moment of intimacy between them feels raw and genuine. James acknowledges how confusing it is, but at that moment, it’s something they both seem to need.\nRelated\nBefore 'Surface,' Gugu Mbatha-Raw Put Her Own Spin on 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' in This J.J. Abrams Spy Series\nThis high-concept (but not science fiction) show was canceled far too soon.\nDetermined to confront Henry directly, Sophie crashes a Huntley family party, catching him off guard. She makes it clear she isn’t interested in his money. All she wants is to know the truth about what happened to her mother. Surprisingly, Henry doesn’t resist her questions. Instead, he seems almost relieved as he finally tells her what happened, insisting that her mother’s death was a tragic accident. He describes her as unusually paranoid that night, recalling how she came to him in distress before speeding away in the rain, losing control around a hairpin turn, and crashing her car. The vehicle caught fire, and he insists he couldn’t reach her in time.\nHenry then apologizes for not stepping in to help Sophie after her mother’s death, admitting that fear and his father’s advice kept him silent. Rupert Graves delivers a compelling performance, portraying Henry with an unexpected softness that adds complexity to a character we've come to know as ruthless and, potentially, a murderer. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is equally powerful, capturing Sophie’s raw emotions. She's clearly moved by his words but is still left with uncertainty. She has a brief flashback of sitting in the back seat of a car on a rainy night, a memory that could challenge Henry’s version of events. Is Henry finally telling the truth, or is he manipulating her to make her stop digging? Either way, what she does next will have major ramifications moving forward.\nWhat This New Development Means for the Rest of 'Surface' Season 2\nDespite her vulnerable moment with Henry, Sophie doesn’t leave the meeting empty-handed. She secretly records the conversation but, instead of going public herself, she hands the tape over to Callum (Gavin Drea). She tells him he can use it for his article on the Huntleys, but insists on remaining anonymous, not wanting to be defined by this drama. While it’s unclear how Callum will ultimately use the tape by the end of the episode, it’s evident that its release will have significant consequences for Sophie.\nThe final moments of the episode also offer a different layer to the mystery. Earlier at the party, Eliza shares a moment with her mother, Olivia (Joely Richardson), who tries to comfort her by claiming that Henry did right by Sophie and her mother, offering money and a car. But when Eliza notices a photo of her father with a car she recognizes — the same one she saw abandoned with Sophie in the woods — the truth becomes murkier. The car doesn’t appear to have been in an accident or caught fire, raising the question: Is Henry telling the truth? And if he is, why was Sophie's mother so paranoid, and is it linked to a larger conspiracy involving the Huntleys?\nWith only a few episodes left, Sophie’s quest for answers intensifies. The realization that James has broken into her safe and taken everything leaves her feeling more alone than ever. He's also taken hostage in the final moments of the episode, likely by someone connected to the Huntleys, which hints at much more dangerous things ahead. Episode 6 shifts Surface into new territory, offering answers that lead to more questions. With the Huntley family’s secrets unraveling and James’ life in jeopardy, the rest of the season promises to be a thrilling and unpredictable ride for Sophie.\nNew episodes of Surface drop every Friday on AppleTV+.\nSurface\n- Release Date\n- July 28, 2022\n- Network\n- Apple TV+\n- Directors\n- Kevin Rodney Sullivan, Jennifer Morrison\n- Writers\n- Leigh Ann Biety, Erica L.
