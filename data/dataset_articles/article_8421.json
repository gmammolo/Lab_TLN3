  "text": "Heroic loco pilots save thousands after train engine breaks down on Samastipur bridge Two loco pilots heroically saved thousands of passengers by repairing a sudden air pressure leak under a train engine on a bridge in Samastipur, Bihar. Samastipur: A video going viral on social media shows two loco pilots saving the lives of thousands of passengers after the train engine broke down in the middle of a bridge. Reportedly, there was sudden air pressure leakage from the unloader valve of the loco engine on bridge number 382 built between Balmikinagar and Paniyawa stations of Samastipur Railway Division. This resulted in the train’s halt in the middle of the bridge. The train’s loco pilot and assistant loco pilot risked their lives and crawled under the train on the bridge to repair the leakage in the engine. They then took the train safely to the next station. DRM Vinay Srivastava of Samastipur Railway Division has announced a reward of Rs 10,000 to both the loco pilots, Zee News reported. Credits: X",
