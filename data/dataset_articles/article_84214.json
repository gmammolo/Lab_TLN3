  "text": "This development marks a significant expansion of Metrea’s presence in the international aerial refuelling market. It follows the company’s July acquisition of 14 tanker aircraft—C-135FR and KC-135RG models—from the French Air and Space Force, bringing Metrea’s fleet to 18 aircraft.\nWith this fleet, Metrea now operates the largest commercial aerial refuelling service in the world, exceeding the capabilities of all but four national air forces. The company remains the only commercial provider to own and operate a fleet of C-/KC-135 aircraft, integrating seamlessly into military aviation training and operations.\nMetrea’s tankers are equipped with wing-mounted Multi-Point Refuelling System (MPRS) pods, enabling them to support probe-equipped aircraft from naval, marine, and allied forces. The contract with India builds on Metrea’s existing partnership with the US Navy and other allied air forces.\n“Metrea is honoured to be working with the Indian Air Force,” said James “Slim” Morgan, Head of Metrea Strategic Mobility. “Our contract will quickly expand their AAR training capability and will facilitate extensive training, exercise, and movement opportunities to improve IAF readiness.”",
