  "text": "This delivery makes Norway the first F-35 partner nation to complete its full fleet of the aircraft, bringing the Royal Norwegian Air Force’s (RNAF) operational F-35 fleet to a total of 52 aircraft.\n“The F-35 is a powerful tool for strategic deterrence, enhancing alliance-based security and discouraging potential aggression,” said RNAF Col Egil Soerstroenen, the F-35 JPO Norway National Deputy. “Receiving all our 52 F-35 aircraft thus represents a huge milestone for Norway. We highly value the solid and successful partnership with government and industry in the F-35 program, and we will continue to evolve Norway’s F-35 capability in strong cooperation with the other F-35 partner nations.”\nThe advanced 5th-generation capabilities of the F-35 platform and now with a full fleet of F-35 aircraft, Norway will be able to enhance its military capabilities to secure its sovereignty and protect its interests in the High North, as well as support NATO in critical missions.\n“The F-35 is a fundamental capability for Norway and the Norwegian Armed Forces,” said Soerstroenen. “The cooperative nature of the F-35 program expands on our partnership with key allies enabling us to support the important mission of maintaining control of our area on NATO’s Northern flank. The F-35’s ability to operate nearly autonomous in a contested environment makes it a truly remarkable weapon platform.”\nThis milestone reflects F-35 program’s strength of international cooperation. As the first partner nation to complete its full fleet, Norway sets a precedent for operational readiness and long-term commitment to collective defense.\nThe F-35 is the multi-mission strike fighter of choice for 20 allied nations and routinely demonstrates its unmatched capabilities at the hands of joint and international warfighters. The continued success of the global F-35 enterprise – through shared investment, innovation, and interoperability – demonstrates how allied nations are uniting to ensure security, stability, and peace in an increasingly complex global environment.",
