  "text": "So, I picked this game March 15 and ended up playing every day until today.\nFinally finished with almost 80 hours played, beating all type of bosses, mobs and kings.\nAmount of high quality content is extremely impressive, specially if we take I. Consideration the game wasn't even sold at the traditional full price for the nowdays AAA standards.\nThis game is just absolutely incredible and extremely impressive tech wise.\nMy final impressions for me howlongtobeat review:\nAbsolutely incredible game.\nReally hard to believe this is the first AAA game from this developers when we are seeing so many major AAA studios with millions of dollars releasing average games.\nStory is a bit hard to follow for people like me not familiarize with the Journey to the west tale but even so, is very very entertaining to follow the characters because they are very well portrayed here.\nCutscenes are awesome, voice acting, the art in some scenes and overall cinematography is very impressive and enjoyable to see.\nGameplay is very good, with great combat, lots of techniques to unlock and master, awesome secrets to find, awesome places to explore and absolutely incredible and memorable boss fights.\nThe amount of high quality content here is extremely impressive and the game was sold at 60 dollars.\nBosses move sets, overall animations and presentation are so good and epic.\nSome of the best boss fighting ever in vídeo games.\nVisuals are not perfect and there's some very bad pop in in textures, vegetation and lighting, kind of typical of unreal engine games. some textures also are not at the same level as others.\nOk. Apart from this, visuals are extraordinary. Some environments are absolutely incredible and overall characters are also incredibly detailed and well realized with some impressive models and incredible work on materials and fabrics. The main start of the show is the animation work that is extremely impressive, specially for a new studio.\nA subject (animations) where even veterans of the industry fail, game science really made an incredible job with many contextual and some beautifully choreographed animations.\nSoundtrack is also fantastic and some tracks are truly spectacular.\nPresentation of the game is almost sublime with some nitpicks like the mentioned pop in and some loading screens, but overall is absolutely incredible with some awesome camera work, impressive visuals and music and some absolutely incredible scenes and art.\nI really loved this game and got extremely impressed but the overall quality of the game, even on console (Played on PS5Pro), delivered by Game science.\nFinally finished with almost 80 hours played, beating all type of bosses, mobs and kings.\nAmount of high quality content is extremely impressive, specially if we take I.
