  "text": "Protecting Australia's rich natural assets from pests and diseases is a shared responsibility for all Australians.\nAustralia's inaugural National Biosecurity Strategy (NBS) Action Plan guides the vital work of strengthening our national biosecurity by outlining activities and priorities for governments and industries. It was endorsed by Agricultural Ministers in late 2024 and launched on 23 December 2024.\nThe NBS Action Plan was developed in collaboration with stakeholders across the nation's biosecurity system. It supports our goal to protect Australia's environment, economy and way of life from the biosecurity threats of today and tomorrow.\nThe six priority areas of the NBS Action Plan are:\n- Shared biosecurity culture\n- Stronger partnerships\n- Highly skilled workforce\n- Coordinated preparedness and response\n- Sustainable investment\n- Integration supported by technology, research and data.\nThere will be ongoing opportunities to engage and contribute to the delivery of the NBS Action Plan activities as it moves into the delivery phase.\nDownload the NBS Action Plan today.\nhere.",
