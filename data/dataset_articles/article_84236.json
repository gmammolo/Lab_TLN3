  "text": "Withings has officially launched BPM Vision in the United States, expanding its portfolio of connected health devices with a focus on making blood pressure monitoring easier, clearer, and more accurate for everyday users. The FDA-cleared device, initially revealed earlier this year at CES, is now available for $149.95 on withings.com , with broader retail availability via Amazon and select partners beginning May 2025.\nA High-Tech Helper for Hypertension The BPM Vision is a smart blood pressure monitor designed to address some of the most common user pain points—confusing interfaces, inconsistent readings, and uncomfortable cuffs. With a sharp 2.8-inch color display and step-by-step on-screen tutorials, the device walks users through the proper positioning and measurement technique without requiring a manual or a Ph.D. in cardiology.\nAt the heart of its accuracy is TripleTrust, Withings ’ approach to clinical-grade reliability. The device takes three consecutive readings—just like many doctors do in the clinic—to minimize outliers and improve measurement confidence.\nThe BPM Vision provides clear systolic and diastolic blood pressure data, along with heart rate tracking. Results are displayed in an easy-to-read format with color-coded feedback, making it immediately obvious whether the numbers fall in the green zone or need attention.\nDesigned for Real-Life Use Withings has paid attention to more than just numbers. The BPM Vision is designed with interchangeable cuffs that fit arms ranging from 9 to 20 inches (22 to 52 cm), ensuring comfort and accessibility for a wide range of adults. It’s also built for the realities of family life, supporting health data for up to eight users—each with individual profiles in the Withings app.\nThanks to AutoSync+, the device connects via Wi-Fi to automatically upload readings without the need for a smartphone nearby. This means users can take a reading in the morning without fumbling for their phone and still have it logged and ready in the app when they need it.\nMore Than Just a Monitor Monitoring blood pressure at home has never been more important, especially given that hypertension affects nearly half of adults in the U.S. But it’s not just about tracking numbers—it’s about turning that data into action. By syncing with the Withings app, BPM Vision enables users to generate detailed health reports that can be shared with healthcare providers. The result is better conversations and more informed treatment decisions.\nAlso Available in EU, BeamO Withings BeamO is a compact 4-in-1 health device that combines a digital stethoscope, thermometer, oximeter, and 1-lead ECG to deliver fast, clinical-grade checkups at home or on the go. Following CE approval, it’s being positioned as a “thermometer of the future” and includes a 3-month Withings+ subscription with advanced cardiac insights. U.S. and U.K. availability is expected later in 2025, pending regulatory clearance.
