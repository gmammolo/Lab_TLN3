  "text": "Albion Online Finally Makes The Leap To The Epic Games Store\nIt only took eight years.\nToday, Sandbox Interactive announced that its F2P sandbox MMORPG Albion Online would be joining the Epic Games Store library. The game will officially launch on the platform on April 16, hopefully encouraging new players to try the game out.\nCurrently, the game is listed on the store and players can add it to their wishlist. Note that to play Albion Online on the Epic Games Store, you will need to create a new account and link it to your Epic Games account. This means that those with existing accounts on other platforms can not connect their game to Epic, not that we’re entirely sure why you’d want to hop to another platform at this point anyway if you're already playing.\nhere!\nAlbion Online,\nSandbox Interactive.\nAbout the Author\nQuintLyn is a long-time lover of all things video game related will happily talk about them to anyone that will listen. She began writing about games for various gaming sites a little over ten years ago and has taken on various roles in the games community.\nMore Stories by QuintLyn Bowers\nRead Next\nIt Still Hasn't Been Officially \"Revived,\" But Heroes Of The Storm Has Released On Game Pass With 30 Free Heroes\nIt's not on Steam or on consoles yet, but maybe this is a start?\nYou May Enjoy\nThere's actually 3 events awarding Starbloom Coins.\nThe test will include new content, daily login rewards, and more.\nIt’s Time To Add Iansan To Your Lineup With The Launch Of Genshin Impact’s “Day Of The Flame’s Return” Update\nThe update finally unlocks reputation for The Collective of Plenty.\nThe update also adjusts loot tables for guild raid and Riftstone bosses.",
