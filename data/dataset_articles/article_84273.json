  "text": "The UFC’s new tech partnership with Meta, announced by both sides Wednesday morning, will encompass a range of activations across Meta’s product portfolio.\nWhile specifics are in some cases to-be-determined as they embark on the early stages of their multiyear agreement, integrations with everything from Meta’s AI glasses to social media platforms (mainly, Threads) are on the roadmap, TKO EVP & Head of Partnerships Grant Norris-Jones told SBJ.\n“It’s a full-platform collaboration,” Norris-Jones said. “We were in the market, talking to all types of different partners in all these different (tech) categories ... as we started an RFP process, Meta kept coming up as best-in-class across the board.”\nThe deal designates Meta UFC’s first “official fan technology partner.” It also includes designations for Meta Glasses (AI glasses partner), Threads (social media partner) and Meta AI (fan AI partner).\nMeta’s augmented reality Ray-Ban glasses, Norris-Jones said, will be used by UFC athletes and talent to capture unique angles of moments such as fighter walk-outs or weigh-ins. Fans may also eventually use them as a viewing enhancement.\nExclusive content from Threads, meanwhile, will be piped into UFC’s broadcasts as part of its slice of the overall partnership, Norris-Jones added. UFC is also eyeing ways to leverage WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook to engage with both domestic and international fans (UFC says 90% of its 700 million-person fanbase is from outside North America).\nMeta AI, the artificial intelligence suite that includes virtual assistants and image generation technology, will be available to fans as a tool for planning “fight week itineraries,” to start. Its use-cases could expand to enhancing kit designs or even the development of a new fighter ranking system, the latter of which UFC CEO Dana White alluded to in an Instagram post Wednesday. (Norris-Jones drew a key distinction between Meta AI as a B2C-focused partnership and IBM, UFC’s B2B enterprise AI partner as of November; at the center of the latter deal is a “UFC Insights Engine” of AI-powered metrics built with IBM’s watsonx back-office AI suite.)\nAlso included in the Meta deal is octagon branding for the tech giant, and further collaboration (including product demoes at events) with Meta Quest, which UFC has previously worked with on branded experiences in its Horizon Worlds VR platform.\n“There’s a lot we’re working on together,” Norris-Jones said. “There’s going to be a lot of exciting developments to come.”",
