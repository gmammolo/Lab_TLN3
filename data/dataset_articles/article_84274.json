Read our privacy policy Newly-identified dinosaur footprints on the Isle of Skye reveal herbivores and carnivores coexisted at freshwater lagoons some 167 million years ago.\nA University of Edinburgh team analysed 131 footprints at Prince Charles’s Point, on the island’s Trotternish Peninsula, uncovering evidence of a diverse ecosystem.\nAmong the tracks were rare prints of megalosaurs – a jeep-sized theropod and cousin and ancestor of the T.Rex – alongside those of plant-eating sauropods - long-necked herbivores possibly two or three times the size of an elephant, identifiable by their large, circular footprints.\nThe footprints were once considered by geologists to have been resting burrows of fish.\nThe researchers said the site provides a “fascinating insight” into the environmental preferences and behaviours of dinosaurs from the Middle Jurassic period.\nopen image in gallery A pair of theropod footprints, as seen on site a Prince Charles's Point on the Isle of Skye in 2021 (Paige E. de Polo/University of Edinburgh/PA Wire) Analysis of the multi-directional tracks and walking gaits, they explained, suggest the prehistoric beasts milled around the lagoon’s margins, similar to how animals congregate around watering holes today.\nThey added that the tracks show that regardless of dominance, the meat-eating therapods and plant-eating sauropods habitually spent time in lagoons, as opposed to exposed, drier mudflats.\nResearch lead Tone Blakesley said: “The footprints at Prince Charles’s Point provide a fascinating insight into the behaviours and environmental distributions of meat-eating theropods and plant-eating, long-necked sauropods during an important time in their evolution.\n“On Skye, these dinosaurs clearly preferred shallowly submerged lagoon environments over subaerially exposed mudflats.”\nopen image in gallery An artist rendition of meat eating megalosaurs and plant eating sauropods mingling at a site on Prince Charles's Point on the Isle of Skye (Tone Blakesley/Scott Reid/University of Edinburgh/PA Wire) The first three footprints at the site were discovered five years ago by a University of Edinburgh student and colleagues during a visit to the shoreline.\nSubsequent discoveries of other footprints in the area made it one of the most extensive dinosaur track sites in Scotland, with scientists saying they expect to find more.\nThe research team studied the tracks by taking thousands of overlapping photographs of the entire site with a drone, before using specialist software software to construct 3D models of the footprints via a technique called photogrammetry.\nSteve Brusatte, personal chair of palaeontology and evolution at the University of Edinburgh, reflected on the fact the remote bay on the Trotternish Peninsula was also where Bonnie Prince Charlie hid in 1746 while on the run from British troops.\n“Prince Charles’s Point is a place where Scottish history and prehistory blend together,” he said.\n“It’s astounding to think that when Bonnie Prince Charlie was running for his life, he might have been sprinting in the footsteps of dinosaurs.”\nThe research, published in PLOS One, was funded by the Leverhulme Trust and National Geographic Society.\nMore about University Of Edinburgh Isle of Skye palaeontology Dinosaurs Join our commenting forum Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments\nMost Popular Popular videos Sponsored Features",
