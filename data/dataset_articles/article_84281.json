  "text": "News and resources on digital currencies, crypto assets and crypto exchanges worldwide.\nThis content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community.\nRipple has integrated its recently-launched stablecoin into its flagship cross-border payments system.\nLaunched in December, the enterprise-grade, USD-denominated RLUSD stablecoin is already nearing $250 million in market capitalisation and $10 billion in trading. “We're seeing the market cap continue to grow, outpacing our internal projections. In short order, RLUSD is being used for a number of use cases, including use as collateral in both crypto and tradfi trading markets,\" says Jack McDonald, SVP, stablecoins, Ripple. Now, the company has enabled RLUSD cross-border payments in Ripple Payments. Ripple claims that, unlike many stablecoins, which are designed for retail use, RLUSD has built-in global enterprise utility to improve the speed and efficiency of cross-border payments. The stablecoin is already being used in the payment flow with select customers, including cross-border payment providers BKK Forex and iSend to improve their treasury operations.\nWelcome to Finextra.
