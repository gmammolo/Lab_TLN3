Upgrade prices haven't yet been revealed, but Nintendo has confirmed - via a post-Direct trailer - the Zelda upgrades will be free to anyone with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership.\nStarting with Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, these'll both get enhanced resolution and improved frame rates on Switch 2,…\nMatt Wales",
