  "text": "Astronics Corporation launched the SkyShow Server, an advanced moving map system developed by Astronics CSC in collaboration with FlightPath3D. Designed for seamless integration into both new and existing aircraft cabins, SkyShow Server delivers stunning 4K-resolution visuals, enhancing the in-flight experience. Developed with FlightPath3D's premier software, the SkyShow Server is an ideal solution for airlines seeking to modernize outdated moving map systems. It provides a high-performance, interactive experience, allowing passengers to explore real-time flight data and immersive visuals directly from their personal devices.\nThis next-generation technology transforms in-flight entertainment, creating a more dynamic and engaging journey. The system is highly configurable to meet cohesive branding and experience objectives, allowing personalization of colors, icons, and layouts, with over 50,000 Points of Interest (POI) pins for destination exploration. It features touch controls, augmented reality views, and real-time flight data, offering modes like tracking the flight's journey, 360deg aircraft views, cockpit perspectives, and a \"flying-over-places\" feature for an immersive passenger experience.\nIntegration of the SkyShow Server is seamless, featuring a comprehensive set of essential interfaces, including 3G HD SDI and 4K HDMI outputs, RS232 controller interface, RS232 and ARINC 429 flight data ports, multiple discrete inputs/outputs, digital/analog audio outputs, and an Ethernet aircraft interface. This innovative solution sets a new industry benchmark for seamless in-cabin integration and customer experiences. The SkyShow Server is expected to be fully certified and available by third quarter 2025, with orders now being accepted.\nShare © S&P Capital IQ - 2025",
