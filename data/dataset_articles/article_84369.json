  "text": "( KSWB ) — New releases on Netflix are on schedule to bloom throughout the month of April, with the platform offering fresh content to kick off the spring season. When it comes to series, thrill-seekers will be pleased to know that season five of “ You ” is on its way. The stakes will be higher than ever for the main character, Joe Goldberg, who will return to the infamous bookstore in New York City where his story first began. According to Netflix, “You” will be available for streaming on April 24. Another series, “ Love on the Spectrum ,” is also set to return for its third season. This reality show, which is perfect for the quirky romantics out there, will once again delve into the world of dating while on the autism spectrum. Its release, slated for April 2, falls amid Autism Acceptance Month, which celebrates the experiences and identities of autistic individuals. For those into documentary-style streams, there are some options for you too. On April 9, Netflix will release “ Bad Influence: The Dark Side of Kidfluencing ,” which exposes what has been described as the “disturbing accounts of abuse and exploitation” in the world of child influencers. Another documentary, “ Minted: The Rise (And Fall?) of the NFT ,” will be released that same day. It looks at the recent fad of NFT art. Last but not least, let’s talk movies. Tom Hardy fans will be pleased to know his action-thriller “ HAVOC ” is hitting the streaming platform on April 25. The movie depicts a drug deal gone wrong and a city’s corrupt criminal underworld. If that’s not your cup of tea, perhaps try the comedy/drama “ How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies ,” out on April 12, about a college dropout caring for his ailing grandmother. If none of these titles spark your interest, check out the full list of April 2025 Netflix releases (found below). Which new release are you most excited for?
