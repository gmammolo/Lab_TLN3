  "text": "In a signifigant broadcast journalism milestone, Sinclair has become the first media company to receive Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval to operate drones over people and moving vehicles without requiring special waivers for news gathering purposes.\nThe authorization, which stems from the FAA’s acceptance of Sinclair’s Declaration of Compliance for Operations Over People, represents a major advancement in drone journalism capabilities. This approval allows Sinclair to use specially modified drones while following strict safety protocols that meet federal requirements.\n“This approval represents a significant step forward in our ability to deliver high-quality, innovative journalism,” said Scott Livingston, Senior Vice President of News for Sinclair in the news release . “By incorporating expanded drone footage, we enhance our coverage of breaking news, local events, weather, and community stories—offering our audiences more compelling and dynamic storytelling.”\nExtensive Drone Program & Partnership with Virginia Tech Sinclair’s Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) program has been operational since 2016 and has already accumulated impressive credentials:\nActive in 50 newsrooms nationwide Completed over 40,000 logged flights Employs 148 FAA-certified pilots Has trained 540 visual observers Central to Sinclair’s success has been its collaboration with Virginia Tech’s Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership (MAAP), an FAA-designated UAS test site. All Sinclair drone pilots undergo rigorous training at MAAP to ensure they possess advanced skills in drone operations and safety procedures.\nTombo Jones, director for the Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership, praised the collaboration: “We have worked for years with Sinclair, helping to train their pilots, and I have always been impressed with their professionalism and commitment to safety. We were proud to build on that theme by using our FAA-approved test method to test a modified drone that allows Sinclair’s pilots to meet the FAA’s stringent safety requirements.”\nSafety First Approach Jeff Rose, Sinclair’s UAS Chief Pilot, emphasized that safety remains the company’s top priority: “Our dedication to safety is paramount and this achievement is the result of more than a year of extensive preparation, testing, and collaboration with industry and government partners.”\nRose noted that Sinclair has conducted community outreach meetings in each market where it operates drones, engaging with first responders, Homeland Security, education officials, local government agencies, and the FAA.\nThis new capability applies to Sinclair’s entire fleet of drones and trained pilots, positioning the company as an industry leader in integrating cutting-edge technology into broadcast journalism while maintaining compliance with the highest safety standards.",
