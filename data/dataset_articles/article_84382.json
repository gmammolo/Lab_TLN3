  "text": "Speakers and participants of the workshop\n99x, in collaboration with SLASSCOM, recently organised a hands-on security workshop, ‘Wanderers Above the Sea of Vulnerabilities,’ to address the growing need for professionals to safeguard software systems against evolving cybersecurity threats. Led by 99x security experts Arjuna De Silva, Kanishka Abeykoon, and Kushantha Rajaratne, the workshop provided participants with an in-depth learning experience tailored to real-world challenges.\nSpanning three days, the workshop offered a deep dive into security testing, equipping participants with practical skills to identify and address vulnerabilities. Guided through a variety of exercises, they explored security flaws in web applications, APIs, and mobile platforms, while real-time demonstrations and group activities helped them develop and execute targeted test cases to detect common attack vectors. This hands-on, structured approach seamlessly transitioned them from understanding core security principles to practical execution, ensuring they could immediately apply their newfound knowledge to their work.\n99x Senior Manager IT and Security Operations Arjuna De Silva highlighted, “This workshop was more than just a training session; it was a transformative experience designed to empower software developers and QA professionals to incorporate security best practices into their Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Our focus was to shift security left, ensuring that security is not an afterthought but an integral part of the development process.”\nOne of the most valuable aspects of the workshop was the collaborative learning environment, where attendees engaged with experts and peers, exchanging insights and discussing the latest trends in cybersecurity.\nSLASSCOM Executive Director Chaminda de Silva shared, “Through this partnership, SLASSCOM is committed to offering professionals a valuable platform to enhance their cybersecurity skills. These initiatives are important in building a tech community that integrates security throughout the development lifecycle. As the demand for such workshops continues to grow, we aim to challenge the traditional view of security as a specialised role and instead promote its importance as a shared responsibility, making us much stronger as an industry.”\nAs a leader in product engineering, 99x continuously focuses on knowledge-sharing initiatives, driving positive change across the industry. Building on feedback from previous workshops, this year’s event was further refined to meet the industry’s evolving needs, with the continued support from organisations that dedicated three full days to enhancing their employees’ skill sets highlighting the growing commitment within the tech community to prioritising secure software development.\nLooking ahead, 99x remains dedicated in its mission to educate, inspire and lead the charge in cybersecurity awareness. As future programs and advanced sessions take shape, this initiative is one of many steps toward building a more secure and resilient tech ecosystem.",
