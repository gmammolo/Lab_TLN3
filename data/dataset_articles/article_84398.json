  "text": "Key Takeaways Nintendo is bringing GameCube games to Nintendo Switch Online. The first wave of GameCube titles includes The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, Soulcalibur 2, and F-Zero GX. Further GameCube titles like Super Mario Sunshine and Luigi’s Mansion will be added later.\nNintendo is finally bringing GameCube games to its Nintendo Switch Online subscription, and its first wave is bringing some of its greatest hits, though you’ll need a Switch 2 in order to play the games.\nAdditionally, Nintendo is launching a GameCube Nintendo Switch 2 controller for those who want to relive the console’s glory days.\nRELATED Nintendo Switch 2 Games That Will Be Available at Launch The presentation event for the Nintendo Switch 2 has been truly incredible, and Nintendo has given us plenty of reasons to get excited about the new console.\nGameCube Games Are Finally Coming to Nintendo Switch Online As revealed during today’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, the first initial wave of GameCube titles to arrive the same day as the Switch 2 launch are:\nThe Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker Soulcalibur 2 F-Zero GX Further titles will be added at a later date, with the following ones confirmed so far:\nSuper Mario Sunshine Super Mario Strikers Luigi’s Mansion Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness Pokémon Colosseum Chibi-Robo! Additionally, Switch 2 owners will have the opportunity to purchase a GameCube Wireless Controller for the Switch 2. This controller will be fully compatible with GameCube games and have some Switch 2 features added to it. It will be released on the same day as Switch 2’s launch and retail for $64.99.\nAll I can say is that it’s about time, though sadly, you’ll need a Nintendo Switch 2 to play these. Still, I’m glad to see them get added, and I cannot wait to see what other games get added to the service. My fingers are crossed that we see Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes, a remake of the original Metal Gear Solid, added to the service, as it’s one of the few Metal Gear Solid games that has yet to get a re-release of any kind.\nOther than that, what GameCube game are you hoping to see eventually become available on the service?\nRELATED Nintendo Announces Cheaper Switch 2 Model for Japan With Restrictions to Stop Foreign Buyers Nintendo has unveiled details about the pricing and launch date of its new Nintendo Switch 2, with a notable pricing strategy for Japan.",
