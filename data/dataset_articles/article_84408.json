  "text": "Company’s unmatched AI-powered EV analytics recognized for pioneering the future of grid management\nBidgely’s artificial intelligence (AI)-powered EV Intelligence solution has been named a 2025 Top Product of the Year in the prestigious E+E Leader Product & Project Awards - an annual program honoring excellence in products and services that provide companies with significant energy and environmental benefits. E+E Leader recognized Bidgely’s EV Intelligence solution as an outstanding example of innovation in empowering utilities to alleviate electric vehicle (EV) charging-related grid congestion and paving the road to smarter load management.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250401599951/en/\nE+E Leader recognizes Bidgely’s EV Intelligence solution for empowering utilities to alleviate EV charging-related grid congestion and paving the road to smarter load management.\n\"Every year, our judges look to recognize the businesses that are truly moving the needle and striving for sustainability and operational efficiency,\" says Kay Harrison, VP and head of the E+E Leader Awards program. \"This year’s winners exemplify the kind of forward-thinking strategies and technologies that companies need to stay ahead in an increasingly complex energy and environmental landscape.\"\nActionable EV Data with 98% Accuracy\nBidgely's patented EV Intelligence solution addresses the challenge of identifying and managing EV charging impacts on the grid. While most competing methods struggle to distinguish EV charging data from other large household appliances, Bidgely's AI-driven disaggregation of smart meter data delivers unmatched 98 percent accuracy for Level 1 and Level 2 charger detection — arming utilities with information needed for critical initiatives like shifting peak load and managed charging.\nUtilities across the U.S. have deployed Bidgely’s EV Intelligence solution to, for example, target customers with high-value baseline charging behavior for enrollment in managed charging pilots, resulting in 3X increases in peak demand reduction per vehicle.\nGenAI Rapidly Simulates Future Grid Impacts of EVs\nE+E Leader also recognized Bidgely’s EV Intelligence solution for its GenAI integration, which enables utilities to perform staggered charging and long-term grid impact simulations rapidly and intuitively. This opens up new possibilities for utilities to optimize supply and demand, defer unnecessary infrastructure upgrades and prioritize critical assets.\n\"This award further validates our belief that intelligent EV solutions are critical for a sustainable future. It's a tribute to the collaborative spirit that's enabling utilities to turn the challenge of EV charging into an opportunity for grid resilience and efficiency,\" said Gautam Aggarwal, Chief Revenue Officer of Bidgely. \"We're excited to lead the charge toward a smarter, more resilient energy grid.\"\n\"The winners of this year’s E+E Leader Awards are tackling some of the most pressing sustainability and energy challenges with real-world, scalable solutions,\" says Sarah Roberts, Co-President of E+E Leader and C-Suite Compass LLC. \"These projects and products push industry standards forward and are setting new benchmarks for innovation and impact.\"\nTo learn how utilities are using Bidgely’s AI-powered EV solution to develop targeted EV load management programs, visit: bidgely.com/solutions/ev/.\nAbout Environment+Energy Leader\nSince 2006, Environment+Energy Leader’s website and newsletters have provided the definitive and objective voice in reporting on business-related energy, environmental, and sustainability issues.
