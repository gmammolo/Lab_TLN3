  "text": "Jeep has released new pictures of the 2026 Compass, ahead of its debut this spring. The model rides on the STLA Medium platform and will be offered with three different powertrains. Italian production begins later this year, although a U.S. launch could be delayed due to tariffs. The teaser campaign for the redesigned Jeep Compass is kicking into high gear as the company has tapped photographer Alessandro Dobici to do a shoot at the Melfi plant, where the crossover will be built. The resulting images are a fashionable black and white blur.\nWhile Jeep isn’t saying much, they promised the Compass will retain a seven-slot grille and trapezoidal wheel arches. The teasers also show a Recon -like front fascia with slender headlights as well as lenses that feature a grille motif.\nMore: New Jeep Compass Shows Its Face, Debuts This Spring\nSpeaking of the grille, it appears to incorporate some illuminated accents. Elsewhere, we can see a pronounced rear spoiler and what appears to be wheels with another grille motif.\nThe interior pictures don’t reveal much, but we can see familiar “Since 1941” wording. We also get a glimpse of contrast stitching and “Jeep” embroidery.\nThe automaker was coy on specifics, but said the Compass will play a “crucial role” in their electrification strategy. Jeep went on to say customers can expect an “expanded engine range with e-Hybrid, e-Hybrid plug-in, and fully electric options.”\nJeep kicked off the teaser campaign last October, when they revealed a sketch of the model and some initial details. At the time, they said the Compass would be based on the STLA Medium platform and go into production in Italy in 2025. They later confirmed a European debut for this spring.\nA North American launch was originally slated for 2026, but reports have suggested the model is on hold as it was supposed to be built at Brampton Assembly in Canada. With a 25% tariff on imports, the model’s U.S. prospects look grim so Stellantis is said to be rethinking its product strategy .",
