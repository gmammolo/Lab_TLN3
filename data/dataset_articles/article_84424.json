  "text": "Solana, one of the top blockchain platforms, continues a rapid surge in its token creation. As per the data from SolanaFloor, just in March, the platform witnessed the creation of over 1.15M SPL tokens. The platform took to social media to reveal this significant increase in a recent X post.\nSolana’s Latest Minted SPL Tokens Reach 1.15M Mark in March\nIn line with the data from Solscan, the latest minted SPL tokens have seen a fluctuating yet consistent rise in their amount. This substantial figure highlights a dominant position of Solana as a blockchain dealing with decentralized applications and token generation. Additionally, in the recent 3 months, token launches touched their peak in January’s end and February’s start. In this respect, their number rose above 90,000 at some points.\nAlthough the overall amount decreased in March, the platform still saw a noteworthy daily average of more than 40,000 latest token launches. This reportedly supported the resilient growth of the Solana ecosystem. Particularly, over the recent week, the token creation went through a steady growth. Hence, from March 26 to April 1, the latest minted SPL tokens stayed persistent with a daily average amount ranging between 30,000 and 40,000.\nDevelopment Underscores Growing Adoption of Solana Based on Exclusive Advancements\nConcurrently, Solana’s NFT sector has additionally shown a remarkable activity. Throughout the week, the latest created NFTs have been oscillating from 9,000 to 18,000 in terms of number. The peak took place on the 31st of March when this number touched the staggering, single minting of 18,000 latest assets. According to SolanaFloor, the minting of up to 1.15M SPL tokens is a milestone. A key factor behind this achievement is the provision of high scalability, cost-effective transactions, and a seamless blockchain infrastructure.",
