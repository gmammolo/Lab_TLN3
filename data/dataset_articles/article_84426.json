  "text": "Gearbox Entertainment dropped some huge news during the Nintendo Direct on April 2, 2025, at 6 AM PDT, announcing that Borderlands 4 will launch on the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025. This reveal has electrified fans of the beloved looter-shooter series, known for its chaotic gameplay and irreverent humor. The news marks a significant moment for both Gearbox and Nintendo enthusiasts, promising to bring the franchise’s signature madness to a new portable platform.\nRandy Pitchford, founder and president of Gearbox Entertainment, delivered the announcement himself during the Nintendo Direct. He confirmed that Borderlands 4 will hit the Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2025, though an exact date remains under wraps. For comparison, the game’s release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC is scheduled for September 23, 2025, giving fans a rough timeline to anticipate. Pitchford talked about the title as “the most ambitious Borderlands game we’ve ever made,” hinting at expansive features like a bigger open world, refined mechanics, or even upgraded visuals tailored to next-gen hardware.\nSince its debut in 2009, Borderlands has built a legacy on its wild gunplay, colorful characters, and endless loot. This fourth installment could push those elements further, potentially introducing new vault hunters or innovative co-op features that the series is famous for.\nSet to release on June 5, 2025, the Nintendo Switch 2 is already generating buzz with its upgraded hardware. Borderlands 4 could be a flagship title for the console, though it’s unclear if it’ll be a launch game or arrive later in the year. The Switch 2’s enhanced capabilities might deliver smoother frame rates and sharper graphics, making it the first time the franchise’s fast-paced action feels at home in a handheld format. This move also underscores Nintendo’s push to secure major third-party support.\nThe announcement sparked immediate reactions online. Gearbox’s own @DuvalMagic tweeted, “Borderlands 4 is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025. Let’s GO!” Major outlets like IGN praised the crossover, while Gamesradar highlighted its potential to draw in new players.\nFor longtime Borderlands 4 fans, the Switch 2 version offers a chance to blast through Pandora’s wastelands on the go. Gearbox teased that more reveals, perhaps a trailer or gameplay footage. They are coming soon, keeping the hype alive. Stay tuned to Total Apex Gaming for the latest updates. This could be one of 2025’s defining releases, blending portability with the series’ chaotic charm.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
