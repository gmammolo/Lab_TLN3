  "text": "Many people have played and thoroughly enjoyed Deltarune. It’s a beautiful game with a wonderful story, but there hasn’t been any content for a few years. However, in the recent April 2nd Nintendo Direct, there were many games announced for the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2. After much anticipation, Toby Fox, the creator of the very popular indie games Undertale and Deltarune, has officially announced the new chapters for Deltarune, those being Chapters 3 and 4. Fans have been waiting since September of 2021 for these new additions to the franchise, and fans were sent into much excitement upon this announcement!\nDeltarune’s gameplay has always had a unique feel to it, which set it apart from other RPGs, including Undertale. The newest chapters are sure to continue and refine the mechanics that have been established while also expanding onto newer and unique mechanics. New items and abilities will open up fresh strategies, offering a variety of ways that will suit anyone and everyone! That’s not all, though! As seen in the reveal trailer, there appear to be more mini-games and scenes for players to experience, such as the rhythm game where the trio plays different parts of a song! (Susie goes crazy on the drums, for the record)\nAs expected, the trio of Kris, Susie, and Ralsei return and continue their adventure, along with their (not actual, more honorary) party member Lancer. Enemies spared and befriended from previous chapters also return, such as Rudin and Hathy from Chapter 1. Most notable of them all is Queen, who is – spoiler – the main antagonist of Chapter 2. The new antagonists, as of writing this, appear to be a TV with a sinister smile and laugh for Chapter 3. For Chapter 4, the only hint in the trailer is this horde of black creatures with a white circle for a face chasing Susie and Kris. As of now, no one can say for sure…\nIn classic Toby Fox action, he’ll be sure to bring new and stellar soundtracks for the newest releases. Toby Fox’s compositions always continue to shine, from somber melodies, upbeat tracks, and to energetic battle tracks, there will be many new additions to be had. While there are sure to be returning tracks, like the track for Hometown and Ralsei’s Castle, there are bound to be many unique hits!\nApart from what’s written above, we’ll be able to see a deeper dive into Deltarune’s story. Chapters 3 and 4 are sure to expand on the lore and mystery behind said story. Players will be able to experience new Dark Worlds and the unique charm that comes with each one. Not only that, but Chapters 3 and 4 will most likely have secret bosses, like Jevil from Chapter 1 and Spamton NEO from Chapter 2. Along with the Snowgrave route in Chapter 2, there may be other paths to look forward to in the new releases. There will be many secrets to be unwound!\nWhile fans wait in anticipation for Chapters 3 and 4 to release, that begs an inevitable question: What comes next? Toby Fox isn’t going to give away too much about future chapters. It’s more than clear that the story is far from over. It appears that Chapters 5 through 7 are planned out. Chapter 5 was originally going to be released alongside 3 and 4, but it was cut and set for a later, unannounced release date (as of now). At the very least, the new releases have reignited the Deltarune hype and will set the stage for what will eventually be later chapters.\nWhile still a couple of months away from actually being released, many fans’ reactions have proved that it’s been worth the several-year wait. With new mysteries to solve, special mechanics to be introduced, and the ever-unforgettable cast of characters that’ll keep expanding as Chapters 3 and 4 release, the legacy of Deltarune (and, to an extent, Undertale) will continue. Whether you’ve been following since the start of Undertale or are jumping in for the very first time, there’s no better time than now to experience the masterpiece that is Deltarune.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
