  "text": "Distressed, exhausted after days of travel and in desperate need of help, here we go. This humpback whale has been wrapped in thick rope, towing heavy boys for weeks. We&#039;ve got possible lines there. You&#039;ve got a line underneath as well, trailing underneath the flow. This rope had cut well through probably a foot 2 foot through its back in a number of areas. As light faded off the coast of Yamba late Thursday, the Gold Coast Rescue Team took their chance, their desperate efforts falling short as it became too dangerous in darkness. For nine days the whale was being tracked after first being spotted at Batemans Bay, travelled more than 1000 kilometres before help arrived back again on Friday. The team had a narrow window before conditions turned, an added complication. This whale had a companion that never left its side. We put these big marker buoys on it and that&#039;s to to actually slow the animal down to tire it. After four gruelling hours, coming up, finally freed. He&#039;s moving. Why? Come on, mate, look at him go. At that moment when when the last bit of gear came off it, it was such relief. It&#039;s an amazing feeling, other than the injuries from all the rope that the the animal might do quite well. It&#039;s the team&#039;s second major operation in a week after another incredible rescue off Fingle Head. And with reports of other animals coming up that hopefully we can intercept. So it&#039;s gearing up to be unfortunately a very, very busy season. Gracie Richter. 9 News.",
