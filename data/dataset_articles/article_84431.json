  "text": "Silksong will release this year This is not a drill. During this afternoon's Nintendo Direct dedicated to Switch 2, we got the briefest of looks at Silksong. Yes, guys, it finally happened.\nNow, by brief, I really mean brief. Silksong was shared as part of a collection of games coming to the console in the future.\nBUT, here is where the news is at. Along with this snippet, Nintendo confirmed Silksong will be released this year. A 2025 date was attached to the snippet. So, yes, it isn't exactly a super firm release date, but it's much more…\nVictoria Kennedy",
