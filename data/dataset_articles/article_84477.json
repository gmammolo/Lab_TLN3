Top among the winners, who were recognized April 2 during an award ceremony at the Bridge Stage on the ISC West show floor, was IronYun, receiving the 2025 Best New Product Award.\nSince its inception in 1979, SIA NPS has been the security industry’s premier product awards program. New products are reviewed by a panel of judges with extensive industry experience, and in 2025, following significant deliberations, the 38 judges presented awards for technologies covering 33 product and service categories. The 2025 SIA NPS Awards entries will be on display through Friday, April 4, in Booth #25075 on the ISC West show floor, adjacent to the Bridge Stage (Booth #25059).\nIronYun received the Best New Product honor for its Vaidio 9.0 AI Vision Platform product, submitted in the Loss Prevention and Article Surveillance Solutions category.\n“Vaidio 9.0 enhances loss prevention by combining advanced [artificial intelligence] models, heuristic rules and intelligent compute management to deliver precise analytics for detecting theft and reducing inventory shrinkage,” said IronYun. “Its unique orchestration of CNN, transformer and VLM models increases accuracy, reduces compute consumption and improves speed, while integrating seamlessly with existing infrastructure.”\nThe prestigious Judges’ Choice Award was presented to Robotic Assistance Devices (RAD) for the SARA – AI Security Agent for Autonomous Threat Detection and Response product, submitted in the Threat Detection and Response Solutions category.\n“SARA revolutionizes [global security operations centers] and monitoring by transforming passive surveillance into real-time, AI-driven engagement,” said RAD. “This autonomous security agent detects threats, interacts with individuals, verifies intent and escalates incidents as needed, enhancing security efficiency, reducing operator fatigue, preventing overlooked events and ensuring faster, smarter and more effective incident response across diverse environments.”\n“This year’s SIA NPS program has had another fantastic year with amazing new products and solutions presented to our judging panels,” said Christine Bergeron, chair of the SIA NPS Awards Committee and senior director of global physical security technology at Visa. “Thank you to our expert judges and committee members for your dedication to the program and lending your expertise and valuable time to contribute to a successful 2025 SIA NPS program.”\n“The SIA NPS Awards are a renowned global platform for highlighting new offerings each year, and earning recognition is an impressive accomplishment,” said Elisa Mula, vice chair of the SIA NPS Awards Committee and founder and protection management specialist at EM Designs. “SIA applauds this year’s winners, who impressed our judges after an extensive process of tech demonstrations and panel-driven judging.”\nAdditionally, CyberLock received the NPS Merit Award, which recognizes an individual or company who, through their support of the SIA NPS Awards, demonstrates a commitment to the vision and mission of the program, contributes to its success and promotes the advancement of SIA and the security industry overall.\n“SIA congratulates all the winners of the 2025 SIA NPS Awards, and especially IronYun and Robotic Assistance Devices, whose products stood out among the entries to earn the Best New Product and Judges’ Choice distinctions, as well as SIA NPS Merit Award winner CyberLock,” said SIA CEO Don Erickson. “Each year, NPS presents the most cutting-edge products available on the market today, and our judges’ dedication, support and thorough consideration are invaluable in maintaining it as the most trusted awards program for launching new security technology solutions.”\nThe 2025 SIA NPS award winners are:\nBest New Product Award\n- Winner: IronYun – Vaidio 9.0 AI Vision Platform\nJudges’
