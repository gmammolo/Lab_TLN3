  "text": "By Nora Eckert and Kalea Hall DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor plans to announce discounts across multiple models starting on Thursday, three sources said, leaning on its healthy inventory to offer customers thousands off their vehicles as some competitors have hiked prices to absorb added costs from tariffs. The Dearborn, Michigan, car company will offer its employee pricing, a discounted rate available to Ford workers, to all customers, the sources said. The program will be called the \"From America for America\" plan, one of the sources said. Ford declined to comment. The automaker said it builds 80% of its U.S.-sold vehicles domestically, buffering itself more from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs than some competitors. However, it is still facing the prospect of steep levies on imported vehicle parts. (Reporting by Nora Eckert; editing by Diane Craft)",
