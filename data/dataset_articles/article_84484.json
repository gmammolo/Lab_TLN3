  "text": "( NewsNation ) — NASA astronaut Sunita Williams released a video of her reunion with her two dogs after spending nine months onboard the International Space Station . Williams posted the clip Sunday on X with the caption, “Best homecoming ever!” The video, which has received more than 330,000 views, shows Williams greeting her happy dogs. One gets so excited that it picks up a stick and trots around the front yard, wagging its tail. Williams and NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore from Middle Tennessee, along with two other astronauts, returned to Earth on March 18. The astronauts flew to the ISS in June 2024 as part of a test flight for Boeing’s Starliner capsule. They had been expected to return just a week or so later. Problems cropped up on the way to the space station, however, and NASA eventually sent the Starliner back empty. The test pilots were transferred to a SpaceX return flight schedule for February, but it was ultimately delayed another month. The astronauts returned to Earth in a capsule that splashed down off the coast of Florida last month. For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to WKRN News 2.",
