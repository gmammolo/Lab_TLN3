  "text": "The first Nintendo Switch 2 Direct was a roaring success, as it confirmed lots of exciting things that fans have requested, including a practically open-world Mario Kart game and the addition of Nintendo GameCube titles to Nintendo Switch Online. The Nintendo Switch 2 is also adding video chat via the GameChat function, though it has one huge restriction that fans might not like.\nNow that the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct is out of the way, fans can actually be excited for things more than magnets and grainy footage of a new Mario Kart game. The system is actually loaded with cool new features, including the implementation of a chat feature that fans have wanted for several systems now, yet Nintendo keeps dragging its feet, at least until 2025.\nNintendo’s Strange Chat History on the Switch Voice Chat On Nintendo Switch Has Been Very Limited Close Nintendo has always been slow to adapt to modern trends , and nowhere is this truer than with online play and communication between players. The dreadful quality of most of Nintendo’s servers is a symptom of this, and it’s why people who love online multiplayer tend to look at other platforms.\nThe restriction of communication between players online makes some sense, as Nintendo has always presented itself as a family-friendly company. That reputation will quickly melt away if kids enter online matches in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and start getting called slurs by the adult players who should know better.\nRelated The Best Game Boy Games That Aren't on Nintendo Switch Online (Yet) Some of the best Game Boy games, including Pokémon Red and Blue and Tetris 2, have yet to make an appearance on Nintendo Switch Online.\nPosts Nintendo took a very tentative step in allowing online contact during the Switch era, but it was a very bad one. Enter the Nintendo Switch Online app , which allowed multiple players to talk to each other via their phones. This service had a ton of restrictions, including requiring an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription to use.\nMany fans quickly realized that playing with friends was easier via the regular chat apps, like Discord and Whatsapp . It was also easier to set up communication in those apps, so why bother with the Nintendo Switch Online method? The whole situation felt like a botched experiment, as Nintendo doesn’t want full voice chat, not when it has such a large audience of families to protect.\nNintendo Switch 2 GameChat Finally Adds Video Chat The Switch 2 Is Finally Catching Up With Other Consoles\nImage Via Nintendo The age of silence is over, as the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct unveiled GameChat: the system’s video chat functionality . When active, the player can communicate or share their screen with up to three players. The group doesn’t have to be playing the same game, as the chat can simply share the screen of what’s happening at that moment in time. This was demonstrated by people playing Mario Kart World and all being in the same instance, with all four chats active at once. It’s also possible to shrink/enlarge the windows, depending on how busy the main player is, as gawking at someone playing Balan Wondeworld might not be wise for anyone trying to beat Malenia in the Nintendo Switch 2 port of Elden Ring .\nIn terms of technology, GameChat uses the built-in mic on the Nintendo Switch 2 to collect the voice of the player, and it will apparently do so even if there are loud noises in the room. The mic also works in handheld mode. While the built-in mic is used for voice, players will need to purchase the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera if they want to appear on-screen themselves, as they can do a Zoom meeting effect, where they appear in the foreground. Certain games can also turn the video feed into in-game assets, such as Mario Party having each player’s head above their character.\nIt bears mentioning that GameChat has a huge drawback: the frame rate . The footage shown during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct , which was meant to showcase the feature at its best, had the absolute worst garbage frame rate imaginable. Chances are, GameChat is going to look even worse with people of varying Internet speeds.\nRelated 10 Forgotten Nintendo Characters Who Belong In Mario Kart 9 Mario Kart 9 has the chance to dust off some forgotten and underutilized Nintendo characters and bring them back as race kart drivers.\nPosts 3 In order to use the GameChat functionality, players will need to hit the mysterious new C Button, which was first revealed by leaks, but was only spoken about during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. A lot of people guessed the C stood for “chat” and they were correct. Pressing the C button brings up the different GameChat options, so it’s all within easy access, and muting the mic/cutting the video feed is all within a single button click away.\nAs it’s an online service, players will need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription in order to use GameChat, but it will be free for early adopters until March 31, 2026 . This means that people don’t have to pay for the online chat for nearly a year, so Nintendo is at least bold about promoting the service. However, considering that Nintendo Switch 2 will add GameCube titles (via the Expansion Pass), it wouldn’t be surprising to see people already hooked to the service without needing to utilize the freebie.\nConsidering Nintendo has its family-friendly image to consider, there are also extensive Parental Controls for GameChat. Parents with kids who own a Nintendo Switch 2 can set the Parental Controls, so that they can control when and who they can use the video chat feature with. This is controlled with a phone app, which makes it clear which people are attempting to engage with GameChat, even if they’ve changed their in-game name at some point in time.\nIt all sounds perfect. However, Nintendo being Nintendo, they had to throw one major caveat into the mix. GameChat might have a lot of positive features, but those expecting something as free-form as what’s available on PCs and other consoles have another thing coming.\nThe Big Caveat to GameChat On Nintendo Switch 2 It's Time to Start Sharing Switch Friend Codes\nImage Via Nintendo As confirmed by the official Nintendo website, anyone who wants to use GameChat can only do so with people on their Friend List. This means no random encounters with people met online in games like Mario Kart World , as it’s only possible to use GameChat with those already known by the player.\nWhile not the biggest shock in the world, it’s a shame that Nintendo didn’t include an option for people who can confirm their age to have GameChat unlocked. Then again, it would probably be more hassle than it’s worth, both from a programming standpoint and from a PR standpoint.\nRelated 10 Features Mario Kart 9 Needs If Nintendo Wants It To Be Better Than MK8 Nintendo revealed that a new Mario Kart game is coming to the Switch 2, and it will need certain features to overcome Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.\nPosts All it would take is for a few articles about people being awful to strangers via Nintendo Switch 2 GameChat for Nintendo to have to start weathering a PR nightmare. If GameChat wasn’t locked to the Friend List, then people would be racing to see who would be the first to get banned from the service.\nOf course, there’s nothing stopping friends from acting the fool with each other, and if anyone is being a jerk, there’s also a report option, ensuring people stay in line. These things just have to be contained in a bubble, and if people act like scumbags, then the consumer has no recourse if they’re the ones adding them to their Friend List.\nGameChat Is a Big Step Forward for Nintendo GameChat Shows Nintendo Is Willing to Embrace New Ideas Close Friend List limitations aside, the implementation of GameChat is an awesome upgrade for the Nintendo Switch 2. The presence of the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera also feels like a precursor to a new iteration down the road , one that has a camera built, kind of like the Game Boy Camera from back in the day. The framerate in GameChat is already at the same level as the Game Boy Camera , so the Switch 2’s own camera may as well stick out the top.\nRelated 10 Nintendo Characters We Need To See In Mario Kart 9 These are the fantastic and iconic Nintendo characters that badly deserve a place on the roster of the upcoming Mario Kart 9 for the Switch 2.\nPosts The feature feels tailor-made for games with great co-op gameplay, like Animal Crossing: New Horizons and PowerWash Simulator . The ability to share a screen natively with a friend online without needing any additional hardware is a great one, and it will be fascinating to see the weird ways in which Nintendo utilizes this hardware quirk.\nWhen the Nintendo Switch 2 was revealed, people were annoyed that it seemingly had no hardware gimmicks like the other Nintendo systems before it. Well, the GameChat feature fills that role perfectly, especially in an age with so many great online games that can be enjoyed with friends.\nNintendo Switch",
