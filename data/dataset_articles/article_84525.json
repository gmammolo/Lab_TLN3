  "text": "INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — OrthoIndy is pioneering the use of artificial intelligence in operating rooms, even using it to guide invasive surgery. It’s one of five sites using Surgical Theater , an AI imaging technology, for spinal surgery. OrthoIndy spinal surgeon Dr. Greg Poulter said, “It’s a tool for the artisan. If you really care as a surgeon about doing a better job, this tool is revolutionary.” Partly developed from fighter pilot training technology, Surgical Theater builds a 3D model to help plan a surgery, practice techniques, and guide the surgeon through the planned procedure. It’s not generative AI, where the software fabricates images or fills in the blanks. Surgical Theater’s AI imaging is based on CT scans and MRIs, which Poulter says is accurate within the millimeter. Using a headset, a surgeon can view an augmented reality roadmap of the patient’s anatomy along with a pre-planned method to operate; guiding the surgery. “Historically in spine surgery, we’re looking at an MRI or an X-ray. … Then we come to the operating room with our patient, and we just have to figure out how we’re going to do it,” Poulter said. Surgical Theater “provides not only a level of safety that’s never been there before, but a level of precision.” Luke Isenbarger had put off treating his back for years, living with pain on a daily basis. “It has an effect on everything. Your daily attitude, your daily lifestyle, and not being able to keep up with the kids, physically.” After consulting with professionals at OrthoIndy, he felt comfortable going through with surgery, largely because he could see how the procedure would happen through the virtual model. “To me, it’s genius,” Insenbarger said. Twenty-two sites are using the technology for brain surgery.",
