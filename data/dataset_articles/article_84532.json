  "text": "Universal is ready to sink its teeth into its live-action remake of How to Train Your Dragon 2 .\nThe studio announced during its presentation at CinemaCon on Wednesday that the feature sequel is set to hit theaters June 11, 2027. The first live-action How to Train Your Dragon , based on DreamWorks Animation’s hit 2010 animated movie of the same name, is coming out June 13.\nFranchise mainstay Dean DeBlois returns for the sequel, along with castmembers Mason Thames as Hiccup and Nico Parker as Astrid. DeBlois, who has been involved with the franchise since its start, wrote and directed this year’s How to Train Your Dragon that is based on the 2010 project that he co-directed with Chris Sanders.\nDeBlois, Parker and fellow castmember Gerard Butler took the stage to announce the sequel.\nUniversal is clearly hot on the live-action How to Train Your Dragon , as the full film — focusing on Hiccup befriending the dragon Toothless — screened earlier Wednesday for CinemaCon attendees.\nThe animated How to Train Your Dragon 2 hit theaters in 2014 and featured the voices of Jay Baruchel, Cate Blanchett, Gerard Butler and America Ferrera. The plot for the Oscar-nominated film centers on Hiccup (Baruchel) and Toothless uncovering a plot to harness an army of dragons.\nDuring a press event for the live-action How to Train Your Dragon that The Hollywood Reporter attended earlier this year, DeBlois discussed the origins of this summer’s movie.\n“With the rushed production schedule and the limited resources that we had on that first movie for DreamWorks, there were things that we skipped past that we could have maybe done a little more justice to — some of the characters, some of the depth of relationships and the immersive action,” he said. “It’s a reimagining that holds quite faithful to the story and yet finds moments where we could enrich character relationships, give a bit of depth, give a little bit of mythology that might have been lacking in that original.”\nThe franchise was inspired by the book series from author Cressida Cowell. Serving as producers on the live-action movies are DeBlois, Marc Platt and Adam Siegel.",
