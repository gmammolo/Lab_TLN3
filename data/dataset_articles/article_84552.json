  "text": "GARY — Students at Williams Elementary School are learning more about science with help from Indiana University Northwest's Chemistry Club.\nAs part of the school's STEM, which is short for science, technology, engineering and math, club, students meet once a month and spend half their time with the chemistry club and the other half learning about robotics from local electricians.\nThe STEM club was formed in August by Tomeka Pope, the school's STEM instructor. Pope said she had originally organized a STEM day last year for her classes, something that became popular with the students.\nAt the same time, members of the chemistry club were invited to do chemistry demonstrations during Williams' back-to-school event. Pope reached out to the group and asked if they would be willing to partner with the school for the STEM club.\nDuring their meeting on Tuesday, IUN chemistry and physics lecturer Linda Wozniewski gave the students a lesson on polymers — compound materials made up of similar smaller units bonded together. After the lesson, students took part in different activities, such as determining the density of plastic beads by placing them in different liquids, placing fibers of different materials above a candle flame to determine whether they're natural or synthetic and looking at dog hairs through a microscopes\n\"You get to do cool sciences things and you get to do cool experiments,\" said Williams student Prince Smith.\nWozniewski, who developed the club's curriculum, said the lessons have also covered metals, food science, fingerprints and liquids. It'll all cumulate with the students solving a fictional crime next month.\nIUN student Hamza Nasar, who is president of the chemistry club, said it has been an enriching process to work with the students.\n\"They're really inquisitive and curious to see what's going on and how things work,\" Nasar said.\nPope said she's loved having the IUN students volunteer in the STEM club, and that it has motivated students to be involved in science and explore different careers.\nWynter Windfield, another Williams student, said learning how to make a cupcake during the food science lesson has made her more interested in science.\nWozniewski said she hopes to inspire the same level of fascination and interest in STEM that began in her when she was an elementary school student.\n\"Hopefully they will get that same passion for understanding why the world works the way it does and understanding how everything works together,\" Wozniewski said.",
