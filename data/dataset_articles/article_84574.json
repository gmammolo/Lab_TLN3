  "text": "INSTEROID pushes the boundaries of automotive design\n4 minute read\nMega-news for the subcompact EV segment! Hyundai Motor Company has unveiled INSTEROID, a boundary-pushing design concept that blends video game influences with funky and sporty aesthetics, featuring a gaming cockpit and seats. As a pure mobility study, the INSTEROID is not for production but rather a fascinating statement of all that is possible and what’s to come. Hyundai Motors reimagines hot-selling INSTER EV as a ‘dream come true’ design show car aiming to challenge conventions and ignite creativity. Find out what all the buzz is about!\nBuilt on success\nAs the name suggests – the INSTEROID concept car draws its inspiration from the highly successful INSTER EV lineup, which was launched last year and already earned a spot among the top three finalists for the 2025 World Car of the Year award. The INSTEROID is designed to be an INSTER on steroids, combining its funky, playful spirit with extra muscle and power to take the electric subcompact urban SUV segment by storm!\nBold by design\nThe INSTEROID is a daring and visionary design concept that redefines what a compact car can be. While not intended for production, INSTEROID showcases Hyundai Motor’s bold approach to design, blending gaming influences, trends, and customization options to connect with a new generation of drivers. Crafted behind closed doors by Hyundai Motor’s European design team, INSTEROID is a true concept car in every sense. As a radical ‘What if?’ project, INSTEROID pushes the boundaries of creativity by incorporating various inspirational themes, from gaming to sustainability.\nINSTEROID is a beacon of innovation that challenges us to rethink the boundaries of automotive design. By merging the realms of gaming and sporty styling, we are not just imagining the future of mobility; we are shaping it, inviting a new generation of drivers to dream bigger and drive further. Simon Loasby, Senior Vice President and Head of Hyundai Design Center\nGamified design concept boasts sporty styling and eco-conscious materials\nINSTEROID takes the INSTER production model to the next level with sporty, video game-inspired features that include an extended, widened body and track-optimized wheels as well as a prominent wing spoiler, diffuser and wheel arch air flaps for advanced aerodynamics.\nInside, the cockpit offers a stripped-down, gaming-focused layout with bucket seats, a roll cage and a specialized steering wheel creating an immersive driving experience.\nEvery control element — from buttons to instrument cluster — is fully adjustable, reflecting the spirit of a garage-built track machine. Adding to its multisensory experience, INSTEROID produces a unique sound signature, leaving an unforgettable impression.\nThe voice of power\nBuilding upon INSTER’s user-friendly design, INSTEROID aims to transform the driving experience with its Drift Mode, promising competitive thrills paired with light-hearted joy. Playful details, such as the integrated Beat House sound system and Message Grid, enable personalized interactions, further enhancing driver engagement. Scattered throughout the design, the Boost icon represents multiple unique personas, reinforcing the deep emotional connection between car and driver.\nINSTEROID meets recycling\nINSTEROID embodies Hyundai Motor’s commitment to sustainability by pioneering innovative approaches to eco-conscious materials. The interior showcases 3D knit fabric crafted from recycled yarns, using a single-piece, made-to-measure process.\nTo optimize performance and reduce overall weight, lightweight lattice structures are seamlessly integrated. The striking exterior, finished in crisp white, is punctuated by a single bold orange highlight — an unmistakable visual statement. Completing the vision, a reflective race suit with prominent INSTEROID lettering captures the fusion of motorsport culture and youthful expression.\nDedicated to what’s around the curve\nFor Hyundai, shaking things up is always part of the design process. New perspectives, combined with innovation and a commitment to clean mobility, all come together to create a truly unique experience. In January, we expanded consumer choices by launching 'INSTER Cross', targeting customers who enjoy outdoor activities. INSTER is seeing high demand in the global region. Hyundai will launch INSTER in select markets in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Central and South America later this year, delivering a refreshed brand image and a sense of newness to the automotive industry.\nFollow @hyundai on Instagram and YouTube @HyundaiWorldwide for more INSTEROID updates.\nFor more information on INSTER: Hyundai INSTER: New A-Segment Sub-Compact EV Delivers Unique Design with Segment-Leading Range and Versatility",
