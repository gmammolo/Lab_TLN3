  "text": "Amazing software, with an interesting collection of oddities.\nAmazing software, with an interesting collection of oddities.\nPosted Apr 2, 2025 23:24 UTC (Wed) by himi (subscriber, #340)Parent article:\nCatching up with calibre\nThat said, the reason it's the default recommendation isn't that it's beautiful, user-friendly, intuitive or even necessarily entirely coherent - it's the default recommendation because *nothing* comes close to it for functionality and support. Outside the server space it's hard to think of any other piece of Free Software that's so dominant in its niche.\nThere a definitely a lot of oddities about the way it works - the article discussed many. The one that bit me for ages was the behaviour of the downloadable installation script: it wanted to install to system locations, and didn't provide any way to configure this - in particular, attempting to install as a regular user into ~/.local resulted in either a partially broken (but still usable) installation, or needed to be run as root so that it could install some desktop customisation files into locations under /usr. After a bunch of digging into the script I figured out a way to resolve the issues and get it all installed happily under ~/.local - mostly a matter of doing an \"isolated\" install into ~/.local/libexec and then running the calibre_postinstall script separately. I did make an effort to implement some changes to the way the installation script is generated to improve things, but Life(tm) got in the way . . .\nThe statistics collection is something I'd never heard of, and definitely counts as another oddity - it's hard to care too much about *this* particular minor privacy breach (from a personal perspective) in this day and age, but such things should certainly be made more visible.\nAnd Kovid Goyal definitely deserves much respect for his work - calibre is an amazing piece of software and an extraordinarily successful project, and kitty is an excellent terminal, and as a project has been very influential in helping modernise terminal emulators in general.",
