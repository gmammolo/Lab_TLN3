  "text": "Bitcoin (BTC) rallied today right after Donald Trump announced a comprehensive plan to impose retaliatory tariffs on multiple countries.\nStarting at midnight, a 25% straightforward levy will be imposed on imported automobiles. Trump emphasized that American companies are not allowed to sell their cars in many of these markets.\nAlthough the market initially reacted negatively to the news, buyers made their way and pushed the price of BTC to session highs and blew up multiple resistances along the way. BTC went up by 3% and came close to $90,000.\nTrading volumes in the past 24 hours have shot up by 32% after they were unmoved compared to the previous day.\nSolana (SOL) has now gone up by 5.2% possibly as Official Trump (TRUMP) has seen its trading volumes surge after the President’s speech.\nThe market had been waiting for this announcement throughout the day. Imposing tariffs unilaterally on countries is considered a bearish signal as it could lead to higher inflation. This could deter the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates this year.\nIt is the market’s baseline scenario that rates will be cut two times in 2025. If the Fed changes course and scraps those plans, risky assets like cryptocurrencies will move lower.\nAlthough the market reacted positively to the news initially, this may have been an attempt to trap short-sellers as the announcement possibly resulted in retail traders opening short positions.\nBitcoin Short-Sellers Were Wiped During Trump’s Speech Data from CoinGlass shows that nearly $100 million worth of short positions in cryptocurrencies were wiped in the past hour.\nThe daily chart shows that BTC has now retreated from a key resistance it tagged earlier in the session. However, a short-term bullish outlook is still in play as the token has bounced off a key Fibonacci level.\nThe 61.8% retracement level is typically considered a high-value threshold for traders as a bounce off this marker typically results in a significant near-term uptrend for the asset that can push it to a higher high.\nIn the case of BTC, that would mean a retest of the $90,000 resistance – an important resistance level that could catalyze further price increases if bulls overcome the selling pressure.\nHowever, looking at the hourly price action, the sell-off has temporarily stopped at the 61.8% Fibonacci level. It seems that bulls are heavily defending this threshold as a break below would reverse BTC’s uptrend.\nMomentum indicators have already flashed sell signals as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) crossed below the signal line and it currently stands 17% below this important marker.\nThe next hour will be critical to determine where BTC may be heading as a break below this Fibonacci support could result in a big drop that could spill over to tomorrow’s session.\nThe initial target for BTC would be set at the mid-80,000s and the next step would be at around $82,500.\nDespite these temporary setbacks, BTC’s long-term trajectory is still bullish. Analysts predict that the token could rise to $250,000 before the end of the year.\nIf that’s the case, BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL), one of the best-performing crypto presales of this year, offers a great alternative to profit from Bitcoin’s rise to fresh all-time highs through milestone-based rewards.\nBTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Introduces Innovative Compensation Scheme and Raises $4M BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is a fun way to earn passive income as BTC rises. Those who have been in the crypto space enough understand that volatility is the name of the game.\nDespite these recent price swings, BTC’s long-term bull case is intact, meaning that it is not a matter of if but when that the token may rise to $250,000 and possibly beyond as crypto adoption keeps accelerating.\nFor every $25,000 that BTC adds on top of $100,000, a portion of BTCBULL’s circulating supply will be burned. Meanwhile, for every $50,000 increase, token holders will receive a direct airdrop of BTC tokens.\nTo buy BTCBULL, simply head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet. You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to make your investment.\nBuy BTC Bull Token Here",
