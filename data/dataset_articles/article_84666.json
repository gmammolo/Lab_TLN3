  "text": "Rising Incidence Of Hormonal Imbalances Fuels Growth In The Synthetic Hormone Market: A Key Catalyst Accelerating Synthetic Hormones Market Growth in 2025 07-31-2025 06:22 AM CET | Health & Medicine\nPress release from: The Business Research Company Synthetic Hormones Market\nUse code ONLINE30 to get 30% off on global market reports and stay ahead of tariff changes, macro trends, and global economic shifts\nSynthetic Hormones Market Size Valuation Forecast: What Will the Market Be Worth by 2025?\nThe market size for synthetic hormones has experienced robust growth in the past few years. It is anticipated to increase from $6.38 billion in 2024 to $6.77 billion in 2025, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2%. The historic growth of this market can be tied back to factors such as the promotion of animal growth, enhancement of performance, environmental impacts, fertility therapies, and the management of menopause symptoms.\nSynthetic Hormones Market Size Forecast: What's the Projected Valuation by 2029?\nIt is projected that the synthetic hormones market will experience consistent growth in the upcoming years, with its size estimated to reach $8.15 billion in 2029, boasting a CAGR of 4.7%. Factors contributing to this predicted surge include growth in the transgender healthcare sector, an increase in healthcare spending and insurance coverage, achieving regulatory approvals, and expanding the use of synthetic hormones. The forecast period also highlights some major trends such as the emergence of plant-based hormone therapy, the incorporation of hormone therapy into anti-aging treatments, advancements in drug delivery technology, and an emphasis on hormone-free birth control measures.\nView the full report here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/synthetic-hormones-global-market-report\nWhat Are the Drivers Transforming the Synthetic Hormones Market?\nThe synthetic hormones market is poised for growth, largely due to the escalating instances of hormonal imbalances. Hormonal imbalances, characterized by either a surplus or deficiency of hormones in the bloodstream, can result from stress, aging, health conditions, or lifestyle decisions, causing an interruption in the body's normal hormone production and regulation. Synthetic hormones function to monitor bodily operations and alleviate symptoms linked with hormone inadequacies or overages by supplementing or substituting natural hormones. As indicated by the NHS Business Services Authority, a non-departmental public body in the UK, approximately 7.80 million hormone replacement therapy (HRT) units were dispensed in England in 2022, a 35.0% surge compared to the preceding year. Consequently, the synthetic hormones market is experiencing growth in response to the increasingly common instances of hormonal imbalances.\nGet your free sample here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/sample.aspx?id=14515&type=smp\nWhat Long-Term Trends Will Define the Future of the Synthetic Hormones Market?\nProminent companies in the synthetic hormone market are striving to create innovative products like recombinant human growth hormone with the aim of improving their profitability. The recombinant human growth hormone is a lab-made hormone used for managing growth hormone deficiency in children and adults and is also used for treatment of some medical conditions linked with growth hormone deficiency. For example, in February 2022, Pfizer Inc., a pharmaceutical company based out of the US, along with OPKO Health Inc., another US-based company producing medical tests and medications, gained marketing approval for once-weekly NGENLA (somatrogon) injections in the European Union. The injections aim to treat pediatric growth hormone deficiency in children and adolescents aged three or older. This newly introduced long-lasting injection provides an alternate option for individuals dealing with growth problems due to insufficient growth hormone secretion. NGENLA is injected beneath the skin and stays active in the body longer than daily growth hormone injections, making it feasible for weekly usage.\nWhich Segments in the Synthetic Hormones Market Offer the Most Profit Potential?\nThe synthetic hormones market covered in this report is segmented -\n1) By Product Type: Steroid Hormones, Peptide Hormone, Amino Acid Derivatives, Other Product Types\n2) By Route of Administration: Oral, Nasal, Topical, Intravenous\n3) By Application: Growth Hormone Deficiency, Thyroid Hormone Deficiency, Menopause, Male Hypogonadism, Other Applications\n4) By End User: Hospital Pharmacies, Retail Pharmacies, Online Pharmacies\nSubsegments:\n1) By Steroid Hormones: Corticosteroids, Estrogens and Progesterone, Androgens, Progestins\n2) By Peptide Hormones: Insulin, Growth Hormones, Thyroid Stimulating Hormones, Leptin\n3) By Amino Acid Derivatives: Thyroxine (T4), Epinephrine (Adrenaline), Melatonin, Serotonin\n4) By Other Product Types: Vitamin D Derivatives, Prostaglandins, Gonadotropins\nTailor your insights and customize the full report here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/customise?id=14515&type=smp\nWhich Firms Dominate the Synthetic Hormones Market by Market Share and Revenue in 2025?\nMajor companies operating in the synthetic hormones market are Pfizer Inc., Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie Inc., Bristol Myers Squibb Company, Sanofi SA, AstraZeneca PLC, Novartis AG, GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Gilead Sciences Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Novo Nordisk A/S, Merck & Co.
