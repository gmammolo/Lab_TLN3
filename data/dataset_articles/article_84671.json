  "text": "Incredable integrates DEA Lookup.com to automate controlled substance verification and accelerate provider approvals.\n(PRUnderground) July 30th, 2025\nIncredable, the AI-powered credentialing platform developed by parent company, Intiva Health, has announced a new integration with DEA Lookup.com, one of the most trusted verification services for Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) license registrations in the United States. This enhancement provides credentialing teams with seamless, real-time access to verified DEA data, strengthening compliance workflows and accelerating provider approvals.\nThe integration expands Incredable’s growing portfolio of automated verifications, joining licensure checks, sanction monitoring, and expiration alerts into a single, secure, and configurable platform. With DEA Lookup, organizations can now verify controlled substance registrations directly through their Incredable dashboard, eliminating manual steps, spreadsheet imports, and administrative lag.\n“Verification shouldn’t be a bottleneck. It should be an automatic part of every credentialing workflow,” said Ravi Ravinoothala, Director of Technology and Development at Incredable. “By connecting directly to DEA Lookup, we’ve removed the extra steps that slow credentialing teams down.”\nCompliance Tools That Work in the Background\nThe integration adds to Incredable’s growing suite of automated verifications, including licensure checks, sanction monitoring, and expiration alerts. With DEA Lookup built in, users can:\nInstantly match DEA numbers to registrant name and address Receive alerts for expired, inactive, or mismatched registrations Cross-reference DEA status with licensure and certification data Reduce manual steps and approval delays in high-volume environments “Credentialing needs to be both faster and more accurate, especially when controlled substances are involved,” said Alexander C. Candelario, CEO and Chairman of Intiva Health. “Incredable’s DEA integration removes a major friction point. Teams no longer have to chase down DEA data or worry about missing something. It’s all embedded, and always up to date. With more forward-thinking data integrations and automation tools on the horizon, Incredable is only getting faster, smarter, and harder to ignore.”\nWhy DEA Lookup Matters\nDEA Lookup is trusted by thousands of healthcare organizations to confirm prescriptive authority and ensure ongoing compliance. Now, with its data integrated directly into Incredable, credentialing teams can act on accurate, real-time information without leaving their workflow.\n“Compliance should feel like a natural part of the process, not an afterthought,” added Ravi Ravinoothala. “Bringing this data into the platform gives teams full visibility exactly when they need it.”\nDesigned for Real-World Credentialing Challenges\nHealth systems, telehealth providers, and staffing agencies are under pressure to onboard quickly, across multiple states and specialties. This integration supports those efforts by embedding DEA checks into configurable workflows, allowing credentialing teams to flag risks, trigger rules, and stay audit-ready, automatically.\nAnd because Incredable adapts to your internal policies, DEA data can be embedded where it’s most useful: inside provider profiles, within approval workflows, and as part of customizable compliance logic.\nBring Real-Time DEA Verification Into Your Workflow\nThe DEA Lookup integration is now live in Incredable. If your organization handles prescribers across specialties or states, this update can help you reduce delays, eliminate manual verification steps, and tighten compliance with minimal effort.\nExplore how Incredable can streamline your credentialing process at incredable.com, or request a free personalized demo today.\nAbout Incredable\nIntiva Health is revolutionizing the health of healthcare through technology, compliance, and wellness innovation.
