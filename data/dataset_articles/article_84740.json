  "text": "Summary\n- UI improvements in Grounded 2 include a cleaner look and the option to switch between first-person and third-person modes.\n- The game's design is more vibrant and detailed in Grounded 2, making the map easier to understand and enhancing the Ranger Outposts.\n- The Omni-Tool in Grounded 2 streamlines gameplay with versatile functions, while gear customization options allow players to stand out.\nObsidian Entertainment has been one of the biggest RPG developers in the industry since their big hit, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords, in 2004. RPGs quickly became their bread and butter with minimal deviation. Then the pandemic hit, and everyone was stuck inside in 2020, so in July of that year, they released an Early Access version of one of their most ambitious and strange games yet, Grounded.\nRelated\n7 Things to Do First in Grounded 2\nThe sheer amount of things to do in Grounded 2 can get overwhelming for players, resulting in confusion about what needs to be done first.\nThanks to player feedback, Obsidian Entertainment released Grounded in its full version in 2022 and also launched iton more than Xbox platforms. Now, Grounded 2 is here, and already, there are numerous notable improvements from the first game. That doesn’t mean it’s perfect yet, but these are some of the greatest changes made so far.\n7 The UI\nA Cleaner Look\nThe first game had a UI design that was reminiscent of Minecraft. Players could pick up things like candy bars or rocks, and then they would appear at the bottom of the screen in the player’s inventory. It was not a bad UI system for a game with crafting, but the design in Grounded 2 is much cleaner.\nFor console players, it can still be rough navigating between all the shortcut menus, from crafting furniture to gear to equipping weapons in Grounded 2. That comes with the territory, though, as there are so many mechanics to keep track of. Overall, every menu looks much better in Grounded 2, and a lot of it has been conveniently streamlined to make the experience smoother.\n6 Third-Person Appears\nSwitch Anytime\nObsidian Entertainment seemingly unlocked the key to making third-person games this year. Both The Outer Worlds and Grounded are only playable in first-person, but their two sequels are getting third-person support. It’s great to see the faces of the kid heroes in Grounded 2 as players explore now, but there is a caveat to that.\nRelated\nHow to Build Bases in Grounded 2\nHere's how players can build their base in Grounded 2 to place all their resources, loot, and machinery, like a workbench, in a safe location.\nIt’s still easier to fight and pick up items in first-person, which is true of most RPGs that are built primarily with first-person in mind. Still, it’s great that players can go into the menu and switch to third-person anytime they want.\n5 The Design\nLess Dark, More Vibrant\nGoing back to the current version of Grounded after playing Grounded 2 is a bit astounding. The game launched out of Early Access in 2022, and yet somehow, three years later, Obsidian Entertainment has improved its tech so much.\nSide by side, there is a significant difference graphically as everything is more colorful and vibrant in the sequel. The garden in the first game, while large, is darker and a bit more drab. Even though the backyard is still a scary place filled with bugs, it is a more inviting place to jump into in Grounded 2.\n4 The Map\nTerrain That Is Easier To Understand\nThe map has also been improved in Grounded 2 thanks to the UI and graphics upgrade. In the first game, it was hard to tell where anything was while exploring. The map in Grounded 2 has more detail, allowing players to connect what they see in the world with what they see on the map.\nThere’s still a lot of guesswork for some of the exploration options, as it isn’t as detailed as something recent like Donkey Kong Country Bananza, which took map-making to a whole new level. That said, Grounded 2’s map is still an improvement over its predecessor, without a doubt.\n3 The Ranger Outpost\nFallout Says Hello\nAnother design detail that has improved is the Ranger Outposts that players can find for respite. Players will begin in a massive tower that overlooks the backyard, and they won’t find anything quite that large or unique again. However, the Ranger Outposts are now more detailed and feel like little mini Vaults from the Fallout series.\nSince Obsidian Entertainment worked on Fallout: New Vegas, it’s easy to see how they came up with the Ranger Outposts designs this time around. In the original, these shelters were very basic, like the first one players encounter in Grounded, which was no better than a gazebo with some computers in it. In Gounded 2, they feel far move lived-in and a part of the world.\n2 The Omni-Tool\nA Tool For Every Occasion\nIn the first game, one of the first things Grounded wants players to craft is a stone axe to start cutting down plants, such as trees. In the sequel, players are given the Omni-Tool almost immediately in Grounded 2. This handy tool can chop things down infinitely and be upgraded to do other things, like repair items or dig holes.\nRelated\nHow to Cook in Grounded 2\nFood in Grounded 2 needs to be cooked to make it safe to eat; here's how to cook raw food to make it safe to eat.\nThe Omni-Tool can be upgraded to increase its strength and can then cut through bigger materials. While players still have to craft a lot of gear, like weapons and armor, in Grounded 2, it is great to have a set of other tools they don’t have to think about crafting all contained in one handy-dandy unit.\n1 Gear Makes Your Characters Pop\nCustomize To Your Liking\nUnfortunately, there are no typical RPG character customization options when players choose their kids at the beginning of Grounded 2. Players can at least craft a wide range of armor and weapons to make their chosen character stand out more.\nOverall, the designs of the gear have been improved and feature a lot more detail than in the original game. It can still look awkward to wear leaves and bug carcasses as armor, but Monster Hunter fans have gotten used to this type of gear crafting for decades now. In Grounded 2, players will likely be happy with what they have.\nGrounded 2\n- Released\n- 2025-07\n- ESRB\n- Teen / Violence, Blood\n- Developer(s)\n-\nObsidian Entertainment - Publisher(s)\n- Xbox Game Studios\n- Engine\n- Unreal Engine 5\n- Multiplayer\n- Online Co-Op\n- Prequel(s)\n- Grounded\n- Number of Players\n- Single-player",
