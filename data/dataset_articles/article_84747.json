  "text": "Gold from Waste - What Revolutionary Discovery Scientists Made.\ntoday, 06:20\n68\nJournalist\nShostal Oleksandr\ntoday, 06:20\n68\nScientists have developed a new method for extracting gold from electronic waste that is efficient and safe. They used proteins that form amyloid fibrils when heated, which help separate gold from other metals.\nResearch and Gold Extraction Process\nProtein fibrils are converted into aerogel, which is used for gold extraction. Experiments have shown that this method can yield almost 91% pure gold with a content of nearly 22 carats.\nScientists believe that this new method could be an important step towards the ecological recycling of electronic waste and reducing the negative impact on the environment.\nThe presented text describes a new method for extracting gold from electronic waste that is more efficient and safer than previous methods. This method could contribute to more eco-friendly recycling of electronic waste and a reduction in harmful effects on the environment.Read also",
