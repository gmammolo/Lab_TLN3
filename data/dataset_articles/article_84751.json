  "text": "Ad Disclosure\nSouth Korea’s central bank is stepping up its game in the crypto world. Based on reports, the Bank of Korea (BOK) has created a new “digital currency lab” unit under its Financial Settlement Bureau.\nThe new department will keep an eye on digital tokens, especially won‑pegged stablecoins and related rules. At the same time, the bank is renaming its Digital Currency Research Lab to the Digital Currency Lab on July 31, 2025, and shuffling staff to run token tests.\nCrypto Assets Arm Takes Shape\nAccording to reports, the new division will track price moves, market trends and legal shifts. It sits alongside existing teams in the Financial Settlement Bureau.\nStaffers will test how tokens work in payments and settlements. They will also study any spillover into regular bank accounts and lending. The goal is to spot risks early and offer clear advice to policy makers.\nSource: VTT Studio/Adobe\nPrivate Stablecoin Bills Gain Traction\nThe bank’s move comes just hours after the nation’s two biggest political parties introduced stablecoin bills. Each bill would give the Financial Services Commission broad power to license and supervise issuers.\nLawmakers say this will protect consumers and boost innovation. Opponents fear it could weaken the BOK’s grip on monetary tools.\nBased on reports, some critics warn that letting private stablecoins circulate freely might interfere with interest‑rate decisions.\nCentral Bank Pauses CBDC Rollout\nIn late June, the BOK hit pause on its central bank digital currency (CBDC) rollout, known as Project Han River. According to Governor Rhee Chang‑yong, banks’ deposit tokens look a lot like stablecoins.\nHe said that “no matter if we are talking about a won stablecoin or a deposit token, we will need a digital currency in the future.”\nThe governor added that the bank will weigh a bank‑led launch against a wider private‑sector model. The BOK plans to focus on bank support first, then consider opening up to fintech firms.\nTech Giants Eye Stablecoin Market\nSome of South Korea’s top tech firms have already filed trademarks for won‑pegged coins. They appear to be waiting for lawmakers to give them the green light. If the bills pass, big names in e‑commerce and messaging could launch their own tokens.\nThat would create new payment channels and loyalty programs. It could also shift some deposits out of traditional banks, a concern the BOK has flagged.\nDeputy Governor Ryoo Sang‑dai has stressed a cautious approach. He said the bank will roll out digital tokens in stages, starting with commercial banks. The cryptocurrency department will play a key role in shaping that plan.\nFeatured image from Meta, chart from TradingView",
