  "text": "A recent report highlights various pharmacist-led initiatives aimed at improving medication safety and reducing adverse drug events (ADEs) across healthcare institutions. Pharmacists from different organizations shared their strategies, detailing unique approaches tailored to their specific settings. These efforts focus on enhancing patient care by minimizing risks associated with medication errors.\nThe initiatives described include measures such as implementing advanced medication reconciliation processes, utilizing technology to flag potential drug interactions, and conducting thorough reviews of prescriptions for accuracy. Some institutions have adopted educational programs to inform patients about proper medication use, while others emphasize interprofessional collaboration between pharmacists and other healthcare providers to ensure comprehensive oversight of treatment plans. These approaches reflect a growing emphasis on the role of pharmacists in promoting safer practices within the healthcare system.\nNewsflash | Powered by GeneOnline AI\nSource: GO-AI-ne1\nDate: July 30, 2025",
