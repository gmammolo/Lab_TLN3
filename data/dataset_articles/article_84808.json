  "text": "Biotech Redefining Sustainability and Investment in Agriculture\nSTORY INLINE POST\nWhen we think about the future of farming, the usual image is automation: robots in the field, drones overhead, AI dashboards. But some of the most important changes in agriculture today are happening underground. Biotech is quietly transforming how we grow food — and it’s no longer something reserved for Silicon Valley labs or massive US operations. It’s taking root here in Latin America, with real impact and real investment behind it.\nIn Mexico, companies like Vexxel and Alibio are already pushing this frontier. They’re engineering microbial blends and natural bio-inputs that help crops thrive with fewer chemicals. The results? Healthier soils, stronger harvests, and better long-term margins for farmers. And it’s not just about being “green.” These solutions are delivering performance in tough conditions — drought, soil degradation, disease pressure. It’s where resilience meets profitability.\nFurther south, Argentine-born Puna.bio recently raised funding from the Gates Foundation, At One Ventures, and SP Ventures. They work with extremophile microbes — organisms that survive in the world’s harshest climates — to develop seed coatings that improve crop yields even in depleted soils. Early trials show 10–15% yield improvements. That kind of lift can be the difference between profit and loss for small and midsize producers.\nGlobally, the agricultural biotech market was valued at approximately US$115 billion in 2022 and is projected to exceed US$200 billion by 2030. The fastest-growing segments include biofertilizers, biopesticides, microbial seed treatments, and gene editing technologies like CRISPR. Microbial innovations, in particular, are gaining traction because they offer scalable, cost-effective ways to reduce synthetic input dependence and improve nutrient cycling, which is critical for aging soils and overworked land.\nAt the same time, consumer preferences are evolving fast. Today, nearly 100 million hectares are certified organic globally. In the United States, organic food sales recently topped US$50 billion, with growth continuing in double digits. Consumers are no longer just looking for “cheap,” they’re asking how their food was grown. Biotech is stepping in to help producers answer that question with cleaner, traceable systems.\nOne common misconception is that “going organic” or regenerative always means giving up yield or increasing cost. While organic systems can produce slightly less, they often outperform conventional systems in net profitability thanks to premium pricing and lower synthetic input costs. Biotech is accelerating this shift by closing the productivity gap and making regenerative practices more accessible, even to small-scale farmers.\nInvestors are following the science. Over the past decade, more than US$200 billion has been invested globally in agtech, with biotech now accounting for a growing share. In 2023 alone, private equity and venture capital funds poured over US$10 billion into ag-biotech startups. There’s been a 3x increase in average round size for companies working on soil health, natural inputs, and crop resilience compared to just five years ago. What has changed is that investors are no longer just betting on moonshots. They want proof of performance in the field — and companies like Vexxel, Alibio, and Puna.bio are delivering it.\nFor Mexico, this is a real moment to lead. We have the farmers, the biotech talent, and a growing urgency to build sustainable systems that can feed both our population and the export market. But for this to scale, we need more than innovation. We need smarter regulation, financing mechanisms that support adoption, and investment in infrastructure that connects lab results to the field.\nThe future of agriculture won’t just be digitized, it will be biologically driven. And for countries like Mexico, this is more than a chance to catch up. It’s a chance to lead.",
