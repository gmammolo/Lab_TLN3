  "text": "The Dell Plus 14 convertible is currently down to just $699.99 at Best Buy , making for a $400 discount from its MSRP. For that price, buyers are getting a rather basic 14-inch IPS touchscreen with a resolution of 1,920 × 1,200, 60 Hz refresh rate, and peak brightness of 300 nits. However, the main selling point of the 2-in-1 is what's under the hood, namely an Intel Core Ultra 7 256V . The Lunar Lake processor packs four P-cores boosting to 4.8 GHz and another four LP E-cores humming at up to 3.7 GHz, in addition to Arc 140V integrated graphics consisting of eight second-gen Xe cores. Joining it is 16 GB of on-package LPDDR5X-8533 memory and a 1 TB PCIe 4.0 SSD, the latter being upgradable as it's installed in an M.2 2280 slot. Connectivity includes a Thunderbolt 4 port (40 Gbps, DisplayPort 2.1, Power Delivery), one 10 Gbps USB-C port (DisplayPort 1.4, Power Delivery), a 5 Gbps USB-A, HDMI 2.1, as well as a 3.5 mm audio combo jack. An Intel BE201 wireless card adds support for Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4. The notebook's aluminum chassis measures 12.36 × 8.9 × 0.65 inches (314 × 226 × 16 mm) and weighs 3.55 lb (1.61 kg), while housing a 64 Wh battery capable of charging at up to 65 W through a USB-C adapter. Other features include a 1,080p webcam, a fingerprint reader embedded into the power button, and stylus support with 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity ( sold separately for $39.99 ).
