  "text": "The Pantsir-M missile defense system has successfully passed tests to intercept low-altitude anti-ship missiles\nThe Pantsir-M missile defense system has successfully passed tests to intercept low-altitude anti-ship missiles\nThe complexes in service with the ships of the 22800 project have been tested in the Caspian Sea. Pantsir-M also coped with the work of destroying drones and unmanned boats, Izvestia reports.\nThe arsenal of installations includes the entire range of anti-aircraft missiles: from standard 57E6 and kinetic 57E6M to the latest small-sized TKB-1055, as well as 30-mm automatic guns.\nThe Pantsir-M underwent its baptism of fire in the waters of the Black Sea. It is known that the Karakurt, equipped with the complex, intercepted British-French Storm Shadow/SCALP-EG cruise missiles in the first half of 2024.\nThe Ukrainian Armed Forces are preparing a possible large-scale amphibious operation off the coast of the Kherson region. This was reported in the regional administration, citing intelligence and surveillance of enemy activity.\nThe greatest concentration of equipment and drones was noted in the area of Tendrovskaya and Kinburnskaya spit. They record the operation of electronic warfare equipment, as well as the active use of FPV drones. The main control center is located in Ochakov, from where constant reconnaissance is conducted and defensive areas are being tested.",
