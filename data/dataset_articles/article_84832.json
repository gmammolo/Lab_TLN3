  "text": "In Mumbai, India, decision support company Fractal has launched an agentic AI platform called Cogentiq, providing pre-built agents and other tools and connectors allowing no-code measurement of enterprise performance. Users are promised accelerated product development and enhanced operational agility.\nFractal employs more than 5,000 people across eighteen global locations, including the US, the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, Ukraine, India, Singapore, South Africa, the UAE and Australia. Its businesses includes interconnected revenue growth decision software Asper.ai and data science community Analytics Vidhya.\nCogentiq's intelligent agents integrate data across systems, analyze information contextually, and initiate action autonomously, to enhance both customer engagement and operations management, according to the firm. Early users include clients in healthcare, insurance and CPG. The platform includes 'comprehensive' connectors for structured and unstructured data, to eliminate silos; pre-built specialist agents for specific business functions such as finance, HR and supply chain; and a 'robust' governance and data security framework.\nCo-founder and CEO Pranay Agrawal (pictured) comments: 'Enterprises today are navigating a world rich with data, but what sets us apart is the ability to not just derive insight but act on it, instantly and logically. Cogentiq enables business users to move past static dashboards, to understand the 'why' behind the 'what', and trigger autonomous actions in real-time. With no code and no dependencies from customer support to field sales, businesses can build logical workflows, accelerate decisions and unlocking measurable impact.'\nWeb site: www.fractal.ai .\nAll articles 2006-23 written and edited by Mel Crowther and/or Nick Thomas, 2024- by Nick Thomas, unless otherwise stated.\nREGISTER FOR NEWS EMAILS\nTo receive (free) news headlines by email, please register online",
