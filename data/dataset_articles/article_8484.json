  "text": "UAE Allocates $5Mln in Humanitarian Aid to Sudan, UAE Foreign Ministry Says Subscribe MOSCOW (Sputnik) - In April, at the International Humanitarian Conference for Sudan and Neighbouring Countries, the UAE committed to providing $100 million to Sudan via UN agencies. Last week, the UAE Foreign Ministry said that 70% of the pledged sum had been allocated. \"The United Arab Emirates has signed an agreement with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to allocate USD 5 million to support the Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SHF),\" the ministry said in a statement on Friday. The UN undersecretary for humanitarian affairs, Martin Griffiths, was quoted as saying that \"with this allocation, we can bolster our [lifesaving support](https://en.sputniknews.africa/20240618/blinken-saudi-foreign-minister-discuss-action-to-end-sudan-war-us-state-department-says-1067092880.html)to families and communities caught up in Sudan's unprecedented humanitarian crisis.\" On April 15, 2023, clashes broke out between the Sudanese army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The parties to the conflict have since introduced a number of temporary nationwide ceasefires, but none has helped settle the conflict.",
