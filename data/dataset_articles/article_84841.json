  "text": "FLINT — Hurley Medical Center staff call the addition of two revolutionary robotic-assisted technologies—the ION Endoluminal System and the da Vinci 5 Surgical System—real game changers in the fight against lung cancer.\nThis new technology has positioned Hurley as the only hospital in the region to offer both of these state-of-the-art platforms, according to Hurley officials.\nThis significant advancement brings world-class, minimally invasive surgical care closer to home, eliminating the need for patients to travel to Detroit or Ann Arbor for leading-edge procedures.\nION Endoluminal System: “A Breakthrough in Lung Cancer Diagnostics.”\nThe ION Endoluminal System represents the next frontier in robotic-assisted lung cancer diagnostics. Specifically designed to navigate the complexities of the lung, the ION system enables physicians to obtain tissue samples from deep within the lung with remarkable accuracy.\n• Ultra-thin, maneuverable catheter allows access to hard-to-reach areas of the lung.\n• Unmatched stability and precision significantly outperform traditional manual biopsy techniques.\n• Dual-lung visualization in a single procedure improves efficiency.\n• Early detection of even the smallest tumors enhances outcomes and reduces risk.\n• Lower complication rates, including reduced risk of lung collapse.\n“This groundbreaking tool provides physicians with a safer, more efficient way to diagnose lung cancer earlier, ultimately improving survival rates and patient care,” said Rick Barker, director of respiratory & neurology services. da Vinci 5: Elevating Minimally Invasive Surgery Hurley also welcomes the da Vinci 5 Surgical System—its second da Vinci robot—to its surgical suite. This fifth-generation platform enhances the capabilities of surgeons through high-definition, 3D magnified visualization and unmatched precision.\n• Enhanced precision and dexterity with robotic arms that mimic, and even surpass, the flexibility of the human hand.\n• Minimally invasive techniques result in smaller incisions, less scarring, and quicker recovery.\n• Reduced post-operative pain and shorter hospital stays for many patients.\n• Improved surgical outcomes due to advanced control and visualization.\nThe da Vinci 5 serves as an advanced tool in the hands of skilled surgeons, enabling more complex procedures with better outcomes for patients.\n“At Hurley Medical Center, we are committed to delivering the highest standard of care,” said John Stewart, service line administrator at Hurley. “Bringing both the ION and da Vinci 5 systems to our community exemplifies our mission to provide cutting-edge technology and expertise right here in Flint.”\nWith these innovative platforms now available, Hurley continues to lead the way in minimally invasive, robotic-assisted care—enhancing outcomes, reducing recovery times, and expanding access to the most advanced surgical technologies in the region.\nAs part of our Employee Appreciation Week, Hurley is proud to host the Intuitive Thoracic Oncology Mobile Unit, showcasing the two revolutionary technologies now available at our hospital: the ION and the da Vinci 5 robotic systems.",
