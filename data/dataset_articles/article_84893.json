  "text": "Micron Surges 2.48% on $1.87B Volume to 37th U.S. Liquidity Rank as Analysts Hike Price Targets to $165 and Institutional Buyers Pile In\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) rose 2.48% on July 30, 2025, with a trading volume of $1.87 billion, ranking 37th among U.S. stocks by liquidity. The move followed a surge in analyst optimism, with price targets raised across multiple firms, ranging from $140 to $165, reflecting confidence in the company’s recent earnings performance and strategic positioning in the semiconductor sector.\nParnassus Value Equity Fund highlighted Micron as a key holding in its Q2 2025 investor letter, citing its role in the firm’s concentrated portfolio of large-cap U.S. stocks. The fund outperformed its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Value Index, with a 7.24% return for the quarter. Institutional investor activity further underscored Micron’s appeal, as holdings by entities like CIBC Private Wealth Group and Janus Henderson Group increased significantly in Q4 2024, with the latter adding 1.13 million shares valued at $113 million.\nTechnical and fundamental indicators aligned to support the stock’s recent momentum. Micron’s Q3 2025 earnings of $1.91 per share exceeded analyst estimates by 21%, while revenue reached $9.3 billion, outpacing expectations. Analysts from Piper Sandler, Cantor Fitzgerald, and TD Cowen upgraded their price targets, with Piper Sandler setting a new $165 target—a 46% increase from its prior level. Despite short-term technical headwinds, including a 3.84% dip in the prior week, the stock’s strong cash flow and gross profit margins signaled resilience amid sector volatility.\nThe strategy of purchasing the top 500 stocks by daily trading volume and holding them for one day generated a 166.71% return from 2022 to 2025, outperforming the benchmark by 137.53 percentage points. This approach demonstrated a 31.89% compound annual growth rate, highlighting the effectiveness of capitalizing on high-liquidity stocks and short-term market sentiment shifts.\nComments\nNo comments yet",
