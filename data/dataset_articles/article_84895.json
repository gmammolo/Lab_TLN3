  "text": "TrendForce News operates independently from our research team, curating key semiconductor and tech updates to support timely, informed decisions.\nAs HBM competition heats up, the world’s top three memory giants—SK hynix, Samsung, and Micron—will share the stage in Taiwan for the first time this September at the Memory Executive Summit during SEMICON Taiwan 2025, according to Commercial Times and Knews.\nAs per SEMICON Taiwan, the summit—schedule on September 9th under the theme “Empowering AI: Exploring the Possibilities of Memory Innovation”—will highlight breakthroughs and challenges in AI memory, from co-designing chips to advanced packaging and full value chain collaboration.\nSK hynix’s Young HBM Leader Steps into the Spotlight\nNotably, Jeff (Joonyong) Choi, VP of SK hynix, will discuss key AI-era memory trends and how partnerships are reshaping standards for HBM and AI computing infrastructure.\nAppointed as the youngest-ever head of HBM Business Planning, Choi, in his early 40s, aims to cement SK hynix’s leadership in 2025 by mass-producing 12-layer HBM4 and delivering HBM4E on schedule to meet demand, according to SK hynix. In March, the company has shipped the samples of 12-layer HBM4 to major customers for the first time in the world.\nSamsung and Micron Leaders to Share Next-Gen Memory Visions\nOn the other hand, Jangseok Choi, VP of Memory Product Planning of Samsung Electronics, will speak on how next-generation memory innovations are driving AI performance gains and shaping the diverse evolution of memory technologies. As per SEMICON, Choi is a seasoned expert in memory technologies who has led advancements in open standards through collaborations with organizations like JEDEC.\nChoi has been a key voice on Samsung’s next-gen memory roadmap, including CXL (Compute Express Link)—a high-speed interface connecting CPUs, GPUs, and memory in advanced computing. As reported by the Korea Economic Daily, Samsung has spent over a decade developing high-quality CXL and aimed to mass-produce 256GB DRAM with CXL 2.0 by late 2024. Choi, cited by the report, expects the CXL market to surge by 2028.\nMeanwhile, Micron’s Nirmal Ramaswamy, Corporate VP of DRAM Technology Development, will also participate at the summit, as he shares how the company advances AI with breakthrough DRAM, spotlighting the global memory industry’s diverse innovation paths.\nAccording to SEMICON Taiwan, Ramaswamy joined Micron in 2002 and has served in various leading roles in process development, process integration and technology development in DRAM, NAND and Emerging Memories. He holds more than 300 issued patents in the field of semiconductors.\nNotably, in 2023, EE News Europe revealed that Micron has developed what it calls the world’s first dual-layer, 32Gbit stackable ferroelectric memory technology, dubbed NVDRAM (Non-Volatile Dynamic Random Access Memory), with Ramaswamy being the lead author.\n(Photo credit: SK hynix)",
