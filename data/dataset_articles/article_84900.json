  "text": "Trusted websites\nThe History of AI – Part 2: Singapore’s AI Journey\n31 July 2025\nWhat key steps has Singapore taken to lead in AI innovation and build a Smart Nation? Discover Singapore's past and present AI initiatives shaping our digital society in Part 2 of this 2-part series.\nAfter tracing AI’s remarkable global evolution in Part 1: The History of AI, we now turn our focus to Singapore — where we’ve not only kept pace with these global breakthroughs but also charted our own bold path in the AI era.\nThis is Part 2 of a 2-part series on the history of AI.\nIn Part 2, we’ll explore key developments in the last decade, focusing on:\nSingapore’s early digital foundations\nThe National AI Strategy 2.0 and Smart Nation 2.0\nSingapore’s early digital foundations\n1981: Formation of the National Computer Board (NCB)\nThe NCB was established in 1981 to spearhead Singapore's computerisation efforts. This initiative was prompted by a 1980 study led by Dr. Tony Tan, then Minister of Education, which highlighted the need for a dedicated body to oversee the country's digital transformation.\n1992: IT2000 Masterplan\nThe IT2000 Masterplan was a government initiative launched in 1992 with the goal of turning Singapore into a technologically advanced nation. The plan aimed to harness the power of information technology (IT) to boost economic growth and improve the overall quality of life for its citizens.\n1997: Singapore ONE network launched\nThe Singapore ONE (Online Network Exchange) network was the nationwide broadband network which provided widespread internet access, offering high-speed connections to homes and businesses across the nation, solidifying Singapore's position as a technological pioneer.\n2014: Smart Nation 1.0 announced by former PM Lee\nSmart Nation 1.0 is a national initiative launched by the Singapore government in 2014 to harness technology to improve the lives of its citizens. The goal is to create a more efficient, convenient, and sustainable society.\n2016: Formation of IMDA and GovTech in Singapore\nIn 2016, Singapore's digital landscape underwent a significant transformation with the merger of two key government agencies: the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) and the Media Development Authority (MDA). This merger gave rise to the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), a unified entity tasked with driving the nation's digital agenda.\nTo further accelerate Singapore's digital journey, the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) was established. GovTech was designed to spearhead the development and implementation of innovative digital solutions for the government, citizens, and businesses. Find out more about GovTech’s story\nThe National AI Strategy 2.0 and Smart Nation 2.0\nAs AI matured globally, Singapore took decisive steps to harness its potential. Singapore’s National AI Strategy 2.0 (NAIS 2.0) reflects the nation’s bold commitment to harnessing AI as a transformative force for the public good, both locally and globally. Building on the foundations of its first AI strategy, NAIS 2.0 envisions Singapore as a hub where AI is not only a driver of innovation but also a tool to uplift and empower its people and businesses.\nThe overarching goal is clear: To master AI as an indispensable necessity for the nation's continued prosperity and to leverage it responsibly for the benefit of Singapore.\nTo advance this goal, the government has already committed investments in AI Research and Development. For instance, more than S$500 million is committed through AI Singapore (AISG) under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2020 and 2025 plans.\nMoreover, there is also a plethora of government initiatives to aid individuals, businesses, and startups to leverage AI to stay relevant in today’s increasingly tech-enabled environment.\nHere are some of them:\nLearnAI with AI Singapore\nAI Singapore aims to grow local talent and expertise in AI, thereby strengthening national capabilities in this space. Hence, it offers courses for students, educators and professionals of all ages to learn AI-related skills.\nIMDA’s TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA)\nTeSA equips Singapore's workforce with in-demand ICT skills for the digital economy. Partnering with industries and agencies, TeSA supports career growth through practitioner training, bridging talent to opportunities in tech.\nSkillsFuture for Digital Workplace\nThe SkillsFuture for Digital Workplace (SFDW) 2.0 equips adults with digital literacy for the digital economy. Tailored for key sectors, it fosters skills in data analytics, and digital tools, helping employees adapt to tech-driven workplaces and future opportunities.\nFor a more comprehensive list of programmes, check out Smart Nation Singapore’s curated list.\nPM Lawrence Wong unveils refreshed Smart Nation 2.0 blueprint in 2024\nSmart Nation 2.0 is the next phase of Singapore's national initiative to harness technology to improve the lives of its citizens. It builds upon the successes of Smart Nation 1.0 and aims to address emerging challenges and opportunities in the digital age.\nThe 3 key goals of Smart Nation 2.0 are:\nTrust - Singaporeans should be able to confidently use digital tools, knowing their safety and privacy are protected and digital systems are reliable.\nGrowth - Technology must be leveraged to empower individuals and businesses to learn, adapt, and develop new skills.\nCommunity - Technology can unite communities and strengthen society. A Smart Nation should foster social cohesion without leaving anyone behind.\nUnder GovTech's leadership, AI is being used to deliver some of these Smart Nation 2.0 initiatives across platforms: leveraging the Scam Analytics and Tactical Intervention System (SATIS) to identify scam websites at scale, streamlining video analytics, and deploying AI-enabled productivity tools.\nThe result? Public officers now use chatbots like Pair to generate ideas or writing assistants like SmartCompose to compose messages, while digital platforms such as SG Tech Stack and GoBusiness gain AI-backed capabilities—from intelligent document parsing to chatbot-led advisory services—all designed to empower citizens, reduce manual work, and deliver smarter, more inclusive digital services aligned with the Smart Nation 2.0 ambition.\nPrompt engineering playbook\nTo help improve the engagement experience with chatbots, GovTech developed a Prompt Engineering playbook (available to the public too) that guides you on how to effectively interact with AI models like ChatGPT. Learn how to write effective prompts, explore advanced techniques, and discover practical examples to enhance your AI interactions. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, this playbook will empower you to harness the full potential of AI.\nEmbracing AI’s capabilities for the future\nWhile the rapid advancement of AI technology raises valid concerns about job displacement, it also presents significant opportunities for innovation and growth. By embracing AI and investing in continuous learning, we can adapt to the changing landscape and create a future where technology empowers humans rather than replaces them.\nSingapore's proactive approach, exemplified by initiatives like NAIS 2.0 and Smart Nation 2.0, demonstrates a commitment to harnessing AI for the benefit of society. As we navigate the complexities of the digital age, let us embrace change with optimism and work together to shape a future where technology and humanity coexist harmoniously.\nConnect with us!\nSubscribe to the TechNews email newsletter\nBack to top",
