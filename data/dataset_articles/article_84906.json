  "text": "TomTom will showcase just how far traffic and mapping technology has progressed. With a range of immersive product demonstrations and a strong line-up of expert speakers, the global mapmaker is poised to set a new standard for location-powered urban planning solutions.\nHighlighting high-impact partnerships from around the world, TomTom will show how its data and tools are helping solve real-world transport challenges. Chief among these are improving traffic flow and enhancing road safety. Organisations working with TomTom gain powerful insights through the mapmaker’s Traffic Index and Move Portal — a location analytics tool that offers both historical and real-time data. By predicting traffic patterns, technology partners such as Flow Labs are addressing mobility issues before they happen.\nOther organisations are using TomTom’s technology to improve emergency response times. Whether managing large-scale events — such as concerts or international sports tournaments — or determining optimal ambulance routes, insights derived from location data are making cities safer and more efficient, from Paris to Dubai.\nTomTom’s traffic insights also support urban planning and infrastructure decisions by helping cities optimise capacity, align with policies, and manage costs effectively. This plays a crucial role in preparing cities for future challenges such as population growth, climate adaptation, and emerging mobility trends.\nVisitors can also experience TomTom Orbis Maps, a next-generation mapmaking platform offering richer datasets, deeper insights, and more ways to shape truly smarter cities.\nStand 831",
