  "text": "Game On! Headspace Invaders Turns Retro Arcade Style Into Platform Against Online Harm\nHeadspace Invaders is a new interactive platform that helps 12–16-year-olds build online resilience, critical thinking, and the confidence to respond early when they see something that feels wrong or manipulative online. The platform has been launched today in Wellington, at an event opened by the Minister of Internal Affairs, Brooke van Velden.\nDesigned by Netsafe, with input from young people, educators, Youthline, and subject matter experts, the free platform features three fast-paced, gamified modules that echo the look and feel of 80s arcade game, Space Invaders. Each section includes games, videos, and realistic examples designed to support young people to notice emotional manipulation and polarising content; reflect critically before reacting or engaging; respond safely and support others when harm begins to appear and recognise that early action can help prevent escalation. Additional resources enable teachers to use the platform in the classroom, and parents to have conversations at home.\nChief Customer Officer for Netsafe, Leanne Ross, said young people are exposed to emotionally charged, polarising, or pressuring content online. Examples include viral misinformation and emotionally charged posts, identity-based slurs, memes, or humour that normalise exclusion, polarising narratives or secretive groups promoting “us versus them” thinking and signs of extremist influence, especially in especially in social feeds led by algorithms, chat and gaming spaces.\n“Many say they want help understanding what they’re seeing and how to respond safely. Headspace Invaders fills a gap between basic digital safety and more advanced intervention tools. It focuses on the moments where confusion, pressure, or manipulation starts to take hold, well before someone might become involved in serious harm,” said Ross.\nThis is one of the first youth-facing tools in New Zealand to explore online extremism, identity-based harm, and misinformation from a youth-led educational prevention lens. “It reflects growing concern from schools, whānau, and frontline services about online content that isolates, manipulates, or gradually shifts young people’s beliefs and behaviours. The platform is accompanied by teacher and parent guides, and grounded in prevention, not fear,” said Ross.\nHeadspace Invaders was co-designed with 13 to 15-year-olds, including a dedicated Youth Co-Design Team and support from Netsafe’s Youth Action Squad. Youthline contributed sector research and developed the platform’s written content, ensuring that every section is evidence-informed, inclusive, and grounded in youth wellbeing. The process was guided by an academic steering group and informed by subject matter experts from across the prevention and countering violent extremism (PCVE) sector.\nDistinguished Professor Emeritus Paul Spoonley (MA MSc PhD ONZM FRSNZ), Honorary Research Associate at Te Kura Pukenga Tangata / College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Massey University was one of the steering group members.\n“All the evidence indicates that early interventions are the most effective – and none more so than when it comes to online safety and appropriate behaviour – and that co-design with young New Zealanders is critical if these interventions and guidelines are going to work,” said Spoonley.\nDr Philippa Smith, an expert in digital media literacy and online harms, provided research-based advice during the development of Headspace Invaders and was also on the steering group.\n“The more we can strengthen young people’s media literacy skills, so they can critically assess what is credible versus what is false, manipulative or harmful, the more we equip them to participate safely and confidently in digital life. This resource empowers young people to navigate a minefield of negative online behaviours,” said Dr Smith.\nThe platform is made up of three self-guided interactive modules:\n1. Misinformation and Disinformation: how false or manipulated content spreads and why people fall for it\n2. Harmful Online Behaviour: how online comments, jokes or patterns can become isolating, harmful, or prejudice-based\n3. Online Extremism: how extremist thinking often begins subtly, and how to recognise early warning signs\nExplore, a national provider of Mental Health and Wellbeing Services and part of New Zealand Health Group, partnered with Netsafe for the launch as part of their collaborative work under the Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism (PCVE) Fund. Alongside the Headspace Invaders platform, they launched educator and front-line training on recognising and responding to online extremism at today’s event. This is the second year Netsafe and Explore have worked together.\nExplore’s NZ Health Group Director of Disability, Amanda Bleckmann, said the organisation is proud to launch PCVE Positive Online Interventions at the event today. This is a suite of eLearning modules designed to reduce the risk of radicalisation by equipping frontline professionals with the tools to engage early, safely, and effectively. “This initiative is the result of a powerful and enduring collaboration across government agencies. We have worked closely with international experts, including the Violence Prevention Network, and with our workforce development partner MySkill. Most importantly, we’ve drawn on the wisdom of cultural and community leaders, because context and connection are key to making this work effective and safe,” she said.\nHeadspace Invaders is now ready for use in classrooms and communities. We invite you to share it with educators and youth networks.\nThe platform can be found at https://netsafe.org.nz/headspace-invaders",
