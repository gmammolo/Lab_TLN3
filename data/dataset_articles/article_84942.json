  "text": "If you’re pressed for time, can’t cook, or want a sous chef that doesn’t bite back, the world’s smallest, smartest kitchen might just be your next culinary bestie. Meet the TM7, Thermomix’s shiny new all-in-one kitchen device.\nPhotograph: Thermomix But forget admiring it online – you can now experience the TM7 in the flesh at Thermomix’s first experience store in Singapore. You’ll find it on the second floor (#02-07/08) of the newly revamped The Cathay – a bright, open space with floor-to-ceiling windows, cooking stations, and a neat layout that makes exploring a breeze.\nWe popped in for a live demo and got a proper look at what the TM7 can do. It’s sleeker and quieter than the previous model, with a bigger, more responsive multi-touch display. It connects directly to Cookidoo, Thermomix’s recipe platform, giving you access to over 100,000 guided recipes right from the screen – think smartphone, but for your kitchen.\nPhotograph: Thermomix What really impressed us? It replaces over 20 kitchen appliances, saving you both space and money. Plus, with its multi-layer cooking function, you can prepare entire meals – like soup, rice, and a meat dish – at the same time. The stainless steel bowl even has an integrated heating system, temperature sensors and an insulation cover so it stays cool to the touch, even when its contents are piping hot.\nIn under two hours, we whipped up fresh lemonade and mango sorbet in less than three minutes, followed by hot mushroom soup and stir-fried veggies in under 10. We even baked homemade focaccia with a little help from the oven. The TM7 crushed ice, squeezed lemons, browned vegetables, kneaded dough and even cleaned itself, leaving us free to set the table.\nPhotograph: Thermomix With Guided Cooking, the TM7 walks you through every step of a recipe – so even if you’ve never cooked before, it’s almost impossible to mess up. For experienced cooks, it’s a chance to explore new techniques and tackle recipes you might not have tried otherwise. It’s a total game-changer for time-starved working professionals, busy parents juggling dinner and homework, or anyone who just wants to put a wholesome meal on the table without the stress.\nCan’t wait to get your hands on the TM7? You can get yours now for $2,980, including free shipping to your doorstep.\nPhotograph: Thermomix But if you prefer to try before you buy, the Thermomix experience store also hosts thematic cooking classes. Each two-hour session offers hands-on experience with the TM7, plus useful tips and tricks that go beyond the manual. The best part? They’re all free. Just book in advance here as slots are limited and fill up fast. It’s the best way to see the TM7 in action before making it part of your kitchen routine. Discover more here .",
