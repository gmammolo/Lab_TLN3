  "text": "At the 2025 South by Southwest (SXSW) festival, Bruce Vaughn, Chief Creative Officer of Walt Disney Imagineering, unveiled an exciting new initiative that merges Disney’s digital and physical entertainment worlds. He teased a groundbreaking development, stating, “We are gonna have an opportunity for certain Guests to bridge those worlds, and share those worlds, and have a relationship between that.”\nCredit: Epic Games/ Disney Disney’s Vision for an Interconnected Universe The key news here is Disney’s plan to connect its expanding Fortnite universe with the immersive experiences of Disney Parks. This initiative is part of Disney’s $1.5 billion investment in Epic Games, the creators of Fortnite , which was announced in February 2024. Through this collaboration, Disney aims to create a persistent, open, and interoperable entertainment universe where beloved Disney franchises—such as Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and Avatar—are integrated within the Fortnite platform. This will give fans the chance to play, watch, shop, and engage with Disney content in new and innovative ways across both the digital and physical worlds.\nVaughn and other Disney executives at SXSW discussed how this merger could enrich guest experiences. Imagineers are exploring how in-game missions could affect real-world narratives within the parks. For example, actions taken in Fortnite could influence storylines and experiences in Disney attractions , blending the virtual world with the real one. The aim is to create a cohesive ecosystem where guests can enjoy a more immersive and interactive Disney experience , seamlessly shifting between the game and the park.\nBruce Vaughn teases Disney and Fortnite’s entertainment universe connecting to Disney Parks:\n“We are gonna have an opportunity for certain Guests to bridge those worlds, and share those worlds, and have a relationship between that.”\n— Drew Smith (@DrewDisneyDude) July 29, 2025\nWhat This Means for Disney Parks The integration is more than just a way to add digital features to physical spaces. Disney’s goal is to foster a deeper connection between the two realms. For instance, completing a mission in Fortnite could unlock exclusive content, rewards, or experiences in the parks, encouraging fans to engage with both platforms simultaneously. This cross-platform approach creates a rich, interactive environment where stories continue beyond the screen and into real-life attractions.\nCredit: Epic Games While specific details and timelines remain unclear, the collaboration between Disney and Epic Games signals a shift in the future of storytelling. Disney is pushing the boundaries of how guests interact with its intellectual properties, allowing for dynamic and engaging experiences that evolve across platforms.\nAs Disney continues to expand this interconnected universe, it paves the way for future innovations that will merge digital gaming with physical attractions. This ambitious vision could set a new standard for interactive entertainment, where the lines between virtual and real experiences are beautifully blurred. The future of storytelling has arrived, and it looks like it will be more immersive and interconnected than ever before.",
