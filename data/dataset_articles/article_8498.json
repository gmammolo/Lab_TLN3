  "text": "The Hungary Helps Programme is extending emergency aid to civilians wounded in an explosion of an ammunition depo in N’Djamena in Chad, and to the capital city’s central hospital, it was announced on the programme’s Facebook page on Friday. In the aftermath of the ammunition depo fire that killed nine and injured another 46 people, Hungary Helps has launched a complex humanitarian aid scheme. As a first step, staff from the Hungary Helps Agency’s office in Chad and the Hungarian embassy’s head of mission visited the central hospital and granted 35 boxes of medicine compiled on the basis of the hospital director’s request. The Hungarian government opened a complex humanitarian and development centre in the capital of Chad in January this year with the aim to strengthen the stability of the Sahel.
