  "text": "LNG Alliance has named the contractor for its Amigo LNG project in Mexico , selecting Chart Industries to build the 7.8mn tonnes per year (tpy) facility, the contractor announced on July 11 .\nThe project, which is situated on a 150-acre site in the port city of Guaymas in Mexico’s northwestern state of Sonora , giving the export terminal an ideal location for exporting to Asian markets. The facility will consist of an initial 3.9mn tpy liquefaction unit, with the potential for expansion of a second unit of the same size.\nThe facility will have deepwater access giving it the capability to berth all types of LNG tankers, including the biggest Q-Max class of 265,000 cubic metres capacity.\nChart Industries will utilise its proprietary integrated pre-cooled single mixed refrigerant process technology. Its modular liquefaction solution for the construction of the terminal will include the use Mega Bay air-cooled heat exchangers, brazed aluminium heat exchangers and cold boxes, Tuf-Lite IV fans, and process vessels. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n“LNG Alliance is strategically optimising an LNG facility with an export capacity of 7.8 million tonnes per annum by moving to a modular mid-scale solution, resulting in a smaller footprint, higher efficiency and lower cost, therefore offering customers the most efficient and effective solution,” LNG Alliance chief executive Muthu Chezhian said in a statement.\nThe facility will source its feed gas from the Permian basin in west Texas and southeastern New Mexico via existing pipeline infrastructure.\nSince the project draws feed gas from the US, an export permit to ship to countries without a Free Trade Agreement with the US was needed from the US Department of Energy (DoE), which it has received.\nHowever, the permit expires at the end of 2027 and delays have pushed back the start of commercial operations until the second quarter of 2028. Consequently, Amigo LNG will need to secure an extension from the DOE or reapply for a permit.\nAmigo LNG has already inked LNG supply deals with Sahara Group and Oman’s OQ Trading .\n© 2025 bne IntelliNews, source Magazine\n© Acquiremedia - 2025",
