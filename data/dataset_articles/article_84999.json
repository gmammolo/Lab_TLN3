  "text": "Dr. Noah Marchese, owner of HealthChoice Center in Peachtree City, is offering a cutting-edge approach to treating soft tissues through the use of SoftWave therapy, a non-invasive treatment that utilizes acoustic sound waves to assist with the regeneration and healing of soft tissue.\nAccording to Dr. Marchese, this advanced technology is changing the outcome for patients throughout the natural healing process. Clinics, like HealthChoice, that have adopted this practice are reporting a reduction in pain, decreased inflammation, and increased range of motion, – providing relief and allowing the patient to return to their optimal function and getting back to their normal everyday activities.\nSoftWave therapy has shown positive results for musculoskeletal conditions such as arthritis, shoulder/ rotator cuff injuries, knee pain, peripheral neuropathy, plantar fasciitis, tennis/ golfers elbow, and tendonitis. At HealthChoice Center, Dr. Marchese has worked with many local student athletes as well as professional athletes who have suffered injuries that once sidelined them. Through the use of SoftWave, they have been able to return to their sports without the need for more invasive treatments or surgeries.\n“Recently, we had a local student who suffered from a rotary cuff injury while pitching early in the season. He went to a few doctors who told him he would be unable to pitch the entire year and may even need surgery to recover.” said Dr. Marchese. “ After not getting any results, he decided to come to our office and try softwave. We completed a few sessions of softwave around the entire rotator cuff and deltoid muscles of his pitching arm, and he was back to pitching better and faster than he was even previous to his injury.”\nIt’s also incredible to help treat the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. “ By its ability to reduce the inflammation and increase blood flow while regenerating nerves. We are just very excited to share this technology with the community and provide a place for people to come to help treat their chronic pain.” said Dr. Marchese.\nPatients interested in exploring this new therapy are first booked for a $49 mapping session, where Dr. Marchese evaluates the joints to locate the damaged or inflamed tissue. The mapping session also includes the first round of treatment.\nSoftWave can also be a cost-effective alternative to surgery, supporting long-term recovery by enhancing physical function and potentially lowering the overall cost of care.\nTo learn more or to schedule a consultation, call Dr. Noah Marchese’s practice, HealthChoice Center, at 770-408-0184, or visit the website at www.peachtreecitychiropractor.com.",
