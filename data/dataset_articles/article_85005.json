Revenue, excluding the impact of the Myanmar exit, increased by 4% YoY to QAR 11.9 billion with healthy net profit also rising by 4% YoY to QAR 1.9 billion.\nOur sustained growth across key financial metrics is a powerful testament to the clarity and strength of our business strategy. This success is anchored by our commitment to customer excellence, supported by a high-quality infrastructure and continuous strategic investment which are the core pillars of our current performance and future growth plans.\nIn the second half of the year, we will continue to advance our strategic priorities to become the leading digital infrastructure provider in the MENA region. Our approach is supported by strong financial discipline and a steadfast focus on delivering sustainable value to all our stakeholders.”\nAlso commenting on the results, Aziz Aluthman Fakhroo, CEO of Ooredoo Group, said:\n“The Group delivered a strong performance in the first half of the year, with year-on-year growth across Revenue, EBITDA and Net profit, reflecting the strength of our core operations and steady progress against our strategic priorities.\nExcluding the impact of the Myanmar exit, revenue increased by 4% YoY to QAR 11.9 billion and EBITDA grew by 3% to QAR 5.1 billion, maintaining a consistent EBITDA margin at 43%. Solid growth in Kuwait, Algeria, Iraq, Tunisia and Maldives were key drivers of Group performance. This healthy growth led to improved and sustainable profitability with net profit up by 4% to QAR 1.9 billion.\nWe are pleased with the progress made across a number of strategic initiatives in the first half; key highlights included the successful launch of our carrier-neutral data centre platform Syntys and our strategic partnership with Iron Mountain to accelerate platform scalability and enhance operational efficiency. Under our fintech vertical, we have gained strong traction since obtaining the Payment Service Provider licence in Oman a year ago, with sustained momentum reflected in a steady increase in user engagement.\nFollowing the reporting period and marking one year as an NVIDIA Cloud Partner, we expanded our data centre capabilities with the deployment of NVIDIA’s latest GPUs in our Qatar facilities. This milestone not only marks a first for the country but also underscores our commitment to becoming a regional leader in digital infrastructure.\nNone of these achievements would be possible without our people, as their commitment is the driving force behind Ooredoo Group’s success.\nLooking ahead to the second half of the year, we will maintain our disciplined execution while advancing our strategic priorities. From building essential digital infrastructure to advancing fintech innovation, Ooredoo Group remains committed to driving digital transformation across the MENA region.”\nStrategic review\nIn H1 2025, Ooredoo Group continued to execute against its long-term strategic goal of becoming a telecom and infrastructure powerhouse, anchored by five foundational pillars: delivering exceptional customer experience, empowering talent, driving smart telco innovation, strengthening core operations, and maintaining a disciplined, value-focused portfolio.\nWe are building a future-proof business by investing in five strategic verticals: telecom operations, towers, data centres, sea cable and fibre, and fintech; transforming into the region’s leading digital infrastructure provider, combining disciplined execution with strategic investments.\nOur balanced portfolio allows us to focus capital on high-value and high-growth areas that boost our financial performance and give us long-term sustainability.\nAs we look at the remainder of 2025 and beyond, Ooredoo is strategically positioned to lead the next wave of digital transformation across the region. Our multi-asset, infrastructure-driven model forms a robust foundation for long-term value creation, innovation, and meaningful regional impact. Through disciplined execution and strategic partnerships, we remain committed to unlocking the full potential of the digital economy for our customers, shareholders, and communities.\nTowerCo\nOoredoo Group, Zain Group, and TASC Towers Holding are advancing toward the creation of the region’s largest independent tower company, following the signing of definitive agreements in December 2023. The landmark transaction, a cash and share deal, will consolidate approximately 30,000 towers across six MENA markets under a single TowerCo.\nThe focus remains on closing procedures in each jurisdiction, with regulatory approvals serving as a key part of the process.\nOnce operational, the combined TowerCo is set to unlock scale capital and operational efficiencies and drive long-term value creation.\nData centres - Syntys\nSyntys, an independent entity strategically spun off from Ooredoo Group, is accelerating the development of AI-ready, hyperscale data centres across the MENA region operating in Qatar, Tunisia, Kuwait and with further regional expansion underway.\nTo accelerate platform scalability and enhance operational efficiency, Ooredoo Group entered a strategic partnership with Iron Mountain, a global leader in information management and data centre services, which acquired a minority equity stake in Syntys earlier this year. The partnership combines Ooredoo’s strong regional presence with Iron Mountain’s global expertise in hyperscale and AI-ready infrastructure, supporting the expansion of Syntys across key MENA markets.\nIn Q2 2025, Syntys played a pivotal role in enabling the launch of Ooredoo’s sovereign AI cloud services—now live and powered by NVIDIA’s latest GPUs. Hosted within Syntys owned and operated, sovereign digital infrastructure, the platform delivers high-performance, in-country compute capacity aligned with Qatar’s Digital Agenda 2030 and National AI Strategy. This launch further cements the company’s leadership in digital infrastructure, empowering AI clusters, national platforms, and driving large-scale digital transformation across the region.\nBacked by a planned USD 1 billion investment including initial funding of approximately USD 550 million—Syntys is rapidly expanding its data centre footprint across the MENA region. With 13 operational sites and one under construction, the company is targeting over 120 megawatts of data centre capacity over the medium to long term. Leveraging the clout of Ooredoo, the global expertise of Iron Mountain, and a seasoned leadership team, Syntys is consolidating its position to become a leading provider of high-performance digital infrastructure in the region—supporting the accelerating demand for cloud, AI, and sovereign solutions while cementing its role as a cornerstone of MENA’s digital economy.\nFintech\nOoredoo Financial Technology International (OFTI), established in 2023, continues to advance financial inclusion through mobile-led solutions. The company is now fully operational in Qatar, Oman and the Maldives with significant market share in the international remittances market processing over USD 6 billion in transactions and capturing a 21% market share in Qatar.\nIn Oman, one year after securing a Payment Service Provider licence and introducing ‘walletii by Ooredoo’, OFTI continued to scale its services in the market demonstrating strong growth momentum across core metrics including customer engagement, product adoption, and monetisation which, in turn, boosted user activity and ARPU through increased product usage and customer retention.\nOoredoo’s fintech venture continues to advance its expansion plans into Tunisia, Iraq, and Kuwait. Approval from regulator has already been granted in Tunisia, where implementation is progressing well, with strong stakeholder engagement and ecosystem expansion. In Iraq, market entry is accelerating with positive regulatory engagement, steady progress on incorporation activities, and strong collaboration with local partners. Proposition development is also advancing well, setting a strong foundation for a structured and scalable rollout.\nTo accelerate market expansion and enhance service offerings through our extensive network, OFTI has established strategic partnerships with Qatar’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry and global brands such as Western Union, PayPal, Visa, QNB, Thunes and MoneyGram.\nFintech remains a significant untapped opportunity in Ooredoo’s markets, with access to over 50 million customers on its network. With a vision to build an integrated digital marketplace, OFTI is well positioned to capitalise on the rapid growth of the MENA digital payments sector, driving long-term value through broader financial access and promoting digital inclusion.\nSea cable and Fibre\nOoredoo is advancing its strategic investment in subsea cable infrastructure to capture rising demand for high-capacity, low-latency data transmission. The FIG project—one of the largest subsea cable systems in the GCC—connects Qatar, Oman, UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq into a single high-capacity network. Delivered with ASN, FIG offers 24 fibre pairs and over 720 Tbps capacity, enabling faster, secure connectivity between the GCC and Europe.\nFurther strategic milestones have already been achieved during the first half, including landing agreements in Kuwait and Iraq; reinforcing these markets roles as digital transit hubs and expanding Ooredoo’s footprint across critical data corridors linking Asia and Europe.\nOoredoo is positioning itself as a key enabler of global connectivity by addressing the surging data demand between Asia and Europe. The FIG project reinforces Ooredoo’s digital infrastructure leadership and accelerates the Group’s strategic ambitions in AI, cloud, and data services.\nFinancial highlights\nRevenue\nGroup revenue rose to QAR 11.9 billion for the first half of the year, representing a robust 4% YoY increase excluding the impact of the Myanmar exit.\nStrong performance in Iraq, Algeria, Tunisia, Qatar and Kuwait underpinned this growth, reflecting effective operational execution and targeted investment in high-value areas to enable sustainable long-term growth.\nEBITDA & EBITDA Margin\nGroup EBITDA grew by 3% YoY excluding the impact of the Myanmar exit, reaching QAR 5.1 billion. EBITDA margin remained consistent at 43%.\nKuwait, Algeria, Iraq, Tunisia, and Maldives enhanced their contribution to overall Group profitability, reinforcing the benefits of our balanced portfolio.\nNet Profit\nFor H1 2025, we delivered sustainable net profit growth, underpinned by operational strength. Net profit increased by 4% YoY to reach QAR 1.9 billion. This includes the impact of Pillar 2, aligned with new global minimum tax requirements amounting to QAR 112 million.\nNormalised Net Profit increased by 3% YoY to QAR 1.9 billion. Normalised Net Profit is adjusted for foreign exchange, impairment and exceptional items.\nWe are driving strong and sustainable profitability through disciplined execution, strategic investments, and a clear focus on long-term value creation for our shareholders.\nCapital expenditure (CAPEX)\nThe Group invested QAR 1.5 billion of CAPEX for H1 2025, a 49% increase YoY, primarily driven by strategic network and infrastructure investments in Iraq, Tunisia, Algeria, Kuwait, and Oman.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow declined by 11% to QAR 3.6 billion as solid EBITDA performance was offset by accelerated rollouts of targeted network projects. This aligns with our strategic and disciplined investment approach, designed to strengthen our long-term position, while unlocking operating leverage and supporting further margin expansion.\nDebt\nOoredoo Group maintained its healthy financial and liquidity position during H1 2025 with investment-grade ratings. As at 30 June 2025, the Group’s Net-Debt-to-EBITDA ratio stood at 0.7x, below the Board’s guidance of 1.5x to 2.5x.\nThe Group maintains a prudent approach, maintaining a predominantly fixed-rate profile, and providing strong protection against interest rate volatility and enhancing stability.\nThe Group has QAR 14.8 billion in cash reserves (net of restricted cash) and QAR 5.5 billion available in undrawn facilities, reflecting a strong liquidity position.\nCustomer base\nThe Group’s customer base grew by 4% YoY to 51.9 million. Including IOH, total customers reached a total of 147.2 million, highlighting strong demand and operational scale.\nGuidance\nOoredoo Group is progressing steadily towards its FY 2025 target, with expected revenue growth of between 2% to 3% and an EBITDA margin in the low 40% range. Additionally, full-year CAPEX is projected to range between QAR 4.5 billion to 5.0 billion as planned spending accelerates in the second half of the year.\nOperating Companies H1 2025 highlights\nMiddle East\nOoredoo Qatar\nOoredoo Qatar continued to hold its premium position in the market, with a significant advantage in ARPU despite a flat overall market.\nFor H1 2025, the operation delivered a robust performance with topline growth and a strong EBITDA margin supported by operational efficiency gains.\nReported revenue for H1 2025 reflected positive momentum with a 1% increase YoY to QAR 3,608 million.

It also strengthens the operation’s premium technology positioning, unlocking new monetisation avenues and supporting long-term value creation through AI-driven enterprise solutions.\nOoredoo Kuwait\nOoredoo Kuwait maintained growth momentum underpinned by service revenue uplift, strong EBITDA margin expansion, and ongoing customer acquisition against the backdrop of a mature and highly saturated mobile market.\nThe operation delivered strong service revenue growth of 6% YoY driven by an uptake in voice, data, and digital services.

These external headwinds, however, adversely impacted overall performance.\nThe operation reported a 7% YoY decline in revenue to QAR 185 million, while EBITDA decreased by 6% YoY to QAR 73 million, reflecting ongoing macroeconomic pressures amid conflict-driven market disruption.
