  "text": "Nationwide — Trey Young and Preston Weaver, the founders of Blankit Media, a Black-owned, next-generation entertainment company powered by generative AI, are developing tools that empower creators to build, manage, and monetize their own AI-powered virtual influencers. The company has launched a Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) campaign on StartEngine to raise capital for the continued development of its proprietary AI toolset.\nBlankit Media’s AI systems integrate generative video, synthetic voice, and animated character technology, enabling creators to generate original content for their virtual influencers and distribute it across platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. The company’s goal is to streamline content creation and publishing while helping creators retain full ownership of their intellectual property.\n“We want to give creators superpowers,” said Trey Young, Co-Founder and CEO of Blankit Media. “We’re building tools that let anyone create their own AI influencer, test content in real time, and compete at the level of a full media studio.”\nThe company’s creator-led content attracted over 66 million views last quarter alone, demonstrating strong engagement and monetization potential. The new funding will support Blankit Media’s transition to a fully AI-powered production model capable of launching original video series, forming branded character partnerships, and licensing animated influencer IP.\nProceeds from the Reg CF campaign will be used to:\n• Expand proprietary AI video and voice generation tools\n• Launch original AI-native video series and characters\n• Build branded content and licensing partnerships\n• Scale publishing across monetized short-form platforms\n• Accelerate trend testing and performance optimization through automation\nAbout the Founders\nTrey Young, Co-Founder and CEO, is a serial entrepreneur with over 20 years of experience across media, music, and influencer marketing. He launched his first company at 18 and has led ventures that have generated more than 100 million views across digital platforms.\nPreston Weaver, Co-Founder and CFO, brings 12 years of experience in financial strategy and five years in media operations. He focuses on building scalable systems that turn AI-powered media into a sustainable, high-growth business.\nAs two young Black cousins and entrepreneurs from Atlanta, Trey and Preston are building Blankit Media to reshape the future of content creation, making cutting-edge media tools accessible to creators from all backgrounds.\nThe crowdfunding campaign is now live and open to both accredited and non-accredited investors.\nLearn more or invest: StartEngine.com/blankit-media\nFor press inquiries, contact info@blankitmeida.com or (678) 572-3617",
