  "text": "Car News\nAI-Made Tata Sierra Ad Goes Viral, And It’s Not From Tata Motors\nAn AI-generated TVC for the upcoming Tata Sierra has gone viral online. Created by a YouTube user, the cinematic video showcases the SUV across ice, desert, and coastal terrains.\nAI-Made Tata Sierra Ad Goes Viral, And It’s Not From Tata Motors (Credits: Kapil Dev Anand / YouTube)\nWhile we wait for Tata Motors to officially launch the new Tata Sierra in India, an AI-generated TV commercial is making waves online, and it’s not from the company itself.\nThe SUV, first revealed in a near-production avatar at the 2025 Auto Expo, has already caught the attention of fans.

Then we’re back in snowy terrain, where the SUV is seen powering through a bend on a snow-covered road, kicking up snow in style.\nFrom there, the video takes us to high-altitude dirt trails, followed by scenes of the Sierra taking on sand dunes, complete with an action-packed shot of it jumping over one. A scenic drive along a coastal road, surrounded by palm trees (possibly somewhere in Kerala), follows next.\nIt all wraps up with a peaceful shot of the Sierra parked on a cliff, rear section facing the ocean, overlooking the sea. Though this AI-generated ad isn’t an official Tata Motors production, it certainly manages to capture the adventurous vibe the brand is going for with the new Sierra. And if nothing else, it’s got fans even more excited for what’s to come.\n(Source: Kapil Dev Anand / YouTube)\nAyush Arya author\nAyush's love for automobiles started with his grandfather's old Suzuki.
