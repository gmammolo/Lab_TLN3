  "text": "\"[Stablecoin] is perhaps the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet.\"\nThat's what President Trump said at the signing ceremony of the GENIUS Act, a bill that sets up a regulatory framework for stablecoins on July 18.\nThe background of the U.S. rapid push for Genius legislation goes beyond mere technology acceptance and the strategic response of the U.S. in the face of a dilemma.\nTo understand the true intentions of the Genius Bill, we first need to know what economic dilemma the United States is currently in.\nCurrently, the United States is facing two difficult challenges.\nFirst, we need to strengthen our gradually weakening dollar hegemony, and second, under the slogan Make America Great Again (MAGA), we need huge fiscal spending to revive manufacturing and secure leadership in high-tech industries such as AI.\nStable demand for government bonds is essential to maintain dollar hegemony.\nHowever, as the U.S.-China conflict intensifies, China has continued to sell U.S. government bonds, while its ally Japan has also reduced its purchases of government bonds, weakening its demand base to prop up U.S. debt.\nThat's where the unexpected answer comes in.\nIt's stablecoins and digital assets.\nAccording to Maelstrom's analysis, for every 100 won increase in the market capitalization of digital assets over the past five years, stablecoins of 8.6 won have been issued on average.\nUnder the Genius Act, stablecoin issuers must hold stable assets such as U.S. bonds as collateral in proportion to the amount of stablecoins issued.\nA recent report by the U.S. Treasury Department's Board of Borrowing Advisers (TBAC) suggests that the continued growth of stablecoins could generate about $1 trillion worth of additional government bond demand.\nIn other words, when funds flow into digital assets, stablecoin issuance increases and issuers buy large amounts of U.S. government bonds, creating a structure that supports U.S. debt.\nAlready, major stablecoin issuers are playing an important role in bolstering U.S. dollar hegemony.\nUSDT (Tether) had over $120 billion in U.S. government bonds as of March 2025, ahead of Germany ($111.4 billion) and ranked 19th among global holders.\nTether bought a net $33.1 billion in U.S. Treasuries in 2024, ranking seventh among countries worldwide.\nIn the end, the growth of digital assets and stablecoins is directly linked to \"new demand for U.S. government bonds.\"\nEven if China sells U.S. government bonds, the gap will be filled by demand for stablecoins.\nThe Trump administration's rush to put the Genius bill into effect is also interpreted as a sketch to institutionalize and accelerate this trend.\nAll of these moves are not a one-off response, but are likely part of a thoroughly designed 'crypto–dollar–AI' virtuous cycle.\nThis cycle operates as follows.\nCreate a positive market atmosphere through friendly digital asset policies.\nA case in point is the allowance of the $9 trillion retirement pension (401K) in the United States along with the Genius Act.\nDigital Asset Boom Increases Demand for Stablecoins.\nIncreased stablecoin reserves support U.S. Treasury demand.\nThe U.S. invests heavily in AI, technology industries with funds raised by issuing government bonds.\nAs a result, a virtuous cycle structure is completed in which the US's high-tech hegemony and dollar hegemony are strengthened at the same time.\nAfter all, the Genius Bill means more than just a stablecoin regulation bill.\nThis is a strategic paving stone to acknowledge the possibility of stablecoins becoming a global payment method, while solidifying demand for U.S. government bonds through stablecoins and digital assets, and designing a new dollar hegemony order in the digital age.\nIt is also clear why the U.S. has policies that are friendly to the digital asset market.\nIt's part of a national strategy to stabilize finances and maintain global leadership beyond just embracing technology.\nThe future of stablecoins and digital assets is soon the future of the dollar, which in turn is the first ring of the macro cycle leading to stronger AI and high-tech initiatives in the United States.\nNow the United States is legislating and institutionalizing that ring.\nIn the next contribution, we will take a closer look at how global leaders such as Coinbase and Stripe are responding to this situation and what implications they have for Korea.\n[Lee Hyesung's Arc Point COO]",
