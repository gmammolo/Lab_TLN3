  "text": "Technology- 2 min read\nArunachal Pradesh launches online building permit system\nArunachal Pradesh has launched an online building permission system. Balo Raja, the Urban Affairs Minister, inaugurated the digital platform. The system aims to streamline building permit issuance across the state. It promises improved efficiency and transparency. The online system will be used for all construction permits. The government emphasizes public awareness and compliance.\nITANAGAR:\nArunachal Pradesh Urban AffairsMinister Balo Raja on Wednesday launched the online building permission system (OBPS), a fully digital platform designed to streamline the issuance of building construction permits across the state.\nSpeaking at the launch event, the minister said the new system will improve efficiency, transparency, and accessibility, and marks a shift to online-only permit issuance for all construction, be it public, private, government, or business.\n\"OBPS aligns with the state government's ongoing efforts to enhance public service delivery under the Ease of Doing Business framework,\" Raja said.\nHe emphasised the importance of wide publicity to ensure that the public is aware of the system's benefits as well as the consequences of non-compliance.\nTo support this transition, the Directorate of Town Planning will migrate its website from a static to a dynamic platform. The upgraded website will be interactive, more user-friendly, and capable of handling large volumes of data and transactions, including online payments.\nChief Secretary Manish Kumar Gupta hailed the launch as a historic milestone for the state.\n\"OBPS will deregulate and simplify the building permit process, significantly reducing approval times,\" he said.\nGupta also noted the flexibility of the portal, which allows easy upgrades and customisations to meet departmental and user needs. He added that, in time, OBPS will be handed over to urban local bodies (ULBs) for implementation, or to deputy commissioner-led local planning authorities in districts where ULBs have not yet been formed.\nUrban Affairs Secretary Nyali Ete outlined the operational aspects of OBPS.\nHe explained that all applications for building permits must now be submitted online, and architects and other professionals are required to register on the portal. The system will be managed by the local planning authority in each district, chaired by the deputy commissioner and supported by the town planner as member secretary.\nOBPS is a joint initiative of the Town and Country Planning Organisation (TCPO) under the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, and the state Directorate of Town Planning and the state Urban Affairs Department.\nTechnical support is provided by NIC Shillong, while the eDCR software has been developed by E-Government Foundation, Bengaluru.\nThe customisation of the\nArunachal PradeshBuilding Bye Laws (APBBL) 2019 and system flowchart were also handled by NIC Shillong. The entire cost of developing the eDCR software was borne by the central ministry under the AMRUT mission as part of the prescribed urban reforms for EoDB.",
