  "text": "One of my favorite little perks of the Chromebook Plus ecosystem has always been the exclusive “Dawn to Dusk” wallpapers and screen savers. It’s a simple, elegant feature: you pick a theme, and your wallpaper subtly changes its lighting throughout the day to match the time, while the screen saver provides a beautiful, slow animation of the same scene.\nThe only problem? For the nearly two years since this feature debuted, we’ve only had two options to choose from. Thankfully, that has finally changed. A gorgeous new third option has arrived, and it takes us on a journey to the largest planet in our solar system: Jupiter.\nA stunning new view of Jupiter I’m a sucker for great space imagery, and this new wallpaper does not disappoint. The new “Jupiter” theme gives you a stunning, high-resolution view of the gas giant, and seeing it subtly change throughout the day is a real treat. In the morning, you’ll see the light begin to creep across the planet’s surface, and as your day progresses, that light source shifts, highlighting different storms and bands in the iconic atmosphere. It’s a beautiful, dynamic way to liven up your desktop.\nDon’t forget the animated screen saver The screen saver is just as impressive. When your Chromebook goes idle, you’re treated to a gentle, slow-moving animation of the planet. The subtle rotation and the fun animations make for a serene and visually captivating screen saver that is far more interesting than a simple slideshow of photos.\nThis is a fantastic and long-overdue addition to a feature I really love; and one I hope that is the beginning of far more of this treatment. It’s a small thing, for sure, but these kinds of thoughtful, high-quality visual touches are what make the overall Chromebook Plus experience feel more premium and personalized. If you have a Chromebook Plus, I highly recommend you head into your Wallpaper & Style settings (just righ-click on your desktop) and give this new theme a look.\nJoin Chrome Unboxed Plus Introducing Chrome Unboxed Plus – our revamped membership community.
