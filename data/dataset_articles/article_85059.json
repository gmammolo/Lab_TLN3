  "text": "Google’s personalized AI research assistant, NotebookLM, continues to rapidly evolve into an incredibly powerful tool for learning and productivity. This week, Google is rolling out two major updates that were first teased at I/O: the introduction of Video Overviews and a powerful, redesigned Studio panel that unlocks a whole new level of flexibility.\nTurn your notes into a video with ‘Video Overviews’ Most of you are already big fans of NotebookLM’s Audio Overviews, which are great for absorbing information while multitasking. But sometimes, a visual aid is necessary to truly understand a complex topic. That’s where the new Video Overviews come in.\nThis new feature, now rolling out, is a new category of output in the Studio panel. The first format takes the form of narrated slides. Think of it as a visual alternative to an Audio Overview; the AI host creates new visuals to help illustrate points while also pulling in images, diagrams, quotes, and numbers directly from your source documents. This makes it uniquely effective for explaining data, demonstrating processes, and making abstract concepts more tangible.\nJust like with Audio Overviews, you can customize the video to your needs by specifying topics to focus on, describing the target audience, and much more. Video Overviews are now rolling out to all users in English, with support for more languages coming soon.\nThe new, more powerful Studio is a multitasker’s dream The second part of this update is a complete overhaul of the Studio panel, and it solves a major limitation of the previous version. Until now, you could only create one of each output type per notebook (e.g., one Mind Map, one Study Guide), which could be restrictive.\nThat’s no longer the case. With the redesigned Studio, you can now create and store multiple studio outputs of the same type in a single notebook. This unlocks some exciting new possibilities:\nStudying for a big exam? You can now create separate Mind Maps or Video Overviews, each focusing on a different chapter of your course notes. Managing a team notebook? You can create different Audio and Video Overviews tailored to different roles to save everyone time. Have a public notebook? You can create a set of Audio Overviews in different languages to make your content globally accessible. The new Studio has four distinct tiles at the top for creating Audio Overviews, Video Overviews, Mind Maps, and Reports, with all your creations appearing in a list below. And to further boost your productivity, you can now multi-task within the Studio panel, letting you listen to an Audio Overview while simultaneously exploring a Mind Map.\nThis is a fantastic pair of updates that makes NotebookLM an even more flexible and powerful tool for understanding, creating, and sharing information. The new Studio will be rolling out to all users over the next few weeks.\nJoin Chrome Unboxed Plus Introducing Chrome Unboxed Plus – our revamped membership community.
