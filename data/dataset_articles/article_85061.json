  "text": "BATON ROUGE, La. (Louisiana First) — A natural diversion of the Mississippi River is creating new land in Louisiana, offering insights into coastal restoration efforts. Scientists have identified a naturally occurring diversion in Quarantine Bay, part of Breton Sound, as a significant development in the region’s coastal landscape. This new land formation is being described as the biggest change to the Mississippi River in a century. Captain Ryan Lambert, who runs Cajun Fishing Adventures, expressed frustration over Louisiana’s coastal restoration efforts, stating, “And within six months, we have totally gutted it and ruined it. And now, now we’re literally the laughing stock everywhere in the country.” Polly Glover, a coastal restoration advocate, emphasized the importance of understanding the changes, saying, “If you’re living here in Louisiana, you should want to crusade for the coast.” Geologist Alex Kolker from LUMCON confirmed the diversion’s impact, noting, “What we found is that that Delta was basically half to three-quarters larger than you would expect from scour alone.” Captain Ryan Lambert, who has been operating in the area for 47 years, is passionate about the project, having witnessed significant land loss on the west side of the river. LSU coastal sciences students Frank Bussot and Jameson Woodall are studying the new land formation, with Bussot noting the difference between reading about Louisiana’s struggles and seeing them firsthand. Jameson Woodall observed significant changes in the landscape since his last visit two years ago, highlighting the rapid development of vegetation on previously barren mudflats. Polly Glover’s father, John Land, was a civil engineer who worked on diversions in Louisiana, including one on Bayou LaMoque. The natural diversion of the Mississippi River presents a unique opportunity for Louisiana to learn from natural processes in its ongoing fight against coastal erosion. As scientists continue to study the phenomenon, the insights gained could shape future restoration efforts. Governor Landry has canceled the Mid Barataria Sediment Diversion project, a key initiative aimed at addressing coastal land loss in Louisiana. The project, which broke ground two years ago, was part of a larger coastal restoration program designed to reconnect the Mississippi River to the wetlands, a process supported by the America’s Wetland Foundation. Val Marmillion, former director of America’s Wetland Foundation, expressed disappointment, stating that canceling the project undermines decades of work by multiple governors to mitigate coastal land loss. Marmillion emphasized the importance of natural processes in restoring Louisiana’s wetlands, which have been disconnected from the river since 1927 due to levee construction by the Corps of Engineers. He highlighted the historical significance of the wetlands, which were once considered wastelands but have since become vital for local communities who hunt, fish, and live in these areas. Marmillion also noted the political nature of the decision, suggesting that the narrative around the project has been influenced by political agendas rather than scientific facts. Val Marmillion has been involved in coastal restoration efforts for many years, including work on coastal management plans. The cancellation of the Mid Barataria Sediment Diversion project raises concerns about the future of Louisiana’s coastal restoration efforts and the impact on communities reliant on the wetlands.
