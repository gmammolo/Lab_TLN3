  "text": "Lenovo has maintained its top position in the Gartner Asia/Pacific Supply Chain Top 10 for 2025, the fourth consecutive year it has led the ranking among companies in the APAC region.\nThe list compiled by Gartner recognises supply chain performance across several criteria, highlighting adaptability to growth, use of technology for efficiency and resilience, and sustainability efforts including circular innovation. Lenovo's placement reflects the company's ongoing transformation of its global supply chain and manufacturing network. The 2025 report also placed Lenovo at number eight in Gartner's Global Supply Chain Top 25, an improvement of two spots compared to the previous year.\nThe recognition has been attributed to Lenovo's focus on AI, operational standards, and environmental, social and governance goals. According to Lenovo, these areas have strengthened its presence as a major organisation in global supply chain innovation and adaptability.\nGlobal supply chain\nLenovo's supply chain operates in 180 markets and includes over 30 manufacturing sites across 11 different countries. This global reach has been described as being a crucial asset for managing both geopolitical and economic challenges in recent years.\nTo support customers in the Middle East and Africa, Lenovo is planning to expand its manufacturing base into Saudi Arabia. The company said that this development will extend its regional footprint, capitalise on market opportunities in MEA, and allow faster delivery of products and services for customers in those markets.\nCommenting on the announcement, Amar Babu, President of Lenovo Asia Pacific, said:\n\"It's an honor to be named No. 1 in Asia Pacific for the fourth year and moving up in the global rankings is a powerful validation of our efforts to build a smarter, more resilient supply chain. From AI-powered tools to sustainable logistics, our innovations are helping customers and partners gain an operational edge in a dynamic world.\"\nInvestment in the manufacturing footprint and supply chain network, according to Lenovo, reinforces its ability to remain agile in response to shifts in the global business environment while maintaining service standards.\nAI adoption\nA central element of Lenovo's strategy is the \"Lenovo Powers Lenovo\" approach, using in-house technology and infrastructure to upgrade core operations. The company has increased the use of AI across its supply chain, affecting areas such as manufacturing processes, logistics, sustainability reporting, and customer service functions.\nLenovo has internally developed an AI-enabled tool that provides real-time risk notifications and automates decision-making across its supply chain. The tool is designed to detect disruptions, such as congestion in logistics routes, and then suggest and evaluate alternative logistics options along with related costs. This aim is to support faster and more efficient responses to supply chain challenges as they occur.\nSustainability\nSupply chain leaders in the APAC region have increasingly prioritised sustainability, with a particular emphasis on circular approaches. Lenovo reports integration of recycled materials into over 298 of its product lines, including the adoption of carbon fibre sourced from aircraft manufacturing by-products. Product packaging has also seen changes, with the company using materials derived from sugar cane and bamboo in a bid to promote responsible manufacturing.\nIn addition to its overall ranking, Lenovo received the number three position in the Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 and Masters for 2025: High Tech Top 10 ranking.\nThe Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 for 2025 was delivered in research reports dated July 2025, authored by Teh Leng Tan, Sergio Coelho, Alejandro Santalo, and Cori Masters, and in methodology and commentary specified by Gartner. Gartner's methodology assesses companies based on a range of capability, leadership, and performance metrics.\nGartner's official stance notes that the company does not endorse any vendor, product or service featured in its publications. All research represents the views of the Gartner research division and should not be interpreted as statements of fact. Gartner also disclaims express or implied warranties in relation to its findings.",
