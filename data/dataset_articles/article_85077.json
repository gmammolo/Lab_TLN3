  "text": "30 Jul, 2025 Influencer sentiment soars as Tesla partners with Samsung for next-gen AI chip, reveals GlobalData\nPosted inBusiness Fundamentals\nTesla has emerged as a trending company among influencers on X, primarily due to its significant $16.5 billion contract with Samsung Electronics for the manufacturing of advanced semiconductors. This partnership marks a pivotal moment for both companies. For Tesla, it solidifies its position in the competitive electric vehicle (EV) and AI landscape, while for Samsung, it represents a crucial step in diversifying its semiconductor business beyond traditional markets like smartphones, reveals the Social Media Analytics Platform of GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.\nShreyasee Majumder, Social Media Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “The sentiment reflects a belief that Samsung’s advanced 2-nanometer technology will enhance Tesla’s capabilities in artificial intelligence (AI) and EVs. Many express confidence in the potential advantages of the partnership, highlighting that Tesla’s decision to collaborate with Samsung may help ease the reliance on TSMC, which currently holds a dominant position in the semiconductor market.”\nBelow are a few popular influencer opinions captured by GlobalData’s Social Media Analytics Platform:\n“Tesla is a physical AI company + software AI company. It is the only company, today, that is tying both branches of AI together at scale. It will not be the only one in the end, but it is the only one now…”\n“$TSLA choosing Samsung for its AI6 chip is not a negative for $TSM. Based on what was reported and my thoughts, I believe Elon has negotiated very favorable terms with Samsung for $TSLA’s chips, as Samsung wants to land a big customer on the leading-edge node. (Reports are that Samsung will make a loss from this project.)\n“More broadly, I think it also shows that $TSM is fully booked and busy with its biggest clients, such as $NVDA, $AAPL, and others. According to recent reports, many of the big clients have shifted almost entirely to $TSM due to better yields. For Elon it is a smart move to take the chance on Samsung as $TSLA was not the priority customer for $TSM. With xAI he is still on of the biggest buyers of $NVDA chips which are made by $TSM, so he can get supplied by both….”\n“Samsung wins $16.5B Tesla deal to make AI6 chips in Texas thru 2033. Major breakthrough for Samsung’s foundry business (8% share) vs TSMC’s 68% market share. Diversifies Samsung beyond smartphones into AI/robotics, providing US domestic alternative to Taiwan production.”\n“Samsung will manufacture Tesla’s chips using 2-nanometer (nm) process technology – this is basically the very latest manufacturing tech. It’s a big deal for Samsung to prove it can handle such a contract with the hope other big names will follow”",
