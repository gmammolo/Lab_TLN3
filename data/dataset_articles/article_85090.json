  "text": "Bitcoin News Today: BTCC Trading Volume Surges 35% After Adding 80 New Spot Pairs\nBTCC, the world’s longest-serving cryptocurrency exchange, has reported a 35% month-over-month increase in trading volume in July 2025, following the listing of over 80 new spot trading pairs. The addition of these pairs, including SPX6900 (SPX), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), Movement (MOVE), Magic Eden (ME), and Zora (ZORA), has significantly boosted the platform’s average daily spot trading volume to $4.5 million. This expansion brought the total number of spot pairs to more than 300 and futures pairs to over 380, reinforcing the exchange’s position as a major player in the cryptocurrency trading market [1].\nThe move reflects BTCC’s strategy to provide traders with timely access to emerging and high-demand tokens. Popular tokens such as MANTA, XRP, BTC, ETH, and SOL have seen strong performance in the spot market, while XRP, ETH, BTC, SOL, DOGE, and PENGU continue to lead in futures trading. According to Alex Hung, Head of Operations at BTCC, the rapid expansion has been driven by the recovery in the broader crypto market and the need to meet evolving user demands [2].\nBTCC has also launched Round 6 of its Hot Coins Trading Week campaign, featuring enhanced rewards for users trading trending coins such as SPK, PENGU, and PUMP. The campaign aims to attract both new and existing users by offering competitive trading opportunities during a period of renewed market optimism [3]. Analysts have noted that the success of such initiatives underscores the importance of product innovation and agility in the fast-moving crypto landscape [4].\nThe 35% growth in trading volume highlights the impact of BTCC’s operational strategy, which includes diversifying its asset offerings and improving liquidity across multiple asset classes. While the exchange has not provided a geographic breakdown of the volume, the figures suggest a broad-based increase in user engagement and market confidence. The addition of over 80 new spot pairs has also enabled traders to adopt more dynamic strategies, further enhancing the exchange’s appeal [5].\nAs the crypto market continues to mature, platforms like BTCC that prioritize user experience, innovation, and responsiveness to market trends are well-positioned to sustain growth. The July 2025 results demonstrate BTCC’s ability to adapt and expand in a competitive environment, reinforcing its commitment to making crypto trading accessible and reliable for a global user base [6].\nSource:\n[1] BTCC Exchange Reports 35% Trading Volume Growth Following Listing of Over 80 New Spot Trading Pairs in July 2025\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/30/3124227/0/en/BTCC-Exchange-Reports-35-Trading-Volume-Growth-Following-Listing-of-Over-80-New-Spot-Trading-Pairs-in-July-2025.html\n[2] Press Releases - X\nhttps://x.com/press_newswire/status/1950565567141687418\n[3] BTCC Exchange Achieves Remarkable 35% Growth in Trading Volume\nhttps://investorshangout.com/btcc-exchange-achieves-remarkable-35-growth-in-trading-volume-344216-/\n[4] Latest News and Press Releases\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/search/tag/crypto\n[5] BTCC Exchange Reports 35% Trading Volume Growth Following Listing of Over 80 New Spot Trading Pairs in July 2025\nhttps://x.com/ChainwirePR/status/1950564643094532206\n[6] Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2 Presale Nears $6M - Next Crypto to ...\nhttps://en.cryptonomist.ch/2025/07/30/bitcoin-hyper-layer-2-presale-nears-6m-next-crypto-to-explode/\nComments\nNo comments yet",
