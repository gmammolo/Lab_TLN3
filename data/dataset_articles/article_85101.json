  "text": "As Samsung prepares to launch the next generation of its tablets later this year, leaks have already started to surface. We were previously treated to a render of the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra, which revealed some tweaks to its design. Now, a new certification listing has shed more light on the tablet.\nThe Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra has been spotted in Finland’s SGS Fimko database. The listing shows three variants: SM-X936B, SM-X936N, and SM-X930. These are expected to be the 5G and WiFi version, the WiFi-only model, and the South Korean edition respectively.\nImage: XpertPick But more importantly, the listing shows the device’s battery capacity and charging speed. The Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra will reportedly pack an 11,600mAh battery, which is a slight upgrade compared to its precursor’s 11,200mAh capacity. However, the charging speed is kept at 45W, which may come as a disappointment for those expecting an upgrade.\nSource: Evan Blass via X Aside from the battery information, not much is known about the upcoming flagship tablet. It has been said that the device will be equipped with a MediaTek Dimensity 9400+ chipset. Moreover, it will apparently run on Android 16 via One UI 8. Of course, these are still rumours at this point, and we’ll only know if the information is accurate once the company officially releases the tablet.\n(Source: XpertPick via AndroidPolice )",
