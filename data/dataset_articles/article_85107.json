  "text": "Researchers in Japan have identified a molecular mechanism linked to the DJ-1 gene, which is associated with recessive Parkinson’s disease. Through molecular simulations and biochemical assays, including mutational analyses, the study confirms that DJ-1 plays a critical role in breaking down cyclic 3-phosphoglyceric anhydride—a highly reactive and toxic cellular metabolite. The findings shed light on how mutations in the DJ-1 gene contribute to the development of hereditary Parkinson’s disease.\nThe research focused on understanding how DJ-1 hydrolyzes this harmful metabolite, which can accumulate and damage cells if not properly regulated. By employing advanced molecular simulations alongside laboratory-based biochemical tests, scientists examined the behavior of both normal and mutant forms of the DJ-1 protein. Mutational analyses provided further insight into how specific changes in the gene disrupt its function, leading to cellular toxicity and contributing to Parkinson’s pathogenesis. These results offer a deeper understanding of the biological processes underlying this genetic form of Parkinson’s disease.\nNewsflash | Powered by GeneOnline AI\nSource: GO-AI-ne1\nDate: July 30, 2025",
