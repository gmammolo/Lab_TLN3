  "text": "Another major Israeli cybersecurity firm has been sold in a blockbuster deal. Following Wiz's $32 billion sale, CyberArk is now being acquired by Palo Alto Networks for $25 billion. Founded about 20 years ago by Israeli Nir Zuk, Palo Alto is the world's largest cybersecurity company.Palo Alto Networks on Wednesday said that it's agreed to buy Israeli cybersecurity firm CyberArk for around $25 billion in cash and stock. CyberArk stockholders will receive $45 in cash and just over 2.2 Palo Alto shares per CyberArk share, reports Axios. This is the year's second cybersecurity megadeal, following Google's $32 billion agreement with Wiz.“Today, the rise of AI and the explosion of machine identities have made it clear that the future of security must be built on the vision that every identity requires the right level of privilege controls,” says Palo Alto chairman and CEO Nikesh Arora. “CyberArk is the definitive leader in Identity Security with durable, foundational technology that is essential for securing the AI era.”Udi Mokady, Founder and Executive Chairman of CyberArk, said: \\\"This is a profound moment in CyberArk's journey. From the beginning, we set out to protect the world's most critical assets, with a relentless focus on innovation, trust, and security. Joining forces with Palo Alto Networks is a powerful next chapter, built on shared values and a deep commitment to solving the toughest identity challenges. Together, we'll bring unmatched expertise across human and machine identities, privileged access, and AI-driven innovation to secure what's next. This is more than a combination of technologies—it's an acceleration of the mission we began over two decades ago. I'm incredibly proud of what our team has built and deeply grateful to everyone who made this milestone possible.\\\"What does CyberArk do?According to a report in Times of Israel, Cyberark is an Israeli cybersecurity firm and is traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange since 2014 with a market cap of almost $22 billion. The company specializes in identity security, including privileged accounts on corporate servers, to help businesses protect sensitive data and critical infrastructure against external attackers and malicious insiders, the report suggests.CyberArk specializes in privileged access management, technology that helps organizations safeguard sensitive systems by limiting and monitoring access to critical accounts. Its customers include Carnival Corp, Panasonic and Aflac, Performance Food Group, State of Louisiana, Barclays, Coles Group, American Electric Power Company among others. \\\"Our mission is to secure the world against cyber threats so together we can move fearlessly forward,\\\" the company's website says. Analysts said Palo Alto could accelerate its AI security push by tapping its large salesforce to drive adoption of CyberArk's tools, seen as vital for securing AI systems. \\\"It helps broaden the portfolio since Palo Alto does not have any offering in the 'identity' space,\\\" said Imtiaz Koujalgi, Roth Capital Partners' managing director of software research.\\\"Palo Alto also has been seeing growth slow in its next‑generation security portfolio, so adding CYBR will be helpful in driving incremental traction.\\\"Global cybersecurity spending is set to grow 12.2% in 2025 as rising AI-driven threats push companies to adopt stronger defenses, according to International Data Corp. The buyout is expected to close in fiscal 2026 and will immediately add to Palo Alto's revenue growth and gross margin.(With inputs from Reuters)",
