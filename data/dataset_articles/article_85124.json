  "text": "Solving the world's challenges\nIn Ohio State’s College of Engineering, researchers pursue novel solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges, improving lives, advancing industries and driving innovation.\nGovernment funding is crucial to this work. In fiscal year 2024, nearly 62% of the college’s $207.49 million in external research funding came from federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy and National Institutes of Health. Industry partners sponsored an additional $63.47 million in collaborative projects.\n“Our faculty, students and staff are contributing to leading research advances across the engineering and architectural disciplines,” said Associate Dean for Research Seth Weinberg. “In turn, support from federal, state and industry funding enables us to tackle increasingly challenging and complex problems facing society.”\nBelow are just a few examples of projects currently underway.\nA new path to clean drinking water\nA chance discovery led Materials Science and Engineering Professor Perena Gouma and her team to develop a new material that can clear water of dangerous pollutants by harnessing the power of sunlight.\nConstructed from titanium dioxide and copper, these lightweight, easy-to-remove fiber mats can float and operate atop any body of water and are even reusable through multiple cleaning cycles. Because nanomats are so effective, researchers envision that they could be used to rid water of industrial pollutants in developing countries, turning otherwise contaminated rivers and lakes into sources of clean drinking water.\n“There hasn’t been an easy way to create something like a blanket that you can lay on water and start creating energy,” Gouma said. “But we are the only ones who have made these structures and the only ones to demonstrate that they actually work.”\nAdditionally, because this technology doesn’t generate any toxic byproducts, nanomats are extremely environmentally friendly. “It’s a safe material, it won’t hurt anything, and it’s as clean as it can be,” said Gouma.\nAlthough this team’s technology is incredibly efficient, how long it will take to scale up commercially depends on how quickly industries take notice. “We have the tools to make them in large quantities and translate them to various industries,” said Gouma. “The only limitation is that it needs someone to take advantage of these abundant resources.”\nThe team’s findings suggest that nanomats could be a promising tool in many future photocatalytic applications, including long-term sustainability efforts like environmental remediation as well as solar-driven hydrogen production. Their work was supported by the National Science Foundation.

This complex personal health data can then be transmitted via Bluetooth to a smartphone for quick and detailed analysis, said Materials Science and Engineering Assistant Professor Jinghua Li, who leads the work.\n“Our bodies carry lots of useful information that we’re not even aware of,” said Li. “These statuses also change over time, so it’s our goal to use electronics to extract and decode those signals to encourage better self health care checks.”\nIt’s estimated that at least 7% of Americans suffer from ambulatory difficulties during activities that include walking, running or climbing stairs. While efforts to manufacture a wearable insole-based pressure system have risen in popularity in recent years, many previous prototypes were met with low energy limitations and unstable performances.\nTo overcome the challenges of their precursors, Li and Qi Wang, a current PhD student in materials science and engineering, sought to ensure that their insole is durable, has a high degree of precision when collecting and analyzing data, and can provide consistent and reliable power.\n“Our device is innovative in terms of high resolution, spatial sensing, self-powering capability, and its ability to combine with machine learning algorithms,” Li said. “So we feel like this research can go further based on the pioneering successes of this field.”\nIn health care, the smart insoles could support gait analysis to detect early abnormalities associated with foot pressure-related conditions (such as diabetic foot ulcers), musculoskeletal disorders (such as plantar fasciitis) and neurological conditions (such as Parkinson’s disease).\nResearchers expect the technology will likely be available commercially within the next three to five years. Next steps to advance the work will be aimed at improving the system’s gesture recognition abilities.

However, these systems do create radioactive waste, which can be dangerous to human health and the environment. Safely disposing of this waste can be challenging.\nUsing a combination of scintillator crystals, high-density materials that emit light when they absorb radiation, and solar cells, the team of Ohio State engineers demonstrated that ambient gamma radiation could be harvested to produce a strong enough electric output to power microelectronics, like microchips.\nThese batteries would be used near where the nuclear waste is produced, such as storage pools or nuclear systems for space and deep sea exploration—they aren’t designed for public use. The battery itself does not incorporate radioactive materials, meaning it is still safe to touch.\n“We're harvesting something considered as waste and by nature, trying to turn it into treasure,” said project lead Raymond Cao, director of Ohio State’s Nuclear Reactor Lab and a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering.\nSince batteries of this type would most likely end up in environments where high levels of radiation already exist and aren't easily accessible to the public, these long-lasting devices wouldn’t pollute their surroundings. Even more significantly, they could also operate without the need for routine maintenance.\nScaling this technology up would be costly unless these batteries could be reliably manufactured, said Cao. Further research is needed to assess the batteries’ usefulness and limitations, including how long they might last once safely implemented, said Ibrahim Oksuz, a research associate in mechanical and aerospace engineering.\n“The nuclear battery concept is very promising,” he said. “There's still lots of room for improvement, but I believe in the future, this approach will carve an important space for itself in both the energy production and sensors industry.”\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
