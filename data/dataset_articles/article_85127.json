  "text": "Gal Guardians: Servants of the Dark’s “4th Update” has been revealed via a new trailer. This update should be available on Switch right now, or will be in the very near future. In addition, the team announced that the online multiplayer functionality, originally scheduled for release as part of this update, will now be arriving sometime in Fall 2025. You can read the full patch notes below.\n- A new gameplay Style, “Ultimaid”, is now available after clearing the game.\n- The servant Akromatik now offers an in-game illustration gallery.\n- A new event starts with the servant Orlan after meeting certain conditions.\n- New sub-weapons, “Royal Arms” and “Summon Pod” are available.\n- Some parts of the map, enemies, and weapon skills have been adjusted for balance.\n- Various other parts of the game have been adjusted for balance.\n■Notice of postponement of online multiplayer\nOriginally scheduled for implementation in the 4th monthly update, online multiplayer has been unfortunately postponed to achieve stability on all platforms. We sincerely apologize to the players who were looking forward to this crucial feature. Currently, we estimate that we will be able to release the feature in Fall 2025. We will announced when a more specific date is determined. The team is striving as hard as possible to get online working for players even a single day earlier. We humbly ask for your patience.\n“Gal Guardians: Servants of the Dark” is the newest title in the Gal Guardians series of gothic-inspired 2D action-adventure games. “Servants of the Dark” greatly expands the setting from a single castle to the entirety of the Demon Realm, and further evolves the gameplay into a true Metroidvania adventure. It also stars two new characters with different playstyles, Kirika and Masha, who players can switch between in order to fully explore the vast areas and take down enemies and bosses.\nYou must search far and wide for the means to revive Kirika and Masha’s master, the Demon Lord Maxim, and restore him to power. In this upside-down world, you’ll fight alongside demons and against demons, as well as Demon Hunters from the Human Realm. Get ready for an unforgettable adventure!",
