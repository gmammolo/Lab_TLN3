  "text": "- Toncoin (TON) is currently trading at $3.36, showing a weekly gain of 6.38%.\n- Analysts predict a bullish continuation, citing strong support near $7.35–$7.37.\n- Forecasts suggest TON could exceed $8.24 in the coming months.\nToncoin (TON) is currently trading at $3.36, registering a 0.57% gain in the last 24 hours. Alongside the price action is the significant increase in trading volume, currently at $434.63 million, a strong 51.49% increase in daily trade. TON has gained 6.38% in the last seven days, registering strong market interest and stability amidst the volatility in the larger cryptocurrency market.\nMarket participants are closely monitoring TON’s consolidation pattern, especially following a substantial upward move. With trading momentum building, many investors are optimistic about a potential breakout in the near term.\nMomentum Build-Up Hints at Major Rally\nIn a recent study by Token Talk, TON shows a classic bullish flag or pennant formation on the 4-hour chart, normally an indication of trend continuation. The token is presently supported in a key support area of $7.35 to $7.37, suggesting the potential for another upward surge should the level prove support.\nToken Talk is predicting a successful breakout could spur a move back through the $7.45 to $7.50 range, potentially breaking through those levels should the momentum gain steam.\nThe current chart setup, along with continued support retention, is a good indication TON is entering a re-accumulation phase. These types of phases are typical precursors to significant price appreciation, so the token is priming for what analysts refer to as its “next parabolic leg.”\nAlso Read | TON Foundation Plans $400 Million Crypto Treasury to Hold Toncoin With Kingsway Capital support\nToncoin Price Forecast Remains Bullish\nLong-term predictions favor the belief that TON is set to keep gaining. DigitalCoinPrice estimates that Toncoin may transcend its earlier all-time high of $8.24 in the near term, targeting a target range of $6.56 to $7.38 before the end of the year. Past performance indicates that TON is back on the ascending course after falling below $4.78 earlier this year.\nThe Changelly forecast is even more upbeat, with 2024 projections for the TON price of between $10.24 and $11.25, and the approximate average trading price of around $12.25. While their July 2025 estimate is less exuberant, with TON being only in the range of $3.61 to $3.80, that could be short-term consolidation and not a longer-term trend reversal.\nMarket sentiment for the moment is therefore generally upbeat, with both technical indications and analyst expectations all pointing to a continued bull case for Toncoin. Traders and investors both continue to keep TON in their sights, hoping for confirmation of the next significant price move.\nAlso Read | Toncoin (TON) Price Analysis: Will It Break $5.30 or Rebound from $2.87 Support?",
