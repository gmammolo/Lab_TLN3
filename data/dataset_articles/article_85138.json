  "text": "Geely Automobile announced at a business conference that it will launch the Geely Galaxy M9, a full-size plug-in hybrid SUV, in the domestic market this year. This model will boast a price tag of around 250,000 yuan (34,830 USD). The Galaxy M9 aims to compete with seemingly pricier cars such as the Li Auto L9.\nThe M9 will become the flagship model of the Geely Galaxy new energy vehicle brand under Geely Automobile. This division was formed in 2023, becoming a strong sales driver for the company. This brand delivered 397,125 units from January to June 2025, according to China EV DataTracker. The current model line of the Geely Galaxy comprises ten cars. Soon, this crowded lineup will be broadened by the Galaxy M9 crossover.\nMore about Geely Galaxy M9\nThe Geely Galaxy M9 made its global debut in May 2025 in Milan. However, this model has yet to officially start sales in China. The M9 is a full-size crossover that adopts the brand’s latest “Ripple Aesthetics” design language. It boasts a closed front end with a wide LED strip that joins headlights. The vehicle adopts multi-spoke rims, a flat roofline, a single taillight unit, and conventional door handles.\nThe Geely Galaxy M9’s dimensions are 5205/1999/1800 mm with a wheelbase of 3,030 mm. For clarity, it is 4 mm shorter than the Mercedes-Benz GLS. Geely said that the M9 has the best-in-class in-cabin space utilization rate of 88.3%. It adopts six seats with a 2+2+2 layout. This model is also said to have the highest door opening in the class of 1,165 mm. Its cabin ceiling height reaches 1,317 mm.\nThe center console of the Galaxy M9 adopts a single 30-inch display. There is no instrument cluster inside this vehicle. Instead, it has an augmented-reality head-up display. The gear shifter of the car sits behind a three-spoke steering wheel. Its center tunnel offers a wireless phone charging pad and a couple of cup holders. What is more, the center tunnel could be moved to the second row of passengers.\nThere are two captain’s chairs in the second row. Another fine feature is a ceiling-mounted 30-inch monitor. The third-row seats could be power reclined to 150 degrees. The Galay M9 also offers a built-in 9.1-liter refrigerator and a Flyme Auto sound system. Its chassis adopts a dual-chamber air suspension.\nThe Galaxy M9 adopts the Geely EM Hybrid 2.0 system. It offers a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder for 161 hp paired with two electric motors. The combined power output of the system has yet to be revealed. CarNewsChina expects the M9 to adopt a similar system to the recently revealed Lynk & Co 10 EM-P from Geely. Its combined peak power reached 390 kW (523 hp). The Galaxy M9 will speed up to 100 km/h in 4.5 seconds. Its mixed range reaches 1,500 km.\nGeely Galaxy M9 price\nThe approximate price of the Geely Galaxy M9 was first revealed at the business conference held by Geely in China. It appeared that this vehicle would be priced at around 250,000 yuan (34,830 USD). At the presentation slide, the Geely Galaxy M9 was displayed as a cheaper sibling of the Lynk & Co 900 with a price of around 350,000 yuan (48,770 USD).\nIt is worth mentioning that the Lynk & Co 900 starts at 309,900 yuan (43,180 USD) in China. However, this vehicle has an approximate price level of 350,000 yuan in the slide. It hints that the Geely Galaxy M9 could start at 209,900 yuan (29,250 USD). In this case, the Galaxy M9 will easily become one of the cheapest players in the segment. This car will rival much pricier competitors with new energy powertrain options. We listed their starting prices below.\n- Li L9 – 409,800 yuan (57,100 USD)\n- GAC Hyptec HL – 269,800 yuan (37,600 USD)\n- Aito M9 – 469,800 yuan (65,460 USD)\n- Aito M8 – 359,800 yuan (50,130 USD)\n- Onvo L90 – 279,900 yuan (39,000 USD)\n- Lynk & Co 900 – 309,900 yuan (43,180 USD)\n- Deepal S09 – 229,900 yuan (31,030 USD)\n- Denza N9 – 389,800 yuan (54,330 USD)",
