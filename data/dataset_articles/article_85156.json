  "text": "Says 3.4B people using at least one of our apps each day. Says developing superintelligence, which it defines as AI that surpasses human intelligence in every way, is now in sight. Says established Meta Superintelligence Labs. Says making good progress towards LAMA 4.1 one and 4.2. Says Prometheus cluster is coming online next year, and thinks it’s going to be the world’s first gigawatt plus cluster. Says making these investments because we have conviction that superintelligence is going to improve every aspect of what the company does. Says continues to see strong momentum with Ray Ban Meta Glasses with sales accelerating. Says also launching new Performance AI glasses with the Oakley Meta HSTNs. Says thinks that AI glasses are going to be the main way people integrate superintelligence into day to day lives. Says seeing Meta AI become an increasingly valuable complement to content discovery engines. Says continues to see momentum with video engagement in particular. Says Instagram video time was up more than 20% year over year globally. Says expects talent additions across all of priority areas will continue to drive overall headcount growth through this year in 2026. Says a very high chance it seems like the world is going to look pretty different in a few years from now.
