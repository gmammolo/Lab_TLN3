  "text": "Developer Nihon Falcom has announced that the native PlayStation 5 ports of their action RPGs Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana and Ys IX: Monstrum Nox are now available in Japan. Fans can now benefit from boosted performance and visuals.\nHowever, saved data and DLC from the PlayStation 4 versions can’t be transferred to the PlayStation 5 versions. Publisher NIS America has already released the native PlayStation 5 versions of Ys VIII and Ys IX worldwide.\nMoreover, the enhanced re-release of Ys X: Nordics, Ys X: Proud Nordics, is now available on Nintendo Switch 2 in Japan. The game will be released for Nintendo Switch 2 and PC via Steam in Asia on August 21, 2025. Proud Nordics features various new story elements and gameplay features.\nYs VIII follows the legendary red-haired adventurer Adol Christin after he and the vessel he boards, the Lombardia, are attacked by a sea creature, causing a crash. Afterward, everyone becomes stranded on the elusive Isle of Seiren, which hosts a myriad of secrets tied to ancient civilization.\nCheck out our review of the Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana novelization, written by Anna Kashina and published by Dragonwell Publishing.\nThe game has sold over 700,000 units.\nWe reviewed the native PlayStation 5 port.\nYs IX: Monstrum Nox is currently the latest chronological entry in the franchise, where the series protagonist, Adol Christin, is 24 years old. It follows the red-haired hero as he becomes a captive in the prison city of Balduq. Adol quickly becomes a supernatural entity known as a Monstrum, and he allies with those also “gifted” with the power. The group gradually unveils truths regarding the Romun Empire.\nYs IX is the fourth game in the series to utilize the party combat system, meaning that characters other than Adol are playable. In addition, every party member has a specific attack attribute (Strike, Slash, and Pierce) that is highly effective against varying enemies. Further, this entry embraces exploration more than any previous game.\nCheck out our review of Ys IX: Monstrum Nox’s PlayStation 4 release.\nYs X: Proud Nordics features a new location north of Obelia Gulf. Amid battling Griegr, Adol and Karja reach this location, which is comprised of countless ruins.\nMoreover, the two encounter the new Shield Siblings, Canute and Astrid, from the Kingdom of Danmorc. Aland Island is where one of the arks from the final days of the Norgard Duchy washed ashore. Furthermore, Grimson Balta once surveyed this area as a potential base of operations.\nPlayers can anticipate new Cross Actions, Mana Actions, and bosses, as well as new implementations like Mana Ride races and arena battles. A 120 FPS performance mode will also be available.\nYs X: Nordics is available in the West. Check out our review.",
