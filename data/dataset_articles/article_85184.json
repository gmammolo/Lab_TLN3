  "text": "What the Tech: Study and Learn with ChatGPT\nThe school year is upon us, and with it, the familiar worries of homework, grades, and keeping up. For years, the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT has sparked a concern among teachers and parents: Will students simply bypass the learning process and have AI do their work for them?\nA new feature from ChatGPT, aptly named “Study and Learn,” may be a game-changer, not by doing the work for students, but by helping them to grasp the concepts.\n“Study and Learn” was released this week by OpenAI to act as a free and personalized tutor. It guides students through tough topics rather than just giving them the answers and doing the work.\nTo test it out, I told Chat GPT that I was an 8th-grade student and my teacher was covering the American Revolution and Samuel Adams.\nIt asked a few questions to find out what I already know about Adams. Then, it asked if I knew about the Sons of Liberty and the Boston Tea Party. When I said I didn’t, Study and Learn added a summary and then asked follow-up questions like a real person or tutor would.\nWhen I got a question wrong, it didn’t just give the correct answer, but explained what I missed.\nAnd when I asked Chat GPT to write a paper on Samuel Adams, it declined but offered to help me write it myself.\nWhen I shifted gears to change the subject to algebra, it asked for specifics on what kind of problems we were studying, and then helped me understand how to solve equations.\nThis isn’t to say that all students will suddenly stop trying to find shortcuts. But for the kids who genuinely want to learn, “Study and Learn” offers an invaluable resource. It’s the difference between scraping by with a passing grade and truly mastering a subject, leading to that coveted “A.” The best part? It’s completely free for registered ChatGPT users, with no premium subscription required.",
