  "text": "TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — National Pingtung University of Science and Technology unveiled an AI-powered agriculture laboratory Wednesday, equipped with advanced sensors and automated systems to promote the development of smart agriculture.\nUniversity Principal Chang Chin-lung (張金龍) said Taiwan Hipoint donated advanced equipment to help monitor crop conditions and promote agricultural automation. He expressed hope the lab will become one of Taiwan’s key centers for smart agriculture research, per CNA.\nChung Hsing-ying (鍾興穎), a professor in the Department of Plant Industry, said some of the lab’s equipment can simulate climate conditions and use special imaging technology to monitor plant growth.\nThe collected data is sent to an AI system, which automatically adjusts the greenhouse environment and refines planting methods. It can also analyze images and sensor data to forecast crop growth and detect potential pest or disease threats.\nChung added that the lab includes two artificial-light plant growth chambers, where light color and brightness, temperature, humidity, airflow, and carbon dioxide levels can all be adjusted to determine optimal growing conditions.\nIn July, the department hosted a free three-day greenhouse cultivation camp for students, offering hands-on lessons in electrical wiring, light installation, safety protocols, and basic soilless growing methods.\nIn June, the department participated in the Food Taipei Mega Shows, exhibiting its agricultural products and technologies. Highlights included herbal black tea bags and coffee, lemon peel-based pain relief patches and disinfectants, sugar-free sesame paste, and fish bone calcium supplements.\nThe university’s proximity to the Pingtung Agricultural Biotechnology Park and other agricultural ministry research centers supports its goal of becoming an R&D hub. It also partners with two Japanese universities to promote academic exchange and collaboration.",
