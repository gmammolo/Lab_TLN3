  "text": "The Internet Of Things (IOT) Drives Explosive Growth In The Soft Robotics Market: Pivotal Factor Influencing Soft Robotics Market Growth in 2025 07-31-2025 06:04 AM CET | Industry, Real Estate & Construction\nPress release from: The Business Research Company Soft Robotics Market\nUse code ONLINE30 to get 30% off on global market reports and stay ahead of tariff changes, macro trends, and global economic shifts\nSoft Robotics Market Size Growth Forecast: What to Expect by 2025?\nThe size of the soft robotics market has seen an exponential increase recently. Its growth is projected to increase from $1.84 billion in 2024 to $2.29 billion in 2025, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.4%. The advancements in the past can be credited to its wide-ranging applications in areas such as medical robotics and its versatility in handling and maneuvering. Other contributing factors include growing interest from defense and military sectors, consumer electronics, wearable robotics, and the use of automation in agriculture.\nHow Will the Soft Robotics Market Size Evolve and Grow by 2029?\nThe market size of soft robotics is anticipated to witness a steep rise in the forthcoming years. The growth is estimated to reach a staggering $5.76 billion by 2029, with a 26.0% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). This anticipated surge can be linked to the expansion in the food and beverage sector, environmental survey and exploration, international health, and safety concerns, standardization and commercialization, as well as custom solutions for specified uses. Key trends expected during the forecast period comprise bio-mimetic and bio-inspired designs, soft monitoring systems and feedback mechanisms, the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI), soft exoskeletons for human enhancement, and cooperative robots (cobots).\nView the full report here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/soft-robotics-global-market-report\nWhat Drivers Are Propelling the Growth of Soft Robotics Market Forward?\nPredicted advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) technology are anticipated to fuel the rise of the soft robotics market. IoT represents a connected framework of computational devices, mechanical instruments, and electronic machinery, each equipped with unique identities and can transfer data bypassing direct human involvement. Soft robotics utilizes IoT sensors to design breakthrough solutions that offer safety, adaptability, and enhanced human interaction, resulting in novel opportunities across various sectors including healthcare, automation, environmental surveillance and so forth. For instance, a report released by Sweden's telecommunications firm, Ericsson, in September 2022 revealed that global IoT connections multiplied to 13.2 billion in 2022, with a projected growth of 18% to 34.7 billion connections by 2028. Consequently, the growing adoption rate of IoT fuels the progress of the soft robotics market. A surge in the soft robotics market is expected due to governmental support and initiatives for robotic technologies, including soft robots. Governmental initiatives encompass the aid provided by government bodies to diverse organizations, industries, projects, programs or individuals at different jurisdictional levels. Several governmental authorities have launched initiatives to stimulate innovation in the integration of robotic technologies. An example of this can be seen in High Value Manufacturing Catapult, a company based in the UK. In July 2024, they reported that the government announced the Advanced Manufacturing Plan in November 2023, aiming to buttress the manufacturing sector with a targeted funding of £4.5 billion ($5.86 billion) over the next five years, starting in 2025, with focus on key sectors such as automotive. Hence, governmental support and initiatives targeted at robotics, including soft robots, act as a driving force for the growth of the soft robotics market.\nGet your free sample here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/sample.aspx?id=13160&type=smp\nWhich Emerging Trends Are Transforming the Soft Robotics Market in 2025?\nLeading enterprises in the soft robotics market are concentrating on crafting innovative technology such as soft exoskeleton technology-based robotic hand rehabilitation gloves to guarantee top-notch customer service. These new age robotic gloves, customized for people with hand disabilities, enable effective recovery and rehabilitation. For instance, Siyi Intelligence, a medical equipment manufacturer from China, introduced HRC12 in November 2022. HRC12 is an advanced version of SYREBO soft robotic hand rehabilitation gloves with enhanced soft exoskeleton technology for better usability and accessibility. The HRC12 suite offers comprehensive training modes including fine motor training, stretching mode, pinch training, amongst others, providing a more realistic set of training programs for specialized home-based rehabilitation services.\nWhat Are the Key Segments in the Soft Robotics Market?\nThe soft robotics market covered in this report is segmented -\n1) By Type: Soft Grippers, Cobots, Inflated Robots, Exoskeleton\n2) By Component: Hardware, Software\n3) By End User: Healthcare, Advanced Manufacturing, Food And Beverages, Logistics, Other End Users\nSubsegments:\n1) By Soft Grippers: Adaptive Grippers, Suction-Based Grippers\n2) By Cobots: Lightweight Cobots, Flexible Cobots\n3) By Inflated Robots: Soft Inflatable Structures, Pneumatic Robots\n4) By Exoskeletons: Wearable Exoskeletons, Robotic Exoskeletons For Rehabilitation\nTailor your insights and customize the full report here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/customise?id=13160&type=smp\nWho Are the Key Players Shaping the Soft Robotics Market's Competitive Landscape?\nMajor companies operating in the soft robotics market report are Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., Fanuc Corporation, Yaskawa Electric Corporation, Festo Group, Ocado Group PLC, QinetiQ Group plc., Ottobock SE & Co KGaA, SRI International Inc., Universal Robots, Piab Group Holding, SoftWear Automation Inc., Doosan Robotics Inc., Disney Research, Ekso Bionics Holdings Inc., Innophys Co.
