Whether facing athletic challenges or life’s adversities, true resilience lies not only in perseverance, but also in the ability to reset and rise again from setbacks. I resonate with the mental pressures faced by young people in Hong Kong today, and I'm grateful to be part of the ESG Gala to share my personal journey as an athlete. I hope to encourage the younger generation to care for themselves, prioritize their mental and emotional health, and boldly live out their true value in this ever-evolving world.”\nMs Kitty Poon, Founder of LoveXpress , said “We are deeply grateful for the collaboration with Champion REIT to organise this art exhibition, which provides a platform to showcase the works of young autistic artist, Alvin Li.
