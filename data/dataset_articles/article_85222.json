  "text": "Blue Ant Studios has joined forces with Toronto- and Calgary-based multimedia developer Titan1Studios to co-develop the first video game inspired by its 2D-animated YouTube series Armadillo Avalanche (pictured).\nThis is the first expansion move Blue Ant has made for the IP, which follows a tween girl rock band that uses the power of music to fight monstrous creatures in their town. AJ Trauth, Blue Ant’s VP of kids & family, YA and animation, told Playback ‘s sister publication Kidscreen that the company jumped on the opportunity to build a game with Titan1 and introduce Armadillo Avalanche to new interactive platforms and audiences.\n“This isn’t just a licensing play; it’s a strategic move to deepen engagement, grow awareness and create real-world traction for a series we believe has all the makings of a breakout hit,” says Trauth. “We already have five animated shorts, two hilarious scripts, fantastic designs and some kick-ass original music. But in an environment where buyers want to see momentum before committing, the video game acts as both creative expression and strategic signal.”\nThe Armadillo Avalanche action game will roll out on consoles and PCs next year, letting up to four players take on the persona of a different band member. Each character has chops on a different musical instrument, and as the game progresses, players will unlock more musical abilities and power-ups to beat up enemies in style.\nArmadillo Avalanche was produced with support from both the Shaw Rocket Fund and the Canada Media Fund, and it debuted on the marbleKids YouTube channel two years ago. So far, the IP has been relatively slow to build an audience, with its five shorts each netting about 10,000 views on average. But the game is expected to speed this up, according to a Blue Ant spokesperson.\nIn addition to its agreement with Blue Ant, Titan1 is collaborating with L.A.-based prodco Rideback to produce an all-ages animated adaptation of Mike Heneghan’s Zomben comic series, as well as working with its subsidiary Missing Socks Entertainment on the eco-themed CG-animated toon Welcome .\nThis story originally appeared in Kidscreen\nImage courtesy of Blue Ant Studios",
