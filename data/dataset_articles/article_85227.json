  "text": "First for online fashion retailer Oh Polly with launch of interactive PDPs as part of Soft Season collection\nOh Polly has notched up a company first with the roll-out of interactive product detail pages (PDPs) on its e-commerce site.\nIn a LinkedIn post, it said: “Exciting updates to share as our teams continue to push boundaries. We officially launched our first ever interactive PDPs as part of our ‘Soft Season ‘collection, allowing products to interact on our website, creating an immersive and dynamic storytelling experience.”\nIt added: “A huge well done to our teams for their visionary thinking and flawless execution in transforming a traditionally static touchpoint into a viral moment! We’re just getting started - stay tuned for more to come.”\nNibble\nEarlier this year, Oh Polly announced a new feature that lets customers haggle for lower prices with an AI chatbot named Nibble. The response was mixed.\nOne TikTok user shared her experience after successfully bargaining an extra 14% off her order. She purchased a dress originally priced at £175, marked down to £88 in a sale, and managed to get it further reduced to £76 through Nibble.\nHer video gained over 41k views, sparking discussion in the comments. One user wrote: “This just proves the price shouldn't have been what it was to start with in the first place”. While another said: “I’ve just done this! Got the Jailene dress down to £98 from £150”.\nA spokesperson for payments specialist Dojo commented: “AI chatbots like Nibble are likely to become more common on e-commerce sites, allowing customers to negotiate better deals while increasing the chances of conversion for retailers.”\nThey added: “Our research shows an average of 82,450 monthly Google searches for 'coupon codes' and 58,230 for 'discount codes'. Using AI to offer tailored discounts, without directing users away from the site, is just one example of how AI is being tested and implemented to help businesses increase sales.”\n\"The feature’s debut on Oh Polly sparked mixed reactions. Some shoppers welcomed the opportunity to save, while others were frustrated by price variations between customers. It will be interesting to see how retailers balance dynamic pricing with fairness, especially as this technology is still in its infancy and will require refinement over time.”\n2025 RTIH INNOVATION AWARDS\nOnline retail will be a key focus area at the 2025 RTIH Innovation Awards.\nThe awards, which are now open for entries, celebrate global tech innovation in a fast moving omnichannel world.\nOur 2024 hall of fame entrants were revealed during an event which took place at RIBA’s 66 Portland Place HQ in Central London on 21st November, and consisted of a drinks reception, three course meal, and awards ceremony presided over by comedian Lucy Porter.\nIn his welcome speech, Scott Thompson, Founder and Editor, RTIH, said: “The event is now into its sixth year and what a journey it has been. The awards started life as an online only affair during the Covid outbreak, before launching as a small scale in real life event and growing year on year to the point where we’re now selling out this fine, historic venue.”\nHe added: “Congratulations to all of our finalists. Many submissions did not make it through to the final stage, and getting to this point is no mean feat. Checkout-free stores, automated supply chains, immersive experiences, on-demand delivery, next generation loyalty offerings, inclusive retail, green technology. We’ve got all the cool stuff covered this evening.”\n“But just importantly we’ve got lots of great examples of companies taking innovative tech and making it usable in everyday operations - resulting in more efficiency and profitability in all areas.”\nCongratulations to our 2024 winners, and a big thank you to our sponsors, judging panel, the legend that is Lucy Porter, and all those who attended November's gathering.\nFor further information on the 2025 RTIH Innovation Awards, please fill in the below form and we will get back to you asap.",
