  "text": "Somebody out there has decided that the Ford Mustang Dark Horse – an already very powerful V8 performance car – is woefully underpowered. Weedy. Scrawny. Less pony car, more puny car.\nThat somebody has therefore given it a large injection of ‘watch this!’ to create what thine eyes have glazed over. It’s officially called the CS800DH, and it is the work of London-based car specialist Clive Sutton.\nYou know the name. That’s the chap responsible for any number of wildly overpowered Mustangs, and this one’s no different. Chiefly because Mr Sutton has fitted a giant 3.0-litre Whipple supercharger to the Dark Horse’s 5.0-litre V8 and turned everything up to 11.\\u0026nbsp;\nPower leaps tall buildings in a single bound, up from 447bhp to 788bhp – a 76 per cent increase for goodness sake! – while torque jumps up 61 per cent to 642lb ft. Naturally there’s a custom Borla cat-back exhaust to unleash Full Supercharged V8 Noise, along with a short-shifter for the manual gearbox, and lower, stiffer MagneRide suspension.\nIt’s also been driven through an ocean of carbon fibre and emerged with a new front splitter, side skirts, rear diffuser, new rear wing, bonnet and headlight surrounds all made out of the stuff. Slick wheels, too: a set of 20in bronzed Vossens wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport 4S rubber.\nInside, you’ll find special Recaros able to both heat and cool your terrified soul, some Alcantara, and a full retrim. You can of course choose whatever colour you desire for the leather and Alcantara.\nHence the price. Each CS800DH will cost from between £135,000-£165,000, though this price also adds a full Ford Performance and Clive Sutton three-year warranty. “Our customers love the Mustang and consistently turn to us to unleash its full performance capability,” said Sutton.\n“With 788bhp, the full Ford Performance warranty, a glorious supercharger whine and our bespoke exhaust, there’s nothing like the CS800DH Mustang.”",
