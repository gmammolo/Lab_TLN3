  "text": "A well-known crypto analyst, Chiefy (@0xChiefy), has sparked fresh excitement across X (Twitter) by claiming that a historic altseason is now beginning – and it could turn small investments into life-changing gains.\nIn a new thread posted just hours ago, Chiefy says we’re entering the next phase of the crypto cycle – the same kind that turned $150 into over $30,000 during the last bull run.\nAnd this time? He believes Bitcoin is on track for a mind-blowing $380,000 target… with low-cap altcoins following close behind.\nWhy Chiefy Thinks the Time Is Now\nAccording to Chiefy, crypto works in repeating cycles, typically every four years, and they’re easy to spot once you know what to look for. He says the current setup mirrors previous rallies where Bitcoin gains strength first, then hands the spotlight to altcoins.\nRight now, we’re in the phase where Bitcoin dominance starts to drop – and money rotates into low-cap coins. In other words, this is when altseason really begins.\nChiefy made over $100,000 during the last cycle using this strategy. This time around, he’s doubling down on several small-cap tokens he believes could deliver 200x or more in returns by September.\nThe Historic Altseason starts this week 🔥\n— Chiefy (@0xChiefy)\nIt’s the same pattern again, and this cycle[$BTC]will pump to $380K.\nAltcoins always follow the lead, and $150 in lowcaps now = $30,000 by September.\nHere’s my list of alts with 200–250x upside potential 🧵🔽[pic.twitter.com/68kw3dDtEi][July 30, 2025]\n10 Altcoins With 200x–250x Potential, According to Chiefy\nHere are the tokens he’s watching closely:\n1. $RIO – Realio Network\nA full-stack platform for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and digital securities.\nPrice: $0.26 | Market Cap: $46M\n2. $HNT – Helium\nA decentralized wireless network for IoT devices.\nPrice: $3.13 | Market Cap: $583M\n3. $SUI – Sui Network\nA high-speed Layer 1 blockchain designed for global adoption and developer-friendly applications.\nPrice: $3.71 | Market Cap: $12.8B\n4. $ONDO – Ondo Finance\nA leader in real-world asset tokenization and yield-bearing token infrastructure.\nPrice: $0.93 | Market Cap: $2.9B\n5. $BAND – Band Protocol\nA cross-chain oracle network bringing external data to smart contracts.\nPrice: $0.67 | Market Cap: $111M\n6. $RENDER – Render Network\nDecentralized GPU power for AI, 3D rendering, and digital creativity.\nPrice: $3.75 | Market Cap: $1.9B\n7. $THETA – Theta Network\nA blockchain-based platform for decentralized video delivery and streaming.\nPrice: $0.81 | Market Cap: $818M\n8. $S – Sonic\nAn ultra-fast EVM-compatible Layer 1 chain with over 10,000 TPS.\nPrice: $0.29 | Market Cap: $839M\n9. $FIL – Filecoin\nA decentralized storage network aiming to store the world’s most valuable data.\nPrice: $2.47 | Market Cap: $1.6B\n10. $JUP – Jupiter Exchange\nA DEX aggregator built for the Solana ecosystem, offering efficient token swaps.\nPrice: $0.51 | Market Cap: $1.5B\nChiefy’s predictions may sound bold, but they’re based on years of watching crypto patterns repeat.
