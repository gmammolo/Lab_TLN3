  "text": "What You Should Know:\n– Arkstone , a pioneer in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) -driven infectious disease clinical decision support and antimicrobial stewardship has been acquired by ARCHIMED , a private equity firm specializing in the healthcare sector. Financial details of the acquisition were not disclosed.\n– The acquisition marks a pivotal moment in Arkstone’s growth trajectory, positioning the company to expand its global footprint, deepen its R&D capabilities, and bring its precision-guided technology to more clinicians worldwide.\n– Backed by ARCHIMED’s capital, extensive healthcare expertise, and international reach, Arkstone is poised to scale its impact on the global fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR), one of the most urgent public health threats of our time.\nRedefining Infectious Disease Management with AI The global fight against antimicrobial resistance is a critical public health challenge. Arkstone’s flagship OneChoice Report leverages human-in-the-loop ML and AI to generate optimal infectious disease treatment recommendations. It achieves this by analyzing laboratory results alongside patient data, delivering patient-specific guidance to clinicians at the moment lab results are received. Already in use by laboratories across the United States and internationally, Arkstone is transforming how healthcare providers diagnose, treat, and understand infectious diseases.\nFollowing the acquisition, Arkstone will continue to operate with its existing team. The company’s next phase will focus on rapid growth, further product development, and entry into new markets.\n“Arkstone’s OneChoice Report is redefining infectious disease management. Our partnership will enable Arkstone to reach more markets, accelerate product innovation, and ultimately save lives by reducing the misuse of antibiotics,” said Igor Petricca, Partner at ARCHIMED. “This deal offers an additional dimension, as Clinical Decision Support software (CDS) and infectious disease are at the crossroads of hot subsectors of our Healthcare IT and Diagnostics franchises.”",
