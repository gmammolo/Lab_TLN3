The award recognizes AudioCodes’ collaboration with the University of Central Florida (UCF) to deliver a Microsoft Teams-based contact center at scale. The achievement in the Best CX Partnership category further highlights the growing Voca CIC partnership with AT&T Business to provide a market-centric, integrated UCaaS and CCaaS offering for Microsoft Teams.\nDan Miller, Emeritus Analyst and Founder of Opus Research and judge for the CX Awards, commented:\n“AudioCodes’ work with the University of Central Florida was particularly impressive due to its scale and complexity, consolidating over 40 helpdesks into a single, centralized contact center serving 70,000 students. The story also clearly outlined the economic benefits, demonstrated how its Microsoft Contact Center solution was tailored to the education sector, and featured compelling customer testimonials.”\n“The ease and speed to create a contact center from drawing to deployment has saved us hundreds of hours and months of planning,” said Keith Honaker, Lead UC and Head Architect of Contact Centers at UCF. “The scalability of Voca CIC assures us we can take on any project the University has. On top of that, the reliability - it has been such a stable product that we haven’t had any downtime.”\nIn addition to winning Best CX Deployment, AudioCodes was honored as Highly Commended in the Best CX Partnership category for its growing collaboration with AT&T Business around Voca CIC. This strategic partnership brings together AT&T Cloud Voice - supporting enterprise migrations to Microsoft Teams Phone along with Voca CIC, a native Microsoft Teams contact center solution designed for unified, AI-powered customer experience. As UCaaS and CCaaS integration accelerates across the industry, this joint offering is helping organizations simplify and modernize their customer engagement. The recognition from CX Today is a testament to the strength and momentum of this partnership.\nThis milestone builds on the recognition Voca CIC received in 2024 when it was named Best Microsoft Teams Contact Center Solution at the CX Awards. Voca CIC is certified for Microsoft Teams and built in Azure, leveraging Azure Communication Services and Teams Phone Extensibility to deliver scalable, AI-first CX across voice, chat, email, and SMS.\n“We’re thrilled to be recognized as an industry leader in the CX Awards for the second year in a row,” said Gidi Adlersberg, Head of the Voca CIC Business Line at AudioCodes. “Our 2024 win as Best Microsoft Teams Contact Center was a testament to our ability to build a powerful solution that makes a real impact. This year’s recognition is a natural evolution of that journey - proof that we not only have a great product, but also the strength to reliably deliver it at scale.”\nVoca CIC is available as a 30-day free trial on the AudioCodes website, Microsoft AppSource, or the Teams Store. New customers can build a conversational contact center in minutes, including AI and omnichannel features, along with a free phone number from AudioCodes for instant evaluation.",
