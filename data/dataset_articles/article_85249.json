  "text": "Fusion record\nThe energy supply of the future is at a crossroads. Fossil fuels are being phased out, climate change is putting political and technological systems under pressure, and traditional renewable energies alone are reaching their limits when it comes to base load capacity and storage problems. In this context, nuclear fusion is often seen as a savior – an almost inexhaustible, CO₂-neutral source of energy that neither leaves behind long-lasting radioactive waste nor carries the risks of traditional nuclear fission. But the road to this goal was and is rocky. For decades, the promise of fusion was considered “ready for the market in 30 years”, a running joke among physicists.",
