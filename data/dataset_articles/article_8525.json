  "text": "Off-duty firefighters initiate rescue of Colo. skier after 2,000 feet fall\nFirefighters in the Skywalker Couloir area saw the skier fall, called 911 and descended to reach the injured man\nBy Nicole Dorfman\nDaily Camera\nBOULDER COUNTY, Colo. — A skier was rescued on Sunday after sliding up to 2,000 feet while attempting to descend Skywalker Couloir.\nAccording to a release, at 10:37 a.m. Sunday, Boulder County Communications was notified of a skier who had sustained serious injuries in the area of Skywalker Couloir on South Arapahoe Peak west of Nederland.\nThe 47-year-old man was beginning a ski descent of the couloir when he fell, sliding and tumbling around 1,000 to 2,000 feet down on the snowfield before coming to a stop at a rock ledge.\nTwo off-duty firefighters recreating in the area witnessed the fall and were able to call 911, according to the release. They also descended to where the injured man had stopped and were able to provide first aid and relay information to the responding rescue teams.\nAccording to the release, rescuers and medical personnel from Rocky Mountain Rescue Group were flown near the scene by MedEvac before climbing the rest of the way to the scene.\nThey were also assisted by other bystanders who helped carry equipment to the scene and additional rescuers hiked in from the Fourth of July Trailhead bringing additional equipment.\nRescuers were able to place the skier in a full-body vacuum splint, and he was hoisted from the scene and transported by helicopter to Nederland Middle and Senior High School. The skier was then transported by ambulance to a local hospital.\nAccording to the release, the skier sustained serious injuries but “remained stable throughout the incident.”\nAssisting agencies involved with this rescue effort include the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office, Boulder County Parks and Open Space, Nederland Fire Protection District, the Rocky Mountain Rescue Group, the Colorado Search and Rescue Association, the Colorado Hoist Rescue Team, MedEvac, and American Medical Response.\n(c)2024 the Daily Camera (Boulder, Colo.)\nVisit the Daily Camera (Boulder, Colo.) at www.dailycamera.com\nDistributed by\nTribune Content Agency, LLC.",
