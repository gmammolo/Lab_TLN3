  "text": "BlockDAG isn’t just claiming growth, it’s showing real signs of it. With major partnerships across international sports teams and a presale that’s now brought in $356 million over 29 batches, the project is standing out for what it’s doing, not just what it’s saying. These moves are gaining traction, and not without reason.\nMore than 24.5 billion BDAG have already been sold, and the presale window before the August 11 price change is seeing growing demand. The rate is fixed at $0.0016 until then, giving new buyers the chance to see a projected 3025% return when BDAG lists at $0.05.\nFrom global sponsorships to platform upgrades, BlockDAG is making a case as the best crypto pick ahead of the next price jump.\nSports Partnerships Help BlockDAG Reach New Audiences Crypto ads are everywhere, but BlockDAG is taking a different path. Instead of short campaigns, it’s committing to long-term sponsorships across major sports, aimed at connecting with fans beyond traditional crypto circles.\nThe partnership with Inter Milan opened doors to a massive international football audience. In the U.S., BlockDAG teamed up with the Seattle Seawolves, a top-tier rugby team, and the Seattle Orcas, a prominent cricket team.\nThese deals aren’t just about name-dropping, they’re aimed at communities in regions where crypto is picking up steam. With another U.S.-based sports deal reportedly in the pipeline, it’s clear that BlockDAG is playing the long game by building trust with new global users.\nAnd the approach is working. These sponsorships are helping bring more users into the BDAG ecosystem and boosting interest worldwide.\nEarly Buyers Get 3025% ROI Chance Until August 11 BlockDAG’s presale has delivered some big numbers. So far, $356 million raised, 24.5 billion BDAG coins sold, and over 18,880 mining devices distributed.\nHere’s the important detail, anyone buying in now secures the $0.0016 rate, which remains in place until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. After that, the price will gradually climb back to $0.05, offering early supporters the potential for a 3025% gain.\nWith a final presale goal of $600 million, BlockDAG is moving fast toward its target. Unlike many crypto names that rely on hype, this one is moving with clear benchmarks and progress.\nIt’s not just the price angle that stands out. BlockDAG has passed a CertiK audit, is expanding its development network, and is lined up for listings on 20 exchanges after launch. That combination of traction, pricing, and solid infrastructure makes it a strong option for those watching for the best crypto pick this season.\nMajor User Growth & App Updates Strengthen BDAG’s Position There’s more happening here than just partnerships and fundraising. BlockDAG is evolving its platform based on what the community actually wants.\nAfter a flood of user messages, BlockDAG chose to extend the Beat Vesting Pass, offering full access to BDAG coins right at launch. No delays. No waiting periods. That’s a sharp contrast from how most projects handle vesting, and the community has responded positively.\nThe X1 mining app also passed a major milestone, now with over 2.5 million users mining BDAG directly from their phones without needing extra hardware. It’s making crypto mining accessible to the average person, and the numbers show people are jumping on board.\nOn top of that, BlockDAG ran a full live demonstration of its X1 and X10 miners. The goal was simple: show the technology in real-time, proving the system’s efficiency and low energy use. It wasn’t about creating hype, it was about showing the tech is ready.\nThe user dashboard also received a major update. With a wallet, leaderboard, real-time transactions, and news features all in one place, it’s become a central hub that’s easier to navigate and use. These tools aren’t just extras, they help users earn, engage, and stay active.\nFinal Thoughts While many projects are still trying to build momentum, BlockDAG is hitting clear targets. Between global sports sponsorships and a massive presale haul, this project is checking all the right boxes.\nWith big-name partnerships through Inter Milan, the Seattle Seawolves, and Seattle Orcas, BlockDAG is breaking into new markets. At the same time, strong figures, like $356 million raised, 24.5 billion coins sold, and a 3025% potential return, are giving experienced crypto users a reason to pay attention.\nAs the August 11 deadline for the $0.0016 price approaches and the $0.05 launch draws closer, this might be one of the clearest opportunities on the table. For those searching for the best crypto pick right now, BlockDAG makes a strong case.\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu",
