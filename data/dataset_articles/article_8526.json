  "text": "Thalapathy Vijay calls off his birthday celebration; urges fans to help Kallakurichi victims Thalapathy Vijay, the renowned South Indian actor, is celebrating his 50th birthday on June 22, while fans have made some massive arrangements to celebrate the special birthday of their favorite actor. But, Thalapathy Vijay has called off his birthday celebration following the Kallakurichi incident. For those who are unaware, over 40 people died by consuming illicit liquor in Kallakurichi town in Tamil Nadu, and the unfortunate incident has saddened the entire state. To mourn the demise of Kallakurichi victims and to avoid celebrations during the tragic time, Vijay has called off his birthday celebrations outside theatres and asked fans to aid their support to the families of Kallakurichi victims. Vijay fan club President Bussy Anand has made the official announcement of the birthday celebration cancellation on his social media to send a strong message to fans ahead of the popular actor&#039;s 50th birthday. Yesterday, (Jun 20) Vijay condemned the Tamil Nadu government for their negligence over the sale of illicit liquor through a social media message. Following the statement on social media, Vijay went to Kallakurichi to share his condolences with the families of deceased people and met people, who are under treatment at the hospital. Vijay will be next seen on big screens in &#039;GOAT&#039;, which is directed by Venkat Prabhu, and the film is scheduled to release in theatres on September 5. Multiple updates from &#039;GOAT&#039; are also arriving for Vijay&#039;s birthday, and fans are set to rock with their online celebration. For more news like this visit TOI.
