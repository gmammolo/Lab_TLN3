  "text": "OpenAI has nearly doubled its annualised revenue to US$12 billion in the first seven months of 2025, according to The Information, which cited a source familiar with the matter. The figure suggests the Microsoft-backed firm is generating about US$1 billion a month, with ChatGPT products reportedly drawing around 700 million weekly active users across consumer and business segments.\nReuters said it could not immediately verify the report, while OpenAI declined to comment.\nThe report added that OpenAI has raised its projected cash burn for 2025 to about US$8 billion, an increase of US$1 billion from earlier estimates.\nMeanwhile, the company is lining up investors for the second tranche of its US$30 billion funding round, with shareholders Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management expected to invest hundreds of millions of dollars. Investors, including Japan’s SoftBank, are reportedly close to securing US$7.5 billion in commitments for this phase.\nSoftBank’s total agreed investment in OpenAI has reached US$32 billion since its initial backing in late 2024.",
