  "text": "Beskrivning\nLand | Norge |\n---|---|\nLista | Oslo Bors |\nSektor | Råvaror |\nIndustri | Olja & gas |\nNscale, Aker and OpenAI to establish Stargate Norway: a 100,000 NVIDIA GPU AI Gigafactory powered by renewable energy in Northern Norway\n2025-07-31 07:00:05\nIn a landmark partnership, Stargate Norway plans to deliver renewable-powered,\nsovereign AI infrastructure, marking OpenAI's first gigafactory initiative in\nEurope\nOslo, Norway - 31 July 2025 - Nscale Global Holdings Ltd. (\"Nscale\"), Aker ASA\n(\"Aker\") and OpenAI today announced the launch of Stargate Norway: an advanced\nAI infrastructure project in Narvik, Northern Norway. Powered entirely by\nrenewable energy, the facility will target to deliver 100,000 NVIDIA GPUs by the\nend of 2026, with ambitions to scale significantly in the years ahead. Stargate\nNorway will be designed to provide secure, scalable, and energy-efficient\ninfrastructure for sovereign AI workloads across Europe, fully aligned with\nEuropean regulatory frameworks. The initiative is led by global AI\ninfrastructure provider Nscale, in partnership with Aker and OpenAI.\nStargate Norway is planned to deliver 230MW of capacity, with ambitions to\nexpand by an additional 290MW - positioning it among the most significant AI\ninfrastructure investments in Europe. The project marks OpenAI's first data\ncentre initiative on the continent and the inaugural European site under its\n\"OpenAI for Countries\" programme.\nThe facility will be located in Kvandal, just outside Narvik - a region\ncharacterised by abundant hydropower, low local electricity demand, and limited\ntransmission capacity. These conditions result in power prices well below the\nEuropean average, complemented by a cool climate and established industrial\ninfrastructure, making Narvik an ideal location for large-scale data\noperations.\nStargate Norway is projected to generate significant activity and a long-term\noperational presence in the Narvik region. The project will also collaborate\nwith local and regional academic institutions to advance AI research and\ndevelopment, supporting the growth of regional expertise and innovation in\nNorthern Norway.\n\"Announcing Stargate Norway and delivering one of the first European AI\nGigafactory to market is a strategic milestone for the region and boosts its\nrole in the global AI landscape,\" said Josh Payne, CEO of Nscale. \"Sovereign,\nscalable and sustainable infrastructure is now essential to remain competitive.\nWe're proud to partner with Aker, drawing on the team's extensive experience and\nimpressive track record, to deliver a new generation of AI economic and\nproductivity growth in Europe. Together, we are combining OpenAI's leading\nmodels with Nscale's vertically integrated AI cloud, to provide the sustainable\ninfrastructure necessary to support public benefit, build industrial resilience\nand enable long-term regional innovation.\"\nThe site will be designed and built by Nscale, leveraging its experience in\ndelivering sovereign-grade AI infrastructure across Europe. It will be owned by\na 50/50 joint venture between Nscale and Aker, to be formed through wholly owned\nsubsidiaries of Aker following the planned merger with Aker Horizons. Completion\nof the joint venture is subject to agreed-upon closing conditions.\nIn parallel, Nscale and Aker will begin preparatory steps and mobilise resources\nfor construction activities. Both parties have committed approximately USD 1\nbillion to the initial 20MW phase of the project, including upwards of USD 250\nmillion in equity on a 100% basis, where each partner will contribute equally.\nThe Kvandal site alone has the potential to scale tenfold in future phases as\ncustomer contracts are secured. OpenAI welcomes the opportunity to be an initial\nofftaker with the option to scale over time under its \"OpenAI for Countries\"\nprogramme.\n\"Norway has a proud history of turning clean, renewable energy into industrial\nvalue, powering global industries like aluminium and fertiliser,\" said Øyvind\nEriksen, President & CEO of Aker. \"Today, artificial intelligence and advanced\ndata operations represent the next wave of value creation. Northern Norway, with\nits surplus of clean energy, available capacity, and industrial readiness, is\nthe ideal launchpad for this transformation. With Stargate Norway, we're\ncreating new jobs, activity, and long-term opportunities in Narvik and the\nregion. For Aker, this is a natural evolution of our industrial platform. As\ndata centres shift from cost centres to value-generating assets, Norway's energy\nadvantage becomes a catalyst for the next generation of digital industry. We're\nproud to help drive this development alongside Nscale, OpenAI, and local\nstakeholders.\"\n\"Europe needs more compute to realize the full potential of AI for all Europeans\n- from developers and researchers to startups and scientists - and we want to\nhelp make that happen,\" said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. \"I've always said we'd\nlove to bring Stargate to Europe if the conditions are right, and we think we've\nfound that in Narvik with clean, affordable energy, ideal climate, and great\npartners in Nscale and Aker. Stargate Norway will help provide the compute power\nto drive the next wave of AI breakthroughs and economic progress for Europe, in\nEurope.\"\nThe consortium behind Stargate Norway has made long-term sustainability a core\nprinciple of the project. The facility will run entirely on renewable power and\nis expected to incorporate closed-loop, direct-to-chip liquid cooling to ensure\nmaximum cooling efficiency. Additionally, excess heat from the GPU systems will\nbe made available to support low-carbon enterprises in the region.\nAs OpenAI customers, Aker and Nscale will benefit from local access to models\nand AI services delivered via sovereign infrastructure. They will also offer\npriority access to Norway's AI ecosystem, enabling homegrown startups and\nresearchers to leverage world-class compute resources. Surplus capacity is\nexpected be made available to public and private sector users across the UK,\nNordics, and Northern Europe, supporting regional demand and contributing to the\nbroader development of Europe's AI ecosystem.\nAn announcement video featuring remarks from Sam Altman (OpenAI), Øyvind Eriksen\n(Aker), Josh Payne (Nscale), and Jensen Huang (NVIDIA) is now available.
