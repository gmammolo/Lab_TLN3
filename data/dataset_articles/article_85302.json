Proportionate revenues and project-level EBITDA were USD 6.1 million and USD 4.4 million, respectively, compared to H1 2024 values of USD 6.1 million and USD 3.9 million. Project EBITDA margins improved from 64% to 73%, mainly driven by strong contributions from its projects in El Salvador and Mexico.\nThe increases were achieved despite operating fewer projects than in 2024. The Company sold its operating CHP plant in Puerto Rico at the end of last year. Consequently, on a like-for-like basis, the displayed growth is significantly more substantial.\n“We are very happy with the performance of our portfolio during the first six months of this year”, said Stefan H.A. Meichsner, Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer of MPCES. “The margin improvements in particular stand out as an excellent achievement. Given our lower overhead spending, these project-level improvements translate directly to higher profits on group level.”\nMPCES reported a consolidated group EBITDA of USD 2.2 million for the reporting period (H1 2024: USD 1.7 million).\nConstruction in Guatemala completed, but operational start delayed\nThe Company completed the construction of its largest project to-date, the 66 MWp solar PV plant San Patricio in Guatemala, in early July. MPCES is now waiting for permits to commence and conclude the testing phase, after which commercial operation of the project will officially begin.\nWhile the permitting process was expected to be concluded at the same time as the construction, the responsible authorities are taking longer than expected to issue the permits.\nYear-end guidance unchanged\nThe delay in Guatemala does currently not affect the Company’s year-end outlook, as the previously shared guidance for 2025 was confirmed. Revenues for this year are expected to be between USD 12 and 13 million, and project-level EBITDA between USD 9 and 9.5 million.\n“Despite the delay in commencing the testing phase of our project in Guatemala, we do not expect a negative impact on our full-year guidance, as a delay in revenue generation is currently being compensated by the contribution from our Colombian projects, which were originally not included in the 2025 outlook at all”, added Meichsner.\nFinancial results\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary and unaudited financial results for H1 2025 compared to H1 2024:\nin thousand USD unless stated otherwise, negative values in “()” | ||\nProportionate financials, H1 2025 vs. H1 2024 | ||\nH1 2025 | H1 2024 | |\nRevenue | 6,059 | 6,104 |\nProject EBITDA | 4,409 | 3,889 |\nGroup EBITDA | 2,518 | 2,031 |\nConsolidated financials, H1 2025 vs. H1 2024 | ||\nH1 2025 | H1 2024 | |\nRevenue | 5,427 | 5,544 |\nProject EBITDA | 4,074 | 3,508 |\nGroup EBITDA | 2,246 | 1,650 |\nGroup EBIT | 225 | (534) |\nNet income / (loss) | (1,431) | (4,621) |\nEPS (basis and diluted), in USD | (0.06) | (0.21) |\nTotal assets | 128,356 | 131,168 |\nEquity ratio | 37% | 50% |\nConsolidated cash position | 11,337 | 23,284 |\nFree cash position | 2,186 | 4,248 |\nMPC Energy Solutions – Invitation to webcast – H1 2025 Results\nA webcast for the investment community will be held today, 31 July 2025 at 10:00 CET.
