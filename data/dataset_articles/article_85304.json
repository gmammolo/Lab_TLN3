  "text": "A New Benchmark for Trust, Speed, and Unmatched Quality in Supplement Manufacturing\n(PRUnderground) July 30th, 2025\nGummi World, a full-service nutraceutical and OTC manufacturer and subsidiary of Intiva Health, has officially earned more third-party certifications than any other gummy manufacturer in the United States. This achievement cements its position as a new industry standard in verified quality, product safety, and operational excellence.\nWith certifications spanning dietary supplements, sports safety, OTC drug production, gluten-free and non-GMO verification, Gummi World now leads the industry in both the number and rigor of verified credentials, including:\nNSF/ANSI 455-2 cGMP Certification NSF Certified for Sport® NSF Health Sciences Certification Program (HSCPC) NSF/ANSI 455-4 OTC Drug Manufacturing NSF Costco Product Certification Non-GMO Project Verified GFCO Gluten-Free Certification USP Certified USDA Organic Certified Gluten-Free Certification FSPCA Certification With more audits underway Each certification reflects a distinct compliance area, requiring rigorous facility inspections, ongoing monitoring, and formula-level scrutiny. Together, they represent a culture of discipline, transparency, and unrelenting quality.\n“Certifications represent more than just compliance or checkboxes for us. They reflect a commitment to doing things right, every step of the way,” said Alexander C. Candelario, Chairman and CEO of Intiva Health. “They hold us accountable to the highest standards and push us to continuously improve our processes, products, and partnerships. For Gummi World, these credentials are proof points that we’re not just manufacturing gummies, but we’re building trust, safety, and transparency into every batch. That’s what our clients deserve, and it’s what motivates us to keep raising the bar.”\nCertifications That Open Doors\nThese credentials do more than satisfy regulations. They unlock new markets, support credible claims, and build consumer confidence. Whether selling through top retailers like Costco, supplying professional sports nutrition, or catering to consumers with dietary restrictions, Gummi World’s certification portfolio is a key competitive advantage.\n“The best brands in the world don’t settle. Neither do we,” added Candelario. “This level of certification gives our clients flexibility, credibility, and speed all at once.”\nFive Audits Within One Week\nGummi World’s certifications aren’t a one-off achievement; they reflect a rigorous, ongoing quality strategy. Recently, the company passed five major audits in a single week, including recertifications for NSF Certified for Sport® and cGMP (455-2), along with a new Gluten-Free Certification from GFCO. This readiness is embedded in every layer of the operation.\nAt its FDA-registered facility in Chandler, Arizona, Gummi World manages formulation, testing, manufacturing, packaging, and regulatory compliance under one roof. This vertical integration enables fast, consistent, and traceable production.\nBuilt for Brands That Expect More\nFrom OTC drug gummies to performance supplements and clean-label wellness products, Gummi World equips modern brands with expert product development, unmatched speed to market, and the certification depth to back it all up.\nLooking ahead, additional certifications are underway, and Gummi World is investing in new equipment to accelerate turnaround times while maintaining rigorous compliance. Whether expanding dosage forms or scaling up faster for emerging brands, the company’s next chapter is already in motion.\nLearn more about Gummi World’s industry-leading certifications and capabilities and request a product quote at www.gummiworld.com.\nAbout Gummi World\nIntiva Health is revolutionizing the health of healthcare through technology, compliance, and wellness innovation.
