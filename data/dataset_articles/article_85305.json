  "text": "DRIVING OUR ENERGY FUTURE SERIES : Australia is at a turning point in its consumer energy trajectory – boasting over four million solar homes, thousands of batteries now being installed every week, and the exciting potential of vehicle-to-grid technology just beginning to be realised.\nSpinifex is an opinion column. If you would like to contribute, contact us to ask for a detailed brief.\nBy aggregating the shared energy potential of these assets and leveraging AI smarts to control loads and outputs in response to the needs of the grid, virtual power plants (VPPs) have enormous potential to completely reshape how we generate, use, and share electricity – now and into the future.\nIn fact the Australian Energy Market Operator models that by 2030, 60 per cent of consumer storage capacity will be “coordinated” – requiring a huge uptick in VPP uptake as well as rapid progress towards Australia’s target of one million batteries.\nAEMO ISP 2024 Integrated System Plan: Report Charts Data – Comparison of required installed coordinated vs passive consumer storage capacity under the lowest cost pathway to Net Zero by 2050 (Step Change scenario). Current opportunities To be eligible for a 30 per cent rebate under the Albanese government’s landmark Cheaper Home Batteries Program , consumer storage assets are required to be “VPP-ready” – although households are not required to join one.\nVPPs risk becoming stranded policy ideas – technically brilliant, socially brittle\nSmart Energy Council On 1 July, the NSW government ended its battery incentive but increased its VPP incentive , offering between $400 to $1,500 to households who sign up to a registered VPP provider.\nThe Western Australia Residential Battery Scheme offers Western Australians a rebate and no-interest loan as part of that can be stacked with the federal rebate to unlock even greater savings – but only if they connect the battery to a VPP.\nThe Western Australia Residential Battery Scheme offers Western Australians a rebate and no-interest loan as part of that can be stacked with the federal rebate to unlock even greater savings – but only if they connect the battery to a VPP.\nSouth Australia’s virtual power plant is the country’s largest VPP. All households – including Housing SA and community housing tenants – can sign up to join through either AGL or Energy Locals. Under this government program, select households can also benefit from a Tesla PowerWall being installed at their property at no cost.\nWith over 1,000 battery installations every day since the federal rebate program went live, there is a huge opportunity to scale up VPP connectivity in NSW, WA and across the nation –but only if we get things right.\nConsumer energy resources (CER) promise direct savings to consumers, reduced energy costs and faster emissions reduction. But without proper regulation there is no guarantee that the full cost saving benefit to households will be realised, and consumer trust is already proving to be fragile. The Smart Energy Council has echoed these concerns , saying that “VPPs risk becoming stranded policy ideas – technically brilliant, socially brittle.”\nHow can VPPs be designed to be consumer centric? Amber Electric is one of the few providers with a truly consumer centred approach. Their model allows households to retain full control over their batteries and access higher earnings by selling their excess power at wholesale market rates. Customers can opt in or out at any time with no lock-in contracts and are guaranteed full transparency over how their energy is being used throughout the network.\nVPP provider Energy Locals is currently working with Deakin University to trial a virtual energy network that enables consumers without solar or a battery to sign up. This revolutionary new product could be a gamechanger for renters and apartment residents who are locked out of the benefits of CER.\nThese examples set a precedent for consumer-centric design, because they allow battery owners to:\nUnderstand exactly how and when their assets are controlled Retain the right to override decisions made by the VPP provider See a clear, fair return on their investment VPPs that do not meet this criteria raise serious concerns about consent, transparency, and consumer benefit.\nWhat needs to happen? Dr Gabrielle Kuiper, energy policy advisor and expert, has urged regulators to step up in response to concerns over the VPP market:\n“The Australian Energy Regulator should already be providing clear, accessible information on VPP products – integrating them into the Energy Made Easy comparator tool. These products have been around for years, and the AER has a legislative duty to support consumer choice.”\n“The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) must also require consistent disclosure of VPP contract terms and the profit split. We need a transparent, minimum revenue share for household energy users – I suggest 50% as a starting point.”\nSolar Citizens is calling for urgent action to establish these standards and protections. The Australian Energy Regulator has already recommended a package of reforms to modernise the National Energy Customer Framework to better cover emerging services like VPPs. The federal government’s Consumer Energy Resources (CER) Roadmap includes steps to make these protections enforceable and consistent, which are yet to be rolled out.\nThese reforms can’t come soon enough. If governments don’t act quickly, we risk replicating the same centralised, profit-driven energy system that VPPs were supposed to disrupt. Instead of empowering consumers, they could entrench the market dominance of major retailers.\nDone right, VPPs can help democratise our energy system. They can turn homes into active participants in the grid, bring down bills, and share the benefits of clean energy with renters, apartment dwellers, and social housing tenants. But to get there, we need transparency, fairness, and enforceable consumer rights – so VPPs actually work for the people powering them, not the profits of big energy retailers.\nCharlie Rodrick, Solar Citizens Charlie Rodrick, national campaigner, Solar Citizens More by Charlie Rodrick, Solar Citizens",
