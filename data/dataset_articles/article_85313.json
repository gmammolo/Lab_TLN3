  "text": "Chemotherapy response in colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibits significant heterogeneity, with current clinical predictors failing to capture complex genomic determinants of resistance. We developed a hybrid deep learning framework integrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks to analyze whole-genome somatic mutations, evolutionary conservation, chromatin accessibility, and 3D genome architecture in 2,546 TCGA patients. An attention mechanism identified predictive genomic regions. The model achieved an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89–0.94) in cross-validation and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91) in independent validation, outperforming clinical models (ΔAUC = +0.18, p <0.001). Key predictors included non-coding variants in TP53, KRAS, and PIK3CA regulatory regions. Triple-positive patients (mutations in all 3 regions) had significantly worse progression free survival (HR = 4.7, p < 0.001). Our framework enables accurate chemotherapy response prediction and reveals novel non-coding resistance mechanisms, advancing precision oncology in CRC.",
