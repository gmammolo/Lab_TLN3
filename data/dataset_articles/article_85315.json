  "text": "Cummins Inc. has announced the launch of its new Fuel System designed specifically to meet the diverse needs of non-road, off-highway applications. This latest innovation from Cummins Components and Software (CCS), a part of Cummins’ Components business unit, aims to deliver performance, scalability and integration, setting a new standard in fuel system technology.\nThe new Fuel System is designed with the customer in mind, with a wide range of engine platforms, ensuring smooth integration and optimal performance. The Fuel System is designed for seamless integration with customers' engine offerings. The pairing of the common rail system hardware with specific Fuel Systems controls caters to various off-highway applications such as construction, mining and power generation. The system has the potential to be applied across other engine ratings with minor fuel system tailoring on the pump, injector and rail. Furthermore, the system’s adaptable design enables it to be used in other industrial sectors.\nCummins has made significant improvements to the common rail Fuel Systems to ensure better performance, fuel economy and durability. The system also boasts rail pressure up to 2200 bar and with built-in protection up to 2600 bar, while the high-capacity pump delivers high flow rates over 500 pph (pounds per hour) at 1800 bar.\nThe Fuel System is built on Cummins’ proven heavy-duty Oil Lubricated Pump (OLP) platform, which brings years of production experience and field validation. This makes the system highly reliable and capable of meeting durability targets of up to 20,000 hours, depending on application duty cycles.\nCustomer-focused design is at the core of the Fuel Systems development at Cummins. The new Fuel System enables customers to meet stringent leading and lagging emissions standards (Stage 2, Tier 4, and global emissions), while enhancing performance and fuel economy. The system's critical pump components, such as Low Pressure Pump (LPP) and Inlet Metering Valve (IMV), are all serviceable.\nDeveloped through global collaboration across teams in the United States, India and China, the system will be manufactured at a Cummins facility with cutting edge sub-micron machining and world class cleanliness. The new Fuel System products are expected to be available later in 2025.",
