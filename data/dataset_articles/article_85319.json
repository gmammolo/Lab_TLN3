  "text": "IT is vital that communication be provided to our people of South Fly District as well as other parts of the country in rural areas, said PNG DataCo managing director Paul Komboi.\nMr Komboi made this statement during the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between DataCo and the South Fly District on Tuesday.\n“This project will see the erection of communal towers mainly across the district and its more than an infrastructure, I think it symbolises inclusion and an opportunity for every citizen of South Fly,” he said.\nPNG DataCo model, is to build towers in areas where there’s no coverage or very little coverage.\nAnd in building a communal tower. Communal meaning that it’s not built by a mobile operator, where it’s only used by them. So, our model is that we build a tower in a place where there’s no coverage by someone who is not a mobile operator, and that can be shared by the mobile operator.”\nHe said it takes a two-hour boat ride from Daru up the river to Oriomo and 40km journey to Wipim, we are painting a picture of connectivity that reaches even the most remote communities, this journey is a joint partnership we embrace and set responsibility and ownership and the management of the infrastructure, mainly the tower.\n“So, we look forward in welcoming mobile operators, mainly Digicel, Telikom or Vodafone to come and put up your base stations as well as radio operators, or broadcasters and TV to establish an arrangement with the DDA as well as DataCo to get 4G, or television, or radio services to our people.\n“Mainly to access information for education, and health purpose and economic opportunities as well as, commercial just to mention a few.\n“Let this agreement now, be the testament of us working together for the purpose and the vision of our people for South Fly and PNG,” said Mr Komboi.\nMember for South Fly and Minister for Livestock Sekie Agisa said, the people back in his district are in need of the communication services even, 90-95 percent is covered by Digicel but we need a bit of areas that we need DataCo to come in and erect the towers.\nHe said: “I believe where our district HQ is moving is very poor in receiving the Digicel Network and Provincial Administration has been pushing our district officers to move in there when our infrastructure is not ready for our district HQ.”\nHe added that with the signing of the MOU, they can now pave the way for the people and the officers at the district headquarters to carry out their duties and be connected with the rest of the country.\n“Daru is an island and some other infrastructures that are not in place, communication can be one especially if we have to deal with treasury we need communication, there are some things that are not in place, and the MOU signing will pave way for us to advance our district headquarters across our disconnected area, which is within the inland zone.”\nHe thanked DataCo for coming on board with them on the project, “to my understanding the first was with the Wau-Waria district and we want to do the same and link our people with the rest of the country and the world too”.",
