  "text": "Propel Software, creator of a product value management (PVM) platform, makes available its Summer 2025 release. The second of three major software releases in 2025 delivers automation with workflows that streamline daily tasks for enhanced efficiency, the company says.\nPropel’s summer release simplifies addressing notifications by applying a user-driven focus, with alerts delivered into daily workstreams to boost collaboration and ensure real-time, expedited response times, according to Propel Software. Its Notifications app gives users a single place to monitor notification needs, troubleshoot issues, and keep track of activity. Users canadd or remove recipients for specific actions and access a clear log of all messages sent.\n“At Propel we are consistently analyzing market needs and consulting with customers to influence future capabilities,” says Eric Schrader, chief product officer, Propel. “Our summer release prioritizes delivering value in tools where our customers already work so they can take action without leaving their current workflow, increasing business efficiency and productivity.“\nPropel’s templatized lifecycle phases automate current workflows, eliminating customization, according to the company. Providing approvers and groupings throughout the process, product companies can tap experts when needed to prevent rework of change orders each time an approver is added.\nPropel’s Admin Audit Trail gives enterprises clear visibility into key changes, helping to track governance around upgrades, process changes, and compliance-related actions, the company notes. Its low code/no code platform enables users to adapt to changing business regulations by modifying existing applications, or creating new ones. New capabilities track all lifecycle updates and approval criteria, while monitoring changes related to categories.\nPropel also expanded Component Insights reporting. Powered by SiliconExpert, a provider of supply chain insights, Propel’s new integrated reports and dashboards alert users to component issues for real-time decision making, aiding product design, quality, supply chain, and production.\nThe latest Propel Software release is now available for new and existing customers.\nSources: Press materials received from the company and additional information gleaned from the company’s website.\nDE's editors contribute news and new product announcements to Digital Engineering.
