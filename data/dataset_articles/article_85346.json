The market is expected to increase from $4.36 billion in 2024 to $4.58 billion in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.9%. Factors contributing to the growth during the historic period include the rising incidence of cancer, the demand for less invasive surgical procedures, increment in funding for medical robot research, and improvement in global healthcare infrastructure.\nWhat's the Long-Term Growth Forecast for the Radiosurgery And Radiotherapy Robotics Market Size Through 2029?\nIn the forthcoming years, the market size of radiosurgery and radiotherapy robotics is slated for robust expansion. The anticipated market value is projected at $5.75 billion by 2029, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8%. This anticipated growth in the forecasted period can be accredited to factors such as an aging demographic, a rising embrace of robotic technology, effective tumor treatment, government backing for radiosurgery, and an increasing understanding of the advantages of radiosurgery and radiotherapy robots. Key trends during the prediction period comprise AI-assisted treatment planning, radiomics and analysis of big data, remote consultations and telesurgery, nanotechnology amalgamation, and advanced technical developments in radiosurgery robotics.\nView the full report here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/radiosurgery-and-radiotherapy-robotics-global-market-report\nWhat Are the Key Growth Drivers Fueling the Radiosurgery And Radiotherapy Robotics Market Expansion?\nThe growth of the radiosurgery and radiotherapy robotics market is anticipated to be fuelled by the growing incidence of cancer. Cancer encompasses a range of diseases that can occur in almost any organ or tissue, where abnormal cells multiply uncontrollably, breach their normal boundaries and spread to other organs or infiltrate nearby body parts. In the fight against cancer, radiosurgery and radiotherapy robotics are vitally important as they provide high geometric accuracy, support exact placement and imaging, and offer advanced therapeutic options for various cancers, such as pancreatic cancer. For example, a report published by the Switzerland-based Intergovernmental organization, World Health Organization, in February 2024, anticipates the cancer burden to rise to over 35 million in 2050 - a 77% increase from the estimated 20 million in 2022. Lung cancer remained most prevalent worldwide, accounting for 2.5 million or 12.4% of all new diagnoses, followed by breast cancer in women (2.3 million, 11.6%), colorectal cancer (1.9 million, 9.6%), prostate cancer (1.5 million, 7.3%), and stomach cancer (970,000, 4.9%). Consequently, the escalating prevalence of cancer is stimulating the growth of the radiosurgery and radiotherapy robotics market. The radiosurgery and radiotherapy robotics market's growth is also predicted to be spurred by the rising demand for minimally invasive procedures. Minimally invasive procedures (MIPs) - surgeries performed using small incisions in the body with specialized tools and cameras inserted through these incisions - are becoming increasingly preferred. Radiosurgery and radiotherapy robots are utilized in minimally invasive treatments to deliver radiation doses to cancerous entities more accurately and reliably than traditional methods, due to robots' superior precision and consistency. For instance, a report from the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, a non-profit organization based in the US, stated that out of all the medical surgeries performed in 2023, 83% were minimally invasive while the remaining 17% were traditional surgical procedures. Thus, the growing preference for minimally invasive procedures is propelling the growth of the radiosurgery and radiotherapy robotics market.\nGet your free sample here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/sample.aspx?id=12896&type=smp\nWhat Are the Key Trends Driving Radiosurgery And Radiotherapy Robotics Market Growth?\nProminent corporations in the radiosurgery and radiotherapy robotics market are concentrating on implementing innovative technological solutions such as the dynamic surface positioning and monitoring system to maintain their competitive edge. This is a patient monitoring system for surface-guided radiation therapy (SGRT) that uses a thermal-surface camera to detect patient location and movement throughout treatment. Brainlab, a Germany-based firm specializing in radiotherapy and radiosurgery software and hardware development, introduced the ExacTrac Dynamic Surface Positioning and Monitoring System in May 2023. This singular camera unit solution allows standardization across the radiation department, enabling continuous monitoring of patients during breath-hold treatments. The primary aim of ExacTrac Dynamic Surface is to ensure uniformity across the department while providing accurate patient tracking. Thanks to a single, user-friendly interface and standardized workflows, clinicians can easily adapt to using ExacTrac Dynamic Surface on any linac, reducing the learning curve.\nHow Is the Radiosurgery And Radiotherapy Robotics Market Segmented?\nThe radiosurgery and radiotherapy robotics market covered in this report is segmented -\n1) By Product: X-ray Based, Gamma-ray Based, Proton-beam Based\n2) By Application: External Beam Radiotherapy, Internal Beam Radiotherapy Or Brachytherapy\n3) By End Use: Hospitals, Clinics, Other End Users\nSubsegments:\n1) By X-ray Based: Linear Accelerators (LINAC), Stereotactic X-Ray Systems, Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) Systems\n2) By Gamma-Ray Based: Gamma Knife Systems, Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) Systems, Radioactive Isotope Systems\n3) By Proton-Beam Based: Proton Therapy Systems, Pencil Beam Scanning Systems, Fixed Beam Proton Systems\nTailor your insights and customize the full report here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/customise?id=12896&type=smp\nWhich Companies Are Leading the Charge in Radiosurgery And Radiotherapy Robotics Market Innovation?\nMajor companies operating in the radiosurgery and radiotherapy robotics market are Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Hitachi Ltd., Siemens Healthineers AG, Medtronic PLC, Elekta AB, Shinva Medical Instrument Co.
