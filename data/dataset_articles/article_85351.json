Factors contributing to the growth during the historic period encompass an increase in automation, efforts in cultural heritage preservation, a surge in demand for reverse engineering, emphasis on safety, escalating use in surveying and mapping, and a rise in demand for 3D modelling.\nHow Will the Structured Light 3D Scanner Market Size Evolve and Grow by 2029?\nThe market size for the structured light 3D scanner is anticipated to experience an accelerated expansion in the coming years, reaching an estimated value of $3.56 billion by 2029, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.4%. Factors contributing to this growth over the forecast period are higher implementation rates in construction and architectural industries, amplified demand from the automotive sector, burgeoning e-commerce and online retail, combined with the reduction in costs and accessibility. Governmental initiatives and regulations. Key trends anticipated during this forecast period involve the use of drone technology, advancements in healthcare applications, improvement in software solutions, advent of portable and handheld scanners, and incorporation of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\nView the full report here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/structured-light-3d-scanner-global-market-report\nWhat Drivers Are Propelling the Growth of Structured Light 3D Scanner Market Forward?\nThe structured light 3D scanner market is projected to expand due to the increasing growth of the gaming and entertainment industry. The sector encompasses those engaged in the production, creation, and distribution of recreational and interactive content that entertains the audience. The escalating gaming and entertainment industry growth is attributed to the popularity of esports and online gaming, the advent of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, and the widespread use of smartphones and tablets. The realistic character modelling and immersive virtual environments in the gaming and entertainment experiences are enhanced by structured-light 3D scanners. Game developers employ these scanners to capture three-dimensional models of actors, real-world objects, and props. These scanned models become the basis for the creation of realistic items, people, and creatures within the gaming universe. For example, the American Gaming Association, a US-based national trade organization, reported in May 2023 that a robust demand for gaming entertainment led to a historical high in commercial gaming revenue of $60 billion in 2022, a 14% rise from the previous year. As a result, the burgeoning gaming and entertainment industry is bolstering the growth of the structured light 3D scanner market.\nGet your free sample here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/sample.aspx?id=15006&type=smp\nWhich Emerging Trends Are Transforming the Structured Light 3D Scanner Market in 2025?\nLeading businesses in the structured light 3D scanner market are intensifying their efforts towards producing innovative products such as zoom-enabled optical 3D scanners to enhance their market revenue.
