  "text": "Respiratory Disease Vaccine: A Leading Driver Behind The Rising Incidence Of Tuberculosis Drives Growth In The Respiratory Disease Vaccine Market Market Expansion in 2025 07-31-2025 07:04 AM CET | Health & Medicine\nPress release from: The Business Research Company Respiratory Disease Vaccine Market\nUse code ONLINE30 to get 30% off on global market reports and stay ahead of tariff changes, macro trends, and global economic shifts\nWhat Will the Respiratory Disease Vaccine Industry Market Size Be by 2025?\nIn the past few years, the size of the respiratory disease vaccine market has experienced a slight increase. It is projected to rise from $69.99 billion in 2024 to $70.9 billion in 2025, demonstrating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.3%. Factors such as a growing prevalence of respiratory diseases, heightened public consciousness regarding vaccination, public health campaigns, and a widening demand for efficient and more manageable vaccines have contributed to this growth in the historical phase.\nWhat's the Long-Term Growth Forecast for the Respiratory Disease Vaccine Market Size Through 2029?\nThe market size of the respiratory disease vaccine is predicted to exhibit a consistent expansion in the upcoming years, reaching a value of $79.16 billion by 2029 with a CAGR of 2.8%. The surge during the forecasted phase can be traced back to factors such as an aging demographic, an increase in healthcare expenditure, investments funnelled into vaccines, and readiness for potential pandemics. The forecasted time frame will also see significant trends like innovative vaccine solutions, cooperative research, progression in vaccine formulation, and authorization of drugs.\nView the full report here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/respiratory-disease-vaccine-global-market-report\nWhat Are the Key Growth Drivers Fueling the Respiratory Disease Vaccine Market Expansion?\nThe escalating cases of tuberculosis are anticipated to fuel the expansion of the market for respiratory disease vaccines. Tuberculosis (TB), a respiratory ailment caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium, primarily targets the lungs and could potentially compromise other systems and organs, resulting in a variety of issues. The surge in tuberculosis cases could accelerate the production and distribution of vaccines for respiratory diseases, in an effort to curb TB proliferation. For instance, statistics from the US-based government agency, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reveal that there were 8,331 tuberculosis (TB) cases reported in the United States in 2022, signifying a 5.9% growth in the case tally compared to 2021. The incidence rate escalated to 2.5 cases for every 100,000 individuals, showing a 5.5% upsurge from the year before. Consequently, the mounting cases of tuberculosis will be a driving force for the market for respiratory disease vaccines. The rising prevalence of smoking is predicted to accelerate the expansion of the market for respiratory disease vaccines. Smoking pertains to inhaling and exhaling smoke generated by burning tobacco or tobacco-containing products, which pose a variety of health threats, such as tracheitis, heart diseases, stroke, and cancer. Vaccines for respiratory diseases can offer a certain level of protection against specific infections prevalent among smokers. For instance, information sourced from Statistics Canada, a governmental agency in Canada, indicates that cigarette production rose by 5.8% compared to June 2021. Furthermore, the total quantity of cigarettes sold witnessed a 1.3% rise from May 2022, amounting to 1.4 billion in June 2022. Hence, the escalating prevalence of smoking is fueling the growth of the market for respiratory disease vaccines.\nGet your free sample here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/sample.aspx?id=12924&type=smp\nWhat Are the Key Trends Driving Respiratory Disease Vaccine Market Growth?\nLeading corporations active in the respiratory disease vaccine market are focusing on developing cutting-edge products to boost their effectiveness and deliver superior solutions for the prevention and treatment of respiratory disease infections. For example, in May 2023, Pfizer Inc., a pharmaceutical company based in the US, secured approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ABRYSVO (Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccine), the dual respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F (RSVpreF) vaccine, intended to prevent lower respiratory tract disease instigated by respiratory syncytial virus in individuals aged 60 and above. ABRYSVO, which is an unadjuvanted vaccine consisting of two preF proteins designed to optimize immunity to RSV A and B types, has clinically demonstrated safety and efficiency.\nHow Is the Respiratory Disease Vaccine Market Segmented?\nThe respiratory disease vaccine market covered in this report is segmented -\n1) By Type: Viral Vaccine, Bacterial Vaccine, Combination Vaccine\n2) By Infection: COVID-19, Influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Pneumonia, Other Infections\n3) By Age: Infant, Adolescent, Adult\n4) By End-User: Clinic, Hospital, Other End-Users\nSubsegments:\n1) By Viral Vaccine: Influenza Vaccine, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Vaccine, Coronavirus Vaccine\n2) By Bacterial Vaccine: Pneumococcal Vaccine, Haemophilus Influenzae Type B (Hib) Vaccine, Pertussis Vaccine\n3) By Combination Vaccine: DTaP With Hib And IPV, Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine With Influenza Vaccine, MMRV\nTailor your insights and customize the full report here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/customise?id=12924&type=smp\nWhich Companies Are Leading the Charge in Respiratory Disease Vaccine Market Innovation?\nMajor companies operating in the respiratory disease vaccine market are Pfizer Inc., Johnson & Johnson Ltd., Merck & Co.
