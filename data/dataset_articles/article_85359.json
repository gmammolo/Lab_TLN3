  "text": "Unlocking Opportunities in the Robot Operating System Market: 2025-2034 Forecast Report 07-31-2025 07:07 AM CET | IT, New Media & Software\nPress release from: The Business Research Company Robot Operating System Market\nUse code ONLINE30 to get 30% off on global market reports and stay ahead of tariff changes, macro trends, and global economic shifts\nWhat Will the Robot Operating System Industry Market Size Be by 2025?\nThe market size of the robot operating system has experienced swift expansion in the past few years. The market is projected to swell from $0.71 billion in 2024 to $0.82 billion in 2025, marking a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.2%. This significant rise during the historic period is credited to multiple factors: the escalating demand for autonomous robots, shifts in operational behaviors and patterns among robots, the need for automation within established facilities, and the increasing demand within defense and security fields to boost operational capacities.\nWhat's the Long-Term Growth Forecast for the Robot Operating System Market Size Through 2029?\nIn the forthcoming years, a swift expansion is anticipated in the market size of the robot operating system. It is projected to escalate to $1.43 billion by 2029 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.0%. This advancement in the forecasted duration can be related to the escalation of automation within the industrial sector, enhanced usage of ROS by producers, increased requirement for cooperative modular robots, and the need for data-oriented robotics within the electronics sector. The primary trends during this forecast period encompass development in robotics technology, demand for the Robotics-as-a-service (RaaS) Model, evolution of collaborative robotics, and the betterment of the embedded software design.\nView the full report here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/robot-operating-system-global-market-report\nWhat Are the Key Growth Drivers Fueling the Robot Operating System Market Expansion?\nThe growth of the robot operating system market is anticipated to be propelled by an increased preference for automation in the industrial sector. Industrial automation involves the utilization of computers, robotics, and machinery to maximize and improve manufacturing processes, thereby minimizing human intervention and enhancing efficiency. The escalating use of automation within the industry is prompted by the desire for improved productivity, efficiency, cost-cutting, and better quality control. Industrial automation facilitated by robot operating systems optimizes robot control, sensor integration, interoperability, simulation, task planning, execution, and monitoring to improve efficiency further. For example, a report by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), a non-profit organization based in Germany, revealed that in September 2023, the number of industrial robot installations in industries globally was 553,052, indicating a 5% annual growth rate in 2022. Moreover, 73% of all the newly implemented robots were accounted for by Asia, trailed by Europe (15%) and the Americas (10%). Hence, escalating industrial automation adoption is propelling the robot operating system market's expansion.\nGet your free sample here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/sample.aspx?id=15261&type=smp\nWhat Are the Key Trends Driving Robot Operating System Market Growth?\nLeading corporations in the robot operating system sector are concentrating on the development of innovative integrated systems that enhance inspection solutions. These integrated systems are a harmonious merging of multiple hardware and software elements within the ROS ecosystem to constitute complete robotic solutions. For example, in March 2023, Clearpath Robotics Inc., a mobile robotic platform and automation firm based in Canada, introduced the Husky Observer, a completely integrated system that is compatible with Robot Operating Systems (ROS). This system empowers users to construct complex autonomous systems and fast-track inspection solutions. It's designated for diverse outdoor tasks such as equipment supervision, distanced virtual inspection, and comprehensive unmanned data gathering. The system also prides itself on numerous inspection and navigation sensors suitable for offline data interpretation. Armed with a wide range of sensors, users can establish points of interest and amass data for later examination. These sensors offer outdoor thermal sensor data, indoor LiDAR data, and modified thermal sensor data as part of leak detection.\nHow Is the Robot Operating System Market Segmented?\nThe robot operating system market covered in this report is segmented -\n1) By Type: Robot Operating System 1, Robot Operating System 2\n2) By Robot Type: Articulated Robots, SCARA Robots, Parallel Robots, Cartesian Robotics, Collaborative Robots\n3) By Application: Pick And Place, Plastic Injection And Blow Molding, Printed Circuit Board Handling And Information Communication And Technology, Testing And Quality Inspection, Metal Sampling And Press Trending, Computer Numerical Control Machine Trending And Co-Packing, End Of Line Packaging, Mapping And Navigation, Inventory Management, Other Applications\n4) By Industry Vertical: Healthcare, Automotive, Electrical And Electronics, Metal And Machinery, Food And Beverages, Rubber And Plastic, Other Industry Verticals\nSubsegments:\n1) By Robot Operating System 1: ROS 1.x, ROS 1.0 (LTS version)\n2) By Robot Operating System 2: ROS 2 Foxy, ROS 2 Galactic, ROS 2 Humble, ROS 2 Iron, ROS 2 Rolling (Development Version)\nTailor your insights and customize the full report here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/customise?id=15261&type=smp\nWhich Companies Are Leading the Charge in Robot Operating System Market Innovation?\nMajor companies operating in the robot operating system market report are Microsoft Corporation; ABB Ltd.; Omron Corporation; FANUC Corporation; Yaskawa America Inc.; Staubli International AG; KEBA AG; Wind River Systems Inc.; KUKA AG; Intrinsic Innovation LLC; Clearpath Robotics Inc.; Fetch Robotics Inc.; Robotiq Inc.; Husarion Sp. zo. o.; Cyberbotics Ltd.; Robotis Co.
