  "text": "Jul. 31, 2025\nAgrovista is taking its rigorous seed selection policy a step further this coming autumn with the introduction of Establishment Plus cereal seed to help crops achieve maximum potential.\nEstablishment Plus seed is harvested from crops treated with 3ALO T6P, a unique foliar treatment that maximises grain filling and produces healthier grain.\nIn trials, Establishment Plus seed has resulted in improved establishment, more ears/sq m and higher yields.\nArable product manager Ted Williams says: ″High quality seed selection has always been a recognised criterion at Agrovista. The introduction of Establishment Plus seed across our cereal range as standard is a natural progression of this policy.\n″Given the many challenges farmers face, successful establishment remains key to profitable cropping and clearly this all starts with seed.″\n3 ALO T6P is an advanced biostimulant technology which enhances the mobilisation and translocation of sucrose into developing kernels or seeds. ″This improvement in maternal seed quality carries forward, delivering a yield advantage not only in the treated crop but also in the next generation,″ says Ted.\n″Establishment Plus seed benefits from enhanced grain size, higher yield potential, and improved stress resilience, particularly under drought conditions.″\nIn manufacturer trials, seed taken from crops treated with 3ALO T6P gave up to a 15% increase in plants/m² in the autumn, improved crop biomass and increased ear counts, leading to an 8% yield increase over non-treated seed in a first wheat situation. These findings were supported by independent research.\nEstablishment Plus seed will be supplied as standard across Agrovista’s cereal seed portfolio at no additional cost.\nSubscribe Email: | * | |\nName: | ||\nMobile Number: | ||\n0/1200",
