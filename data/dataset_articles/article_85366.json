  "text": "Jul. 31, 2025\nOver a thousand scans. Zero shelling. Instant results. That's the promise of the newly launched SCIO Mini 2, a device that helps US corn growers and seed producers measure moisture in the field, which builds on the success of SCIO Mini 1. The new device has already been adopted by agriculture leaders such as Corteva and Syngenta.\nLaunched by SCIO, the ag-tech innovator formerly known as Consumer Physics, the SCIO Mini 2 features a sleek, more durable design that enhances field efficiency. It continues to deliver instant, accurate, and non-destructive corn moisture analysis - no preparation required. It uses near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and syncs with SCIO's cloud-based platform. Together, these features support faster and better data-driven decision-making for harvest, storage, and field management decisions. With over 13 million scans logged by 10,000 users across 186 countries, SCIO continues to push the boundaries of handheld spectroscopy.\nFor US agriculture, the stakes are massive. In 2023 alone, farmers produced 15.3 billion bushels of corn for grain valued at $73.9 billion. The corn sector generated $151 billion in total economic activity, including $62 billion added to US GDP. With rising costs and shrinking harvest windows, real-time field analysis tools are becoming essential.\nWhat's new in SCIO Mini 2\nSCIO Mini 2 builds on the proven capabilities of its predecessor, SCIO Mini, with a refined design and enhanced features tailored for more efficient and reliable field use. Upgrades include:\nBuilt-in corn ear accessory\nNo more attachments—the corn accessory is now seamlessly integrated into the device, streamlining the workflow in the field.\nHigher scan capacity per charge\nA new high-capacity battery: supports over 1,000 scans per charge, compared to around 250 scans in SCIO Mini 1.\nImproved durability with IP53 rating\nDesigned for rugged environments, the SCIO Mini 2 resists dust and water spray, enabling confident outdoor operation.\nSleek, ergonomic design\nThe modernized form factor improves comfort and ease of use, both indoors and outdoors.\nFaster, more reliable performance\nA new light source and internal improvements enhance robustness and scanning accuracy.\nConvenient USB-C charging\nReplaces the older Micro-USB with faster and more user-friendly USB-C charging.\nSCIO Mini 2 builds on the strong capabilities and massive adoption of SCIO Mini 1, which allows farmers to scan a cob and see moisture levels within seconds, without the need for shelling or grinding. In SCIO Mini 2, Bluetooth sync allows data to flow straight into mobile apps or cloud dashboards.\n\"For the seed tech manager walking 20-acre plots in August heat, speed matters,\" said Damian Goldring, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at SCIO. \"SCIO Mini 2 puts precision in the palm of your hand. In seconds, you know whether to harvest or hold.\"\nThe device has already seen rapid uptake among leading names in the agri-food sector, including Syngenta and Corteva. Producers have reported cutting testing time by more than 50%, improving harvest timing, storage strategies, and cost control.\nThe device requires little to no training, with a user-friendly and portable design suited for in-field use.\n\"We're building tools that deliver more than data; they deliver confidence in the field,\" added Goldring.\nSubscribe Email: | * | |\nName: | ||\nMobile Number: | ||\n0/1200",
