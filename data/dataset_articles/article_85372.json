  "text": "Jul. 31, 2025\nA biostimulant developed by Portuguese company Tecniferti in partnership with the Rhizobacteria Laboratory (Rhizolab) at the University of Aveiro has demonstrated its continuing efficacy in field trials. With the positive results obtained, Tecniferti and Rhizolab are now proceeding with the commercial registration of their discovery.\nThe biostimulant is formulated from bacterial strains of the genera Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, and Bacillus. The Portuguese liquid fertilizer manufacturer's focus is to find microorganisms that promote plant growth.\nNitrogen-fixing and phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria play a crucial role in improving soil fertility and promoting plant growth. They are particularly important in sustainable agricultural practices, as they make essential nutrients available naturally and efficiently.\nIn the case of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, these can fix atmospheric nitrogen through a biological process. These bacteria thrive in aerobic soils with neutral to slightly acidic pH and rich in organic matter, where they find sufficient energy to activate the fixation process. Key benefits include reducing the need for chemical nitrogen fertilizers and increasing nitrogen availability for non-leguminous plants.\nPhosphorus-solubilizing bacteria, such as those of the Enterobacter genus, are capable of solubilizing complexed phosphorus in soil. This process occurs through various biological mechanisms, including organic acids and other chelating agents, and through enzymes, such as phytases and phosphatases, which transform insoluble forms of phosphorus, such as calcium and iron phosphates, into forms that plants can absorb.\nAs benefits, these bacteria increase the efficiency of applied phosphorus use, stimulate root development, and improve plants' nutrient absorption capacity, protecting the environment and increasing sustainability.\nEasyNut Tecnología, an agronomic consulting company specializing in tree nuts, conducted a trial on walnut trees to evaluate the effectiveness of bacterial application. The objective was to verify improved phosphorus and nitrogen assimilation by plants, and its impact on fruit yield and caliber.\nManuel Machadinha, EasyNut Tecnología's manager for the Iberian Peninsula, states that throughout the analyzed period, there was a more pronounced reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus percentage in the leaves of walnut trees in the control plot, compared to the leaves of walnut trees subjected to bacterial application.\nAccording to Machadinha, this means \"the treated plant worked comfortably for a longer time, that is, it managed to transfer the necessary nutrients for fruit growth for a longer period, so foliar analyses reveal less nutrient loss.\"\n\"At EasyNut Tecnología, we have an important technological development component; we seek new solutions that allow farmers to be more efficient. And with these bacteria, we enhance a living soil with more active microorganisms. The trial's objective was to test whether this solution allows walnut production with greater efficiency, greater sustainability, and greater profitability,\" he added. This Chilean company provides assistance to more than 2,500 hectares of walnut, almond, pistachio, hazelnut, and pecan orchards in Portugal and Spain.\nAfter harvest, a quality analysis was performed on 100 walnuts from each trial modality, comparing the control with the treatment/application, evaluating factors such as kernel color, caliber, yield, and internal and external damage.\nAdded Machadinha, \"Differences in edible kernel yield were verified, with a 10% increase in trees treated with bacteria, compared to the control. This indicates that bacterial application may have contributed to better nutrient absorption, the plant worked more, performed more photosynthesis, and accumulated more carbohydrates in the fruits, resulting in a higher proportion of usable fruit kernel.\"\nThe most significant impact on edible kernel yield indicates that this technology may be especially relevant for optimizing quality and caliber, increasing the commercial value of production. This suggests that the bacteria had a positive impact on nutrient availability and absorption, favoring more efficient and homogeneous fruit growth.\n\"If we apply these bacteria in orchards, we can significantly reduce nitrogen and phosphorus application, and this represents a lower cultivation cost for the producer, less cost per kg of walnut, and greater profitability,\" noted Machadinha, adding that fertilization can represent one-fifth of walnut cultivation costs.\n(Editing by Leonardo Gottems, reporter for AgroPages)\nSubscribe Email: | * | |\nName: | ||\nMobile Number: | ||\n0/1200",
