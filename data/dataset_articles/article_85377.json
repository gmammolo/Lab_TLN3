  "text": "Jul. 31, 2025\nSumil Chemicals Industries Pvt. Ltd. recently organized a Business Partner Meet in Bhopal to unveil four new agricultural products aimed at enhancing crop productivity and farmer profitability.\nAt the event, the company officially launched four new products – Granulam, Verdena, Nutrob, and Speno – under its crop protection and nutrition portfolio.\nAddressing the distributors virtually, Director Mrs. Komal emphasized the company’s commitment to delivering world-class products at affordable prices to Indian farmers. She acknowledged the distributors’ role in reaching these innovations to the grassroots and appreciated their ongoing support for Sumil’s growth.\nMr. Bhoir gave an overview of Sumil Chemicals’ journey and shared the company’s strategic vision for the future. Mr. Patel discussed the market potential and business outlook of the newly launched products, highlighting how distributors can leverage them for commercial success.\nMr. Saha introduced the technical features of the patented insecticides Speno and Granulam. Speno, a unique formulation containing 0.53% Chlorantraniliprole and Sulphur, is recommended at a dose of 4 kg per acre. Granulam, a granular product, contains 24% Lambda-Cyhalothrin. It not only provides long-term pest protection but also supports residue breakdown of other nutrients and minimizes skin irritation for applicators — a key user-friendly innovation.\nMr. Ravish Singh elaborated on the importance of crop nutrition and presented detailed insights into Nutrob and Verdena, launched under the company’s bio-solutions segment. These products aim to provide sustainable nutrition and improve soil health.\nA comprehensive product presentation was delivered by Mr. Pawar and Mr. Lenka providing in-depth knowledge of the composition, application, and benefits of each product.\nWith these new launches, Sumil Chemicals aims to strengthen its position in the crop input industry and support Indian farmers with effective, safe, and innovative solutions.\nThe launch event was attended by top company executives including Mr. Prakash Bhoir (Chief Business Head), Mr. N.B.
