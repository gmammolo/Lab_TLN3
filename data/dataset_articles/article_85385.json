  "text": "Jul. 31, 2025\nThe Brazilian multinational Nitro has announced a strategic partnership with the startup Symbiomics, also a Brazilian company, to develop biological inoculants for tropical agriculture.\nThe initiative combines Nitro's industrial capacity with Symbiomics' biotechnology portfolio, with the goal of launching innovative products for plant nutrition, based upon unprecedented microbial strains.\n\"Although we see this as one of the fastest-growing markets in agriculture, we see little innovation; the products are always very similar,\" according to Rafael Souza, CEO and co-founder of Symbiomics. It is worth noting that the company has a collection of more than 12,000 different microorganisms collected from various locations across the country. About 30% of them are new, meaning there are no products yet made based upon them.\nWhile Symbiomics enters the market with the portfolio, Nitro will bring the industrial potential. Both companies will work on the practical side of research and development of the new materials. ″We want to take a leading position in innovation. In the biological products segment, our goal is to grow almost sevenfold. Today we have a market share of just over 1.4%; we want to exceed 6%, and to do so, we need new products,″ said Nitro's marketing director, Jonas Cuzzi.\nFocus on nutrition and new crops\nThe partnership's first objective is inoculants, which act on soil and plant nutrition through the action of microorganisms. Studies will focus on the supply of the most demanded nutrients in agriculture: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK).\nAdditionally, these companies' proposal is to develop solutions that go beyond major crops, such as soybeans and corn, also serving less-exploited crops, especially in regions with greater climate stress, such as the Cerrado.\nThe companies estimate that the partnership's first products could reach the market as early as the 2027/2028 harvest, and could be brought forward if the validation, scaling, and registration processes advance more quickly.\n(Editing by Leonardo Gottems, reporter for AgroPages)\nSubscribe Email: | * | |\nName: | ||\nMobile Number: | ||\n0/1200",
