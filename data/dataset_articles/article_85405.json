  "text": "Dr. Boris Marx producing PLA blend with a stereo-complex crystal structure at the Fiber Institute in Bremen. Photo Credit: AIF\nTechnical fibers make the ropes of children’s swings safe or are indispensable in medical operations. The base material for these fibers are often petroleum-based polymers. In view of the limited availability of fossil raw materials and challenges with plastics, Dr. Boris Marx from the Fiber Institute Bremen eV (FIBRE, Germany) is looking for alternatives with biopolymers. He is one of the nominees for the 2022 Otto von Guericke Prize Scientists for special innovative achievements in the field of pre-competitive industrial joint research (IGF) — which builds a bridge between basic research and commercial application — funded by the Federal Ministry of Economics via public funds.\nBiopolymers such as polylactide (PLA) consist of bio-based, renewable raw materials and, in contrast to the usual polymers made from petroleum, are biodegradable. PLA is made by chemical synthesis based on lactic acid. Commercially available PLA is processed into yarns that can currently be used for home textiles, for example. However, the strengths for technical applications are not yet sufficient.",
