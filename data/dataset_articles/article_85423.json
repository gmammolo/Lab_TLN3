  "text": "Apple has rolled out the iOS 18.6 update for iPhone users this week, just a few days after the company started the iOS 26 public beta program. This could be the last in the iOS 18 universe, before the company fixes the chinks and bugs with the iOS 26 version that will be announced with the iPhone 17 series in the next few months. This is the smallest iOS 18 update we have received till date which hints at minimal focus on new features and primarily aiming to fix any possible stability issues.\niOS 18.6 Update: Brings Major Security Fixes\nApple has confirmed the iOS 18.6 update details with its release notes that tells us more about the new version rolling out. The company says its new update fixes important bugs and security issues.\nAnd one of the issues was linked to the Photos app that has now been resolved. The company also has fixed the security issue that may have enabled attackers to spoof websites on Safari and target devices to control their actions.\nadvetisement In addition to protecting the devices, Apple is also making it possible to download apps from websites, which has become mandatory in the EU regions. You can even install third-party app stores on iPhones in these countries, something that Android has supported for many years. Apple will obviously share its guidelines to make sure that iPhone users don’t fall for the wrong/malicious websites from where they download the apps or the app store itself.\ntop videos View All\nHamas Accused Israel Of Delaying Aid To Gaza, Says May Affect Hostage Release | Gaza Aid | N18G DeepSeek Vs OpenAI | Microsoft And Openai Probe Unauthorized Data Access Linked To Deepseek Ai |N18G DeepSeek: Meet Liang Wenfeng, the mind behind China’s AI startup competing OpenAI | N18G | News18 China’s New Chatbot DeepSeek Sparks Controversy with Built-In Censorship | Dalai Lama | News18 |N18G DeepSeek vs ChatGPT vs Gemini: Who Wins the AI Battle? | AI War | Chinese AI Model Challenge | N18V View all The iOS 18.6 update comes with a download package of 762 MB which is far less than the usual 10GB or more size that we have seen over the previous iOS 18.6 beta updates in the last few weeks.\n The new iOS 26 beta 4 update brings a slew of new features and some design changes that have got people talking. Most of you would remember the Liquid Glass interface that Apple unveiled at the WWDC 25 keynote with the iOS 26 version, and later tweaked to look less glassy but that has now been reverted back to its default state.\nAbout the Author S Aadeetya S Aadeetya, Special Correspondent at News18 Tech, accidentally got into journalism 10 years ago, and since then, has been part of established media houses covering the latest trends in technology and helping friends make the right gadget buy.
