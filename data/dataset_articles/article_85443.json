  "text": "Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is reportedly making its biggest data center investment in Asia with a $6 billion project in India's Andhra Pradesh state.\nGoogle's 1-GW Data Center And Renewable Push\nThe Alphabet subsidiary plans to build a 1-gigawatt data center in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam, reported Reuters, citing two state officials.\nThe project includes developing the necessary power infrastructure, with $2 billion specifically allocated for green energy capacity to power the facility.\nGoogle did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comments.\nSee Also: Elon Musk Loses $34 Billion As Tesla Sheds $153 Billion Amid Feud With Trump—Here's How The Billionaire's Fortune Has Fared So Far In 2025\nIndian State Hints At More Big-Tech Investments\nThe Andhra Pradesh government has not yet formally confirmed the deal. Nara Lokesh, the state's IT minister, currently in Singapore for investment talks, hinted at major upcoming announcements, saying, \"There are certain announcements which are not yet public. In October, we will make those announcements.\"\nLokesh stated that the state has already secured 1.6 GW of data center capacity commitments and aims to build an additional 6 GW within the next five years.\nTo further support the data hub ecosystem, Andhra Pradesh plans to build three undersea cable landing stations in Visakhapatnam and expand power generation—potentially reaching 10 GW in the next five years, the report said.\nHow Google Is Making History\nGoogle's investment marks a significant milestone in Asia's digital infrastructure race and aligns with Alphabet's $75 billion global data center expansion strategy. This also marks the Alphabet-owned unit's inaugural data center project in India.\nPrice Action: Alphabet Inc.’s Class A shares dipped 0.32% to $195.90 in after-hours trading, while Class C shares fell 0.27% to $196.90, per Benzinga Pro.\nAccording to Benzinga's Edge Stock Rankings, GOOGL continues to demonstrate strong upward momentum across short, medium and long-term timeframes.
